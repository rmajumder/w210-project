  "<p>British house prices last month recorded their biggest increase this year according to the Halifax, prompting fears the Bank of England may raise interest rates in response.</p> <p>The 1.6% rise during September undercut the assumption that the price boom of recent years had reached a plateau.</p> <p>The Bank of England, which starts its monthly review of interest rates today, has been concerned that higher house prices encourages people to save less and spend more, fuelling a consumer boom that can quickly run out of control.</p> <p>These fears were cited among others for its decision to raise rates four times between September 1999 and February this year.</p> <p>But with the Nationwide Building Society releasing conflicting figures, citing a 0.4% gain last month, most analysts believe the Bank of England will overcome its concern and follow its American counterpart in keeping policy steady.</p> <p>The Halifax - Britain's biggest mortgage lender - said that house prices rose by 1.6% in September to stand 9.2% higher on the year. That compares with growth of 0.5% in August, and an annual rate of 7.4%. Nationwide Building Society figures for last month show a smaller 0.4% gain in house prices.</p> <p>Economists explain the discrepancy by pointing out that the Nationwide is more biased to the south of England, where prices have been under greater pressure following heady rises seen in recent years. However, the Nationwide's annual rate of house inflation at 10.2% is higher than the Halifax's estimate. In the Halifax series, the annual rate has now returned to the level seen in June, though it remains well below the 16.0% peak reached in January. September marked the third monthly rise in a row following four falls during the five months between February and June. \"Overall, the latest monthly figures suggest that the housing market has stabilised following the sharp slowdown earlier in the year,\" the Halifax report said. </p> <p>The bank said the fall in prices between February and June appeared to have been a temporary correction following a period of rapidly rising prices. </p> <p>While it felt that housing demand was likely to be underpinned by a sound economic background, \"the rise in September is unlikely to mark a return to rapid house price inflation\". </p> <p>The Halifax said the average price of a home is now a seasonally-adjusted \u00a386,304.</p>",
  "<p>Barely have our Olympic team stepped off the plane and already someone is taking a pin to the bubble of national pride we have from the Sydney games. According to a report out this week, British workers should be given a medal of their own - for being among the most miserable in the world. </p> <p>In a survey of more than 200 international businesspeople, just 25% of Britons said they were happy at work, compared with 54% of Americans. Furthermore, while more than 80% of the Australian and French respondents - and 100% of the Americans - cited their home among the top countries in the world in which to work, only 38% of Britons did so. And in the overall vote on the most miserable country in which to work, Britain took bronze, coming third after China and Japan. </p> <p>The list of statistics goes on, with British workers consistently rating our western working counterparts as having more blessed working lives than us. It is a damning indictment of our own job market, but one which is hardly surprising when you scour the lengthy list of complaints that arise out of the way we work. We may be used to working the longest and most insecure days in Europe, but the message of this research is clear: we don't have to like it. </p> <p>Carolyn Asome, who used to teach in France, can relate to the research. Recalling her days there with fondness, she says: \"Over there the working conditions are so much better. The hours are shorter, the job security is stronger and there are really good state benefits - if you don't earn over a certain amount you get a great rebate for your rent,\" she says. \"All the time I was there, unions were fighting for better conditions. They were really successful, but the irony is the conditions are far worse over here.\" </p> <p>Likewise, Clare Macfarlane, an advertising account executive, enjoyed the relaxing year she spent working in Australia. \"There was a definite mass exodus from the office at five o'clock every day, and it's certainly not like that over here,\" she says. Even the managing director took a relaxed approach to the company commitments: \"He was definitely more interested in what he was doing at the weekend. But that could be to do with the quality of life in Australia. They definitely get their priorities right.\" </p> <p>Ben Williams, an Edinburgh-based chartered corporate psychologist, preaches a similar relaxed attitude. \"We have to try to have more fun at work,\" he says. \"I spend most of my professional career optimising the performance of people at work, and one of the things that does that best is a willingness to play, share and enjoy. It is something workers in this country really have yet to master.\" </p> <p>Part of the problem with Britain is that our priorities are all over the place. As work dominates our lives, we become more and more subservient by the day. The confrontations between unions and managements are long gone, and in their place sits a drained, clock-watching workforce which does nothing but moan. As Williams puts it: \"We're much less positive about things. We have a less can-do attitude than some of the other parts of the world where they make things happen.\" </p> <p>In France, where unions have fought for high levels of job security, generous state pensions and high levels of company-funded insurance, workers can, of course, afford to be happier. </p> <p>Yet, as in our resignation to the death of union strength and workers' rights, there is a very British defeatism in denouncing ourselves as one of the western world's worst places to work. Given the chance in the survey, other nationalities rated us highly as a good place to earn a crust. It may well be an outsider's misconception, but Professor Cary Cooper, the occupational psychologist who analysed the research, believes the foreigner takes the correct standpoint. He puts Britain's poor performance in the league table of happy workers down as more of a reflection of the British psyche than of poor working culture. </p> <p> 'We have a very negative view of ourselves,\" says Cooper. \"British people always seem to put themselves down a lot more than other countries. In the same way the Americans show their arrogance by unanimously saying they hail from one of the world's top three places to work, so we British show our self-effacing and demure side by constantly labelling ourselves a national failure.\" </p> <p>It is a conclusion that Williams is equally quick to draw from the findings. \"You can't change the results of 150 years of British social and economic history, and that history has taught us that it pays to keep your place and be humble,\" he says. \"We have a natural reserve about us and a kind of enforced inferiority complex which keeps us down and in our place. That is the reason we find the Americans and Australians and all the Brits who went overseas to form the New World as being very cocky, arrogant and pushy.\" </p> <p>So, work-wise, we conform to our national stereotypes - the arrogant Americans meet the diffident Brits. Yet the stigma is acceptable only because we manufactured it. It is a national habit to malign our own assets and habits but, of course, completely unacceptable to hear anyone else make a similar slur. The British workforce should rest assured: the moment another country labels us a nation of miseryguts there will be a scramble to defend ourselves. </p> <p><strong>Work in Britain: the foreign view</strong></p> <p><strong> The recruitment agency worker:</strong><br> For the past nine months Sarah Kinney, from Canada, has worked for S&amp;G Recruitment in London. She believes employment is very different here. \"There seems to be a lot more paper shuffling and shifting here, and more middle management, more invented jobs. The whole attitude to work is different - people work hard all week and play hard at the weekend. In Vancouver, everyone's very laid-back.\" Originally Sarah wanted to work with children, but she found it didn't pay enough. </p> <p><strong> The brand marketing manager:</strong><br> Originally from Italy, Christina Fedi has also worked in Paris. She is now employed by Channel 4, and prefers having a job in the UK: \"There are more media jobs available, and it is easier to change jobs or be a freelancer,\" she says. One difficulty she has encountered is excessive politeness: \"People are not very confrontational at work. If you want to express an opinion you have to package it in a nice way, listen to what they say and then say 'I understand what you're saying, but...' It becomes a very lengthy process.\" </p> <p><strong> The academic: </strong><br> American-born Steve Greenwold, the deputy head of Birmingham University's school of social sciences, cannot imagine ever working anywhere but the UK. \"Maybe people here are less well paid compared to the rich Germans and Americans, but they're funny, amusing and cooperative,\" he says. \"And the work ethic is strong; it's very strong in America, but it's equally strong here, and I don't think that's a source of grumpiness. My experience is that people who are in jobs that are fulfilling seem content with their lot.\" </p> <p><strong> The trainee lawyer:</strong><br> Zohar Zik, from Israel, works for a firm of solicitors in London. After completing a degree at Cardiff law school he started his legal training last October. He too prefers working in London: \"I feel much more comfortable in London - plus there are better job prospects for me here as an Israeli graduate from a British university. There are better working conditions here in terms of hours and pay; I still have to work a long day, but I am paid more than I was in Israel. The hours are incredibly long there and the pay is very low. This is not the only reason I chose to stay here, but it is a significant factor.\" </p> <p><strong> The management consultant:</strong><br> Ilan leshem, from Germany, has worked in London for two-and-a-half years. He says: \"Germany has nicer, more modern offices, but that's not so important to me. The bonuses you get in the City of London are incomparable with elsewhere, but salaries at the lower end of the market definitely aren't as good here. One big difference is holiday entitlement. In Germany you can expect to get about 30 days' holiday, as opposed to 20. You also get more national days off. Having said that, there are other perks, like getting a day in lieu if I have to work a weekend.\"</p>",
  "Maths should not be a compulsory subject at secondary school and is no more valuable than sociology, according to an educationist in a study published today. <p>Steve Bramall, lecturer in philosophy of education at London University's institute of education, said maths was \"a restricted and limited means of describing and communicating about the world ... it can be no more than a means to an end\". </p> <p>Mr Bramall argued: \"What is good, what is worthwhile, what is important and what things mean ... are aspects of reality that can't be grasped from a mathematical perspective.\" </p> <p>Other curriculum subjects \"appear more suited to providing the sort of education needed for living an adult life in which deliberation about values, meanings and actions feature\". </p> <p>In the study, Why Learn Maths?, published by the institute, he added: \"Immediately one might think about sociology, a subject expressly committed to developing in pupils an awareness and appreciation of the contexts of moral and political action.\" </p> <p>Mr Bramall said that while \"a calculator, a computer, a friend or an independent financial adviser can substitute for an education in mathematics for instrumental purposes ... I certainly cannot leave it to others to decide what my values are without giving up my much-cherished personal autonomy.\" </p> <p>Mr Bramall's view is echoed by others in the collection of essays. </p> <p>Paul Ernest, professor of mathematical education at Exeter University, said: \"The utility of academic and school mathematics in the modern world is greatly overestimated.\" </p> <p>He argued: \"Of course there is a need for a small elite who control the information systems and mechanisms, and a group of specialist technicians to service or programme them. However, this group represents a tiny minority within society and their very special needs should not determine the goals of mathematics education for all higher mathematical knowledge and competence, ie beyond the level of numeracy achieved at primary or elementary school, is not needed by the majority of the populace to ensure the economic success of modern industrialised society.\" </p> <p>John White, professor of philosophy of education at the institute, and Mr Bramall's co-editor in the study, said there was \"an unchallengeable argument\" that children should learn basic mathematics, but said that could be achieved be getting to level four in tests at age 11. </p> <p>But Eric Blaire, a mathematics inspector in the west London borough of Hillingdon, said in the collection that Mr Bramall's argument was \"essentially naive\" and recommended that maths be taught for the length of compulsory schooling. </p> <p>\"It is the disciplined imagining of mathematics that provides the special form of thinking that pupils need developed as long as possible,\" Mr Blaire said. </p> <p>He added: \"We need to be taught it well until the age of 16 and perhaps longer, so that those who influence the next generation will be positive about mathematics.\" </p> <p>Another study by the institute last month called for a rethink of maths teaching, accusing politicians of underestimating its importance. </p> <p>\u0095 Students' university applications should contain no mention of their school or background to ensure those from independent schools are not the victims of discrimination, headteachers heard last night. </p> <p>In a speech to the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, Vivian Anthony, the organisation's retiring secretary, warned that it without such a move universities would soon find themselves facing legal action.The conference represents 242 independent school heads. </p> <p>Sir Howard Newby, president of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, rejected the call. \"The more information we have the better. I think the fears of the kind of discrimination he describes are groundless.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Human Rights Act 1998 which came into force yesterday, marks a legal and constitutional sea change. Like the Part-time and Working time Directives before it, despite widespread optimism, the new Act is unlikely to be a panacea for all our human rights ills. Most experts agree that the actual impact of the Act for workers is wholly dependent on the outcome of test cases in the courts. </p> <p>Our experience with the judiciary is that the wheels of justice grind pretty slowly, and not at all for some workers. Hundreds of agency staff in colleges still fall through the loopholes of the law. But there is cause for some hope that the act is the beginning of a new era. It should mark the beginning of \"real cultural changes\" bringing us a step closer to creating a \"a human rights culture\" in the UK. </p> <p>We are convinced that colleges are covered by the act. Under the definition of a \"public authority\" education is, after all, a public function. </p> <p>Lecturers and other staff in college should raise their expectations that their employers will now comply with the culture of fairness, security, respect and freedom, as laid down by the act. We have a real opportunity to challenge further the macho-management style culture so preva lent in the 90s, when college lecturers were seen coldly as \"units of resource\". If we can use the Human Rights Act as a lever to move back into a world where staff are regarded and treated as human beings then October 3 will go down as a great day. </p> <p>In this new era of \"rights culture\", we may stand a better chance of addressing some of Natfhe's pressing concerns like academic freedom, bullying at work, and discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and religion. </p> <p> Both domestic and European Courts have tended to lack vigour when it comes to finding for the plaintiff in sexual orientation cases, so the Act is likely to give our anti-discrimination campaign fresh ammunition. Our ability to legally resist discrimination on the grounds of age, religion, and sexual orientation will be bolstered even further when Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam is incorporated into UK law; and we stand ready to use it. </p> <p>Article 3 of the Human Rights Act, \"the right not to be subjected to degrading treatment or punishment\", could help stamp out the worst cases of severe bullying and victimisation. And obviously the right to freedom of expression should underpin academic freedom and protection for whistle-blowers. Perhaps if the Act had been in place and tested five years ago, Natfhe would not have seen so many activists who challenged their colleges' behaviour swept away by the fiction of redundancy. </p> <p>The right to privacy can be used to restrict employers' surveillance of staff, outlawing secret email and telephone surveillance; and the \"right to respect for private and family life\" (Article 8) could be used in conjunction with the Working Time Directive to challenge the long hours culture that has become so endemic and damaging in colleges. </p> <p>Finally, the right to education, limited though it is, might be used to challenge colleges whose provision excludes sections of the community, especially those with special needs. </p> <p>If past experience is anything to go by, many colleges probably won't rush headlong to embrace these new opportunities to extend their employees' human rights. To those we issue a word of warning. The Human Rights Act has been a long time coming, and lawyers have been watching these developments as jays eye up a newly seeded lawn. Natfhe want to see the acts benefits stretched to the absolute limit of the law. </p> <p>Industrial relations founders so often on the absence or non-operation of fair, transparent and accepted procedures. We've recently negotiated a raft of new national agreements/guidelines on employment practices with further education employers. Some are not as good as we believe to be necessary, but their adoption in many colleges would be an advance. Natfhe is calling on every employer to do a health check and get themselves in shape for the new era. This legislation provides another reason for doing so. </p> <p> \u0095 Paul Mackney is general secretary of Natfhe</p>",
  "<p>Body piercing studios in the high street are now almost as familiar as a certain ubiquitous hamburger chain. Sporting jewellery through navel, nose or nipple has become a very mainstream fashion statement. So it is only when a rare case such as that of 39-year-old Lesley Hovvells of Llanelli, south Wales who died of septicaemia following 118 piercings, hits the headlines that we are reminded of the medical dimension. </p> <p>A verdict of misadventure was recorded on Hovvells at an inquest last week. Coroner William Owen said: \"There is a considerable risk in body piercings unless hygiene is maintained. Miss Hovvells neglected these precautions and died as a direct result.\" </p> <p>The hygiene practices of both the piercer and the pierced are absolutely crucial to prevent potentially fatal septicaemia or other infections, but as long as sensible precautions are taken, complications are unlikely to arise. Risks exist because of inconsistencies in current legislation. Cowboy piercers outside London can operate legally without a local authority licence - only London boroughs can license piercing premises after carrying out checks to ensure that they use sterile equipment and give clients proper advice about aftercare. </p> <p>Anna Kai was one of the first female body piercers to move into what was, in the early 90s, a very male-dominated scene closely linked to tattooing. Now she runs one of the biggest body-piercing operations in the UK, the Manchester and Leeds Bodypiercing Company. She is worried about under-16s who are dedicated followers of fashion but have little awareness of the dangers. </p> <p>\"We always turn children away but there's a piercing business I know of which makes between \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000 a week out of business we refuse to take on.\" Kai takes the medical aspect very seriously - she spent three years at medical school before gaining a qualification as a radiographer and paramedic. </p> <p>\"Apart from scrupulous hygiene there are two main things to be aware of - people fainting during or after a piercing, and bleeding,\" she says. Her customers have to fill out a very detailed medical form and she urges them to be frank about any medical condition, even if they don't consider it to be relevant. </p> <p>\"One person had psoriasis on her arm but didn't mention it when she came to have her navel pierced. She returned after the piercing saying she had developed psoriasis in her navel. She hadn't mentioned the condition because she'd never had it around the navel and didn't think the fact that she had it on her arm was relevant.\" </p> <p>Sometimes medical conditions can reveal themselves for the first time during a piercing. \"If someone faints we check their blood pressure for a while before letting them go. One man didn't recover very well and I suspected his blood sugar was low. We took him to hospital and he was diagnosed as having diabetes.\" </p> <p>People who seek out piercing will often not own up to having conditions like HIV or Hepatitis C. \"We treat everyone as if they have something very infectious, as that's the only way to be safe,\" says Kai. </p> <p>Health issues are not always uppermost in the minds of those who seek out piercings. According to James Glover, a north London piercer who has 24 piercings, aesthetics are a major consideration: \"For some people getting a new piercing is the same as getting a new outfit or a new hairdo. Having a piercing done can be slightly painful and there is a sense of having achieved something.\" </p> <p>After its cult beginnings, piercing has been propelled into the mainstream. So sanitised has it become that even Barbie was set to add a nose stud to her fluffy pink wardrobe - toymakers Mattel dropped the plans only when parents voiced opposition. </p> <p>Social psychologist Dr Martin Skinner believes that it has always been a way of controlling how the body looks. \"Someone with a lot of body piercings takes the initiative in an encounter. A piercing is very in-your-face, it's almost like a wound. Someone with piercings does not look soft and sweet, you are forced to look at them on their terms.\" </p> <p>While piercing is often seen as an expression of individuality he believes there is also an element of belonging to a club. He also argues that even those who have scores of piercings are not addicted to the practice but rather demonstrate the qualities of a collector. \"It's a consumer thing, like acquiring a new car or a new pair of shoes.\" </p> <p>But for some trendsetters the buzz has begun to pall. Slicing the tongue down the middle to create a forked effect and placing small Teflon beads under the skin to create a scaly appearance are the newest crazes. Kai and others say they want to wait and see what the medical implications of these latest forms are before deciding whether to add them to their repertoire. So it may be a while before models sashay down the catwalk with chopped tongues and beads from their dresses sewn into their skin.</p>",
  "<p>There are certain things Vera Brewer was and was not told after her sister Irene Godfrey's death in October last year, at the Oxford Heart Centre. While she believes she was kept in the dark, the Oxford centre, for its part, points out that it operates a policy of duty of patient confidentiality. </p> <p>Vera Brewer was not told, for instance, that after her sister's valve replacement surgery in September, a surgical swab had been left inside her body when her chest was closed post-operation. She also had no idea that there were four further operations to retrieve that swab, or that a DNR (do not resuscitate) order had been made. After Irene Godrey died a month later, all Brewer was advised was that no post mortem was necessary. </p> <p>Vera Brewer is one of several relatives who this week are expressing concern over patients' and relatives' rights to information in the medical arena. In the light of an NHS inquiry, the Oxford centre's chief executive, David Highton, has set out to assure families that his hospital shared all information \"relevant to the care of their relatives\". Yet those relatives believe that that promise was not met. They allude to a \"culture of secrecy\" that patient's representatives have long lamented, adding weight to the push for greater openness in the health service. </p> <p>Joyce Robbins, co-director of the campaigning group Patient Concern, claims to hear stories similar to the Oxford case all the time. She cites the frequent complaint that carers are often denied vital information about their patients on account of the Health Records Act and the Data Protection Act. </p> <p>\"I recently met a man whose wife had cancer and he had to look after her at home,\" says Robbins. \"He needed to know when she was going to be discharged, when she needed to go back for check-up and what she needed as medication. But the hospital said they could only supply her - not him - with the information which was no good because she was drugged up to the eyeballs and couldn't remember a thing.\" </p> <p>This is the paradox of patient protection. While the law entitles any person to see information held about them by doctors and health authorities, nobody else can access medical records without the patient's consent. It is a misplaced kindness that backfires the moment a patient is rendered incapable of giving permission. A family member would have to obtain a court order to get access to a relative's most basic medical records. </p> <p>As Robbins notes: \"It is hospitals trying to do the right thing, but it seems a bit ridiculous that, when you've been lying where there's only a curtain between you and the rest of the ward and every stranger in the room can hear, your family is then denied necessary information for your care.\" </p> <p>The row in April over DNR orders being assigned to elderly patients without their knowledge highlighted new concerns over patient and relative consultation. When the health secretary, Alan Milburn, later stepped into the controversy to insist that hospital trusts produce a document stating their policy, he put an end to the illicit practice but not to the qualms that some doctors obviously feel when discussing such matters. </p> <p>Clare Rayner, president of the Patient Association, says: \"Very often doctors don't tell patients news because it's too unpleasant or because they think it might upset them too much and delay their recovery. It is a culture of silence left over from the 50s, when it was considered good, honourable practice not to tell a patient they had cancer.\" </p> <p>Fifty years on, diagnosis concealment is near extinct in the UK. However, what exists in its place is an equally problematic culture of blame that encourages the masking of medical mistakes by health practitioners. Knowing that hospitals are likely to punish and families are keen for recompense, doctors are less likely to admit their errors outside the surgery walls, she argues. </p> <p>Rayner believes that access to more information from the health service will only be given once we accept medicine is not a 100% accurate science. \"Every screening, every operation and every diagnosis is a gamble,\" she says, \"and we must learn to accept that medical help involves an element of risk if we are to get rid of this face of clinical judgement where individual doctors decide what patients can and can't be told.\" </p> <p>The campaign to assert some control over individual medical notes continues to grow. One system that is commonly advocated is a \"living will\" policy, similar to that which exists in America. In order to assure some kind of control over medical notes, this involves patients detailing who they would and would not like to know about their condition, before seeking medical treatment. </p> <p>\"That's something we are telling people to do,\" says Robbins. \"It's a little piece of authorisation that people just don't think of. Some say it's a bit creepy but I think that, if it's part of the medical procedure as it is in the States, it would save a lot of trouble.\" </p> <p>More ambitious is the policy of the Actions for Victims of Medical Accidents group. Chief executive Arnold Simanowitz says the organisation supports a complete change of system in the UK, whereby conscious patients keep their medical records with them. </p> <p>\"There have been a number of experiments in that area and they have all turned out to be very successful,\" he says. \"There is a lot of anxiety on the part of the profession about patients knowing what's going on, but whenever patients have been informed it has always been a good thing. It would also mean that if that patient dies, their information should go to the next of kin.\" </p> <p>Like other patients' campaigning groups, Simanowitz argues that problems nearly always stem from a culture of secrecy. Realising that openness and confidentiality should both be adhered to he suggests health practitioners should start with the premise \"that you've got to be open and have access to your information\" and only diverge from that when it conflicts with issues of confidentiality. </p> <p>\"It would mean a complete system overhaul,\" says Simanowitz, \"but if you start being open and honest from the start, then the patient, the families and the doctors are much more likely to get a fairer ride.\"</p>",
  "<p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> Four years ago Tony Blair promised us a new Britain.<br>He promised taxes wouldn't rise. But they have. <br> He promised shorter waiting lists. But they're longer.<br> He promised smaller classes. But they're larger. <br> He promised more police. But there are fewer. <br> He promised his government would be purer than pure. What a joke.<br> </p> <p> I feel so sorry for the many people who put their hopes in that man. They are so bitterly disappointed. </p> <p> They were sold a dream and it's just not there. And there hasn't been a single word of apology. </p> <p> Well, he did say the Dome hadn't been a runaway success. </p> <p> Not a runaway success? As I recall, that's what people said to me after my defeat in Enfield Southgate. </p> <p> It's four years since I could address a party conference from the platform. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge. We've travelled a long distance since then: I have, you have, the party has. </p> <p> I was devastated by my defeat at the time. It certainly didn't feel like it at the time, but the British electorate did me a favour. My period out of parliament was a chance to connect with the Britain of today. </p> <p> Now, as Shadow Chancellor, I cannot forget those experiences. My job is not just about dry economics. The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. </p> <p> We are the party that understands how much the world has changed. </p> <p> Our country would be stronger and its people more willing to take responsibility if we had fewer politicians passing fewer laws, raising fewer taxes and intruding less in our lives. </p> <p> Young people reject the Labour Party's bossiness, meddling, banning and regulating. </p> <p> Britain has changed and the Conservatives have changed with it. For new generations of British people, old prejudices have been swept away. </p> <p> The Conservative Party is a party for our times. </p> <p> We are a party for people, not against people. We are for all Britons: black Britons, British Asians, white Britons. Britain is a country of rich diversity. That Britain was on display in Sydney. Athletes of every background united by a pride in Britain, and Britain united by its pride in them. Conservatives don't look for uniformity, but for the qualities that mark people out as individual and exceptional. </p> <p> We are for people whatever their sexual orientation. The Conservative Party isn't merely a party of tolerance: it's a party willing to accord every one of our citizens respect. Why should people respect us if we withhold respect from them? </p> <p> We value people for what's inside them. </p> <p> We heard last week Labour's smears against our policy on asylum seekers. That policy will re-establish public confidence in our controls. That frees us to give a warm welcome to those who come to Britain in fear of their lives. </p> <p> That's how my father came. Britain's willingness to take in refugees defines us as a generous and responsible people. It's a tradition that will be upheld by the Conservative Party. </p> <p> We want people to aspire, to reach the heights to which their qualities can lift them. </p> <p> While I was out of parliament I took a television camera into some housing estates. I saw a lot of poverty. But in a way what shocked me was not so much the absolute poverty for many people had videos and their children wore Reebok trainers. What distressed me most was the poverty of expectation and ambition, the lack of hope for anything better in life to come. </p> <p> But in a Saturday school organised by the black community in Sandwell, I found that aspiration: parents determined that their children should have a chance to fulfil their dreams. And education would be the ladder by which they'd climb. </p> <p> Many Labour politicians climbed that ladder. But now they want to kick it away from others. For reasons of pure dogma, they destroy good schools: grant-maintained schools and grammar schools. </p> <p> But they send their own children to exclusive schools. That's Labour's real policy on education. One rule for themselves, another rule for those they govern. </p> <p> William Hague went to a state school. So did Theresa May. So did I. I had excellent teachers. We weren't intimidated by public schools like Mr Blair's. We thought we could do just as well as they did. </p> <p> No state school should ever feel second class. </p> <p> Every parent knows that a school is only as good as its head teacher. The Conservative way is to trust the head teachers and give them the money to spend as they choose. We will give them the opportunity to create great schools, to lift the sights of their pupils, and to transform their young lives. </p> <p> This is our message to parents and teachers: we will set the schools free. </p> <p> The next generation will want to be more independent in their retirement than pensioners are today. We will give them the chance to put their money into a properly-funded pension. We'll enable future generations to accrue prosperity and share fully in the growth of our economy. </p> <p> We won't fudge welfare reform. </p> <p> Gordon Brown promised pensioners change. They got it. Loose change. 75 pence. And when pensioners sent it back in disgust, Gordon cashed the cheques. </p> <p> While I was enjoying my sabbatical, I worked for a few shifts as a hospital porter. I remember once wheeling a patient to the operating theatre on a trolley. He was motionless and I was awfully afraid he might be dead. But without warning, almost like Frankenstein's monster he sat bolt upright and said, \"What on earth are you doing here Mr Portillo?\" </p> <p> I was experiencing the sharp end of the NHS. </p> <p> Everything was in short supply. There weren't enough wheel chairs. So porters had to horde them. It reminded me of stories of the war, when there was rationing, but everyone mucked in and tried to be cheerful. </p> <p> It was impressive. The doctors, nurses and porters are heroes. But things shouldn't have to be like that. </p> <p> Britain spends too little on health. </p> <p> There's a consensus amongst the parties that we should spend much more money on the NHS. But not on how to spend it, nor on how that money can be supplemented. </p> <p> Labour impose politically motivated targets on our doctors and nurses. No wonder they're demoralised. We would give doctors responsibility, and trust them to spend the money wisely, treating the sickest patients first. </p> <p> Where Labour's horizons end, ours begin. </p> <p> Our neighbours in Europe know that you cannot rely on taxes alone to finance health. They would think it silly that families in Britain are encouraged to spend money on their home, on their continued education and on their retirement, but are discouraged through dogma from spending their own money on their health. So other countries have schemes, for instance organised by trade unions and employers. We'll want to encourage that in Britain too. </p> <p> Well spend much more money on the Health Service. And attract extra money too. </p> <p> Labour are stuck in ancient ideology. As Ann Widdecombe once said, Labour have built a Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors. </p> <p> We will tear down that wall. </p> <p> Liberal Democrats have a policy for health and education too. It's is to make doctors and teachers pay more tax. It's not much of a gift for the NHS. But it's a great gift for every Conservative candidate fighting a Liberal Democrat. Let's hear a round of applause for my old pal Charles Kennedy, the Tory candidate's friend. </p> <p> While I was out of Parliament, I became a small business. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise sent me a pile of forms and books and tables that thick. I found it daunting and time-wasting. What a pity Gordon Brown doesn't live in the real world where business people live. </p> <p> We never forget that governments don't create prosperity. Businesses do. </p> <p> Tomorrow David Heathcoat Amory will tell you about our plans to cut red tape. We will make VAT simpler and fairer. Let's stop punishing the people who create the jobs. </p> <p> All Labour Chancellors regulate more. All Labour Chancellors tax more. But Gordon Brown is no socialist hero. He hasn't taxed the rich to give to the poor. He's cynically chosen soft targets for his stealth taxes: hard-working families, people he thought who would never protest. </p> <p> Labour think high taxes give them the moral high ground. They talk of social justice. They believe that money that government spends is always more worthwhile than money that people spend for themselves on their families. </p> <p> But I don't. </p> <p> I believe in allowing hardworking families to keep more of the money they have earned. I believe in allowing them to keep more of their dignity and responsibility. </p> <p> Recently, a man wrote to me, a member of the seamen's union. The union's told him Gordon Brown's taxed the pension fund and he must pay out another \u00a3200 a year if he's not to be worse off in his retirement. </p> <p> Is that social justice? </p> <p> Another man told me he's just retiring. Gordon Brown's abolished the married couple's allowance and age allowance. The man will have to pay \u00a3500 a year more in tax than his brother who retired last year. </p> <p> Is that social justice? </p> <p> In Suffolk last week a mother of four children, a beautician, told me she's been driven out of business by Gordon Brown. She can't afford to fill her tank with the most expensive petrol in Europe. </p> <p> Call that social justice, Mr Brown? </p> <p> There is no social justice in high taxation. </p> <p> The Prime Minister devoted a large part of his Brighton speech to smearing the Conservatives. People long ago stopped believing Mr Blair when he spins his own policies let alone when he falsifies ours. People found his speech not only unbelievable but also disillusioning. Wasn't he meant to bring a new honesty to politics? Why can't he behave like a Prime Minister? </p> <p> Before the election Labour claimed it was no longer addicted to high public spending, that the amount we spend is less important than how well we spend it. They committed themselves to stick to Conservative spending plans, because they knew that our prudence was a foundation of economic stability. </p> <p> But as the events of the last few weeks have shown, this is not a Chancellor whose word is his bond. </p> <p> Our economy has been growing since 1992. That gives us an opportunity to increase public spending. I plan to spend more on public services in every year than Labour has spent in any year. But I don't intend to spend money the country hasn't earned. I will leave room for tax cuts. </p> <p> Labour taxes more and delivers less, and plans higher taxes year after year. Conservatives will tax less, spend better and deliver more. That will be the choice at the next election. </p> <p> We will cut taxes on business, so that they can compete and create prosperity and jobs. </p> <p> We will reform Labour's taxes on entrepreneurs and on inward investment. </p> <p> We will encourage savings, to give people security and self-esteem. </p> <p> We will help pensioners and hard-working families. </p> <p> We will restore a married couple's allowance. </p> <p> We will cut the duty on fuel. </p> <p> That gives you a flavour of my budgets! </p> <p> We will keep an independent Bank of England. We will make it more independent of government and more accountable to Parliament. </p> <p> We will establish a National Accounts Commission to show the world that under the Conservatives there will be no fiddled figures. </p> <p> And we will have an independent committee of economists to give public advice to me on the proper level of surplus or deficit. </p> <p> These measures will ensure honesty, transparency and prudence. </p> <p> They will ensure stable economic policies. They will protect the value of the pound in your pocket. </p> <p> And when I say the pound I mean the pound. For our economic policy will be based on Britain having its own currency and setting its own interest rates. </p> <p> Gordon Brown wants to be the next Chancellor of the Exchequer and he can't tell you whether he wants to control his own currency or not. </p> <p> Labour like to call us little Englanders. Is it likely a little Englander would be called Portillo? I am half Spanish, and proud of it. I am a true European, someone with a love of Europe's different cultures. </p> <p> As the Spanish proverb goes: Antes de que te cases, mira lo que haces. Before you get yourself hitched, watch what you're doing. Look before you leap. </p> <p> The euro plan fails to respect Europe's differences. It shoe horns all the economies of Europe, with their different qualities and cycles and stages of development, into just one currency, and just one interest rate. </p> <p> It threatens to take Europe back to boom and bust. The Irish now have high inflation. But there's nothing they can do about it. When Ireland joined the euro it gave up the right to set its own interest rates. </p> <p> In Germany the economy seems to be faltering. For Germany the single European interest rate is too high. </p> <p> Not surprisingly, one interest rate for all of Europe is wrong for most places most of the time. </p> <p> And here's the rub. Supposing the people of Ireland want to vote against the policies that are driving up their prices? They can't do it. Their elected government doesn't make the policy. The critical political decisions about growth and jobs in Ireland are being taken by the European Central Bank. </p> <p> And who votes for the European Central Bank? No one. It's wholly unaccountable. </p> <p> The most precious thing in Europe is democracy. Mr Blair hoped to bamboozle Britain into joining the euro. He hoped to scare us like children with tales of how frightening it would be to be left out. Denmark has shown that people cannot be fooled or bullied by arrogant politicians. </p> <p> Mr Blair please take note. </p> <p> At the election we will oppose the euro. British public opinion is suspicious of the euro as an unproven piece of political dogma. That is our view. That is the view of the moderate majority. We want to keep the pound. </p> <p> And remember this. The euro is a bright idea recommended by the people who brought us the Dome! </p> <p> Labour is leading Britain in the wrong direction. Compared with the United States we are under-performing. Labour is weighing us down with regulations and taxes. It's making us uncompetitive. It'll throw away our national goal of full employment. </p> <p> Last week Tony Blair talked about Britain in his usual cool Britannia terms. In reality Labour lack confidence in Britain and seem ashamed of it. They are defeatist, thinking there's no future for us unless we are more and more absorbed into Europe, less and less able to make choices for ourselves. </p> <p> It's amazing that the government of the world's fourth largest economy should have given up the game. </p> <p> Conservatives recognise the need for Britain to be globally competitive and produce global companies. If we commit ourselves to maintain control of our own currency and taxes, to be agile and open to change, to cut regulation and make our taxes competitive with the world, we can make Britain the outstanding enterprise centre in Europe. </p> <p> We have a vision that fits our times. </p> <p> William Hague has led this party out of dark days. I have never seen anyone face difficulty with such composure. He has real courage. The courage Britain needs in its next Prime Minister. </p> <p> The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. I will not forget the experiences I had while out of parliament. </p> <p> We will be the party of tax cuts, and welfare reform. Of social justice and full employment. </p> <p> We will use the months ahead to be ready for government, to win the trust of the people that Labour has betrayed. </p> <p> We are a party that believes in Britain, a party for all our people, a party that offers them aspiration and hope. </p> <p> </p>",

Everything from the dress to the best man will be decided by the viewers via a Big Brother-style viewers' poll.</p> <p>Barnaby Dawe, head of brand marketing for Open, said: \"It's all about handing the decision-making over to Open viewers. It will be a fly-on-the-wall documentary with a difference in that it will also be interactive.\"</p> <p>The search for the couple will begin next month with a series of regional heats. The winning pair will be announced on December 30. They will then be followed by the cameras until the wedding on June 2 next year, with viewers voting every week.</p> <p>Reassuringly, viewers will be allowed to choose between three things in each category (dress, honeymoon destination, venue etc), and will not be given complete control. \"The couple won't end up on a honeymoon in Skegness; all the choices will be attractive,\" said Mr Dawe.</p> <p>Mr Dawe said the idea for the show arose from the popularity of Open's weekly polls, in which viewers vote on the major issues of the week. OK! Magazine was an obvious partner because it already has a site on the Open platform.</p>",
  "Long after the 50-plus victims of the last spasm of Middle East violence are cold in their graves, arguments will rage over what provoked the bloodshed. Israelis are reluctant to share the widespread Arab view that the spark which ignited the fire was last week's visit to Jerusalem's most holy mosque complex, the Haram as-Sharif, by the vitriolically rightwing Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon. <p>To Israelis, the Haram as-Sharif is the Temple Mount, the very heart of Judaism. Many believe that Sharon had an absolute right to be there, even though the mosque is off-limits to Jews. Today's Jerusalem Post carries an opinion poll suggesting that only 29% of Israelis believe that Sharon sparked the violence. </p> <p>Most, apparently, prefer to believe the official Israeli explanation for the eruption of violence, that it was largely directed by Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and Gaza strip. There is little if any evidence to support that claim, and in any case it does not explain the ominous spillover of violence into Israel itself. </p> <p>There have been riots and gunbattles inside Israel itself, in Galilee and other districts that are home to a large and highly discontented Arab minority, which accounts for 15% of Israel's 6.2m population. Though prime minister Erhud Barak's government is committed to raising living standards and removing discrimination, the Arab community - nearly a million strong - is visibly Israel's poor relation. </p> <p>The most plausible explanation for the resumption of street fighting is that Sharon's astonishingly provocative act was simply the detonator that set off an already ticking bomb of Arab frustration, both in Israel and the Palestinian territories. </p> <p>It is more than seven years since Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn. It is more than three years since their historic deal was supposed to produce a comprehensive peace settlement. Yet still the region is mired in hatred and recrimination, uncertainty and fear. </p> <p>The 1993 accord, negotiated secretly in Norway, was made possible only because both parties agreed to put the most contentious issues on the back burner. The idea was to establish trust, and then make incremental progress towards lancing the boils on the Middle East body politic. </p> <p>That was not a mistake. Indeed, there is every reason to suppose that if they had attempted a full-scale instant agreement, the enterprise would have foundered at the outset. </p> <p>Nor is it true to say that that the deal remains bogged down in its tentative Oslo form. There has been, by any standard, remarkable progress towards the Holy Grail of a permanent settlement. </p> <p>At their Camp David summit in July, Arafat and Barak came agonisingly close to wrapping up a final package. Three of the four outstanding issues, each of them explosive enough to blow the entire process apart, were effectively settled. </p> <p>Barak was prepared to hand over 90% of the West Bank to the control of Arafat's Palestinian National Authority, and was even reportedly offering to cede pockets of Arab-inhabited territory inside Israel. </p> <p>The knotty issue of Jewish settlements was also tidied up, with Israel retaining sovereignty and security control of small patches of West Bank territory adjoining its own borders. </p> <p>There was even agreement on the huge and festering issue of the Palestinian diaspora: the 6m refugees scattered around the region and beyond, most of them living in squalor. Israel was prepared to allow tens of thousands to return to their ancestral homes, with the rest to be aided by an international fund. </p> <p>That left the biggest, thorniest, and most emotional issue: the future status of Jerusalem, which the Arabs call Al-Quds. </p> <p>For decades, Arafat and the PLO have insisted that their objective is a sovereign Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital. Since 1967, when Israeli troops captured the Old City and the West Bank from Jordan, Israel has been equally adamant that the city will remain forever united, as the capital of the Jewish state. </p> <p>Yet even this apparently unbridgeable chasm has begun to narrow. Arafat's people have started to talk of Islamic, rather than Palestinian, control of the Haram as-Sharif. Ehud Barak, even this week as the fighting raged, was talking to the Jerusalem Post about two capitals, Jerusalem and Al Quds, existing side by side. </p> <p>In the international clamour for both sides to call a halt to the fighting and get back to the negotiating table, both Barak and Arafat are under heavy diplomatic pressure to take the last lunge towards a permanent settlement. It is much more likely, however, that they will do what has become second nature over the past seven angry, bloodsoaked years: stitch together a new interim agreement, and pledge themselves that one day, very soon, they really will get down to resolving the future of Jerusalem. </p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2000/10/02/Features/Features.13098.html\" target=\"_new\">Ehud Barak interview</a><br> <a href=\"http://cgis.jpost.com/cgi-bin/Poll/poller.cgi?pollid=mainp&amp;actn=rslt \" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post opinion poll</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.idf.il/english/news/main.htm\" target=\"_new\">Israel Defence Forces</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.israel.org/gov\" target=\"_new\">Government of Israel</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/demographics.html\" target=\"_new\">Israel's demography</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jrep.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Report</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/index_e.htm\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Information Centre</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.arab.net/palestine/history/pe_plo.html\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Liberation Organisation</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.pna.net\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",
  "<b>Yugoslavia </b> <br> Russian president Vladimir Putin's offer to hold talks in Moscow between the two sides of the Yugoslav standoff makes the front pages. The pro-Kremlin <b>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</b> (Independent Newspaper) says \"Putin's announcement shows that the Kremlin agrees with the conclusions of the Yugoslav electoral commission - that although the opposition candiate Vojislav Kostunica won in the first round, the secound round should nevertheless go ahead, because no candidate won more than 50% of the votes. This position, obviously, goes against everything being said in the Western capitals\". <b>Izvestiya</b>, another pro-government daily, concludes that it is \"extremely unlikely\" that Belgrade will respond positively to Moscow's proposal. <p><b>Putin's visit to India </b><br> Marking the beginning of Putin's first state visit to India, liberal business paper <b>Vedemosti</b> predicts that over the course of the four day trip a series of large-scale arms deals will be announced - continuing Russia's lucrative supply of arms to India, which began in the 1960s and has since then brought Russia some $31 billion income. The Indian government is thought to be particularly interested in purchasing tanks from the Urals. <b>Trud</b> reports that in addition to signing treaties on scientific and technical cooperation and collaboration in the oil and gas industries, Mr Putin is looking forward to receiving an honorary law degree from the Nehru University in Delhi. </p> <p><b>Most Bank sold</b> <br> Vladimir Gusinsky's Most empire - which includes the beleaguered MediaMost television and newspaper holding - received another blow yesterday, according to <b>Vedemosti</b>, when Most Bank (the business which launched Gusinksy as a powerful oligarch) was sold for just $200,000, a mere one rouble per share. In paying such a knockdown price, the buyers - Vneshtorgbank - have agreed to take on some $500 million worth of debts, the paper reports. Although Gusinsky gave up control of the bank several years ago to focus on his media interests, most of the bank's assets are tied up with MediaMost. </p> <p><b>Babitsky in court </b><br> The bizarre story of Andrei Babitsky - the Radio Free Europe journalist whose reporting of the war in Chechnya irritated the Kremlin - returns to the headlines, with the opening of a court case against him. Babitsky was imprisoned as a result of his work and then handed over to Chechen fighters by the Russians, in a still-unexplained prisoner swap, earlier this year. Reporting from the courtroom in Makhachkala in Dagestan, the region neighbouring Chechnya, a <b>Sevodnya</b> correspondent describes Babitsky's defence against the charge of using a false passport when he was picked up by the Russian police - that he was forced to use it and was in a situation where there was no alternative. The case is expected to conclude before the end of the week. </p> <p><b>Olympics</b> <br> Russia's successful performance in the Olympics is analysed in <b>Kommersant</b>, but the paper's sports commentator questions whether, having taken second place behind America, the country's former reputation for sporting excellence has really been restored. Not only did Russia's leading athletics stars fail to win banked-on medals, but the country also lost out in the most prestigious sports, it states. \"To a great extent, the country's improved performance was the result of the expanded range of the Olympic programme.\" In an interview in <b>Izvestiya</b>, Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's Olympic committee, says that Russia could come first in the 2004 games if the Kremlin boosts its support financially and clears up an \"unhealthy confusion\" over which government department should be responsible for Olympic preparation.</p>",
  "<p>The advent of the Personal Television Recorder (PTR) in the UK following last week's launch of TiVo represents a step-change in the control British viewers have over their television entertainment. It is every bit as groundbreaking as the arrival 20 years ago of the VCR. </p> <p>In a digital age of 200-plus channels, it also represents - as Dawn Hayes points out - a ratcheting up of the already overwhelming choice in digital home entertainment. So if PTR is to fulfil its promise and harness digital choice - not by limiting that choice before it reaches the home but by putting a new level of control in the hands of the viewer - it is important to cut through the competing claims to clarify matters.</p> <p>Many myths persist about TiVo. Plenty of commentators still believe it cuts out ads, and a pseudo debate has been stoked up over the supposed implications for advertisers and, indeed, the whole commercial television sector. Except that the facts do not quite fit the arguments. In this regard, TiVo does nothing that early VCRs did not do 20 years ago. Sure, you can fast-forward through ads - up to 60 times normal speed - but that is nothing new. And Charles Allen's nostrum, about the oldest technology for skipping ads being the kettle, has already acquired the status of cliche. </p> <p>Myth two: that BSkyB has snared both TiVo and the Pace/NDS technology in its forthcoming second-generation digibox to prevent other pay-TV networks from offering PTRs to their subscribers, and, or to corner (or \"dominate\", if you prefer) the PTR market in the UK. </p> <p>Again, the facts get in the way. Sky's involvement with TiVo centres on handling sales, marketing and distribution. TiVo is platform-independent. It will work with virtually any TV delivery platform - pay or free-to-air. Indeed, our research shows that interest in TiVo is highest among consumers who do not have access to multi-channel television.</p> <p>And with Sky being the UK pioneer in TV technology over the past 11 years, which company would be better suited to act as midwife to the UK PTR market?</p> <p>From Sky's perspective, much of the commentary on TiVo and the PTR repeats the old mistake of missing what is happening in the real world. The Henley Centre predicts that 75 per cent - well over 15m - homes will have digital TV by 2008. And we have gone on record in projecting 7m Sky digital homes by 2003.</p> <p>So, on any projection, a substantial proportion of UK homes - disproportionately skewed towards younger, more affluent households - will increasingly experience television as a 200-channel phenomenon. The PTR gives them the tool to manage that choice, while leaving the crucial elements of that choice where they belong - in the hands of the viewer. </p> <p>Even on more limited digital platforms, with access to only a couple of dozen channels, the viewer will welcome the powerful sense of control offered by PTR. </p> <p>In this context, TiVo is less a weird, high-priced, prematurely-obsolete gizmo that will send advertisers and broadcasters screaming than a crucial piece of the digital jigsaw.</p> <p>Sky has given PTR a massive vote of confidence. The technology, in whatever form, is not what many are calling it. It is a consumer electronics breakthrough, a genuinely new market, and it will come to be seen as a key to unlock and manage the potential of digital entertainment. </p> <p>Let's get over the hysteria, and move on.</p>",
  "Don Vito Corleone will be turning in his grave. A film about an anti-Mafia hero is playing to enthusiastic audiences in the town synonymous with the Cosa Nostra and with Mario Puzo's fictional godfather who carries its name. <p>\"Only a few years ago this would have been unthinkable,\" said Giuseppe Cipriani, the Left Democrat mayor first elected by the town in 1994 on an anti-Mafia ticket. </p> <p>The movie, Placido Rizzotto (pictured), which will be shown at the London Film Festival in November, celebrates the life of a local trade union figure who led a series of land occupations by the town's poorest peasants. The Mafia took a dim view and in 1948 he was bludgeoned and shot to death by Luciano Liggio (Lucky Luciano), later to emerge as the Cosa Nostra's \"boss of bosses\". </p> <p>A local shepherd boy saw the murder and his resulting agitation was calmed with a lethal injection, administered by one of Corleone's Mafia-linked doctors. </p> <p>Placido Rizzotto had its Sicilian premiere in Corleone last weekend. A packed cinema burst into applause at a scene showing a meeting between Pio La Torre, a leftwing politician who continued Rizzotto's struggle, and a young captain, Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, who arrested the labour leader's killers but failed to get them convicted. In 1982 both men were killed by the Mafia, after playing a key role in Italy's battle against the mob. </p> <p>The enthusiastic response to the picture, made by the Sicilian director Pasquale Scimeca, was a sure sign that the Cosa Nostra is losing its grip. Toto Riina, the Corleone godfather who led the Mafia into head-on confrontation with the state in the early 1990s, has been in prison for almost a decade. There have even been reports of petty crime in the town, another indication that control is slipping from the Mafia's grasp. </p> <p>\"If justice had been more just in those days, we would have made more progress by now,\" the trade unionist's nephew, Placido Rizzotto, told the audience. \"Palermo justice acquitted these people and they came out of it stronger than ever.\" </p> <p>Liggio's acquittal on grounds of insufficient evidence had allowed him and his gang to dominate the hills around Corleone for the following 30 years, Mr Rizzotto said. </p> <p>The Mafia's stranglehold on the area is far from broken, however. Its armed element \"has suffered severe setbacks, but the Mafia devoted to financial activities and the cultivation of politicians is still thriving\", said Maria Maniscalco, another Left Democrat who is mayor of San Giuseppe Jato, a neighbouring agricultural town. In Caccamo, for instance, the wife of a fugitive Mafia boss was until recently the elected town councillor overseeing public works contracts. </p> <p>Today's boss of all bosses is Bernardo Provenzano, also a Corleonese, who has eluded police for the last 37 years, even though the police believe he has stayed in the area. </p> <p>Giuseppe Lumia of the Left Democrats - the first Sicilian to head the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission - said the Mafia still had enormous capacity to frighten people, yet public support would be crucial if the state was to win the battle. </p> <p>\"The novelty in Corleone is that now the anti-Mafia is in the majority,\" he said. He cited the confiscation there of a luxurious villa owned by Riina. It was recently turned into a school for agricultural studies.</p>",

Crudup, who has received much critical acclaim for his role as a rock journalist in the forthcoming Almost Famous (released here at the end of the year), will play a second world war British air force pilot shot down over France. Blanchett will play his girlfriend Charlotte, who goes in search of him. Oscar and Lucinda director Gillian Armstrong will direct and shooting begins in February. </p> <p>\u0095 The increasingly sombre <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Craven,+Wes\">Wes Craven</a> has signed up to direct Drowning Ruth, a thriller based on the novel by Christina Schwartz. The story is based on a family living in rural America in 1919 and centres around two sisters and the mystery which surrounds one of their deaths. This will not be his next project though; The Nightmare on Elm Street creator will first work on an adaptation of his novel Fountain Society, which tells the story of a scientist who is given the opportunity to cure his cancer through a experimental cloning procedure. </p> <p>\u0095 James Cameron is planning a trip into space, according to <a href=\"http://www.ananova.com\">Ananova</a>.

Hawn would play a tough waitress still yearning for her wild past, while Sarandon would play a primmer character who would rather forget it all happened. </p>",
  "<p>Maximus. Now, there's a man for you. Gladiator's lead is all scorching, testosterone-fuelled death wish, tinged with enduring passion for his lady. Butch incarnate, he's the Jude Law backlash, the long overdue response to Angst Boy and Moisturiser Man with all his tiresome, over-analytical ways. </p> <p>Maximus isn't in touch with the intricacies of his sexuality. He doesn't need therapy. He couldn't interior design his way out of a Tuscan farmhouse. He doesn't cry. Or clean. And boy, can he make a leather skirt twirl! No surprise, then, that he has now hit the number one spot in Empire magazine's sexiest film character of all time poll. </p> <p>Except, of course, it is surprising. Partly because Russell Crowe, Maximus' real-life alter ego, is distinctly unattractive in a squidgy, shapeless-faced kind of way (don't argue - he is) but also precisely because of the unreconstructed mindless man trip he indulges. The leaden, overly worked-out body shape. The brutal war instinct. The tendency to ditch his family for months at a time so he might rape and pillage elsewhere. The disregard for personal hygiene. </p> <p>Read on down the poll and you will notice this regressive trend in movie sex icons evolving further. Princess Leia is number two, but only in her Return of the Jedi incarnation, because she wore a gold bikini top for most of the action. The poll is very clear on that point. Harrison Ford in macho, sweat-stained, wench-rescuing Indiana Jones guise makes it to number four. Jane Fonda's catsuit-clad Barbarella swings in at number six and apparently the appeal of that particular character is so enduring that a new version of the film, starring Drew Barrymore, goes into production as we speak. And so it goes on. </p> <p>Who'd have thought it, eh? Behind all our pretty talk of gender issues and a second poll released yesterday which predicts that by 2015, all housework chores will be shared equally between the sexes, we are yearning for a revival of these two-dimensional cartoony versions of prototype manliness and girliness. </p> <p>The closer the sexes get in real life, the more homogeneous we become in terms of role fulfilment, the more we lust after Maximus men and Barbarella totty in our multiplexes. One of the greatest taboos of the post-feminist era is that, for many of us, our fantasy realm is unreservedly un-PC. The buffer of fiction gives us scope to indulge a warped wonderland around which Maximus and his like can roam unchecked, but which bears no relation to the things to which women aspire in the cold, hard light of real life. </p> <p>None of which gets us over the basic issue of Maximus' face. Nothing can excuse the gratuitous fancying of something so plain. And did nobody else who watched the film notice the damaged, corrupt beauty of evil Commodus Joaquin Phoenix, lurking behind pillars and skulking round battle tent corners? Really?</p>",
  "<p>Jane is 27 years old. She has a three-year-old son, and she is afraid. \"I bet they're looking up, laughing at me. He said he wanted me dead, and he's getting closer. I just don't get it.\" </p> <p>Tonight she is looking at east London from the landing outside her sixth-floor council flat. It's a clear, crisp evening and in an absent moment she describes the wonderful view of the Millennium Dome and the London Eye from her window. </p> <p>Then she turns to look at her front door, which is charred black and slightly ajar. She screws up her face at the smell of burnt plaster and carpet. </p> <p>Her possessions and those of her son have been destroyed by a fire which started four hours earlier. They were out when the blaze began. They will never live here again. Below, a group of youths are milling in the street. In the dim light it is difficult to pick out faces, but Jane suspects her ex-boyfriend is among them. She pulls up her sleeve and shows a scar from a knife wound: \"He did that.\" </p> <p>And the reason she gives for this venomous campaign? \"We had a row at a friend's house. I threw my mobile at him. He lost it. He's a nutter.\" </p> <p>DC Euan McKeeve and PC Jackie Howe, from Newham's community safety unit - which investigates domestic violence - listen to the tale. They are not surprised when Jane says she is reluctant to give a statement. It's 7.30pm. They could be here for a while. </p> <p> <strong> Reluctant</strong> </p> <p> Detective Sergeant Sharon Stratton seems embarrassed. Plaistow police station is busy rather than frantic - only four of the nine officers are in this morning - and the overnight list is pretty thin. Nine reports of domestic violence and nobody in the cells. </p> <p>\"It's not usually this quiet,\" she says. \"Just our bloody luck.\" Stratton does not usually wish for work. But today is significant - a \"national snapshot\" of domestic violence is being undertaken. </p> <p>Details of every incident are being gathered ahead of a two- day international conference, Enough is Enough!, to be held at the end of the month, which is being organised by the Metropolitan police. The home secretary Jack Straw, the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens and Betsy Stanko, director of the Violence Research programme at the University of London, will be among speakers trying to reposition domestic violence at the top of a cluttered crime agenda. </p> <p>Victims, police and policymakers have not always regarded domestic violence as \"real\" crime, but attitudes are changing. They must. The latest figures are horrifying. Every three days a woman is killed in a \"domestic\". Last year, more than 77,000 violent incidents were reported in London alone - one every six minutes. </p> <p>A quarter of all reported violent crime is domestic. Half of the women murdered last year were killed in fights with their husbands, and on average a woman will be assaulted 35 times, and nearly always in front of her children, before she has the courage to ring the police. </p> <p>The cost of helping the victims of domestic violence is estimated at \u00a32bn a year. Stratton's team is in the frontline. Her CSU, which was set up 18 months ago in a reorganisation resulting from the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, investigated 519 incidents in July, more than any other borough in the capital. </p> <p>There are West Indian, Asian, African and east European communities in the area, diversity that makes the job more challenging. Officers are loath to stereotype, but in their experience, Asian women are the most reluctant to come forward. One local victim suffered 40 years of abuse before dialling 999. Some Turkish men have been astonished the police regard wife-beating as a crime. </p> <p>Although it is quietish this morning, it gives the officers a chance to talk. Cases they describe as \"typical\" are nothing less than shocking. PC Maria Neeves has called a 29-year-old victim to ask for the return of the panic alarm in her flat. There is a shortage and Neeves needs to give it to someone else. </p> <p>The woman, Alison Smith, is having counselling and would prefer to keep the alarm. But she accepts she is no longer a priority because Peter, her ex-boyfriend, is now in jail. </p> <p>\"I broke off with Peter because I discovered he was seeing another woman,\" she says. \"Even though he had another girlfriend, he couldn't take it. He wanted to get back with me, but there was no way. The trust had gone.\" </p> <p>For the next six months Alison and her mother received anonymous and threatening phone calls. Alison thought she was being stalked. She wondered what lengths Peter might go to. On May 10, she found out. </p> <p> <strong> Attack</strong> </p> <p> The night before, he broke into the empty flat next door to Alison's in Forest Gate. Wearing a balaclava and combat gear, he waited. \"The next morning I opened the door into the hallway to pick up my post. He grabbed me and pushed me back inside. </p> <p>\"First, he stabbed me above the right eye. He used a stun gun on me six times and coshed me over the head. He taped up my eyes and mouth, threw me on the sofa and punched me all over and beat my face. </p> <p>\"He told me if I kept quiet he would kill me quickly, otherwise he would torture me long and slow.\" Fortunately, a neighbour heard the commotion and called the police. Officers found a petrol can in the flat next door but could not link it to Peter. </p> <p>\"I think he was planning to kill me then torch the flat,\" Alison says. Peter pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and was jailed in August for three years. \"With good behaviour, he will be out this time next year,\" says Alison. \"I can't believe that's all he's got. I'm thinking of leaving the country.\" </p> <p>Stratton's team regard the conviction as a success because prosecutions are hard to come by. Getting victims to make statements is difficult enough. Getting them to stick to their statements and give evidence in court can be tortuous. </p> <p>It is common for victims to make \"withdrawal statements\" on the eve of trials. Neeves is still getting over the frustration of a case involving a mother who was being abused by an ex-boyfriend, the father of their nine-month-old girl. </p> <p>The man tried to batter his way into her house with a piece of wood and said he would kill her if she dared leave. She did, but he followed her to work. </p> <p>When she left at the end of the day, he ran down the road hammering on the side of her car, terrifying her baby and eight-year-old son. who were with her. That evening, he returned to her house and battered the door again. Then, he smashed every window of her car. She called the police at 9.40pm, saying \"a man was going mad\", and he fled. </p> <p>As officers took down the details, he rang the house on his mobile phone and told one of them: \"I'm going to get someone to blow her kneecaps off and throw acid in her face. I'm going to kill her family ... you know fuck all, fuck off.\" When he was arrested, his explanation was, \"I get angry.\" </p> <p>The case was dropped when the victim agreed to an out-of-court settlement from his family for the damage to her car. \"It's easy to put pressure on a woman, especially if children are involved,\" says Neeves. \"It takes a lot of courage to come forward, especially if your partner is apologising and saying it will never happen again. In most cases, it always does. We know some women who are bound to end up dead.\" </p> <p>Abuse of men by women is extremely rare. Claims of such attacks are almost always made as discrediting counter-allegations. Stratton is dealing with one case involving a pensioner, but again, it seems unlikely it will come to court. </p> <p>The 65-year-old victim owns a three-storey house in Forest Gate. When his son married, the newlyweds moved in. The son died 17 years ago, the daughter-in-law stayed and remarried. The victim alleges he was banished to the top of the house and treated like a slave. </p> <p>\"They sent him out to the shops and if he came back without the right things, they would beat him,\" says Stratton. </p> <p>\"The neighbours saw his injuries but he was too afraid to come forward and they said nothing. He suffered this for more than 10 years.\" </p> <p>The man's relatives deny assaulting him. The victim is terrified and his resolve is weakening. Does he have the strength to go to court? \"Probably not,\" says Stratton. \"I'm not sure he can go through with it. He wants to withdraw.\" </p> <p> <strong> Advice</strong> </p> <p> Pek Choo is a social worker assigned to Newham's CSU. She's been working in the field for 17 years, advising women where to get help and whether to pursue their abusers through the civil or criminal court. </p> <p>Newham is a poor area, but she says it is ignorant to assume domestic violence thrives in poverty. \"Actresses, dancers, bankers, I've seen them all. With the middle and upper classes, it's just more hidden.\" </p> <p>One of her clients was a woman whose husband worked in the City. She was also highly successful and independently wealthy. \"One evening a week, he gave the servants the night off and ordered his wife to make a meal. Once it was prepared, he would take the plate and throw the food down the stairs, crushing it into the carpet. </p> <p>\"Then he would make her clear up the mess.\" On one occasion when she protested, he smashed her head against the wall. \"Domestic violence is not always physical,\" says Choo. \"It is almost always about control.\" </p> <p> <strong> Arson</strong> </p> <p> The 999 call for the council flat fire came at 4pm. It was classified as an 'I' incident - immediate response - but there were no uniformed officers available. Suspecting it might be their territory, DC McKeeve and PC Howe decide to check it out rather than wait for a report. </p> <p>Within minutes of arriving at 6.45pm, their hunch proved right. Jane's ex-boyfriend was seen in the block carrying a brick shortly before the fire. A brick lies by a smashed pane of glass next to the front door. </p> <p>The fire brigade believes it was arson, started by someone setting light to the sofa. The scenes of crime officer has arrived to take prints of a footmark and samples of smashed glass - it might be possible to match tiny fragments on the culprit's clothes. </p> <p>At 9.07pm, the flat is boarded up with corrugated iron sheets. Jane is wondering where she will stay. She has decided to give a statement but does not doubt this will put her in more danger. \"He told a mate of mine that I'd be dead the next time she saw me. There are times when I think I might as well kill myself.\" </p> <p> Refuge 24-hour helpline 0870 599 5443. The names of the victims have been changed.</p>",

  "<p>French media and utilities group Vivendi's efforts to woo the international investment community were boosted yesterday by sharply higher earnings and plans to revamp its corporate governance structures. </p> <p>Jean-Marie Messier, the chairman, said the group was looking to scrap a series of measures which limit shareholders' voting rights. </p> <p>\"I believe all the measures, taken together, make for an ambitious corporate governance package,\" Mr Messier said yesterday. </p> <p>The company has held a series of investor road shows, ahead of its planned $34bn acquisition of Seagram of Canada, at which American shareholders are understood to have voiced concerns about Vivendi's existing corporate governance practices. </p> <p>\"It [the package] shows we are listening to investors,\" Mr Messier said. </p> <p>The proposals include scrapping double voting which gave some shareholders more rights than others, linked to the length of time they had held their shares. </p> <p>They also end the board's right to issue large amounts of new shares - without consulting shareholders - in the event of a takeover bid. Mr Messier said the company planned to post voting forms on its website as soon as French law allowed for the change. </p> <p>Restrictions which link the numbers of shares of investors who hold stakes of more than 2% to the overall number of shares being voted look likely to stay for at least the time being, with Mr Messier arguing that the curb will become decreasingly important as Vivendi increases the number of shareholders taking part in annual meetings from the current 30% or so. </p> <p>Vivendi's strategy is expected to put pressure on other French companies to bring their corporate governance more closely into line with international best practice. </p> <p>Corporate France has already taken a number of steps, including unwinding cross shareholdings and, under pressure from the government, publishing the pay of top executives. </p> <p>As well as its reform of shareholder voting rights Vivendi revealed that net attributable profits rose to \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a3840m) in the first half of the year - up from \u20ac847m in the same period last time. </p> <p>The figures, which included a \u20ac380m after-tax profit on the sale of assets, were quoted on a pro-forma basis because of accounting changes at Cegetel, its telecoms business, and the effect of converting the results to an average foreign exchange rate for the period. </p> <p>The group - which in Britain takes in the rail companies Connex South East and Connex South Central and water companies including Three Valleys - said that it expected second-half performance either to match or beat that of the first half. </p> <p>First-half sales rose to \u20ac19.4bn with the main surge coming from the communications and environment business. The internet business was \u20ac72m in the red at the operating level but Vivendi said the loss was within budget. </p> <p>Debt at the end of the first half amounted to \u20ac21.7bn but that figure would have been \u20ac14.5bn if the proceeds from the recent flotation of Vivendi Environment and other asset sales since the end of the period were taken into account. </p> <p>Vivendi shares ended the day up \u20ac1.70 at \u20ac85.90 on the Paris Bourse.</p>",
  "Some 11 years ago, a woman called Lori Griffin checked herself into a hospital in Charleston, South Carolina, complaining of premature labour pains. Instead of receiving treatment she was handcuffed and shackled, put in a wheelchair and whisked off to jail. Her urine had tested positive for cocaine and she was charged with passing drugs to a minor - her unborn child. <p>On Wednesday the case will arrive at the US Supreme Court, which will consider whether the hospital had the right to test Griffin, and nine other plaintiffs, without their consent. On the face of it, it is a matter of privacy and the authorities' right to conduct searches on suspicion of a crime.</p> <p>But it is about much more than that. It is a case that straddles the fault lines in US society because it pits the rights of women against the rights of their unborn children. There are other issues in this election year which will decide more votes, but none that will arouse deeper emotions. If the Supreme Court rules on the side of the unborn child, the road may be paved towards a reversal of Roe v. Wade, the landmark case guaranteeing women the right to an abortion.</p> <p>In the late 1980's, the hospital administrators in South Carolina were facing a tide of crack addiction. Robert Hood, a South Carolina lawyer involved in the hospital cases said there were: \"Pathetic situations, where the babies were born dead, mothers had abrupted placentas and almost died. And there weren't one or two of them, there were hundreds of them. It was going on all over the United States. And, in fact, in '89, it was an epidemic.\"</p> <p>So the doctors and nurses began to carry out surreptitious urine tests on high-risk maternity patients. At first, women who tested positive were simply arrested. Later on, in 1990, they were offered the choice of treatment or arrest, but women's rights campaigners say forcing women into treatment is no way of curing them of addiction. Furthermore, basic constitutional rights to privacy, which prevent the government from carrying out illegal searches, are at stake.</p> <p>Susan Dunn, the women's lawyer argued: \"It's un-American. It is an abuse of power. It is coercion and control. It is turning a health-care practitioner who is there to build a healthy alliance with their patient for health, and turning that person essentially into a tool of the state, who's in a position to say, 'You do what I want you to do or I'm going to have you arrested.'\"</p> <p>The lawyers on the other side of the case argue that the woman's right to privacy cannot entirely outweigh the basic rights of the child, and as these cases where the pregnancy had entered its last three months, the foetus was a fully fledged child before the law.</p> <p>\"It can't be an unreasonable search and seizure when the government interest is so profound to protect maternal health, to protect the health of the unborn child, when the magnitude of the invasion is so small, because you're already in a medical setting,\" said Doug Kmiec, a constitutional lawyer from the conservative Pepperdine University.</p> <p>The case is not only a proxi for the ongoing conflict over abortion. It is also tinged with race. The decision to test for crack cocaine inevitably targeted black women, because crack is the cheap, highly addictive drug of the urban ghettoes. Civil rights advocates argue it would make more sense to test for alcohol or tobacco, which are more widespread and can be as damaging to the foetus. </p> <p>The simple reason, say South Carolina's supporters, is that alcohol and tobacco are not illegal, so it would be impossible to gain court backing to search for traces of them.</p> <p>Whoever wins the case, it will be a sharp reminder that Supreme Court has become the arena for some of the most visceral debates in US society, and it's make-up is therefore highly-politicised. At the moment there is a 5-4 conservative majority on the bench, but with retirements looming, the next president will probably be able to choose up to three Supreme Court judges. It is one of the great prizes of this election.</p>",
  "The British government was last night claiming victory in helping to frame a European Union charter of rights that does not grant any new rights or extend the authority of the union. <p>Lord Goldsmith, Tony Blair's representative on the committee drafting the document, said he would recommend it be adopted as a non-binding declaration at the Nice summit in December. It was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry but attacked by the Conservatives. </p> <p>The charter of fundamental rights of the European Union, published coincidentally and confusingly just as Britain's Human Rights Act came into force, is designed to define what the EU - not individual governments - can or cannot do. </p> <p>The idea was to make existing rights more visible to EU citizens and to give a moral dimension to a body which has never given prominence to human rights. Britain resisted attempts to add any new ones, or to undermine the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>\"We welcome the final text of the charter,\" Downing Street said. \"It reflects the range of rights enjoyed by European citizens and is fully compatible with the European convention. On social and economic issues the charter sets out principles from national and European legislation but does not assert new legal rights.\" </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith, a barrister, succeeded in qualifying references to the right to take strike action by referring back to national laws and practices. The same qualification was applied to article 30, guaranteeing protection against unjustified dismissal. In British law that exists only after a year's employment. </p> <p>British intervention also managed to alter a draft reference to the need for workers' consultation. The original phrase \"at all levels\" finally became \"appropriate levels\", reflecting concerns from business that trade unions might be given a management role. </p> <p>Article 16 of the charter recognises the freedom to conduct a business. The 53-point document itself states explicitly: \"This charter does not establish any new power or task for the community or the union, or modify powers and tasks defined by the treaties.\" </p> <p>It will now be sent to the EU's 15 heads of government, including Mr Blair, who meet at the Biarritz summit in a fortnight before they formally adopt the charter at Nice. </p> <p>British officials say they will resist any attempts to unpick the text or to shift the charter to anything more binding. France and Germany have been pressing for the charter to be incorporated into the Nice treaty. </p> <p>The draft won immediate endorsement from the CBI, which had opposed earlier versions on the grounds it would impose new costs on business and undermine Britain's competitive advantages. </p> <p>\"Nobody should pretend that this draft is perfect, but the government has fought hard for business and come up with a result we can live with,\" said Susan Anderson, director of human resources. \"There will be no shift in the balance of power between the EU and member states.\" </p> <p>Giampiero Alhadeff, secretary general of Solidar, an umbrella group of unions, said: \"This is just the kind of Europe people want, a Europe of rights and responsibilities. We did not get all we wanted, but this is a great beginning.\" </p> <p>Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the prime minister of having sold out British interests. \"This job- destroying charter should have been vetoed at the outset, as Conservatives demanded. Everyone throughout the EU - except Labour - now admits that the charter is very likely to grow into a legally binding treaty. The charter's rights to strike threaten to roll back 20 years of Tory reforms.\" </p> <p><b> Rights charter</b> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095Right to life </p> <p>\u0095Respect for private and family life </p> <p>\u0095Protection of personal data </p> <p>\u0095Right to education </p> <p>\u0095Freedom to conduct a business </p> <p>\u0095Equality between men and women </p> <p>\u0095Fair and just working conditions </p> <p>\u0095Right of collective bargaining and action </p> <p>\u0095Access to EU documents </p> <p>\u0095Rights of elderly to life of dignity</p>",

  "Lady Plowden, who has died aged 90, enjoyed her highest public profile during the years in which she chaired the Independent Broadcasting Authority, between 1975 and 1980. But her most seminal influence on British life was in the 1960s, as chairman of a national committee on primary education, which endorsed and symbolised a progressive educational philosophy. <p>At the time, the Guardian described her committee's report as \"thorough, humane and liberal\", and it was praised - even by harsh critics - as a real advance on what had gone before. Yet a generation later, so-called \"Plowdenism\" in education was widely vilified by people who had never read a word of the report - and who certainly ignored what should have been its most potent message: that Britain continues, at its peril, to accept high rates of school failure. </p> <p>Plowden's public life also coincided with a crucial phase in the history of that peculiarly British institution, the \"great and the good\", the caste which, for more than a century, had chaired national bodies and peopled, in a relatively non-partisan way, the commissions dedicated to social reform. She shared her caste's tribulations too, scarred by Thatcher hostility to consensual politics. </p> <p>It was not until she was in her 50s that Bridget Plowden became a national figure. But public service was in her bones. She would talk about \"getting things done\", with the implication that it was the obvious course of action if you were in the right place at the right time. And she was. </p> <p>She was the daughter of an admiral, naval historian and master of Downing College, Cambridge (who gave her Horatia as a middle name). Her husband was the life peer, Edwin Plowden, one of the most eminent civil servants of his day, and himself the chairman of a number of important public policy committees. Her son William, UK director of the Atlantic fellowships, set out early on much the same path. </p> <p>Because of her father's profession, Plowden was educated at a variety of schools and by governesses in England and Ceylon. She did not take up a profession while her four children were growing up. \"I wanted to cherish them,\" she would say. </p> <p>It was voluntary committee work that revealed her talents. In 1962, a family friend, Geoffrey Crowther, got her on the board of the hotel and caterering group, Trust House Forte. She was then 52. In 1963, so the story goes, she was seated at an official dinner next to Sir Edward Boyle, the most liberal and intelligent Conservative education minister since RA Butler. Impressed by Plowden's judgment and charm, Boyle insisted she drop her duties as a London juvenile magistrate, and her charities, to chair the Central Advisory Council on Education. </p> <p>It was a major test for any chairman. The council's wide-ranging function was \"to consider primary education in all its aspects\". The members included stars of the profession and several intellectual big shots, among them AJ Ayer, Michael Young, author of The Rise Of The Meritocracy, and the Conservative MP Timothy Raison, then editor of New Society. It was Plowden's achievement to obtain a report from them, which broke so much new ground. </p> <p>The report, published in 1967 and entitled Children And Their Primary Schools, has gone down in history as justifying a swing against rote learning in primary education, in favour of \"learning readiness\". But its real message was, of course, far more nuanced. Indeed, its curricular recommendations look like today's national curriculum. </p> <p>It was also the first of the major education reports to give a place to parents, another theme of our times. It favoured systematic nursery education and denounced the cane. In addition, the committee argued strongly for favouring schools in socially deprived areas with extra staff and funds. This was a perfect example of old-style governance. </p> <p>The idea had been fed to the committee by those who knew about American models. But it was Plowright's reaction which swung her colleagues. Her associates remember her coming to committee enthusiastic and purposeful. But then, one always imagined her being both popular and effective in a school team. She wanted to say she had been inspired by informal primary schools in the mining villages of the West Riding. Despite all the odds, children really wanted to learn. Shouldn't the committee look at this? </p> <p>Plowden had known the Department of Education and Science would try to block her committee's ambitions. But \"Biddy\", as the DES called her, went on fighting for children in areas \"buffeted\" by failure and \"forces outside their control\" - like unemployment and poor housing - who had a right to the best kind of schooling. As she put it in 1972: \"Much of the misunderstanding and violence in society . . . comes from a deep feeling of isolation and injustice ingrained in our city failures and within our education system.\" </p> <p>She also argued that national interest was at stake. Not to act would be to accept \"that we will follow the American pattern, and the problems will have outstripped our capacity to deal with them\". </p> <p>But however enthused by effective professionals, and believing in a consensual interest in reform, the liberal elite had forgotten one basic rule - that public bodies forget public opinion at their peril. Reasoned critiques of the Plowden report, like a famous book from the London University Institute of Education, were brushed aside by a new right, in the form of the education black papers, edited by Professor Brian Cox, of Manchester University. A hardening left offered no support; it simply saw Plowden as the mother of two Etonians. </p> <p>The problems were not obvious immediately. Indeed, initially, the Plowden report was widely cheered. Christopher Chataway, Conservative leader of the Inner London Education Authority, co-opted her to help London primary schools \"go Plowden\". In 1970, she became vice-chairman of the BBC governors, where her \"plain speak-inc\" caused some surprise but added to her committee reputation. At the end of her BBC term, she was made chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority. </p> <p>This was not a job in which people of goodwill worked together with more or less common goals. Here, the only unity of view was that they did not want an interventionist chairman, let alone an \"educator\" and an \"amateur\". </p> <p>But while Plowden eventually won respect for what turned out to be a reasoned and minimally interventionist approach, she did perhaps sign the death knell for the \"great and the good\" being allowed to award franchises on a kind of Oxford viva system. It was the disaster of TV-am going to the establishment scion, Peter Jay, that was to lead to the introduction of the bids system by competing television companies. </p> <p> Some monstrously partisan attacks were made on Bridget Plowden in her old age, amplified by the popular press. Yet she continued to encourage teachers and others dedicated to fighting educational failure, and she never abandoned the values of public service. </p> <p>In her 80s, she was still president of an under-5s charity she had invented, called VOLCUF, of the Council for Gypsy and Travellers' Children, of the College of Preceptors, and of the volunteer reading help programme in schools, in which volunteers helped schoolchildren by reading with them. Plowden also told off John Major's government for decimating the HM inspectorate of schools, \"the independent conscience for education\". We must hope that she will now be properly honoured. </p> <p>Plowden is survived by her husband, a daughter and two sons. A second daughter pre-deceased her. </p> <p> \u0095 Bridget Horatia Plowden, educational reformer, born May 5 1910; died September 29 2000</p>",
  "<p> A mid the clamour of last week's campaign to persuade parents to \"try out\" the internet at their child's school - complete with laborious point-and-click demonstrations - one initiative lies buried. You are not lilely to find them on the official Parents Online Week site (<a href=\"http://www.parentsonline.gov.uk\">www.parentsonline.gov.uk</a>), but the Safety Tips for Children (<a href=\"http://www.iwf.org.uk/safe/children.htm\">www.iwf.org.uk/safe/children.htm</a>) do represent a real step forward. </p> <p>Internet Watch Foundation's chairman Mike Kerr, compares the five guidelines to the Green Cross Code. He worries that safety issues were overlooked in the rush to publicise Parents Online. Certainly the grotesque figure of a buxom Web Auntie, who purports to answer parents' questions but lacks an email address herself, is a very poor substitute for intelligent advice which could be given about children's use of the web. </p> <p>Parents, a recent Readers' Digest survey revealed, are at the same time trusting (75%) in their children's ability to use the web \"sensibly\" and suspicious (49%) that they will find violent or sexually explicit sites. Chief among their fears - thanks, no doubt, to the News of the World's recent campaign - is the presence of paedophiles on the web. Kerr drew my attention to a recent case in which a Milton Keynes mother accompanied her daughter to meet a friend she had met on the web. He turned out to be a 47-year-old man. Sarah's Law, Kerr points out, will be no protection against such incidents. </p> <p>Knowing your enemy and daubing a slogan on his door is, of course, a lot easier than finding the words to explain the possible dangers of the web to a small child, and the News of the World has not published his advice. The IWF has done well to transpose the \"stranger-danger\" messages with which children are likely to be familiar into an online setting. \"Don't talk to strangers,\" for example, becomes \"Remember that other people may not be what they seem, so don't take them at face value ... never agree to go off into a private chat room with anyone. It's much safer to stay in public areas with other people around.\" </p> <p>Central to the safety tips is the advice never to give out your name or address online. Around a third of children are prepared to do this in exchange for gifts or information. </p> <p>Parents Online, meanwhile, should help absolute novices. The Journeys section at: <a href=\"http://www.parentsonline.gov.uk/journeys\">www.parentsonline.gov.uk/journeys</a> is worth a look if you have a small child, and there are a number of alluring competitions to enter. </p>",
  "<p>Do you feel safer today? Yesterday, laws were passed in the UK that will force any organisation making decisions about our lives to take our rights into account before they act. </p> <p>For the very first time, the basic freedoms every citizen is entitled to expect have been written in legislation called the Human Rights Act. </p> <p> <strong> What are these human rights and where do they come from?</strong><br> </p> <p> There are 12 main parts or \"Articles\" to the act plus some additional rules in something called a Protocol. Some Articles promise us freedom from torture or slavery while others underline our right to such things as a fair trial, family life, and our beliefs. Protocol 1 describes our rights to possessions and education. </p> <p>The Articles are based on those found in the European Convention on Human Rights. These were passed in 1949 in the hope that they would prevent a repeat of the crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War. So far, 41 countries have signed the convention as part of their membership of the Council of Europe. Many of those are well ahead of Britain by having already added the convention's rules to their own laws. </p> <p> <strong> So, is this the first time rights have been laid down in British law?</strong> <br> </p> <p> No. There was the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Bill of Rights in 1689. These were forced on the kings of the day by the most powerful men in the country who hoped to limit their royal powers. What makes the Human Rights Act different is that it applies to everyone. </p> <p>To complicate the situation, British citizens have been able to challenge laws which they feel ignore their basic freedoms. After failing to get justice in UK courts, people have been able to take their problems to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. But this has always been a very expensive and long process. The new Act will make going to Strasbourg unnecessary - although the possibility still exists. </p> <p> <strong> In what way is the Human Rights Act different from other laws?</strong> <br></p> <p> The British people have always been protected by laws, but these have usually covered specific matter and have not laid down any general principles. One way of understanding the difference is to think of a game. So far our legal system has been like the rules of the game telling us exactly what to do. The Act opens things out. Now it's as if the game rules include bigger promises such as the guarantee that we will get time to play and have fun when we do so. </p> <p> <strong> Is everyone in favour of the Human Rights Act?</strong><br> </p> <p> Critics are worried that it will create more problems than it solves because some rights it guarantees are so general. Certain Articles also seem to be in conflict. Where does a newspaper's right of expression stop and the right of someone's privacy begin? </p> <p>Some fear it gives too much power to judges who, although not elected, will be able to challenge the laws passed by elected governments. Others fear that lawyers will bring all sorts of \"inappropriate\" cases on behalf of troublemakers or lawbreakers hoping to escape justice. </p> <p>Its supporters say that adopting the European Convention on Human Rights has not brought chaos to other European countries. </p> <p> <strong> How will the Act affect young people?</strong><br> </p> <p> It could touch on everything. For example, Article 2 (the Right to Life) may allow your parents to challenge your health authority if it refuses you treatment for some reason. </p> <p>Headteachers and governors may also face challenges. They will have to be careful that punishments do not break Article 3 which protects people from degrading treatment. The right of freedom of expression (Article 10) could be used, as in a recent case, to defend someone excluded for setting up a controversial website critical of their school. The right to a fair hearing (Article 6) could also affect pupils facing exclusion. And just last week there was the case of Rachel Warden. Her father plans to use the Act to find out why an admissions panel would not support his claim that Rachel failed her 11-plus exam because of a health problem. </p> <p> <strong> Is it enough to have rights?</strong><br> </p> <p> Rights are one thing but they need to be balanced by a sense of one's responsibilities, and an understanding of how one person's freedoms can undermine those of others. </p> <p> <strong> More information: </strong> The Children's Legal Centre's advice line is: 01206 873820</p> <p> The Citizenship Foundation publishes a free booklet Human Rights Impact (tel: 020 7929 3344) and offers teaching resources on-line at: <a href=\"http://www.citfou.org.uk\">www.citfou.org.uk </a></p> <p> The charity Legal Action Group has devoted the September edition of Legal Action to the Human Rights Act (tel: 020 7837 6094) <br> </p> <p> <strong> Curriculum links: citizenship, key stages 3 &amp; 4.</strong></p> <p>\u0095 My thanks to Carolyn Hamilton of the Children's Legal Centre</p>",

  "<p>Jackie Utting had just dropped her eldest son at Leicester University for the start of his first term. Hailstones battered 18-year-old Robert's duvet as they ran from the car. His face fell when he realised he'd forgotten to pack his radio. Not to worry, his mother would drive it one and half hours from Lowestoft, Suffolk, next weekend. She felt terrible leaving him there in the pouring rain. </p> <p>\"I feel dreadful, but not as bad as I thought I would. And not as bad as his dog, who has been very depressed all week. The full force of it will hit me at work tomorrow.\" </p> <p>Jackie Utting clutched a custard cream. She had left Robert to unpack his kettle and gone straight to a meeting of Leicester University's \"family programme\" - the first scheme in the country designed to support parents through their children's student life. </p> <p>Did Robert know where his mother was? \"I don't think he cares what meeting I'm at as long as I'm out of his room and out of the way,\" she says. \"But I'll pop back to the halls after this to say goodbye. I know I shouldn't but I can't help myself.\" </p> <p>Leicester University launched its family programme in 1996. What started in the form of open days for students' parents has recently mushroomed to include a newsletter, web page, special receptions for parents, discount offers on food and books, university credit cards and a system for ordering cakes and flowers for children sitting exams. </p> <p>It also includes invitations to socialise at exclusive alumni events - this month's is a party on the Cutty Sark - and the hope of persuading parents to sign up for postgraduate courses. The university has a large distance-learning department to spare parents the embarrassment of bumping into their child at lectures. </p> <p>This year, for the first time, Leicester University staged a presentation for parents on the day they dropped off freshers. Not the standard tea and biscuits in the student bar, it was designed to ease the dilemma of parents who want to be there for their fresher children and students who consider themselves adults and do not want their parents around - unless it's to carry hi-fi systems. </p> <p>At the presentation, the university's vice-chancellor, Robert Burgess, and the head welfare officer planned to address parents on finance, sick bays and their chance to use university facilities whenever they wished. Paradoxically, in the age of the gap year where mothers and fathers are encouraged to put their children on a plane to Borneo at 18 and never look back, 2,000 parents signed up. </p> <p>Nigel Siesage, head of the family programme, said 60% of students' parents sign up each year to the lifelong scheme, which is free. \"We aim to provide a point of contact and a form of cultural exchange where parents know exactly what is going on. For most of them, they feel this is the first time they have been excluded from their children's lives,\" he said. </p> <p>The programme is the first sign of a culture where, as grants shrink, parents who fund their children are taking control of student life to be sure of value for money. There is an implication that one day, parents could receive academic reports on their student children, turning university life into an extension of school. </p> <p>\"No, no, no!\" laughs Leicester's vice chancellor, Robert Burgess. \"That could never happen because records of achievements are the property of students. We must not forget that students are legally adults and are here to work autonomously.\" </p> <p>Even so, this year the University has produced postcards with pictures of the halls of residence and details of wardens' numbers which students can send their parents so they know where to reach them. The piles of postcards are depleted at the start of the afternoon. </p> <p>At the family presentation, the university's vice-chancellor stood on a box in the middle of a sea of tea-drinkers in driving shoes. \"I would like to welcome you to the largest convention of removal drivers in Leicester today,\" he told parents. There was nervous laughter. Students' relatives shuffled as they listened to talk about \"a big community\" and \"large learning family\" and fell silent with concentration when details of hardship schemes, paid-work rules and top-up loans were given. Di and Ian Johnson, anoraks still wet from ferrying their son Nick's hi-fi equipment, had come to the meeting for financial tips. Their son had just returned from inter-railing around Europe. </p> <p>\"I'm not nervous, I'm excited,\" said Mrs Johnson. \"I thought the presentation was brilliant. Not every parent is here because they are upset about their birds flying the nest. We just want information.\" </p> <p>First-year genetics student Sukhvans Sandhu, 20, from Nottingham, had followed his parents, brother and sister to the meeting, despite the fact that he was not in the slightest bit nervous. </p> <p>\"I don't mind as long as they're happy,\" he said. \"My eldest daughter went to Cambridge and we had nothing like this there,\" his father Babinder Sandhu said. </p> <p>\"A form of pride in new universities is emerging at Leicester to match the old universities' alumni tradition,\" comments Robert Burgess. \"Over 14% of our students had parents at the university, and we find lots of students come here if their mothers did. The family programme highlights to students and parents that they are joining a community for life.\" </p> <p>Back at the drop-off point at Leicester's Beaumont hall of residence, crowds of 18-year-olds stood arms folded to the sound of \"get in the queue to register, darling\". </p> <p>First-year law student Richard Paul sat embarrassed in a corner of the bar watching motor racing on a large screen only a foot from his face. Every other person in the room was a parent or sibling. \"My mum drove me up from Watford this morning because my dad's just had an operation. But they are divorced anyway, so we wouldn't have done these formal family things,\" Paul said. </p> <p>But his mother did mention a meeting and he suspects she sneaked off to the family presentation after dropping him off. </p> <p>\"I think she may have been a bit sad I've left home,\" he said. \"It's good the university is welcoming parents because it's a bit annoying to have so many sitting in the bar right now. I'd like to go up and say hi to freshers. But it feels awkward when their mums have their arms round their necks.\" </p> <p>As for the university's plan to encourage parents to sign up for distance learning, the first pile of fliers to vanish from the family stands was the postgraduate prospectus.</p>",
  "<p>A word of advice to anyone thinking they might like to run a further education college. Two words, actually: emotional intelligence. Before many more moons have passed, this buzz phrase will be inked on the blotters of every governors' interview board in the sector. </p> <p>And if you, the applicant, can't demonstrate that you've got it in buckets, let alone know what it means, you might as well claim your rail fare straightaway and mooch back home. </p> <p>So, what is it? </p> <p>\"The capacity for recognising our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves and for managing emotions well in ourselves and others,\" explains Lynne Sedgmore, principal of Guildford college. </p> <p>What it definitely isn't is the authoritarian, autocratic, bossy mode which, fairly or unfairly, was attributed to Margaret Thatcher and caricatured as the \"handbagging\" style. Nor is it a management style which the lecturers' union, Natfhe, complains has obtained in a number of colleges in recent years. </p> <p> Sedgmore is very familiar and comfortable with the emotional intelligence concept. It has been tripping off the lips and pens of academics in the leadership field since the 1960s, she says. </p> <p>She is clearly fascinated by the subject. The bookcase in her office in college is dominated by tomes on creative organisation theory and corporate strategy. Her masters degree was on \"transformational\" leadership, her dissertation entitled Change Agent Skills and Strategies. </p> <p>\"My research has been on looking at how leaders develop themselves professionally and personally and become great leaders.\" </p> <p>And so it was of no surprise to those who knew her that she was among the first batch of 100 college principals who volunteered for the further education leadership programme, funded by the DfEE, which began in January. </p> <p>And no surprise that she was the principal invited to address her peers on this subject at a principals' conference in Liverpool last week entitled Leadership 2000. </p> <p>Her address focused on emotional intelligence as a crucial attribute for future college leaders, and it was at the core of the leadership programme from which the first wave of principals have just emerged. </p> <p>Not all of these people by any means were so familiar with the concept as she was. </p> <p>\"For the majority of people it was very, very new,\" she says. </p> <p>The programme guaranteed its participants absolute discretion. There would be no leaking back to colleges details of how their principals performed. </p> <p>Lynne Sedgmore is equally anxious to preserve confidentiality, adding that considerable trust and camaraderie developed among the groups of 15 or so, into which they divided. </p> <p>But she does admit that the programme delivered a few whammies to some, starting with the introductory module entitled Taking Stock. </p> <p>Its key feature was \"360 degree appraisal\". Each principal had to complete a questionnaire appraising him - or herself on 20 emotional \"competencies\" which together add up to this notion of emotional intelligence. They start with emotional self-awareness, and range through self management, social awareness and social skills. </p> <p>If this wasn't sobering enough, the real rub was to come. For every principal, five colleagues from their college completed the same questionnaire, giving their assessments of their boss. </p> <p>The only consolation was that principals could choose the five to appraise them. This turned out to be no consolation at all in some cases. </p> <p>\"There were stark discrepancies between some principals' views of themselves and their staff's views of them.\" </p> <p>Sedgmore won't break the omert\u00e0 of the group, but drops some hints. </p> <p>\"It is easier for women to relate to this model and to exhibit some of these competencies. </p> <p>\"But there were some men who came up high too.\" </p> <p>The next module - Leadership - proved an even bigger blow for some. This considered six leadership styles used in combination by good leaders: coercive, authoritative, democratic, pace-setting, coaching and affiliative ie \"very focused on people and encouraging them\". </p> <p>\"According to the analysis, the ways that some principals led their colleges were very different to the profiles we were being shown of effective leadership.\" </p> <p>Participants agreed that this was the most challenging part of the programme. Was anybody's confidence shattered? </p> <p>\"No. By the time you reach chief executive level you're strong enough, so that even if this doesn't give you a strong leadership profile, you decide to change and accept the mode, or whatever.\" </p> <p>Sedgmore has little doubt that the emotional intelligence model will now become de rigueur for anyone applying for a principal's job. </p> <p>The second batch of 100 principals is soon to start the programme. And a similar programme is just about to begin for senior college managers and aspiring principals. </p> <p>Further education has certainly caught the zeitgeist. Concern about the quality of British leadership is sweeping through government, and the public and private sectors. </p> <p>In best Whitehall tradition, a committee has been formed for the task. The Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership was launched jointly by the Department for Education and Employment and the Department for Trade and Industry in April. Top of its list of aims is making sure that the UK \"is able to develop the managers and leaders of the future to match the best in the world\". </p> <p>Obviously the project needs time. \"What do we mean by excellence in management and leadership? We're at a very early stage in that work,\" she says. </p> <p>No single model has emerged as favourite, which begs a question. Has further education jumped the gun? </p> <p>The leadership programme was put out to tender by the Further Education Funding Council. This was won by the Further Education Development Agency (Feda), in partnership with Hay McBer, an international firm of human resource consultants which was already working on leadership programmes with school heads. </p> <p>Was the decision to run with the \"emotional intelligence\" model chiefly driven by a desire for an obvious change from the autocratic, authoritarian style which has been perceived in the sector over the past decade? </p> <p>\"No,\" says a senior Feda figure involved in this crucial decision. </p> <p>\"It was driven by the idea of leadership as opposed to management. </p> <p>\"And it's not the opposite of taking tough decisions.\" </p> <p> <strong>How do you measure up?</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Emotional intelligence: the 20 components </strong><br> </p> <p>\u0095 Emotional self-awareness </p> <p>\u0095 Accurate self assessment </p> <p>\u0095 Self-confidence </p> <p>\u0095 Self-control </p> <p>\u0095 Trustworthiness </p> <p>\u0095 Conscientiousness </p> <p>\u0095 Adaptability </p> <p>\u0095 Achievement orientation </p> <p>\u0095 Initiative </p> <p>\u0095 Empathy </p> <p>\u0095 Organisational awareness </p> <p>\u0095 Service orientation </p> <p>\u0095 Developing others </p> <p>\u0095 Leadership </p> <p>\u0095 Influence </p> <p>\u0095 Communication </p> <p>\u0095 Change catalyst </p> <p>\u0095 Conflict management </p> <p>\u0095 Building bonds </p> <p>\u0095 Teamwork and collaboration</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Ofsted inspector</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> This former inspector has three teenage sons. He has chosen to remain anonymous.</strong> </p> <p> \"I'd start by getting the latest performance tables to see what the results looked like. This wouldn't give the full picture of how the school had done by its kids, so I'd then look at the latest Ofsted report to look at the key stage 3 results to see how the school had done in comparison with similar schools. Schools are banded according to the number of pupils on free meals; not everyone accepts this as an accurate way to compare schools, but it does at least give an indication of how well a school is doing. </p> <p>\"I would also expect to see 95% or more of pupils achieving A* to G grades at GCSE; any less and it could suggest that the school had a major problem with kids dropping out of education entirely in year 11. </p> <p>\"Within the Ofsted report there is a section labelled 'Key Issues'. I would look extremely closely at these. Some may bother you, others may not. For example, if it was reported that the school had no regular act of religious worship, I would not be at all concerned; if, however, it said that the school needed to make significant progress in English then I would want to know from the teaching staff what steps had been taken to act on this. </p> <p>\"Finally I would look in the school prospectus for the difference between the boys' and girls' GCSE results. If there was a significant difference, it would suggest that not much was being demanded of the kids and that they were being left to get on with it themselves. As a rule, girls are more conscientious than boys and will do the work even when they're not supervised. Boys will generally use the opportunity to do nothing.\" </p> <p><strong> The headteacher</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> John Adam is head of Crookhorn Community School in Waterlooville, Hants. He has three children.</strong> </p> <p> \"After reading the school report on the Ofsted website (<a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk\">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>), the first piece of information I would want is the figure for the average total passes at GCSE, as the headline figures of five or more passes at grade C or above give an incomplete picture. Schools can achieve good headline figures in a number of subtle ways; some may even make it clear to parents that less able children will struggle at the school. This may deter them from applying. Schools are under severe pressure and they can focus their main teaching effort on those who stand a good chance of reaching grade C and above at potential cost to the others. I would like to see how many children were not entered for any GCSEs and how many had five passes at any grade to assess how well the school had helped the less able to fulfil their potential. </p> <p>\"I would also want to know that the headteacher took full responsibility for everything that went on within the school. A key question to ask here is what line the school takes on children who misbehave on the way to and from school. A good head will consider that the school's reputation extends well beyond the front gate. </p> <p>\"Not all schools are organised in the same way, so I would be keen to know whether pupils are taught in mixed ability groups or in group ability sets. If they were taught in sets I would want to know on what basis the assessment is made and what opportunities exist for movement between the different groupings and when they will happen. </p> <p>\"To see how the school communicated with parents, I would ask to see a typical report, with the child's name blanked out, to check that it was in clear English - intelligible and informative about a child's progress, in regard to his or her potential and also in relation to peers. I would also want to know how often reports would be issued and how often the school would be in touch with me. </p> <p>\"All schools have to impose sanctions on their pupils, but a good school would do so within a framework of rewards that reinforces positive behaviour. Children have to be made aware when they have done wrong but they need to know they have a second chance, so I would question teachers carefully about this. </p> <p>\"Parents are a good source of information, though some have private agendas. To offset this I would target members of the Parent Teacher Association, particularly those who have had two or three children at the school. PTA members will have had direct involvement with the school and its teachers and are best placed to talk about the ethos and policies of the school. Staff turnover can also give a pointer to staff morale, but one would want to be careful about jumping to conclusions. If staff were moving to take on deputy headships or other promotions, you could assume that the school was a great training ground for teachers and therefore good for your child. A simple question asking how many new members of staff the school has taken on should be sufficient to get this information. </p> <p>\"Most schools are experts at putting their best foot forward at open days, but they can't cover up the basic maintenance of the buildings. If it looks really shabby, then it is likely that school morale is low. While looking at classroom displays I would want to see that the full range of abilities are represented, not just the best. </p> <p>\"I would find it hard to believe there was any school that was unaffected by bullying and the school prospectus should state its policy clearly. However, I would also want to check this out with other parents and pupils. Pupils are always a good source of feedback and I would give my child the chance to visit the school and talk to the other children. </p> <p>\"Finally, I would check how open the school was to external benchmarking, such as Investors in People (the Cabinet Office charter mark for quality public services), Investors in Careers (run by the Careers Service) and the School's Curriculum Award (run by the School's Curriculum Award Trust). Of course, it's not essential for a school to get involved in these, but the assessments are rigorous, so you will know the school has the self-confidence to welcome external evaluation.\" </p> <p><strong> The head of department</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Marion Bird is head of religious and social education at Orleans Park School, Twickenham, London. She has three children.</strong> </p> <p> \"You can get a good feel for a school at a visit by observing the relationships between teachers and children. Are the pupils helping out, asking questions and generally getting involved or are the teachers doing all the work? If it's the latter, there's a fair chance the school may not be a dynamic and exciting place for children to learn. </p> <p>\"I would want to see a range of work on display to be reassured that all ability groups were included. I wouldn't be too worried about seeing spelling mistakes in exercise books, but I would expect to see signs that learning was taking place, so I would be looking out for encouraging comments next to work, together with some form of obvious assessment. </p> <p>\"It's hard for schools to gloss over weak points as parents have access to league table results and Ofsted reports, but most parents tend to focus on English, maths and science. I would also want to know more about other departments, especially if my child had expressed an interest in them. </p> <p>\"The head's address at an open day can also be a good indicator. It may be well rehearsed but if they speak with passion and leadership, it's likely they speak the same way at assembly; if it's downbeat manner then the kids are almost certainly going to find the headteacher uninspirational too, and won't be motivated to do their best. </p> <p>\"The best way to find out about a school, though, is to ask questions of the staff and pupils. A good, confident school will allow its senior pupils to take parents on a tour; they will be mostly diplomatic but they can be quite open, too. Hopefully, your child will be able to come with you on the tour and this is their opportunity to ask about anything that has been worrying them. However, do talk through all their concerns before the visit so that you can discuss them with staff and pupils if your child doesn't.\" </p> <p><strong> The teacher</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Elena Mauro is special needs coordinator at Loughborough Junior School in London. She has one son and one stepdaughter.</strong> </p> <p> \"Parents often find it hard to be realistic about their children's abilities, but you can't make an accurate assessment of a school without making an informed judgment of what your child needs. You need to ask yourself questions like, 'Is he better at maths than English and in what sort of environment does he learn best?' Only then can you ask the right questions to find out whether the school can be responsive to those needs. For instance, if I had a child with special needs I would want to know that there would be provision from day one and not halfway through the first term. </p> <p>\"League tables give a very partial view: I would want to know details of the intake and the proportion of special needs or bilingual children to get an idea of how much value the school has added. And if there are kids hanging around aimlessly then you can safely assume that morale is low. </p> <p>\"Secondary schools are an alien world to primary schools, and children have to go from being big babies to mini-adults in the course of the summer. Many find it very difficult to adjust to the transition of not having one class teacher and having to learn their way round a new environment where they are the youngest, so I would want to know what measures the school took to ease the new intake into the routine. For the same reasons, I would also want to know that there would be some children with similar backgrounds to my child's so that he would fit in and make friends. </p> <p>\"I would also want to see examples of the children's work in all age groups. Standards can vary in different year groups and I would want to be satisfied that progress was being made year on year. To make sure I wasn't just being shown the best work, I would like each child's work books to be made available.\"</p>",
  "The Millennium Dome suffered yet another blow yesterday when attendance figures dropped to their lowest since a disastrous showing in January cost its former chief executive Jennie Page her job. <p>Fewer than 15,500 people a day visited the attraction in September, the most torrid month in its history, when news of a further \u00a347m bail-out, revelations of financial chaos and a final government admission that it had \"failed to live up to expectations\" left its fortunes at an all-time low.</p> <p>The figures were nearly 50,000 down on August but the dome's irrepressible chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, who was forced to cede financial control to the City troubleshooter David James in last month's shake-up, still tried to paint the figures as a triumph.</p> <p>\"We are getting thousands of satisfied visitors through the dome every day, and the overwhelming majority enjoy a fantastic day out,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Gerbeau predicted that the fresh horrors he has planned for Halloween will pack in families over the half-term. \"There are only 91 days left in which to visit the dome and I would urge people not to miss out.\"</p> <p>Although Mr James has reduced the dome's target to 4.5m paying visitors, Mr Gerbeau still fervently believes the total figures can still reach 7m. With nearly 4.8m people having already gone through the turnstiles - with 3,847,911 of those paying - the dome is likely to attract at least 6m people before it closes on December 31, half the original target. A big promotion push launched this week by Mr Gerbeau, aimed at drawing in repeat visitors with cut-price offers, could nudge that figure up, however.</p> <p>He believes that, as a BBC poll showed that nearly eight out of 10 visitors enjoyed their day, it should be easier to preach to the converted than attract new visitors.</p> <p>He is also counting on the \"Expo effect\" to start kicking in soon when the public realise it is their last chance. Nearly a third of the people who went to the last Expo in Lisbon did so in the last six weeks.</p> <p>Dome merchandise, already discounted last month, has been cut further, with cuddly toys of its mascots, Coggesley and Sprinx, being sold at a third of their original price.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lord Falconer, the minister for the dome, who has so far ridden out a chorus of calls for his resignation, said he would make public the scathing auditors' report from PricewaterhouseCoopers that precipitated its last crisis. His spokesman said a copy of the report, which has already been widely leaked, would be placed in the Commons library later this week.</p> <p>But he has no plans to release reports by the accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche for the millennium commission, which his critics claim alerted him to the dome's financial mismanagement and \"pie-in-the-sky\" business plan as early as last February. His spokesman said: \"Those reports are the property of the commission and it is up to them to decide whether they should be published. Lord Falconer has no say in that whatsoever.\"</p>",
  "<p>Warning: There is a very real risk of the UK business environment turning into a state of information paranoia. The government may promise to deliver transparent and open management of the economy, but we in the internet sector are seeing a probing and increasingly secretive establishment. </p> <p>People automatically switch off when they see that the regulation of investigatory powers (Rip) bill relates to computer communications. This attitude seems to be reflected in the House of Commons, where only 40 or so MPs bothered to turn up for the bill's second reading. For the third reading there were only 30. The only decent debate took place in House of Lords. </p> <p>The bill states clearly that: \"Emails can be intercepted for the purpose of safeguarding the economic wellbeing of the UK.\" One could therefore assume that the bill will enhance the economic \"health\" of our country. Quite the contrary is, in fact, true. This rushed and rather sketchily defined piece of legislation will make the UK a less attractive location for the headquarters of international companies. </p> <p>This bill has a somewhat conspiratorial and Big Brotherly edge to it. Take the recent BMW Longbridge affair. It was definitely in the UK's economic interest to keep the car manufacturing plant open. Under Rip legislation the government could have intercepted BMW's electronic communications between Germany and the UK. Economic fairplay? I don't think so. I doubt if foreign investors would either. This legislation is giving global businesses a major disincentive to deal with the UK. </p> <p>The business community is also concerned about a clause in Part 3 of the bill, which sets out the remit for the \"notice of disclosure requirements\", whereby senior members of a company are required to allow government agencies access to encrypted communications through the submission of an \"encryption key\". These notices must be served to a senior member of the company, that is the company director or secretary. According to the bill this person can be prosecuted if he reveals the details to anyone, and could receive a jail sentence of up to five years. If a director can be imprisoned for tipping off fellow board members of the notice, this has serious corporate governance implications. It makes it illegal to tell someone what the government has required you to do. I see the need for more balanced investigatory powers for fraud, terrorism or sex crimes, which this legislation also tries to address. </p> <p>Of concern is the possibility to interrogate computer systems of perfectly legal companies.Other countries have learnt to adapt. In Singapore the government has carried out a complete U-turn on the issue of encryption of electronic communications. Just a year ago all business emails in Singapore came through government-owned servers. Now all barriers on the import of cryptographic equipment have been lifted. Singapore is an extremely attractive location for regional offices, global headquarters, or for use as a main communications hub for internet connectivity. </p> <p>Parts 1 and 2 of the legislation are now law, but part 3 is not expected to be enforced until late 2001. A period of six to eight weeks \"consultation\" between government and industry will be announced before this. I urge everyone to review this legislation and to make their views known. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Latham is chief executive officer of Bluewave, an online creations company based in the UK</p>",
  "The lethal clashes between Palestinians and Israeli military and police forces over the past four days are proof of the failure of Israeli strategy since the Oslo process. A first hint of that failure was given during the Camp David summit, when the Palestinian delegation, headed by Yasser Arafat, agreed to many painful concessions, but rejected any possibility of Israeli sovereignty over the Al Aqsa complex. The recent clashes are fully exposing the failure. <p>Israel has failed to consolidate a process of pacification, which has been wrongly termed a peace process. Palestinians of all ranks have warned for years that such a policy, which disregards their basic claim for a dignified existence, based upon principles of equality and respect of their history and suffering and ties to the country, will eventually fail. Israel did not listen - as it didn't listen to their warning on the eve of the 1987 uprising. </p> <p>Since the first Israeli redeployment in the Gaza Strip and later in the West Bank, in 1994 and 1995-6, and since the establishment of a Palestinian self-rule regime, Israel has been the supreme sovereign. It has exercised its power to the full, controlling vital aspects of Palestinian life. It has full control over 61% of the West Bank and 20% of the Gaza Strip, where it expands settlements, builds new roads which mainly serve those settlements and their links with Israel proper - all at the expense of Palestinian land and territorial contiguity. Israel is still in full control of the allocation of water to both Israelis and Palestinians. The Palestinians are as discriminated against in this distribution, as they have been for the past 30 years. In summer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians do not have running water, while Jewish settlements have all they need. </p> <p>Israel also controls Palestinian freedom of movement. In 1991, an Israeli military order annulled the right of Palestinians to freedom of movement and introduced a new policy of passes. This policy, which started years before Hamas had planned suicide attacks, has been perfected over the years, especially since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority. </p> <p>Only 2-300,000 Palestinians, out of some 3m, have even a limited travel permit, enabling them to move between Gaza and the West bank and/or to Israel. These permits might be annulled or withdrawn at any moment by Israel. This policy, known as closure, has affected all aspects of Palestinian life, individually and communally, It has brought economical deterioration, social and family separation, cultural deprivation and psychological stress. </p> <p>At the same time, Israel has pampered the Palestinian civil and security leadership with privileges - in particular freedom of movement. The Israeli-given privileges have been one of the main reasons for the leadership's access to economic prosperity, denied to the rest of the population. The backbone of the Oslo accord has become the security forces and the political organisation - Fatah. </p> <p>At times, Palestinian policemen have shot at their own people and, more often, prevented them from approaching the Israeli military posts which are scattered all over the West Bank and Gaza. In a society of high unemployment, joining the police forces - in numbers far beyond those permitted in the Oslo agreements - has become the chief source of income. The privileged lifestyle of the Palestinian leadership and its close political and economic ties with Israeli elites has led to growing criticism. During the negotiations over the interim agreement (which keeps being extended and renewed), the Palestinian leaders have been dealing with the same officials who grant them their privileged positions, known as VIP status. They have shown much flexibility in regard to the timetable and continuation of talks in spite of the expanding construction of settlements. </p> <p>The compromised position of the Palestinian National Authority has led to its arresting and detaining without trial hundreds of people who have criticised the Oslo accord. Security cooperation between the two sides also led to the arrest of people suspected of terrorist activity against Israel. During the interim period, the PNA has made a big contribution to the sense of security enjoyed by Israelis. </p> <p> Palestinians have grown accustomed to the idea that, in return for personal benefits, their leadership is preparing for a settlement which will be closer to the Israeli and American view than theirs. This settlement will not be based upon UN resolutions, will not have the July 4 1967 borders as the basis, will not allow refugees to return home, and will end in the dissection of Palestinian territory into several enclaves through the mass annexation of settlements to Israel. </p> <p>The Palestinian leadership's basic disregard for the people's suffering - mainly caused by the closure policy - and the PNA's impotence in relation to the Israeli settlement policy have strengthened such a conclusion. It seems that Israel has counted on such a development since 1994, while always stressing the imperative of security collaboration between the two sides, and emphasising Arafat's promise to stop all acts of violence and terror. </p> <p>For the Palestinians, and their leadership, the Oslo accord meant a gradual withdrawal of occupation, in return for an immediate halt to violence and terror. Seven years after the Oslo accord, all Palestinians feel betrayed, because they are still living under occupation. They have tried to express their anger and frustration, and make the Israelis listen to them, in several ways. Because they have not been listened to, they have backed terrorist attacks in Israel. </p> <p>They doubted their leadership was able to develop a successful strategy out of their martyrdom and their bloodshed. After each clash with Israelis, Palestinian police prevented them from renewing their attacks. This gave Israel good reason to trust its strategy: the Palestinian security organs continue to participate in subduing by force and a few promises to their angry, frustrated people. </p> <p>Since Camp David, the Al Aqsa mosque has become the crux of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has become the issue where Arafat knows he is totally backed by Muslims the world over: he did not change his stance. </p> <p>When six Palestinians were killed by close-range bullets at the mosque by Israeli police, the anger which swept everybody contained all other angers, of seven years and longer. This time Arafat could not dream of checking the spreading anger with his security forces. After all, it was about Al Aqsa. All his credibility would have been lost, so he ordered the policemen to stop. Even without an order, his policemen were unable to restrain their fire, while watching Palestinian youngsters being shot in their eyes and heads by the hundreds. Even if the clashes are subdued, the Palestinians now demand a change in the rules of the game. And their message is meant not only for Israel but for Arafat too. </p> <p>Amira Hass is an Israeli journalist whose book about the Israeli occupation, Drinking the Sea at Gaza, is published by Hamish Hamilton. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A state of war engulfed parts of the West Bank and Gaza strip yesterday as the Israeli army unleashed tanks and helicopter gunships against Palestinian rioters. <p>The resort to Israel's military might defied appeals by world leaders to end the bloodiest violence for four years, and arrives amid deepening suspicions that the prime minister, Ehud Barak, is losing his grip on the situation. </p> <p>After five days of rioting, in which Palestinian security men joined forces with stone-throwing youths, the toll rose inexorably to 47 dead and more than 1,000 injured. </p> <p>These clashes are far more severe than earlier unrest in the West Bank and Gaza. During the intifada which erupted in 1987, Palestinians vented their rage with rocks. Now, they are joined in battle by Palestinian police forces, who are well trained and armed with automatic weapons. </p> <p>In the West Bank yesterday, the tanks took up position opposite luxury flats in Ramallah and trundled menacingly towards armed protesters in Nablus undercover from helicopter gunships firing at a Palestinian security position in Gaza. </p> <p>Alarm bells were ringing for Mr Barak as the violence moved decisively into the heartland of the Jewish state, with the first Israeli civilian killed yesterday morning. Israeli-Arab citizens wrought havoc in cities that were once models of peaceful co-existence. </p> <p>Mr Barak convened a special session of his security cabinet and appealed to Israeli Arabs, who make up nearly 20% of Israel's population of 6m, to cease their protests. </p> <p>\"No country can tolerate these kinds of violence scenes and disorder on the part of its citizens, as hurt as they may be,\" he said. </p> <p>Seven Israeli Arabs, 10 Palestinians and one Israeli Jew were killed yesterday in clashes that have been spreading from the green hills of the northern Galilee to towns such as Sakhnin and Acre and even to Jaffa, which runs into Tel Aviv. </p> <p>Most alarming for Israeli security forces was the spread of violence across the \"Green Line\", which divides Israel proper from the occupied Gaza strip and West Bank. </p> <p>At the Netzarim junction in the Gaza strip, troops fired anti-tank missiles and traded fire from helicopter gunships with members of the Palestinian security forces. Palestinians stormed a command post and plucked an Israeli flag from an abandoned watchtower. </p> <p>The first Israeli civilian to die in the violence was shot dead at close range as he drove to a popular shopping destination in the West Bank yesterday morning. A school bus travelling to the Jewish settlement of Shiloh also came under fire, but nobody was injured. </p> <p>Roads were closed in parts of Jerusalem and people evacuated from some isolated Jewish settlements. </p> <p>Meanwhile, with sentiments blunted by the unrelenting violence, there were new horrors, with reports that a two-year-old Palestinian girl was killed when her parents' car came under a hail of bullets on Sunday night. </p> <p>Despite the continued bloodshed, Mr Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, appeared unmoved by international appeals for a ceasefire. </p> <p>Mr Barak warned: \"Bloodshed could cause great damage to the chances of continuing the peace process and a major deterioration.\" Mr Arafat retorted: \"Stop shooting our soldiers, our old people, our youths, our women. Get Israeli soldiers out of Palestinian cities and refugee camps.\" </p> <p>On the barricades and in the hospitals of Umm al-Fahm, they were chanting the same demand. In the emergency room of al-Hayaa clinic, angry young men jumped from their stretchers and hoisted their shirts to display the angry red bruises left by rubber bullets. \"Look what they did to me,\" said one. \"And I am a citizen of Israel.\" </p> <p>Although Umm al-Fahm is a stronghold of the Islamist movement which has radicalised Israeli Arabs in recent years, their decision to join the battle for Jerusalem was made not because of religion, but because of images of their Palestinian kin dying in the clashes. </p> <p>When the people of Umm al-Fahm took to the streets on Sunday, riot police opened up first with rubber bullets and then live fire. </p> <p>They killed Mohammed Jabreen, 25, a construction worker, who, friends say, harboured no greater ambition than to get married, buy a car and save enough money for his own flat. </p> <p>Yesterday's violence was intended to avenge that death. Overnight, rampaging mobs ransacked symbols of the Israeli state on the high street, including banks and the main post office. </p> <p>For a second day, they barricaded the entrance to the town, stopping traffic on the main highway through Israel's Galilee Then they set off for the funeral of the man killed in Sunday's clashes. </p> <p>Omri - as his friends called him - had seen the footage of the 12-year-old boy killed in Gaza at the weekend and decided to take to the streets. </p> <p>\"It wasn't a question of West Bank or Gaza or Israel,\" says Ahmed Jabreen, joining the circle of friends gathering near the dead man's house. \"All of us are one people. We are all one family.\" </p> <p>As the fighting spread through the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli settlers lay low. Children stayed home from school, residents travelled to work in heavily guarded convoys along back roads and in one besieged community holiday visitors were evacuated by helicopter.</p>",
  "The officer in charge of the investigation into the Real IRA's bombing of Omagh two years ago yesterday said he knew who was behind the attack, which killed 29 people in the Co Tyrone town. <p>Eric Anderson, acting assistant chief constable of the RUC, said at the inquest into the August 1998 massacre that the investigation was \"active and ongoing\". There was much work to be done, he said. </p> <p>Mr Anderson told the inquest, at Omagh leisure complex, that 6,500 people had been interviewed, 3,500 homes and premises visited, 2,700 statements recorded and 15,200 actions taken. Gardai had arrested 58 people, while the RUC had held 23 more, seeking the bombers and the godfathers of the dissident republican outfit. </p> <p>John Leckey, the coroner for greater Belfast who is presiding over the four-week inquest, is expected to deliver his findings into 28 of the victims today. The 29th inquest - the case of James Barker, 12, is to be on Thursday. </p> <p>In a statement, Mr Anderson said the bomb and the bombers originated from Co Louth, in the Irish Republic. Asked if he was aware of who made up the entire team involved in the bombing, he replied: \"There is good background knowledge as a result of the investigation.\" </p> <p>He disclosed that the bombers claimed the warnings they issued were accurate. Evidence has indicated three warning calls were unclear about the location of the device, 500lb of homemade explosive in a stolen Vauxhall Cavalier, and gave conflicting details about when it was due to explode. </p> <p>Mr Anderson said 385 specific exhibits had been collected, 40 tonnes of rubble, 13 large skips, 17 wheelie bins, 11 flip-top bins and a number of large bags. Investigating officers had also gathered 237 videos, taken by tourists and from border crossing security cameras. </p> <p>The officer in charge on the ground that day, Sgt Philip Marshall, was reduced to tears when he described encountering the body of 18-month-old Maura Monaghan. He said he believed she was his own daughter. </p> <p>Sergeant Marshall told the court how he restored a semblance of order to the scene amid the carnage. He assured the bereaved that their loved ones were not left to die alone.</p>",

  "A circle of 15 bullet holes on a cinder block wall, and a smear of darkening blood. That is what marks the spot where a terrified 12-year-old boy spent his final moments, cowering in his father's arms, before he was hit by a final shot to the stomach, and slumped over, dead. <p>Those last minutes in the life of Mohammed al-Durrah, captured in sickening detail by a Palestinian cameraman working for French TV, have taken on a power of their own. His death, aired around the world on Saturday night, has become the single searing image of these days of bloody rioting. </p> <p>The pictures of Mohammed's death seemed not just to encapsulate the horror of these last five days but also to have become its motor. Outside the al-Durrah home in a sandy lane of the Bourij refugee camp, children his age and even younger are fighting over photocopied strips of the final eight frames in the boy's life. Here, the version of his death includes images too disturbing for most broadcasters: the loosening of a dying boy's grip on his father, Jamal, and his father's convulsive twitch when he was struck by more rounds. </p> <p>Though more Palestinians have been killed since Mohammed's death - including a two-year-old yesterday - it is his image that haunts Israel. For all of the claims of the prime minister, Ehud Barak, and other officials that their soldiers only fire to protect Israeli lives, Mohammed's death seems an irrefutable reply. </p> <p>The images of al-Dirreh and his son cowering, vainly, behind a barrel would have been emotive enough if, as first reports suggested, they were caught in the crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police or protesters. But by the end of the weekend the evidence was pointing to a still more chilling conclusion: that the 12-year-old boy and his father were deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>For Israelis, the camera footage of Mohammed's death makes exceedingly uncomfortable viewing. Which might explain why - for all the furore his death has caused worldwide - it has caused barely a ripple here. The English-language edition of the Ha'aretz newspaper, the most liberal of Israel's press, confined its reporting to 21 lines on the front page, focused on an Israeli army investigation into the killing. For those who have been tracking the pattern of violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the location of Mohammed's death could almost have been predicted. </p> <p>Over the years, Netzarim junction, where Mohammed was killed, has been a regular point of confrontation between Israeli troops, and Palestinian youths. The source of the friction on an otherwise unremarkable junction on Gaza's main coastal road is an Israeli army post, a hunkering fortress of armoured steel and concrete with watchtowers on each of its four corners. The post, on the north-west corner of the junction, is the frontline defence for the Jewish settlement of Netzarim to the west. So contentious is the Jewish settlement that its occupants - a mere 60 families - are under strict orders to travel only by military convoys. </p> <p>For Palestinians, the heavily guarded Netzarim settlement is a symbol of their continued occupation, seven years after the start of the peace process. So, by extension, is the post at Netzarim junction, which any Palestinians from Bourij or the other refugee camps to the south have to negotiate, if they want to visit Gaza City. </p> <p>\"When the people of Palestine are crying out against Israel, they find this place to throw stones. It is a target for all the anger against the people sitting in their belly and in their bedroom,\" says Brigadier General Osama al-Ali. </p> <p>He was speaking from the other installation that played a crucial part in Mohammed's death. As well as the Israeli position, the junction also houses a small command post of Palestinian security forces who, under interim peace arrangements, are mandated to jointly patrol the area with Israeli troops. </p> <p>The post, a small hut really, lies diagonally across the junction from the Israeli position, at a distance of perhaps 100 yards. </p> <p>This was the stage on which the al-Durrahs blundered, father and son, on Saturday morning. Although Mohammed's uncles feel obliged to describe him as a studious boy, his mother and his six surviving siblings recall a playful child who wanted always to be where the action was. His mother, Amal, says he had wanderlust and would often run off to the beach or, when there were protests, to watch the older boys throw rocks. </p> <p>On Friday night, in his home in the Bourij refugee camp, Mohammed was watching the rioting on television. \"When he saw what happened in Jerusalem on TV, he asked me: 'Can I go to join the protests in Netzarim?' I did not dare to answer him. I did not want him to go,\" she says. </p> <p>Which is why on that fateful morning, Jamal al-Dirreh says he took steps to steer his son away from trouble. The two set off for the used car auction in Gaza City. Mohammed was excited at the outing. They started for home by taxi, but, with the trouble already starting, the driver refused to cross Netzarim. Jamal and Mohammed tried to cross the junction on foot; it was a fatal mistake. </p> <p>Caught in a burst of firing, the pair sought shelter behind a concrete water butt, about 15 yards to the east of the Palestinian post, diagonally opposite the Israeli position. The father gestured frantically towards the Israelis, as if pleading with them to stop firing. They did not. </p> <p>\"They were cleaning the area. Of course they saw the father,\" says Talal Abu-Rama, the camera man who watched the horror unfold. \"They were aiming at the boy, and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times.\" </p> <p>The result of that salvo is visible on the cinderblock wall. Aside from the circle of bullet holes - most of them below waist level - the expanse of wall is largely unscarred. This appeared to suggest that the Israeli fire was targeted at the father and son. </p> <p>The impression is reinforced by other Palestinians at the scene, including a volunteer in the ambulance which tried to get the pair out. \"There was still some breath left in him when we reached the ambulance, but when we opened the doors, they started shooting again,\" says Bassam al-Bilbays, who was riding with the ambulance. The driver was shot dead. </p> <p>Inevitably, the Israeli army version of Mohammed's death is rather different. Although the army expressed regret about the boy's death, it said the soldiers in their armoured post had been under fire. \"I am sorry for this kid. But we are sure that this kid and his father were not there by accident. They were there like the others throwing stones, and throwing Molotovs [petrol bombs],\" Major-General Yom Tov Samia told Israeli radio. </p> <p>But in an interview with Israeli television, General Samia suggested the boy had not been killed by Israelis at all, but by Palestinian police, or rioters: \"I have no doubt that the gunfire, as it appears in the television close-up, was not from Israeli soldiers.\" </p> <p>That explanation is also difficult to sustain. During the fury of these clashes, Palestinian forces have turned their guns on Israeli troops - rather than try to contain their own people. The Palestinian General al-Ali admits his men did open fire at the Israelis. However, he claims that his men did not try to exact revenge until much later on that bloody afternoon. </p> <p>\"We saw our kids dying and we could not help them,\" he said. \"Of course, some people went mad later in the afternoon, when they saw what happened.\" </p> <p>Palestinians at the scene - including the cameraman - also cast doubt on the Israeli claim that father and son were caught in the crossfire between the two security forces. \"At the beginning of the clash, there was some shooting from the same area, but after five minutes they [the Palestinians] ran away from there. Nobody was shooting from the base,\" says Abu Rameh. He says he heard fire from only one direction - the Israeli camp. </p> <p>Abu Rameh also believes it unlikely that the Israeli fire could have been directed further down the road from the water butt where the al-Durrahs sought shelter. \"In that whole area, there was nobody except me, the boy and his father,\" the camera man says. </p> <p>Whatever the truth about the circumstances surrounding his death, Mohammed's terrified face has now entered the grim gallery of images that have come to symbolise - and often to powerfully influence - a conflict. That is of little comfort to his mother, Amal al-Durrah. She keeps imagining he will walk in the door to check on the love birds in their pink cage. </p> <p>\"Nothing good will come of this. We will have many more martyrs, and nothing will change.\"</p>",
  "<p>As part of the Doctors On Trial season, <strong> Why Doctors Make Mistakes</strong> (Channel 4) inevitably had to detail exactly what those quite horrific errors are. The doctor who was supposed to be administering life-saving drugs to a lymphatic cancer sufferer, actually killed him by injecting the wrong drug into his spine. Another doctor pierced the lining of a patient's lung while trying to find a vein. A nurse only just prevented a woman, who was in hospital because she feared she was infertile, from having her tubes tied. </p> <p>Such stories are the stuff of nightmares and headlines. Now that we have traded dinner tables for campfires, they are our ghost stories, our urban myths. These days, everybody knows somebody who knows somebody who went into hospital to get their tonsils out and was discharged with a vasectomy. </p> <p>While medical errors may not be that epidemic, they might as well be, since every story of misdiagnosis, drug mix-ups or surgeries gone wrong chips away at the faith we have in the medical profession. Although no official figures exist - this being a dirty little secret - there are an estimated 320,000 accidents per year in the UK resulting in 40,000 deaths. In every hospital in the country, patients are dying needlessly. </p> <p>But as terrible and tragic as the stories of malpractice are, there is perhaps a lesson to be learned from them. </p> <p>We want doctors to be infallible, for medicine to be an exact science, for everything to be fine. We want to believe that while we're not immortal, we are, at least, pretty resilient and, in case of emergencies, there are people who can put us back together again. We don't want to know that medicine isn't an exact science, that a lot of it is intelligent guesswork and, as such, has a margin for error. </p> <p>We don't want to admit doctors' fallibility because it means facing our own mortality, the distinct lack of happy endings. Of course doctors make mistakes - and some, like the misadministration of Richie Williams' drugs, are unforgivable - but they do so because they are human. We forget it sometimes, as do they (sometimes to an alarming extent), but the fact remains. </p> <p>It is for that reason programmes like Peak Practice and Casualty are so successful: they are anaesthetics against reality. In Cardale and Holby, doctors are heroic. In the real world, flawless heroes are harder to come by, yet still we have great expectations. As always, there is a pressing need for a re-evaluation of how we appreciate doctors and nurses. If fatigue or lack of time for examining patients are factors in mistakes being made, then those factors need to be tackled. Which is to say, there needs to be more money better spent within the NHS. And who ever voted for higher taxes? You don't get something for nothing. Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose. </p> <p>When Grunt Mitchell departed Walford, expectations were high for Ross Kemp, and with <strong> Without Motive</strong> (ITV), the ghost of Grunt is closer than ever to being laid to rest. Alas, after In Defence and Hero Of The Hour - and this drama with Kemp as a CID officer investigating a serial killer in Wales and Bristol - what has replaced it is a succession of bland, identikit members of the law-and-order fraternity all of whom are still essentially Kemp in a too-tight suit. </p> <p>Without Motive was a humourless, moribund police procedural drama you could have been forgiven for thinking was the second part of Tough Love, which was on the night before. In that marginally better effort, Ray Winstone's Lenny was a good egg among bad apples, while Kemp's Jack Mowbray was another exemplary egg in the larder of life. Both men even had the same wife. </p> <p>Taking longer to get started than a 1981 Ford Fiesta, Without Motive was allegedly about the hunt for a serial killer. With its sub-Seven titles, it might have been a worthy successor to Touching Evil, but it was not to be. The first dead body turned up soon enough, but then, inexplicably, there was a let's-meet-the-policemen interlude which was as dull as it sounds, even if one of them was Welsh and went to Andrew Neil's hairdresser. And the worst thing of all about Without Motive? Not one of Jack Mowbray's colleague's was witty enough to give him a nickname. Had he popped into The Cops or even The Bill, he would have been The Pie to all and sundry.</p>",
  "The husband of Sally Clark, the solicitor convicted of the murder of her two baby sons, vowed yesterday to continue to fight for his wife's freedom after an appeal against her two life sentences was thrown out at the high court in London. <p>Three high court judges rejected fresh evidence in support of Clark's claim that her children had died of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids), or \"unascertained death\", stating that there was overwhelming evidence of her guilt at her trial last November. </p> <p>The judges also ruled that despite errors in the way statistics concerning the chances of a family losing two babies to Sids, also known as cot death, were presented at the trial, that did not prejudice the jury in considering its verdict. \"If there had been no error in relation to statistics at the trial, we are satisfied that the jury would still have convicted on each count,\" they said. </p> <p>But Steven Clark, a senior partner in a Manchester law firm, maintained his wife's innocence. \"For 72 days and as many dark nights Sally and I have been waiting. Now three judges, eminent, respected, with intellect beyond ours, decree that Sally did murder her two sons. She did not. They are wrong. </p> <p>\"We are not the first who have had to come to this place [the high court] twice, three, four times or more before achieving justice. I take heart, for though the years may drip slowly by, sense has a way of seeping even through these walls. We will be back, Sally will be released,\" he said. </p> <p>On hearing the verdict, his wife, 35, remained composed, dabbed at her left eye with a handkerchief and mouthed the words \"I love you\" to her husband. Mike Mackie, her solicitor, said: \"She is in a state of shock and disbelief at what has happened to her.\" </p> <p>The couple's children, Christopher, 11 weeks, and Harry, eight weeks, died within 13 months of each other between December 1996 and January 1998. Their mother was alone with both children at the time of their deaths at home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. </p> <p>When Christopher died Dr Alan Williams, the pathologist who examined the child at Macclesfield general hospital, gave the cause of death as an infection of the respiratory tract, a form of Sids, and dismissed evidence of bruising to the child's legs and a cut to his mouth, features that were presented by the crown as evidence of abuse at Clark's murder trial. </p> <p>Within three months of Christopher's death she was pregnant again - \"part of the healing process,\" said her husband - and Harry was born. Eight weeks later he too was dead. </p> <p>Dr Williams also examined Harry and detected rib damage, swelling of the spinal cord, small tears to the brain and bleeding within the eyes. It appeared to him a classic case of death by shaking. </p> <p>His suspicions led him to look again at his notes relating to Christopher, who had been cremated, and he decided the bruising and cut mouth, in addition to samples taken from the boy's lungs which showed evidence of bleeding, suggested that Christopher may have been smothered. A murder inquiry was launched and Clark, who had a third baby boy following Harry's death, was arrested and charged. </p> <p>At the trial at Chester crown court the jury was told that the chances of two babies from a single family dying of Sids were 73 million to one, or once every 100 years, a figure erroneously reached by squaring the ratio for one cot death in a family (around 1:8,500) and ignoring environmental and social factors. </p> <p>Yesterday, the judges accepted that the figure endorsed by the judge was incorrect, but ruled that that had not rendered the conviction unsafe.</p>",
  "As the US presidential election enters its final five weeks, the race is again proving that the winner will not necessarily be the man who gives the people what they want. <p>The candidate who is drawing the largest and most enthusiastic crowds is lagging far behind in the polls; the only man with a black running mate is the least popular with black voters; and the one promising what most Americans want is barely registering. All are third-party candidates. </p> <p>Ralph Nader, the Green party contender and veteran consumer-rights campaigner, drew a crowd of 10,000 on Sunday to hear him speak in Boston, following hard on the heels of gatherings of 10,000 in Seattle, 12,000 in Minnesota and 10,500 in Portland, Oregon. </p> <p>Not only are these higher figures mustered by either Al Gore of the Democrats or George W Bush of the Republicans, but they are paying customers, shelling out up to $10 (\u00a36.75) a time to hear the Nader message. </p> <p>Despite the enthusiasm with which he is greeted, despite high-profile support from actors Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon, filmmaker Michael Moore, chatshow host Phil Donahue and some union leaders, Mr Nader is still stalled at around 5% in surveys of public opinion. </p> <p>The Gore team's efforts to persuade liberal America that \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\", the decision by groups such as Friends of the Earth to back Mr Gore for the same reasons, and the lack of a chance to debate with the two main candidates on television are seen as some of the reasons for Mr Nader's low profile. </p> <p>But his team says that the big rallies are bringing in thousands of extra activists, most of them from the 51% of the electorate who usually do not vote. </p> <p>Their fund-raising efforts, often through house parties, have yielded $4m (\u00a32.7m), just enough to run some provocative commercials, but a fraction of what the Gore and Bush camps are spending. </p> <p>\"We get lots of people who say, 'thank God Ralph's running',\" said Peter Stair of Nader 2000. \"You could say that to get 5% of the vote would be one of our benchmarks, but this is part of a continuing movement which will go on far beyond the election.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, the better Mr Gore does, the bigger chance Mr Nader has of winning votes: if the race between the frontrunners is not seen as not close, Mr Nader's natural supporters may feel more free to back him. </p> <p>Explaining why there were no jokes about Mr Nader, the chatshow host and comedian Jay Leno said: \"Here's a guy, he comes out and tells it like it is. My job's over!\" </p> <p>Mr Nader has reacted to criticism of his lack of past involvement in equality issues by delivering speeches that refer to \"slavery and the genocide of the Native Americans ... the two worst crimes committed in North America\". His running mate, Winona LaDuke, is a Native American academic. </p> <p>His relatively strong standing in key marginal states such as Oregon, Washington and New Mexico have kept him firmly in the Gore camp's sights. </p> <p>The president of Friends of the Earth, Brent Blackwelder, is touring these states on the Democrats' behalf to persuade environmentalists to back Mr Gore, something that has pained the Nader camp deeply. Mr Blackwelder has justified the move by saying: \"We're looking at the reality here. Third-party candidates do not get elected to the presidency.\" </p> <p>Michael Moore, the maverick documentary filmmaker who has been a chief Nader cheerleader, rebutted this argument at the Minnesota rally by asking what would have happened if Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks had also decided to accept the status quo in case things got worse. </p> <p>\"A vote for Nader is a political Molotov - throw it into the voting booth,\" said Moore. </p> <p>But if Mr Nader is having problems capturing the magical double-digit support level, his nearest third-party rivals are floundering in his wake. </p> <p>Pat Buchanan, the renegade rightwing Republican who won the Reform party nomination in a messy battle at its Long Beach convention in August, is barely registering 1% in the polls. </p> <p>The adoption of a black vice-presidential running-mate, Ezola Foster - a supporter, bizarrely, of the far-right John Birch Society, has done little to win Mr Buchanan credibility. His platform is essentially anti-UN, anti-immigration, anti-world trade, anti-abortion and anti-\"Republicrats\", as he now calls the two main parties. </p> <p>Overtaking Mr Buchanan now in states such as Georgia, Illinois and Colorado, is the Libertarian party's Harry Browne, a 67-year-old Tennessee-based investment analyst who also ran in 1996. His message is straightforward and, superficially, extremely appealing to most voters: no more income tax. </p> <p>He also reaches other constituencies with a promise of an end to the \"war on drugs\", believing in a person's right to do what they like in their own home. Mr Browne backs the repeal of all gun-control legislation and the removal of all American troops from foreign countries. </p> <p>But, Mr Nader, Mr Buchanan, Mr Browne and the two other better-known alternative candidates - John Hagelin of the Natural Law party - and Howard Phillips of the Constitutional party - all know their chances of having their voices heard above the sound of the multi-million dollar Gore-Bush battle are slim.</p>",

  "The Clinton administration was scrambling yesterday to salvage something from its eight-year attempt to forge a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, as prospects for a deal appeared to evaporate in the smoke rising from the occupied territories. <p>The White House announced it would chair a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian security officials to discuss the roots of the violence in an attempt to prevent further clashes. The national security council spokesman, PJ Crowley, said the meeting would take place somewhere in the region \"as soon as conditions permit\". </p> <p>He added that US security experts would take part to \"see how both parties can ensure that the Palestinian and Israeli people do not relive the terrible events of the last few days\". </p> <p>The meeting was proposed in the course of a hectic weekend of damage limitation by US leaders. Mr Clinton telephoned the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, on Saturday, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, the next day. </p> <p>According to Mr Crowley, the president expressed his concern over the course of events, conveyed his condolences to the families of the dead, and called for calm. </p> <p>The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, also called officials on both sides of the conflict in an attempt to prevent any further escalation. </p> <p>In Washington, however, there was a growing sense of helplessness and resignation over prospects for a permanent Middle East settlement, a diplomatic coup which the White House had hoped would be Mr Clinton's crowning foreign policy achievement. Although he will remain in office until January 20, he will have little authority to pursue a Middle East peace agreement after the November 7 presidential elections. </p> <p>The administration, normally anxious not to apportion blame, could not hide its anger with Ariel Sharon, the Israeli opposition leader whose visit last Thursday to the Muslim holy site in Jerusalem, Haram al-Sharif, sparked the current wave of rioting. </p> <p>Ms Albright called the visit counter-productive while the White House spokesman Jake Siewert said of the Sharon visit \"We've said that was not helpful, and we've urged everyone to exercise good judgment, avoid provocative acts and respect, particularly, that site.\" </p> <p>Before the violence erupted, US officials believed they had a fighting chance of reaching an elusive compromise over Jerusalem's future. Trilateral talks in July at Camp David ground to a halt over the fate of Jerusalem, and particularly over who would control the Haram al-Sharif (known to Jews as the Temple Mount), which is sacred to both religions. But both sides had promised to continue to explore the limits of compromise over the highly emotive issue. </p> <p>Last month, US diplomats had floated a number of \"bridging proposals\" including one plan under which the holy sites would be under UN control. But such a compromise would have involved political risks for Mr Barak and Mr Arafat. Their scope for taking such risks has now narrowed considerably, Middle East analysts agreed yesterday. </p> <p>\"This is not just another outburst of violence,\" Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington, told the New York Times. \"This will have the most profound effect on the Israeli public ... This opens some very old books.\" </p> <p>According to the New York Times, the Clinton administration compiled a summary of the conflicting positions 10 days ago, together with the bridging proposals. However, rather than present the document as a fait accompli , the White House invited the top Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington, in an attempt to make some headway. The emissaries made little progress and left the US on Thursday, the day Mr Sharon made his controversial visit to the Haram al-Sharif.</p>",
  "<b> Jerusalem Post</b> <br> <p> Yasser Arafat is once again attempting to negotiate with violence. The supposed reason for the Palestinian riots - Likud leader Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount on Thursday - should be dismissed outright ... Violence of the scope recently seen - the worst rioting since 1996 - is effectively an act of will by the Palestinian leadership, for which Sharon's visit at most provided a convenient rallying cry </p> <p><b> Ha'aretz (Israel)</b><br> </p> <p> Whoever expected Palestinian restraint in the wake of the visit to the Temple Mount is probably the same person who hoped to see rational restraint throughout the days of the vacillating diplomatic negotiations between the two sides ... The struggle between the Islamic strands and the Palestinian Authority ... has been ongoing, and every time a conflagration occurs, questions arise anew about the level of control exercised by Yasser Arafat. </p> <p><b> Bahrain Tribune</b><br> </p> <p> The world may be hearing new talk on \"Israeli commitment to peace\" but, alas, the world is seeing old, familiar scenes of a distorted, often brutal, violence-laden policy of subjugation that Israel continues to wield in occupied Jerusalem ... It seems the matter has been thrown wide open once more as doubts are raised anew on Israel's genuine commitment to peace. While everyone is wondering if authentic concessions would be made over occupied Jerusalem, Israeli bullets are already giving a hint that probably there would be none. </p> <p><b> Syria Times</b><br> </p> <p> The entire American approach towards the peace process no longer seems promising.

  "The rules of engagement used by the Israeli Defence Force and the border police in the occupied territories have always been something of a mystery. It has never been clear if a systematic set of rules existed, let alone whether they were followed in the heat of civil unrest. <p>During the 1987-93 intifada (uprising) evidence emerged that undercover Israeli units were operating under a shoot-to-kill policy and were carrying out summary executions on suspected instigators of the riots. A 1993 report by Human Rights Watch alleged that 120 Palestinians had been killed by these squads operating in disguise among the protesters. </p> <p>A report by the US state department during the intifada noted that although the IDF was supposed to have rules of engagement which limited the use of force, these guidelines \"often were not followed, resulting in avoidable deaths and injuries.\" </p> <p>Since the intifada, the Israeli security forces have frequently used live ammunition against Palestinian demonstrators in the West Bank and Gaza despite the absence of firearms on the Palestinian side, producing a steady stream of deaths among the shabab - the young men at the forefront of the protests. </p> <p>The IDF does not disclose its rules of engagement as a matter of policy, presumably so that Palestinian rioters could not be sure of the threshold of violence which would draw a lethal response. However, the army and the border police frequently defend the use of live fire by arguing that their troops had been under threat. </p> <p>For observers, it has been hard to distinguish which circumstances would trigger live fire from Israeli lines, and which would evoke the Israeli version of rubber bullets - normally a metal ball bearing covered in a layer of black rubber quite capable of causing lethal injuries. </p> <p>There have been few cases over the years in which Israeli soldiers have been prosecuted for shooting Palestinian protesters, and there has been scant pressure from the Israeli media for public investigations. A soldier is much more likely to face a court-martial for allowing his weapon to be taken from him than for opening fire in a tense situation. </p> <p>Soldiers are forbidden under any circumstances from opening fire on Jewish settlers. The fact emerged in the course of an enquiry into the 1994 massacre of Muslim worshippers at a Hebron mosque. A border police superintendent told the commission of enquiry that soldiers would have been unable to prevent the killings because of the rules of engagement.</p>",
  "When Ariel Sharon, the bulldozer of Israeli politics, marched up to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem last Thursday accompanied by hundreds of riot police, he was - as he put it - merely exercising the right of every Jew to visit the holiest site in Judaism. <p>But was it a pilgrimage or a provocation? Yesterday, governments around the world appeared to have little doubt as they heaped condemnation on Israel's hardline opposition leader. </p> <p>The 45 minutes that the former army general - described in an Israeli newspaper as a \"connoisseur of non-kosher foods\" - spent exercising his religious rights sparked five days of bloody violence in which scores of people, mostly Palestinians, have died. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's dramatic gesture appears to have been calculated to embarrass Mr Barak and to reinforce his own position as leader of the Likud party in the face of a likely challenge from the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. </p> <p>Mr Netanyahu's path to a political comeback was cleared last Wednesday when the Israeli attorney general decided not to prosecute him for alleged corruption. </p> <p>Mr Sharon claimed on television that his visit was meant to demonstrate that no Israeli needs ask for permission to visit sovereign Israeli territory. But Israeli governments - including those in which Mr Sharon served - have always been conscious of the sensitivity of the site and have tried to keep Jewish extremists away. </p> <p>One theory advanced by a western diplomatic source yesterday was that Mr Sharon may have expected Israeli security forces to turn him away from the site - which would have allowed him to accuse Mr Barak of surrendering sovereignty over the area. </p> <p>Besides infuriating Palestinians, Mr Sharon's visit appears to have caused offence to pious Jews. An article in Ha'aretz newspaper yesterday accused him of desecrating the holy site by visiting it without taking a ritual bath beforehand or changing into non-leather shoes. </p> <p>Mr Sharon yesterday insisted: \"It was not my visit to the Temple Mount that ignited the disturbances.\" He said the riots were \"part of an overall campaign planned in advance\", which had begun about 10 days ago near Gaza, and had spread to Jerusalem. </p> <p>Several Israeli officials have lent their support to this claim, suggesting that some of the Palestinians - with or without the connivance of their leaders - were looking for an opportunity to cause trouble, and that Mr Sharon provided it. </p> <p>\"Sharon was (in the best case) not the cause of the disturbances but rather a pretext for them,\" an article in Ha'aretz newspaper said yesterday. \"Instead of lighting the fire, he gave the Palestinians the match. The question remains: Why did he do it?\" </p> <p>As far as the international community was concerned, Mr Sharon deserved and received widespread condemnation. In addition to the criticism levelled by individual countries, France, the current holder of the European presidency, issued a statement on behalf of the EU. \"The European Union is very concerned by the continuation of bloody confrontations in Jerusalem and in the territories and dismayed by the number of victims,\" it said. The European Union urges all those responsible on both sides to take all necessary measures to stop the violence and avoid new provocations.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Palestinian observer at the UN protested to the organisation about Mr Sharon's visit and called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from east Jerusalem and the vicinity of all Palestinian cities. </p> <p>Mr Sharon is regarded by some Israelis as a hero and by others as a super hawk. Almost anything he says or does is liable to inflame Palestinian feelings because of his bloodstained past. </p> <p>Born at Kfar Malal in 1928 to a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 family, he grew up on a cooperative farm in western Palestine under British rule. </p> <p>In 1953 he founded and led the notorious \"Unit 101\" commando unit which carried out retaliatory raids against Arab \"infiltrators\". In one infamous instance, 69 civilians (most of them women and children) were killed by accident in Qibya, a Jordanian village. </p> <p>He commanded an armoured division during the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars, and was first elected to the knesset (Israeli parliament) in 1973. In 1982, he masterminded the invasion of Lebanon, sending the Israelis into Beirut to drive out the Palestine Liberation Organisation. </p> <p>In the process, hundreds of Palestinians in refugee camps un der Israeli control were massacred by Lebanese Christian militiamen. An Israeli tribunal found Mr Sharon indirectly responsible for the killings. </p> <p>Mr Sharon has held numerous government posts, beginning with special security adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He later served as minister of agriculture, defence, trade and industry, housing, and national infrastructure, before becoming foreign minister in Mr Netanyahu's government. </p> <p>As housing minister in the early 1990s, he presided over a huge drive to build Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. While some Israeli politicians were coy about the true purpose of the policy, Mr Sharon openly proclaimed it as an at tempt to create facts on the ground and make territorial compromises with the Palestinians - or the establishment of a Palestinian state - more difficult. </p> <p>He strongly opposed the interim Oslo peace agreement of 1993 as \"a moral error of the first order\" and has described the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat as a \"war criminal\". </p> <p>In 1998, he helped to secure the release of two Mossad agents arrested in Jordan for attempting to poison Khaled Meshal, a leader of the Islamic militant group, Hamas. Interviewed on Jordanian television, he assured viewers that Israel would make further attempts to kill Mr Meshal, though he added: \"I can tell you that we won't do it on your soil.\"</p>",
  "John Major last night rebuked William Hague for lurching to the right when he warned that the Tories are failing to appeal to voters \"outside the circle of rising prosperity\". <p>In his first conference speech since leaving Downing Street, the former prime minister flew the flag for the Tories' beleaguered \"one nation\" wing with a powerful appeal to the leadership to recapture the centre ground. </p> <p>At a fringe meeting organised by Conservative Mainstream, a group set up by Michael Heseltine to oppose the drift to the right, Mr Major went out of his way to praise his successor for reaching out to middle Britain more effectively than any other party. </p> <p>But the former prime minister pointedly added: \"That isn't enough. We must reach out to all. The people in slums, the people in need, the people outside the circle of rising prosperity, the black and brown and yellow Britons who are as much a part of our society as I am. Our policies and our party are as much for them as for anyone else.\" </p> <p>His remarks underlined Mr Major's growing frustration with Mr Hague's flirtation with the right over asylum seekers and law and order. Mr Major has told friends that he believes that some of Mr Hague's more provocative pronouncements mark a worrying departure from the \"one nation\" Toryism he tried to promote in Downing Street. </p> <p>The former prime minister angrily denied reports over the weekend that he was planning to use his last conference appearance as an MP to criticise Mr Hague. </p> <p>However, his remarks about \"people in slums\" was a clear sign of his unease. Mr Major qualified his criticisms by applauding the Tory leadership for its eleventh hour conversion to \"one nation\" Toryism. </p> <p>The words \"mainstream majority\" are the buzzwords of this week's conference in Bournemouth as Mr Hague attempts to appeal to middle of the road voters who were put off by his provocative interventions on asylum seekers and on law and order. </p> <p>Mr Major made clear that he would examine the new raft of policies carefully to ensure they measure up to his one nation beliefs. </p> <p>\"This week there are a range of inclusive policies to be announced,\" Mr Major said. \"I hope they will prove effective to people in every part of the country and from every background. </p> <p>\"We must not allow ourselves to be falsely labelled by our opponents. We are the party that stands for one nation.\" Mr Major received a rapturous reception in Bournemouth yesterday as he entered the main conference hall for the opening ceremony, accompanied by his wife Dame Norma. </p> <p>The Majors were embraced enthusiastically by Mr Hague and his wife Ffion, a year after the Tory leadership attempted to airbrush the former prime minister out of history. </p> <p>In his speech the notoriously sensitive former prime minister showed that he still bore scars from his premiership. </p> <p>\"Certainly some MPs in our party did us great harm,\" Mr Major said in a reference to the likes of Neil Hamilton who associated the party with allegations of sleaze. </p> <p>But he said that it was unfair to \"hang individual misdemeanours around the neck of a political party\" led by the likes of Douglas Hurd, Michael Heseltine and Ken Clarke. His praise of Mr Clarke, who wastes no time in lambasting Mr Hague's leadership, was seen as a none too subtle hint that the former chancellor should be given a frontline role. Mr Clarke's friends have called for him to be given a shadow cabinet post. </p> <p>Mr Major also made no mention of the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, who will forever be seen by Mr Major as one of his \"bastard\" ministers. </p> <p>Mr Major's criticism of the leadership was echoed by the former transport minister Steve Norris, who said the Tories must do more to appeal to members of ethnic minorities. \"None of us would wish to belong to a party which was not there to appeal to everyone equally in our society, whether ther are male or female, rich or poor, black or white, gay or straight,\" he told a fringe meeting.</p>",
  "\u0095 Believing in Britain, the Tories' rallying cry for the week, marks a determined effort by William Hague to reclaim the union flag from Tony Blair. Party apparatchiks only agreed on the slogan to launch Hague's tilt at No 10 after a Central Office row over two alternatives. The first, Ambitious for Britain, was judged too \"young man\" for Hague by advisers who feared the Tory leader would sound vacuous. The second, Ready to Govern, invited unfavourable com parisons with David Steel's ill-judged advice to Alliance activists in the eighties to return to their constituencies and prepare for government. So the Tories plumped for Believing in Britain and, in an historic bit of dithering, Hague yesterday used the others during interviews. <p>\u0095 How far big business has deserted the Tories is evident from a stroll through Willieville. With 75 stands, the Conservative exhibition area is smaller than that of the Liberal Democrats a fortnight ago, and less than half the size of Labour last week ,with Virgin, Transco and Railtrack among those not bothering to make the Bournemouth pilgrimage. The total would be even more pathetic if it had not been inflated by 13 party sites. </p> <p>\u0095 Euro MP Bill Newton-Dunn has become the man with no name, airbrushed out in true Stalinist style. The Tory whip in Brussels was mysteriously withdrawn last week after he challenged Hague's bid to make 3p on or off a litre of petrol the fundamental dividing line in British politics. Alas a stand for Willieville, listing 36 Conservative Euro MPs, was already built and paid for. Yesterday it contained 35 names and one strip of white paper. </p> <p>\u0095 More on that funky 3D set intended to give a disco edge to a party more at home with tea dances. The backdrop was designed by Michael Lockett who last sprung to public prominence over his role organising the millennium dome's very successful (not) opening night. Sir Humphrey told Jim Hacker in Yes, Minister that if he had a good speech to make it against a plain background and a bad one in front of many shapes to distract the audience. </p> <p>\u0095 This week's diary U-turn competition has opened and closed after the Sun, which two conferences ago portrayed Hague as a dead parrot, yesterday urged readers not to underestimate him.</p>",

  "Robbie Williams' latest album may be called Sing When You're Winning, but there was little evidence of either yesterday when the former Take That star lost an expensive copyright battle. <p>The New York-based Ludlow Music took Williams to court to claim that Jesus in a Camper Van, a track on his 1998 album I've Been Expecting You which he co-wrote with Guy Chambers, relied too heavily on the 1961 song I am the Way by Woody Guthrie and a 1973 adaptation by the US country singer Loudon Wainwright III. </p> <p>Yesterday at the high court in London, the deputy judge Nicholas Strauss QC ruled that Ludlow is entitled to \"substantial\" and possibly even exemplary damages from Williams. Damages were also awarded against Chambers, and Williams's record company EMI Music Publishing and BMG Music Publishing. </p> <p>The amount which will be decided at a later date, is expected to run into six figures as Williams's album sold about 2.4m copies. </p> <p>Ludlow Music owns the copyright to the original Woody Guthrie number and, with its permission, Loudon Wainwright composed what the judge yesterday described as a parody called I am the Way (New York Town), assigning his copyright to Ludlow. </p> <p>The judge said that in late 1997 or early 1998, Williams and Chambers co-wrote Jesus in a Camper Van and EMI and BMG had acquired copyright of it. </p> <p>He said the Woody Guthrie original included the line: \"Every good man gets a little hard luck sometimes.\" Loudon Wainwright's song carried the line: \"Every son of God gets a little hard luck sometimes, especially when he goes round saying he is the way.\" </p> <p>The Williams and Chambers song contained the lines: \"I suppose even the son of God gets it hard sometimes, especially when he goes round saying I am the way.\" </p> <p>Ludlow Music had initially given the go-ahead for the Williams and Chambers song but a dispute had arisen over their demand for a half share of the copyright. They were not satisfied with an offer of 25%. </p> <p>EMI declined to increase the offer and was asked in court documents to delete all references to the Ludlow Music song. The judge said that despite this the album wrongly stated that the lyrics had been reproduced \"by kind permission\" of Ludlow. </p> <p>He said Williams, Chambers, EMI and BMG accepted they used elements of the I am the Way (New York Town) but denied they had used what could, in the eyes of the law, be regarded as a \"substantial part\". </p> <p>But the judge said: \"In my view, the extent of the copying is substantial, although not by much.\" He said that quantitatively, one out of four verses had been copied. </p> <p>He added: \"Jesus in a Camper Van takes the central idea from I am the Way (New York Town), namely that the son of God attracts bad luck by going round saying 'I am the way' and embodies it in virtually identical words. </p> <p>\"I think that this is of sufficient substance to amount to an infringement of copyright.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Williams heads the nominations for this year's MTV Europe Music awards.

  "<p>The following information is classified: TOP SECRET. Name: JACQUES PERETTI. Sex: MALE. Age: TOO OLD TO BE WATCHING CAMP RERUNS OF BIONIC WOMAN. Past Life: PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER. Critical Injury: SKY-DIVING ACCIDENT. Anatomical Damage: BOTH LEGS. RIGHT ARM. RIGHT EAR. </p> <p>Right ear? How on earth did Lindsay Wagner, playing the pretentiously named Jaime Sommers: world tennis champion, girlfriend of Six Million Dollar Man Steve Austin, manage to snag her right ear in a sky-diving accident? Fall awkwardly on a log? The CIA, FBI, UNICEF and IKEA were all quick on the scene, whisking Jaime to a TOP SECRET hospital where she underwent emergency TOP SECRET surgery. </p> <p>The bionic rebuilding of Lindsay Wagner was the first step for Universal Studios on the road to the creation of a Bionic Family, complete with Bionic Boy and even a Bionic Dog. First introduced in The Six Million Dollar Man as female love interest for Steve Austin, America was horrified when, after just two episodes, Jaime was killed off (falling fatally on that right ear). </p> <p>Hastily, Universal cooked-up a spin-off series, The Bionic Woman, repackaging the death episode from the Six Million Dollar man as episode one of Bionic Woman. </p> <p>Typical of fondly remembered cult drama from the mid 70s, the action is slower and more wooden than we choose to recall. Jaime spends a lot of time gazing wistfully through windows at autumnal trees, negotiating her catastrophically wide flares through clumps of trees, or visiting more trees on which she and Steve carved their names: JAIME 4 STEVE. </p> <p>Occasionally, Jaime explodes into action: a blur of 1,000mph housework, dusting every surface in three seconds flat. The Bionic Woman was more Genetically-Modified Housewife than super-agent, piercing tin cans with her immaculate fingernails. </p> <p>In the mid 70s, TV had much lower standards for superheroes. Catching one's lapel on barbed wire could jeopardise an entire mission. Lee Majors was clearly unfit to run for a bus, let alone safeguard the freedom of the western world. </p> <p>The Cold War locked the superpowers in rather dull stasis. When Lindsay Wagner was rebuilt, there were no out-of-control Ayatollahs or Milosevic types, thinly disguised by moustache and invented country, to karate punch. Hence, Jaime's portfolio covered a bewilderingly wide selection of alternative missions: from saving pet lions to foiling dishonest hairdressers. </p> <p>As ludicrous and dull as The Bionic shows were, they predated a host of 80s sci-fi movies including Japanese art mutation-fantasy Tetsuo and the Terminator movies. In \"Fembots In Las Vegas\" Jaime faced an army of deadly female robots bent on capturing an \"energy ray weapon\" (to use its technical name). Jaime undertook her high-risk mission from Ventura Air Force Base in California. </p> <p>Both Fembots and Ventura became cult words for lovers of TV kitsch: The Fembots were revived by Mike Myers for Austin Powers; and Ventura - a silly name used by a host of writers on campy mid-70s mini series as an in-joke - was revived by Jim Carrey for Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. </p> <p>Bionic Woman, rooted in the mid 70s, reflected the paranoia and secrecy of post-Watergate America: the obsession with classified information and bugging rooms with strategically placed bowls of flowers. As a result of Nixon, American daytime audiences gained an appetite for mini-series with surprisingly labyrinthine plots about counter-espionage and double-identities. </p> <p>Lindsay Wagner's character is modelled on the strongest female icon of the era, Chris Evert. Questioned by government agents after the fatal ear accident, Jaime is shown stills of Billy Jean King in order to jog her memory. The therapy works, as she begins to piece together the past: shiny peach lipgloss flashbacks of frolicking through the woods with a paunchy Steve Austin, bangs blowing in the wind like a flotilla at Cowes Week. </p> <p>The most important influence on Bionic Woman, however, was not Chris Evert but The Fugitive, American television's template of existentialist angst. The Fugitive - a man on the run, trapped in a never-ending dark night of the soul - found a new lease of life in Bionic Woman's contemporary, The Incredible Hulk. </p> <p>Hulk, like The Bionic Woman, suffers \"flashes of pain\" - loss of memory, brought on by sudden trauma. It wouldn't take a therapist long to access the link between the schizophrenia of mid-70s America and the explosion of shows with identity-crisis at their heart. Hulk is ultimately doomed to wander the earth alone, but Jaime's malaise is cured by technology - more particularly, military hardware. </p> <p>The obsession with superhuman powers could at some cod psychological level be said to be a response to the governmental crisis in post-Nixon America, but the truth is probably more to do with good old girl power. Both Charlie's Angels and Bionic Woman aired in 1976, planting small Baader-Meinhof groups of high-kicking women in the heart of the schedule. Suddenly, American television was dominated by female traffic wardens and school teachers with a secret life, taking orders from past-it sugar daddies in big leather swivel-chairs. </p> <p>There was enough subordination there to make men still feel nominally in charge, but the balance was clearly shifting. In the 80s, women could stop pretending to be little ladies with a double life, throwing the ocassional tennis racket six miles, and square up to the enemy without the aid of bionics. It was progress, of course, but then came Knight Rider. </p> <p>The Bionic Woman, today, 11am &amp; 6pm, sci-fi channel.</p>",
  "<p>Beams of orange sunlight pierce the sodden gloom of the forest, casting slanting shadows among the tall, mossy trunks. The light falls on a little sandy hollow deep in the trees, a sudden patch of luminous warmth in the sullen grey air. What is this - Country Diary? Harken to the cry of the capercaillie and the distant noise of a blundering elk. Here's an unusual species of lichen. No - the forest is silent and dead, a model on a vitrine, standing on a plinth in Birmingham's Ikon Gallery. The twinkling dewdrops on the branches are air bubbles, the heavy mist in the tank a solution of milky acrylic and salt water. </p> <p>There is something magical and disturbing about Mariele Neudecker's model worlds and, pressing your nose to the glass, you might almost be in that dank forest, alert to every snapping twig. It's just like that Judder Man advert, the Blair Witch Project, Red Riding Hood and every scary folk tale that made you dive under the duvet, squirming in delighted horror. The imagery of the deep dark wood is a staple of our imaginations: think Wind in the Willows, Teddy Bear's Picnic, Twin Peaks and Deliverance. If the wood sprites and witches don't get you, some hillbilly with a squint and a squirrel-gun will. </p> <p>Neudecker's I Don't Know How I Resisted the Urge to Run is like a chapter title for a story you can make up yourself, from the woodpile of received imagery. This may take something away from the magic, but instead it actually adds to it, heaping on the layers. We know where we are, what this is about. All we have to do is supply our own bogeyman: a backwoods serial killer, a bloodthirsty bear, an old lady with a wart on her nose. </p> <p>That's the thing about cliches - one size fits all. The vitrine has become a commonplace, too, if not an artistic cliche: Joseph Beuys's vitrines, with their arrangements of forlorn detritus and potent little objects; Jeff Koons's shiny, hermetically-sealed display cabinets (from the mid-1980s) with their brand-new vacuum cleaners; Damien Hirst's vitrines, the Chapman brothers' Hell, their model inferno in Apocalypse... The vitrine is like a picture frame, a container for another world, itself displayed within the larger box of the gallery. </p> <p>While Hirst's tanks have a sort of overblown sculptural status in their own right, Beuys's glass containers always stayed close to the museum display cabinet, while remaining little theatres of the imagination. Beuys's choice of objects (rusty tin cans, razor blades, grease-stained cardboard boxes, lumps of fat and props from his performances) gave his vitrine works the air of reliquaries. His walking stick was like a bishop's mitre, his hat and fishing vest the priestly vestments of a one-man religion. One would never be surprised, looking into a Beuys vitrine, to find St Agatha's preserved breasts, like shrivelled figs, or the mummified fingers of St Thomas, wrapped in gauze. </p> <p>Looking into Neudecker's vitrines, like looking into the Chapmans' multi-part Hell, is a lot like watching TV; we suspend our sense of our own scale in relation to the model in the tank. This, too, was one of the functions of the otherwise merely unfashionable and ostentatious glazed and gilded frames Francis Bacon used on his paintings. Like the proscenium arch, the frame and the glazed box cue our theatrical suspension of disbelief. Like the picture frame, the vitrine is in fact a device with an old-fashioned purpose: to remove the object under scrutiny from the everyday world, the laws of time and place. It obeys instead another law, that of artistic and museological displacement. </p> <p>Neudecker's work is supremely conscious of this - presenting us with a world at a remove, a kind of wondrous 3D picture. It is, frequently, a picturesque or gothic sublime, often based on an even earlier picture, and often derived from the Romantic paintings of Caspar David Friedrich. She re-creates misty forests, mountainscapes, tumbles of rock and scree, peaks and valleys in miniature. All that's missing is the pondering subject, the figure in the painting to witness the scene and give it its sense of scale, immeasurable distance and magnitude. We wonder, too, at the artifice with which Neudecker creates an illusory geography as much as we do at the meaning of them. Up close to her vitrines, we happily - willingly - choose to forget we are in a nicely-heated art gallery, and imagine ourselves in the forest or high mountain pass with Friedrich, or on a ship at the edge of an ice-floe, with Coleridge's Ancient Mariner. </p> <p>There are several vitrines in Neudecker's solo show at the Ikon. One contains a snowy alpine landscape, a series of high passes, valleys and gorges, with some kind of church or chimney on one mountain, a cross atop the highest peak across the valley. Our own scale seems infinitesimal. Yet another mountainscape is perched above our heads, on a plinth whose high-angled sides resemble Edwin Lutyens's Whitehall Cenotaph. I've never been on an alp, having only ever flown over them - the view is wondrous enough, but always feels somehow undeserved, and therefore a little unreal. </p> <p>The vitrines are Neudecker's best-known works, and a winning formula. But, thankfully, she knows how to go beyond them. Her model of light coming in through a gothic window - the light rendered, as though in an engraving, but executed in hundreds of stretched lengths of nylon monofilament fishing line that fan through the window and down to the floor - is too much a demonstration model to be entirely successful. </p> <p>Her 3D model of the strange anamorphic skull in Holbein's National Gallery painting The Ambassadors - constructed using medical scans, laser technology and computer modelling, and measured from a real skull - is a fascinating, oddly contorted object. It casts a near perfectly proportioned shadow: a clever, rhetorical aside to the debate about the skull in Holbein's painting. </p> <p>Projected on two side-by-side screens, we see two views of the same mountain range. The sound of a dreadful wind howls through the gallery. Clouds pass over the peaks and fill the valleys. In the middle distance, the cross on the peak stands resolute against the weather. The world turns white. As the storm passes, blue sky glimmers over the mountains, a watery turquoise on one screen, a deeper infinite blue on the other. </p> <p>The world regains its colour, but, as the clouds disperse, vague reflections of pillars appear in the sky, till the dry-ice storm encroaches again. Showing us - albeit briefly and sparingly - the mechanics of the illusion doesn't diminish the sense of wonder. Nor is this revelation the point of the piece. I don't know what the point is, exactly, except that it flips us out of the illusion we've so readily accepted, and go on accepting once the weather closes in again on what are, after all, knee-high peaks. </p> <p>The last, and in some ways most beguiling work in the show is, again, filmed. A sunset is projected on one side of a free-hanging screen, a sunrise on the other. The sunset was filmed in the Azores, the sunrise at the southern tip of Australia. Both were shot at the same time, the two film crews linked by satellite phone. The two locations are true antipodes and, as the sun dips below the horizon in the Atlantic, it heaves up over the Pacific. </p> <p>How can this be, we ask ourselves, and is this really true? I take it on trust, as I walk around the screen, passing from approaching night to dawning day, making my own circumnavigation of a mental world. Why, I ask, having read the catalogue notes, was the work filmed over four days? Are these the same simultaneous sunsets and sunrises? Does it matter? Oscar Wilde, if I remember, thought sunsets were vulgar. Rosy-fingered dawns are a kind of cliche, too. The turn of the earth, and its revolution around the sun, is a constant condition rather than an event. </p> <p>Neudecker's Another Day reminds us of the world's true scale in relation to human metaphor, and our need for a sense of beginnings and endings. A sense of wonder is undoubtedly necessary, along with a sense of proportion. </p> <p>Until Now is at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (0121-248 0708), till November 12.</p>",
  "Parents who lose touch with their children because childcare cases are mishandled by social workers will have a new right to claim damages for \"loss of relationship\" under the Human Rights Act, the law commission for England and Wales and the Scottish law commission say in a report today. <p>The act, which came into force yesterday, incorporates the European convention on human rights into UK law and allows UK courts for the first time to award damages for breach of the convention. Courts will have to take account of case law from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg in taking decisions on damages. </p> <p>The two official law reform bodies conclude that there will be no need for major change to the law on damages. But in a few cases where British law does not recognise a right to damages, the courts will have to remedy this. </p> <p>A striking example recognised by the Strasbourg court, but not by the British courts, is the loss of love, companionship and support when a relationship, such as that of parent and child, is disrupted. There has been a series of cases in Strasbourg brought by parents of children in care complaining that procedures violated their right to a fair hearing (article six of the European convention) or respect for family life (article eight). </p> <p>In one case, a mother was denied access to her child in care. She applied for access but there were delays and the child was eventually adopted. The mother was awarded \u00a312,000 even though the local government ombudsman thought it unlikely the outcome would have been different had the local authority acted more quickly. </p> <p>The Strasbourg court said the mother was the victim of a \"procedural deficiency\" but it was one \"that was intimately connected with an interference with one of the most fundamental of rights, namely that of respect for family life\". </p> <p>In another case, a mother whose children were in care a long way from her home, and whose access was restricted with no means of challenge, won more than \u00a318,000 and her daughter more than \u00a39,000. </p> <p>\"The UK courts will need to fashion a remedy which is just and appropriate and which affords just satisfaction to the victim,\" says the report. \"As they must take account the principles used by the Strasbourg court, we would expect them to award compensation in such cases.\"</p>",
  "In 1996 a small show opened in a small theatre in the West End of London. Its credentials seemed to guarantee that it would close before the ink dried on the - very mixed - reviews. <p>It was a translation of a contemporary French play of ideas, acted by three middle-aged men on a minimal set with one white prop. It had no sex, no songs, and it was all over in 90 minutes. </p> <p>\"There's no trick, it's a great night out - I think it's that simple,\" the producer, David Pugh, says to a theatre world clamouring to be let in on his secret. </p> <p>The play was Art, and next week it celebrates its fourth anniversary at Wyndhams Theatre. It is an astounding West End run for a straight play, dealing with the destruction of a triangular friendship when one man invests a small fortune on a plain canvas. </p> <p>The play has been a worldwide success, but nothing has touched the London run. Groups of friends come to watch a rare play dealing with male friendship. Groups of acting friends come and apply as a gang to play the parts: Stephen Tomkinson, star of Ballykissangel, came because his friend Neil Pearson, co-star in Drop the Dead Donkey, said he had to see it, and duly appeared in the 14th cast. </p> <p>Art clearly has a winning formula, but nobody - including the author, Yasmina Reza - has been able to duplicate it. Famously, when she accepted the Evening Standard award for best comedy, she said she was puzzled because she thought she had written a tragedy. The awards audience took this as a splendid joke; show insiders say she meant every word of it. </p> <p>John Godber, who also has an armlock on British popular taste with plays like such as Bouncers and Up and Under, claims not to have seen Art. However two years ago, as founder, director and chief playwright for Hull Truck theatre company, he launched a competition to find a new play which \"must be suitable to be performed by four male actors; it should require minimal set; it should be theatrically exciting.\" He is yet to find it. </p> <p>Maggie Smith is among the divas said to be interested in an all-women version. Reza has turned the idea down flat. </p> <p>One notable cast was Patrick Duffy, who played Bobby Ewing of Dallas, Richard Thomas, who was John-Boy in The Waltons, and Paul Freeman. Another is the 16th, due to take over in three weeks: Warren Mitchell, Ken Campbell and John Fortune. </p> <p>The collision of the immortal Alf Garnett with Ken Campbell, notorious for his Roadshow performances in pubs and clubs, which continued into the small hours until the audience whimpered for mercy, and that most dryly British of satirists, John Fortune, could be epic. </p> <p>\"Keeping it going was a sort of joke originally,\" David Pugh said. \"The first cast, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and Ken Stott, was so fantastic that everyone said once they're gone you're finished, mate. So the huge challenge was to get a great second cast, and then we just kept doing it.\" </p> <p>He tries to cast friends who will enjoy working together: the planned first cast was Finney, Courtenay and their drinking mate Michael Gambon. By the time Christopher Hampton's classy translation was finished, Gambon was on Broadway. Pugh cast another old friend, Ken Stott, a rock-solid actor who never quite made A-team status. Since Art he has become the rumpled and twitchy policeman star of two BBC series of Vice. </p> <p>Some people come to see the show so often they become familiar faces. Michael King, who has probably seen Art more often than anyone, says it is a different experience every time. He has seen 11 of the casts to date and will be back for the new boys. </p> <p>Stars are now queueing up to appear in Pugh's show. The actors who play Frasier and his neurotic brother and cranky father in the US sitcom have been struggling for two years to clear a gap in their schedules to appear in Art. </p> <p>It was the first play the lugubrious comedian Jack Dee appeared in, and he came back for a second run. It was the West End debut of fellow comedian Frank Skinner, and the return to ensemble acting of the matinee star Nigel Havers. </p> <p>It has given instant straight acting credentials to other comedians, including Chris Langham and the current stars Sean Hughes and Alistair McGowan (the third is Colin Buchanan). </p> <p>It has also provided a quick burst of West End popular adulation to regiments of former Hamlets, Romeos and Richards from the Royal Shakespeare and National Theatres, including Anton Lesser and Roger Allam. </p> <p>Every actor gets paid \u00a33,000 a week, good money for some of the younger actors, petty cash for the megastars such as Stacy Keach, and less than Jack Dee would get for a 20-minute after dinner speech. </p> <p>Pugh's running wish list is scribbled on a blackboard, originally owned by his father, a Stoke-on-Trent schoolmaster. Current top of the blackboard is Ardal O'Hanlan, though his obvious running mate, Dermot Morgan, Father Ted himself, has died. </p> <p>Pugh is enthusiastic about the casting opportunities promised by the US actors' strike, which may virtually shut down film and TV drama production early next year. </p> <p>There is one obvious name that has never appeared on Pugh's blackboard, a bankable British megastar who might hanker for a brief return to his theatrical roots. Sean Connery is not available. He is, however, the show's co-producer. </p> <p>It was his wife, Micheline, who saw the show in Paris and, convinced there was a part for him, persuaded him to buy the overseas rights. He decided not to take a role - he is very much a star who prefers to shine alone rather than in a constellation - but it has proved a remarkably canny investment.</p> <p><br><b> Who has been who in the Art world</b><br></p> <p>\u0095 Richard Thomas starred as Yvan from April 25 to July 16 2000.

  "Pat Pottle, the veteran anti-war campaigner who has died aged 62, will be remembered most for helping the Soviet spy George Blake to escape from prison in 1966, in one of the most astonishing jailbreaks in British history. <p>For years it was put about by an embarrassed security establishment that Blake's escape had been the result of a cunning plot engineered by the KGB. Indeed, so humiliating was the escapade that the security services took no action, even when they suspected, only weeks after the event, that it was the work of Pottle, his fellow campaigner Michael Randle, and a petty Irish criminal, Sean Bourke. </p> <p>The special branch advised MI5 that a prosecution might amount to persecution - a big fish had got away, so they were taking it out on the little fish. Even after the two men acknowledged their role in a book in 1989, the authorities were reluctant to pursue them. However, political pressure finally led to them being charged with aiding the escape, and, in 1991, they were tried at the Old Bailey, where, 30 years earlier, Blake himself had been sent to prison for 42 years, a sentence of unprecedented length. </p> <p>Throughout their trial, Pottle and Randle insisted that their action was morally justified, and, ignoring a clear direction from the judge to convict, the jury unanimously acquitted them. For Pottle, the verdict was the climax of decades of non-violent direct action, motivated by humanitarian considerations tinged with an anarchic streak. He believed that while it was responsible for cock-ups as much as conspiracies, all authority was, in the end, corrupting. </p> <p>Pottle was born in Maida Vale, London, one of the five sons (including his twin) of an Irish Catholic mother. His cockney Protestant father was a trade union official, and a socialist. He attended the village school in Garsington, near Oxford, where his father worked for Morris Motors, and, when the family moved to a council flat in Paddington, the Pottle boys went to local schools. Pat's mother wanted them to take up apprenticeships to learn specific skills; Pat went to the London College of Printing. </p> <p>During national service, he worked in the hospital at RAF Uxbridge, and organised his first anti-war demonstration in 1959. He subsequently succeeded Randle as secretary to the Committee of 100, the direct action group which broke away from CND. He participated in a number of demonstrations, including a sit-in at the Soviet embassy in London. </p> <p>In 1961, Pottle defended himself against charges under the Official Secrets Act after organising a sit-in at the US air force base at Wethersfield, Essex. Transcripts of the trial include the following exchange between the trial judge, Mr Justice Havers, and the chief prosecution witness. </p> <p>Pottle: \"Air Commodore, do you agree with this statement: 'We must not forget that by creating atomic bases in East Anglia we have made ourselves the target and perhaps the bullseye of a Soviet attack'?\" </p> <p>Havers: \"Don't answer that. I rule it out.\" Pottle: \"That was a statement of Sir Winston Churchill.\" </p> <p>Pottle and Randle, one of five other defendants, were jailed for 18 months, and it was while in Wormwood Scrubs that they met George Blake. </p> <p>Following his release from jail, Pottle became secretary to the philosopher and disarmament campaigner, Bertrand Russell. In 1964, he was tried and deported from China for \"inciting the Chinese people to overthrow the state\". Later that year, he was deported from Greece after joining anti-nuclear demonstrations. Shortly afterwards, he was deported from Malta after organising an anti-nuclear demonstration there. </p> <p> </p> <p> In 1967, he co-founded the Vietnam Information Group to help US deserters and draft dodgers reach Sweden. A year later, he was arrested in London while demonstrating against the Greek colonels' coup, but escaped from a police van after noticing that the back doors were unlocked. He also organised demonstrations against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. </p> <p>In 1969, Pottle decided to move his young family to north Wales for some peace and quiet. There, he developed his interest in antiques, and ran the Pottle Press, mainly printing leaflets for the peace movement and non-government organisations. Ten years later, they returned to London. </p> <p>It was not, however, until 1989 that Pottle and Randle decided to set straight the record of their role in the Blake affair, following a whispering campaign against them prompted by a book on the Soviet spy by Montgomery Hyde. \"We didn't want needlessly to invite prosecution, but there were stories naming others who weren't involved, accusing us of being communist agents, trying to discredit the anti-nuclear campaign,\" Pottle said at the time. </p> <p>In their own book, The Blake Escape, the pair described the ease with which they had helped the Soviet spy scale the prison wall with a rope ladder, and how he was hidden in various north London flats as a massive police hunt was mounted. In the end, Randle and his family had smuggled Blake to East Germany hidden under a bunk in their camper van. </p> <p>The narrative had its moments of black humour. One day, the wife of one of the people harbouring Blake went for a regular visit to her psychiatrist. She told him the Soviet spy was in her house. The psychiatrist replied that she was deluding herself, and had seen too much of Blake on television. She was told to take more pills. </p> <p>Pat Pottle will be remembered for his generosity, warmth and humanity, and as a brilliant raconteur. Last summer, he and his wife, Sue, bought a house in Harlech, north Wales, with the intention of dabbling in antiques and offering bed and breakfast. </p> <p>He is survived by Sue and their two sons, Casper and Julian. </p> <p> \u0095 Patrick Brian Pottle, anti-war campaigner, born August 8 1938; died October 1 2000 </p> <p>The following are extracts from Pat Pottle's address to the jury before his acquittal on June 26 1991 </p> <p>This prosecution has come about because 110 MPs signed a motion calling for our prosecution, and because of a threat of a private prosecution from the inaptly named Freedom Association . . . </p> <p>Your task would be a lot easier if this were a simple case of guilt or innocence, but it is not. It is a case of right and wrong. It is a case of politics, a case of how governments lie, cheat and manipulate, and then cover their tracks in a smokescreen of official secrecy . . . </p> <p>This is a political trial. A political decision was taken in 1970 not to prosecute. When we were publicly named in 1987, it came as no surprise to the police: they had known since 1970 . . . </p> <p>The accepted theory about George's escape was that it was organised and carried out by agents at the KGB. That was embarrassing to British intelligence, but at least they could argue that the KGB was a worldwide organisation with limitless resources. What would the revelation that a petty criminal and two peace activists had carried out the escape do to our relations with our allies? It was better that the world continued to believe that the whole thing was organised by the KGB rather than the Lavender Hill Mob. </p> <p>The judge has ruled our reasons for freeing George to be irrelevant . . . I disagree with the judge. The idea of a jury system is that you can look at the whole case, not just the legal mumbo-jumbo. You are 12 independent people. Unlike most judges you exist in the ordinary world of everyday life . . . Common sense must tell you that our reasons for helping to free George from prison must be relevant . . . </p> <p>The moral indignation about George's work for the Russians is something I completely agree with. But moral outrage is only genuine when applied to both sides. Have our values become so perverted that we only claim moral outrage at the other side's activities and not our own? </p> <p>What George did for British intelligence and the KGB was wrong - we have never tried to justify it nor whitewash it. But espionage is a dirty business, where rumour becomes fact and fact becomes fiction. The individuals involved in it are exploiters and in turn exploited. Even when caught they can still be used as international pawns in a game, some to be swapped, some to be given immunity, and the unlucky ones left to rot in prison. No one who supports this kind of thing can hold their heads up high. </p> <p>What did George do that sets him apart from other spies uncovered at that time? He was not really British, was he? Not of the old school, not one of us. Deep down, he was a foreigner, and half-Jewish to boot. He was never part of that privileged undergraduate set at Cambridge in the 1930s. Not like dear old Kim [Philby] . . . or dear old Anthony [Blunt] . . . </p> <p>A secret trial, a vicious sentence of 42 years, a secret appeal - is this democracy in action? Is this open justice? Are we not becoming the very thing we condemn? </p> <p>George was no threat to you, me, or our children. He had been caught spying for the Russians, just as they had caught people spying for the west. His usefulness was over, his spying activities at an end. What purpose was served by giving him such a sentence? . . . </p> <p>When the government and its judges allow themselves to be dictated to by mob hysteria, you end up with a society whose laws and penal institutions are based on revenge and nothing else. </p> <p>In the end it comes down to this: a fellow human being asked for help. That help meant breaking the law. I feel no shame in having done so, but I would have felt great shame had I turned down George's request for help. </p> <p>Yes, I helped George Blake escape. I did it for purely humanitarian reasons. I think we were right to do so. I would do it again. I have no apologies to make and no regrets. I will finish by quoting Bertrand Russell: 'Remember your humanity; forget the rest.'</p>",
  "Switzerland is preparing to introduce legislation that effectively would allow the consumption of cannabis, adding to the country's pioneering but controversial record on drugs policy. <p>The Swiss government said it would draw up legislation next year after consultation among local authorities and community associations revealed that there was widespread support for decriminalising cannabis.</p> <p>\"Two-thirds of the organisations consulted said they were in favour of this move,\" the interior minister, Ruth Dreifuss said yesterday.</p> <p>But the same groups opposed any such move on hard drugs, and officials ruled out softer laws on possessing or using such substances.</p> <p>Switzerland has the most liberal approach in Europe towards the treatment of heroin addicts. Since 1998 it has been providing clean needles and allowing the distribution of heroin to addicts under strict medical supervision.</p> <p>The policy, approved by Swiss voters in 1998 but criticised by international drug enforcement bodies, also involves tougher prevention measures, comprehensive social support for addicts and a police clampdown on heroin users as well as dealers.</p> <p>As many as 937 addicts were on record as following this heroin regime last December. The federal health authorities said this system had improved the social conditions and overall health of about two-thirds of those treated for two years, and brought their drug habit under control.</p> <p>Deaths from heroin overdoses have also been declining in recent years, according to official figures, but there has been a surge in the consumption of cocaine and synthetic drugs such as ecstasy.</p> <p>Swiss police and justice officials have said they fear \"drugs tourism\" if soft drugs are legalised, especially if the country is out of step with its neighbours.</p> <p>The new legislation on cannabis is likely to include a minimum age of 16 or 18 years, and reinforced penalties for dealers and anyone who \"incites consumption\".</p> <p>But cannabis would, in effect, be put on an equivalent footing to alcohol and cigarettes.</p> <p>\"We also need prevention measures because, quite frankly, we don't want young people to take up cannabis,\" Suzanne Auer, a spokeswoman for the Swiss interior ministry said.</p> <p>The Swiss cabinet has not yet decided whether production and sale of cannabis would also be tolerated, but Ms Dreifuss said that if producers respected some restrictions, their activities \"could be tolerated even though still punishable by law\".</p>",
  "One of the apartheid state's most notorious assassins has for the first time linked the former white regime's security forces to a massacre that almost wrecked negotiations to end minority rule <p>Ferdi Barnard, a member of two security-force death squads who is serving a life sentence for murder, yesterday told South Africa's truth and reconciliation commission, which is investigating apartheid crimes, that hitmen gave guns to Zulu hostel-dwellers to carry out a series of massacres. </p> <p>The killings, in townships near Johannesburg, aimed to destabilise the African National Congress during the talks in the early 1990s. </p> <p>The most notorious massacre was eight years ago, when 39 people were slaughtered in their homes in the middle of the night at Boipatong, south of Johannesburg. Barnard said that a few days before these killings he was told that guns were to be given to Zulus in the local hostel for an attack on the ANC. </p> <p>When FW de Klerk, then president, visited the massacre scene, he was chased away by thousands of angry residents. </p> <p>The ANC, which had already put negotiations on hold to protest at the government's complicity in the mounting violence, considered calling off the talks altogether. But that would play into the hands of the killers, it decided, and Boipatong eventually made the ANC more determined to make the negotiations succeed. </p> <p>Government members from the early 1990s have consistently denied that the security forces had any hand in the massacre, but Barnard's testimony will reinforce the widely held belief in South Africa that a \"third force\" played a big role in such killings. </p> <p>He is seeking amnesty for a number of crimes, including the 1989 murder of a prominent academic and human rights activist, David Webster, whom he confesses to killing, and for hanging the foetus of a baboon outside the home of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. </p> <p>Barnard worked for at least two hit squads, the infamous \"civil cooperation bureau\" and the army's \"directorate of covert collections\". </p> <p>Yesterday he also told the commission that the apartheid army had recruited criminals to disrupt ANC rallies in the run-up to the first free election in 1994. </p> <p>\"These things I personally arranged. These were paid out of state funds,\" he said. </p> <p>During a break in yesterday's testimony, the transport minister, Dullah Omar, shook hands with Barnard, who came close to murdering him in 1989. The hitman said he hid in Mr Omar's garage with a gun, but the anti-apartheid activist came home with his wife and Barnard fled. </p> <p>\"I knew I was going to be responsible for Omar's death. I had no doubt,\" he told the commission.</p>",
  "The French Communist party leader, Robert Hue, and 19 other defendants, including a former senior executive from the water, waste and entertainment giant Vivendi, appeared before a Paris court yesterday charged with running an illegal party slush fund in the early 1990s. <p>The case marks another blow to France's political establishment, shaken last month by allegations that President Jacques Chirac was involved in a kickback operation for his conservative RPR party. </p> <p>Mr Hue, whose party has 38 MPs in the national assembly and is a member of the ruling coalition, has denied all charges of influence-peddling and insists that the communists have only ever been funded by membership fees, MPs' salaries and sales of lily-of-the-valley on May Day. </p> <p>\"Some people would like to mix up the scandals now under way with the charges against us today,\" he said. \"We will show that the charges against the French Communist party are without foundation.\" </p> <p>The prosecution alleges that between 1990 and 1994, after the introduction of legislation that was supposed to end slush funds and kickbacks, a consultancy firm that advised mainly communist-run councils accepted \u00a32m from Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE) - as Vivendi was then known - in return for recommending that the company be awarded water supply and waste management contracts. </p> <p>Magistrates believe the cash then landed in the Communist party's coffers via an internal laundering system involving fake bills for advertisements in the party's daily newspaper l'Humanit\u00e9. </p> <p>\"It was common practice - every party was up to this kind of thing,\" said Claude Poperin, a former communist militant. \"Hue has to tell the truth about this.\" </p> <p>Another former party official, Claude Llabres, said he could \"bear witness that it was always a lot easier to cream a few per cent off the top of a contract over a lunch of foie gras and Sauternes with a businessman than it was to stand outside the factory gates with recruiting pamphlets\". </p> <p>CGE, renamed Vivendi two years ago, is one of France's most successful conglomerates. Best known for its recent mega-merger with the French pay-TV channel Canal Plus and the US entertainment giant Universal, it also runs 20% of Britain's rail network through Connex. </p> <p>In the dock alongside Mr Hue were Pierre Sotura, the party's treasurer, and J\u00e9rome Deschamps, CGE's former deputy managing director.</p>",
  "<p>This week the world's motor industry is strutting its stuff in Paris. For car buffs there is the usual mixture of the quirky and the workaday. Designers' dreams are parked alongside production directors' realities. Mondeo man can imagine climbing behind the wheel of the latest customised Ferrari. </p> <p>The show, Mondial de l'Automobile 2000, is not just about prices and performance, style and safety, however. Despite the launch of the new Mini, the hot news has more to do with developments in mobile phones than brakehorse power or fuel consumption. </p> <p>For one of the eight halls at the exhibition centre at Porte Versailles is entirely dedicated to the interaction of the car with the new information and communication technologies. </p> <p>According to the organiser, Cyberh@all, this is the first time a motor show has set aside an entire hall to the new information and communication technologies. </p> <p>True enough, some of the exhibition stands offer little more than sophisticated computer games or online services with automotive industry related content. </p> <p>Others, however, portray a vision - rapidly becoming a reality in some cases - of how the capability to transmit information to and from cars through the internet can be exploited as the automotive industry catches on to the fast expanding potential of the mobile telephone. </p> <p>Peugeot, Citroen and Vivendi, for example, chose the show to unwrap their Wappi! portal. Although many systems concentrate on im porting information into the car via the internet, Wappi! goes the other way. </p> <p>Drivers speeding down the motorway wondering what the funny clunking noise in their car is will be able to find out via the Wappi! portal. It will offer the option of onboard diagnosis or allow an approved to check out remotely what is happening. </p> <p>Handily, the same system can be used to immobilise stolen vehicles- which could cause a few surprises for future generations of joyriders. The Peugeot 607 will be the first car to carry the security system but the manufacturer is hoping to offer it on most other models by 2002. </p> <p>In-car services on show include on-board navigation systems with both visual display and audio systems as well as video systems installed in the back of the front seat headrests which, like some airline systems, can be used to show films. Online games and internet surfing options are on the way. But perhaps the most intriguing exhibit is Siemens' Automotive \"concept cockpit\". As the driver approaches, the vehicle's onboard system recognises a special card and automatically unlocks the doors. Activiating a small finger-print recognition panel allows both the driver's seat and the steering wheel to be switched to pre-programmed preferred positions. </p> <p>Forget instrument dials: be hind the steering wheel is a panel on which the information found on the conventional dashboard can be flashed up. </p> <p>Drivers can use the mobile phone system by tracing the numbers they want on a pad in the centre of the steering column. Another screen, positioned where most cars at present have the radio, flashes up incoming emails. The passenger glove compartment opens to reveal a computer keyboard while the dashboard houses a tiny camera which allows video conferencing. </p> <p>At this point one can be forgiven for recalling a short but pointed poem which runs something like: \"Beneath this slab John Brown is stowed. He watched the ads and not the road.\" But not to worry, apparently. According to Siemens, most of the automated services likely to be on offer are linked to the car's central braking system as well as the internet and so will not function unless the car is stationary. </p> <p>Given the propensity of some drivers for hands-free motoring - free of the steering wheel, that is - such precautions are hardly over the top.</p>"
