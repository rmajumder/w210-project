  "Down in the mosh pit, while Al Gore was midway through his coming-out speech, two of his aides slapped a high five; his young and idealistic speechwriter, Eli Attie, and seasoned, cynical 'message guru', Carter Eskew. <p>'I stand here tonight,' Gore had just told the electrified crowd, 'as my own man'. It was the moment of the passing of the torch, the handover of the leadership of the Democrat Party - and maybe the White House - by the President who had stolen the show on Monday night. His deputy and political 'son' was now delivering the most important speech of his life. </p> <p>To the delight of Gore's audience and the surprise of many, he rose to the occasion with a declaration of war in a time of peace; with impatience at a time of prosperity and content. Naomi Wolf's 'Alpha Male' had broken free. </p> <p>The speech was unabashedly populist, a class-conscious battle-cry crafted to forge an abyss between himself and his opponent, George W. Bush, who next day accused Gore of 'class warfare'. Gore cast Bush as a defender of 'powerful interests', while he would champion the 'working families of America'. </p> <p>It is a high-risk strategy, which enlivens the struggle against Bush. This now becomes - issue for issue, brick by brick - the most politically polarised election since Ronald Reagan's. </p> <p>'The presidency,' said Gore, 'is more than a popularity contest' - a dig at Bush and, in its way, at Clinton too - 'it is a day-to-day fight for people. There are big choices ahead and a shopping list of reforms in education, health-care, social security, law and order, and our whole future is at stake ... We have got to win this election.' This was not a 'new' Al Gore, but it was - as one of his close aides said - 'as good as he gets', when it mattered most. </p> <p>Gore took a big gamble last week in Los Angeles. He was forced into it not so much by his own convictions as by the most contorted and complex heredity ever bestowed on a politician - a miasma of personal and political relationships. </p> <p>Talking to The Observer after the speech, one of Gore's closest aides said: 'It's been so incredibly complicated - like a family fraught with relationships and loyalties pulling and pushing him in all directions. Clinton, Hillary, Monica, the whole White House thing.' </p> <p>Foremost among those relationships is that with the President, out of whose long shadow Gore had to emerge if he was to live up to the declaration of independence that Attie and Eskew (among others) enjoyed so much. </p> <p>Last week Clinton cast two contradictory shadows over his prot\u00e9g\u00e9: his lambent valediction on Monday night, and the news, leaked on the day of Gore's speech that Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's successor is considering re-opening the Monica Lewinsky wound. </p> <p>The President had promised not to step into Gore's spotlight, but he could hardly help being himself. Everyone agreed that Clinton's farewell address was a star performance. </p> <p>Far from setting the stage for Gore, Clinton staked his own personal claim of credit for America's good times. This is something Clinton has always felt he was due, but not granted, as his obsession with his legacy swings between three moods: contrition, whimsical melancholia and Monday's charismatic self-satisfaction. The mood swings are fast and frequent. Last week Clinton went before the cameras to clutch the hand of a tele-evangelist, describe his embarkation upon a 'new life', beg forgiveness for his 'terrible mistakes' and implore the public not to blame Al Gore. </p> <p>Meanwhile, staff in the West Wing talk about Clinton's 'dark moods', which often permeate his speeches in lines that resemble those of an emperor who has seen through his own game of power play - such as, 'in 200 years' time, all of us will have been forgotten'. </p> <p>Then came Monday: Clinton's contrived but effective gladiatorial walk down a tunnel leading to the stage, his shining smile and defiant response to what he took to be a personal affront from George Bush - the notion that he had somehow 'squandered' economic opportunities. It takes that kind of wound - coupled with a sense of occasion - to bring out the magic in Bill Clinton. </p> <p>All three moods in the Clinton bequest created different and complex challenges for Gore last week. Gore had to maintain his distance from the Lewinsky scandal, but needed also to claim some reward for his part in Clinton's roll-call of achievement. On the other hand, he had to do this in a way that enables him to appear as a leader, not a perennial number two. </p> <p>He also needed to find his own manifesto - it would not be enough to promise more of the same - especially because Bush thinks that is his line. </p> <p>There were other pressures too, not least from an even longer shadow across American politics than that of Clinton, and an even more illustrious name - Kennedy. The note sounded by that name was a loud one in Los Angeles last week: it was exactly 40 years ago in LA that John F. Kennedy was nominated by the Democratic convention, announcing the 'New Frontier' in an epic speech which defined the politics and aspirations of a generation. </p> <p>In the year 2000, the bridge between Clinton's big night and that of Gore's began with the remarkable appearance of four Kennedys during Tuesday, notably the secretive Caroline - sole survivor of JFK's immediate family. Her rare, elegant address was a high water mark of the convention, recalling her father's life and death, and saying: 'Now we are the New Frontier, and now that many of us are doing so well, it is time once again to ask more of ourselves. Much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness and decency.' </p> <p>The leader of the clan, Senator Ted, followed with a coded manifesto for everything that he - as guardian of the party's left wing - believes the Clinton administration should have done but did not, mainly in healthcare and social security. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer , the heir to Camelot - Patrick Kennedy, son of Bobby - said he found it 'surreal' to have his relatives take the stage in this way. 'This is not the real world here,' he said. Now in charge of the Democrats' fundraising, Congressman Kennedy added that 'politics is not about the kind of charisma that my father and uncle had; it is about hard work, everyday hard work'. </p> <p>But all these Kennedy conversations and addresses had one striking feature in common: Clinton was not mentioned. Four decades on, the name Kennedy represented the liberal ideals that Clinton is thought, by the party's left, to have abandoned, or at least sidelined, and which now lodged their claim - from among the party base, at least - with his successor. </p> <p>The challenge to Gore was to balance this claim - and the need to secure his own, still not conquered, party base - against the battle for the centre-ground votes and the 'undecideds', among whom he trails Bush. </p> <p>Faced with this labyrinth of complex and contradictory challenges, the stakes were higher than the expectations when Gore took the podium on Thursday to take President Clinton's baton. In the event, Gore took a gamble. </p> <p>He forged what may emerge as his own brand of unashamed populism, which combined some of Clinton's centrism with a decisive step to the left of the President he has served. </p> <p>At a time when a largely contented electorate shows little taste for political confrontation, Gore laced Clinton's 'New Democrat' vision with more than a touch of the 'Old'. He blasted big oil, big insurance, big tobacco and big everything in bellicose language that belonged more to Franklin Roosevelt's party of the Thirties than that which Clinton returned to the presidential office eight years ago. </p> <p>Gore focused not on what the Clinton administration has done, but what it left undone in the lives of those whom pundits call the 'K-Mart voter', whom Gore promised to champion and characterised as 'people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to pay for college and do right by their kids'. Out of the 5,100 words in his speech, only one of them was 'Clinton'. Twenty were 'fight'. </p> <p>At times, Gore's description of the political landscape even felt like a speech from opposition, rather than from the deputy leader who had painted it. </p> <p>Indeed, George Bush was quick to spot this on Friday, saying that the 'laundry list' of Gore's proposed reforms 'seems like a reflection on past failures'. </p> <p>In his best lines, Gore conceded that he appears 'a bit of a policy wonk' and 'won't always be the most exciting politician', but offered a stark contrast to Clinton with a pledge that: 'I will never let you down.' </p> <p>The list of commitments on children, health insurance, education, guns, abortion and crime was a strident and often ambitious one, and, echoing Caroline Kennedy, Gore promised to 'challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning'. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the speech, those around Gore were happy, but wary of the electoral task to which this rhetoric now commits them, and those on the left were pleasantly surprised. </p> <p>Harold Ickes is the Democrats' left-wing Svengali figure and a long-time foe of Gore (he privately believes Gore cost him the post of Chief of Staff). He conceded to The Observer: 'It was good. The last quarter, very good.' </p> <p>George Stephanopoulos, a key strategist in both Clinton presidential campaigns, who left Clinton's White House disappointed, told The Observer he thought 'Gore did a good job. Great speech. It's what we've been waiting to hear from him'. </p> <p>The early polls suggest that America broadly agrees, but the test will come over the next few days. One source close to Gore said that the team felt the 'springboard effect of the convention has to bring Gore within three points of Bush, otherwise we're in big trouble'. </p> <p> <b>The style file: Gore and Clinton</b><br></p> <p> <b> William Jefferson Blythe Clinton IV </b></p> <p><b>Born: </b> 19 August, 1946, three months after his father died.

  "<p>Arsene Wenger was spoilt for choice as he lined up the targets for his after-match verbal assault. Referee Steve Dunn's dismissal of Patrick Vieira, Sunderland's uncompromising approach and the woeful finishing of his players were all fuel for the fury of the Arsenal manager. </p> <p>Vieira's assault on Darren Williams and keeper David Seaman's leaden-footed part in Niall Quinn's goal somehow escaped Wenger's critical eye, although he may be less inclined to absolve them after studying video evidence. </p> <p>Wenger's comments made for a fascinating inquest into a one-sided match that Arsenal should have wrapped up by half-time and won with several goals to spare. Peter Reid's reaction was more succinct. 'Mr Wenger is a very intelligent man and is entitled to his opinion,' said the Sunderland manager. 'I just think it's a load of crap. I don't comment on his players and he shouldn't comment on mine.' </p> <p>Wenger certainly had plenty to say about Sunderland, deprived of several influential players through injuries and suspensions and forced to play four others - including Kevin Phillips - who were patently not fit. </p> <p>Reid accepted the best, option for his patched-up team was to mark Kanu and show the commitment and resilience personified by his new signing Stanislav Varga, whose \u00a3650,000 price tag shows the Sunderland manager retains an eye for a bargain. </p> <p>Wenger was not impressed by Sunderland's approach, which frustrated Arsenal and was a factor in the 90th minute red card for Vieira, who lashed out after being pulled back by Williams. </p> <p>The Sunderland substitute was booked, but that wasn't enough for Wenger. He said: 'Vieira lost his temper, but every time you tried to attack, you had people pulling shirts and 10 men behind the ball. </p> <p>'I would have sent off the Sunderland player as well for repeatedly pulling his shirt. When Williams came off I didn't see anything on his face, but he was down for two minutes, got Patrick sent off and gave his team some time.' </p> <p>Even Reid had sympathy for Vieira. 'The ref's job is very difficult, but I thought Patrick was desperately unlucky because his arm wasn't raised maliciously,' he said. </p> <p>Vieira has been sent off five times in England, prompting Wenger to say: 'I wouldn't like to think that his reputation is affecting referees. He tried to play football today, some players didn't.' Wenger's final point was valid. The vast majority of the football was undoubtedly played by Arsenal, who quickly settled into a familiar fluent vein, but - with Dennis Bergkamp on the bench - failed to accept any of 10 clear-cut opportunities. </p> <p>Ray Parlour, Thierry Henry, Fredrik Ljungberg, Kanu ... the list of culprits in the first-half was a long one, although the goalkeeping of Thomas Sorensen was a factor in their failings. </p> <p>Arsenal paid the price for their errant shooting seven minutes into the second half and, on the day Phillips received the Golden Boot for finishing as the Premiership's top scorer last season, it was the Golden Bonce of Niall Quinn that despatched his former club. </p> <p>Quinn headed in Michael Gray's 52nd minute cross after an ill-timed challenge by Seaman which will add substance to the doubts surrounding the keeper. The goal heralded even more frantic attacks by Arsenal, by now faced by keeper Jurgen Macho, a half-time substitute for Sorensen. The Austrian under-21 international took his cue from the Dane, saved superbly from Robert Pires and Henry and saw Kanu place the best opportunity wide in the 72nd minute. </p> <p>'We showed a terrific will to win,' said Reid. 'It was pure character and I'm delighted with my players. We played against a very good side and hung in there.' </p> <p>Wenger was equally encouraged by his team's performance. 'I feel sorry for my players,' he said. 'We will win the championship if we dominate games like that for the rest of the season. </p> <p>'The big regret is that we didn't take our chances. We had seven or eight one-on-ones and still lost. I have not lost a game like that in England before.'</p>",
  "<p>Martin O'Neill, sensible man that he is, refused to make promises when he became manager of Celtic, but he did venture a prediction; namely that, given a break from injury, Chris Sutton would be 'a huge contributor' to the team. The striker made O'Neill look like a seer, with the goals which set Celtic in motion towards an emphatic victory in a fixture that has traditionally proved very troublesome. </p> <p>The kind of productive burst produced by Sutton during that extraordinary first half is the short route to canonisation by a Celtic support eager to receive anyone who can respond to their supplications with small miracles. What was significant about the big Englishman's contribution was that he was able to give the Parkhead side a two-goal lead during a period in which the recognised redeemer, Henrik Larsson, had been unable to make an impact. It is extremely rare for Celtic to be able to boast a distinct advantage without the Swede's name on the credits. </p> <p>Even when Larsson scored the third close to the interval, his lack of characteristic sharpness and finesse remained noticeable. The forward's energy and commitment remain beyond question, but he has yet to recover the quick control that marked his endeavours prior to the leg fracture he sustained last October. </p> <p>Yet the prospect of Larsson returning to his most formidable may be bad news for opponents, as Sutton has already appeared to be a sound piece of business by O'Neill, even at \u00a36 million from Chelsea. </p> <p>He looked dangerous from the start, bothering the Hearts defence with powerful running and a lightness of touch with foot and head which created openings for team-mates. Yet his first goal was the result of a miscalculation by Gary Naysmith, the Hearts full-back. </p> <p>Antti Niemi, the home goalkeeper, seemed to have the ball virtually in his hands on his six-yard line when the defender came in to knock it out, but only managed to get it as far as Bobby Petta on the Celtic left. The Dutchman whipped the centre straight to Sutton and the striker headed it to the left of Niemi from eight yards. </p> <p>Hearts had busied themselves around the Celtic goal before this, although they tended to find Jonathan Gould in good form. He had to dive low to his right to prevent Scott Severin's low drive, from a short free-kick, from giving the home side an equaliser in the short time between Sutton's first and second goals. </p> <p>The one which doubled the advantage could not have been more orthodox, Sutton cleanly heading a corner kick from Petta on the right into Niemi's right corner from six yards. </p> <p>Hearts' resurgence was prompted by the appearance of Juanjo and Kris O'Neill in place of Lee Makel and Darren Jackson, the substitutes bringing a youthful liveliness to an attack in particular and a team in general who had seemed discouraged. The new self-belief was strengthened when Severin scored with another fierce low drive from a short free-kick by Colin Cameron. </p> <p>Even when Moravcik restored Celtic's three-goal advantage with a high drive from Sutton's pass, the home side retained enough spirit to continue to give their visitors bother. </p> <p>This was brilliantly illustrated by their second goal. Naysmith released O'Neill down the left, a quick shimmy took the youngster clear of McNamara and his precise centre was bulleted past Gould on the volley from Juanjo, coming in from the right.</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Keegan tipped Manchester City as his outside tip for a successful season on their return to the top flight after four years in the wilderness. Ever the optimist, no doubt the England manager will say that City have time to recover, but he has been wrong before. </p> <p>City were as woeful as Charlton were wonderful as last season's First Division Champions suggested that they might have what it takes to stay up this time. Then again, maybe they were just made to look good. </p> <p>City manager Joe Royle was spot-on when he said: 'There was no cohesion in our play and we were very poor in the first half. Paulo Wanchope had only trained for one day with us and they did look like strangers out there. But we lost the first game last season and won promotion so it is too soon to panic.' </p> <p>Goalkeeper Nicky Weaver may have had a feeling he was in for a busy Premiership debut trying to protect the City net when Claus Jensen cracked a free-kick towards the top right-hand corner of his goal in the first minute. </p> <p>Weaver superbly clawed the ball away and went on to have a great game, but he was left far too exposed by his team-mates to stand a chance of keeping City in the game. </p> <p>It was no surprise when Andy Hunt gave Charlton a 10th-minute lead. Collecting a Jensen through-pass, Hunt worked the ball on to his right foot and drilled a fairly unstoppable shot inside the near post. </p> <p>The City midfield was continually outplayed and overrun and Charlton's inevitable second came through John Robinson three minutes before half-time. </p> <p>Lisbie cut through the City defence with a powerful 20-yard run and scuffed a shot as Weaver came out to block. The ball broke to Robinson who took two touches before scoring with the help of a deflection off Steve Howey. </p> <p>'Considering we had five strikers out injured I'm delighted with the start,' said Charlton manager Alan Cur bishley. 'I'm delighted with the performance for the opening game of the season and we really took advantage when City threw caution to the wind in the second half.' </p> <p>City's new strike partnership of George Weah and Wanchope had barely seen the ball by the time the teams emerged for the second half and Charlton soon gained even more control of the match with new signing Jensen running the show. The home fans even had the foresight to get in an early cry of 'We are top of the League' as the next two goals flew in. </p> <p>Mark Kinsella scored Charlton's third in the 72nd minute after good approach work and an unselfish pass from Graham Stuart gave him the chance to finish from just inside the penalty area. </p> <p>Kinsella repaid the offering when he burst into the penalty area six minutes later and was blatantly tripped by Weaver. The City keeper escaped with a booking, but was further punished when Stuart sent him the wrong way from the penalty spot for Charlton's fourth.</p>",
  "<p>As sleeping giants go, Preston North End are certainly in the big five, especially with huge mosaics of Sir Tom Finney and Bill Shankly on Deepdale's two new stands acting as permanent reminders of the past. </p> <p>It is 19 years since the ground has tasted league football at this level, 30 years since they dropped out of the top division, so joint top of the table on maximum points after two games is more than anyone could surely have expected, especially as the performance here against a very experienced and by no means unskilful United side matched the emphatic scoreline. </p> <p>But no one is getting carried away. The club have a long way to go before contemplating the Premiership - starting with another new stand planned for the New Year - and the playing squad are virtually the same as gained promotion from Division Two. </p> <p>Survival has always been the target this year, and so far the signs are good. As pleasing as the goals were - and two inside six minutes was surely beyond the stuff of dreams - manager David Moyes was most satisfied with the way the team defended. </p> <p>'Three goals without reply in our first game in Division One for 19 years, I'll take that every time,' he said. 'But after the two goals early on, we had to defend well because they threw everything at us in that first half. We're still learning at this level. We don't really know what to expect. If we're still in this position in twenty games, then I'll be really happy.' </p> <p>Jonathan Macken, the former Manchester United trainee who notched 25 goals last year, scored twice to add to his opening day goal, and was denied a hat-trick only when a late effort came back off the crossbar. The 22-year-old looks assured, strong and quick, and with finishing like this, is rightly attracting scouts from the big clubs. </p> <p>Deepdale was in raptures after just 64 seconds, when Michael Appleton exchanged a neat one-two with Steve Basham on the edge of the box before shooting low to Simon Tracey's right. </p> <p>Worse was to follow for United, when Macken shrugged off the attentions of Gus Uhlenbeek eight yards out, swivelled and despatched an unstoppable shot to Tracey's left. </p> <p>Having been two down before even drawing breath, the visitors understandably took a while to get into their stride, but could quite easily have gone in at the break level. </p> <p>Wayne Quinn brilliantly headed Paul Devlin's dipping cross just over, before his curling 20-yard free-kick struck the post, and David Kelly narrowly failed to get to the rebound. Kelly saw another great header saved before Marcus Bent's audacious lob from the edge of the box went inches over. </p> <p>Had United converted even one of those chances, it might have been very different, but Preston went from strength to strength in the second half. </p> <p>United skipper Shaun Murphy had already denied Macken with two superb last-ditch tackles. But when the striker was first to a poor clearance and lobbed the ball over Tracey, Murphy could only deflect the ball into the roof of the net. </p> <p>United lost their discipline late on when Devlin was sent off after kicking out at Paul McKenna, and manager Neil Warnock was ordered out of the dug-out for protesting. Warnock later declined to attend the post-match press conference.</p>",
  "<p>Everything went embarrassingly wrong for Bristol's new manager, Danny Wilson, in the closing minutes of the game that had offered so much for him. </p> <p>Wilson, who had survived the bruising experiences at Sheffield Wednesday after the acclaim at Barnsley, has wasted no time putting players on offer and shaking up the West Country club. But this was nullified as the defence donated the game to Stoke, themselves a strong, tough, direct team who ironically beat their opponents at Wembley in the last Auto Windscreen final. The home side had the bonus of Thomas's mistake to give them the lead that had proved so elusive against tight marking opponents. Then they lost organisation and composure in defence - and Stoke capitalised with a lethal opportunism. </p> <p>The visitors equalised a quarter of an hour from time when substitute Graham Fenton crossed from the left for Bjarni Gudjonsson to score from a relatively unmarked position. If that was abysmal marking by Bristol, they compounded their indecision in the 87th minute and this time it was James O'Connor who snatched the winner with relative ease. In injury time Scott Murray cracked his shot against the post for Bristol; it was an optimistic gesture on a day when the defence, so compact for most of the time, suddenly and inexplicably lost its way. Wilson will be rethinking his defensive formation. </p> <p>As early as the third minute Lee Peacock, Bristol's \u00a3650,000 signing from Manchester City was making the kind of impact that impressed the Ashton Gate crowd. </p> <p>He leapt to head just wide from Brian Tinnion's corner. And he was searching and at times finding an encouraging combination with fellow striker Tony Thorpe, appointed captain by the new manager. </p> <p>He almost scored as he surged forward and just failed to control the final short pass in a five-man move on the edge of the Stoke box. </p> <p>But Stoke's solid three central defenders covered tightly, while Bristol's alert midfielders were apt to be curbed by close marking in a competitive, often attractive match, which indicated that both these teams could be promotion candidates. </p> <p>Alan Miller, an emergency loan signing from Blackburn Rovers - Bristol's two goalkeepers are both injured - looked commanding, not least when he tipped Stefan Thordarson's dipping free-kick over the bar. </p> <p>The tempo increased and at times the good nature deteriorated after the interval. Wayne Thomas earned ironic cheers after going down in a clash with Thorpe. Then the combative James O'Connor was booked after one too many skirmishes with Darren Dunning, another loan signing from Blackburn, and a teenager with a look of real maturity. </p> <p>After 64 minutes the home team were rewarded. Mickey Bell crossed from the left and Thomas, headed into his own net.</p>",
  "<p>It looks like \u00a325 million well spent. What more rewarding portents for greater things ahead than Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink off the mark, a goal to make you swoon from Mario Stanic and - Ken's your uncle - even a bogey team laid to rest. </p> <p>Never mind the Bradfords, dropping points against awkward customers like West Ham has been equally detrimental to Chelsea's championship credentials in the past. After 45 years in the title wilderness, Gianluca Vialli's new improved selection could be nine months away from a summit last reached when players were slaves to the maximum wage and travelled to matches on public transport. </p> <p>A cutting edge in front of goal had been Chelsea's achilles heel last season and the manager believes his expensive acquisitions will make a difference. In Hasselbaink, whose debut was solid if not spectacular, they possess a player who is instinctive and decisive when he sees the whites of the goal posts. The purposeful Stanic, who adds impressive balance as well as flashes of spectacular technique, looks a snip. </p> <p>'Hopefully we can be better attacking-wise because we have more options,' said Vialli. 'Jimmy has pace, can shoot from long range and is a predator, and Mario gives us an aerial threat.' Add Gianfranco Zola's wizardry and the eternally patient and effective Tore Andre Flo and you can see why Vialli feels the need to talk down his team's chances in a vague attempt to deflect an unbearable level of expectation. </p> <p>Optimism pulsed through the air. But Harry Redknapp's team were in no mood to allow their London rivals to stride out in style. They pressed and created, and Davor Suker soon carved the first opening. Ed De Goey clawed back his shot and Christian Panucci, partnering Marcel Desailly in the centre of defence, helped the ball to safety. The Italian was chosen ahead of the ostracised Frank Leboeuf and Vialli was content with his contribution too. </p> <p>West Ham have ambitions of their own, too, and a three-pronged attack comprising Suker, Paolo Di Canio and Frederic Kanoute brimmed with opportunity. 'Chelsea are an outstanding team but I think we matched them today,' reckoned Redknapp. </p> <p>It took Chelsea a while to find their rhythm and range. Cometh the half-hour, cometh the man. Hasselbaink surged forward to meet Di Matteo's pass. He bore down on goal and Hislop greeted him with a thudding challenge. It looked suspiciously outside the area but referee Graham Barber ordered the penalty. Hasselbaink duly marched to the spot. It was cool, it was crisp, it bore the mark of an instant hero. </p> <p>It's hard to imagine anyone in blue spared a thought for Chris Sutton. Hasselbaink, with all his swaggering confidence, comes from a different school entirely. </p> <p>Fortunately for West Ham, they too possess a forward with similar character. Two minutes after the interval, Di Canio shocked Stamford Bridge with a stylish finish from Kanoute's shrewd approach work, although Chelsea had only themselves to blame for slack defending. </p> <p>It needed renewed resolve for Chelsea to wrestle back control of the game, and the presence of Gus Poyet, drifting dangerously towards the edge of the box, achieved precisely that. He was bodychecked by Igor Stimac. Gianfranco Zola sized up the free-kick and promptly delivered a delightful goal. </p> <p>If that was to be relished, Chelsea's third was to be truly cherished. With breathtaking panache, Stanic juggled to tee himself up before unleashing a dipping volley from 25 yards. </p> <p>The sight of Kanoute pulling one back from close range couldn't break the euphoric spell, and the irrepressible Croat reinforced the sense of wonder with a second in the last minute. The challenge now, is whether the magic can be sustained for 37 more games.</p>",
  "<p>Two words were not being spoken much at the Democrat's convention in Los Angeles: 'Monica' and 'Willard'. Monica needs neither introduction nor explanation, but Willard maybe does; it's the name Bill Clinton gave to his penis, according to another of his women, Gennifer Flowers. Clinton's reasoning: 'It's longer than Willie.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Malibu, a few miles up the Californian coast, Willard has been on the mind of one of Hollywood's most intriguing stars. Indeed, Willard is the protagonist in Joe Eszterhas's latest book, American Rhapsody , America's current number four bestseller. </p> <p>Eszterhas is the only movie screenwriter to attain and equal the superstardom of Tinseltown's actors and directors. He has had many famous and infamous ideas during his career walking in and out of Hollywood's portals, looking inside out and outside in. The best known is the 'pussy shot' of Sharon Stone crossing her legs while wearing no knickers in Basic Instinct . </p> <p>But even this was unambitious compared to American Rhapsody , which had political and movie-making circles holding their breath during the months before it was published. It's a hilarious and scandalous book, part-fact, part-fantasy, about a serious subject: Washington observed through the prism of Hollywood and vice versa. </p> <p>The Sharon Stone episode is there in full, along with a string of other fantasies that portray the actress as a dope-smoking, power-obsessed manipulator. Almost the entire Hollywood establishment is treated in the same way: Richard Gere, Michael Douglas, Warren Beatty, Gina Gershon, Glenn Close; many more are named and shamed as vain and self-obsessed. </p> <p>Writs were expected to fly as soon as the book was published and although no one has sued, Stone's agent, for one, has not ruled out action. At Knopf, the book's American publisher, the lawyers were sufficiently concerned to write a 30-page memo. In Britain two publishers have turned it down after taking legal advice. </p> <p>At the heart of American Rhapsody is an outrageous but astute portrait of Bill Clinton as America's 'first rock'n'roll President'; the man who ran the White House as a Hollywood mogul. </p> <p>'Politics has become entertainment,' says Eszterhas, 'and entertainment has become politics. Betty Thomas, who made Private Parts and Dr Dolittle, said that comedy in Hollywood was now \"funny moments with liberal inserts\", and that is right, because Sixties liberals and political correctness have taken over the industry. And the inner dynamics of Hollywood are like politics. Say you give a script to a group of executives - they all sit around, afraid to voice an opinion, saying nothing, waiting to know what the consensus is. Just like focus groups, opinion polls or a cabinet. Meanwhile, politics is about getting a candidate in front of the public as a star, politics as rock'n'roll, politics as a movie.' </p> <p>These mutually reflective prisms are a product of the cult of rock'n'roll, as epitomised by Eszterhas's own progression from Rolling Stone to Hollywood and now the innards of the Clinton scandal. 'I always wanted to be a rock'n'roll star,' admits Hollywood's highest-paid scriptwriter, 'and so did we all. So did Bill Clinton. Fact is we went on to do other things. But we still wanted to do our success like rock'n'roll stars.' </p> <p>That's why Bill should come to Hollywood, as he is urged to do in the pivotal chapter of American Rhapsody , 'Bubba in Pig Heaven'. 'You've got to move out here, Bubba - Hollywood is the place for you - this place reeks sex from its cellular pores. A townful of sluts on the make, Willard-friendly and experimental, bored with ham-and-egg, Al Gore orgasms.' </p> <p>Eszterhas's point is best illustrated by the knotty problem that dominated a year of American politics: the status of oral sex. Blow jobs were central to the Lewinsky scandal. Bill Clinton insisted that blow jobs do not count as sex; much of America agreed. Eszterhas assures the President that oral sex is what manicure girls offer in Hollywood as a matter of routine; they are 'a little break in a busy afternoon', just as they were for Bill in the Oval Office. Same for rock stars in between make-up and the stage. And that's the whole point: 'This is the permeation of rock'n'roll into everything,' says Eszterhas. </p> <p>He was born in Hungary in 1944, the year the country's Jews were rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 'I've studied the Holocaust extensively,' he says. 'It's my lifelong obsession.' His family fled when the Red Army cut a swathe across the country, as far as Austria, where the boy and his parents were moved from camp to camp by British and American military authorities. </p> <p>After the war, they moved to the rust-belt town of Cleveland, Ohio, where his father edited a Catholic-Hungarian newspaper. Young Joe knew little English, but learned quickly enough to graduate and get a job on the Cleveland Plain Dealer , for which he interviewed Jimi Hendrix. He was obliged to leave the paper, however, after causing it to lose a libel suit to the tune of $16,000, a colossal sum in 1971. At that time, there was only one magazine that would give a home to a man who had developed a lifestyle propelled by a mix of drugs, booze and his Willard (by his own admission). He joined Jan Wenner's Rolling Stone and from there made the move to Hollywood. </p> <p>'I remembered what Hemingway said,' recalls Eszterhas. 'He said, \"Stop at the California state line, don't do it; it'll break your heart\". I decided not to stop and not to let it break my heart.' </p> <p>His first script, which got him into an immediate fight with Sylvester Stallone, was 'Fist' . 'It was 300 pages long. A page a minute - that's a long movie, and that's how little I knew.' At the time, Eszterhas said: 'I have always been fascinated by the corruption of power.' </p> <p>Eszterhas lives in a house on the ocean-front of the Malibu Riviera. Bob Dylan is a neighbour. The greeting is warm and relaxed; his kids charge around covered in sand and seawater. The sofas are decorated with Native American designs and the walls are a shrine to the Sixties: a picture of the Beatles signed by George Harrison; Muhammad Ali; Robert Kennedy. His own scripts - Jagged Edge , Music Box , Telling Lies in Hollywood , Sliver , Basic Instinct - share shelf space with the complete works of Charles Dickens. </p> <p>Eszterhas's wife, Naomi, moves as graciously around this m\u00e9nage as is possible for someone who has given birth to a fourth son, Luke, just two days before. They are blissfully happy, 'but it took me 50 years to get there,' says Eszterhas. Their meeting is a story in itself: Sharon Stone ran off with Eszterhas's friend, Bill McDonald, who duly deserted his wife, Naomi. As an act of friendship, Eszterhas and his wife, Geri, decided to take Naomi on a break, only for the screenwriter and the jilted wife to fall in love. 'If someone asked me if I introduced Bill and Sharon deliberately to get hold of Naomi, I'd say, subliminally, I'm sure they're right.' </p> <p>When most American writers call themselves 'outsiders', one is sceptical. With Eszterhas, you know it's more than partly true. 'I was six when we came to this country. When I was 14 or so, I still had a lot of trouble with it. I saw my father humiliated countless times in limitless ways. Every time I saw that happen, I was thrown into full-blown hysterics, like a two-year-old. I find myself with an immediate understanding of people who are on the outside, the Jews, whatever colour or creed they are. The showgirls, gays and outcasts.' </p> <p>In Hollywood, Eszterhas has done many out-of-the-ordinary things, but one above all. He has made the usually hidden figure of the screenwriter into someone not only visible but also bankable. 'I have only one loyalty - to my writing. I never wanted to be the head of a studio or a producer,' he says. 'I just wanted to make sure that what I write is what appears on screen, to not have some idiot change it on its way to the screen. There sure as hell are some idiots in Hollywood. Complete morons.' </p> <p>This attitude has led Eszterhas into some famous scraps, victories and defeats. It led to his fight with one of the most powerful titans in Hollywood, Mike Ovitz, when Eszterhas left Ovitz's Creative Artists empire to rejoin the agent with whom he originally worked in Hollywood, 'and who gave me my break' - out of loyalty. 'I'm the only sucker in Hollywood to be accused by Ovitz of disloyalty for doing something loyal,' he shrugs. </p> <p>His greatest triumph, he says, was protecting the coda scenes of both Jagged Edge and Flashdance from 'going to the wall in the hands of the directors'. His biggest failure, he says, was the loss of control of a script dear to him, 'written with my friend, Richard Marquand, who later died. It was about an escaped convict and the relationship he had with children. The script was taken and destroyed many years later by Jean-Claude Van Damme as Nowhere to Run . It lost its sensitivity, it lost everything. I don't like to remember that movie.' </p> <p>His favourite among his own movies is Music Box , in which Jessica Lange plays an attorney defending her Hungarian father against accusations that he was a collaborator with the Nazis and a war criminal. It was the most serious film to establish the hallmark Eszterhas theme - that everyone has a past, and that it is not always the past you want people to know about. </p> <p>It was a theme he returned to in Showgirls , which he admits is the least favourite of his own films. In the film, a girl escapes a life of prostitution to join a dance troupe in Vegas. The film contained an infamous rape scene, 'which we should not, I feel now, have shown, although I do insist that to show such a scene does not imply any complicity in it. I worry that we are approaching a time when that which is shocking is squeezed out by the Stalinism of political correctness. I think the messenger was slain for the message. It's against the tyranny of political correctness that American Rhapsody is an assault.' </p> <p>The book took shape after the failure of Showgirls and the sudden convergence of other movies. 'Every time I flicked channels, there I was, talking. I was talking too much and writing too little. So Naomi and I went to Hawaii. The phone was cut off and we lost touch. This gave me the chance to have a good think about my life.' </p> <p>On his return to Los Angeles, the Lewinsky scandal was in full bloom, and Eszterhas became addicted and immersed. 'I had in mind to do a piece for Rolling Stone , but I had no idea that it would become an obsession and a 1,000-page manuscript. Maybe as a writer I was getting hemmed in by scripts. I felt like someone let out of jail and going berserk.' </p> <p>Apart from Bill, Monica and the political cast, the book singles out Sharon Stone for treatment. Eszterhas claims to have 'created' Stone and to have been her lover. He feels a 'proprietary interest' when he hears about the friendship between Clinton and Stone. She was 'Bill Clinton's ideal woman' and 'every bit as political as he', given that 'a star's career is a lifelong political campaign'. She had 'ascended her star on the strength of her privates, but had handled the challenge well'. </p> <p>'I just had this idea that Bill and Sharon wanted to get together and should have got together,' explains Eszterhas. 'But Bill would not have got away with what Hillary has let him get away with. Not only would he have had scratches on his nose, but Sharon can be quite lethal with an ice-pick.' </p> <p>Does he have it in for Sharon Stone? Eszterhas puts on his sincere face. 'Of course not. Who would? She is cuddly and warm.' Cuddly and warm? 'She's a great actress and, like Marilyn Monroe, she's the sex symbol of her time. I'm just saying this: Kennedy-Monroe, Clinton-Stone - it would have been perfect.' </p> <p>Then there's Warren Beatty, whose political ambitions are derided not only because he is 'the man with the golden Willard'. He quotes Joan Collins: 'Three, four, five times a day was not unusual for Warren. And he was able to accept phone calls at the same time.' </p> <p>The most wonderfully insulting reference to Beatty concerns not his sexual prowess but his own presidential ambitions - and his lacking the concentration required to last four years in the White House. In conversation, Eszterhas adds: 'Warren's problem is common for method actors. It's a natural reaction - method actors getting too caught up in their parts. He had done Bulworth and he couldn't let go. He had to pretend that he could do it in real life. You see? Politics as Hollywood and vice versa.' </p> <p>The book also fantasises about Farrah Fawcett Majors defecating on a lawn at a public function and Richard Gere unzipping his flies and revealing 'no boxers' while pitching a movie idea to Eszterhas. </p> <p>Eszterhas said some weeks ago that he still intended to eat at Spago's and 'get good tables'. 'Since then,' he assured me last Wednesday, 'I have eaten there, got an excellent table and many people came up to me to say how much they enjoyed my book, not least because they were not in it.' </p> <p>'He's made a few enemies with this,' one insider told The Observer . But when Tina Brown threw a party for him, 'about 300 of the supposedly offended Hollywood people turned up. Mike Medevos, head of Phoenix, said he loved it and he was happy he wasn't in it. There are plenty more like him.' </p> <p>The White House has nothing to say, even though American Rhapsody is as sympathetic a portrait as Bill Clinton is likely to get in any book that is not by a party-political ally. In understanding the Willard-propulsion of Clinton the man, Eszterhas has explained the drama that befell Clinton the President. And by seeing that drama through Hollywood's eyes , he has spoken for that stubborn 65 per cent of Americans who were unmoved by the whole affair. </p> <p>But there is one thing Eszterhas cannot forgive: the lying. Richard Nixon casts the shadow of evil in this book. 'The important thing,' says Eszterhas, 'was that Nixon was a liar and the Sixties was about telling the truth. Now we had Clinton, jabbing his middle finger at us with a great big fucking lie.'</p>",

His latest, <strong> Sick Puppy</strong>, is in his grand tradition: extreme eccentrics, corrupt politicians and an environmental issue mixed together to produce a powerful, page-turning, laugh-out-loud read. </p> <p>Pathologically short-tempered eco-terrorist Twilly Spree is dedicated to direct action to save Florida's wilderness from the depredations of profit-oriented businesses and individuals. He also hates people who drop litter. When he sees Palmer Stoat throwing fast-food cartons out of his car on the interstate, he decides to teach him a lesson. When he discovers Stoat is a political fixer brokering deals to turn a pristine Gulf Coast island into a complex of hotels, houses and shopping malls, he decides to take things a little further. </p> <p>What follows involves dognapping, bogus big-game hunting and a cast of eccentric characters that includes wealthy and semi-psychotic Spree, a prostitute who will only sleep with Republicans and Clinton 'Skink' Tyree, the state governor turned eco-warrior who lives off roadkill and is now a regular Hiaasen character. </p> <p>There is something comfortingly familiar about each new Hiaasen novel in that we know pretty much what we are going to get, given that he is on a highly entertaining but nevertheless deadly serious crusade against the environmental pillagers of his native Florida. But he remains unequalled in taking humorous ideas further than you think they can possibly go. His characterisation, the inventiveness of his comic incidents and the sheer zest of his writing makes Sick Puppy a refreshing, exhilarating read. </p> <p>Hiaasen is one of America's finest satirists. Christopher Brookmyre is Britain's. There's genuine anger in both of them. Sometimes a Brookmyre rant (his word) against some particularly monstrous piece of political/ social/ religious idiocy bursts out of the crime novel that nominally contains it, but the rants are usually so scabrously funny that he gets away with it. </p> <p>As he does in <strong> Boiling a Frog</strong>, his fifth satirical crime novel and his third to feature Jack Parlabane, the lippy investigative journalist who gets his comeuppance with a stay in prison for breaking into the Catholic Church of Scotland's offices. It's the Catholic church that Brookmyre has in his sights - plus spin doctoring, the tabloid press, the Scottish Parliament and anything else he feels needs a good kicking. </p> <p>The structure of the book is slightly unwieldy - Parlabane starts out in prison and indeed is a sort of bystander through most of it as we read an oblique account of how he ended up there. But it doesn't matter, as we're carried along by Brookmyre's humour and ability to present a lot of serious information. </p> <p>In Parlabane's first two outings, the hilarious rancour was directed at the Conservative government. Doubts about whether he could survive a New Labour victory can now be laid to rest. </p> <p>There's nothing subtle about Brookmyre's humour, as the title might indicate, and those who recall the calling-card he left on the mantelpiece in his debut novel, Quite Ugly One Morning (in the form of an unfeasibly large 'jobbie') will be heartened to know the plot proper kicks off with something equally gross here. </p> <p>You won't get any of the appalled laughter Hiaasen and Brookmyre's work engenders from Stephen Hunter's brilliant new novel, <strong> Hot Springs</strong>. All of Hunter's work is along the solemn, but certainly not dull, lines of 'a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do'. That's Man with the initial capital, of course, so only the Homeric laughter Sam Peckinpah used in movies such as The Wild Bunch would pass muster. </p> <p>Mentioning Peckinpah is apposite since Hunter, film critic for the Washington Post, writes novels that are highly cinematic and Hot Springs is redolent of several movies, including Last Man Standing, directed by Walter Hill, Peckinpah's cinematic heir. </p> <p> Hot Springs is set in 1946. Earl Swagger, its central character, is an ex-marine, Congressional Medal of Honor winner and serious drinker plagued by survivor's guilt and blood-soaked memories of the Pacific War. </p> <p>He feels himself beyond redemption until he is chosen to lead a team of rookie cops (cue The Untouchables) charged with bringing law and order back to the mob-controlled town of Hot Springs, Arkansas, the Las Vegas of its time. The result is an epic war between good guys and mobsters, where justice - and redemption - is achieved at the point of a Thompson sub-machine-gun. </p> <p>What you might call 'adventure thrillers' are usually two-dimensional, with cardboard characters and formulaic storytelling. But there are a number of modern practitioners - they include Colin Harrison and Pinckney Benedict - who operate at a much higher level. Hunter has demonstrated in the past, especially with Dirty White Boys, that he is the best of them. </p> <p>Judging by its sales, I was in a minority when I felt that Boris Starling's debut novel, Messiah, was a meretricious pick'n'mix of elements common to serial-killer novels. Now his second novel, <strong> Storm</strong>, has won the WH Smith Thumping Good Read Award and I'm still out of synch. </p> <p>It's a good enough page-turner but the story, in which DCI Kate Beauchamp survives a catastrophic ferry accident, then gets involved in the pursuit of a murderer who leaves a poisonous snake on his victims as a calling card, once more seems like something out of the ABC of Serial Killers.</p>",
  "<p>By a twist of good fortune I have been selected from a field of two to take our bookish nine-year-old to the Natural History Museum to see an exhibition about the rhythms of time with a view to tackling his habit of appearing fully dressed at our bedroom door at the crack of 7.30 in the middle of the holidays demanding to be taken to school.</p> <p> Luckily, West Anglian So-Called Railways have forgotten to cancel the 10.17 this morning so we are soon steaming towards Liverpool Street surrounded by financial services professionals whose resolutions to make 2000 the year they make some headway with world literature have been snatched from the jaws of ridicule by the chance advent of Harry Potter, who is proving to be quite the new Stephen Hawking.</p> <p> I myself have nothing to read, having left all my money in next month's salary, and the boy himself (ours, not JK Rowling's) is racing through his third Goosebumps of the week and is therefore in no humour to entertain my attempts to engage him in fatherly chit-chat, notably about his job prospects. I am convinced that he is some kind of genius and that all he needs is a judicious nudge away from tweedy subjects and on to the path of a forward-thinking career that might save us from penury in our old age as a result of unwisely having had so many children and taken out a giant mortgage to house them in bucolic comfort. 'Have you ever thought about cooking?' I ask. 'Or learning about wallpaper and sofas?' </p> <p>We arrive in plenty of time. The exhibition is fascinating, beginning with a throbbing film featuring a jungly soundtrack and employing the full range of images denoting the great circle of life - pulsing hearts, leaves falling off trees, what a cabbage looks like growing at top speed - followed by a gallery of educative material telling you how dolphins manage to swim and sleep at the same time. Why don't they crash into the central reservation and somersault into the southbound carriageway like humans do when they doze off for two seconds? Because they have dual-control brains, which is the neurobiological equivalent of asking your wife to drive. </p> <p>How come the arctic tern can migrate 35,000km a year with no ill effects while we get jet lag merely by popping over to New York for a weekend's shopping? (When I say 'we', I mean of course other people.) Mmm, don't know. And, come to think of it, why is it called an arctic tern if it hates winter so much? Still, a thoroughly enjoyable half-hour. And I don't think I'm giving too much away by revealing that antelopes are light sleepers, owing to not wanting to be eaten in their beds by lions. </p> <p>We go for lunch at the caf\u00e9 where we are able to observe a feeding frenzy at first hand, and to note how ritual in some higher mammalian communities has successfully updated nature's inviolable precepts of sudden death and precarious survival with a system of orderly queuing. After that there's just time for a quick look round the Earth galleries, which for some reason is the cue for my little brainy one to give me his A to Z of classical deities in reverse. 'I start with Zeus,' he says and work my way back to um...' </p> <p>'Arietty?' I suggest. </p> <p>'I think she was in The Borrowers , Dad,' he says gently. </p> <p>But soon we are engrossed in earthquakes and other seismic matters, which is all very interesting but there does come a point where I am obliged to stop him reading out every single caption on every specimen of volcanic rock by telling him about how his Mum and I once visited Pompeii and saw all the people who had been turned to stone in the very act of making spaghetti or playing an accordion. </p> <p>It's impossible to take everything in, of course. How astonishing that humanity has amassed so wide, profound and intricate a knowledge of the universe and yet so many of us couldn't say for certain where wind comes from. </p> <p>We head for the station. </p> <p>'Dad, did you know you can reset a crab's body clock by pouring water over it?' says my little fellow. </p> <p>'Really?' I say. </p> <p>Now there's an idea. </p> <p> phil.hogan@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "<p>I went to a wedding recently. The most remarkable thing about it was the high level of emotion between the couple. It seemed almost anachronistic to see two people getting married simply because they adored each other. The bride didn't frisk the groom at the altar for his CV. The groom didn't insist on a chat with the bride's bank manager before signing the register. Nobody stood up at the reception to make tearful speeches about how nice it was to see two such financially compatible people embark on life's journey together. Sipping our champagne, the better informed among us could only wonder at the couple's astounding socioeconomic naivety. They kept speaking of something called... 'love'. </p> <p>I jest, of course, but, should I ever decide to use a dating agency, I'd better get my act together, and not go on about being 'fun' and 'romantic', or anything socially undesirable like that. One in five people are turning to dating agencies to help them find a partner, and that figure is destined to double over the next five years. Women are leading the way, but men should be aware that they're no longer going to be content with a GSOH, and a cellophaned red rose from a street vendor. The biggest growth area is in the kind of dating agency which caters solely for 'successful professionals'. They mean 'rich', or at least 'richer than you'. It's a form of romantic apartheid, which, apparently, is just how successful professional ladies like it. </p> <p>An extensive new study involving two million people, and 700 dating agencies, has revealed that, for the career-oriented modern woman, time is at a premium. According to the director of the study, Professor Richard Scase, '[Women] look at relationships in a very contractual way. They assess a person as you would test-drive a car.' On the positive side, this means that the post-Bridget Jones generation are proactive go-getters, unafraid to give men a taste of their own sexist objectifying medicine, and refusing to chow down with the kind of bozos who disappear when the restaurant bill arrives. A more negative slant would surmise that a new breed of female gold-digger seems to have emerged - the Designer Mercenary, for whom empire-building is everything, and love, lust and fun are just more things to put on the Amex. </p> <p>Power-coupledom has always been around - you only have to read Jane Austen to realise that there's nothing new about the 'good match'. However, in this day and age, it seems a bit feeble of women to go in for what is essentially a form of socioeconomic inbreeding. While it's true that men use these dating agencies, too, let's face it, they'd probably sign up for anything where there's a possibility of sex. And even that seems thrillingly romantic compared to the flint-hearted way women are sizing up men these days. My bet is that, over the next decade, the variably incomed couple will replace the racially mixed couple in terms of rarity, and the rich woman-poor man combo will become the rarest of all. So, who's being the 'bastard' now? </p> <p>You wonder how it started, and whether the more cynical episodes of Sex and the City should be rationed from now on. In defence of Designer Mercenaries, women, particularly thirtysomethings, have suffered some grievous setbacks in recent years. Men who, previously, would have been 'eligible' have been dodging the nets, like so many beer-swilling butterflies. They seem to prefer stuff like sex, fun and autonomy, instead of doing the decent thing, and giving us flash rings, buying us big houses, siring our children exactly when we say, and pretty much doing everything else we demand. Outrageous. Men also seem to have some strange fascination with much younger women who look just as nice, but don't nag, complain, and try to march them up the aisle with a gun to their head. Truly mystifying. Then again, maybe it isn't really. </p> <p>I don't like to be a gender traitor about this, and believe me, I've racked my brains to figure out a way where it could be All Men's Fault. However, just this once, it isn't. It could even be argued that, by being so mercenary, and waving their list of self-serving demands, thirtysomething women are in danger of pricing themselves out of the market. Women are wonderful, but we come in all age groups, and the men who are also wonderful, the 'best catches' if you like, seem to have developed a noted preference for the age group that still knows how to have a laugh. They also get mysteriously attached to women who actually like them, instead of liking what they can do for them. Even more mysteriously, these are the women they marry. </p> <p>Bearing this in mind, it would seem that the 'professionally successful' female opportunist can scheme through 'romantic lunches' all she likes, but only another social climbing desperado would ever fall for it. Modern man, 'professionally successful' or otherwise, seems to have got the Designer Mercenary's number. And not in a good phoning-her-up way. </p> <p> barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "Their spires grace almost every community in these islands. Enter any church, a place of worship and reflection, and the calm beguiles you. By this token, Britain remains a society firmly anchored in religion - Christianity, the native and majority faith, is now just one of a number of faith communities which together provide our moral and religious glue. <p>But the term faith communities gives the game away. Religions as proud as Christianity or Islam do not see themselves as but one of a number of 'faith communities'. Integral to their belief system is the claim that it is by adherence to their codes and systems of worship - and only by such adherence - that the route to happiness and salvation after death can be achieved. </p> <p>And here is the contemporary paradox, the ultimate secularising conclusion of religious toleration. Religions today must respect each other's claim to exist and even recognise each other's underlying morality, but to do so is to surrender the claim that they offer the one true path. </p> <p>Yet the instant any religion acknowledges that God takes more than one form, it concedes that there is more than one guardian of the true flame and thus, by inference, that there are moral choices rather than moral absolutes. </p> <p>Thus, when the ethical and moral balloon goes up, as it did last week over the Government's willingness to allow a free House of Commons vote over the cloning of embryos under 14 days old, the pass has already been thrown. No religion can now claim to teach absolute moral certainties. </p> <p>So, when Scotland's Cardinal Winning and the Vatican thunder that obtaining stem cells from embryos for research is morally wrong because it infringes the sacredness of human life, a sacredness conferred by scripture, they speak from a position that has already conceded its relativism. </p> <p>The Roman Catholic church has tried to hold an absolutist position over the right to life across the body of its doctrine, famously ruling against contraception, but it has lost the fight. It has been reduced to but one faith community that necessarily respects others, a humbler position in the moral universe and which is, paradoxically, founded in the same humanism that lies at the core of science's case to extend the scope of its research. </p> <p>For the trajectory of Roman Catholicism being the moral authority that underpinned every aspect of society - from the monarch' s divine right to rule to the rules over divorce - to its current standing alongside the Church of England and Islam as another faith community exactly mirrors the rise of science and its humanistic project to extend man's power over nature. </p> <p>The terrible religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which still have their echoes in Northern Ireland and Yugoslavia, so obviously breached every religious principle that the solution had to be toleration. The great constitutional settlements in Great Britain (1689), the United States (1789) and France (1793) that, in different contexts, placed the people rather than divinely mandated monarchs as the source of government legitimacy, necessarily enthroned religious toleration as a constitutional right. And intertwined with this rise of democracy and humanist rationalism came the associated right to explore freely the insights of science. </p> <p>Over the last 50 years, the scientifically led breaches in the walls of the old, religiously protected system of morality are legion - and for the same fundamental reason. We are all humanists now. The free vote in the House of Commons will be won and the recommendations of Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, followed, for the same reasons that the battles over the Pill, abortion, in vitro fertilisation, the human genome and all the rest have been won. </p> <p>The moral imperative in a humanist, secular age is to improve the human condition in the here and now; nor can there be any legitimate constraint on permitting scientists to follow where their ingenuity and logic leads them. The doctrine of constraining science because it might endanger the primacy of Christian morality began to collapse when the church tried to ban Galileo exploring the governing laws of the stars. </p> <p>In short, religion has been losing the battle against science, humanism and the march of the rational for more than 300 years - and it will not triumph in the argument over stem-cell research. That does not mean there are not fundamental moral questions raised by where science is leading, but religion is not going to be able to provide the answers. We have to find the answers ourselves. </p> <p>And the flurry of commissions and reports across the West, ranging from the Nuffield Council of Bioethics to President Clinton's council, established in the wake of the cloning of Dolly the sheep, all try to do just that. The Nuffield Council, for example, in a report that influenced the Donaldson inquiry, argued that as the embryos from which the key stem cells are gathered were never destined to become human beings and if the donor egg were freely given, then the potential scientific gains are so enormous that the research must be permitted. </p> <p>If stem cells can be harvested and they subsequently migrate to parts of the body suffering from degenerative cellular disorders - from Parkinson's disease to cancer - and are then provoked to reverse the degeneration, then medicine makes a gigantic advance. To obstruct this research is to prolong unnecessary suffering - and to protect a worldview to which not even its proponents wholly subscribe. </p> <p>This does not mean that research has no limit. The cloning of humans, with its associated overtones of eugenics, horrifies everyone, which is why all those who have looked into the cloning issue are careful to distinguish between research into cellular structures derived from cells that could never have become humans and those which could. </p> <p>To insist that there is no practical dividing line, as religious absolutists do, is to make a profound error; it is to imagine that religion has a status which it no longer has. The religious Right in general and the Roman Catholic church in particular obviously believe that this is an issue on which they have to make a stand - and where they will find popular support. They are wrong. </p> <p>It is true that we are decoupled from old certainties and would love to create some moral anchors like our ancestors possessed, hence the growing interest in environmentalism, natural remedies and new-age fads. </p> <p>But we are damned by our knowledge and the frontiers that science opens up as it continues the quest to explore and control nature. At the same time, we are making our own ethical judgments as we progress. We are human beings. We can do no other. </p> <p>This is not a crisis for science. It is a crisis for religion, whose moral impotence before the march of the rational is again so cruelly exposed.</p>",
  "David Shayler, the renegade MI5 officer, is due to return to Britain tomorrow but legal experts believe his case may never reach court. <p>Shayler, who has been in exile for three years in France after making a series of revelations about the security services, faces arrest and a possible two-year prison sentence when he sails from Calais to Dover tomorrow. The Government, however, is thought to be distancing itself from action under the Official Secrets Act, believing it may not be in the national interest to force a prosecution. </p> <p>It is now believed that Attorney General Lord Williams could intervene to have the case dropped. 'If the Attorney General took the view that a conviction would contravene Shayler's human rights, then that would be a good reason to drop it,' said human rights expert Geoffrey Bindman. The case could be extremely damaging to the Government in the run-up to the election if Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Home Secretary Jack Straw are called as witnesses. </p> <p>Sources close to the case indicated Straw had taken personal control of the Shayler affair. He has instructed all government departments not to intervene under any circumstance. </p> <p>'He has said that nothing proactive should come from Government and everyone is holding their breath to see what happens when Shayler returns,' said one source with responsibility for national security matters. </p> <p>Meanwhile, pressure is growing for a full inquiry into allegations that MI6 officers were involved in a plot to assassinate Libya's Colonel Gadaffi. </p> <p>Shayler's lawyer John Wadham, director of civil liberties organisation Liberty, said that it was clear Ministers did not want to be seen to get involved: 'Again and again I have asked the Government to talk to me about this process and I know they are taking an interest. But it's as if the lights are on, but no one's at home.'</p>",
  "The race to save the crew of the stricken Russian submarine Kursk reached a chilling climax last night when military leaders admitted there was no longer any realistic hope of finding the men alive. The grim statement came as a British rescue mission arrived above where the nuclear-powered submarine sank eight days ago. <p>In a sombre announcement, Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet general staff, told the Russian nation in a special television broadcast: 'Our worst expectations have come true.' </p> <p>He described the tragedy as 'the gravest disaster ... known in the history of the [Russian] submarine fleet' but said rescue efforts would continue none the less. Yesterday Russian rescuers again failed to link up with the stricken submarine trapped 50 miles off the country's northern coast. </p> <p>His broadcast was greeted with anger and grief throughout the country. The President, Vladimir Putin, was attacked yesterday for failing to break the bad news himself. </p> <p>Putin's decision to remain at Sochi, his official holiday residence on the Black Sea for most of the crisis, has been hugely unpopular and is being seen as his first major miscalculation as leader. </p> <p>Former President Mikhail Gorbachev joined the chorus of criticism yesterday, saying Putin had made a 'serious mistake' by not taking control of the rescue operation earlier. </p> <p>The accident has devastated those living and working in the naval bases that litter the north of Russia. </p> <p>In Murmansk, the regional centre and home town of many of the Kursk's crew, people were bitter. </p> <p>'Everybody is furious at how slowly the rescue operation was carried out,' said Lydumila Zaitseva, whose husband is a sailor. 'We have all been badly let down.' At about 4pm yesterday the Royal Navy rescuers, equipped with a state-of-the-art 'mini-sub', reached a position over the Kursk. They hoped to manoeuvre their vessel next to the damaged sub's rear escape hatch and form an airlock through which any survivors could escape. </p> <p>The British team talked to Russian and Norwegian divers already on the scene. The Norwegian divers are likely to descend to reconnoitre the best approach for the \u00a38 million Royal Navy craft, the LR5. </p> <p>The co-ordinator of the Royal Navy operation, Commander Mike Finney, said outside the Ministry of Defence in London last night that a full assessment of the site needed to be carried out before any dive. The Russians had provided the British with drawings of the Kurk's crucial escape hatch. </p> <p>But it now seems certain that the crew of the Kursk are indeed dead. In his statement yesterday Motsak described how the men in its front part of the vessel died instantly in the huge explosion that sent the 14,000 tonne submarine to the bottom of the Barents Sea. </p> <p>'Most likely the whole of the front section has been flooded and the staff in those sections died in the first minutes of the accident,' Motsak said. The dead would have included the captain and almost all the senior officers. The submarine's control centre would have been completely disabled. </p> <p>Motsak revealed that the Russian high command had considerably more information about the condition of those sailors who survived the blast than had been previously thought. </p> <p>Survivors were still hammering messages on the hull of the sub 48 hours after hitting the ocean floor, he said, and appeared to have been trapped in air pockets in the back of the vessel. Motsak described how the stranded seamen banged out desperate signals to warn rescuers that water was leaking in and slowly depriving them of oxygen and increasing the air pressure. </p> <p>For the first time Motsak gave details of what the Russians believe caused the accident. </p> <p>The first theory, he said, was that there had been some kind of collision. 'It is very possible that the cause of the accident was a strong dynamic blow which could have been caused by several factors.' </p> <p>The second theory involved massive flooding following an explosion in one of the submarine's forward compartments. </p> <p>The third theory - and the one that Motsak said he favoured - involved a Second World War mine. Motsak's broadcast revealed that the Russian Navy had discovered six such mines in the last seven years. </p> <p>'I cannot exclude this option,' he said, 'particularly because the initial explosion [on the submarine] was caused by only 100kg of explosive and the submarine does not have such small warheads on its torpedoes.' </p> <p>The Russians' have consistently played down the British team's ability to help. Observers believe that this is a hint that the Kremlin may forbid the Royal Navy team to dive. </p> <p>The Russian authorities' fear of exposing secret military information to the West during a rescue has been cited as one reason why they refused outside assistance for so long.</p>",
  "<p>Only the most trusting workers would go on holiday leaving embarrassing email messages in their computers. But from November there will be additional reasons for clearing out those hilarious exchanges about the boss. </p> <p>A new law will allow employers to read emails and listen to phone message created by their staff, even when the employees are on holiday or off work ill. </p> <p>In a move described as 'alarming' by unions, the Government has bowed to pressure from big business to change parts of the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, which is set to become law soon. </p> <p>Ministers had planned to clamp down on companies' monitoring of staff phone calls, faxes and emails by requiring employers to get the consent of both the senders and receivers of messages. This would have made it illegal for firms to read emails received for people who are away from work. </p> <p>Business organisations reacted furiously, arguing that it would hinder their operations, and the Government has now changed its mind. </p> <p>A Department of Trade and Industry spokesman said the regulations would be altered to 'make it clear businesses are able to monitor communications such as colleagues' email accounts in order to check whether these are business messages that need to be dealt with in their absence'. </p> <p>The unions are furious about the climbdown. Nigel Stanley, spokesman for the Trades Union Congress said: 'While we understand in certain circumstances an employer might need to get access to someone's email when they're away, we are alarmed at the potential abuse of privacy. </p> <p>'We would be concerned that unscrupulous employers will use this as an excuse to fish through people's private messages when their on holiday or on their sickbed.' </p> <p>This is only the latest of privacy issue to be raised by the RIP Bill. Earlier this month, The Observer revealed how the new law would allow the police and other authorities to track people down using information emitted from their mobile phones.</p>",
  "One of the three Ulster Defence Association gunmen who opened fire in a loyalist bar on Belfast's Shankill Road yesterday is a prisoner who met Mo Mowlam on her 1998 visit to the Maze to ask loyalists to end violence. <p>The UDA from the Lower Shankill area was part of a unit which fired at least 11 shots into the Rex Bar, a known haunt of loyalists belonging to the Ulster Volunteer Force. Two men were shot and one was in a serious condition last night. </p> <p>The gunman was released early from the Maze under the terms of the Good Friday peace agreement. He was one of the UDA prisoners who met Mowlam, then Northern Ireland Secretary, during a wave of sectarian assassinations following the murder in the prisoner of Billy 'King Rat' Wright. </p> <p>Yesterday's shooting raised fears that a major feud is about to break out between Northern Ireland's two main loyalist paramilitary terror groups, the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force. </p> <p>The shooting happened during a band parade organised by Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair and his unit of the UDA in Protestant west Belfast. </p> <p>Members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, which is seeking to align itself with Adair's faction of the UDA, clashed with rivals from the UVF outside the Rex Bar about 3pm yesterday. </p> <p>The LVF, along with loyalist bandsmen from Porta-down, fought their way into the bar, which is frequented by UVF supporters. Fistfights broke out and bottles and glasses were hurled across the pub. During the fracas, several UDA members from the Lower Shankill opened fire inside the Rex bar. Up to 11 shots were fired during the clashes. One man is believed to be in a serious condition with bullet wounds to the neck. </p> <p>The fight spilt out into the Shankill Road - the heartland of Ulster loyalism. Children watching the UDA- organised band parade, which had attracted about 10,000 marchers, took refuge in the Co-op store facing the bar to escape the violence. </p> <p>Ten RUC Land-Rovers rushed to the scene to prevent further bloodshed as UVF supporters squared up to their hated LVF rivals. The two organisations have been at war since the beginning of this year, when the LVF murdered Richard Jameson, the UVF's commander in the Mid- Ulster area. </p> <p>But UVF supporters at the scene said they blamed the UDA's Shankill Road unit for inviting the LVF into the area, which they said was bound to lead to trouble. The LVF is confined to Mid-Ulster and has little or no base in greater Belfast. </p> <p>Several UVF men living on the UDA-dominated Lower Shankill estate asked local Ulster Unionist councillors to ensure their safe passage out of the area last night. They fear a major confrontation between the UVF and UDA following the shootings. </p> <p>Shortly before the incident, thousands of UDA men and their supporters marched along the Lower Shankill led by Johnny Adair and 60 masked terrorists, followed by scores of loyalist flute bands. The police, who watched from a discreet distance, made no attempt to arrest or stop any of those wearing masks or paramilitary uniforms. </p> <p>The rally had been organised to coincide with the unveiling of new UDA murals in the Lower Shankill estate. One of the murals was dedicated to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and is close to others celebrating the terrorist exploits of the UDA. The event was described as a 'community event and a celebration of Protestant culture'. </p> <p>The parade and the subsequent inter-loyalist violence illuminates the deep divisions inside Protestant paramilitary groups. Some prominent UDA members and leading figures in the terror group's political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party, were notable by their absence from yesterday's parade. They are concerned that the organisation's west Belfast brigade is sliding back to war and spoiling for a fight with the rival UVF, the most stable and pro-ceasefire of all the Protestant paramilitary groups. </p> <p>If it is confirmed that the LVF carried out yesterday's shooting, this will pose a major headache for Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary. LVF prisoners were released from the Maze prison early last month under the Good Friday agreement - which the terror group did not even support. Shooting up a crowded bar is a clear breach of their two-year-old ceasefire and Mandelson will face calls to impose sanctions on the LVF, including the re-arrest of their prisoners. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a number of people from nationalist west Belfast are being questioned about a hit-and-run incident during which an RUC officer was killed in the early hours of yesterday morning. </p> <p>Reserve Constable William Thompson died after being struck by a blue Renault 18 car on Upper Kennedy Way around 1am. He was part of a police patrol investigating reports of disturbances in Andersonstown Park West</p>",
  "Every morning for the last week, Admiral Vyacheslav Alexeyevich Popov has paced the bridge of the Peter the Great, the nuclear-powered Kirov-class cruiser which is the flagship of the Russian Northern Fleet. Every morning the view has been the same. <p>As the dim Arctic night has lifted, he has seen the same ships rolling with the heavy swell of the Barents Sea, felt the wind tugging at his gold-braided peaked cap and watched the same men send the same inadequate machines into the frigid waters. Three hundred and fifty-seven feet below, on the ocean floor, lies submarine K-141, the Kursk: a 500ft, 14,000- tonne, double-hulled Oscar-II class submarine. On board are an undisclosed number of torpedoes and missiles (each with 1,000lb warheads), two nuclear reactors (each capable of producing as much power as one of the smaller British power stations) and, almost certainly now, the corpses of 118 men. </p> <p>Nine days ago, 45 year-old Gennady Lyachev, the captain of the Kursk, was relaxing in his quarters at the submarine base of Vidyayevo. For a week his crew had been waiting. Now, finally, they had been given the go-ahead. </p> <p>At about 8.30am on Saturday morning, he took the Kursk north down the wide Kola inlet to join the rest of the famed Northern Fleet 50 miles out in the shallow Barents Sea. By 10am it was in position. Around the sub, 33 warships checked and turned and tested their weapons systems under a blank sky. </p> <p>Twelve miles away from the Kursk's position, a Norwegian intelligence vessel, the Marjata, was rolling with the heavy swell. Two American submarines, out playing the Cold War game of Arctic cat-and-mouse with the Russian fleet, were also close by. The Northern Fleet's summer manoeuvres allow the West to judge the capabilities of the Russian navy. But after days of observation nothing of real interest had turned up. </p> <p>At 10.31am on Saturday, something did. Listening devices on the Marjata picked up a muffled explosion. Analysts took it to be a depth charge. But 2 minutes 11 seconds later came a far bigger blast. Even the USS Loyal, an American acoustic data-gathering vessel 250 miles away, heard it. Within an hour the observers noticed the Northern Fleet's deployment change radically. Something dreadful had happened. </p> <p>We know that at 10.29 the Kursk was engaged in a weapons-firing exercise with the rest of the fleet. It would have been at 'periscope depth' - around 100ft. The Kursk has six torpedo tubes in its bows and silos for 12 more missiles - probably SS-N19 'Shipwrecks' with a range of 300 miles - stored along its sides. </p> <p>When it was the submarine's turn to loose one of these formidable weapons, Captain Lyachin would have given the order to fire and waited for the shuddering roar of the outgoing projectile and the reports of his gunners. But it seems that one of the missiles prematurely detonated while firing. Some think it was an SS-N19 in a vertical launcher. Others say it was probably an SS-N16 'Stallion' fired from a torpedo tube in the bows. </p> <p>The explosion blasted a massive hole on the right side of the bows of the sub. The Kursk would have twisted and bucked under the blast and then lurched sickeningly down and to the right as the water jetted in through the torn hull. Anyone in the forwardmost of the sub's 10 bulkheads who had survived the explosion would have been smashed unconscious by the blasting sea and killed almost instantly. They wouldn't even have known they were drowning. </p> <p>In the control room, Lyachin had only a few seconds to react. He would have issued three or four terse orders. 'It's not like the films,' said Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships and a former nuclear submarine captain. 'Submarine captains don't shout.' </p> <p>First, the captain would have ordered the Kursk's ballast tanks to be 'blown' or filled with air to boost the ailing sub's buoyancy. As forward movement also keeps a crippled sub afloat, he would also have ordered the reactors to be cranked up to generate maximum speed. Then, if he had time, he would have paused to take stock. </p> <p>However, he almost certainly did not have time. Even if sailors in the forward bulkheads moved fast enough to shut the water-tight doors the enormous pressure of the water would have simply blasted them open again. Hundreds of tonnes of freezing cold water would been jetting into Lyachin's control room before any emergency procedures could be activated. The veteran seaman simply had no chance to save his ship. Within seconds he was going down with it. </p> <p>With its forward third full of water, the Kursk tipped downwards and headed for the seabed. The explosion ruptured the right ballast tank and the imbalance would have given the sub the 12 to 20 degrees list that Russian officials have reported. </p> <p>A submarine under control would take 95 seconds under normal conditions to dive 350ft. The Kursk, with its 50,000-horsepower reactors driving it down nose first, would have taken less than half that time. Two minutes and 15 seconds after the first explosion, the Norwegian listeners aboard the Marjata recorded a second explosion, far bigger than the first. It was, they said, the equivalent of around two tonnes of high-explosive and measured 3.5 on the Richter scale. It blew out the whole of the front right section of the sub, buckling its hull as far back as the conning tower. By the time of the second blast - almost certainly other munitions going off - the vessel was probably on the ocean floor. No mayday had been sent, no emergency beacons released, no flares sent to the surface. It had all happened too fast. </p> <p>Every ship in the Northern Fleet must have known something terrible had happened. At 11.30am the submarine failed to make a pre-arranged radio contact. Nearly 14 hours later, at 3.21am, the operator of a sonic depth finder on board the Peter the Great informed Admiral Popov that he had registered an 'abnormality' on the seabed. It was the Kursk. </p> <p>Six hours later the first specialist rescue ships were in place above the stricken submarine. For a day the story was kept from the press. Then it leaked. When the questions started coming at them, the navy spokesmen stalled. They were in touch with the crew, they said. There was air and power on board the sub. They were 'confident of a positive outcome'. </p> <p>The truth was very different. When, on Sunday morning, President Putin asked Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev what chance they had of saving the crew, he got a blunt answer. 'Extremely small,' Sergeyev said. </p> <p>From Sunday to Thursday last week a fierce storm battered the Barents Sea. The Kolokol-class diving bells that were the first option of the rescuers were useless as their motherships rolled up and down with the swell. Making a connection to the Kursk's rear escape hatch proved impossible. </p> <p>Instead three mini-submarines were deployed. But though the craft dived round the clock, thick clouds of silt and strong currents made it impossible to find the hatch, let alone connect to it. When - on Friday morning - one of the subs did connect, the crew found that the hatch was so misshapen that an airtight connection was impossible. </p> <p>Now rescue hopes depend on a British state-of-the-art 'Slingsby LP5' mini-sub that is on a private exclusive contract to the Royal Navy. It was only on Wednesday, when Putin finally gave permission for the rescuers to accept Western offers of help, that the sub, its crew and support team were flown in an Antonov cargo plane from Scotland to Trondheim in Norway. From there they have been making their way on a Norwegian ship towards the Barents Sea. For the sailors and their relatives, the LP5 is the last hope. </p> <p>The contrast between the grim 'secret cities' of the north and Sochi's Bocharov Ruchei, the sumptuous sprawling complex by the Black Sea converted into a presidential retreat by Boris Yeltsin, could not be greater. There are tennis courts, swimming pools, cinemas and exclusive beaches. For a week, as the drama being played out under the Arctic seas 2,000 miles to the north gripped the nation, Putin obstinately stayed put. </p> <p>While millions of Russians were glued to their TV screens, watching the drama unfold, the commander-in-chief seemed indifferent to the fate of the 118 Kursk crewmen. His official engagements included appointing new Russian Ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile, sending a 70th birthday card to a well-known actress, and debating Russia's brain-drain with a group of professors. </p> <p>It was five days before he made his first, brief statement on the crisis. On Wednesday, after a 25-minute phone call from President Clinton, he finally gave the green light for the British to get involved. Then, on Friday, he suddenly announced that his first thought when he learnt of the disaster was that he should be there. He didn't go because he didn't want to be in the way, he said. </p> <p>It was a singularly unconvincing performance, coming after two days of unprecedentedly vicious attacks in the Moscow press. But the political logic for his silence is clear. </p> <p>Chatting from Sochi by phone on Tuesday evening with Ehud Barak, the embattled Israeli Prime Minister, Putin is said to have told him that it was already too late for the Kursk seamen. The ex-KGB man clearly thought that putting himself at the head of a lost cause was not going to do his action-man image any good at all. </p> <p>But he miscalculated. His inaction was politically costly. For the first time in his time in power, Putin was seen to falter. The politicians and the senior naval officers, once almost legendary figures inspiring awe and respect, now were the target of very different emotions. </p> <p>Ilya Klebanov, the Deputy Prime Minister who Putin appointed to head the government inquiry into the accident, was mauled by the wives of the seamen who hurled abuse at the authorities, weeping, fainting and screaming at a meeting at the Kursk's home garrison of Vidyayevo, 30 miles from Murmansk. </p> <p>And the admirals' bungling, lying, and arrogance triggered a wave of popular revulsion. The newspapers contrasted Putin's vanishing act with how Western leaders, in the age of television democracy, take charge at times of national disasters or humanitarian emergencies. </p> <p>The top brass and the Kremlin elite just didn't understand, the commentators said. It's the same old story, they alleged. It's the traditional Russian elite's contempt for the lives of Russian servicemen and the suffering of their families. We thought Putin was different, they said. We were wrong. </p> <p>The fate of the Kursk has struck a chord across the nation in a way not witnessed in years. </p> <p>The huge steel tomb on the bed of the Barents Sea has become a symbol of all the grievances, the pent-up frustrations, the anger and the disappointment in contemporary Russia. </p> <p>And while Putin sunned himself in Sochi, the mood inside the navy headquarters in Moscow was getting more bitter by the hour. The atmosphere was 'openly menacing', said a source. 'The admirals are just going through the motions.' </p> <p>'See if the British can do any better,' said one officer sourly. </p> <p>Few now think there will be anyone left for the British to help. Until Tuesday, someone was heard tapping SOS messages on the hull of the Kursk. Since then, however, there has been nothing. No radio contact, no sonar telephone, nothing. </p> <p>Russian officials believe that at least a third of the crew were dead before the Kursk hit the bottom. The areas damaged, and thus flooded, include the sub's accommodation areas. Richard Sharpe, a retired British submariner, believes that the only bulkheads that would have held back the waters are those protecting the twin nuclear reactors in the middle of the vessel. He thinks the rear half of the sub - including the reactor control room and the vast chambers housing the transmission - would have been relatively undamaged. </p> <p>There are usually 20 sailors on shift in these areas. The huge 190-megawatt reactors could provide them with light and clean air and, though they would have been without water and food, they could have sat tight until someone got to them. </p> <p>But, the Russian navy says, the reactors are not running. The emergency shut- down procedures may have been activated by the shock of the accident but experts say that is unlikely. The crew probably closed them down themselves, as they had been trained to do in the event of a disaster or just in the fearful confusion. They would have been unable to restart them. </p> <p>The lights would have gone out and the cold become intense. The water at that depth is almost freezing. It would have been like sitting in a dark, meat fridge at the bottom of a 400ft-deep swimming pool. Within 48 hours the air would have started to go bad. The Kursk's 'air scrubbers' - which process the foul air - would have needed power to function. Any batteries would have been quickly exhausted. Weak and traumatised, the men would be increasingly prone to hypothermia. </p> <p>The build-up of exhaust gases would have made their condition worse. Normal air is 4 per cent carbon dioxide. When the level reaches 5 per cent, severe headaches and nausea start. Co-ordination and mobility start to suffer. When the level reaches 10 per cent most humans lose consciousness. They don't slip away, but lie choking and gasping in pain and terror until the darkness finally closes in. The men in the front of the Kursk died in seconds as a wall of water crushed and filled their lungs with water. The men at the rear followed an identical physiological path, but much, much more slowly. </p> <p>Yesterday, the eighth day of the crisis, residents from the closed town of Vidyayevo, where the Kursk command is based, said that the atmosphere was extremely tense. Relatives of the trapped submariners had gathered in the town, where they were being cared for by counsellors. </p> <p>A special train arrived yesterday morning bringing the mothers of the conscript sailors to the bleak shores were their young sons once lived and trained. </p> <p>The people of Vidyayevo know all about disaster. Eleven years ago, 120 men died when another submarine, the Komsomolets, caught fire and sank. Every year dozens of fresh wreaths are scattered over the sea in memorial. </p> <p>Next year there will be scores more. </p>",
  "A spectre is haunting the Catholics of North Belfast - the spectre of Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair. <p>The muscular, shaven-headed, heavily tattooed Shankill Road loyalist is spotted everywhere along Belfast's so-called peacelines - a series of Berlin-style walls that separate Protestant and Catholic communities in this most dangerous part of Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Catholic residents living in areas such as the Lower Cliftonville Road are seized with panic every time a stranger with a shaved head is seen in a car cruising their streets. Adair, whose unit of the Ulster Defence Association has been behind the recent wave of sectarian attacks on Catholic homes in the city, has engendered a collective paranoia within the nationalist population. </p> <p>Rumours fly that he has been spotted in this district or that. Vigilante patrols and community watch groups have even been set up to look out for signs of loyalist incursions from UDA strongholds across the peaceline. In parts of north Belfast in particular, it is hard to believe there is even such as a thing as a peace process. </p> <p>Anne Marie O'Dwyer lives just yards away from one of the barriers between the Catholic Cliftonville and the loyalist Lower Oldpark, the latter being the area where Adair grew up. The mother of six, who lost both her mother and brother in the Troubles, had only moved into her new home in May. </p> <p>Now she is contemplating leaving the house for fear of further sectarian attacks instigated by the UDA. </p> <p>In the early hours of last Tuesday, Mrs O'Dwyer was woken by what she thought were fireworks: 'I heard these loud bangs around 4am and I looked out. There was a car speeding off from the front of my neighbours' house with four men in. At first I thought it was joyriders, but then when I went outside I realised that someone had fired shots into the neighbours' house. The windows were smashed and there were bullet cases on the road,' she said. </p> <p>In 1976, Mrs O'Dwyer's mother, Sarah, was killed in a loyalist bomb attack, and eight years ago her brother, Michael, was shot dead by a rogue policeman who went berserk inside Sinn Fein's Belfast headquarters killing two other men. </p> <p>Mrs O'Dwyer thought her own 'personal Troubles' were finally over with the ceasefire. Now she is not so sure: 'It's like being dragged back into the past again. I am scared. Some of my children's bedrooms look onto the peaceline and they have been sleeping on mattresses in my room, because they're afraid the loyalists will fire into their rooms.' </p> <p>The gun attack on the O'Dwyers' neighbours came just hours after Johnny Adair alleged that the IRA had tried to kill him in a pipe-bomb attack. </p> <p>However, Sinn Fein, the RUC, rival loyalists in the Ulster Volunteer Force, and even some of Adair's own comrades in the UDA, believe the 'attack' was a ploy to provide an excuse for anti-ceasefire loyalists to return to war on north Belfast's streets - an area which recorded a fifth of all deaths in the Troubles. </p> <p>Mrs O'Dwyer and other residents of this growing Catholic enclave are threatening to leave en masse unless their homes can be secured. According to Manus Maguire, a community worker in Lower Cliftonville trying desperately to build links with Protestant groups across the peaceline, 14 families who are about to move into newly constructed houses are also having second thoughts. </p> <p>'They have told me that unless the housing association, Oaklee, fits the homes with bulletproof windows, steel fortified gates, drop bars on the doors, and panic buttons, they won't move in,' Maguire said. </p> <p>Even with vigilante groups keeping a round-the-clock watch on Clifton Park Avenue, there is palpable fear on the wide streets that end abruptly at the peaceline. </p> <p>Violence often flares on these interfaces during Ulster's marching season, but this summer's disturbances have taken a more menacing turn. </p> <p>It started a fortnight ago when Protestant homes in south, west and north Belfast came under co-ordinated attack. Sinn Fein denied that republicans were involved in any of the incidents. Republicans claim that loyalists stage-managed many of the forays into Protestant areas in order to foment sectarian clashes and provide an opportunity for the UDA to portray itself as the defender of the loyalist people. </p> <p>Standing at the end of Rosevale Street, which ends at the peaceline in front of Lower Oldpark, Maguire said the recent violence was not just a battle for supremacy within loyalism. </p> <p>'It's certainly true that the trouble has only been in interfaces where nationalist areas look onto loyalist areas which are UDA strongholds,' he said. 'But there is another underlying reason for the trouble - many loyalists feel under territorial threat from nationalists in north Belfast. The Catholic population is growing here and the loyalist population is declining, what was once a Protestant stronghold is changing, and they don't like it,' he said. </p> <p>Adair's supporters have already tried to reclaim parts of north Belfast, which many Protestants perceive to be falling into Catholic hands. Carlisle Circus, a roundabout at the bottom of two main thoroughfares, the Antrim and Crumlin Roads, has recently been decorated in red, white and blue paint, UDA flags and sectarian graffiti. Territory is being marked out. Catholics are being told that this 200-yard stretch of road still belongs to Protestants from the nearby Shankill estate. </p> <p>The spectre of Johnny Adair, who continues to protest that he wants peace rather than war, has conjured up other spirits that haunted the recent past. Last Friday night the Irish National Liberation Army, the republican terror group that shot dead Adair's friend, Billy Wright, in the Maze prison, staged a series of armed foot patrols in the nationalist Ardoyne area. The INLA's political wing, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, opposes the Good Friday agreement and is trying to make capital out of the recent disturbances, arguing that the deal has not brought peace to the working-class nationalists in places like north Belfast. </p> <p>The IRSP's Paul Little, who lives in the Lower Cliftonville area and works with the community scheme keeping watch on the peaceline, claims the British Government is turning a blind eye to the Shankill Road UDA's 'war mongering.' </p> <p>'If the INLA was to break its ceasefire in the way the UDA has by shooting up Catholic houses, our prisoners' feet would not touch the ground on their way back to the Maze,' he says. So far the British Government has refrained from answering direct questions about what sanctions it would impose on organisations like the UDA if they are found in breach of their ceasefires. While the vast majority of Catholics living in the Lower Cliftonville still support Sinn Fein's peace strategy, there is growing concern that the recent flare-ups can end only in sectarian assassination; pro-ceasefire loyalists share that worry. </p> <p>One UVF commander described the UDA's machinations as 'a very dangerous game of brinkmanship. They seem to want to take things to the edge and then pull back just before things get out of control and somebody gets killed'. </p> <p>Last Thursday the UDA appeared to be doing just that. Its political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party, announced it would endeavour to 'persuade' the UDA to call off its threat to shoot any nationalist seen attacking Protestant areas and to bring an end to the nightly attacks on Catholic homes. Many UDA brigades are critical of their Shankill Road comrades and share the UVF's concern that they are being led down a disastrous path back to war. </p> <p>In the 1970s the Lower Cliftonville was a favourite hunting ground of the Shankill Butchers, a notorious sectarian killer gang who abducted Catholics from the streets, tortured them and then slashed their throats. </p> <p>This weekend this area is again gripped by fear, with residents wondering when the UDA's 'phoney war' of paint bomb, brick and bottle will escalate into a real shooting war. While Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, David Trimble, the First Minister, and the rest of Ulster's political class relax abroad on their holidays, those living at the sharp end of the Shankill UDA's intimidation are wondering: 'Peace process, what peace process?'</p>",
  "<p>I'm fairly sure as I write this that, in a couple of decades, I'll be looking back at it, kicking myself with a lithe and supple re-cartilaged foot and cursing myself for not having opened the piece with two simple words: Meet God. </p> <p>Or Dr Moreau. It depends which side you're on. But there's little doubt that one day, if all goes as planned, the world will look back to where it began, the day we started to learn to re-grow our own bodies, and we'll be looking with some awe at Professor Liam Donaldson, Britain's ridiculously unassuming chief medical officer. </p> <p>Not for the science itself, for which the credit will span decades. It will go to Edwards and Steptoe, who gave us the world's first test-tube baby ; to Campbell and Wilmut at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, who cloned a sheep and called her Dolly; to Thomson and Shamblott and other Americans who, two years ago, managed to isolate and develop 'stem cells', the adaptable little buggers from embryos that go on to form variously, after some complex genetic cajoling, our spines or brains or nerves or organs. It will also go to yet-unknown scientists who will try to put all the knowledge together and allow us to re-grow our own bodies. </p> <p>But the credit for allowing them to do that, for the vision, will go to Professor Donaldson, 51, who last week, after a year consulting with an expert committee, produced a seminal report, punching a hole in the incredibly taut ethical atmosphere surrounding the issues of both embryos and cloning, by recommending Britain become the first country to legalise a new branch of research. </p> <p>The Government has accepted all the findings, and will allow a free Parliamentary vote at an early opportunity; a number of Tories, church and pro-life groups have already said they will oppose it, but it looks likely to go through. The rest of Europe and America have greeted the announcement with surprise and interest, and may follow soon. </p> <p> Stem Cell Research: Medical Progress with Responsibility isn't the sexiest title for a tract which could change the world; but then again publishers' hearts hardly started galloping when Marx gave them a book called simply Capital. Donaldson and his team recommend, firstly, that British scientists be allowed, under strictly controlled conditions, to begin extracting these magical 'stem cells' from embryos which are a few days old, and study them to find how they go on to develop into our brains or spines or whatever. Secondly, they recommend we allow - again under strict control - 'therapeutic cloning', the creation of human life not through fertilisation of an egg with a sperm but through insertion of a donor nucleus - either from an embryo or, eventually, from an adult patient - into an egg, thus creating a simulacrum, rather than a child, of the original. (Sit up there at the back; it's not that difficult.) The advantages of the latter are two-fold: that embryos can be cloned, thus allowing more stem cell research; and that if this ever bears fruit then adult patients can, briefly, be cloned to allow their own undamaged stem cells to be extracted, 'twitched' into growing into a new heart or brain or nerve cells, then reinserted into the damaged tissue. This could cure Parkinson's Disease, heart disease, spinal injury. It could cure cancer. </p> <p>And eventually, as Donaldson explains gently, sipping his coffee as the rain batters his Whitehall window, they could simply learn how to extract an adult cell, twitch it back to stem-cell babyhood, tell it to grow again properly and put it back in again. </p> <p>This, he says, is 'the Holy Grail'. Not just because of the implications but because it would skirt the huge ethical obstacles around which Donaldson has just negotiated with subtlety, bringing a bedside manner to the boardroom. No embryos would have to be created only to be flushed away ('not the terminology I'd like to be quoted on,' he chides, 'but essentially, yes') after research. No human clones would have to be made. </p> <p>He sighs as I ask whether the criticism has annoyed him. 'There are some misconceptions. We're not talking about cloning whole human beings, the human equivalent of Dolly; it's abhorrent, it's illegal. And we're not growing whole parts of the body; sitting in the lab growing arms and legs and livers. </p> <p>'I understand people having different views on this subject. But I think the use of language such as \"cannibalism\" is very unfortunate, and doesn't help a balanced debate. We're also looking at life that might be saved at the other end of the spectrum.' And that wholly justifies killing it at the start? 'I suppose the straightforward answer to that is that it's already been resolved through proper democratic process.' He means the Warnock committee and the 1990 Act on in vitro research... but what does he himself think? A 14-day-old embryo; is it or is it not life? He pauses, for a long time. </p> <p>'No. Not at that stage, when it's a tiny ball of cells. But that doesn't mean you can do anything with it. You have to accord it respect. But the 14-day rule is a good one, and I don't think it's an area where we'd want to start pushing back the time limit.' </p> <p>He's careful, private; a strong and thoughtful man who's been accused in the past of arrogance and severity - particularly with his (now wholly justified) criticisms of poor doctors - but seems rather affable in the flesh. He tells me, in a rare personal insight, of his time as a young surgeon in the late 60s, trying to cure a child of leukemia at a time when the survival rate was 4 per cent. 'And I remember the mother saying - I want my child to live, not die. Why can't you do that, doctor? And I couldn't. I think of all the diseases the most distressing is cancer.' </p> <p>He seems, however, remarkably dispassionate, as a doctor, about the possibilities of this new research in which he's played such a crucial role; sentences are fraught with caveats, and there's a clinical wind to his words. Where's the excitement? He smiles. </p> <p>'I see myself as principally serving the public. I often have quite difficult tightropes to walk between the medical profession and the Government and as far as I'm concerned the tightrope leads in a straight line to the public; if that from time to time means I upset the medical profession or the Government I'm prepared to do that. So, while I am excited by the potential of this to help people who are suffering, it is not out of unbridled enthusiasm for the development of science in its own right.' He pauses, to formulate a new entry for the book of scientific understatements. 'It is a... a big moment in medical history. It's opening up a new frontier.' </p> <p>I think that's safe enough, even for him. A new frontier. New life; new humans. We will have men, and we will have, if you like, re-grown men, 'late men', And, as the French have always known, you can't make an homme late without breaking eggs. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/news/stemcell/primer.htm\">Stem Cells: A Primer</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/cgr/\">University of Edinburgh's Centre for Genome Research</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lifeuk.org/\">Life</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cegc/\">Chief Medical Officer's Expert Advisory Group on Therapeutic Cloning</a></p>",
  "Danny O'Connor has only one place in his native Larne where he can buy a drink to celebrate the thirtieth birthday of the Social Democratic and Labour Party tomorrow. The party's first ever Assembly member for loyalist-dominated East Antrim will have to confine himself to the local Catholic parish hall if he wants to uncork a bottle and toast the SDLP's founding fathers. <p>For Catholics in Larne, the port town which has witnessed an upsurge in sectarian attacks over the past fortnight, do not drink in the town at night for fear of being beaten up, or even killed, by loyalist gangs. To them, the area's pubs and clubs are no-go areas. </p> <p>O'Connor himself has been at the sharp end of loyalist aggression since he was first elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998. His home has been attacked 12 times since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, and last week his brother's house was petrol bombed. </p> <p>Yet this burly 35-year-old former security guard personifies the SDLP's best strategy to preserve its status as the principal nationalist party of Northern Ireland in face of a formidable threat from Sinn Fein. </p> <p>His working-class roots challenge the stereotype of the SDLP simply being the party of the Catholic middles classes - teachers, solicitors and doctors. Elected to a constituency with an overwhelming Protestant majority, east of the river Bann, his success gives his party some hope that it can keep the IRA's political wing at bay. O'Connor has attracted the first preference votes of former Alliance Party voters and even second and third preference transfers from pro-Agreement Ulster Unionists - something Sinn Fein finds impossible to achieve outside the nationalist electorate. </p> <p>The SDLP Assemblyman's office is a monument to the bigotry that blights Larne. The town has strong historical ties to hardline loyalism dating back to 1912, when the original Ulster Volunteer Force landed 30,000 rifles from the Clyde valley to arm people willing violently to resist Home Rule in Ireland. The windows of the office, above butchers' shop in Main Street, are bullet proof. There are scrapes and marks on the panes from the countless bricks, bottles and ball bearings fired at the SDLP base. </p> <p>Inside last Friday afternoon O'Connor was counselling nervous Catholic families whose homes were petrol bombed last week during an orgy of sectarian intimidation across the town organised by the Ulster Defence Association. </p> <p>Under siege from extreme loyalists, O'Connor takes comfort from the framed photograph on the wall of the American civil rights leader, Martin Luther King , one of his greatest heroes. His other hero is the SDLP leader, John Hume. </p> <p>'There are two reasons why I joined the party seven years ago, he said. 'I used to work as a security guard at Shorts [aircraft factory] and I remember the day that loyalists shot up a minibus full of contract workers who were painting and decorating at the plant. These were guys I used to let into the factory in east Belfast every morning and say hello or good morning to. And then, when that gun attack happened, one of them was dead, wrapped in a blanket that barely covered him. The others were badly injured. </p> <p>'I thought something should be done to stop this madness.' </p> <p>The shooting happened in 1993, when Hume was talking to Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams in an attempt to persuade republicans to give up violence. </p> <p>'John was coming under considerable pressure and criticism but I will never forget watching the relatives of the victims of the Greysteel massacre coming over to him at the funerals and telling him he had their full support to keep on talking. I remember Hume breaking down in tears and that's when I knew I had to join the party,' he said. </p> <p>Like many SDLP representatives living in mainly loyalist areas, O'Connor paid the price for entering politics. Some of the party's early leaders were victims of both loyalist and republican intimidation. Austin Currie, now a Fine Gael TD in Dublin, suffered attacks from the UVF and the IRA. Loyalists bombed Seamus Mallon's home. Former leader Gerry Fitt had to force an IRA-inspired mob out of his house at gunpoint after they broke into his home threatening him and his family. As he waved his legally-held gun at the intruders, one of them shouted: 'Look, he's a coward, he's got a gun.' Worst of all Lord Fitt's friend Senator Paddy Wilson and his friend Irene Andrews were stabbed to death in a frenzied knife attack. </p> <p>O'Connor accepted the risks of being a nationalist representative in a loyalist stronghold. 'The first cases I dealt with were Catholic constituents being burnt out of their homes. The people I represent are under attack and that means I have to stand firm and keep going.' </p> <p>He blames the East Antrim UDA for orchestrating most of the violence directed against him, his family and his constituents. The RUC have told him he is on a loyalist death list. Yet he has founded the first branch of the SDLP in Larne and predicts that the party will elect more councillors to the local borough council next May. </p> <p>West of the Bann, the party is fighting a rearguard struggle against a highly organised, disciplined and well-financed Sinn Fein. In Westminster constituencies such as West Tyrone, it is Sinn Fein rather than the SDLP which is seen as the main challenger to the sitting Unionist MPs. But east of the river dividing Northern Ireland, John Hume's party is clearly making inroads into the Alliance vote and gaining fresh support from the new Catholic middle-class emerging in areas that were once 100 per cent unionist. </p> <p>Optimistically, O'Connor dismisses the prophets of doom who predict the demise of the SDLP and the further rise of Sinn Fein. </p> <p>'The Agreement was pure SDLP politics in practice, compromise and common sense. They've been arguing for a settlement like this for 30 years long before Sinn Fein started to get into real politics. Unlike Sinn Fein I can reach out to others beyond nationalism, to people from Unionist and Alliance backgrounds that voted for the Agreement. All republican violence achieved over 25 years was to drive people further apart.'</p>",
  "Loyalist gunmen were last night accused of launching attempted mass murder at a bar in a Protestant area of west Belfast after a loyalist paramilitary parade. Four people were shot following a confrontation between rival factions. <p>The RUC said about 300 people had attacked the Rex Bar on the Shankill Road. None of the injured was badly hurt. Shots were fired when the crowd was refused entry. </p> <p>A number of houses in the Lower Shankill area nearby were later reported to be on fire after being ransacked. </p> <p>Progressive Unionist Assemblyman Billy Hutchinson claimed the Ulster Freedom Fighters and Loyalist Volunteer Force fired on the bar. Locals claimed gunmen opened fire on rival Ulster Volunteer Force sympathisers. </p> <p>The shooting was being linked to a feud between the UVF and another faction, comprising members of the UFF and LVF, dating back to the murder of Richard Jameson in Portadown in January. </p> <p>Eyewitnesses claimed a crowd of people broke off from the parade which involved members of the Ulster Freedom Fighters/ Ulster Defence Association and ran towards the Rex Bar before shots rang out. </p> <p>The shooting will raise tensions on the Protestant Shankill Road which had a number of houses damaged in an attack 10 days ago, sparking a series of attacks on Catholic homes in Belfast.</p>",
  "As Jim Wallace steps back from the front line after his stint as leader of Scotland's ruling coalition, he is bullish about a Parliament that so far has had an unenthusiastic press and seems to have left the Scottish public distinctly underwhelmed. <p>The Deputy First Minister and Justice Minister is unabashed. He says that from 'a standing start' the Parliament has posted a solid list of achievements. </p> <p>He claims its flexibility, speed of response and working methods have shown Westminster how a modern legislature should conduct its business and left his party, the Lib Dems, in a strong position to contest the next election. </p> <p>Wallace, 46 next Friday, is generally reckoned to have performed well as stand-in for Donald Dewar while the First Minister was off recovering from heart surgery. </p> <p>He has found the period 'challenging'. He explains: 'When Donald first told me, my immediate reaction was that this wasn't part of the script. He quite bluntly said: \"Deputies are there to deputise\".' </p> <p>Wallace had already survived a difficult start. There were sneers that in forming the coalition with Labour he traded principle for a 'ministerial Mondeo'. As Justice Minister, he had to produce emergency legislation to deal with the case of Noel Ruddle, a psychopath released from Carstairs because of a legal loophole. </p> <p>His department has had to respond to the challenges flowing from the European Convention on Human Rights, binding on the Scottish Executive and Parliament from the start. </p> <p>And in April it seemed to observers that Wallace's Labour partners had cynically used him as scapegoat and flak-taker when the coalition abandoned its outright opposition to the Bill, sponsored by Tommy Sheridan and others, to abolish warrant sales, a method of debt enforcement which all parties agree is barbaric and outdated. </p> <p>Wallace, who set out the Executive's position in his opening speech and then found the ground shifting beneath his feet, says he knew that negotiations were going on but that he was 'holding the line'. He explains: 'It looked dramatic, and I'm not pretending it felt comfortable. But in the end of the day what divided us was not a huge issue of principle.' </p> <p>The Executive agrees the system can be harsh and oppressive against people who cannot pay, but is determined not to let 'people who can pay but choose not to' off the hook. </p> <p>The Executive will bring forward its own legislation to replace the warrant-sale system 'within this Parliament'. This is likely to be based on the Scottish Law Commission's report, which in April suggested restricting the circumstances and scope of warrant sales, and reflects the work of a review committee of which Sheridan is a member. </p> <p>Wallace's department has also carried a thorough audit of the impact of the convention and will bring forward legislation in the autumn. He says: 'I'm someone who's campaigned for most of the time I've been in politics to bring the convention into British domestic law. I can see the irony - I never thought I'd be the Minister it would first bite. </p> <p>'But I don't apologise. If you look at the principles of the convention - fairness of trial, right of assembly, right of privacy and so on - they are principles that most people would sign up to. Many of these rights were in the old common law but have been eroded by statute, and can be eroded by statute.' </p> <p>Among the changes flowing from the convention are part-time rather than temporary sheriffs (because the latter did not have security of tenure). 'Yes, we have had disruption. But we will end up with a better system of justice.' </p> <p>He has promised a judicial appointments commission to make the selection of judges beyond reproach. </p> <p>On the Parliament's record, Wallace says with enthusiasm: 'I don't want to look at things through rose-tinted spectacles, but I genuinely think that from a standing start we have made remarkable progress.' </p> <p>MP for Orkney and Shetland since 1983, he is not standing for Westminster next time around. The way they conduct business in Edinburgh, he believes, is 'light years' ahead of Westminster, where he says there is arid point-scoring, procedural delay and the dismissal of good ideas if they come from the wrong quarter. </p> <p>Edinburgh, by contrast, is 'civilised, sensible and modern' and the committee system is developing on genuinely cross-party lines. 'People in Scotland are finding that, if they respond to consultation, their views are taken into account.' </p> <p>It is ironic, he thinks, that Westminster failed to reform Section 28 - because of Tory opposition in the Lords - while Edinburgh has done so. He rejects criticisms that the Executive made a hash of things by failing to consult. </p> <p>Of Stagecoach bus boss Brian Souter, who bankrolled the campaign against reform, he says: 'I respect Brian Souter. I've met him. I think he is sincere in his views. On this particular issue, I disagree with him. What gives me cause for considerable unease is if we were increasingly to find we were living in a country where the whole political debate and issues were determined by people with money.' </p> <p>He claims, as a central achievement of his party's involvement in the coalition, the 'abolition' of student tuition fees. He rejects the notion that the fees haven't been abolished at all, simply deferred. </p> <p>Lying somewhere ahead is the question of proportional representation in local government. Because of growing opposition in the Labour Party, there are doubts whether Dewar can deliver - it is estimated that almost 80 per cent of Labour councillors are against it. Is it a coalition-busting issue? Wallace is cool. In countries accustomed to coalitions, 'coalition-busting issues come up every few weeks'. </p> <p>He explains: 'It's an important issue, though it doesn't necessarily grab the public.' But he says the principle is important for reinvigorating local government, giving it 'parity of esteem' with a fairly elected Parliament. The position in Glasgow, where there is a huge entrenched Labour majority, 'is not just sustainable'. </p> <p>The partnership agreement was that the coalition would 'make progress' on the McIntosh Commission's unanimous recommendation that there should be PR in time for the next council elections. A subsequent report by a committee chaired by the academic Richard Kerley recommended the single transferable vote. </p> <p>'We've set up a ministerial working group to carry forward the Kerley proposals. We know what is in the partnership agreement. Equally, we're sensitive to the views that exist within the Labour Party.' He adds: 'There's no point in forcing the pace today if you're going to lose. You're better to wait for the day after tomorrow and winning.' </p> <p>Is it fair to ask turkeys to vote for Christmas? 'I'm sure that's how a number of Labour councillors see it. We would say there's a much bigger goal to be won - reinvigorating Scottish local democracy. That will not happen under the present electoral system. I hope that, in the broader interests of local democracy, the majority of Labour councillors can be won round.' </p> <p>It is in Wallace's interest to praise the achievement of the Parliament. The Lib Dems went into the coalition promising to make a difference. The party will want to show, come election time, that it has done so. Wallace is even now working on the script.</p>",
  "<p> 'We used to use templates a lot, but not any more,' Jayne says thoughtfully. </p> <p>When Flametree started life, it seemed like a good idea. The templates were part of an off-the-peg web design software package. They would simplify the content editing and management process and allow all staff to edit the site. </p> <p>But templates stifle creativity a bit. And Flametree is keen to expand its horizons. 'In the internet world, templates mean handcuffs,' Chris, the site's content and technical manager, says sternly. </p> <p>So now freelance staff have been brought in to help create tailor-made software systems for the site under Chris's guidance. This has meant a parting of the ways between Flametree and its original web designers. Jayne describes the parting as a 'nightmare with a silver lining', because it has allowed Flametree more control. </p> <p>The bespoke system will allow the site to poll its users - useful for generating new stories to be fed to the press, thereby boosting the company's profile. Jayne is also spreading the Flametree gospel through networking. She has been invited to talk about Flametree at internet and women's events as far afield as Milan and Tokyo. </p> <p>So far Flametree has grown by word of mouth. But now it is about to receive its search engine listings, having almost completed the complicated process it needed to undertake to persuade the likes of Yahoo! to include it. </p> <p>The software will allow for much more interactivity with Flametree's growing army of users. Just after the April launch, Flametree boasted 25,000 page impressions a week. Now the figure is more than 100,000. </p> <p>Users will also soon be asked to fill in brief online questionnaires, which will help Flametree build up consumer profiles. As a reward for their time, some will win a Flametree 'random act of kindness', such as a Shiatsu massage or technical counselling. </p> <p>Jayne and Rosemary are hoping that the company's user base will rocket when Flametree starts its marketing drive next month. An advertising flier is to be slipped into 200,000 copies of a catalogue aimed at parents, and the company is to advertise at the Prima Baby Show later this month. </p> <p>But has its optimism been tempered by the high-profile problems of health and beauty site ClickMango? 'The jury is out as to whether they will really fold. I'm not sure,' Jayne says. 'But given the current investment climate, I'm glad not to be looking for funding. We have enough for a year or more.' </p> <p>Much will depend on the quality of the new marketing and sponsorship managers Flametree wants to recruit soon. Given the way the company is growing, it is just as well the search for new premises now seems to be nearly finished.</p>",
  "<p>Bad breath sufferers all over the world flock to Californian dentist Harold Katz. The 50-year-old self-styled halitosis guru runs clinics all over the West Coast of America that claim to cure this embarrassing condition. </p> <p>But Katz, whose products are found in leading US chemists and supermarkets, breathed new life into his business when he took it to the web. His sites now even invite the friends, family or workmates of people with bad breath to submit the names of sufferers who can't pluck up the courage to confront the problem themselves. The unfortunates are then emailed about ways of solving a problem they presumably did not even know existed. Katz does a roaring trade. </p> <p>This week he will be appearing on UK cable shopping channel QVC, saying that more than 80 per cent of his web customers access his dozen sites via a search engine - software that will list web sites according to a key word or words. </p> <p>'We get most of our business through the web,' says Katz. 'We're selling all over the world thanks to search engines.' </p> <p>But anyone who has used a search engine knows just how frustrating the process can be. A keyword search yields thousands of responses. Wading through lists to find exactly what you are looking for is time-consuming and tedious. </p> <p>Katz ensures his websites always get in the first range of searches by paying <a href=\"http://www.aol.com\" target=\"_new\">AOL</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo!</a> more than \u00a335,000 each year. For this he gets a banner ad whenever someone types in 'bad breath', 'halitosis' or 'fresh breath'. </p> <p>This has a double impact. 'Because so many people see the banner ads on AOL and Yahoo!, the number of hits to my sites increases very rapidly,' he explains. 'Search engines use \"the most frequently visited sites\" as a parameter when listing sites on their search engines. Therefore, though an indirect method, spending money on banner ads helps get me listed higher.' </p> <p>Marketing ploys such as Katz's are at the heart of increasing unease about search engines. For years it has been rumoured that it is possible to buy your way to the top of a search engine list. But no one has ever proved this and the main players, Yahoo!, <a href=\"http://www.altavista.com\" target=\"_new\">AltaVista</a> and AOL, all strenuously, if nervously, deny such claims. </p> <p>But last month the issue came more sharply into focus when a new search engine, called <a href=\"http://www.godado.com\" target=\"_new\">Godado</a>, was launched by Italian Danilo Gasparrini. Godado's business model is brazen but transparent: Gasparrini reckons companies are willing to pay more to get a prominent listing on search engines. So Godado charges firms and displays how much they pay for all to see. </p> <p>'Everyone knows that it's vital for businesses to be visible on the web,' said Gasparrini. 'Surfers don't bother with searching throughout a list. After the first four pages interest tails off dramatically. Prominence comes with a premium. How companies are ranked on search engines is a mysterious operation. It is often shrouded in secrecy.' </p> <p>But what if you can't afford to pay for ads or prominence? There are numerous underhand ways of elevating your search engine position. </p> <p>Other than frequency of hits, search engines rank sites according to how many times key words are mentioned on a site. The oldest trick in the book is typing keywords repeatedly in a text that matches the colour of your site's background. This technique is becoming rarer: search engines are now known to ban sites guilty of doing this - particularly if they are sexually explicit. </p> <p>But 'cloaking' is a more common practice, according to Danny Sullivan, editor of <a href=\"http://www.Searchenginewatch.com\" target=\"_new\">Searchenginewatch.com</a>. Cloaking is a way of deceiving the search engine's 'spider' - the technology that crawls through websites looking for words in documents and then categorising them - by offering it a page not available to normal viewers. This page has far more mentions of the key words attractive to the 'spider' than appear on any real page. </p> <p>Alex Kovach, director of the UK-based <a href=\"http://www.Lycos.com\" target=\"_new\">Lycos</a> search engine, says: 'It's a constant battle combating those who try to manipulate their search engine position.' </p> <p>But it's a battle Lycos thinks it is now winning. It employs a panel of experts throughout the country whose job is to rank the best sites. </p> <p>The editorial panel is responsible for the first 10 results in a search. The next three results are determined by the popularity of sites, and the remainder are based on key words in a site found by Lycos's 'spider'. </p> <p>Whether manipulation can be combated or not, it is still true that search engines often produce results that are irrelevant or too vague. </p> <p>The result, believes Simon Prodger, marketing manager at <a href=\"http://www.xrefer.com\" target=\"_new\">xrefer.com</a>, which is putting leading reference books online, will be new kinds of search engines. </p> <p>'There is a definite perception that search engines are becoming too unwieldy,' says Prodger. 'We are now seeing specialist portals that will provide links and a search engine for targeted community interests.' </p> <p>New software develop ments are in any case threatening the traditional search engines' hegemony. Autonomy, the fast-growing Cambridge-based intelligent software company, last March launched Kenjin, a product that it believes could sound the death knell for traditional search engines. </p> <p>Kenjin is based on technology that can understand and 'contextualise' information. The technology analyses text for meaning, rather than just looking for key words, and then links it to other relevant documents. Similar products are also being released, principally by internet investor BrightStation. </p> <p>Not surprisingly estab lished search engines do not give the impression they are quaking in their boots. 'We have a huge directory,' said Lycos's Kovach. 'We've made huge investments. We are a general and niche resource.' </p> <p>But search engines are suspected of manipulating rankings and are prone to manipulation themselves. What's more, they are unwieldy. So there is a massive opportunity for intelligent software and niche players to cut them down to size. </p> <p>What is more likely, however, is that the big players - Yahoo!, Altavista and AOL - will buy up the niche, subject-specific search engines as soon as they are established.</p>",
  "Three sobbing young women ambushed Uncle Choe from North Korea as he ended a tour of the royal palace in Seoul. Security officers quickly hustled him back on the sight-seeing bus through a media melee. <p>Choe Sang-gil, 68, like all the other North Koreans brought to Seoul for the four-day family reunion, was only allowed to meet five relatives - his nieces were not on the list. </p> <p>Choe sat down in his window seat: the women circled the bus till they found him, then held up two of their children level to his face. For a moment he looked ahead, then dabbed at his eyes. Another minute and he had disappeared - changing seats to avoid a breach of discipline. </p> <p>No home visits were allowed: two elderly mothers were brought by ambulance to a car park to meet their sons. No one was allowed to visit the family grave: much time was spent working out, after 50 years of non-communication, who was still alive. </p> <p>The North-South exchange of 100 divided family members symbolised both the new hope of rapprochement kindled by the June summit and its fragility. Their brief encounter, harassed by the media, is almost certainly the only chance they will get. </p> <p>'I see you are both sobbing,' said a reporter to a couple on the first day, 'I won't disturb you.' Then she asked them why they had separated during the Korean War. </p> <p>How to make good the appalling human and political cost of the war, paid again and again in decades of Cold War folly, raises many questions. </p> <p>Last week's reunion has raised expectations among the hundreds of thousands in the South with lost relatives. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has said there will be two more exchanges this year and then a more permanent solution. This may mean a meeting place somewhere on the 38th Parallel. </p> <p>Everyone believes it will happen because Kim said so. One of the most surprising features of the new euphoria is that North Korea's 'Dear Leader', painted till recently by Southern propaganda as a crazy dictator, is now seen as being a realist and a man of his word. </p> <p>It may be true - for the simple reason that with his industry starved for power, and many people close to starvation, Kim needs the South very badly indeed. </p> <p>'What we've seen recently shows that Kim Jong-il is completely in control of his country, and now seems to be trying to become a Korean Gorbachev,' says a Western observer. 'The question is whether he can avoid Gorbachev's fate. The last thing South Korea wants is for the Parallel to come tumbling down.' </p> <p>South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's 'sunshine policy' is based on helping Kim Jong-il to make a soft landing. The breakthrough has come because Pyongyang is at last convinced of his sincerity. </p> <p>The family reunion has rekindled hope in a country where 50 years of division was preceded by more than 40 years of Japanese domination. 'The Koreans are prickly and fiercely nationalistic,' says a Western diplomat, 'and I can understand why.' He admits that a stronger, more unified Korea is bound to chafe at US patronage. </p> <p>As the reunion ended, the US military agreed to restrict use of a bombing range on the South Korean coast which has provoked protests. </p> <p>The North Korean visitors included many who had voluntarily joined the Northern side in 1950. The South Koreans were narrowed down by computer from 75,000 applicants. But they were all, in the end, elderly Koreans who just wanted to see their families. </p> <p>'Please stay alive until I see you again!,' they cried out as they said goodbye. </p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.kimsoft.com/korea.htm\" target=\"_new\">Korea Web Weekly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.kimsoft.com/dprk.htm\" target=\"_new\">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a></p>",
  "<p>While reporters this week wasted their papers' budgets in Los Angeles covering the shadow puppetry called the Democratic Convention, America's political future was being decided 80 miles south, in San Diego. </p> <p>Here, where a bilious tumble of freeways, McDonald's and Wal-Marts smashes up against the Mexican border, San Diego's 2.6 million residents have been involuntarily enrolled as laboratory rats in a scary economic experiment. Just weeks ago, San Diego became the first city in America to end the regulation of electricity prices. </p> <p>When California's state senate voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote right into the law that domestic prices would fall by 'at least 20 per cent'. No points for guessing what happened. The price for energy rose by 379 per cent compared with last year. </p> <p>Actually, Californians were lucky. I located Beth Emory, former counsel for the agency that runs the daily power auction. She said that on the first hot summer day, when California needed every bit of juice it could find, generating companies bid in their electricity at $9,999 per unit. This was 1,000 times the formerly controlled price of $10. </p> <p>But San Diegans were fortunate. In their greed-crazed rush, the sellers assumed the system's computers could only handle four-digit bids. In fact, the computers would have accepted seven figures, taking bids high enough to bankrupt half the families in the state in one day. </p> <p>I have been able to trace San Diego's economic plague to the original carrier: one Daniel Fessler. Fessler, the Golden State's former chief utility regulator, flew to England some years ago and carried back with him an infatuation with Margaret Thatcher's economic theorems and an unnatural affection for her troubled offspring, the England and Wales Power Pool. </p> <p>The Pool, at around 4pm or so each day, is seized by a clique of electricity companies which crank up prices by as much as 2,000 per cent. Even Britain's somnolent regulators have twigged to the fact that this supposed free-market auction house is, as Ofgem recently reported, a playground for price-fixing and collusion. </p> <p>One suspects California's politicos knew this. After all, the majority of Britain's electricity system is owned by the same US operators that have San Diego by the bulbs, including Enron (Houston), Edison International (Los Angeles), PPL and Southern Company (Atlanta). This week, the last pair took over Hyder, Wales's water and power utility. </p> <p>But something extraordinary has happened in San Diego. Laid-back Californians have leapt off their surfboards and are waving two fingers in the air and chanting 'Boycott!' </p> <p>The electricity companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses are not going to pay. By the thousands and now, apparently, by the tens of thousands, customers have simply continued to pay only the old, lower, prices. </p> <p>Joining the boycott this week: the city's school system, the Council of Churches and even, without a hint of shame, the state senator who sponsored the original deregulation law. </p> <p>In Bolivia, when British-American, owner of the city of Cochabamba's utility, hiked prices and customers boycotted bill payments, the government confronted protesters with bullets and martial law. </p> <p>But in California, protesters were met by panicked politicians. The leftish governor of California, Democrat Gray Davis, drafted an emergency law to knock back prices retroactively by 60 per cent. The state's utility regulators effectively endorsed the revolt by barring San Diego Gas and Electric from cutting off service to customers who refuse payments through October (up to election day). </p> <p>The Governor has launched an investigation into market manipulation. According to consumer advocate Mike Florio, a member of the power system's oversight panel, the governor won't have far to look. There is 'stacking and cramming' (tricks learned in the UK) plus false scheduling and transmission line games that have cost San Diego about $304 million this summer. </p> <p>On one day, for example, an Enron trader sold the state about 500 megawatts of power to go over a 15 mw line, which is like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble. This forced the system operators to make costly emergency purchases, blowing market prices through the roof. </p> <p>The power pirates are stunned by the public revolt. After all, though San Diego prices have skyrocketed to about 10p per kilowatt hour, this is no more than US power companies typically charge their British customers - who endure the fleecing with a stoic shrug. </p> <p>So what has got the beach bunnies up in arms? Amer ica's little secret is that the New World Order of free markets and deregulation is for export only. America has always expected that, within its borders, the public, through state power, should squeeze down the prices and profits of monopoly service companies. </p> <p>The city of Los Angeles owns its own electricity and water system and virtually gives the stuff away. Good. We don't have to put up with World Bank dicta for privatisation and market pricing designed, as we Angelenos say, for the rest of you schmucks. </p> <p>And there's something else. Deep in its commercialised, Disneyfied heart, America still throbs with a certain democratic spirit. Not, as Jonathan Freedland would have it, the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and the Bill of Rights, of toleration and public discourse; I'm talking about the spirit of Charles Bronson and Death Wish, the coiled snake on the Revolutionary Flag: Don't tread on me! </p> <p>Since long before the recent price hike, 46,000 San Diegans have voluntarily paid $15 a year to belong to the Utility Consumers Action Network (Ucan), the sole work of which is to harass, challenge, sue and otherwise drive electricity and phone companies up against the wall. </p> <p>Ucan sponsored the can't-pay-won't-pay radio adverts. And there are other utility-bashing groups. It is the American genius for public vengeance. </p> <p>The San Diego power rebellion, blessed by the state's Democrats, should be one hell of an election platform for Al Gore. After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans, when they controlled the state's government, who passed the deregulation law. But Gore has consumer blood on his hands. </p> <p>Though not something they would put on their campaign posters, Clinton and Gore have promoted California-style deregulation as the model for the entire US. </p> <p>(Let's just note that a big winner in the deregulation game is Entergy of Little Rock, Hillary's former client. On the other hand, another electricity profiteer is Sam Wyly, a man who made wealthy George W Bush even wealthier.) </p> <p>This week, while Al practiced his platitudes to salarymen and retainers inside the convention hall, Ralph Nader came to town to remind Californians that he was a founding father of Ucan. </p> <p>Polls show fed-up Californians giving Nader 10 per cent of the state's votes. If Nader's support holds, Bush will win all of California's electoral votes, and thereby, the White House. </p> <p>It seems unfair that Gore should pay the price for his complicity in the electricity shake-down, especially as George W's buddies joined in the rip-off. </p> <p>But then, given that Gore has also entered the ghoulish contest over who is the strongest supporter for capital punishment, it is only just that his campaign may come to an end in California's electric chair. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "She is a master of disguise and one of Britain's most wanted women. Detectives this weekend appealed for help in tracing Fiona Mont, the 30-year-old daughter of a prominent Sussex Tory family who has been on the run since faking her own death in January. But now, say police, a number of sightings have placed her firmly in Europe. <p> Nicknamed 'The Cat' because of her ability to keep ahead of detectives, Mont has proved expert at evading capture. Police say that by using seduction and charm she has become one of the most sophisticated and cunning fugitives they have encountered.</p> <p> Mont faces charges relating to a huge computer fraud she is believed to have masterminded. Police are reluctant to give specific details of her probable location, as they believe friends and former lovers in Britain are keeping her informed of police progress. Her downfall began last September, when Steve Skerrett decided to buy a computer. A detective constable with Sussex police, Skerrett responded to an advertisement in his local paper and found himself sitting in a basement flat in Hove with Mont and her boyfriend, surrounded by boxes of new, branded computers. </p> <p> He arranged to return the next Monday, but in the meantime spoke to a colleague who had been working on a case in which a computer manufacturer had been defrauded of tens of thousands of pounds of machines. A few calls reinforced their suspicions, and Skerrett returned on the Monday with a search warrant. Skerrett said of his first visit to Mont's flat: 'We started talking about our jobs, and I told them I was a policeman. There was no reaction, not even a flicker. Nothing at all. She was ice cool about it. I think, to be honest, she probably found the idea of selling something to me quite amusing. It's all a bit of a game to her.'</p> <p> While on bail charged with fraud in this case, Mont continued to play games, calling Skerrett up at his office and inviting him out for a drink. He declined. Mont's confidence crumbled only when she attended an identification parade and was picked out by witnesses. Fearful of facing trial and possibly prison, she resorted to desperate measures and faked suicide. Her Rover 820 car was found abandoned on the edge of the notorious suicide spot at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, a week later. Her keys had been left on the edge of the 535ft cliff - it seemed she had thrown herself off. </p> <p> A search-and-rescue operation involving police and members of the Coastguard using helicopters and dozens of boats was launched, but called off after two days when Fiona's mother, Joan, said her daughter had called her. Mont now faces charges of wasting police time and skipping bail, as well as the original fraud allegations. </p> <p>Police now know that, after leaving her car at Beachy Head, Mont fled the country in an aircraft piloted by Graham Hesketh, whose nickname is 'The Baron' and who is wanted by police in connection with a number of offences. It was originally thought the pair used the flight as a ruse to come back to England undetected, but detectives are now convinced they remained in Europe, where they may be engaged in a range of other criminal activities.</p> <p> Mont has also left behind a string of broken hearts. One boyfriend is now in prison near Paris awaiting trial on drugs charges. Another is on bail in the UK. 'She is an extremely clever woman,' said Skerrett. 'She can make herself look like a duchess or a tramp and will use anyone who can be of benefit to her.'</p> <p> For Mont, life on the run is a far cry from her privileged upbringing. Her mother is a prominent local Tory, a former leader of East Sussex County Council and president of the Rottingdean Conservative Association. Her late father, Neville, was a solicitor and former Under Sheriff of East Sussex. Mont was educated at the \u00a36,975-a-year St Mary's School in Brighton, but was expelled because of her delinquent behaviour. Although she has been in and out of trouble with the law ever since, Mont has only two minor convictions and has never been to prison. </p> <p>She frequently uses her background as evidence that she has no need to turn to crime. Mont studied law and worked briefly at a local business centre. Using these skills she has set up companies and is believed to have used accounts which indicate these companies have turnovers in excess of \u00a31 million a year. Police say she used these accounts to apply to various computer companies for lines of credit and order tens of thousands of pounds of goods, which she allegedly sells without ever paying for them. Mont is believed to have pocketed more than \u00a3300,000 in this way in the past year alone. </p> <p>She has allegedly placed dozens of ads in the Yellow Pages for her bogus companies, which have never been paid for. She has legally held passports in a number of different names to disguise her identity. After changing her name by deed poll, she sends off her old passport and applies for one in her new name. As anyone is entitled to change their name as often as they want, no checks are made at the Passport Office to see whether such changes could be used for criminal purposes. She uses a number of aliases, including Frances Montgomery, Alison Miller, Jacqueline Mayhew and Jamina Chadwick. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\"> tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "Britain's most respected independent touring orchestras, opera companies and ballet companies are being undercut and forced out of the market by musicians from eastern Europe. <p>Musicians from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and the former Soviet Union undertake intensive tours of Britain while spending as little as possible on travel and accommodation, enabling them to charge Britain's venues thousands of pounds less than domestic artists. </p> <p>The growing number of eastern European musicians entering Britain has prompted the Musicians' Union to ask the Government to introduce legislation forcing all artists arriving from abroad to charge a standard fee so that they cannot undercut indigenous talent. </p> <p>'We are increasingly concerned about this issue,' said Dennis Scard, general secretary of the Musicians' Union. 'Eastern European musicians are coming here and taking desperately needed work opportunities from our own companies.' </p> <p>Scard believes foreign musicians are often exploited by agents who have charged so little for their services they end up living and travelling in terrible conditions. </p> <p>The Chisinau National Opera of Moldova was criticised by the Performers' Alliance during its recent tour of the UK for performing 40 times during a 44-day visit. The company will be back again from mid-September until the end of November. British artists rarely play more than six dates in a single tour and never perform more than three days in a row without a break. The Polish State Opera of Wroclaw and the National Opera of Rousse, currently touring the UK, have similarly intensive programmes. </p> <p>A leading orchestra from eastern Europe will typically charge around \u00a315,000 for a concert, while a top British orchestra will expect around \u00a328,000. A second-rate eastern European orchestra will charge as little as \u00a38,000 for a single performance. </p> <p>Antony Lewis-Crosby, former chief executive of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and now chairman of the Association of British Orchestras study, believes competition from overseas is forcing UK orchestras to spend more on marketing - leaving them either to take money away from the musicians or charge more for tickets, making them even less competitive. </p> <p>'It's got to the stage where British orchestras can't reduce their prices any more without reducing the quality of their programmes,' said Simon Crookall, director of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. </p> <p>'We no longer do engagements in the north of England, for example, because we can't compete with the foreign orchestras they're bringing in.' </p> <p>The Leeds International Series, which books tours in northern England, has employed four orchestras from eastern Europe for its next season and none from Britain. 'There's a flood of these orchestras coming over here, and it's a matter of great concern to us all,' said a company source who preferred to remain anonymous. 'Much as we'd like to, we just don't have the money to hire any homegrown orchestras.' </p> <p>'I actively try not to promote too many eastern European orchestras specifically because I'm so concerned about the effect they're having on British orchestras,' said Geoffrey Owen, director of Van Walsum Management, one of the UK's main management companies specialising in international orchestras. 'It's impossible for our homegrown orchestras to compete with them, because they accept wages and living and travelling conditions our artists quite rightly will not.' </p> <p>Mary Chambers, associate manager of UK tours at the International Management Group, admits that all of the five large orchestral tours she has organised this season are from eastern Europe. 'There just isn't the demand for British orchestras from promoters,' she said. 'The price difference is only going to become more pronounced because there are so many more orchestras clamouring for a chance to come over here in the future.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Aeroplanes used to be the last refuge from the trill of mobile phones, but now telephone firms are taking handsets to new heights. <p>Revolutionary new British satellite technology means passengers will be able to use their mobiles at 35,000ft next year. CabinCall, developed by BAE Systems, replaces the current wired-in seat phones which airlines use in first class and business class. </p> <p>Airlines hope the new technology will attract high-spending customers, but pilots and passengers' groups fear it will spark outbreaks of phone rage - similar to those on trains - from travellers wanting peace. </p> <p>One BA pilot told The Observer: 'Who wants to watch a movie with some berk shouting down a mobile phone in the next seat? And what happens if your phone goes off while you are asleep? Who will answer it? I predict trouble.' </p> <p>The Air Transport Users' Council says airlines should think about the requirements of all their customers, not just phone users. 'There is no direct evidence that all passengers want to see mobile phones in the cabin,' said Philip Martin, the council's director general. 'Airlines may gain some passengers but lose others by waking them in the night.' </p> <p>But Julia Brookes, editor of Business Traveller magazine, insists passengers will welcome the new service. 'Mobiles are essential these days,' she said. 'Every time I go on the Eurostar I hear at least six high level, multi-million pound negotiations going on. With increasing globalisation of business, a lot of people are paid a lot of money to be available 24 hours a day - even in the air.' </p> <p>BAE Systems, formed when British Aerospace and the defence arm of GEC Marconi merged last year, says pilots can switch off CabinCall for take-off and landing and overnight. Some airlines are planning to introduce mobile-free Quiet Zones. </p> <p>'Most people now use mobiles as an integral part of their working lives and we believe passengers will accept them on planes,' a BAE Systems spokesman said. 'The cabin crew have complete control over the technology, and passengers will not be able to use phones at critical times, but if you are half an hour from landing and want to call someone to say you are late or early, you will be able to do so.' </p> <p>CabinCall uses a transmitter in the roof of the plane to send messages to the ground via satellite. 'It is just like having a transmitter on the roof of your car. It creates a 'cell' which means mobile phones emit very little radiation and do not interfere with the avionics,' the BAE Systems spokesman said. </p> <p>The Scandinavian airline, SAS, is to trial the system this autumn and it is expected to be approved by the Civil Aviation Authority next year.</p> <p><b> john.arlidge@observer.co.uk </b></p>",
  "To manipulate friends and strangers, should you a: tell them what they want to hear, b: twist their arm, or c: let out a laugh? <p>According to research, a laugh can affect people more powerfully than speech, tapping into their subconscious and manipulating reactions. </p> <p>But although laughter is controlling, it is also uncontrolled, the survey found, suggesting that humans evolved the ability to laugh as a means of manipulating others but employ it unconsciously and instinctively. </p> <p>'We use laughter as a mechanism of social influence. We don't use it for the good of the social group. We use it for our own ends,' said Michael Owren, co-author of a study at Cornell University in New York. 'It's one of the most powerful and least understood of all the social tools human beings possess.' </p> <p>Owren and Jo-Anne Bachorowski, a psychologist from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, studied how laughing affects social situations by asking subjects, alone or paired with male and female friends or strangers, to watch funny film clips. Owren said: 'One of the first things we found was that, unlike speaking, people cannot laugh on cue. This suggests that while laughter is used as a tool of control, it is also used unconsciously.' </p> <p>He found that men and women, monitored while watching the orgasm scene from When Harry Met Sally and the 'bring out your dead' scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, used and responded to laughter very differently. 'The amount and kind of laughter really did differ in men and women, but both sexes take advantage of the inherent ability of laughter to engage other people's emotional states. </p> <p>'The acoustic properties of laughter induce the activation of the listener's nervous system in the same way that parents of pre-vocal infants use non-verbal ploys to catch and keep their child's attention.' </p> <p>The study found that women laugh loudest and longest with male strangers, although they do so more frequently and heartily in general with male friends than with female ones. </p> <p>Women laugh most rarely with other females, whether friends or strangers, although men laughed more frequently and with most acoustic variation when with male friends. </p> <p>Owren believes laughter can also spark hostility, wariness and competitiveness in others. People unfamiliar to each other 'tended not to laugh much, suggesting an instinctive reluctance to trigger any hostility and competitiveness between them'. </p> <p>He also found that although a woman laughs most with an unfamiliar man, that man hardly laughs at all. 'This suggests men are instinctively aware of the latent wariness unfamiliar women might feel towards them and are instinctively careful not to trigger that by any overpowering action on their part,' he said. </p> <p>Robert Provine, a psychologist from Maryland University and author of a forthcoming book exploring the use of laughter, believes it is more powerful than speech. 'Laughter directly affects the emotional part of our brains instead of the cognitive, reasoning bits that are influenced by words,' he said. 'In short, laughter is used by people to make others do things.'</p>",

Because you wanted to activate the pension before the age on the policy, Barclays imposed a fee to recoup the charges it reckoned you still owed. </p> <p>But someone at Barclays' call centre mistakenly misled the Friends Provident adviser by giving him the current value, not the (lower) transfer value, of your pension. Barclays knows this because it has found a recording of the conversation. It has now agreed to pay you the difference between the two pension values. As you have already taken the pension, you will receive \u00a33,824 with which to buy another annuity or go on a spending spree. </p> <p><strong> Credit note limit: Knickerbox block</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>My husband bought me underwear from Knickerbox last year but the bra was the wrong size. I returned the set and was given a credit note. I queried the three-month time limit printed on the note but was told not to worry as the note would be renewed if it ran out before I used it. </strong></p> <p><strong>When I attempted to renew it, however, the note was kept and Knickerbox refused to give me another. In effect, they have had \u00a316 of ours for nothing. </strong></p> <p><strong>After one terse letter which restates that the credit note is valid for only three months, all attempts to contact them have been ignored. What can I do?</strong> </p> <p>DL, London</p> <p>Shoppers have no legal right to return goods just because they do not fit or they dislike the colour but, for the sake of good customer relations, many shops will exchange goods. </p> <p>Knickerbox, now owned by Ann Summers, says it will exchange unworn underwear for any reason within 14 days of purchase, and thereafter gives a credit note. It will extend the note for a further three months if there has been a good reason why you could not use it sooner. </p> <p>As you were misled into believing you could extend the credit note, you have cause to complain and the store should have passed you on to the customer services department. I have explained this, and it is now expecting your call. </p> <p><strong> Equitable Life: Should I leave?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> I am 75 in October and must therefore take up my Equitable Life personal pension which I started in 1990. Should I exercise the open market option with another company, as Equitable seems to be in confusion? Or should I take an annuity with Equitable in case, by staying as a member, I might share in any distribution resulting from a sale of the company?</strong> </p> <p>CP, Lustleigh </p> <p>Equitable Life with-profits policyholders earned no annual bonus for the first seven months of this year but this loss will be made up when the company is sold. If by then you have another company's annuity, you will still get the shortfall when it is paid. There might also be a windfall payment from the sale but only if you are still a member. To qualify, you would have to buy a with-profits annuity from Equitable. If you have an Equitable guaranteed option, this would pay more than other annuities but without a widow's benefit, so you might not think it worthwhile. To help you decide if staying is best, get quotes from several annuity providers, or talk to a specialist annuity adviser. </p> <p>Equitable's memorandum of sale goes out tomorrow, and potential purchasers should be known by the end of the year. </p> <p><strong> Selling life cover: The wrong policy</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> I have a whole-life plan with Axa Equity &amp; Law which began in 1993.

Is there anyone who will deal in this sort of policy?</strong> </p> <p>JD, Londonderry</p> <p>You can often get a better price for life insurance policies if, as you tried, you sell on to another investor. This is mainly for endowment policies but you can sell whole-life policies if they are with-profits policies and the insurer allows them to be converted to endowment.

  "<p>There is a parish in Scotland which gives a bursary each year to a Scottish student studying in Scotland who agrees not to touch drink. The sum is only \u00a316 - but that could keep you in mineral water for a while. </p> <p>Even if you have ruled yourself out for that one, there are many other grants, scholarships and bursaries on offer - about 85,000 in fact, totalling about \u00a3100 million, according to Freefund (www.freefund.com), a dotcom which specialises in matching students with these awards. </p> <p>But there are obstacles. Katie Norton of the National Union of Students says: 'The problem is that people don't know these bursaries are out there. And even if they do find out about them, they can be disheartened by a long application process.' </p> <p>Wealthy individuals sometimes leave legacies to support people in difficult circumstances through education. There is the occasional bequest to help people with the same surname, and sometimes money is available to help people from a particular background - stable lads, for example, or women over 60. And there are many, very old bursaries which may have run beyond their sell-by date - such as the barrel of herrings provided once a year to a student in Sweden, a bursary discovered by Freefund. </p> <p>But if Swedish herrings do not appeal, there are many more mainstream sources of help. Choose your course carefully, however. You are far more likely to find a bursary in engineering, sport or music than in English or geography. A shortage of engineering graduates means the Government and employers are eager to support those choosing this. There is a laser firm in Leicestershire, for instance, which provides half a dozen scholarships a year, each worth about \u00a31,500, to local school leavers studying engineering. </p> <p>Many sport and music scholarships are funded for the greater glory of the academic institution. 'Sports scholarships are extremely popular,' says Jamal Benmiloud of Freefund. 'Universities want to encourage people with exceptional talent to represent them.' </p> <p>The high profile of the Oxford and Cambridge boat race each year shows just how useful good rowers are to the universities. But years before the boat race started, the universities were using organists, choristers and other musicians for similar purposes. </p> <p>If you are looking for a scholarship or bursary, start by contacting your local education authority and the university you are applying to. </p> <p>Some universities are keen to help students. De Montfort University, based in Bedford, Leicester, Lincoln and Milton Keynes, set up a scholarship fund two years ago to attract funding from local employers and others. However, Professor Mike Brown, pro-vice chancellor, encourages students to make their own contacts with employers: 'Write to them on spec. The big companies are looking for people with a bit of spark.' </p> <p>Julie Hepburn of Cardiff University Careers Service tells a similar tale. She says many large employers will give some financial assistance to people who do work placements with them before or during university. 'Firms are using work placements as a way of spotting high-flyers,' she says. </p> <p>While some employers expect the student to work for them on graduation, many give grants with no strings attached. But Hepburn warns potential applicants to start making their plans soon. 'Some of the closing dates for these schemes are as early as November,' she says. </p> <p>Schools inspector Chris Woodhead may have attacked universities for providing golf management courses, but many universities clearly see golf as a legitimate area of focus. At least seven universities offer golf scholarships. St Andrew's makes one award of \u00a33,750; Strathclyde offers eight scholarships of up to \u00a3250 a year each. Studying Anglo-Saxon may bring more academic kudos but if you cannot make ends meet, perhaps the 18 holes are worth a look. </p>",
  "<p>Now is the time to bet on sport. The conditions have never been more favourable for making big money from punting on pastimes. At the track, you don't have to pay any tax. And if you bet with the spread betting firms the tax is included in the spread.</p> <p>This prudent Chancellor is happy for sensible sports investors to keep their winnings. Compare and contrast with those fools who invest in What.com and the like. They have to pay dealing costs and when they pick a winner shell out 40 per cent in capital gains tax. A fair and reasonable levy to restrain such reckless gambling.</p> <p> The differing treatment goes back to the courts being unwilling to sully their hands by dealing with filthy gambling disputes. 'Bets are legally unenforceable,' the judges decreed. And so it continued until the early Fifties when Churchill's government attempted to tax professional gamblers. Stupidly, they didn't ring-fence the provision to ensure that gambling losses could only be offset against gambling profits. Every butcher, baker and candlestick maker promptly claimed to be a pro gambler and set off their betting losses against the money they had made from meat, bread and wax. The government gave up. </p> <p>Since then, betting shops were allowed to open so long as they resembled Hades. And everything was fine until Black Monday when some young speculators managed to do all their dough and then some. The Footsie fell hundreds and hundreds of points and the whippersnappers lost hundreds and hundreds of times their money. Decision time for Their Lordships. It is traditionally argued that hard cases make bad law, but in truth it is when the judges' prejudices come into play that duff judgments are spouted. They hummed and they hawed. It looked like gambling but it was done on the stock exchange. So it couldn't be gambling because if it was then... then... everything would be gambling. And then they'd be in a pickle. </p> <p>To avoid such a fate they found that, despite all appearances to the contrary, the young guns hadn't been gambling, their debts were therefore enforceable and they should pay up promptly. They covered up this faulty logic by pointing out that the spread-betting firms were regulated by the Financial Services Act just like stockbrokers et al. Irrelevant, but sufficient. </p> <p>You might have thought that it would follow from this that monies made from spread betting should be subject to capital gains tax just like monies made from other activities regulated by the FSA. Not a bit of it. 'A lot of people ask me that if it's [a spread bet] enforceable then why isn't it subject to Capital Gains Tax?' says Stuart Wheeler, head of IG Index, grandfather of spread betting, professional bridge player, and all-round shrewdie. 'But there is no connection between the two. Nor is it likely that the bets will be subject to tax in the future because the idea of making people pay tax on any betting profits is not a popular one and certainly not an election winner.' </p> <p>The absence of CGT has saved Philip Peters, the star of Tuesday's edition of the much-improved Jackpot television series, a quarter of a million or so in tax because in the past five years he made \u00a3600,000 from spread betting. Peters' career has been picaresque. Here is his CV with, admittedly, somewhat sketchy dates: </p> <p><strong> 1958-1963:</strong> Regular employment. </p> <p><strong> 1963:</strong> Ceases regular employment. </p> <p><strong> 1964:</strong> Having raised his stake money betting on photo-finishes at Reading dogs, realises that good money can be made backing second favourites each-way when there is a long odds-on favourite. 'You'd be getting 6-4 against when it should be 3-1 on,' says Peters. </p> <p><strong> 1965-67:</strong> Works out way to make money on the Tote. 'When the bookies opened they would take any bet on anything and there was no minimum dividend. So if a dog was 8-1 on you'd get the same price for a place. There was nothing very clever about it.' </p> <p><strong> 1967-72:</strong> Refines system and becomes heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I was betting at Hastings dogs one afternoon and realised how little money was gambled on the place pool. It cost me very little to increase the minimum dividend and it worked very well.' </p> <p><strong> 1972-77:</strong> Becomes very heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I had 80 OAPs up and down the country working for me betting 12 of the straight forecast combinations off the track and we were betting the others at the track. We made a lot of money.' </p> <p><strong> 1982:</strong> Wife nags him into getting a proper job on grounds of 'status'. He invests in a company making plastic containers for then new-in-the-kitchen microwave ovens. Dumb move. 'I'm the only person I know who got all his money from gambling and lost it all in straight business.' </p> <p><strong> 1982-94:</strong> A bad dozen years. </p> <p><strong> 1994:</strong> Introduced to spread betting. 'All I had was three years' worth of Racing Posts .' </p> <p><strong> 1994-2000:</strong> Cleans up. </p> <p> He has made his money primarily from betting on the spreads offered on horse-race distances, but has also trousered tidy sums from betting on the bookings index and the corners index. On all three markets he has sold. His reasoning is simple. Most punters find it psychologically soothing for their downside to be limited and their upside to be unlimited. They know exactly how much they can lose and can dream about how much they might win. </p> <p>On the horse-race distances, about 19 out of 20 players would be buyers. Peters, a contrarian at heart, went the other way and turned nothing into \u00a3200,000. He has bad days - there have been a couple of \u00a340,000 losses - but most days are good. He has used the same principles to win on corners and bookings. He has made healthy profits by taking the 'uncomfortable position' where you win a little often and lose a lot rarely and come out on top.</p> <p> On the bookings index, in particular, he has been helped by the usual tabloid hype about card-crazy referees. The punters, whipped into a frenzy as effectively as Rebekah Wade inciting the unthinking majority, can't help themselves and buy away. The market is distorted. As Toby Brereton, chief market-maker at IG Index, says: 'Opposing hype is an extremely good tool for any bettor.' The latest market to attract the Peters Principle has been the time of Premiership goals. The spread makers have underestimated the number of goals in a match and therefore gone too high on the time of the opening goal. Once again, he has been selling and winning as the foolish crowd buy in the hope of that elusive big win. </p>",
  "The earthquake that devastated western Turkey a year ago was one of the great disasters of the past 100 years. Official estimates put the deaths at almost 18,000; unofficial ones are much higher. <p>The real earthquake was followed by a political earthquake that even had the almighty Turkish military worried for its future. Public fury about its sluggish and unco-ordinated response to the crisis was so great it looked as if the nation was going to rise up and take matters into its own hands. In a previously unimaginable move, 58 organisations across the political spectrum signed a manifesto asking the government to admit defeat and allow 'civil society' to assume responsibility for the earthquake victims. </p> <p>What happened next? Well, not as much as some might have hoped. For a few weeks the press talked about human rights, public accountability, internationalism, corruption and the fudging of the official casualty figures. </p> <p>Angry mobs went after the corrupt bureaucrats and construction companies they held responsible for the disaster. A few governors were hounded out of office, along with just about everyone at the top levels of the Turkish Red Crescent. But then, it seems, there were various consultations behind closed doors. Almost all the columnists suddenly remembered that the army was in most ways quite wonderful. Indeed, its response to a smaller earthquake in November was exemplary. By then the government had passed a decree barring most volunteer groups from entering the tent cities. By the end of the year, order had been most definitely restored. </p> <p>One year on, many Turks say only one good thing has come out of the earthquake: the rapprochement with Greece. Istanbul is packed with Greek tourists. In the ferry stations along the Bosporus are huge banners advertising Turkish Maritime Lines cruises to Kos, Rhodes and the Cyclades. </p> <p>Last week rather smaller banners went up to advertise events to mark the first anniversary of the disaster. All were locally organised: 'Daddy State' did not get involved. In Adapazari, one of the worst hit cities, no one is surprised. There are rumours that the MP for a neighbouring city set up a tent after the quake to learn what his constituents needed. But consultative government is still a novel idea. Adapazari has four deputies, but I could find only one person who had had any contact with a deputy since the disaster, and that was only to shake his hand. </p> <p>Although a third of Adapazari's population has left the area and most of its remaining residents expect to be living in 'Japantown', 'Israeltown' and other internationally sponsored prefab compounds in the outskirts for at least another year, it is still a bustling market town, full of new single-storey shopping complexes. </p> <p>But they are surrounded by the tilting, twisted remains of buildings that should have come down months ago. These are still standing, residents say, because they are tied up in court cases - there are 700 pending in this city alone. No one has been charged or received compensation. It is hard to find anyone who thinks they ever will. </p> <p>The house that makes them angriest is one that is still standing. It is a large, old wooden house in the centre of the commercial district that once belonged to the city's founding father. When people walk past it these days, some spit at it. There should never have been a city here. The water table is only a metre below the surface. In the nineteenth century, when the Ottomans decided to make a settlement here for Muslim refugees from the Balkans and the Caucasus, the German engineers they asked for advice told them to stay away from the marshes and build on the hills. But the owner of that wooden house was also owner of the marshes. To better line his pockets, he had the city built on his own land. </p> <p>The new Adapazari, the new assistant governor assured me, was going to be on the hills some 12km away. All the government buildings would be moving there within the year. There were also 7,000 new homes going up, and there would be low- interest loans for those who wanted to build their own. This does not come close to meeting the needs of the city's 200,000 or so remaining inhabitants, but it is a start. And it is undeniable that the local government has looked after its people's basic needs. No one went hungry, and no one was left in the cold. There is a sense of a future here. </p> <p>Eighty miles away in Golcuk, a much smaller city where the devastation per square metre was probably worst of all, the prevailing mood is despair. According to the manager of an internet caf\u00e9, the bulldozing of condemned buildings stopped five months ago and no one is sure why. The city is a ghost town, he and his patrons agree. It is going to be worse next year when the navy, the city's main employer, moves almost everyone stationed here to the Aegean. </p> <p>There is only one sign of progress since my last visit in November. Then half of the 'waterfront', including a children's amusement park, was sitting three metres underwater. This was where the fault came in from the sea. When the earthquake happened, there was massive subsidence. By the time of my visit it had become a sort of anti-beauty spot. No tour of the earthquake zone was complete without it. It had become the defining image of the disaster: in the foreground the Ferris wheel rising out of the water; next to it the carousel and the half-nude Spanish dancer on top of the swing ride. In the background, a row of submerged street lamps leading to the roof of the municipal pool. Beyond it, a ship that had run aground. </p> <p>But now they are busy reclaiming the land from the sea. The Ferris wheel now stands alone on a large stretch of landfill. When the next big earthquake comes, I hope to God that I'm not standing on it. </p> <p>But at least in Golcuk people are still talking about the wisdom of building low on solid foundations and reliable soil. It is a discussion you do hear now and again in Istanbul, and certainly the rich are moving away from the areas of the city deemed unsound. But even they are still living mostly in high-rises, and although there is a subterranean anxiety about the Big One that experts expect to hit Istanbul some time soon, the skyscrapers keep going up. </p> <p>The most flamboyant is the 20-plus-storey monstrosity that destroys the skyline behind Dolmabahce Palace on the European shore of the Bosporus. It was built illegally, allegedly by the mafia, which has prospered so much in recent years that it has, also allegedly, become the real power behind the throne. This is another building for people to spit at. But for the time being, there is not much else they can do.</p>",

  "<p>\u0095 A part-time worker is told that she will be entitled to paid time off for bank holidays - but only if she works them.

Tips count towards the minimum wage calculation if they are centrally pooled by the employer and then shared out.

  "<p>Peshawar is a rough town. Its bazaars are thick with suppressed violence and its traders rarely smile. Five times a day the call to prayer howls through the air in a clatter of static and guttural vowels. At night the roads rattle with automatic gunfire and it is impossible to tell if there has been a wedding or an assassination. </p> <p>Many people die in Peshawar, violently or otherwise. Nobody chooses to end their days there. No one asks for his ashes to be scattered in the churned mud of the Storytellers Bazaar or from the battlements of the Purana Qila, the old fort. To the west of the city, the Khyber Pass leads up through the dusty, rocky hills of the Hindu Kush towards the border with Afghanistan. When the pollution above the city clears, the hills are sharp against a very blue sky. But they are gritty, sullen mountains and no traveller wants his bones to lie among them. </p> <p>Carlos Mavroleon didn't want to die here. Certainly not in the small, claustrophobic hotel room where they found his heroin-soaked body, on 27 August 1998. Carlos didn't want to die anywhere. Perhaps more than at any other time in his incredible life, Carlos wanted to be alive. </p> <p>He had packed it in to his 40 years. The old Etonian heir to a \u00a3100m fortune, he had been a war correspondent, a Wall Street broker, a lover of glamorous women from glamorous political dynasties (the Kennedys) and from less glamorous ones (the Heseltines). He had been a cool, gimlet-eyed war reporter, blowing off the tension of his assignments in the bars and clubs of Notting Hill. He had commanded a unit of Afghan Mujahideen against the Red Army and had been a bodyguard for a Pakistani tribal chief. And, for most of his adult life, Carlos had been a regular user of speed, coke, Ecstasy, heroin and enough pharmaceutical products to stock a large, if specialised, chemist. </p> <p>But through it all, it seems, he knew what he was doing. Carlos was rarely, if ever, out of control. He pushed it to the edge, looked over - and came back again. And again and again and again. Except in Peshawar on that stinking hot August day two years ago. </p> <p>On 7 August 1998, two massive blasts devastated the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and killed more than 200 people. American investigators followed the trail of the bombers from East Africa to Pakistan and on, via Peshawar, into eastern Afghanistan. Thirteen days after the explosions, President Clinton launched 75 cruise missiles against the camps that the CIA believed were run by Osama Bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind supposedly behind the attacks. It was called, slightly optimistically, Operation Infinite Reach, and successfully killed a dozen or so young Pakistanis who were training in the camps as well several blameless old men and a large number of goats. When the missiles went in, I was in Kandahar, a fiercely Islamic city in the desert south of Afghanistan. We heard of the attack at about midnight and I spent much of the night filing to my newspaper. It was only at dawn that I really began to realise the situation. We sat tight in the United Nations compound and listened to the radio and the chanting from the mosque. </p> <p>Feelings ran high in the aftermath of the strike. In Kandahar, it took a long speech from the most senior cleric in the city to stop the mob marching on us. In Kabul, the capital 300 miles to the north, two UN peacekeepers were machine-gunned, one fatally. There were huge demonstrations against the Americans across Pakistan. Reports started circulating in Peshawar that a bounty of $15,000 had been offered by Bin Laden for dead Westerners. </p> <p>Carlos was staying with his family at his father's seaside home in Athens when the missiles went in. He arrived back at his flat in Fulham, west London, to find 12 messages winking at him on the answerphone. Carlos was known to other journalists as a 'shithole specialist'. The worse the war, the deeper the poverty, the nastier the place, the better Carlos liked it. His favourite shithole was Afghanistan. The calls on his answerphone can't have been unexpected. He rang CBS, the American TV network, to accept an assignment for their flagship Sixty Minutes programme. Leslie Cockburn, the producer at CBS, knew him well. 'I can't imagine why you are calling,' he joked when he called her. 'By the way, I have a multiple Afghan visa.' </p> <p>CBS wanted him to get to Peshawar as soon as possible to try to get to the camps. The hardline Taliban militia who ruled much of Afghanistan - including the bit I was stuck in - were not letting any journalists into Afghanistan. To get into the country would mean travelling in disguise. It would be very risky. Even a team of Afghan journalists had been badly beaten up and narrowly escaped execution when they tried the same exercise. But if anyone could pull it off, he could. Carlos called his fianc\u00e9e, a 26-year-old TV researcher who he was due to marry in November, and then rang his father. 'Don't worry, papa, I'll be careful,' he told him. He packed his gear, picked up a $5,000 expenses advance and flew straight out to Pakistan on Emirates first class. He arrived in Peshawar on 23 August and checked into Green's hotel just off the central Saddar Bazaar. He had four days to live. </p> <p> Saddar police station is only a mile from Green's hotel. Ten days after Carlos' death a smiling detective called Nisar Ali Marwat flicked a brown file on to his glass-topped desk and told me to read it. Under a slowly rotating fan, I leafed through the badly typed pages. A heavily moustached sergeant brought sweet, milky tea in stained cups. Another, sitting on a broken chair behind me, played with his handgun while I read, emptying and refilling the magazine with small, snub-nosed bullets. </p> <p>The death certificate was numbered 83/98. It gave the cause of death as 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The autopsy was conducted at 8am on 28 August by Professor Inayatur Rehman Khalil of the Khyber Medical College, Peshawar. Time of death: between 18 and 24 hours before the time of the autopsy. Carlos's body was fully rigormortised and showed no visible signs of violence. All organs were normal. The face and upper part of the chest were 'livid'. There was a blood-stained discharge from the right nostril. The left arm showed a prick-mark in the ante-cubital region and an insulin syringe contaminated with blood lay beside the body. The syringe tested positive for diacetyl morphine (heroin). Carlos's stomach also tested weakly for diacetyl morphine. There were three small packets of drugs in the room. One, opened, was diacetyl morphine. The second was crude powdered opium. The third was an antihistamine tranquilizer called chlorophenaramine maleate. </p> <p>According to the police statements, Carlos was sitting upright on his bed when he was found, a cigarette between his lips. The bloody syringe was on the coffee table in front of him. There was also a blackened coin. He had died of 'heroin asphyxiation'. </p> <p>A press photograph taken of his body as it was removed from the hotel shows a swarthy, good-looking man with tight, black curly hair that made him look much younger than his 40 years and a lean, muscular body. He was stripped to the waist when he died and was wearing baggy, local-style trousers. </p> <p>Another sheet of paper listed his belongings: satellite phone and spare battery, camera charger, British passport B451472, small video camera, Leatherman-style knife/tool, Sony audio recorder, first-aid kit, Maglite torch, tripod and head, Sony shortwave radio stethoscope, four syringes, duty-free pack of Marlboro Lights, sewing kit, video camera battery packs and charger, two shalwar kameez (local baggy trouser and shirt), white local prayer cap, local leather sandals, Holy Koran (translation), books of Islamic history - four, $1,800 in $100 bills, $2,400 in $50 bills, and 12,265 Pakistani rupees [\u00a3150]. </p> <p>I read the list and looked up at Nisar Ali Marwat. The man behind me had put his pistol away. The tea cups had left oily stains on the glass of his desk. He shrugged. </p> <p> When 'Bluey' Mavroleon said goodbye to his son for the last time he cannot have been too reassured by his promise to be careful. Carlos may have been kind, brave, intelligent and charming. But, by ordinary standards, he was not careful. </p> <p>But then Carlos had never lived by ordinary standards. He was born in April 1958 and grew up in the rarefied air of real high society, not the ersatz Hello! version. His father is a Greek shipping tycoon who was once married to Somerset Maugham's granddaughter Camilla. She eventually left him, when Carlos was three, for Count Freddy Chandon, head of the champagne house Mo\u00ebt et Chandon. Carlos's mother, Giaconda, is Mexican. His brother, Nicky, is married to the filmstar Barbara Carrera. The family fortune is estimated at \u00a3100m. Carlos's address book contained phone numbers for Fawn Hall, the secretary at the heart of the Iran-Contra affair and an old flame, Barbara Streisand and Christina Onassis. He went out with Annabel Heseltine, the journalist daughter of the former deputy prime minister for two years. She wanted to marry him. When it became clear that something awful had happened to Carlos, Ethel Kennedy, wife of Bobby senior, rang the White House to find out exactly what was wrong. </p> <p>In 1979, Bluey inherited the family fortune. Carlos grew up in London's Eaton and Cadogan squares and was sent to Eton but, though he did well, hated it. He started to rebel, at first in the ordinary ways; with left-wing politics, music that his parents wouldn't like, soft drugs and drink. But as ever he soon left the ordinary far behind. At 14, he left his privileged world and signed himself into a London comprehensive. </p> <p>After two years of taking a lot of LSD and indulging in 'industrial scale shoplifting', he told his parents he was going to the southwest of France to stay with friends. There were no phones, he said, so they wouldn't hear from him for at least two weeks. He had calculated that would give him enough time to get free. He planned to head to Burma and smuggle rubies. </p> <p>He got as far as Pakistan. High in the Hindu Kush foothills, close to the border with Afghanistan, in lands that are barely controlled by the current Pakistani administration let alone by the British Raj, Carlos did odd jobs - including bodyguard and labourer, learned to speak the guttural language of the Pashto tribesmen who looked after him and converted to Islam. He never contacted his family. They gave him up for dead. </p> <p>After nearly two years, he returned to Britain and Belgravia, thin, sick and still restless. His family welcomed him back, hopeful that his youthful wanderlust was sated. Carlos worked hard to get his A levels, but played hard, too. He moved from amphetamines and acid to heroin. Before long, he had picked up a serious habit which he never entirely shook. </p> <p>He may have been reckless, but he wasn't stupid. He crammed at Millfield, a top public school, and got a place at Princeton University. Not satisfied with that, he applied to Harvard and, on the strength of a successful interview and a fistful of forged references, got in to read politics. With his money and connections, he was soon mixing with the best of America's East Coast society. He was a favoured guest of the Kennedy clan. He had an affair with Mary Richardson, who later married Bobby Jnr, and a short fling with Fawn Hall. </p> <p>From Harvard he went on to Wall Street. It was the 80s and Carlos, intelligent, well-connected and bold, did well. He lived in Manhattan. He made a lot of money. And spent much of it on cocaine and heroin. </p> <p>And yet it wasn't enough. By 1985, the attractions of his Manhattan lifestyle had palled. He flew to Islamabad - the capital of Pakistan - and drove up to Peshawar. It was then the main headquarters and logistics base for the guerrilla groups. He introduced himself to them and convinced them to take him into Afghanistan. It was his first taste of war. Within months of returning to America he had sold the New York apartment and was on his way back to the sub-continent. He was 26. </p> <p> A canal runs through Peshawar. It is full of refuse and dead animals, but the children play in it anyway. By the banks of the canal, in a bungalow set back behind high walls and a courtyard, is the Afghan Media Resource Centre (AMRC). Throughout the Afghan war, it funded journalists' trips into Afghanistan and disseminated the material they collected. It is widely believed to have been set up and supported by the CIA. Carlos used to sleep on its floor between trips 'inside'. </p> <p>One of the films they have at the AMRC was taken in June 1988 near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. I watched it an hour or so after reading through the police report on Carlos's death. A keen young Afghan projected it on to the only wall not covered in pictures of blown up tanks, dead guerrillas or Russian soldiers, burned out villages and downed helicopters. </p> <p>First the camera pans across a field full of Mujahideen fighters. They are waiting to go into action, squatting with their weapons in lines in the sun or standing in the shade of trees. In the background are the mountains typical of eastern Afghanistan. The film flickers, jumps and weaves. A bearded, grinning Carlos appears. </p> <p>'My name is Karimullah,' he says, his voice deep and unaccented. He is wearing the pakol - the beret-like woollen cap of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan - and has four curved magazines and an AK47 slung across his shoulders. He is a head taller than everyone else. His new name means 'blessed by God'. </p> <p>'I am a Mujahideen,' he continues. 'We are making an attack today on the city of Jalalabad. All the Mujahideen commanders have come together for this attack. I am very happy and proud to be with my Mujahideen brothers. Allahu Akbar. God is great.' Karimullah then continues in fluent Pashto. 'I am from London. In London I fought the Jihad with a pen. Now I fight it with a sword. I have come to Afghanistan to take part in the Jihad.' </p> <p>The cameraman asks if when the Jihad is over Carlos/Karimullah will bring his family to Afghanistan. 'Inshallah [God willing],' he replies with a broad smile. Carlos had arrived in Peshawar three years previously. At first he had been involved in the political side of the Mujahideen's struggle, handling foreign journalists and visiting American VIPs, but the urge to be physically involved in the action became too strong. By 1988, he was an experienced fighter and, according to former comrades-in-arms, a good one. </p> <p>'When you go into battle, you do what you are told. Karimullah would do whatever he was asked and do it well,' said one former comrade. Several former fighters said that by the end of his time in Afghanistan, Carlos was in charge of a dozen men and was running ambushes by himself. He was always in the thick of any action and even prayed longer and harder than his comrades. One former Mujahideen remembered how Carlos had gone outside for dawn prayers in a freezing gale and had returned wet through. 'We laughed at him when he came back in, but he just said \"Ahumdilallah [God be praised]\", and lay down again.' </p> <p>In 1989, the Soviets pulled out. The war carried on as the guerrillas took on the Moscow-backed government's forces, but Carlos was becoming disillusioned with the infighting among the various groups. It was time to reinvent himself again. He returned to London and within months had metamorphosed into a war correspondent. At the end of his time in Afghanistan he had worked as a cameraman and had shot footage of frontline action. With that, and his languages and charm, the work was soon rolling in. In 1991, he was in Oman trying to sneak, in disguise, into Kuwait during the Gulf War. He failed, but succeeded in getting into northern Iraq a few months later. The next assignment was Somalia, then the Sudan, Burma, Angola, Rwanda and back to Afghanistan. On several occasions, he found himself back in Peshawar. Twice he tried and failed to use his connections with the Mujahideen to get access to Osama Bin Laden. </p> <p>In the early 90s, he made a number of trips to Somalia for the American networks. Tim Deagle, a journalist who had worked with Carlos in East Africa, said their time together had revealed Carlos as 'a seriously good human being'. 'Despite everything we saw - and we saw hundreds of dead bodies in a day - he never lost his compassion. We went into one village and there were about three people left uninjured and he went around giving out first aid and looking after people. Most would have just taken their pictures and left.' </p> <p>Yet there was a spirit of recklessness in Carlos, a flamboyance, that seemed never to die. Deagle remembered his colleague insisted on a lunch-stop during a particularly chaotic moment during the fighting. 'He had found two lobsters, so we stopped in a field hospital with an army withdrawing around us and cooked them up and ate them with bayonets.' </p> <p>On another occasion, Deagle found Carlos standing on top of a jeep with a pistol in his hand, a huge stack of dollars in the other and a crowd of angry Somali gunmen around him. 'NBC and ABC had asked him to pay off the people they had hired for protection. Carlos told them all they had to pray before he would pay them. You or I would have been executed on the spot, but he got away with it. He always did.' </p> <p>In between trips, he had a number of relationships - 'women just flocked to him' according to his brother - and took a lot of cocaine. He spent time in the clubs and bars of Chelsea and Notting Hill. He read dozens of books, usually classics, and read and re-read TE Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom . He wrote book reviews for the Literary Review . Almost always he managed to keep his addiction hidden. Colleagues who he worked with closely for years never saw him take drugs. There are hints though that he did. Several people in Peshawar told me that he had got into an argument with an Afghan journalist after smoking heroin in Jalalabad. It was in 1996 after a second failed attempt to find Bin Laden. It seems Carlos didn't cope with disappointment well. </p> <p> Green's hotel is gloomy and claustrophobic. Poor backpackers and wealthy Pakistanis stay there, not journalists working for American networks. Carlos's room cost \u00a38 a night and was on the third floor facing east. From its small window there was a view of tangled electricity wires and roofs. </p> <p>Carlos arrived in Peshawar on the evening of Sunday 23 August. He dumped his bags and walked a hundred or so yards to the office of The News - a local paper - to catch up with Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pathan reporter who knows everyone and everything. If Osama Bin Laden wants to talk to the Western world he gives a statement to Rahimullah. So do the Taliban. </p> <p>Rahimullah knew Carlos from the time of the Afghan war and was generous with his advice. He was happy to talk over the various ways to get to the bombed camps, even though he was trying to work out how to reach them himself. Yusufzai told Carlos what he must have suspected: that his only chance was to disguise himself as a local and work his way through the mountains and across the border. The best place to try, Rahimullah said, was from the small town of Miram Shah which is only a score or so miles from the camps themselves. The next day Carlos hired a car - a big Toyota pick-up - and a driver and set off. By nightfall he was at Bannu, a dusty town on the edge of the mountains, by late afternoon on the next day he was in Miram Shah itself. </p> <p>Within hours he was picked up by Pakistani intelligence services. It was the evening of Tuesday the 25th. Though the Pakistani spooks didn't touch him, they scared him. The whole of the country was jittery after the strikes and the intelligence services were more jumpy than anyone. Despite his credentials, he must have had a hard job convincing his interrogators of his true identity and purpose. After a tense and sleepless night he was put on a bus back to Peshawar. As he was not found to be in the possession of heroin when picked up on Tuesday evening, it is fair to assume that he bought the drug after his release from custody. </p> <p>Around 7.30pm the next day, Cockburn, his producer, began calling Carlos's satellite phone. It rang out every time. By the evening, she was very anxious. She called Green's and was told that Carlos had his key and was in his room which was locked. She kept trying the sat'phone. Eventually the hotel staff used a master key to open the door of the room. Carlos was dead on the bed. He had died a few hours earlier. </p> <p> I arrived in Peshawar on the day Carlos died. After three days stuck in the UN compound while the authorities tried to restrain angry mobs in the streets we were finally evacuated by the UN back to Pakistan and I had driven up to Peshawar to cover the story of the missile strikes' fall-out from there. After only a few hours in the city, a local newspaper editor, Faisal Quazi, called me on my mobile to ask if I knew anything about the dead British cameraman. </p> <p>That evening, Peter Jouvenal, a veteran cameraman who knew Carlos from the days of the Afghan war, mentioned over a drink that the dead man had been to Eton. Suddenly everyone wanted an answer to the same question: how did a man with so much end up dying in such a mean and sordid way? Two year's on there is still no good answer. And, as a result, though the authorities have officially closed the file, there are many who believe that the bald facts of the police report and the post-mortem are concealing something more sinister. </p> <p>One thing everyone seems to agree on is that Carlos would have been unlikely to have accidentally overdosed. Nicky Mavroleon pointed out that his brother was an experienced drug user. 'Carlos used to tell me that to him it was like having a drink. When he was having a good time he just wanted to get high... but he always knew what he was doing,' he said. Carlos did have a doctorate in drugs and he was far from unused to the vagaries of the local Peshawar heroin. </p> <p>Also, everyone seems to agree Carlos had not injected for years. Not since 1993 according to his doctor. He had been put off by a friend dying of Aids some years before, his father said. Would he suddenly switch back to syringes? Particularly if, as the police suggest, he had already been smoking the drug. </p> <p>Could he have committed suicide? Rahimullah Yusufzai saw him shortly before he died and said that though he was shaken by his ordeal at the hands of the intelligence men he was not too worried. A CNN cameraman who bumped into him in a Peshawar street later that day said, with no pun intended, that he 'seemed full of beans, really on a high'. </p> <p>'He told us how he had been in prison and seemed to think that it was all very amusing,' the cameraman said. 'He had a cutting from a local paper that said that he was a British spy which he said he was going to have framed.' </p> <p>Everybody who knew him said he was planning to settle down and was as happy as he had ever been. He was to marry in the autumn and was, according to his father, 'devoted' to his fianc\u00e9e. He had also never entirely lost his Muslim faith and in Islam suicide is as great a sin as it is in Catholicism. </p> <p>And it seems strange that he would be taking drugs at all. As an old south Asian hand, he must have known that, at least following his arrest, he would almost certainly be under surveillance? Would he have bought the heroin anyway? So would an experienced drug-user make a major mistake using a method he had given up at a time of his life when more than anything he wanted to be clean and happy? </p> <p>The answer has to be yes. If the suicide scenario is rejected, as it has to be, and the accidental overdose explanation is thrown out too, you are left with nothing but half-baked conspiracy theories. We know that he was tailed throughout his stay in Peshawar and that Green's hotel staff were interrogated by intelligence men both before and after his death. And we know that he was suspected of being a spy. And we can assume the intelligence services, who were tailing him, knew he had bought drugs. But Peshawar breeds conspiracy theories. The basic fact is that there are easier ways to kill someone than making them inject themselves with a deadly syringe. You have to apply Occam's Razor. What is more plausible - an accidental suicide or a plot involving spooks and forced overdoses? In the end, all that you are left with is a grieving family, a brown file on a police chief's desk, a dozen badly typed sheets of paper and the pathologist's 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The most likely scenario is that a bitterly disappointed Carlos turned to the stand-by which had always helped him when he was feeling low. Relatives say that despite his amazing life he actually had very low self-esteem. The heroin was a prop when he felt down.</p> <p> And that afternoon in Peshawar the disappointment must have been acute. He desperately wanted the assignment to work. To have got the footage from the camps would have made him a media star. He was 40, wanted children, wanted to settle down and wanted some conventional respect from his more conventional peers. And having, in the last few years, watched reporters like Carlos working in Iraq, in Sierra Leone, in half a dozen other such places, I have seen, and felt the sense of heroic difference, the adolescent joy at your distance from the nine-to-five, from the office, from the suits. Heroin gives you that distance, too. If, when he returned to Green's hotel, Carlos momentarily lacked it he wouldn't for long. To start with he would have felt a mellow, sleepy high as the drug triggered the release of dopamine in his brain. It is quite likely that, if he started off smoking the drug, he would welcome the rush of an injection straight into the bloodstream. If you haven't been using the drug for a while the rush is, one regular heroin user tells me, intensified. A wave of contentment overcomes you. Things stop mattering. For Carlos, by the late afternoon of 27 August 1998, as the towers of Peshawar's mosques stretched their shadows across the superheated roofs of the city and the loudspeakers crackled into the Maghreb prayer, nothing mattered at all. </p> <p>I left Pakistan earlier this year. Every week I get calls from old friends and contacts in Peshawar and Islamabad. Recently, I have been asking if anything new has turned up on Carlos's death. People have forgotten it now, and these days I am offered friendly advice rather than information. 'Let sleeping ghosts lie,' said one police officer I know. </p> <p>If Carlos has a ghost it is unlikely to be sleeping.</p>",
  "<p>You have got to like him, he wants you to so much. But boy, it doesn't come easily. You wince as that honeyed voice drips compliments in your ear, telling you it's so kind of you to fly all the way to Barbados to interview him. It's like having margarine massaged into your hair. You start off knowing you'll dislike him, knowing you'll resist him - and indeed you do dislike him, you do resist him - but slowly, remorselessly he wears you down, because his will to win you over is greater than your will to resist. It is the art of the seducer, and he was a great seducer in his day. But you don't necessarily feel very good about yourself afterwards. </p> <p>This is his tragedy - he wants so much to be liked, but the more he tries to be liked, the more he irritates. You think of AA Gill's remark: 'Every mannerism drips insincerity and smarm.' He knows it and is puzzled by it - 'I've tried all my life to please people and make people think I'm a nice guy.' But he's like a doorstep salesman, the more he tells you this Monkhouse product is really wonderful, reliable, harmless, good value, the more you back away saying 'Not today, thank you' and finally slam the door in his face. I believe the pattern was set in childhood - he once said of his parents, 'I didn't seem to be able to get their attention, and the more I did, the more distant they became.' </p> <p>On the face of it, he seems more normal than most comedians - not enormously fat, nor dwarfishly small, he doesn't have a high squeaky voice or a ludicrous toupee. His barbecued skin colour is explained by the fact that a) he lives much of the year in Barbados so is genuinely suntanned but b) suffers from vitiligo - white patches on the skin - which he has to cover with make-up. 'Beneath my underpants,' he tells me, 'I'm a riot of polka dots and moonbeams.' In the flesh, he seems older, meeker, smaller, tireder than on screen, but it is still hard to believe that he is 72. </p> <p>His youthfulness is the more surprising given that he drinks like a fish - two bottles of wine and half a bottle of malt whisky a day. Before he goes on stage, he likes to have 'a large one - I mean a sodding great whisky - and after I've been on stage for half an hour or 35 minutes I can feel that kick in, I get that surge from the sugar. And when I come off I go back to the booze because that's my reward.' A few years ago, he suffered an 'infarction' when his face temporarily slid south, but he was back at work within the week. He takes an enormous array of health pills and potions every day - vitamin E, and ginseng and saw palmetto and pygaeum and milk thistle and melatonin and dozens more. But not St Johns Wort or Prozac because, 'I don't need any kind of mood enhancing. I don't get depressed, I'm more or less continuously equable.' </p> <p>This is a constant refrain - that he is permanently sunny, never anxious, never depressed, never angry. He says that's why he loves Barbados - because it's 'goofy', just like him. But the more you learn about him, the more you think not quite so simple, sunshine. This is a man who used to keep more than a thousand tins of food in his house because they made him feel safe. He would eat one of them occasionally 'though it hurt me to do so', but eventually the tins started swelling like footballs and exploding - pork and gravy splattered all over the walls - so he had to chuck them. Then he moved on to bookmatches - 'which was really nerdish' - followed by films, Capo di Monte China - but only the works of Giuseppe di Capo, made between 1940 and 1962 - and original comic cartoons, Peanuts , Pogo , Blondie , Popeye and especially Krazy Kat 'which was the greatest comic strip of all time, drawn from 1911 to 1944 by George Herriman who was a genius'. He says that nowadays he doesn't really need to collect because 'I justify every breath I take by fulfilling the needs of others', but in the past it was a case of somehow validating himself with possessions - 'I collect therefore I am.' Weird, anyway. </p> <p>But, of course, what he mainly collects is jokes, millions and millions of them - he probably knows more jokes than anyone alive. He has them all written down in eleven ringbinder files and he suffered great grief a few years ago when two of the files were stolen, but he got them back eventually. Moreover, he has an eidetic memory so that, if, as he's going onstage, someone tells him there's a table of firemen to his left, he can mentally flick through his files for the section of firemen jokes written in red and recall that 'A miniature village in Bournemouth caught fire and the flames could be seen nearly three feet away'.</p> <p> This is why younger comedians worship him - he's like a walking comic reference library. I must say his gags don't do much for me, though I like his joke, 'They laughed when I said I was going to be a comedian... They're not laughing now.' He says, probably accurately, that he is not a great original comic genius like his heroes Laurel and Hardy, or WC Fields or Ken Dodd. Rather, he has a moderate talent which he has worked and worked all his life to improve. He thinks nothing of spending two years polishing a joke but when he gets it right, when he gets it perfect , he will never change it. And he never gets bored with delivering it - 'Not if it's a joy to do. If the gag is such a nifty piece of work, you can't wait to do it every night, you know.' </p> <p> The first sign that there was more to Bob Monkhouse than the wisecracking smoothie-chops that met the eye was an In the Psychiatrist's Chair he did in 1992. He has since suppressed the interview - he wouldn't let Professor Anthony Clare reproduce it in any of his books - but it was an astonishing encounter, in which he claimed his mother hated him and then broke down when Clare suggested that, on the contrary, her fierce possessiveness proved she loved him very much. The Clare interview was followed by an autobiography, Crying with Laughter , published in 1993, which was an equally devastating mix of bland showbiz anecdotes and harrowing emotional revelation spiced with semi-pornographic sexual reminiscence. Max Bygraves called it 'the sleaziest book of the year' but it was certainly a memorable one and well above the normal rut of showbiz memoirs. </p> <p>His mother didn't want him to go into showbiz because she said it was vulgar and dominated by Jews. Most comedians in those days came from working-class backgrounds, but he came from affluent Beckenham and went to Dulwich College public school. His father was a chartered accountant, a freemason and pillar of his City guild. He hoped that Bob would work in the family custard business, but Bob's only interest was comedy. He was hugely fat as a boy, unable to play games, and spent all his time in his bedroom writing gags and drawing cartoons. He published his first cartoon when he was 12 and sold a joke to Max Miller when he was 15 - by the time he left school at 17, he had quite a thriving cottage industry as a gagwriter, cartoonist and purveyor of pulp fiction. After national service in the RAF, he wangled himself an interview with the BBC and was soon appearing on radio and television as 'the British Bob Hope'. </p> <p>He would do pretty well anything to get work. He learned Yiddish so that he could do Jewish charity functions but he also joined the Freemasons because Cyril Stapleton, the conductor of the BBC Show Band, advised him to, and Stapleton was an important contact. He joined all three political parties so that he could be booked at their functions (though now that he is famous he considers it 'very unwise' to support a political party). Anyway, his efforts bore fruit and by the time he was 27 he was a star. </p> <p>But his private life was unhappy. He was his mother's favourite - but she was an emotionally frigid woman who never hugged him, and told him off for screaming when he broke his leg because 'What would the neighbours think?' When he married at 21 she wore black to his wedding and then didn't speak to him for 20 years. His marriage to a Belfast nurse quickly went sour, but he remained married for the sake of their first son Gary who was born severely handicapped by cerebral palsy. Gary couldn't hear or speak or walk, but he could communicate by drawing with his foot. They also had a second son Simon and an adopted daughter, Abigail, by whom he now has two granddaughters. </p> <p>Monkhouse was wildly promiscuous throughout his first marriage and his autobiography is full of fantastical sexual adventures - orgies with 'showgirls' and two-way mirrors and handcuffs, often with a slightly masochistic slant. In his younger years, he was famous for his collection of pornography and his appetite for blue humour - one of his old colleagues told me he was known for having 'the dirtiest mouth in showbiz, and that's saying something'. In his book, he claims to have slept with literally hundreds of girls, including one transsexual, and to have had an affair with Diana Dors, but he implies that this was only because his first wife was unfaithful - really he wanted to be monogamous. </p> <p>His first wife eventually left him in 1966, and he fell in love with his secretary, Jackie, and married her in 1973. She is a big cheerful sensible woman who is always at his side - he said it felt odd leaving Jackie for three hours to have lunch with me. Jackie, he says, changed his life. Until he fell in love with her, he thought himself to be emotionally empty, unfeeling, hollow at the core. He had so thoroughly learned to repress his emotions that they only erupted occasionally in strange physical manifestations - piles and boils and eye infections when he was anxious, or a terrible stammer from grief when his grandfather died. When his son Gary was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, he started having terrible migraines which only stopped with Gary's death in 1993; when his wife went into labour with their second son, he burped continuously till the baby was safely born. But this all changed when Jackie gave him her unconditional love - 'the intensity of that approval had a tremendously healing effect on me'. </p> <p>It was Jackie who persuaded him to write and make peace with his mother so that he was allowed to put his arms around her before she died in 1971. But in the meantime, his mother had prevented him seeing his father when he was dying, and also stirred up a long-standing estrangement from his brother John. There was, recently, a slight rapprochement when John wrote to congratulate him on his OBE in 1993, but they have basically spent all their adult lives as strangers. Now the history of family grudges has moved on to the next generation - his younger son, Simon, a teacher, doesn't speak to him and is not referred to by name anywhere in his autobiography. Monkhouse told the Mail four years ago that 'He's not married, he's not gay, he's just isolated' and went on, 'I wonder whether it may have crossed his mind that I have a limited number of years left. And perhaps he feels he should mend the bridges... Otherwise, once I'm dead, he's going to feel very bad.' It sounds like his mother's attitude - let the child come crawling for forgiveness. </p> <p>Of course, a comedian's relationship with his family must always be strange. In his second book of reminiscences, Over the Limit , published last year, Monkhouse includes a diary entry for Christmas 1994 when his daughter Abigail announces that she is pregnant. He writes: 'Our first grandchild is on the way. I tell them that this means more than the joy of grandparenthood to me - it means a whole new subject for comedy material. No one laughs.' </p> <p>Well I bet they don't, given the general tenor of his jokes about the family. Of course, many of them are standards - 'My father only hit me once - but he used a Volvo.' But some of them are a bit queasy-making, especially a routine he does about American Indian names, 'Only last week I ran into my first wife, Crazy Bitch. With her new husband, Nutless Wonder. On the way to visit her mother, Cow That Will Not Die.' Well, haha, sort of - except that his mother-in-law died by drowning herself in his swimming pool when suffering from depression so Cow That Will Not Die is peculiarly - and I do mean peculiarly - inappropriate. </p> <p>He doesn't see it. He believes that comedy exists in a bubble world completely divorced from reality. 'My entire act is a fiction. Jackie once said years ago that for every thousand insults the fictitious wife gets on television, she gets another diamond. And it's perfectly true - those jokes buy the diamond.' So is this another joke or is he saying Jackie's a gold-digger? You can't quite tell because maybe he can't tell - there is an undercurrent of anger, resentment, in many of his jokes, but he would say that's normal, that's the convention. And indeed maybe it is and maybe that's precisely what's wrong with the old-fangled comedy he represents - it paints an ugly world of downtrodden men and harridan wives and ungrateful children and vicious mothers-in-law. Even when funny, the cumulative effect is depressing and I can see that if you were a member of his family, you might want to keep it at arm's length. </p> <p>My trying to discuss this produces in him a rare flash of irritation and, for a second, the air between us crackles with hostility. Obviously, he has put me down as a stroppy feminist with a sense-of-humour bypass. But no sooner has he done it, than he moves to appease me. He quotes Tom Lehrer - a comedian I am old enough to remember - saying that 'Twenty years ago, there were all sorts of words you couldn't say in front of a girl - nowadays you can say all the words, but you mustn't say girl.' This is very typical Monkhouse. He has flicked through the filing system of his mind and found exactly the right joke to disarm me. But although I laugh, I also feel cheated - I wanted to have an argument, and he fobbed me off with a joke. </p> <p> But this is how he is - this is what his comedy is for . He must maintain his equability at all costs - no argument, no confrontation, no unpleasantness must be allowed to upset it. If necessary, this means blanking out any memories that don't fit the bill. There is a weird story in Over the Limit about how once, doing cabaret, he lost his temper with a heckler and strode into the audience and punched the man to the ground, and then carried on with his act. But he only knows he did it because people told him afterwards - he couldn't remember a thing. There is an even weirder story about how he was once hypnotised into buying a nightclub, whereby he lost a lot of money. It's as if he can't admit that he was outwitted by a conman - he prefers to believe that his mind was somehow magicked away. </p> <p>He suggested to Anthony Clare that this blanking-out started with the birth of Gary, his disabled son. He would do all the physical chores, clear up his messes, sit with him on the loo, while smiling and laughing and writing comedy routines in his head. He had to be cheerful, because otherwise he might cry. Nowadays, he does a lot of charity work with disabled children, and he says the last thing they want is sympathy, so he puts on his happy face and goes round dispensing jokes which is now such second nature he can't really switch off. But I was fascinated to see in his sitting room in Barbados, among all the smiley pictures of Bob and Jackie and his daughter and his two granddaughters (no sign of his son) one most atypical picture of Bob looking thoughtful and sad. Jackie told me it was taken at his 70th birthday party when he was unaware of the camera. 'Yes,' he says wryly, 'an emotion slipped out.' I can see why Jackie likes this photo - it's much more human than the grinning rictus of his public face - but obviously wrong for his professional image as a comedian. </p> <p>And a comedian is what he is and hopes to be till he dies. He sees no reason ever to stop - he says approvingly that when Arthur Askey had his leg amputated at 82 he told his agent that he could still play Long John Silver - 'and he meant it, that's what's so wonderful. I'm the same.' </p> <p>He is still doing Wipeout , the daytime quiz show, and hustling for a new Lottery series. And now he is bobbing up in a new unlikely guise as presenter of a BBC Choice series called Bob's DIY Film Show , intended for amateur filmmakers. It is produced by Iain Ross and a young team from BBC Scotland, and Ross says they all loved working with Bob - 'He was so hyper enthusiastic, he was up for everything and he has this amazing memory so he can do everything in one or two takes. We just had a great fun time.' Monkhouse recalls that once when he made a suggestion, the film crew all applauded and he thought they were taking the mickey, but they weren't. </p> <p>He likes working with very young people - he shares their driving energy and slightly anoraky enthusiasm. He says with amazement that some comedians seem to start flagging in their sixties - he can't imagine ever doing that. He likes to 'maintain a presence' on TV because if you drop off the box (vide Little and Large, Cannon and Ball, Keith Harris and Orville) then your cabaret bookings dry up. But what he really loves is performing to live audiences up and down the country - preferably up because northern audiences are always the best. </p> <p>His diary in Over the Limit records the sort of salesmen's shindigs that are meat and drink to him - Antler Luggage at the Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, Safeguard Systems at the Hospitality Inn, Brighton, Everest Double Glazing at the Royal Lancaster, London; InterCyber Computers at the Ramada Hotel, Heathrow.</p> <p> I said surely now he's in his seventies he doesn't have to schlep round the country doing that sort of thing, but he was aghast, 'Oh! I can't turn down work ! Because I enjoy it and, oh, the satisfaction! Just before Christmas, I worked December 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 all over the map, and I remember I was coming home walking on air . I was getting a standing ovation night after night! And that still has the same kind of kick for me as when your favourite teacher puts a big tick at the end of what you'd written.'</p> <p> Moreover, he turns up at these functions two or three hours early so he can learn all the names of key personnel and 'customise' his material. 'That's interesting work, that engages my attention enormously, much more than doing a crossword. Why other people don't do it, I do not know, because you get five times the laughs. But I occasionally talk to other comedians about this and my view is not wildly shared - a lot of them perform by rote. I don't think I could do that. The great thing about being a stand-up comic is that you are master of all you survey - provided you're not failing - you are captain of your destiny. That's a pretty euphoric state to be in, and I've never lost that feeling of sustained glee.' </p> <p>When he was a young man, both Ted Ray and Arthur Askey, whom he wrote for, told him, 'You'll never be a real comedian till you're 40.' 'And I thought Why? Because I had cracked it at 27 and I was doing well at 28, 29. I didn't know then that a laugh wasn't a commitment. I thought if someone laughed at you, that meant you'd won them. I hadn't of course, that's rubbish. And it was only at the age of about 42 or 43 that I suddenly hit form and knew exactly what I was doing and I came to realise what my relationship was with the audience - to take charge of this group of people, make them laugh, make them grateful, impress them with warmth and friendliness in a way that would mean that they would like me, not merely laugh at the jokes.' So do we like him? I fear we must.</p>",
  "<p>Submission is making a come-back. 'We scrub your floors the old-fashioned way,' boasts the brochure from Merry Maids, the largest of the residential-cleaning services that have sprung up in America in the past two decades, 'on our hands and knees.' </p> <p>Recently, I spent three weeks as an employee of The Maids International in Portland, Maine, cleaning, along with my fellow team members, approximately 60 houses containing a total of about 250 scrubbable floors - bathrooms, kitchens and entryways requiring the hands-and-knees treatment.</p> <p> It's a different world down there below knee level, one that few adults voluntarily enter. Here you find elaborate dust structures held together by a scaffolding of dog hair; dried bits of pasta glued to the floor by their sauce; the congealed remains of gravies, jellies, contraceptive creams, vomit and urine. Sometimes, too, you encounter some fragment of a human being: a child's legs, stamping by in disgust because the cleaner is still there when he gets home from school; more commonly, the electrolysed calves of the female homeowner. Look up and you may find this person staring at you, arms folded, in anticipation of an overlooked stain.</p> <p> In rare instances she may try to help in some vague way or apologise for the leaves shed by a miniature indoor tree. Mostly, though, she will not see you at all and may even sit down with her post at a table in the room you are cleaning, where she would remain unaware of your existence unless you were to crawl under that table and start gnawing away at her ankles. </p> <p>Housework, as you may recall from the feminist theories of the 60s and 70s, was supposed to be the great equaliser of women. Whatever else women did, we also did housework. If men thought of the home as a site of leisure and recreation - a 'haven in a heartless world' - this was to ignore the invisible female proletariat that kept it cosy and humming. We were on the march, or so we imagined, united against a society that devalued our labour even as it waxed mawkish over 'the family' and 'the home'. </p> <p>We railed against husbands and boyfriends who refused to pick up after themselves, who were unaware of housework at all, unless of course it hadn't been done. Wherever second-wave feminism took root, battles broke out between lovers and spouses over sticky countertops, piled-up laundry, and whose turn it was to do the dishes. The radical new idea was that housework was not only a relationship between a woman and a Hoover or an unmade bed; it also defined a relationship between human beings, typically husbands and wives. Hence the feminist perception of housework as one more way by which men exploit women. </p> <p>We rejected the servant option. There already were at least two able-bodied adults in the average home - a man and a woman - and the hope was that, after a few initial skirmishes, they would learn to share the housework graciously. </p> <p>A couple of decades later, however, the average household still falls far short of that goal. True, women do almost half the amount of housework they did before the feminist revolution and the rise of the two-income family - a decline that reflects a relaxation of standards rather than a redistribution of chores. Yet women still do two-thirds of whatever housework - including bill paying, pet care, tidying and lawn care - gets done. The inequity is sharpest for the most despised of household chores, cleaning: in the 30 years between 1965 and 1995, American men increased the time they spent scrubbing, vacuuming, and sweeping by 240 per cent - all the way up to 1.7 hours per week - while women decreased their cleaning time by only 7 per cent, to 6.7 hours per week. In the UK, a survey of British parents in 1996 revealed fathers spend an average of two hours cleaning per week, compared to 13.25 hours by mothers. </p> <p>These averages conceal a variety of arrangements, of course, from minutely negotiated sharing to the most clich\u00e9d division of labour, as described by one woman I heard of, who recently said: 'I take care of the inside, he takes care of the outside.' But perhaps the most disturbing finding is that almost the entire increase in male participation took place between the 70s and the mid-80s. Fifteen years after the apparent cessation of hostilities, it is probably not too soon to announce the score: in the 'chore wars' of the 70s and 80s, women gained a little ground, but overall, and after a few strategic concessions, men won. </p> <p>Enter then, the cleaning lady. Marriage counsellors recommend her as an alternative to squabbling, as do many within the cleaning industry itself. A cleaning woman quotes one of her clients as saying that if she gives up the service, 'My husband and I will be divorced in six months.' </p> <p> When the trend toward hiring out was just beginning to take off, in 1988, the owner of a Merry Maids franchise in Arlington, Massachusetts, said: 'I kid some women. I say, \"We even save marriages. In this new 80s period, you expect more from the male partner, but very often you don't get the co-operation you would like to have. The alternative is to pay somebody to come in...\"' Another Merry Maids franchise owner has learned to capitalise more directly on housework-related spats: he closes a third of his sales by making follow-up calls Saturday mornings, which is 'prime time for arguing over the fact that the house is a mess'. The micro-defeat of feminism in the household opened a new door for women - only this time it was the servants' entrance. </p> <p>The cleaning industry is booming. Among my middle-class, professional-women friends and acquaintances, including some who made important contributions to the early feminist analysis of housework, the employment of a maid is now nearly universal. Strangely, or perhaps not so strangely, no one talks about the 'politics of housework' any more. The demand for 'wages for housework' has sunk to the status of a curio. Among feminist sociologists, housework has lost much of its former cachet - in part, I suspect, because fewer sociologists actually do it. The home, or at least the affluent home, is finally becoming what radical feminists in the 70s only imagined it was - a true 'workplace' for women and a tiny, though increasingly visible, part of the capitalist economy. And the question is: as the home becomes a workplace for someone else, is it still a place where you would want to live? </p> <p>The 'cleaning boom' is concentrated among chains such as Merry Maids, Molly Maids, Mini Maids, Maid Brigade, and The Maids International - all named, curiously enough, to highlight the more antique aspects of the industry, though the 'maid' may occasionally be male. These corporate cleaning services have abolished the mistress-maid relationship. The customer hires the service, not the maid, who has been replaced by a team of two to four uniformed people, only one of whom - the team leader - is usually authorised to speak to the customer. The maids' wages, their taxes, their backaches, and childcare problems are all the concern of the company, meaning the local franchise owner. If there are complaints on either side, they are addressed to the franchise owner; the customer and the actual workers need never interact. Since the franchise owner is usually a middle-class white person, cleaning services are the ideal solution for anyone still sensitive enough to find the traditional employer-maid relationship morally vexing. </p> <p>Dan Libby, my boss at The Maids, confided to me that he could double his business overnight if only he could find enough reliable employees. To this end, The Maids offers a week's paid vacation, health insurance after 90 days and a free breakfast every morning consisting of coffee, doughnuts, bagels and bananas. Some franchises have dealt with the tight labour market by participating in welfare-to-work projects that not only funnel employees to them but often subsidise their paycheques with public money, at least for the first few months of work (which doesn't mean that the newly minted maid earns more, only that the company has to pay her less). The Merry Maids franchise in the city where I worked is conveniently located a block away from the city's welfare office. </p> <p>Among the women I worked with at The Maids, only one said she had previously worked as an independent, and she professed to be pleased with her new status as a cleaning-service employee. She no longer needed a car to get her from house to house and could take a day off - unpaid, of course - to stay home with a sick child without risking the loss of a customer. I myself could see the advantage of not having to deal directly with the customers, who were sometimes at home while we worked and eager to make use of their supervisory skills: criticisms of our methods, and demands that we perform unscheduled tasks, could simply be referred to the franchise owner. </p> <p>But there are inevitable losses for the workers as any industry moves from the entrepreneurial to the industrial phase, probably most strikingly, in this case, in the matter of pay. At Merry Maids, I was promised $200 for a 40-hour week, the manager hastening to add that 'you can't calculate it in dollars per hour' since the 40 hours include all the time spent travelling from house to house - up to five houses a day - which is unpaid. The Maids International, with its straightforward starting rate of $6.63 an hour, seemed preferable, though this rate was conditional on perfect attendance. Miss one day and your wage dropped to $6 an hour for two weeks, a rule that weighed particularly heavily on those who had young children. </p> <p>In addition, I soon learned that management had ways of shaving off nearly an hour's worth of wages a day. We were told to arrive at 7.30am, but our billable hours began only after we had been teamed up, given our list of houses for the day, and packed off in the company car at about 8am. At the end of the day, we were no longer paid from the moment we left the car, though as much as 15 minutes of work - refilling cleaning-fluid bottles, etc - remained to be done. So for a standard nine-hour day, the actual pay amounted to about $6.10 an hour, unless you were still being punished for an absence, in which case it came out to $5.50 an hour. </p> <p>Nor are cleaning-service employees likely to receive any of the perks or tips familiar to independents - free lunches and coffee, cast-off clothing or a Christmas gift of cash. When I asked, only one of my co-workers could recall ever receiving a tip, and that was a voucher for a free meal at a downtown restaurant owned by a customer. The customers of cleaning services are probably no stingier than the employers of independents; they just don't know their cleaning people and probably wouldn't even recognise them on the street. Plus, customers probably assume that the fee they pay the service - $25 per person-hour, in the case of The Maids franchise - goes largely to the workers who do the actual cleaning. </p> <p> The most interesting feature of the cleaning- service chains, at least from an abstract, historical perspective, is that they are finally transforming the home into a fully capitalist-style workplace, and in ways that the old wages-for-housework advocates could never have imagined. A house is an innately difficult workplace to control, especially a house with 10 or more rooms like so many of those we cleaned; workers may remain out of one another's sight for as much as an hour at a time. For independents, the ungovernable nature of the home-as-workplace means a certain amount of autonomy. They can take breaks (though this is probably ill-advised if the homeowner is on the premises); they can ease the monotony by listening to the radio or TV while they work. </p> <p>But cleaning services lay down rules meant to enforce a factorylike - or even conventlike - discipline on their far-flung employees. At The Maids, there were no breaks except for a daily 10-minute stop at a convenience store for coffee or 'lunch' - meaning something like a slice of pizza. Otherwise, the time spent driving between houses was considered our 'break' and the only chance to eat, drink or (although this was also officially forbidden) smoke a cigarette. When the houses were spaced well apart, I could eat my sandwich in one sitting; otherwise it would have to be divided into as many as three separate, hasty snacks. </p> <p>In a customer's house, nothing was to touch our lips at all, not even water - a rule that, on hot days, I sometimes broke by drinking from a bathroom tap. TVs and radios were off-limits, and we were never, ever, to curse out loud, even in an ostensibly deserted house. There might be a homeowner secreted in some locked room, we were told, ear pressed to the door, or, more likely, a tape recorder or video camera running. At the time, I dismissed this as a scare story, but I have since come across ads for devices like the Tech-7 'incredible coin-sized camera' designed to 'get a visual record of your babysitter's actions' and 'watch employees to prevent theft'. It was the threat or rumour of hidden recording devices that provided the final capitalist-industrial touch: supervision. </p> <p>What makes the work most factory-like, though, is the intense regimen imposed by the companies. An independent, or a person cleaning his or her own home, chooses where she will start and, in each room, probably tackles the most egregious dirt first. Or she may plan her work more or less ergonomically, first doing whatever can be done from a standing position and then crouching to reach the lower levels. But with the special 'systems' devised by the cleaning services and imparted to employees via training videos, there are no such decisions to make. </p> <p> <strong> In The Maids' 'healthy touch' system, which is </strong> similar to what I saw of the Merry Maids' system on the training tape I was shown during my interview, all cleaning is divided into four task areas - dusting, vacuuming, kitchens, and bathrooms - which are in turn divided among the team members. For each task area other than vacuuming, there is a bucket containing appropriate cleaning fluids, so the biggest decision an employee has to make is which fluid and scrubbing instrument to deploy on which kind of surface; almost everything else has been choreographed in advance. When vacuuming, you begin with the master bedroom; when dusting, with the first room off the kitchen; then you move through the rooms, going left to right. When entering each room, you proceed from left to right and top to bottom, and the same with each surface - top to bottom, left to right. </p> <p>Deviations are subject to rebuke, as I discovered when a team leader caught me moving my arm from right to left, then left to right, while wiping Windex over a French door. It's not easy for anyone with extensive cleaning experience - and I include myself in this category - to accept this loss of autonomy. But I came to love the system. First, because if you hadn't always been travelling rigorously from left to right it would have been easy to lose your way in some of the larger houses and omit or redo a room. Second, some of the houses were already clean when we started, at least by any normal standards, thanks probably to a housekeeper who kept things up between our visits - but the absence of visible dirt did not mean there was less work to do, for no surface could ever be neglected, so it was important to have 'the system' to remind you of where you had been and what you had already 'cleaned'. </p> <p>No doubt the biggest advantage of the system, though, is that it helps you achieve the speed demanded by the company, which allots only so many minutes per house. After a week or two on the job, I found myself moving robotlike from surface to surface, grateful to have been relieved of the thinking process. </p> <p>The irony, which I was often exhausted enough to derive a certain malicious satisfaction from, is that 'the system' is not very sanitary. When I saw the training videos on 'Kitchens' and 'Bathrooms', I was at first baffled, and it took me several minutes to realise why: there is no water, or almost no water, involved. I had been taught to clean by my mother, a compulsive housekeeper who employed water so hot you needed rubber gloves to get into it and in such Niagara-like quantities that most microbes were probably crushed by the force of it before the soap suds had a chance to rupture their cell walls. </p> <p>But germs are never mentioned in the videos provided by The Maids. Our antagonists existed entirely in the visible world - soap scum, dust, counter crud, dog hair, stains and smears - and were attacked by damp rag or, in hardcore cases, by a scouring pad. We scrubbed only to remove impurities that might be detectable to a customer by hand or by eye; otherwise our only job was to wipe. Nothing was ever said, in the videos or in person, about the possibility of transporting bacteria from bathroom to kitchen or even from one house to the next. </p> <p>Instead, it is the 'cosmetic touches' that the videos emphasise and to which my trainer continually directed my eye. Fluff out all throw-pillows and arrange them symmetrically. Brighten up stainless-steel sinks with baby oil. Leave all spice jars, shampoos, etc, with their labels facing outward. Comb out the fringes of Persian carpets with a pick. Use the vacuum to create a special, fernlike pattern in the carpets. The loose ends of loo paper and paper towel rolls have to be given a special fold. Finally, the house is sprayed with the service's signature air freshener - a cloying floral scent. </p> <p>When I described the 'methods' employed to cleaning expert Cheryl Mendelson, she was incredulous. A rag moistened with disinfectant will not get a countertop clean, she told me, because most disinfectants are inactivated by contact with organic matter - ie, dirt - so their effectiveness declines with each swipe of the rag. What you need is a detergent and hot water, followed by a rinse. As for floors, she judged the amount of water we used - one half of a small bucket - to be grossly inadequate, and, in fact, the water I wiped around on floors was often an unsavoury gray. </p> <p>Yet the point at The Maids, apparently, is not to clean so much as it is to create the appearance of having been cleaned, not to sanitise but to create a kind of stage setting for family life. And the stage setting Americans seem to prefer is sterile only in the metaphorical sense, like a motel room or the fake interiors in which soap operas take place. </p> <p> But even ritual work takes its toll on those assigned to perform it. Turnover is dizzyingly high in the cleaning-service industry, and not only because of the usual challenges that confront the working poor: childcare problems, unreliable transportation, evictions, and prior health problems. As my long-winded interviewer at Merry Maids warned me, and my co-workers at The Maids confirmed, this is a physically punishing occupation, something to tide you over for a few months, not year after year. The hands-and-knees posture damages knees, with or without pads; vacuuming strains the back; constant wiping and scrubbing invite repetitive-strain injuries even in the very young. </p> <p>In my three weeks as a maid, I suffered nothing more than a persistent muscle spasm in the right forearm, but the damage would have been far worse if I'd had to go home every day to my own housework and children, as most of my co-workers did, instead of returning to my motel and indulging in a daily after-work regimen of ice packs and stretches. Chores that seem effortless at home, even almost recreational, quickly turn nasty when performed hour after hour, with few or no breaks and under relentless time pressure. </p> <p>So far, the independent, entrepreneurial housecleaner is holding her own, but there are reasons to think that corporate cleaning services will eventually dominate the industry. New users often prefer the impersonal, standardised service offered by the chains. The trend toward outsourcing the work of the home seems, at the moment, unstoppable. For a fee, new firms will also pick up dry cleaning, babysit pets, buy groceries, deliver dinner, even do the Christmas shopping. With other firms and individuals offering to buy your clothes, organise your financial files, and wait around in your home for the plumber to show up, why would anyone want to hold on to the toilet cleaning? </p> <p>Barring a major souring of the economy, there is every reason to think that we will become increasingly reliant on paid housekeepers and that this reliance will extend ever further down into the middle class. For one thing, the 'time bind' on working parents shows no sign of loosening: people are willing to work longer hours at the office to pay for the people - housecleaners and baby-sitters - who are filling in for them at home. </p> <p>Another trend impels people to hire outside help: fewer Americans know how to clean or even to 'straighten up'. I hear this from professional women defending their decision to hire a maid: 'I'm just not very good at it myself', or 'I wouldn't really know where to begin.' Since most of us learn to clean from our parents (usually our mothers), any diminution of cleaning skills is transmitted from one generation to another. Upper-middle-class children raised in the servant economy of the 90s are bound to grow up as domestically incompetent as their parents and no less dependent on people to clean up after them. Having cleaned the rooms of many overly privileged teenagers in my stint with The Maids, I've come to the conclusion that the American overclass is raising a generation of young people who will, without constant assistance, suffocate in their own detritus. </p> <p>Almost everything we buy is the product of some other person's suffering and miserably underpaid labour. I clean my own house (though I have to admit I recently hired someone else to ready it for a short-term tenant), but I can hardly claim purity in any other area of consumption. I buy my jeans at shops which are reputed to subcontract to sweatshops. I tend to favour decorative objects no doubt ripped off from scantily paid Third World craftspersons. Like everyone else, I eat salad greens just picked by migrant farm workers, some of them possibly children. So why should housework - as I have found in conversations with liberal-minded employers of maids - arouse any special angst? </p> <p>Perhaps because we all sense that there are ways in which housework is different from other products and services. First, in its inevitable proximity to the activities that compose 'private' life. The home that becomes a workplace for other people remains a home, even when that workplace has been minutely regulated by the corporate cleaning chains. Someone who has no qualms about purchasing rugs woven by child slaves in India or coffee picked by impoverished peasants in Guatemala might still hesitate to tell dinner guests that, surprisingly enough, his or her lovely home doubles as a sweatshop during the day. You can eschew the chain-cleaning services, of course, hire an independent cleaner at a generous hourly wage, and even encourage, at least in spirit, the unionisation of the house-cleaning industry. But this does not change the fact that someone is working in your home at a job she would almost certainly never have chosen for herself - if she'd had a college education, for example, or a little better luck along the way - and the place where she works, however enthusiastically or resentfully, is the same as the place where you sleep. </p> <p>It is also the place where your children are raised, and what they learn pretty quickly is that some people are less worthy than others. Even better wages and working conditions won't erase the hierarchy between an employer and his or her domestic help, because the help is usually there only because the employer has 'something better' to do with her time, as one report on the growth of cleaning services puts it, not noticing the obvious implication that the cleaning person herself has nothing better to do with her time. In a merely middle-class home, the message may be reinforced by a warning to the children that that's what they'll end up doing if they don't try harder in school. Housework, as radical feminists once proposed, defines a human relationship and, when unequally divided among social groups, reinforces pre-existing inequalities. Dirt, in other words, tends to attach to the people who remove it. Or, as cleaning entrepreneur Don Aslett told me with some bitterness - and this is a successful man, chairman of the board of an industrial cleaning service and frequent television guest: 'The whole mentality out there is that if you clean, you're a scumball.' </p> <p> To be cleaned up after is to achieve a certain magical weightlessness and immateriality. Almost everyone complains about violent video games, but paid housecleaning has the same consequence-abolishing effect: you blast the villain into a mist of blood droplets and move right along; you drop the socks knowing they will eventually levitate, laundered and folded, back to their normal dwelling place. The result is a kind of virtual existence, in which the trail of litter that follows you seems to evaporate all by itself. Spill syrup on the floor and the cleaning person will scrub it off when she comes on Tuesday. Leave the newspaper scattered around your airplane seat and the flight attendants will deal with it after you've deplaned. Spray toxins into the atmosphere from your factory's chimneys and they will be filtered out eventually by the lungs of the breathing public. A servant economy breeds callousness and solipsism in the served, and it does so all the more effectively when the service is performed close up and routinely in the place where they live and reproduce. </p> <p>In a more generous social order, housekeeping services would be subsidised for those who have health-related reasons to need them - the old or infirm, for example. This would generate new jobs for the low-skilled people who now clean the homes of the affluent. And in a less gender-divided social order, husbands and boyfriends would more readily do their share of the chores. </p> <p>The moral challenge is, put simply, to make work visible again: not only the scrubbing and vacuuming but all the hoeing, hammering, drilling and lifting that goes into creating and maintaining a livable habitat. In an ever more economically unequal culture, where so many of the affluent devote their lives to such ghostly pursuits as stock trading, image making and opinion polling, real work - in the old-fashioned sense of labour that engages hand as well as eye, that tires the body and directly alters the physical world - tends to vanish from sight. </p> <p>The feminists of my generation tried to bring some of it into the light of day, but, like busy women fleeing the house in the morning, they left the project unfinished, the debate broken off in mid-sentence, the noble intentions unfulfilled. Sooner or later, someone else will have to finish the job.</p>",
  "Nowhere is western culture more baffling than in matters of body weight. From modern medicine, the caveats have come thick and fast. In 1997, the World Health Organisation declared a global epidemic of obesity. European health experts convened in May this year in Antwerp to call for action in order to prevent a 'lost generation' of children hooked on fast foods, television and computers from developing diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In July, the Medical Research Council cautioned MPs that unless efforts were made to cut obesity, the Government's targets to reduce these diseases wouldn't be met. <br> The codicils from this quarter don't help: the BMA announced in June that actresses and models during the late-1990s carried a scant 10 to 15 per cent body fat (the average for healthy women is 20 to 26 per cent), concluding that such exposure to 'unachievable' goals could spur eating disorders, and adding that 'more realistic body shapes need to be shown on TV and in fashion magazines'. Be slim to be healthy. Don't be too slim to be socially acceptable. And all you need to be slim is fat, sugar and calories. That was the message in that commercial for H\u00e4agen-Dazs in which a twentysomething man and woman made love on a sofa, mingling heaping spoonfuls of Pralines &amp; Cream with the wettest of French kisses. Sex. Youth. Beauty. Ice cream? The incongruity didn't end there. The lovers are skeletons, an unlikely couple to imagine opting for a tub at the check-out counter.   I was 10 years old when I learned I was overweight. We had recently moved to London, and my mother ordered some custom-made suits for me from a tailor in Hong Kong, who specialised in mail-order finery. She sent the measurements along and, when the clothes arrived, there was a greeting from the tailor. The faltering English did little to soften its thrust: 'These are suits for your fat son. We made them special fat so he can grow extra fatty in them.' There was mild horror laced with hearty laughter at the dinner table that night.   Suddenly - and perhaps too early for my benefit - the 'big' issue was upon me. I've had to contend with being overweight for most of my 40 years. On the health side, I've been fortunate. I've suffered none of the scourges associated with the morbidly obese, which (as defined by the medical profession is anyone 100lb over their ideal weight) I gather I am. My yearly check-ups are unremarkable. My weight hasn't been an obstacle to pleasures enjoyed by the ideally trim: women haven't turned me away; I've played a good standard of tennis for 30 years; though buying clothes can be a challenge, in the competition between dessert and dressing up the winner has never been in doubt.   I am the product of a family and culture that lives to eat. My grandfather, who turns 100 in October, claims the source of his extraordinarily good health has been his refusal to eat vegetables or drink water without whisky in it. He has never exercised. His diet has been rich in saturated fats and refined grains and sugars. Despite a slight paunch, his weight has revolved around 12st 7lb for most of his life. Which isn't to say that the body image and health themes haven't been present. In my family, diets were frequently embarked upon between bouts of comprehensive bingeing. On the distaff side, the relationship to food has been ambivalent: one instance of anorexia, another of bulimia and generous helpings of crash dieting and pill popping.   My sisters have unquestionably managed their weight more consistently than I have, whereas my love of food has been singular and unequivocal. My seven years as a restaurant critic in America didn't do me any favours. My wife frets over what my appetite for eating, cooking and obsessing about food does to our time together, which might otherwise be better spent on more beneficial pursuits: she has a point. She worries that there's a limit to how much good genes can help and cautions that I shouldn't ignore my long-term health prospects: she has a point there, too. Meanwhile, my weight had recently ballooned to 21st. An exercise in futility and deprivation - that has been my experience with diets.   The so-called 'hungry high' is an oxymoron. I've tried the Scarsdale Diet, the Rotation Diet, the Atkins Diet, the Pritikin Diet, the Cambridge Diet, even the Beverly Hills Diet - mother of all crazies, truly a child of its time. In 1981, a self-anointed 'nutrition guru' named Judy Mazel theorised that by applying the enzymes in fruit according to her plan, one could lose weight. On a diet of fruit, there was little alternative. Week One's menu consisted of pineapples and two bananas on Monday; papayas and mangoes on Tuesday; papayas, pineapples and more papayas on Wednesday; watermelons all day on Thursday and again on Sunday; two bananas, dried apricots and blueberries on Friday; and prunes, strawberries and two bananas on Saturday. I tried it three times. By the week's end, I was a fruitcake. I never made it to Week Two.   I was 13 when I underwent my first fat-farm experience. My parents had travelled to a hospital in Italy to try a method that was all the rage in the 1970s, and soon after I was enrolled with my older sister. We did it again as a family, with my grandfather in tow, and in protest. I went to Rome no fewer than three times. We were informed that through an injection of a hormone extracted from a pregnant woman's urine, we could lose 21lb in 21 days. The full details were less salubrious. The human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) hormone is secreted by women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Dr A Simeons published a report in 1954 in which he observed how so-called 'fat boys' with adiposogenital dystrophy (a syndrome of undescended testicles) were helped by daily injections of the hormone. For a time, the world watched and some, like us, followed. Simeons was a poor advertisement for his method. He had died of weight-related coronary disease some years prior to my first visit to his centre of operations, Rome's Ospedale Salvatori Mundii. The regime worked insofar as I did lose 21lb. The 500 calorie-per-day diet may have had just a little to do with it.   Perhaps it can never be too emphatically said how, of all cities, Rome should be the last one in which to starve. Misery was the order of each day. A pricking needle in my buttocks was my wake-up call. Breakfast consisted of weak tea or coffee with skimmed milk plus all the saccharine I desired. Lunch was 100gm of meat, chicken or fish - boiled to a pulp - with boiled green vegetables, a single bread stick and a single piece of fruit. Dinner was a repeat of lunch. Water was the only beverage. It was abstinence, Italian-style. A wise move on the hospital's part was to have nuns serve the food, for the urge to physically assault the person serving your food was powerful. I actually fainted on one occasion. The nun gave a glucose tablet and a benediction. There was a silver lining, and it came early: two days before starting, you were encouraged to 'force feed' in order to build up what was enigmatically referred to as 'fat reserve'.   The obvious arguments - one, that we were obese, not geese, and two, that surely there was already more than enough of the latter - were never offered. Instead, we repaired to the most aromatic trattorias in nearby Trastevere and took no prisoners at the table. I should note that hCG has since been completely discredited as a treatment for obesity. Whatever weight was lost was quickly regained, usually with interest. My next big diet-centre experience was in North Carolina's Duke University Medical Centre, which has since become Diet Central for the variety of weight treatments on offer. I sampled the so-called 'rice diet'. It was a fitting appellation: rice for breakfast, rice for lunch and rice for dinner, puffed or boiled, no extras, and above all, with no salt. Patients who attended the 'Rice House' were simply the heaviest people I had ever seen in my life. I felt like a ballet dancer standing next to a fleet of barrage balloons. Some of the very largest had to be lowered like grand pianos down recesses beside staircases in order to help them make it to the dining room. Many were on respirators and the sound of wheezing breezed through the house.   The scene at the swimming pool in neighbouring Duke Towers evoked a lagoon teeming with hippos. I mislaid some 45lb, but soon found them again. The Rice House is still open for business, even on the web: <a href=\"http://www.ricediet.com. The\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ricediet.com. </a>The realm of prescription medication has for the most part been terra incognita . In the 1970s, a well-known doctor in London gave me so-called 'fat-burning' and diuretic pills that had me sweating like an ox and feeling that a heart attack was around the corner. I haven't sampled the new generation. <br>  As for the new miracle pill, Orlistat, let the side-effect literature speak for itself: 'oily spotting, flatulence with discharge, faecal urgency, fatty or oily stool, oily evacuation, increases defecation and faecal incontinence'. 'We have a paradox,' says Dr Robert Lefever, director of the Promis Counselling Centre in London, where compulsions of every type are treated as variants of the same fundamental disorder: addiction. 'Diets don't work,' he says. 'But the only way to lose weight is to diet.' His views can seem contradictory. He sees addiction as a condition best treated by former addicts, not shrinks. He's critical of surgical treatments from the medical world to which he belongs. 'Surgeons have no place in dealing with a psychological problem. There's an awful lot of quackery, such as stomach stapling and gastric bypass.' He isn't kidding.   Hospitals offer a wide menu of grisly procedures designed to put an end to obesity - and much else besides. Two primary bariatric surgical procedures are commonly used: vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass. The genesis of this none-too-modest proposal for weight loss dates back to 1969, when it was noted that near total removal of the stomach for cancer and ulcers caused patients to remain at below their normal weight. The approach involves stapling off most of the stomach, bypassing the duodenum and allowing the undigested food to pass directly into the small intestine. The weight loss occurs as the body adjusts to its new, limited capacity to absorb nutrients, for which vitamin supplements are thereafter widely prescribed. The mortality risks are deemed 'relatively low', though there is a chance of forming adhesions in the bowel, which frequently calls for more surgery.   The aftereffects are a laundry list. My favourite is the 'dumping syndrome'. After surgery, all food is emptied from the stomach pouch into the small intestine. Sweets and fatty foods irritate the small intestine, causing symptoms such as abdominal cramping, sweating, and general malaise. Eating and drinking fluids simultaneously is another way to feel the dumping syndrome; they recommend waiting half an hour between eating and drinking - for the rest of your life. Can the surgery be reversed? Yes, but the risks are greater than those braved the first time. Hippocrates gave us the recipe for weight loss 24 centuries ago - eat less and exercise more - and while for most that still holds true, perhaps it's possible that there's an even better way.   France's Michel Montignac, in his book Eat Yourself Slim, proposes a diet that aims to satisfy the passionate eater and lacks the more usual element of self-denial present in every diet I've ever tried. Rather disarmingly, when I spoke to him recently he said, 'Forget about my book before embarking on a plan, and simply eat the French way, then read my book.' Montignac, formerly obese, now trim but still a foodie, advocates eating well, regardless of caloric intake. The way to avoid putting on weight, he claims, is by classifying foods by their glucose content, which causes the body to produce high amounts of insulin to combat it, resulting in obesity. Beer, potatoes, cooked carrots, soft drinks, and pastry are out. Beef, dark chocolate, red wine, foie gras, ice cream are in, along with healthier foods such as wholemeal grains and pasta, pulses, fruit, and green vegetables.   A typical Montignac day begins with either a lipid breakfast or a carbohydrate breakfast. The lipid is less healthy, but acceptable: fried eggs, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms. The carbohydrate breakfast offers all the wholegrain toast and sugar-free jam you want, plus cereal with skimmed milk. Fruit before any meal must be consumed on an empty stomach, waiting 15 minutes to digest.   Lunch or dinner can be either salad with goat's cheese and fillet of beef with B\u00e9arnaise sauce and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, then cheese for dessert, or brown rice with tomato coulis, salad with cottage cheese, and low-fat yogurt mixed with fructose jam. Dressings and sauces are fine, as long as they contain no sugar, honey or flour. Fats are to be avoided with carbohydrates, while refined starches and sugar in any form are banned. I haven't been stinting on any food group and have followed the plan to the letter. I have lost 1st 7lb. I've been travelling abroad with no regimen to keep me from restaurants or rich foods. It has all been dead simple. 'The way out is via the door,' said Confucius. 'Why is it that no one will use this method?' Now if I can only see it to the end.",
  "<p><strong> Not the News at Ten</strong><br> Victory at last for BBC journalists who resisted attempts by Tony 'Head Prefect' Hall to rebrand the Nine O'Clock News as the 'BBC News at Nine'. Greg Dyke is expected to use his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh this week to confirm that the programme will move to 10pm. </p> <p>But calling it BBC News at Ten is impossible. ITN owns the rights to the News at Ten name and has just revived the title on its new digital 24-hour news channel. So what will Dyke's new offering be called? Roll credits - and cheering in the gallery - for the Ten O'Clock News. Inspired and on its own worth the cost of the licence fee. </p> <p><strong> Aura of excess</strong><br> Anyone surprised by recent revelations surrounding Aura, the now defunct women's magazine run by ex-Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror editor Eve Pollard's Parkhill Publishing, clearly doesn't know La Bollard. While some people's jaws may have dropped at suggestions that Eve had a somewhat imperious approach to management, her larger-than-life style is legendary among hacks who've worked for the exemplary campaigner for Women in Journalism. One former Sunday Express city editor was once ordered to pick up a new video machine in La Bollard's chauffeur-driven car and install it at her London pad. </p> <p>Sensing a scoop, he was only too happy to oblige. The device was installed in record time, ready to receive what the poor hack thought would be a video of shady shenanigans in the Square Mile. Alas, secret film of City goings-on there was none. But like Eve's many fetchers of make-up and fresh apples, said city editor did prove himself in tune with the boss's whims. </p> <p> <strong> Deep Timidity Indicated</strong><br> Rumours continue to swirl that the Slickers, those very ex-Mirror tipsters, have been interviewed or arrested by the Old Bill during the Department of Trade and Industry's inquiry into share dealings at the tabloid. Not true. Nor is the DTI likely to see them before the autumn. Chief Slicker Boyhrul and his legal eagle are going on hols and sidekick James Hipwell is, sadly, waiting for a kidney transplant. Meanwhile, the DTI has taken soundings from not one, but three eminent law firms. One is said to be for a prosecution, one against and one undecided.

  "<p>John Vickers, the Oxford economist who will become head of the Office of Fair Trading in the autumn, has gained a reputation as a man of few words. </p> <p>As the Bank of England's chief economist he has, for the past two years, been a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. </p> <p>While other members of this highly influential body have spent time lecturing and speaking publicly about the thinking behind their decisions on interest rates and inflation, Vickers has kept his counsel. One observer says: 'He has become well known for having views which are not well known.' </p> <p>But while he has generally shunned the limelight as far as his MPC duties are concerned, Vickers's previous academic work gives some indications of what the OFT is likely to be under him. </p> <p>First, he will be a big contrast to the previous director-general of Fair Trading, John Bridgeman, who was a businessman. Vickers is a Fellow of All Souls Oxford (he achieved fellowship aged 21), and has held posts at Princeton, Harvard and the London Business School, as well as consulting and working for Shell. </p> <p>What people say about him reflects who they are. One leading competition lawyer said: 'I was rather surprised. What does an academic know about the day-to-day running of competition cases? There is nothing in his background which suggests he knows how to deal with companies, and across the wide range of markets.' </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the lawyer said he would have preferred the other front-running candidate - Philip Collins, another leading competition lawyer. </p> <p>On the other hand, academic economists feel that the Vickers appointment marks a significant change for the better in the Government's view of the OFT. </p> <p>Paul Klemperer, an influential competition expert, says: 'He is someone who understands and has thought deeply about competition issues for a long period of time. </p> <p>'This is important, especially as the economy has moved in a direction where these issues are becoming more complex and technical.' </p> <p>Another economist who knows Vickers well says: 'The level of economic literacy in the policy process in the UK is appallingly low. The same is true of the British judiciary, which is not economically literate. With Vickers's appointment, I am optimistic that economics will be at the heart of policymaking in future.' </p> <p>Business is not unhappy. Ruth Lea, of the Institute of Directors, says: 'It seems a natural fit for him. He is very well respected and I am sure that he will do a good job.' </p> <p>Consumers are content, too. Phil Evans, senior policy adviser to the Consumers' Association, says 'he will potentially make OFT investigations more robust', suggesting that Vickers will take a less business-orientated view than Bridgeman. </p> <p>But do we need economists to play this role? Look at the US, they say. The Federal Trade Commission is crammed with economists. The judiciary is too. Not only would the Microsoft judgment have been much less likely in the UK, the amount that business and economics learnt from it would have been far smaller. </p> <p>Second, Vickers made his name formulating an analytical framework around precisely the issues which face the OFT today. </p> <p>The value of his work was recognised when he was one of the 'wise men' appointed by Tony Blair to advise Labour on competition policy. Vickers has focused on privatisation, regulated industries, the extent to which competition can replace regulation as these industries mature, and the problems of developing policies which compensate for imperfections in markets caused by monopolies and dominant companies. </p> <p>The rules of supply matching demand through a straightforward pricing mechanism can become distorted where monopolistic or dominant companies operate, or in industries which are highly capital-intensive and have high fixed costs. </p> <p>The interests of companies which look to compete with dominant players as well as consumers can be threatened. For example, instead of simple market principles, the theory of second best - in which prices have to be taxed to level the playing field between companies with high fixed costs and those without - may take hold. </p> <p>In a 1997 paper, Vickers examines one aspect of this, known as Ramsey pricing, which is concerned with finding the best possible price for consumers, subject to a firm not going out of business. It may all seem very dry. But as Klemperer says: 'While he has done important work in theoretical economics, it has always been very much with an eye to practical applications.' </p> <p>This is the rub. </p> <p>The OFT which Bridgeman leaves is different to the one that he joined. Vickers's role will be to make the new OFT work. The Competition Act gives the OFT strong powers, first to bust cartels and second to prevent the abuse of market power by dominant firms - an agenda which could create greater tensions between the organisation and business. </p> <p>The second of these is more controversial, certainly with business, than the first. Although lawyers have for years applied EU legislation in this area, the Act gives the OFT a role for the first time </p> <p>Vickers will need to ensure the OFT pursues its high-profile role effectively and does not come a cropper, as it did in controversial cases such as the pricing of Rupert Murdoch's Times newspaper. </p> <p>In addition, there is a great deal of work in progress, not only on mergers and cartels but investigations into areas where market dominance plays a part, such as motorway service stations, computer retailing agreements, the conduct of the professions, and the 'beer orders'. One colleague and friend says: 'His grounding in industrial organisation will be invaluable. A lot of the issues in regulating BT, for example, which he has looked at carefully, are about when you have a dominant provider but a fringe of competitive providers. How do you regulate access to the network and to the market? That is not far away from regulating market dominance.' </p> <p>One area, however, remains less clear. Although the third significant change in policy is the removal of ministerial involvement in merger decisions, it is unlikely that the DGFT will become an apolitical job. </p> <p>Bridgeman was denied a second term as DGFT, something he is said to have wanted badly, because of politically generated problems. He is said to have fallen out with Ministers - officials insist it was not Byers, but Consumer Affairs Minister Kim Howells - because he was reticent about the Government's 'rip-off Britain' campaign. </p> <p>In particular, he saw no merit in investigating the prices of soft drinks charged in pubs after Howells had demanded they be examined. </p> <p>He was also seen as less than enthusiastic about other elements of the campaign - for example, an investigation into supermarket pricing. Vickers's academic expertise on pricing issues will be applicable to 'market dominance' among retailers as it was in his work on BT. But whether he will be any better than Bridgeman at producing a politically digestible result is unclear. His 'Trappist' tendencies suggest he is not keen on playing in the political limelight. </p> <p>Some officials in the DTI are pleased with the Vickers appointment, which was said to have the stamp of the Treasury on it. But Evans at the Consumers' Association says Bridgeman was badly treated by his political masters, who looked for policies which had the populist touch, and which the CA on the face of it would endorse, but which were difficult to implement. They cannot expect Vickers to lend authority to policies which don't stand up. </p> <p>'The OFT has had a lot of investigations dumped on it which it has not got the power to carry out. Bridgeman was shabbily treated. I am sure Vickers will not be pushed around by Ministers. He will just have too much professional integrity.' </p> <p>On the other hand, Vickers's presence may mean that policies which are not intellectually robust will not see the light of day in the first place. Ministers could only thank him for that. </p> <p><strong> Profile </strong></p> <p><strong>Subject: </strong> John Vickers </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> 7 July 1959 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Director-general of Fair Trading designate </p> <p><strong> Interesting fact: </strong> Vickers is Lord Mallard, an important and honorary position at All Souls dating back to the 15th century.

  "<p>Just what is De Beers up to? The South African diamond giant has for the past hundred years or so endured a reputation similar to Big Brother's Nick Bateman, thanks to the way it has ruthlessly dominated its industry, shoring up its position by mopping up surplus diamonds to help keep gem prices high. </p> <p>Despite being banned from the US on anti-trust grounds, De Beers' control of the diamond market has hitherto seemed unassailable. But recently it seems to have had something of an epiphany. A little over 18 months ago De Beers was sitting on around $5 billion worth of diamonds. Now its stockpile has been reduced by more than half. As a result, the firm last week unveiled record half-year sales figures of more than $3.5 billion, triple the figure for the same period last year. </p> <p>And what is more, the company has pledged to clamp down on 'conflict diamonds' - those extracted in war zones and sold to raise money that fuels the fighting. By next year, De Beers insists, none of its diamond partners will be trading in conflict gems. </p> <p>Admirable. But of course, in the meantime, De Beers will continue to use its stockpile, pumping into the market gems extracted from who knows where on the Dark Continent. The company bridles when asked whether the gems now going on sale came from conflict zones. In legal terms, they will have been mined before a recently agreed definition of conflict gems by human rights groups, governments and the likes of De Beers. </p> <p>The more important point in the longer term is how the big diamond firms can guarantee that their wares are not from conflict zones. This means independent auditing. All the mining firms agree that this is a good idea - after all, consumers are increasingly concerned about where their rocks are coming from, and this could threaten sales. </p> <p>But building an efficient, globally endorsed verification system is a huge challenge. De Beers created its own internal auditing system a few years ago but this lacks credibility, according to human rights groups which know how it works. </p> <p>The firm's managing director, Gary Ralfe, may last week have been talking up his company's prospects, but ultimately he knows that bridging this credibility gap is the diamond industry's biggest challenge. If it fails to do this, consumers will seek other ways of telling their partners that they love them. Diamonds are not necessarily forever. </p> <p>\u0095 Two cheers for Jim Rose, one of the few UK dotcom bosses who seems to appreciate that, dammit, a merging of internet firms should, just like marriage, be entered into soberly and responsibly. While the wreckage that now constitutes the dotcom sector has prompted many firms to enter into hasty and perhaps ill-starred unions, <a href=\"http://www.qxl.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">QXL's</a> chief executive had the audacity to question the sense of merging the auction firm with Germany's Ricardo at any price. </p> <p>As the negotiations progressed, it emerged that QXL's potential partner was not all it was cracked up to be. Question marks hung over its sales figures. Rose, in the interests of QXL's shareholders, balked at the deal and forced Ricardo's investors to accept 38 per cent of the newly combined company, rather than the 43 per cent the original deal would have brought them. </p> <p>Given the way internet paper has been sprinkled around like confetti over the past couple of years, Rose's decision was a welcome reality check. </p> <p>However, while question marks hung over the deal, both sides saw the value of their paper slide dramatically. When the deal was announced, Ricardo was worth nearly \u00a3630 million. The new deal values it at \u00a3170m. </p> <p>Given the greatly diminished value of the new company, the real winner from the deal could end up being arch US rival eBay, which many analysts argue is the only play in town. </p> <p>Rose accepts that Europe has room for only one online auctioneer. Ensuring it is QXL will earn him a full quota of cheers in the City.</p>",
  "Campaigners against Aids in South Africa will start legal proceedings this week to force the government to save thousands of babies from painful and lingering deaths. <p>It emerged last week that for four months the government of President Thabo Mbeki has been sitting on a European Union-sponsored report suggesting that giving retro-viral drugs to pregnant women could save the lives of nearly 14,000 babies. </p> <p>It is estimated that such a programme, involving the use of Nevirapine anti-viral drugs, would cost the country the equivalent of about 20p per head of population - less than \u00a3700 for each life saved. The report says overall savings for the public purse could even result from such a programme, because the new-born babies would not require treatment for HIV or Aids. </p> <p>In the absence of any coherent explanation for the government's refusal to extend anti-viral treatment to expectant mothers who are HIV positive, Mbeki is being accused of having taken a decision to kill the babies by way of an act of omission rather than to burden the country with orphans. </p> <p>The failure to act against mother-to-child infections is only one facet of the South African government's baffling approach to the epidemic - which includes a continued refusal by Mbeki to extend anti-viral treatment to rape victims, as well as his government's failure to provide such treatment for the infected general population. </p> <p>It is becoming apparent that the explanation for these seemingly perverse policies lies in South Africa's state of denial over Aids. </p> <p>The official refusal to face the facts of the epidemic, at least as a first-hand experience, is chilling in its pervasiveness. While Aids is openly recognised and debated in the media - and undertakers are enjoying their biggest boom since the slaughter during the township uprisings of the mid-Eighties - any mention of the killer disease is taboo, where individual deaths are concerned. </p> <p>Legislation introduced prohibiting mandatory testing of workers by employers - designed to prevent victimisation - has fuelled myths among even trained medical personnel that it is a criminal offence to confirm anyone is dying of, or has died of, Aids. </p> <p>Ironically, the effect is often to lift responsibility from the employer. The Observer has obtained a copy of a circular issued by the Chamber of Mines to mining houses offering an interpretation of the law - which some lawyers would regard as tendentious - prohibiting employers from HIV testing, even if it is requested by an employee. </p> <p>The result of such advice is that mine doctors stand by helplessly while men whom they know are probably dying are sent to work in extreme underground conditions. </p> <p>There are courageous individuals who break the silence. In Soweto recently, a mother interrupted the funeral service of her son, said to have died of pneumonia, to announce that his killer was, in fact, Aids. She then distributed free condoms among the mourners in the church. </p> <p>But such openness can be dangerous, as was famously discovered by a young woman in KwaZulu-Natal province who announced that she was HIV positive and was promptly stoned to death by neighbours. </p> <p>Nelson Mandela's one-time aide, Walter Sisulu, also 'came out' with an announcement recently that one of his grandchildren had died of Aids. Another instance of going public was the case of Charlene Smith, a rape victim who identifed herself and told her story in The Observer last year in an attempt to help fellow rape victims avoid the trauma she had suffered in the attack itself, and the subsequent battle to get anti-viral treatment. </p> <p>Smith was denounced as 'racist' by Mbeki, on the ground that she was propagating the myth that all black men were rapists. </p> <p>The presidential outburst was possibly a significant pointer where explanations for the denial are concerned. One of the most compelling analyses of the syndrome was offered here last week by Dr Suzanne Leclerc-Madlala, a medical anthropologist at the University of Natal. </p> <p>In a lengthy and sensitive article on the subject, published by Johannesburg's Mail &amp; Guardian, she wrote: 'For a variety of reasons, all strongly rooted in the continent's unique political, economic, social and racial history, there are layers of denial and silence that preclude a serious grappling with sexual cultures. There are widespread beliefs that males are biologically programmed to need sexual relations regularly with more than one woman and often concurrently. Such beliefs are logically consistent with societies that were traditionally polygamous. Research has found that these beliefs are held almost as strongly by women as by men.' </p> <p>She said: 'There is a significant body of well-researched and well-documented social science studies that points to high levels of premarital sexual activity, extramarital relations and sexual violence, making African societies more at risk for HIV/Aids than those in other parts of the world. </p> <p>'In many communities, women can expect a beating, not only if they suggest condom usage, but also if they refuse sex, if they curtail a relationship, if they are found or suspected to have another partner, or or even if they are believed to be thinking about someone else.' </p> <p>If such analysis holds true, the situation would appear to call for strong national leadership to deal with the denial. Tragically, in Mbeki the country seems to have precisely the opposite - a man who is not only in denial himself, but preaches his own version of reality with potentially dire consequences. </p> <p>A Sussex University economics graduate, seen during the years of struggle against apartheid as the African National Congress's arch-diplomat, Mbeki was widely regarded as sophisticated and cosmopolitan. Time and experience now offer, however, another perspective - of a man whose sensitivity on race points to a previously undiscovered psychological trauma which, while deserving of sympathy, makes him among the politicians least qualified to heal past wounds. </p> <p>Nursing the dreams of an Mbeki-led African 'renaissance', in the cauldron of which he sees the rebirth of black pride, he seems driven to deny the reality of Aids. He has done so by the pursuit of 'African' cures such as Virodine, a drug containing an industrial solvent, which is considered by safety experts to be toxic. </p> <p>The President has tried to force an alternative explanation as to the pathology of the disease on a scornful and appalled medical world. He is allowing his people to die painful, lonely, and at times unnecessary deaths. </p> <p>Nero fiddled while Rome burned. And while Mbeki spreads his fanciful opinions about Aids, South Africa sickens and dies.</p>",
  "<p> In Quiz Show, the high-minded university teacher Mark Van Doren, played by Paul Scofield, dismisses cheating on a TV quiz show by saying that 'it's like plagiarising a comic strip'. The line is presumably intended to show how simple and naive people were back in the 1950s. </p> <p>For as every child of our time knows, what could be more damnable, and actionable, than plagiarising a comic strip? Comic-strip authors are now cult figures like the superheroes they create, and Jack Lee, only begetter of Spiderman and the Hulk, was one of the chief speakers last week at a rally honouring President Clinton. </p> <p>Bryan Singer's hi-tech SF fantasy, <strong> X-Men</strong> , is inspired by the legendary comic-book characters Jack Lee came up with in 1963 who, at the time, were a liberal challenge to various kinds of racial, social and political prejudices of the day. Lee proposed the existence in our midst of a species of mutants with super powers who are perceived by ordinary humans as a threat to society. </p> <p>These mutants are divided into two rival camps that corresponded in the 1960s to the followers of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. The calm, benevolent Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) attempts to shape his mutants to use their gifts on behalf of mankind and to work for assimilation or at least peaceful co-existence. </p> <p>His deadly enemy and former friend, the hot-headed Magneto (Ian McKellen), fed up with compromise, is in favour of a pre-emptive strike against a hostile, inferior human race. He kidnaps a McCarthy-like US senator (Bruce Davison), who seeks to register and sequester mutants, and plans to wipe out a summit conference of world leaders convened to consider the mutant problem. </p> <p>Like Tim Burton's two Batman films, The X-Men is a dark work with an emphasis on pain and suffering that is more masochistic than sadistic. Magneto and the wheelchair-borne Xavier go through self-inflicted agony in the pursuit of their causes and there are constant mutilations and woundings. The special effects are impressive, and ironic use is made of Ellis Island (setting for the world summit) and the Statue of Liberty (where Magneto establishes his headquarters). </p> <p>But while Stewart and McKellen lend gravitas to the proceedings, The X-Men lacks the humour that made the similar, but more ambiguous, Men in Black such a delight. </p> <p>Tolstoy was probably right in saying that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. But in the movies, dysfunctional families the world over act much like each other. Which is to say when gathered for weddings, birthdays and funerals they fight, go in for figurative and literal blood-letting, drag skeletons from cupboards, get maudlin drunk and try to put tiny plasters on the old wounds they've opened up. </p> <p>Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's <strong> Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train</strong> is a superior example of the horrific family reunion picture, in this case for the funeral of the 70-year-old minor painter, Jean-Baptiste Emmerich (a silent Jean-Louis Trintignant), who insists that his body be taken from Paris and buried in the world's largest cemetery in his native Limoges. </p> <p>The film's first act takes place on the train where the friends, relatives and hangers-on of the exploitative, bi-sexual artist bicker and backbite as they recall their association with the deceased. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the body is being transported south in the back of a car driven by an Algerian male nurse who had been his lover. 'Is it legal to carry a coffin in a private vehicle?' someone asks. </p> <p>At Limoges, the painter's long-estranged twin brother (a more vocal Trintignant) is there to put everyone at ill-ease, and in the absence of a priest at the graveside, an elderly intellectual reads a poem by Stevie Smith and the dead man's embittered nephew (Charles Berling) makes a speech about how much they'd all been hated by the man they've gathered to bury. </p> <p>More of the same ensues in Act Three, the wake in the family mansion, and because it's so wild, the effect is exhilarating rather than depressing. The actors confidently inhabit their characters and the picture looks good and has a stunning final helicopter shot of Limoges and the necropolis from the air, accompanied by the adagio from Mahler's Tenth Symphony. Generally, however, there's far too much music on a soundtrack that includes songs by Charles Aznavour, Bj\u00f6rk, James Brown, Nina Simone and the Doors. </p> <p><strong> Me Myself I</strong> is a lightweight Australian comedy in the style of Peggy Sue Got Married and Closing Doors , starring Rachel Griffiths as a single career woman in her thirties. </p> <p>While pondering her fate, Griffiths suddenly meets in some kind of parallel universe the version of her younger self who married her university sweetheart and settled down as housewife and mother. </p> <p>The doppelg\u00e4nger leaves her to cope with this new world in a Sydney suburb and the jokes are none too funny, especially those about potty training, helping a 10-year-old to fit her first tampon, and learning how to insert a diaphragm when you've become used to using condoms. </p> <p>The charming Griffiths, who's like a restless Australian version of Juliette Binoche, almost makes it bearable. </p> <p><strong> Himalaya</strong> , the first feature film by Eric Valli, a French documentarist resident in Nepal, is a slow, ravishingly beautiful picture. A sort of Asian western, it's about the rivalry during a long, arduous journey over the Nepalese mountains between a village elder and a young drover with aspirations to become chieftain of the community. </p> <p>This is in effect Red River with yaks instead of steers and there's even a sensible woman to mediate between the men, the role Joanne Dru has in reconciling John Wayne and Montgomery Clift in Hawks's film. </p> <p>The heroes of Robert Jan Westdijk's <strong> Siberia</strong> , a flashy Dutch comedy, are two nasty young layabouts who exploit foreign female backpackers in Amsterdam, sleeping with them, stealing their money and ripping the identity page from their passports to keep as souvenirs. Neither gets his just deserts though a Russian girl rumbles their scheme. </p> <p>I left this nasty picture reflecting that as students of law and medicine study legal and medical ethics, similar courses should be made obligatory in film schools. </p> <p><strong> Ring</strong> , one of the most popular Japanese pictures of recent years, is a mildly intriguing horror picture in which a Tokyo TV reporter investigates an urban legend about a strange video cassette that leads anyone seeing it to die within a week. </p> <p>The story turns out to be true, and risking their lives, she and her ex-husband follow clues that lead to an offshore island and a witch's curse. Ring brings to mind the first hour of Lost Highway but lacks the haunting power of David Lynch's film.</p>",
  "<p><strong> No 2 </strong> Assembly Rooms <br><strong> Barbaric Comedies</strong> Kings Theatre <br><strong> Don Juan</strong> Royal Lyceum Theatre <br><strong> Picasso's Women</strong> Assembly Rooms </p> <p>The festival is in disarray. Stretched between official and Fringe events, it lasts too long and it's too bad. And its points of reference are topsy-turvy. Where do you expect the crispest writing and accomplished direction? The Traverse. So in what sense is the Traverse part of the Fringe? Why should the official festival, with its big-name directors, its makeover merchants, be called 'international' when it's more often a modestly funded Fringe performance that wires you directly into another culture's psyche? </p> <p>As does Toa Fraser's gentle Fiji romance,<strong> No 2</strong> . This South Seas bubble draws on the background of its 25-year-old dramatist and its 20-year-old actor: Fraser's family left Fiji for New Zealand in the Fifties; the magically self-transforming Madeleine Sami is part Fijian Indian. A gradually unwinding story of family quarrels and closeness is told through dreams and legends, sharp gossip and hip-hop. </p> <p>In an Auckland house, the number two of the title, a crotchety old Fijian matriarch, drinker of homemade grog, puffer of cigars, lover of fighting and music, of Jill Dando and Jamie Oliver, dreams of long-lost ancestral customs - and of deciding which of her grandchildren will succeed her as head of the clan. </p> <p>Sami plays all the contenders. She's the crosspatch, sentimental old woman, with clipped vowels and crooked arms. She's the precocious infant with a big chin and a comprehensive knowledge of island legend. She's a lovesick rugby player - her voice shifting into a husky male register - and his randy, athletically break-dancing cousin. She's a self-obsessed model called Hibiscus, and an eerie English girl. She's a marvel who could only happen on the Fringe. </p> <p>The International Festival got off to a dreadful start with the Abbey Theatre Dublin's production of <strong> Barbaric Comedies</strong> . The Galician dramatist Ram\u00f3n Maria del Valle-Incl\u00e1n has been credited as an influence on Almod\u00f3var, Lorca and Bu\u00f1uel; he has been lauded for employing a ground-breaking, anti-naturalistic cinematic technique, and celebrated as a self-destructive dandy. All this may be true, but on the evidence of Frank McGuinness's new version of the dramatist's trilogy, it's hard to see why anyone would love his plays for themselves. </p> <p>Under Calixto Bieito's direction, Barbaric Comedies is a mess. On to a murkily lit stage surge grateful peasants, corrupt cardinals, unsullied damsels, wild-eyed whores and bloodthirsty brothers. Everyone seems to have come out of the stock cupboard of Spanish drama. A randy old goat of a father provides one of the mainstays of the plot, with his unconvincing progress from lech to penitent. Its most lucid moments are its most lurid: varied violent rapes, and masturbation over the boiled-up corpse of a woman. Hardly a minute of the four and a half hours seems to pass without someone yelling, wailing, falling to the ground or waving their legs in the air. </p> <p>Mats Ek's production of Moli\u00e8re's <strong> Don Juan</strong> - brought from the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Stockholm, and performed in Swedish - is more composed. So composed that, with all its wheezes, it gives off an air of being constructed, made up. Which is not entirely appropriate as a way of treating a hero who gets carried away. A director is strutting his stuff. </p> <p>Ek's major innovation - apart from turning every sexual innuendo into a sexual act - is to introduce dance sequences throughout the play. Squirmy-legged or smooching, these intervals are often amusing, but it's not clear what prompts them. Are they underlining or undermining what is being said? Why does such movement not seep into the rest of the play? </p> <p>There's more flash than illumination. But there are moments of great flair. About to be given the nod by the statue of the Commendatore, Don Juan and his valet advance towards the audience, only to find themselves cut off - and forever - from the world they've inhabited as the safety curtain comes down behind them. Just before going to hell, the dirty Don slumps in a scarlet chair, with the orange glow from a television flickering over his face like infernal flames. And Mikael Persbrandt is compelling in the title role: a fleshy, dead-eyed voluptuary who puts on a really bad black wig to go wooing. </p> <p>This year is proving to be something of a philanderfest. At the Assembly Rooms, four one-person plays are devoted to the cross reflections of women who have been soured by living with a 'penis who paints'. </p> <p><strong> Picasso's Women</strong> sets out to tell the stories of some of the artist's companions, to give them back the voices they always thought they had. But despite the considerable and sometimes glittering efforts of the four actresses, Brian McAvera's plays succeed only in presenting a series of dull stereotypes. </p> <p>There's Dora Maar, played unweepingly and too reverentially by Toyah Wilcox: the mad (but not really) one. There's Olga, the Russian aristocrat of the 'darlink' variety who obliges Geraldine Fitzgerald to produce a quantity of soulful, gurgling vowels. More fruitfully, Amanda Harris - as Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, the fierce one who got away - steamrollers over the banalities of her script with her great swooping voice and powerful, pent-up movements, and suggests someone who might have sculpted her own life and works. And Susannah York is so fluid and beguiling that she takes the sting out of the boringly reductive view of Jacqueline Roque as the minx who plotted to get the genius. </p> <p>Still, it's a good idea and talent wasted. The women are diminished by the language they use. Their excitement at their lover is sometimes banal - Pablo provides 'the aphrodisiac of power' - and sometimes craven: 'after Picasso - God'. Their sexual descriptions are Mills &amp; Boon: female mounds and tent-peg nipples. And never is there a glimmer of what might be the other point: how each woman entered the paintings.</p>",
  "<p> <strong> Bloodhound Gang</strong> <br>London Astoria</p> <p> At times it feels like you've wandered on to the set of a Farrelly brothers movie: two men are projectile-vomiting over each other's trousers; a fat boy is munching his way through a huge bag of doner kebabs; a girl is simulating fellatio with a musclebound man; another girl is pulling her hot pants up to reveal her buttocks; there are tasteless jokes about disabled people. Oh, and there are some songs as well. </p> <p>The Bloodhound Gang are determinedly not 'all about the music'. Despite having four albums to their name - Dingleberry Haze , Use Your Fingers , One Fierce Beer Coaster and Hooray for Boobies - this American five-piece only really have one song. But what a song. 'The Bad Touch' is one of the biggest-selling singles of the year; you will probably know it by its fantastically catchy chorus - 'You and me baby, we ain't nothing but mammals/ So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel' - and the video in which the band dress as monkeys and beat a gay French couple with baguettes. 'It's not homophobic,' they claimed when an airplay ban was threatened, 'it's anti-French.' </p> <p>As you may have gathered, the Bloodhound Gang are not exactly tortured souls. Of the current wave of US guitar bands beginning to break big over here - Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Deftones, Korn - the Bloodhounds are the jokers in the pack; almost unknown in their homeland, but loved by Britain's obnoxious teen population due to their radio-friendly outrageousness and GSOH. As lead rapper Jimmy Pop says, just after he's initiated a bodysurfing 'swim race' between two audience members, 'It's a lot more fun than a Travis concert, isn't it?' </p> <p>Part of the reason the Bloodhound Gang are big here and not in the States is that they are, at heart, anti-American anglophiles. Their favourite bands are Depeche Mode and The Smiths; the bass player wears Union Jack boxer shorts (as we discover when he wedges a pair of abandoned panties down them prior to a good sniff); they even crack jokes about Joey Deacon, for God's sake. And their frat-boy celebration of the grosser aspects of American culture is so over the top - they habitually offer a $100 bill to anyone who can consume vast quantities of soft drink or fast food, the intention being to make them vomit on stage - that it almost looks like satire. </p> <p>Which is not why 3,000 people are crammed into the humid Astoria on Wednesday night. They're here because Bloodhound Gang, like the Beastie Boys and King Kurt before them, are enormous, delinquent fun. The music, though generally devoid of tunes, is rap-rock by numbers, perfect for a good shoutalong with your mates. They're a student party that's just spun out of control, a kids' breakfast TV programme with added pornography, a punk karaoke session, a puke-covered pantomime. Even the aftershow party, sponsored by Ann Summers and featuring cocktail waitresses in bondage gear, is a good laugh, which is definitely not normal. </p> <p>And, in fact, they don't just have one song - because their new single, 'The Ballad of Chasey Lain', is pretty good too. It's not really a ballad, of course. That would be, like, sad. It's actually a love letter/chat-up line addressed to a famous porn actress: the first line of the chorus is 'You've had a lot of dick...' What a bunch of sweethearts they are.</p>",
  "<p>Delphine looked like a doll. She had a bob of black hair, shining eyes and a rosebud mouth that seemed painted onto her face. Her clothes were perfection. I remember the smocked dress she wore when I first saw her: cherries against a white background. When I first came to be Delphine's au pair, I had never been in charge of a child before but had a broad experience of looking after dolls. I thought this exquisite five-year-old Parisienne would be as charming as she looked - she would be a kind of doll. </p> <p>Her younger sister, Audrey, was a shambolic, demonstrative, vulnerable creature with blurry features. She retained a recently born look through her first two years of life and was still in nappies. I liked everything about her, although I was a little nervous about the technical challenge the nappies might present, having never changed one in my life. </p> <p>The sisters lived in a third-floor flat in the sixteenth arrondissement of Paris. It was my job to scrub floors, Hoover, iron, cook and look after them. Mme de Saintville was awesomely elegant. It was a look that, at 18, I admired despairingly. She made me feel doomed: lumpenly, irredeemably English. But, I was soon to discover, there was nothing about her mothering that I would ever wish to emulate. </p> <p>I was not aware that I had any ideas about children until I became an au pair. The first thing I learnt is that children change your life forever. Children take away your freedom. You can't even leave the house when you want to, you can't think your own thoughts. I was in genteel slavery. Delphine was in turmoil beneath her pretty frocks. She was a spoilt, neglected child - a torturer (and victim). But there was a nice child in there somewhere too. </p> <p>I felt sorry for Delphine, she had had a string of au pairs - and I only planned to stay for three months. I realised how cavalier and selfish this was. But shouldn't the parents have hired someone who could stay longer? Why weren't they worried about the string of broken attachments? </p> <p>Delphine was jealous of Audrey. She used to bite her in the bath. Her parents described her as spiteful. Sibling jealousy? They either had not heard of it or were not interested. And when they left me in charge of the children for a long weekend and came back to find that Audrey was more clingy to me than usual and had a stomach upset, they blamed everything on her illness, unable to see that it was their absence that had rocked her little boat. </p> <p>Mme de Saintville lived according to two laws: one for adults, one for children (and au pairs). Every night, the children had to eat macaroni without sauce. They didn't like it - and I didn't blame them. I regularly used to bury it in the bin. Sometimes I would glimpse Mme gliding out to one of her bridge parties carrying one of her heavenly strawberry tarts to offer her friends. </p> <p>I was learning what a difficult thing it is to look after children, especially when they are not your own; to have responsibility without authority. I was learning too that children feel with a passion that is total: they swerve between love and hate in a way that is exhausting for slower, more emotionally desiccated adults. </p> <p>I decided not to have any children of my own - or at least not for a very, very long time. And when I got back England, the first thing I did was to send my favourite dolls to Delphine and Audrey.</p>",
  "<p>When companies launched their 're-engineering' and 'downsizing' revolutions in the early Nineties, they triggered a chain of reactions that went out of their control. Ever since, they have been chasing their own game. </p> <p>Their first reaction was puzzlement that the newly stripped-down, turbo-charged corporate chassis wasn't actually moving any faster than the supposedly outdated Eighties model. Managers soon learned that the cynicism and resentment of those employees who had survived the remodelling was a greater drag on manoeuvrability than all the surplus weight they had thrown overboard. </p> <p>To overcome survivors' fear and loathing, employers then invented the idea of 'employability'. The message was: 'We can't promise you a long-term job, but in return for commitment today we'll give you the skills to be employable elsewhere when we let you go.' </p> <p>As surveys show, employability never surmounted a huge credibility gap. Attractive in theory, it is difficult to put into practice even for companies that mean it; and it is all too easy to fake. In consequence it held little value as a bargaining card. </p> <p>While companies were struggling to tame their new creation, employees were quickly mutating into something much less tractable. 'Hearts hardened by the decline of corporate job pro tection, these workers are demanding, mobile and self-reliant,' writes John Knell in Most Wanted: the Quiet Birth of the Free Worker , a new report from the Industrial Society. 'They are high on human capital and low on loyalty ... Capitalism has sired a new child, on the rise, on the make and on their own.' </p> <p>The arrival of the 'knowledge' worker as free agent has been predicted for some time - the 'e-lance economy', the decline of the job and Alec Reed's notion of a post-capitalist 'people-ism' are all different takes on the same thing. But Most Wanted shows not only a clearer outline of the phenomenon itself, but also, more intriguingly, some of the consequences. </p> <p>Currently Knell's 'free workers' are only a minority of the workforce, albeit a growing one - up to 25 million in the US, nearly as many as the blue-collar total. But if they want to (and experience suggests they will) many more could soon join the ranks of the free, thanks to a potent combination of demographics, the knowledge economy and the spread of electronic networks. </p> <p>Thus, up to 80 per cent of the value of large US companies now resides in intangible rather than physical assets - people and their ideas. And these new-economy assets are scarce. Europe will be short of 500,000 IT-literate employees in the next few years. The US lacks an esti mated 250,000 consultants (a truly remarkable thought). </p> <p>For many companies, competition for talent has taken over from competition for customers. As Knell puts it, in a world where companies need elite workers more than the reverse - and they know it - the jobs they craft are now their most important product. </p> <p>At the same time, the institutions underpinning the new relationships - networks, brokerages, spot markets for project work and a raft of other support intermediaries - are springing up all over the internet. This marks 'the beginning of a profound cultural shift in the way in which employer and contractor seek to attract and connect with each other'. </p> <p>The implications for companies are daunting. How do they win commitment without loyalty from employees who know they hold most of the aces? Today's ever-lengthening menus of benefit options, and the near-desperate obeisance to work-life issues, are just a foretaste of the mass-customisation of work that companies will have to carry out to attract and retain the new opportunists. </p> <p>Yet if companies are behind the curve, where does that leave other parts of the economy - the public sector, for example? </p> <p>If the free-worker scenario is correct, a huge crisis is brewing not only in the policy centres of Whitehall, but also in local government, health and, especially, education, the lifeblood of a knowledge-based economy. </p> <p>Think about it. In their search for higher performance, successive governments have systematically turned the screw on public-sector work with a centralised, numbers-driven management system that would have delighted the first Henry Ford. </p> <p>The effect of this on the knowledge-producing part of the public sector is not hard to imagine. Schools and universities provide not only the manpower but much of the raw knowledge that fuels the knowledge economy. They therefore urgently need the best of the new talent. </p> <p>As in football, the education employment system is already being put under intense strain by overcompetition for the services of existing star academics and teachers (free workers, in other words) and by underinvestment in new talent. </p> <p>Over time, repelled by treadmill conditions that might have been designed to stifle enterprise and creativity, the new blood will simply dry up. 'Free workers,' warns Knell, 'do not make good martyrs.' </p> <p>Equipping public service to compete in the market for new talent will be a mighty challenge for public policy - particularly for administrators with command-and-control attitudes. </p> <p>An even greater one will be grappling with the inequalities of the emerging labour market, which will not be solved simply by wiring the whole population. On the contrary, universal provision will widen the gulf between those able to use the available possibilities and those who cannot. </p> <p>In the long term, even if the number of winners increases, such disparities will become unsustainable at national level - let alone across a planet in which 4 billion out of a total population of 6 billion live in grinding poverty with no way of climbing onto the ladder. </p> <p>Who knows what will happen then? </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Britain's 25 million workers have received a substantial boost in the last few years as a raft of employment law reforms set a minimum wage, protected part-timers, helped the disabled and introduced many other valuable benefits. </p> <p>But, for many workers, the changes are theoretical and have not improved their lives. Perhaps the worst aspect of the employment infrastructure is a lack of enforcement by the Government and a refusal by businesses to observe the new regulations. </p> <p>The problem is 'huge', says the Low Pay Unit, which sends floods of unhappy workers to get help from citizens advice bureaux. </p> <p>Employment law is getting so complex that many employees do not appreciate their own rights. Today, for instance, could be a red letter day for some women, even though few probably realise it. In a change to our notoriously complicated maternity rules, many women whose babies were expected to be born from today will get a more generous entitlement to maternity pay and leave. A new mother can now receive 18 weeks' pay and leave even if she has worked for her employer for less than two years. Until now, those with shorter service were only entitled to 14 weeks. </p> <p>The maternity allowance - a weekly payment for mothers earning between \u00a330 and \u00a366 a week - also becomes more generous. But claimants have to have pay slips going back for more than a year to calculate the amount due to them, and many employers break the law by not issuing any. </p> <p>One of the easiest issues to deal with is the minimum wage - \u00a33.60 an hour for workers aged over 21, and \u00a33.20 for those aged between 18 and 21. The Inland Revenue polices this legislation through a compliance department. If an employer is paying too little, workers can ring a hotline number (0845 6000 678) and demand an investigation. </p> <p>The Revenue has put right many wrongs in this way, but it takes a narrow view of its job. If the employer has committed a breach of contract - say by reducing an employee's hours to meet the hourly rate threshold - the Revenue will not investigate the issue since, superficially, the law is being obeyed. </p> <p>But having compliance officers is very rare for any legislation. In most areas, the only help given with enforcement by the Government is the chance to claim at an employment tribunal. Jeff Masters of the Low Pay Unit says this is only a last resort: 'Informal ways of enforcing your rights are always the best ways. The employment relationship is still a relationship. Going to an employment tribunal can be like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.' </p> <p>The advice bureaux tend to agree. 'Employers can turn nasty and dismiss you,' says one adviser. 'So if you win in an employment tribunal, it could be a Pyrrhic victory. And in most cases - perhaps seven out of 10 - a worker will be looking for a reference, which is going to be harder to get in these circumstances. And the next employer might not look favourably on someone who took their last employer to a tribunal.' </p> <p>Many employees who are getting short-changed have little ability to fight back, according to Anna Barlow of the Acton Law Shop, a free advisory service in west London. Their English might not be good or they might be working illegally 'A lot of people just decide to keep their head down and put up with it,' she says. </p> <p>It is not just the traditional cowboy employers who are breaking the law. A church cleaner of 20 years' standing recently accepted an out-of-court settlement from her employer, a Baptist church, which was paying her only \u00a340 a week for work that she said took 40 hours. Since the church also provided accommodation, it regarded the payments to her as just pocket money. </p> <p>Many honest, middle class families in Britain may be shocked to discover that they are breaking the law in the way they deal with their cleaners. Even if they assume that Ms Mopp is self-employed, a tribunal could easily decide differently. </p> <p>Anna Barlow, who is dealing with one such claim now, believes that people who retain cleaners or gardeners should pay the minimum wage, give notice if they want to end the relationship and consider giving four weeks' paid holiday a year. </p> <p>'It depends on the facts of each case,' she says. 'The likelihood is that these issues won't be raised by the cleaners but if something goes wrong you could find yourself in front of a tribunal. At the very least, there should be a discussion with the cleaner about the issue of employment.' </p> <p>The good news for some employees is that certain issues can be resolved just by providing the employer with more information. Small businesses in particular may not appreciate the way the law has changed. There is a common misapprehension, for instance, that employees do not get rights to paid holiday in their first three months of employment. While it is true that they cannot claim paid holidays if they leave after three months, they are entitled retrospectively to the full four weeks of paid holiday once they have been with the same employer for 12 months. </p> <p>Barlow has found that many employers are happy to do the right thing in these circumstances once they know what it is. </p> <p>Many employees will get what is due only if they educate their bosses. Like all pieces of new legislation, the regulations protecting part-timers will not have been implemented by all employers when they came into force at the beginning of July. </p> <p>But they do provide the right for part-timers to have the same hourly pay rate as full-timers doing the same job. </p> <p>This, sadly, is where the law is letting down many people. Some jobs - like those of school dinner ladies - are only ever done on a part-time basis. And this law has not been drawn up in a way that will help them. </p> <p>It will take years for the employment revolution that started with these reforms to be completed. Those who want to benefit may have to find their own ways of enforcing the new laws. </p> <p>\u0095 Low Pay Unit helpline: 020- 7713 7583 </p> <p><strong>Work for Mr D. Odgy?</strong></p> <p>If you do not want to be short-changed by your bosses, a good start is to recognise a cowboy employer and get out fast. Here are some of the signs of shady operators. </p> <p>\u0095 They operate under a range of business names. There is headed notepaper in the office giving different business names for the same employer. Although you know them as 'Smellie Cars', they also seem to do business as 'Cowboy Cabs' and 'Dodgy Drivers'. </p> <p>Although there could be innocent explanations, they may also be specialists in running up debts under one limited company and then transferring the remnants of the business to another. </p> <p>\u0095 The name of the employer shown on your payslip is one you do not recognise. </p> <p>You have rights which you can claim against your employer, but if you have no knowledge of the 'M Mouse Ltd' mentioned on your payslip, you may have difficulty enforcing those rights. In some unscrupulous set-ups, people and companies are named as employers even though they live in a different country and have no real connection with the business. Sometimes they are merely the brother of the true owner, which provides a useful escape route for anyone wanting to avoid debts they have run up. </p> <p>\u0095They do not give you payslips. </p> <p>You have a legal right to a payslip. </p> <p>\u0095 They are reluctant to give you the written employment contract which is your legal right. </p> <p>Since a contract sets out the basis for your relationship, you are on very rocky territory if you do not have a written record of the basic terms. Bosses find it far easier to cut your hours or pay, for instance, if there is nothing on paper. </p> <p><strong>Know your rights: main employee protections</strong></p> <p><strong> Your contract</strong> </p> <p>You have a basic right to a written employment contract, giving details such as hours, place of work and pay. You are also entitled to pay slips. </p> <p><strong> Pay</strong> </p> <p>Anyone aged 22 or over must be paid at least \u00a33.60 an hour (rising to \u00a33.70 in October). Those aged 18 to 21 get a minimum of \u00a33.20. Some groups are excluded - among them au pairs, prisoners and family members working in a family business. </p> <p><strong> Sick pay</strong> </p> <p>You are entitled to receive statutory sick pay if you earn more than \u00a367 a week. If your employer runs a more generous scheme than the statutory minimum - a flat rate of \u00a360.20 a week - you could get more. </p> <p><strong> Holidays</strong> </p> <p>You are due four weeks' paid holiday a year. </p> <p><strong> Hours</strong> </p> <p>In most jobs, you cannot be forced to work more than an average of 48 hours a week, but the rules are complicated. There are many other rules on length of shifts, working days and rights to breaks. </p> <p><strong> Maternity pay</strong> </p> <p>The rules are a nightmare of complexity, but all working mothers are entitled to 18 weeks' maternity leave. Most women will qualify for statutory maternity pay or maternity allowance. Many employers offer more generous schemes than the statutory minimum. You cannot be discriminated against because you are pregnant or have a family - although there are, in reality, many instances of women being fired. </p> <p><strong> Parental leave</strong> </p> <p>If you have worked for your employer for more than a year you qualify for 13 weeks of unpaid parental leave to be taken before your new-born is five. Although the rules apply to mothers and fathers, few men are expected to take it since the leave is unpaid. </p> <p><strong> Health and safety</strong> </p> <p>Your employer should by law provide a 'healthy and safe' working environment. Many employers, even the largest ones, are in breach of their obligations under the detailed H&amp;S rules. The TUC estimates that 2 million people a year are injured at work. </p> <p><strong> Discrimination</strong> </p> <p>Discrimination on grounds of sex or race is unlawful (although there are no special legal provisions to tackle discrimination on grounds of age, religion or sexual orientation). In theory, there is no cap on the damages available through an employment tribunal but, apart from a few headline cases, damages are rarely spectacular. The fact that women on average earn just 75 per cent of male salaries is dealt with separately under the Equal Pay Act: the remedy is equal pay, not unlimited damages. </p> <p><strong> Redundancy</strong> </p> <p>There are (intricate) rules governing statutory redundancy pay for workers of two years' standing. The minimum depends on your age, salary level and length of employment with that employer. A person aged between 22 and 40, for instance, will get one week's pay (capped at \u00a3220 a week) for each year of service. Many employers are more generous. There are extensive rules on consultation. </p> <p><strong> Where can I can get more information?</strong> </p> <p>A new easy-to-read book, Your Rights at Work - the TUC Guide, will be published by Kogan Page in September and available in bookshops.

  "<p>As a nation we take seven days off sick each year on average. But more and more employers are becoming sceptical about our absences and taking measures to reduce them. They have a point. Research conducted by the IRS publication Employee Health Bulletin suggests that much sick leave is cultural or emotional, rather than physical. </p> <p> 'Absence levels within organisations vary widely between departments, sections and work groups,' conclude the authors of the research. The survey of 182 employers also found that women take more time off than men; that managers take less time off through sickness than other employees; and that absence rates are higher in large companies than small ones and higher in the public sector than in private businesses. </p> <p> The country's largest private sector employer, Tesco, has concluded that there are many attitudinal factors in taking sick leave. 'If you don't think you are likely to be missed, you are more likely to take time off,' says Keith Luxon, human resources policy manager. A year ago, Tesco's absenteeism rate was 5.8 per cent. Now it is down by a fifth to 4.6 per cent. </p> <p> This follows the implementation of new 'attendance management procedures'. As a result, some of the supermarket chain's 175,000 workers have been dismissed because of the time they have taken off sick. Some may think this a harsh approach, but Tesco is happy to talk about its reasons. 'We wanted more openness and honesty about absence,' says Luxon. 'We are operating in an incredibly tight market, which is forcing us to control costs wherever we can. Absenteeism was costing us between \u00a330 million and \u00a340m a year, and it was impacting on customer service. If you operate with 5.8 per cent of your staff away, you have fewer tills open and fewer goods on the shelf.' </p> <p> Every Tesco employee who takes sick leave of any duration has to have a 'return to work' interview with one of the store managers. In a substantial number of cases, it has emerged that the person was off for domestic or family reasons - looking after a sick child, for example. If this is the case, the employee is given various options about how they want to treat that time: it could be taken as holiday, as unpaid leave, or set off against overtime, but they will not get it for free. </p> <p> People who have two periods of sickness within 24 weeks are then drawn into the 'attendance management' process, where their attendance is monitored. If they then have a third absence, or if their total time off sick goes above 5 per cent, they are interviewed again and banned from doing overtime for six weeks. </p> <p> In the interview, they will be asked more about their time off - whether there are common patterns to the different periods of illness. Occupational health services will be made available if a pattern is established - if, for example, they are suffering from repeated back trouble or if they want to space their shifts out differently. If over the next 12 weeks their sickness record does not improve, they get another interview and probably a verbal warning. They will be told: 'We can't run a business effectively on this level of absence.' </p> <p> If within the next eight weeks there is no improvement in absenteeism levels, they could get a final written warning, and then it is possible that they could be sacked. Tesco says it has tried to be fair and open with staff. An employee will not have to go through this process if there is a clear medical problem. Employment lawyer Michael Burd of solicitor Lewis Silkin believes that many other employers will follow this type of example. Persistent or repeated sickness is one of the most difficult issues for employers to deal with at the moment, he says. 'Doctors seem all too ready to dish out medical certificates giving quite vague reasons for an inability to work.' </p> <p> Burd says he is constantly dealing with medical reports which say simply 'stress', 'hypertension and work-related stress' or even 'work-related stress _ Mr X should not return to work until the problems there are resolved'. He adds: 'Doctors are doing this with the best interests of their patients in mind. But they sometimes just take that person's word for it. And they have no concept of the kind of legal problems this approach can lead to.' </p> <p>He has frequently seen businesses come under great pressure when a staff member is suddenly signed off for two months. Unless the employment contract states that the employer can get an independent medical assessment, the employee is protected. Under the confidentiality rules for patients, doctors can not give out any personal information unless they have the patient's consent. </p> <p> Even when consent is given, the doctors are often not forthcoming. Burd quotes the following 'report' he received from a GP: 'X attended my surgery on X date. I formed the opinion she was unfit to return to work as a result of that consultation. Yours sincerely...' Another part of the reason why employers are clamping down where they can is the Disability Discrimination Act. </p> <p>This gives a lot of protection to employees who have long-term illnesses, which could last for more than a year. Even if an employee suffers from depression and is away for long periods of time, and the company is suffering as a result, the employer will need to be very careful about taking disciplinary steps. Damages that can be awarded under the Act are unlimited. Tesco has decided that the comfort of its staff cannot be ranked above the interests of its customers in this regard. As Lewis Silkin's Burd points out, many other employers are sure to follow suit.</p>",
  "<p> <strong>1: </strong> Recognise that you will be miles ahead of the pack if you produce different CVs for different jobs.

Its purpose is not to reflect your infinite variety but to beat the other 150 applicants trying to get on to the employer's shortlist.<br> </p> <p> <strong> 2:</strong> Mould your CV to the job advertisement. If the ad says they want someone dynamic and responsible, you should think of ways you can demonstrate those qualities in the CV you send. Keep the ad in front of you as you write. <br> </p> <p> <strong> 3:</strong> Avoid writing more than two pages, check your spellings and make the layout clear and attractive. A personnel officer will be looking for reasons to throw out applicants if they have to sift a large number of CVs. After putting your name and contact details at the top, put in a 'personal profile', suggests Lynn Williams, author of Kogan Page's Readymade CVs (\u00a38.99 in bookshops). This will be a one-paragraph snapshot of information to be expanded elsewhere, including 'a brief, business-like description of yourself, personal qualities, experience and skills and strengths'. <br> </p> <p> <strong> 4: </strong> Include next a few bullet points headed, 'personal skills'. This 'can save anyone reading your CV a lot of time and effort', says Williams. It would subtly echo some of the job ad requirements, and say things such as 'management of large canteens', 'keyboard skills - 40wpm' and 'dealing with people effectively and tactfully'.<br> </p> <p> <strong> 5:</strong> Remember that most employers want many similar qualities in staff: people who are willing to learn, are enthusiastic, accurate, friendly, turn up on time and fit in. Look for ways to slot proof of these attributes into your CV. Giving two or three lively outside interests is one way - especially if these include 'organising a local charity fun run' and playing team sports. <br> </p> <p> <strong> 6:</strong> Give the usual educational and career details. Summarise parts that happened more than a decade ago. Try to make every line back your suitability, so give a two-line summary of your role, such as 'hiring staff, achieving targets'. <br> </p> <p><strong> 7: </strong> Provide a final paragraph of 'personal details': your birth date, driving licence and references, for instance. Don't clutter it with unnecessary information about spouse, children, nationality or religion. Exclude your age if you wish - but some employers will be irritated and may exclude you.</p>",

  "<p>When I leapt out of an aeroplane for the 27th time, it was, without doubt, the 27th most scary thing I had ever done. It was my last jump of a training course at Lake Elsinore Skydiving Center in southern California, arguably the best drop zone in the world. It had been an intense week, during which I faced overwhelming fear, my own mental and physical limitations and the sensory overload that hits you when you step outside a plane two miles up. And I wouldn't have missed it for the world. </p> <p>Driven irresistibly by a combination of mid-life crisis, dreams of flying and, bizarrely, a fear of heights, I booked up for an AFF course run in the United States by British company PhD Skydiving. AFF stands for Accelerated Freefall, but I was relieved to hear that \"accelerated\" refers not to the speed with which I was likely to hit the ground, but the rapid rate of learning. </p> <p>This system takes you directly to 45 seconds of freefall on your first exit from the plane at 12,000ft, albeit with two instructors holding on to you very firmly until they are sure you have safely pulled your ripcord. You then receive instructions on a walkie-talkie to help you land. </p> <p>There were three things I had to learn before I could be considered safe. The first was acquiring the stable position that enables you to control your body in the 120mph airflow. Get this right, and you are just about flying, using small movements of arms and legs to turn, slide and swoop. Get it wrong, which I did more than once, and you are a tumbling, spinning ball of limbs and panic, whose parachute lines could be hopelessly tangled if there wasn't an instructor there to sort you out before you pull the ripcord. </p> <p>The second skill is that of safely opening your parachute at the right height, and knowing what to do should it fail to open properly. Not something I ever want to experience, but it's as well to be prepared. </p> <p>The third is being able to fly and land your canopy. Parachutes have come a long way since the silk umbrellas of the second world war. They are more like a foldable glider wing that can be turned, steered and braked. With practice, you can land gently on tip-toes. </p> <p><strong> The course</strong><br> </p> <p> The AFF course consists of a series of lectures and briefings, followed by eight training jumps, first accompanied by two instructors, later by a single instructor and finally alone. All jumps are recorded on video and analysed. There are tasks to complete on each jump, with failure meaning a re-take - and therein lies a trap for the unwary. Although the package price includes all eight levels, re-jumps cost extra and, as you might be paying for two instructors, the costs can quickly mount. I easily racked up an extra \u00a3500 getting it right. </p> <p>Once you have completed all eight AFF levels, you must do 10 solo jumps to earn your \"A\" licence, a sort of basic international driving licence that declares you safe enough to jump with no further supervision. The AFF system is by no means cheap, but is certainly the most cost-effective way of getting qualified fast. </p> <p><strong> The requirements</strong><br> </p> <p> You don't have to be particularly fit, although the British Parachute Association demands a medical certificate for new trainees over 40 years of age. I met people in their 60s and 70s who jump every weekend. The sport is naturally very safety-conscious, and equipment failures are thankfully rare. All parachute rigs come with a reserve canopy in case the main one fails, and a computer chip that will pull the cord for you in the worst-case scenario. </p> <p>By the second half of the week, I was jumping solo - falling through the air for nearly a minute, watching the ground come up at 120mph, and knowing that I had the power in my right hand to save my life. My instructor complimented me on my confident exits from the plane door - little did he realise that if I didn't go quickly I wasn't going at all. I never did stop being scared, but I did learn how to work with the fear and use it. </p> <p><strong> The location</strong><br> </p> <p> Why go all the way to Elsinore to do this, when you could take the same course in the UK? \"The weather,\" says PhD instructor Martin Williams. \"Here we can guarantee you all the jumps you need to qualify in a week. Back home, it could take months, even a year. Also the safety and the facilities, which are second to none.\" </p> <p>Elsinore nestles at the base of the Ortega mountains half way between Los Angeles and San Diego, which gives it a uniquely warm and cloudless microclimate that provides good jumping weather every day of the year. Parachuting has been taking place here for more than 40 years, and some claim this where skydiving was invented. </p> <p>Skydivers flock to Elsinore from all round the world. I met Japanese, Israeli, Canadian, Australian, South African and British pilgrims. At the weekend, Californians turn up in their hordes- whole families, who set up tents and barbecues, bring the kids, music, grub, and skydive all day. I watched around 600 jumps on my first Saturday. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> I stayed at the Casino Motel in Elsinore (+ 909 674 3101), which is pretty much the way it sounds. The focus is the 24-hour casino; rooms are provided so the gamblers don't wander too far away. It's not over-smart, but it provides all the amenities you are likely to need - air conditioning, TV, bath and shower, laundry, food and drink day or night. </p> <p>But the truth is, it hardly mattered where I stayed, because I barely left the drop zone - the first aeroplane ride was at 8.30am and jumping and training lasted until the sudden and dramatic nightfall at around 8.30pm, at which point everyone broke out coolers of beer, and stood around drinking, chatting, laughing, and reviewing the day's activities on video. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> We rarely got away before 9.30pm, by which time just about everything in Elsinore is closed. Most nights, we ate back at the Casino Motel, or at Denny's, both of which provide a typical American menu of plentiful, if mostly fried, food 24 hours a day. </p> <p>If you do manage to get away before 9pm, go downtown for a Mexican meal at Guadalajara (909 674 8924), or an Italian at Vincenzos (909 674 8941). Best of all, go into Temecula, the next town, and enjoy a Thai banquet at the Bangkok Chef, 27451 Jefferson Ave (909 676 0850) - definitely the culinary highlight of my week. </p> <p><strong> Where to drink</strong><br> </p> <p> If you're feeling brave, you could come back to Elsinore for a late-night drink at the Hideway (32392 Mission Trail), a tiny shack of a bar straight out of a \"B\" movie - a line of Harley-Davidsons outside, huge bearded bikers and bikini-clad pole-dancers inside. With the same laid-back friendliness that permeates the whole of southern California, it manages to be seedy and wholesome, threatening and relaxing, at the same time. Not to be missed. </p> <p><strong> Beyond skydiving</strong><br> </p> <p> If you grow bored with skydiving, you could spend a day at the lake - though, frankly, I still think the best view of it is from 12,000ft. Here you can hire Jet Skis (DMP Motor Sports, 909 814 2268), go water skiing (California Skier, 909 674 7900), or wander round the nearby Main Street and view the \"antique\" shops - selling mostly 60s and 70s Americana. While you're there, stop off at Chuckles Java Junction (141 Main Lake St, 909 674 5600), and enjoy one of a selection of 30 or so coffees. They also provide live music and entertainment in the evenings, and Tai-Chi classes on Friday mornings. </p> <p>If you really want to spoil yourself, hire a car (Enterprise Rent-a-car, 158 Campbell Street, 909 245 7997, $38.99 per day for a Saturn, plus discount if you book through the skydiving centre) and treat yourself to a really luxurious day off. Take a trip up the freeway to Glen Ivy, and spend a day at the Hot Spring Spa (1 800 454 8722). Admission to the spa and mud bath costs $29 at weekends, $24 weekdays, and then you can indulge in a whole range of esoteric herbal and massage treatments, right up to the full-day Paradise Package at $300. </p> <p>Mostly, though, I was swept up in the microcosm that was the drop zone. I won't bore you with the friendly rivalries between Formation Skydivers (who do it on their bellies), the young cool Freeflyers (who do it on their heads), and the balletic Freestylers (who do it every which way). Suffice to say that it is an engrossing alternate reality, full of friendly fun-seekers, and very welcoming to the newcomer. </p> <p>I was warned that skydiving could be addictive, but given my level of fear throughout, I was doubtful that I would get hooked. After my 27th jump, my only prayer was \"Thank God, I never have to do that again.\" But a day later, back in the UK, I caught myself thinking: \"I wonder where my nearest drop zone is? Maybe next weekend...\"</p> <p><strong>The practicals </strong></p> <p>An AFF &amp; BPA Cat 8 (\"A\" Licence) package in Lake Elsinore costs \u00a32,300 through <a href=\"http://www.phdskydiving.co.uk\">PhD Skydiving</a> in Wiltshire (01980 621363).

  "<p>My first family holiday abroad, at the age of six or seven, was spent in Brittany, in a little white hotel beside a beach. And it seemed a very strange place. </p> <p>None of the staff spoke English, and the only other foreigners in the hotel were Enoch Powell and his family. He and my father, who was a Labour MP, nodded to each other rather abruptly on the first day, and thereafter neither family spoke or made any acknowledgement of each other's presence, playing separate games of cricket on different ends of the beach. But I remember Powell's strangulated Midlands vowels drifting across from the other side of the dining room: \"And now children, you will always remember this day for the first time you ever ate... lobster!\" </p> <p>I don't know what the Mallalieu children were eating - or more likely refusing to eat. It was cold, blue, and shiny, possibly some kind of pickled fish or vegetable. It bore no relation to anything we could recognise as food. In those days, olive oil was something most English people put in their ears. </p> <p>The only soft drink at the hotel was a fizzy orange called Pschitt. We would ask the waiters: \"Un orange, s'il vous plait,\" and they would reply: \"Non! Pschitt!\" It was very strange. </p> <p>In the village, a short walk across the fields, the inhabitants spoke Breton, lived in picturesque poverty and earned nothing from tourism. Nearby, probably, there was a small port with decrepit fishing boats. </p> <p>There was nothing to do except play on the beach, which was fine by us. </p> <p>This month, another generation of Mallalieu children went to Brittany, and it was very different. </p> <p>The Pierre et Vacances resort at Port du Crouesty describes itself as \"un village authentique entre mer et port de plaisance,\" but it is reallynothing of the sort. It is a suburb of what has fast become a fair-sized town, and the buildings are in a \"traditional\" Breton style that no one could mistake for the real thing. It is like Poundbury-on-Sea. Twenty years ago, it didn't exist. It has no history, and the entire population changes every fortnight. There are no fishing boats in the harbour, just a thousand or more plastic yachts. All the shops are restaurants, bars, creperies and boutiques. There is no school, no cemetery and no industry other than tourism. </p> <p>It is Club 18-30 in reverse. All the guests are parents in their 30s and 40s with small children and young teenagers. The only people in their late teens and 20s are working here for the summer. Most of the staff speak English and German, but nobody speaks Breton. </p> <p>The car parks are full of sensible family cars: Fords, Peugeots, Citro\u00ebns and Renaults, but not a Mercedes or a beat-up 2CV in sight. </p> <p>The guests are mostly French, with a smaller than usual number of English, German, Dutch and Irish. Years ago, Powell looked unmistakably English, if inauthentic, paddling in the sea with his pinstripe trousers rolled up to his knees. Now in Port du Crouesty, it is impossible to tell anyone's nationality until they speak. We have all become Eurotourists. </p> <p>The food no longer tastes strange. The children are accustomed to olive oil, mussels, garlic, oysters and camembert, if not often to lobster. The restaurant menus offer a homogenised Euro-French cuisine. From what melting pot did the Pizz\u00e9ria Le Nelson emerge? </p> <p>One day, in search of the older Brittany, we went to Carnac to see the stones, but since my last visit the alignments have been fenced off, like Stonehenge, to protect them from tourists. We found a path through the woods to the great menhir, the G\u00e9ant du Manio. There were no fences, and it had been sprayed with graffiti. </p> <p>Port du Crouesty is clearly not the Brittany where Gauguin painted Le Christ Jaune and got into fights with sailors. Nor is it the kind of north French resort where Antoine Roquentin suffered his existential crisis of identity in Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea. But there has to be a good reason why so many people come here every summer, and there is. </p> <p>Protected from the Atlantic by the Quiberon peninsula, and the islands of Hoedic, Houat and Belle-Ile, the bay is possibly the best place in the whole of Europe for children to learn to sail. </p> <p>Along the rest of the Atlantic coast, the sea is usually too rough. For most of the time in the Mediterranean, there is no wind at all, and then, without warning, you get far too much. The Channel is cold, and the tides and currents often dangerous. But in Quiberon Bay, the sea is flat, sloping safely from the beach, and the wind is light to moderate all day long. </p> <p>In the afternoons, we watched unworried as the children set off into the distance in kayaks and catamarans. Then we could stroll off, unconcerned, 40 minutes south-west to an almost deserted beach, where there were no fake- Breton houses, only sand dunes, marram grass, brambles and wild fennel. </p> <p><strong> How clean are the beaches?</strong><br> </p> <p> Compared with what it must have looked like only nine months ago after the spill, the change is miraculous. There were few traces of oil, less than you would find on most English beaches - and far less rubbish - but you don't see many seabirds, and the first oyster I ate tasted of soap. It might have been the detergent used to clean up the oil, or I might have been imagining it. My younger daughter developed a rash after swimming in the sea and digging in the sand.

  "Scottish students waiting for delayed examination results were told yesterday that officials could give no guarantee of a date by which they will receive their grades. <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority revealed that 5,000 pupils had received incomplete or inaccurate grades, following a check of the results. </p> <p>The SQA said no candidates would have their grades revised downwards when the missing data was eventually added and they apologised to pupils for the distress and uncertainty caused by the fiasco. </p> <p>But the body's acting chief executive, Bill Morton, would not say when the affected pupils would get their final certification. He admitted that it could be well into next week before many are able to make decisions about their academic futures. </p> <p>\"I am not going to be held to a particular deadline. I will give you a guarantee that this organisation will do everything it can to get results for students,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I am not going to repeat the experience of raising false expectations that further disappoint. I would hope that we concentrate on getting the information to students as fast as we can.\" </p> <p>The universities and colleges admissions service said the fall in the numbers of students obtaining places through clearing across the UK was caused by the chaos in Scotland. </p> <p>The total number of students accepted on courses the day after A-level results were published was 217,062, compared with the 1999 figure of 224,731. </p> <p>The number of applicants waiting for universities to decide whether to offer them a place had risen to 105,773 compared with 92,155 at the same stage last year. But a Ucas spokesman said the number of people with university places is expected to eventually be at least as high as last year. </p> <p>Some universities have already started confirming places for students with incomplete results. </p> <p>Aberdeen University and Napier University in Edinburgh said that students with missing grades \"had waited long enough\" to have their places confirmed, and are offering admission based on preliminary results. </p> <p>Parents, teachers and education analysts, meanwhile, said the problem still appeared to be much larger than the SQA's revised figures suggested. </p> <p>\"The problem now is that the SQA have said that about 5% of the results are inaccurate. That's an awful lot less than schools are saying,\" said Lindsay Paterson, professor of education studies at Edinburgh University. </p> <p>\"Until they can explain how the schools have an impression at variance with the SQA, people are still going to have big questions about the integrity of the system.\" </p> <p>With the crisis showing no sign of ending, calls for the resignation of the education minister, Sam Galbraith, continued to mount. Yesterday, the Conservatives joined the Scottish National party in calling for him to go. </p> <p>The Conservatives' education spokesman, Brian Montieth, said students were clearly being disadvantaged in obtaining university places. </p> <p>\"A week on, the promises have not been kept,\" he said. \"It is quite clear that Sam Galbraith has failed and when a minister fails as badly as he has there is only one option left - he must resign.\" </p> <p>Mr Galbraith, meanwhile, has insisted that he will stay in his post. He said that what mattered most were the concerns of pupils and their parents. </p> <p>\"I take my position very seriously indeed in this matter,\" he said. \"My responsiblity here is to make sure that I resolve this matter\". </p> <p>\"The easy thing for me is to walk away.

  "A ruling that a university sexually discriminated against a mature student who was excluded from her degree course after a pregnancy-related illness was overturned yesterday by the court of appeal. <p>But in reversing the high court judgment of Mr Justice Munby against South Bank University, south London, three appeal judges agreed with him that the university had \"wholly misunderstood\" the basis of the case presented by Valerie Coggeran, 32, and ordered it to reconsider its decision. </p> <p>Ms Coggeran, of Tottenham, north London, completed the first two years of her three-year radiography course at City University, central London. She enrolled in September 1998 at South Bank to take the third year but later that year had surgery for the womb condition endometriosis. She became pregnant and then sick with a related illness. </p> <p>After she missed exams because of her illness, the university's examination board terminated her studies in July last year. An appeal board confirmed the decision. Her son was born last November. </p> <p>Mr Justice Munby ruled last month that the law protected not only employees from dismissal but also students from exclusion if they suffered pregnancy-related illness. </p> <p>Lords Justices Schiemann, Thorpe and Mummery said the judge had been wrong to make such a ruling on the interpretation of the law because Ms Coggeran had brought civil proceedings for alleged sex discrimination which were pending at Lambeth county court, and only that court had jurisdiction in the case. </p> <p>A spokesman for South Bank said it would review Ms Coggeran's case by next month.</p>",
  "<p>Still best known for his lead in Merchant-Ivory's A Room With A View, 15 years ago, Julian Sands has kept a relatively low profile in Hollywood and Europe since, but has worked with everyone from David Cronenberg to the Taviani brothers. In recent years, he's appeared in five Mike Figgis films, including his latest, Time Code, in which he plays the clown-like Quentin, an interfering masseur to the Hollywood hotheads.</p> <p><strong>How did you and Mike get together? </strong></p> <p>It came about when I was at drama school. I was a big fan of the People Show, in which Mike was a performer, and when I heard he was making films I was very interested to meet him. When we did The Browning Version I think we developed a good shorthand for working together. Then I played the strange creature in Leaving Las Vegas, and the male nurse to Rob Downey's bottom in One Night Stand, then Loss Of Sexual Innocence which was in some way the most important thing I've worked on. Mike likes to have an ensemble of familiar people around him, like forming a band. </p> <p><strong>How did your character come about?</strong></p> <p>Mike first wanted me to play one of the executives - a token Oxbridge Brit in the Hollywood studio - and I ventured that I became an actor to avoid being that, so could I try something else? I had this idea for a masseur, who's a bit based on my younger brother, Quentin, who came through LA a few years ago where he had a pretty naughty time being a masseur. Also Mike was one of the cameramen, and I think the reason he allowed me to be a masseur is between filming I would give him a shoulder rub. </p> <p><strong>So you were the off-set masseur as well? </strong></p> <p>I was the group groper. I was everyone's bitch. </p> <p><strong>Shooting it must have been pretty different.</strong></p> <p>The only way we could make sense of who was going to be where and when was by using sheet music, with each bar representing five minutes. We rehearsed it through a couple of times but really we learned it by doing it, and after each run-through we would chill for an hour or two and then watch it back (on four monitors) and refine it some more. Also everybody was very exposed to each other. Nobody could disappear to their trailer once it was up and running, you were all there on the same stage. It was only 10 days of rehearsal and 10 days of shooting, which was very very tiring.</p> <p><strong>So how many versions were shot?</strong></p> <p>Fifteen. So some days we were shooting one in the morning and one in the afternoon. It was always so different depending on the time of day, the light, the traffic, what mood people were in; sometimes they were feeling snappy and could improvise a funny spiel and other times they were mute. </p> <p><strong>You've come a long way since A Room With A View.</strong></p> <p>That became an international reference point with which I could very easily be pigeonholed. I was in my mid-20s when I did that and now I'm 41. A lot of the work I've done since then has been more substantial perhaps but much less viewed, which is a choice I feel quite lucky to have had. I can't think of anything since that has been that widely viewed. </p> <p><strong>Boxing Helena? </strong></p> <p>The thing about that was every single person who went on to trash it was an enthusiast for the project originally. It was the hottest kind of project around and it was written about all the time, which, of course, is a great warning sign. But the way it was received was almost career-ending for everybody, which was an interesting sort of experience to endure. And by the way, I quite like the result.</p>",
  "The body of Dexter Horace Coleman was released to his family yesterday, and any day now it will be flown back to his native Jamaica for burial. The shot that killed him was fired one night last month, after several carloads of Asian men wielding guns, machetes and swords swooped on the 27-year-old and his friends outside the Young Lion cafe in the Manningham district of Bradford, a vibrant social hub for the city's tiny Afro-Caribbean population. <p>Some witnesses put the size of the gang at 20 or 30; others at nearer 100. Either way, one of them, wearing a balaclava, shot Coleman in the back at close range, probably with a .45 calibre semi-automatic handgun. By the time an ambulance arrived, about 30 minutes later, he was dead. </p> <p>Although 14 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, police have yet to charge anyone with murder. But Coleman's friends already think they know what killed him. </p> <p>Outside the Young Lion - closed indefinitely now, its boarded windows bearing tributes and its front lined with bouquets - a scrap of paper makes their feelings clear. \"Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is discredited and abandoned,\" it reads, \"and until the colour of a man's skin is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes, there will be war.\" </p> <p>The murder is one of a spate of shootings that have brought panic to Bradford. On July 18, four days after Coleman's death, an Asian man in his 20s was shot and wounded on a Manningham street; at the end of the month a 16-year-old Asian youth was abducted and beaten so severely he could scarcely walk. </p> <p>Bullets have rained through the front of an Indian restaurant, and into the window of a flat in a quiet residential street. Arrests have been made and charges brought in connection with several attacks, which are thought to be drug-related and to involve both Asian and white perpetrators. </p> <p>Police stress that these attacks are not connected to Coleman's murder. Nevertheless, the shootings have bestowed once again on Manningham a reputation for violence it has been struggling to shake off since the riots of 1995, when youths threw petrol bombs, looted shops and torched cars over three summer nights. </p> <p><b> Persecution</b><br> </p> <p> Yet Coleman's death is unique in the way it has crystallised a perception among many in Bradford's Afro-Caribbean community, which numbers just 6,000, that they are victims of racial persecution - not from the white majority but from some members of the city's 87,000-strong Asian population. The shooting at the cafe - which had been firebombed twice - has fuelled a growing fear for the community's survival and the belief, among some, that there is a concerted campaign to drive them from the city. </p> <p>\"The Asians have everything,\" said one of the young black men smoking on the steps outside the Young Lion. He will not give his name, but says he was injured in the mass attack on July 14. \"White and black folks, we're doing all right, but the Asians get everything handed down to them. When they talk about having all these things for the community - housing schemes, all that stuff - which community do they mean? </p> <p>\"I remember fighting the National Front out here just to keep Asians and blacks here. Now they're fighting us.\" </p> <p>\"If this were anywhere else there would be anarchy,\" said Bingi, a local black activist, outside the Frontline Initiative community centre next to the Young Lion, now a solitary outpost of education and advice for Manningham's Afro-Caribbeans. \"But because this is England, because of the way it is policed, it stops some things happening. But things are boiling underneath.\" </p> <p>Asian community workers and older Muslims at the Markazi Jamia mosque opposite the cafe insist that drugs rather than racism are at the root of Coleman's death. \"It's nothing to do with race,\" said Azhar Khan, senior worker at the Manningham Advice Project. \"This territory has traditionally been controlled by some drug dealers who happen to be black. </p> <p><b> Hooligans</b><br> </p> <p> \"And that's all it is. The community in general - decent Asian people and decent black people - they have no problem. It's just a certain category of people who are rejected even by their own community. They're all bloody hooligans.\" </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Chris Gregg of West Yorkshire police, who is leading the murder inquiry, believes the attack stemmed from an altercation between two women at a pub earlier in the week, and a confrontation at a betting shop at which Coleman was not present. \"We are treating this as an incident between a group of individuals,\" he said. \"The incident in the public house had nothing to do with racial tension.\" One member of the attacking gang was believed to have been Afro-Caribbean. </p> <p>But Coleman's death has drawn attention to festering problems that cannot be dismissed. The decline of black-run businesses in Manningham - alongside the growth of community centres and mosques catering for the area's diverse Islamic population - is a particularly sore point. Where once around 20 black-owned shops thrived there is now one pub, the Frontline Initiative, the boarded-up cafe and MNR Stores, a West Indian mini-market. </p> <p>\"There's not much we have anymore,\" said a man behind the shop's counter. \"That cafe was there from day one, the only place black people had to go and congregate. Now we have nowhere to go.\" </p> <p><b> Success story</b><br> </p> <p> The 1995 riots seared Manningham in the national imagination as a crisis-ridden inner-city slum teeming with rioters and riot police. Actually - that tragic summer excepted - it has proved a startling success story, providing a largely tension-free home to a big proportion of the city's Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Afro-Caribbean residents. Police report significant improvements in their relations with people from all backgrounds. </p> <p>Bev Higgins, joint project coordinator at Frontline, said she had no personal experience of a racial divide but agreed something precious had been lost. \"We've been getting along in Manningham since the year dot,\" she said. \"I think many people round here now think something - some element of control - has been lost. </p> <p>\"The youth appear to be lawless; they don't have that old respect for the community code. And it's a personal thing, something you can't explain just by economics, or social provision, or whether you got any GCSEs or not. Something, somewhere, has gone wrong.\" </p> <p>Marsha Singh, MP for Bradford West, is demanding an emergency meeting with the three party leaders of the city's hung council to address the needs of the Afro-Caribbean population. But he does not sound optimistic about the outcome. </p> <p>\"This happens when you talk to any community,\" he said. \"The white community will say the Asians get everything, and the Asians, too, feel their needs are not being met. This is a circle which goes round and round, and you can never catch its tail.\" </p> <p>The flowers are beginning to wilt outside the Young Lion; the cards have warped in the rain. Police have charged six men with violent disorder in connection with the attack and another with robbery at the nearby betting shop. Seven more remain on bail. </p> <p>But Coleman may be long buried before the identity of his killer is known. Nevertheless, Bev Higgins at Frontline remains defiantly hopeful, reeling off a list of projects in Manningham either up and running or in the pipeline: a homework club, a salsa group, a women's social club, an employment project, an internet cafe. </p> <p>\"It's Manningham,\" she said, matter-of-factly. \"Whatever happens, this community will get up, and dust itself off, and we will start again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Online shopping saves you money. That's the message e-tailers are bleating non-stop to woo you away from the high street and grab your hard-earned cash. But with the deluge of companies that now sell online, how do you know you've really got a bargain? Can you be sure there isn't an even better deal around the e-corner? And how would you find that cheaper site anyway? </p> <p>Yannis Bakos, professor of management at New York University, has studied online retailing. \"The more difficult it is for consumers to search for cheaper prices, the more sellers can charge for their goods,\" he says. </p> <p> In a nutshell, this is the foundation for monopolising the market, and that's what sites like DealTime, Shopper and ShopSmart aim to stop. These sites don't actually sell anything, instead they scour the net for deals on the things you want to buy. Type in the name of an item on DealTime, for example, and the site offers up a table of results showing the price of the product, shipping costs, a link to the e-tailer's site and - when possible - gives a trustworthiness score based on one of the online trading accreditation schemes. </p> <p>At present, most comparison shopping sites are geared towards gadgetry and computer equipment, CDs, DVDs, books and videogames. The size of the bargains vary, depending on the product, but getting away from big names is sure to help. According to recent research, though Amazon's prices are by no means the cheapest in the market, the company still commands 80% of online book sales worldwide (see table below for sample price comparisons). </p> <p>One drawback of these large price comparison sites is that many only include a select group of online retailers. These are picked for their quality of service and reliability - which is a good thing in itself. But this fact does mean that you could be missing out on a much cheaper deal on some small site elsewhere, which quite possibly represents a company just down the road. </p> <p>Here intelligent comparison shopping agents come in handy. RUSure is one such helper. First you have to download the program to your computer. The software then pops up a window on your screen that sits there monitoring your surfing. If the program detects that you are visting an online retailer it scurries off in the background hunting for another shop that offers the product you're looking at for cheaper and reports back, prompting you with the lower price it's found. </p> <p>Automatic agents, like RUSure, do have drawbacks. For one thing, you may not like to be watched by the software. The company will collect detailed information on all your surfing actvities, including the banner ads you click on, the sites you visit and where you shop. If you submit personal details, RUSure will match the profile to your name and identify this information with your computer. It may also share this information with third parties. </p> <p>Comparing prices isn't the only way to get a bargain. The old idea of bulk buying, now re-branded as \"co-buying\", is resurfacing in many websites. The principle is: if a group of people get together to buy a large quantity of products direct from the manufacturer, cutting out the chain of middle-men, then the price to each individual is likely to be much lower. </p> <p>Letsbuyit has been running co-buying schemes for over a year and has attracted 800,000 members to its online shoppers community. It has grabbed top buyers from many traditional high street retailers and is striking deals with manufacturers to provide goods at savings of up to 60% in comparison with high street prices. At the time of writing, a wide screen TV was on sale for \u00a3799 on the site, compared with a high street price of around \u00a31,200. </p> <p>Letsbuyit sets up a co-buy by negotiating a low price for an item with the manufacturer. It then advertises the co-buy on its website with a time limit and a quota of units for sale. As more people sign up to buy the item, the price falls until the whole quota is sold and the lowest price possible is reached. If the time limit expires before all the units are sold the customers pay a slightly higher price. </p> <p>An example of the bizarre power of co-buying is Letsbuyit's deal with Amerada Gas. The domestic gas suppliers will sell you gas marginally cheaper if you sign up through Letsbuyit. </p> <p>Co-buying has been adopted by MyTaxi too, a shopping site that aims to cater for all your online shopping needs. MyTaxi also offers price comparison tools, and lets you build your own shopping portal with links to your favourite online retailers. </p> <p>But perhaps the pi\u00e8ce de resistance of online shopping is the mighty Priceline, which lets you name your own price for the goods it sells. Priceline is huge in the US, with 7m customers to date. </p> <p>The idea is simple: you name a price for a ticket, hotel room, or other item you want to buy, and Priceline goes off and tries to find a company that will sell it to you for that price (factoring in a small commission for Priceline). If no one matches the price, Priceline will buy the product for you, providing your price is reasonable, and honour your price. On average, customers in the US save 54% on airline tickets. </p> <p>There are some checks and balances so that priceline doesn't end up selling flights to Hawai for nothing. Priceline says airline companies will sell tickets at up to 30% below the lowest price they have ever sold the ticket, 50% of the time. It will match the prices accordingly. Priceline will be available to Europeans this autumn. </p> <p>\"These are all great opportunities for the consumer,\" says Richard Webb of the Trading Standards Institute, \"but we would just encourage people not to act on impulse or rely solely on what the web sites offer. It's important to shop around.\" </p> <p>And remember, one drawback of online bargain hunting is that you usually have to wait days, or even weeks, for your cut-price find to arrive. Perhaps it's unwise to give up on the high street sales just yet. </p> <p> <strong> Online details</strong> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.shopsmart.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.shopsmart.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.letsbuyit.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.letsbuyit.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusure.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rusure.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dealtime.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dealtime.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mytaxi.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.mytaxi.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shoptour.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.shoptour.co.uk</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shopgenie.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.shopgenie.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.priceline.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.priceline.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"www.clickthebutton.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.clickthebutton.com</a></p> <p><strong>What they charge</strong><br> Prices for: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by JK Rowling, Comparison shop performed on ShopSmart (include s delivery): </p> <p> The Good Book Guide \u00a39.44 <br>WHSmith \u00a39.75 <br>Ottakar's \u00a39.95 <br>Waterstones \u00a39.95 <br>Gillihams \u00a310.24 <br>Amazon.co.uk \u00a311.74 <br>CountryBookShop \u00a312.94 <br>StudentBookWorld \u00a313.69 <br>SpaceStore \u00a314.24</p>",
  "<b> Dear Alan Roff,</b> <br> <p> For the life of me I cannot see the point of some of the new, so-called vocational degrees in car selling, curry making, beauty therapy, rock music and golf, to name but a few. </p> <p>Each of these areas has industries associated with it. There may well be a case for some hard practical work-related courses, but why pad them out with quasi-academic philosophy, sociology and the rest, and call them degrees? </p> <p>Everyone loses: students waste three valuable years developing a false consciousness; employers are left with a lot of nonsense to knock out; the raison d'\u00eatre of universities is compromised and the country misses out on the practical-technical skills base vital for a competitive economy. </p> <p>What seems to drive this madness is the need to meet ever-increasing, but arbitrary, participation targets. Never mind the quality, feel the width. I am not saying that the \"philosophy of golf\" or \"the horse in Europe\" cannot be interesting, and if students want to back their wish to study them by paying, fine. But, as a taxpayer, I would like to see the government investing the money it takes from me in something more meaningful. </p> <p>Best wishes, </p> <p>Alan Smithers.<br>Director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research, <br>The University of Liverpool </p> <p><b> Dear Alan,</b> </p> <p> Your letter seems to contain a general argument about vocational degrees and an implied set of specific arguments about a list of specific named courses. I am not sure that we gain much by trying to deal with the latter, as no British university offers degrees in things like \"car selling\" or \"the horse in Europe\". </p> <p>But 30 years ago, when I was a mathematics undergraduate, some people looked down on engineering as being purely vocational. Ten years on, I became heavily involved in the development of business studies degrees and subsequently, business information systems degrees, which again took time to gain acceptance. However, the intellectual and practical demands on students (in terms of knowledge of several disciplines; the ability to synthesise this knowledge, to apply it to complex problems and to communicate the results) were certainly comparable to those required in more traditional disciplines. </p> <p>I dwell on this because it took place prior to the more recent expansion of higher education and was certainly not driven by any obsession with targets. </p> <p>Business studies and engineering attempt to provide both rigorous theory and the ability to apply that theory. This is hardly radical. The BA in philosophy here does the same, giving students a clear grounding in philosophical theory and then encouraging its application to important ethical issues, for example. </p> <p>Our experience is that they are intellectually challenging and have an excellent record in terms of graduates securing jobs and making a big contribution to the UK economy. That seems to me to be a good use of your taxes. </p> <p>Best wishes, </p> <p>Alan Roff, <br>Deputy vice-chancellor, <br>University of Central Lancashire </p> <p><b> Dear Alan,</b><br> </p> <p> All the examples I give are real. \"Car selling\" is automotive retail management at Loughborough and \"the horse in Europe\" is an option in Equine Studies at Coventry. The fact that you thought I had made them up suggests that you are not entirely convinced either. </p> <p>There is no long-standing rejection of the vocational as you imply. Universities began with medicine, law and the church. Originally, it was academic subjects like the sciences that had to fight for their place. More recently, a number of vocational disciplines, like those you cite, have proved themselves. </p> <p>The key issue is the extent of the necessary body of understanding that has to be mastered. This is the difference between training to be a surgeon and a butcher. In the case of the former it is substantial, and hence a degree. Universities are rather good at developing and passing on theory. Even when there is no real need, they may still invent it. Practical learning can then become inflated with pseudo-knowledge. That seems to me to be the fundamental flaw at the heart of the new vocationalism. </p> <p>Best wishes, </p> <p>Alan (Smithers) </p> <p><b> Dear Alan,</b><br> </p> <p> Thanks for the translation and for accepting that vocational degrees like business and engineering have now proved themselves and rightly sit alongside medicine and law as valuable degrees. I will certainly not try to claim that every single degree which has recently been developed will similarly prove itself but if there is an extensive body of knowledge, valid underlying theory and a real need for its application, previous experience suggests that many will do so, even if they have to face the same challenges which science, business and engineering have overcome in the past. </p> <p>For example, like many universities, we have a degree course in retail management. We offer degree level business education with a specialism in a key business sector. In time, such degrees may even help some people to stop denigrating \"sales\" - but I recognise that this may take a some time. </p> <p>Best wishes, </p> <p>Alan (Roff) </p> <p><b> Dear Alan,</b><br> </p> <p> Although we can easily agree that some of the vocational education in universities is good and some poor, I suspect we differ profoundly on the current state of higher education. </p> <p>In my view, it has lost its way. Required in the mid-80s to double numbers on per capita funding cut by nearly half, it has struggled to devise inexpensive courses with which the new students could cope. It came up with confections of vocational and academic studies as the new degrees. Ironically, these drew from shorter, more focused training in further education and industry, which was of genuine benefit. </p> <p>Hard to explain in educational terms, this makes sense in a wider context. The government of the time was faced with a crisis. There were not enough jobs to go round and it judged this to be a threat to social cohesion. It badly needed something that young people would volunteer to do, and they would go to university. </p> <p>Much vocational education in universities is a waste of time because that is its role - a means of occupying young people who would otherwise be making a nuisance of themselves. </p> <p>Best wishes, </p> <p>Alan (Smithers) </p> <p><b> Dear Alan,</b><br> </p> <p> I'll have to rush. Since the A-level results came out, we've been overwhelmed with callers. We've had a 50% increase in UCAS applications this year, affecting old and new courses alike. I expect it's because of all the excellent ratings we've had from the Quality Assurance Agency, the very high employment rate of our graduates or just the student grapevine giving us a good press. </p> <p>You're right that we disagree about the current state of higher education. Most other developed countries had a third of their young people going into higher education years before the UK. It is obviously nonsense to suggest that our young people should be denied the opportunities they deserve or that our economy does not need the sort of graduates the universities are producing. Why else would graduate unemployment rates be so low and getting lower? </p> <p>From your letters, you sound fairly down. Have you thought about a complete change of lifestyle? Our BSc in multimedia system design may be a bit too modern for you, but I'm sure we could find you something. Most courses run in Preston but we've got a campus in Cumbria if you want to get away from urban life. Call soon or we'll be full. </p> <p>Must go now, </p> <p>Alan (Roff)</p>",
  "<p>Five British companies won the right to internet domain names that claimed they \"sucked\" yesterday, in a case that delivers a blow to anyone hoping to cash in on website registration. </p> <p>The World Intellectual Property Organisation, Wipo, ruled in Geneva that websites called natwestsucks.com, standardcharteredsucks.com, directlinesucks.com, dixonssucks.com and freeservesucks.com should all be owned by the companies concerned. </p> <p>NatWest, Standard Chartered and Direct Line, three financial services groups, the electrical retailer Dixon's, and the internet service provider Freeserve filed their complaint two months ago to the United Nations' arbitration panel after Purge IT, a British company, had registered the sucks.com domain names. </p> <p>Disputes involving some of the thousands of so-called cybergriping sites have escalated in the past year as companies have decided to stop turning a blind eye to what they consider blackmail. </p> <p>In a separate case yesterday, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, won control over wal-mart-europe.com from a resident of Geneva. In May, Wipo handed the Wal-mart several sucks.com domain names. </p> <p>So far this year, Wipo has accepted 954 domain name disputes for arbitration, although not all of these relate to corporate insults. The UN body introduced a new arbitration procedure last year to cut down on so-called \"cybersquatting\" amid complaints from corporations that it cost too much to buy back the rights to their names. </p> <p>In yesterday's ruling, William Cornish, the arbitrator, said that Purge, which is based in Bicester, had no legitimate interest in the names and had registered them in bad faith. He had heard evidence in the case that Purge had asked the companies concerned for money. He found the company had bought the domain names solely to sell them on rather than protest about the targeted companies. </p> <p>Purge argued that it had never used the domain names and had never intended to sell them to anyone but the companies involved. </p> <p>A spokesman for Freeserve said yesterday that it would not complain about legitimate protest, but added:\"The company acts in every way it can to protect its trademark and its brand. It is unacceptable for people to use our name in vain.\"</p>",
  "Two images stand out from the protests taking place outside the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles this week. The first was of battalions of riot police, equipped as if for an invasion, standing guard outside the downtown temples of corporate America as demonstrators marched past. The second was of the mainly Latino workers in the Broadway sweatshops leaning out of windows to cheer on the marchers protesting against \"corporate greed\" and globalisation. <p>The images symbolise both what is missing from conventional American politics, what divides the haves and have-nots of the world's richest country and what is fuelling the still unspecific but growing international movement that started in Seattle last year and will be seeking another platform in Prague next month. </p> <p>Only half of the American electorate vote for the president and the events of the past week in LA have partly served to explain why. The financial clout of the corporations now gives the appearance of having permeated every aspect of policy-making so that it is no longer clear to many people whether their elected representatives are acting in the voters' interests or their backers' interests. </p> <p>Do politicians shy away from real gun reform because of the gun manufacturers' lobby? Do they back a judicial system that jails more than 2m Americans because the prison-industrial complex now carries such weight? Are they helping the Colombian government in a civil war because they want to protect the interests of American oil and because it suits the military-industrial complex? For many politicians the answer may be no, but the suspicion will remain as long as the race is to the richest. The news this week that George W Bush had now raised $100m for his campaign and his running mate, Dick Cheney, had received a corporate pay-off of $20m further emphasised the great gulf between those inside the safe convention walls and those outside on the streets. And it is this gut feeling that the corporations and the international financial bodies are now controlling decisions on wages, the environment or immigration, that has helped to mobilise this still loosely-knit confederation of protest. </p> <p>What fuels it, too, in the United States, is the feeling that neither of the two main parties offer alternatives on what are to some people the most important issues of the day. One of the angriest demonstrations of the week focused on those on death row and in jail for drugs offences. Both Democrats and Republicans back the death penalty and both support the \"war on drugs\" that has led to the incarceration of so many. Indeed one of Al Gore's pledges during his acceptance speech was for a further 50,000 police officers. Not a further 50,000 teachers for a country with the illiteracy levels similar to those of many third world countries; not a further 50,000 medical workers for a country where 40m are not entitled to healthcare. No wonder some of the placards outside carried the slogan: \"Don't incarcerate, educate\". </p> <p>The ghost at the feast this week has been Ralph Nader, the Green party's candidate and now the repository of the hopes of the liberal left outside the Democratic party. His name was written in the heavens by a sky-writing plane on Wednesday and has been on the lips of many throughout the week. Is a vote for Nader a vote for Bush is the question that will be asked many times between now and November, but increasingly the evidence is that the uncommitted, the independents and the disillusioned Democrats will be heading his way. If these votes do indeed lose Gore the election, the next big question will be whether it leads to a larger, more focused movement and whether the Greens are the party best equipped to lead it. </p> <p>Al Gore and George W Bush may bask in the warm glow of their respective conventions, but outside the air-conditioned halls it is clear that the old order is no longer trusted by the very people - the young, the poor, the Latinos, the blacks - they are claiming to want to help. Somehow, it seems unlikely that many hands would be waving from sweatshop windows if either of the two presidential parties had ventured down Broadway in their limos this week. </p> <p> duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</p>",
  "Indonesia's disgraced army could be granted an amnesty for human rights abuses in East Timor after a last-minute amendment to the country's constitution. <p>The amendment appeared to contradict President Abdurrahman Wahid's assurances to the UN that Indonesia would conduct its own investigation into massacres in East Timor, and that an international war crimes tribunal was not necessary. </p> <p>The controversial change was introduced on the final afternoon of the annual session of the country's supreme legislative body, the people's consultative assembly (MPR). Some legislators tried to reassure critics that it would exclude major human rights abuses. </p> <p>The MPR also voted unanimously to allow the military to retain its formal role in government for a further five years after the next election, taking it to 2009. </p> <p>Analysts said the moves indicated a reluctance to offend the armed forces, which are still powerful. There has been speculation that the army might stage a coup if it were forced from the political scene. </p> <p>Indonesia's constitution will now say that military personnel cannot be prosecuted for crimes committed before the enactment of the legislation used to prosecute them. A decree to enable Indonesia to investigate the atrocities was cancelled in February, even though a law aimed at creating a special court to deal with past human rights violations by the security forces had yet to be enacted. </p> <p>The constitutional amendment could affect the investigation of military abuses all over the archipelago, from Aceh to West Papua, but will have most immediate relevance to events in East Timor. </p> <p>Hundreds of East Timorese were murdered by Indonesia's military-backed militias before and after the territory voted for independence last year, and hundreds of thousands more were forcibly evacuated to neighbouring West Timor. Soldiers and militiamen destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. </p> <p>Political analyst Kusnanto Anggoro said of the amendment: \"This shows that the military is still a powerful force to be reckoned with.\" </p> <p>But a senior MPR legislator, Jacob Tobing, indicated that it might still be possible to prosecute the dozen generals allegedly responsible for the East Timor abuses. He said that the amendment would probably not apply to \"special crimes\" such as genocide, war crimes and terrorism. </p> <p>One western diplomat said: \"It is all very vague. What is more worrying is that the investigation is proceeding without any formal legal basis so the defence lawyers will be able to announce a very strong case to have any charges thrown out.\" </p> <p>In East Timor, the vast majority of people say those responsible must be tried. What's more, they say the trials should take place in an international tribunal because they do not have confidence in Indonesia's notoriously corrupt legal system. </p> <p>\"The location of the tribunal is not important as long as it's not in Indonesia or under Indonesian law,\" said Aniceto Lopes of the East Timor Human Rights Foundation. </p> <p>A UN spokeswoman said yesterday that the MPR decision would have to be studied more closely before she would comment on whether the international community would now push for an international tribunal. </p> <p>Many UN sources in East Timor say that the international community has little appetite for organising prosecutions because they would be extremely expensive and would risk further destabilising Indonesia. </p> <p>This sentiment is reflected in a UN proposal to cut by almost half the number of international investigators looking into last year's atrocities. </p> <p>Senior UN officials and East Timorese political leaders such as Jose \"Xanana\" Gusmao are also advocating reconciliation rather than justice. </p> <p>But their calls are mostly falling on deaf ears. \"We endured 25 years of hell under Indonesian occupation,\" said Augusto da Silva, a farmer. \"Not only do we want justice, but we need justice in order to put the past behind us and move on.\"</p>",
  "<p>Optical chip specialist <strong> Bookham Technology</strong> topped the FTSE 100 performance table yesterday enlivened by fresh takeover speculation. </p> <p>Canadian group Nortel Networks was the name in the frame, with dealers mentioning an \u00a385-a-share takeout price that would value the Oxford company at a breathtaking \u00a310bn. </p> <p>Analysts did not dismiss the speculation but noted that turnover was lowish and it was silly season for takeover stories. Dealers, meanwhile, said the shares were due a bounce and that chip stocks were also strong in the US. </p> <p>Nortel, which accounts for more than half of Bookham's revenues, would want Bookham for its technology that makes it easier to manufacture the optical chips used in fibre optic networks. </p> <p>Nortel has been active in snapping up companies with proprietary technology for its own use. It has acquired a number that, like Bookham, are low on revenue but high on potential. It acquired two optical switching operations - Qtera and Xros - that had no sales at all. </p> <p>Bookham shares ended 640p higher at \u00a339.60. </p> <p>A late spurt saw the FTSE 100 index end 25.5 points better at 6,543.7 - its highest close in 11 weeks - thanks to continued strength in <strong> BP</strong>, up 5p at 629.5p, and good performances from <strong> HSBC</strong>, 8.5p higher at 946, and <strong> British Telecom.</strong> </p> <p> BT finished 25p stronger at 837p, lifted by positive comment on Thursday's deal to take control of German telecoms group Viag Interkom. Its shares did touch 844p early in the session after a report that claimed BT had discussed the prospect of a formal merger with US joint venture partner AT&amp;T. </p> <p>But City analysts were concentrating on fundamentals. Most reckon the stock is incredibly cheap and Viag represents a transformational step for BT. Even the debt implications of the Viag deal, which sent BT shares to a 20-month low on Thursday, were played down. According to Mike Williams at Deutsche Bank, the deal will not crystallise until the first half of next year, allowing BT to defer the cash outflow in the meantime initiating disposals and spin-offs. </p> <p>On the flip side, <strong> Vodafone</strong> eased 2p to 268p, despite upbeat recommendations from City analysts. With the end of the German third generation mobile phone licence auction, they reckon investors will start to look once more at the mobile data opportunity. </p> <p> <strong> Allied Domecq</strong> fell 1.25p to 325p amid concern that it will lose out in the battle for control of the world's third largest wines and spirits business. </p> <p>These fears intensified yesterday, as it rival, <strong> Diageo</strong>, off 11p to 600p, announced its intention to bid for the wines and spirits division of Canadian group Seagram with French group Pernod Ricard. According to analysts, Allied Domecq must acquire the Seagram business if it is to compete with Diageo on a global scale. </p> <p> <strong> Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> declined 21p to \u00a313.34 hit by a flurry of profit taking. Securities house Commerzbank spoke for many when it said the 30% appreciation in Royal Bank's share price since interim results earlier this month had been overdone. Commerzbank has lowered its rating on the stock to \"hold\". </p> <p>The FTSE 250 finished 33.6 points stronger at 6,913.2 - a closing high. Internet auction house <strong> QXL.com</strong> was 0.75p higher at 59.75p, the market unimpressed with the revised terms of the Ricardo.de acquisition. </p> <p>Among smaller companies, brewer <strong> Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley</strong> lost 25.5p to 457p after it rejected an offer from venture capital outfit Botts &amp; Company. W&amp;D feels the offer undervalues the company. </p> <p>Elsewhere, engineering group <strong> L. Gardner</strong> slid 43p to 185p as it warned on profits. A similar problem was behind the decline in <strong> Character Group</strong>, which moved 15p lower to 61.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Diageo and Pernod Ricard wrong-footed the rest of the spirits industry yesterday by announcing that they are to team up to make a joint offer for Seagram's $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) international drinks portfolio. </p> <p>The surprise combination was immediately taken as the favourite to win the auction, causing panic selling during the morning in the shares of rival bidder Allied Domecq. </p> <p>Diageo, the world's biggest drinks group, had been negotiating a joint bid with Bacardi, the Bermuda-based group best known for its rum. Talks collapsed earlier this week and the company began secret discussions with Paris-based Pernod. </p> <p>Pernod's joint-managing director, Richard Burrows, said: \"This is a unique opportunity within the wines and spirits industry - it is unusual for a business of the importance of Seagram to come on to the market.\" </p> <p>Mr Burrows said that Pernod was particularly interested in acquiring Seagram's Scotch whisky brands - which include Chivas Regal and The Glenlivet. The French group already owns a selection of middle-ranking brands, including Aberlour and Clan Campbell and the Irish whiskey, Jameson. </p> <p>Industry experts reckon that Pernod would take on the majority of Seagram's brands, with Diageo picking up the American group's Crown Royal whisky, Captain Morgan rum and various wines for around $1.5bn. </p> <p>Analyst Philip Hawkins of Merrill Lynch said: \"It's a marvellous combination - they can probably afford to pay more than anyone else.\" </p> <p>Seagram's wines and spirits portfolio is the third biggest in the industry. Allied Domecq, which ranks second, is anxious for a deal in order to close the gap with Diageo. </p> <p>Allied's shares plunged 8% yesterday morning on fears that the extra competition may tempt the company to overpay, although the price later recovered to close down 4p to 322p. </p> <p>Advisers to Allied rejected suggestions that the company could be squeezed out of the race. One said: \"Alliances are always weaker than single bidders.\" </p> <p>Allied maintains that it could raise enough money to make a $7bn cash bid for the business, while still having the cashflow to cover its interest payments three times over. </p> <p>A possible third bid could come from the Bronfman family, which founded Seagram. The Bronfmans are understood to be reluctant to lose control of the drinks business. </p> <p>Sources close to the transaction said that Seagram's adviser, Morgan Stanley, was likely to publish an information memorandum within the next week giving details of the businesses for sale. Seagram is refocusing on the entertainments industry - it is about to merge with the French group, Vivendi. </p> <p>Diageo and Pernod are likely to escape close regulatory scrutiny if their bid is successful. Some brands could fall through the net - it is understood that neither side is keen to take on Martell cognac. </p> <p>Members of Pernod's controlling family have made it clear that they would be prepared to dilute their control of the business if this was necessary to secure a substantial deal. </p> <p>Mr Burrows said: \"Scale is important. It is no secret that we want to expand. The creation of Diageo was a spur for everybody to look for more size in this industry.\"</p>",
  "There will be plenty of Americans wondering this weekend why on earth their political parties still bother hosting conventions. Every four years US commentators lament the lack of debate, the absence of tension, which makes these stage-managed gabfests such an apparent waste of time. Yet every four years the same commentators return, in ever larger numbers, to observe every detail. Is it all in vain? Well, not quite. For conventions still serve two useful purposes. First, they provide an insight into the state of the parties which hold them. Second, they often give a presidential candidate a vital dose of \"bounce\" in the opinion polls before campaigning gets underway in earnest in September. Judged by those standards, how did the Democrats do this week in Los Angeles? <p>The first measure does not yield good news. Two weeks ago the Republicans staged a near-model convention. They presented a public face utterly at odds with the mean-spirited, harsh image the party acquired in the age of Newt Gingrich. Instead of white men in suits, they presented an on-stage gala of blacks and Hispanics, gays and single moms: all wordlessly reinforcing George W Bush's message of \"compassionate conservatism\". Sure, it was fake - but it worked. Mr Bush left Philadelphia with a poll lead close to 20 points. </p> <p>The aim of the Republicans' cuddly new image was to reach out to non-committed voters in the centre. That's what the Democrats needed to do in LA, too. Instead they spent most of the week talking to themselves, shoring up their own liberal base by wheeling out old favourites like Ted Kennedy and Jesse Jackson. They had to because Democratic activists arrived in LA still distinctly lukewarm towards their candidate, Al Gore. They needed to be revved up. But it is a sure sign of weakness if a party has still not mobilised its own troops by the time it meets for a convention. </p> <p>Still, if Los Angeles shed some unflattering light on the Democrats, what did it do for Mr Gore? On the positive side, it confirmed that he is a man of substance. His acceptance speech on Thursday night was unashamedly focused on the issues. He boasted of the prosperity which has flowered under the Clinton-Gore administration and explained how he would use it on health and education, while his opponent would squander it with \"a huge tax cut for the wealthy\". He said he was on the side of working families, while Mr Bush would be the poodle of powerful corporate interests. And he staked out progressive stances on social questions like the environment, abortion, gun control and the overweening influence of cash in American politics. </p> <p>It all added up to a decent programme, one usefully distinct from Mr Bush's - which is clearly how Mr Gore wants to be judged. \"The presidency is more than a popularity contest,\" he said, tacitly acknowledging the charisma advantage his opponent enjoys over him. This may be his best hope: to admit that, as he put it, he will never be \"the most exciting politician\" - and then to define the contest as a clash of rival plans for the country. That, Mr Gore believes, is a fight he can win. The cruel question now is whether he is right. Can a politician who cannot deliver a speech without treading on his own applause lines beat an opponent with real charm? Can a man so wooden, he makes a kiss with his own wife look excruciating seduce a nation? Even if America agrees with Mr Gore on the issues, will that be enough to make them vote for him? In November Americans will decide what matters more: style or substance. After this week, that choice is clear.</p>",
  "The legal rules which allow unscrupulous house sellers to \"gazump\" their buyers are something that dodgy landlords seem to increasingly believe they can also take advantage of. <p>Ian Leatherman found this out to his cost after seeing a flat advertised in a Southampton local paper. He and his girlfriend viewed it the same evening, liked it, and agreed with the landlord that they would take it at the advertised rent of \u00a3125 per week from the beginning of the following month. </p> <p>The landlord asked them for a deposit of \u00a3250, which they paid in cash, and gave them a note saying that he had received a \u00a3250 \"holding deposit\". They were to pick the keys up and pay the first month's rent on the day the tenancy was due to start. </p> <p>However, when they called to collect the keys, he told them he had let the flat to someone else who had offered to pay \u00a3135 per week. The landlord told them he was sorry but \"as nothing had been signed I was enti tled to do that\". He claimed to have tried to phone to tell them this. They didn't believe him, but felt they had no choice other than to sim ply take their \u00a3250 back. Fortunately, they could stay in their old flat and so their only real loss was the wasted cost of hiring a van for the day. </p> <p>Had they decided to pursue the matter, a court would probably have awarded them damages and, if they had acted quickly enough, ordered the landlord to let them into the flat. </p> <p>The Law of Property Act (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1989, which requires property transactions to be in writing, does not apply to tenancies unless they are to last for longer than three years. Here, as both sides had committed themselves orally, with the receipt helping to prove it, the courts would treat it as a binding contract to grant a tenancy, which would allow Mr Leatherman and his girlfriend to occupy the flat for at least six months. </p> <p>The landlord could be ordered to pay them the \u00a310 a week extra rent he received by letting it to someone else for that six-month period, as well as the \u00a345 it cost to hire the van and a small sum for inconvenience. </p> <p>Even so, the damages would not be much over \u00a3500, and quite sensibly they decided it was not worth taking any action. Had they not been able to return to their flat and had had to move into expensive temporary accommodation the loss would have been much greater. </p> <p>The fact that the sum they paid was described as a \"holding deposit\" makes little difference. The expression suggests that the tenant has paid a sum in consideration for the landlord agreeing to keep the property available. It isn't unreasonable, then, if the tenant doesn't take the property and the landlord has turned away other people who wanted it, for the deposit to be lost. </p> <p>But it is obviously unfair if the landlord is not put under any obligation by accepting the deposit. However, some letting agencies are trying to enable landlords to do just this. More carefully worded receipts than that Mr Leatherman got are used when deposits are taken so landlords can still offer the property to someone willing to pay more. </p> <p>One agency makes the tenant handing over the deposit sign a form saying: \"This deposit does not create a tenancy, and does not require the landlord to grant one. It is merely an indication by the tenant of his or her good faith, and if he or she is subsequently offered a tenancy it will be retained by the landlord regardless of whether or not the tenancy is accepted.\" </p> <p>Words such as these do have the effect that there is not a binding tenancy, unless the landlord subsequently grants one. But if a tenancy is offered and the tenant decides not to take it, they are probably entitled to the deposit back. </p> <p>The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 say that clauses which allow the retention of money in this situation, where the party keeping the money has not put himself under any obligation, are unfair and hence usually void. </p> <p>Tenants faced with an established agency using this type of dubious device are likely to find the threat of legal proceedings quickly brings them the remedy they are seeking. Few will want terms of this sort subject to the scrutiny of a court. </p> <p> Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "One day the phone rang and someone said: \"How do you fancy counting arms in Russia?\" Straightaway I said, \"Yup, that sounds great.\" <p>As job offers go, it wouldn't be to everyone's taste, but to Lieutenant Commander Alison \"Aji\" Buchanan, it was a golden opportunity. After 14 years in the Royal Navy she had two years left to serve and hoped to finish with something \"a bit different\". </p> <p>Her new position at the Joint Arms Control Implementation Group (JACIG) - the Ministry of Defence body responsible for implementing arms treaties between former Warsaw Pact countries and Nato - saw her appointed second-in-command of her team, unheard-of seniority for a woman. </p> <p>Last month she was nominated in the professional category for a European Women of Achievement award. \"I felt humbled by nominees like the woman who single-handedly started orphanages in Romania. I thought: \"Gosh, you just inspect weapons as part of a well-trained team.\" Her modesty belies the rigorous demands of her work; in the last two years she has done around 20 trips to Warsaw Pact countries. \"Much of our brief is to check data,\" she explains, \"So if Romania say they have x number of tanks we go out and count them. Glamorous it isn't: when you're trudging around in the mud and snow with a clipboard, trying to work out what tank is what, you do wonder what you're doing.\" </p> <p>Sheer poverty can make certain countries hazardous. \"Once in Moldova [the former Soviet state] I travelled by helicopter with six pilots who had to get in their year's flying time - they hadn't flown for months. The fuel tank was leaking and there was a chap smoking a cigarette. Sure, I was glad to get back.\" </p> <p>She has been moved by the poverty of nations once considered a threat. \"We go there and realise how lucky we are to have such excellent military resources. But I wonder what they think when they come here.\" </p> <p>This state of affairs - whereby formerly secretive enemies now get to see exactly what their opposite numbers are up to - is central to modern-day arms control. \"As well as physically verifying weapons, we also undertake 'confidence and security-building measures', where we meet soldiers and visit training areas; then they come and visit us,\" she explains. \"It's the antithesis of our Cold War relationships; now it's about breaking down barriers, not building them.\" </p> <p>It is this which attracted her to arms control in the first place. \"With JACIG, you go out and do it for real. It's not an exercise, it's actually about preventing war. I love that.\" But what if there are no tanks where tanks should be - or too many? \"There's rarely a serious problem,\" she says. \"Occasionally we'll want to see something or go somewhere and they'll argue the treaty doesn't cover that. If they won't let us, we make a comment in our report.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, the Lieutenant Commander undertook her biggest responsibility, seconded to Sarajevo as part of an international team. \"We were there to support arms control among the three groups - Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs - who live in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We were mediating requests for inspections between different parties and the decision-makers in Vienna.\" </p> <p>The job called for all her diplomatic skills but she thrived on the challenge. \"It's a beautiful, tattered city. I enjoyed buying my fresh vegetables from the market and getting to know local people. But it was chastening to see the devastation of a post-war city.\" She felt quite safe. \"Several war criminals were picked up while I was there so perhaps I should have worried more.\" </p> <p>Her career has been affected by a traditional division of labour: \"It was great to get this job at the end, as it would have been hard to compete for seniority with men for naval posts. When I joined the navy, women weren't allowed to go to sea. That changed in the early 90s and I joined HMS Fearless. I did well to be promoted to Lieutenant Commander at 34, but I was always going to be seven years behind the men in terms of seagoing experience.\" </p> <p>In December 2001, - after two months secondment in Zagreb - she hits civvy street. \"I don't know what I'm going to do but I reckon I've got something to offer.\" After dodgy helicopters and Balkan diplomacy, she should find it plain sailing.</p>",

The only parameter that has changed dramatically is the speed with which these companies have to innovate. </p> <p>Our experience over 30 years has given Bain &amp; Co yardsticks by which to measure success. Any operation, dot.com or otherwise, has to build a sustainable, profitable business that gains a significant market share. There are three measures of success in the e25 index. First, you need a a clever idea that makes the business sustainable. So, Sportingbet.com spotted the tax advantage of offshore bookmaking early and based itself in Alderney, where punters could gamble tax-free. That launched its brand into places where its big-name competitors in the UK had no market share. The current e25 number one, auctioneer QXL, developed technology to hold live internet auctions and so attract business away from me-too sites. </p> <p>Second, the business needs smart managers. Innovation in e-commerce can't be done by a committee. Dot-com managers need to retain control, establish a clear direction and communicate it. Many of the e25's founders are handing over day-to-day running of the company to experienced business people. </p> <p>Finally, you need money. Recent experiences of several high-profile dot-com companies show that without money, a bright idea and good management are useless. For consumer-focused start-ups, the cost of acquiring each new customer has quadrupled to \u00a380. Nine out of 10 internet companies are undercapitalised. The money will be gone before there are profits to replace it. </p> <p>QXL is a good example of a company that used its market capitalisation to expand overseas, buying Bidlet in Sweden and ricardo in Germany. Its success means it is able to buy quality and expand quickly to market-leadership in 11 countries. </p> <p>To compile the e25, we took these principles and scored candidates in six categories: concept, innovation, execution, traffic, financing and profile. The final figure is a mark out of 100. Among the 50 or so top candidates there's not much in it - between 5th and 15th, the difference is only 5%. </p> <p>The direction in which you are heading in the index is as important as your place in it. Branding is vital - and for companies whose brand becomes tarnished, like boo.com, a slide can be very hard to reverse. The e25 will create a record of who did what, and whether it worked. It will also be able to tell us which companies will be working in the future, too. </p> <p> The annual update of the e25 will be published in next month's issue of Management Today.</p>",
  "If taking tea with the Queen Mum or discussing form with Frankie Dettori sounds a pleasant way of spending a summer's afternoon, why not join the growing number of people who have become racehorse owners? <p>Buying a horse outright may be a little adventurous. Even a modest purchase is likely to set you back \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000, plus as much again each year on stable and training fees. </p> <p>With no guarantee of any return whatsoever, joining a racing club or syndicate is a way to achieve ownership while keeping costs and risks under control. Perhaps the first thing to decide is if you want a jumper or a horse for the flat season. </p> <p>The flat season runs from March to November and with the advent of summer jumping, hurdlers are now busy all year round. It's worth bearing in mind that, generally, prize money for jumpers is less than for flat racing. Syndicates come in sizes to suit all pockets. </p> <p>Cheltenham Racing Ltd, which is linked to Cheltenham racecourse, has been running an owners' club since 1993. For \u00a3230 annual membership plus a \u00a325 joining fee, you get a club badge, car park label, and use of the marquees at the National Hunt Festival. You also get free admission to the course when your horse is running and eight stable visits a year. Currently, the syndicate runs four National Hunt horses with a restricted membership of 250 people. </p> <p>If you have more to spend, Delta Bloodstock Management, based in Newmarket, has a syndicate of 20 people with shares starting at \u00a33,000. This covers all equity, training and management fees for a year. The syndicate is currently running seven flat horses. </p> <p>Partnerships can be formed with as few as two or four people. The cost of the horse is paid for up front and a variable amount paid each month for the training and running fees. Partners have to register with the Jockey Club and are also liable for occasional running expenses such as veterinary and blacksmiths' fees. </p> <p>Partners can name their horse and choose the colours in which they will run. The services of a good bloodstock agent or trainer are essential in buying the animal. The two big auction houses, Tattersalls and Doncaster Blood Sales, each have several public auctions during the year where a range of animals from foals, yearlings and two-year-olds will be available. In 1999 the average price paid for a yearling at public auction was \u00a330,450 and for a two-year-old in training \u00a313,000. </p> <p>Choosing a trainer is almost as difficult as choosing a horse. Some owners like to visit their animals often and follow them from meet to meet; others are quite happy to let the trainer make the decisions. The British Horseracing Board's website gives brief details of trainers such as how many winners, how many horses in their yard and their philosophy towards owners. </p> <p>James Bethall, who runs a number of syndicates from his yard at Leyburn in north Yorkshire, advocates owner involvement. \"They are most welcome to come to the stables and watch us gallop the horses. I regard every horse as an investment into which I put my knowledge and expertise.\" </p> <p>The board also runs a twice-yearly owner seminar to give prospective buyers an overview of what horse ownership is all about. The semi nars are held at Epsom in April and Newmarket in September and last two days. The subject matter covers essentials about setting up and running a partnership, the role of the bloodstock agent and how to choose a trainer. </p> <p>They cost \u00a3225 plus VAT per delegate, but if you become a registered owner within 12 months you will be entitled to a full refund of the fee plus a year's free membership of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association, worth \u00a375, and a year's free membership of the Racehorse Owners Association, worth \u00a380. </p> <p>And the rewards? It may not be the place to put your pension, but if you buy a winner, it could well provide a pension. Earth Summit, owned by the Summit Partnership and winner of the 1998 Grand National, cost the miserly sum of \u00a36,090 and has so far won in excess of \u00a3373,000. Istabraq, the Champion Hurdler, which cost \u00a339,900, has notched up more than \u00a3847,000 and See More Business, the Tote Gold Cup winner bought for \u00a35,880, has passed the \u00a3400,000 mark. </p> <p>This year alone the estimated prize fund at Britain's 59 racecourses is expected to exceed \u00a370m, ranging from a guaranteed \u00a3160 appearance fee for all Sunday runners up to \u00a31m for the Derby. </p> <p> British Horse Racing Board, 0207-396-0011 <a href=\"http://www.bhb.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.bhb.co.uk</a>; The Jockey Club, 0207-486-4921 <a href=\"http://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thejockeyclub.co.uk</a>; Racehorse Owners Association, 0207-408-0903; National Trainers Federation, 01488-71719; Racecourse Association Ltd, 01344-625612 <a href=\"http://www.comeracing.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.comeracing.co.uk</a>; Cheltenham Racing Ltd, 01242-255682 <a href=\"http://www.cheltenham.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cheltenham.co.uk</a>; Delta Bloodstock Management, 01638-668065.</p>",
  "The most remarkable fact about the chief rail inspector's letter ('Safety at Risk' in Tube sell-Off, August 18) is that it was written at all. Notwithstanding the efforts and commitments of hundreds of field inspectors, the HSE has never adopted anything like a \"punitive\" approach to safety. HSE chiefs see the organisation's role as educating, advising, sometimes cajoling a little, rather than referring to companies' legal duties and actually enforcing health and safety law; companies are given a great deal - indeed, far too much - latitude in this area. So, when this mouse roars, even New Labour should sit up and listen. For the sake of safety - let alone cost and efficiency - even Prescott must now see that this is a privatisation too far. <p>Prof Steve Tombs, Liverpool John Moores University</p>",

  "<p>A new diabetes drug which could help thousands of people avoid the need for daily insulin injections should be made available on the NHS, the government body charged with assessing new medicines said today. </p> <p>But the ruling by the national institute for clinical excellence could cost the health service millions of pounds. </p> <p>A panel of experts from Nice concluded that the drug Avandia, made by SmithKline Beecham, should be offered to sufferers of type 2 diabetes, which affects around 800,000 people in England and Wales. </p> <p>But the medical and lay experts have recommended that it should be offered only to patients unable to take traditional combinations of older drugs or if those have not proved effective. </p> <p>Avandia is one of a new range of glucose-lowering drugs for diabetes which can be taken orally, rather than by injection. </p> <p>Diabetes sufferers complain that the need for daily injections of life-saving insulin means they face discrimination and driving restrictions, as well as the physical toll of administering the jabs. </p> <p>It is also thought that Avandia can give better protection against the damage to blood vessels which diabetes causes, and reduce the risk of heart and kidney disease, strokes, blindness and ulcers. </p> <p>Andrew Dillon, chief executive of Nice, said: \"This new guidance is an example of the way Nice intends to support and promote clinically and cost effective new medicines at the time they become available. Our guidance should ensure uniform take-up of rosiglitazone [the medical name for Avandia] throughout the NHS.\" </p> <p>Nice was set up last year to issue guidance on which new drugs and therapies should be available on the NHS in England and Wales, and end so-called postcode prescribing, where new treatments are available from some health authorities and not others. </p> <p>Experts make decisions based on the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of drugs and the government is expected to accept the latest guidance. </p> <p>But the body has made some controversial decisions, including a recommendation that the flu drug Relenza should not be prescribed on the NHS. There have been claims that this is \"rationing by the back door\". </p> <p>The junior health minister, Gisela Stuart, said: \"Today's guidance opens up options for treating some patients with diabetes. </p> <p>\"It is another step towards our goal of ensuring that people with diabetes have equal access to the best treatments wherever they live.\" </p> <p>Avandia has been available for a year in the US and is used by around a million diabetics. </p> <p>It costs \u00a3320-\u00a3640 a year per patient, depending on the individual dose. </p> <p>Suzanne Lucas, director of care at the charity Diabetes UK, said: \"It is vital that greater effort is made to prevent the long term complications of diabetes by keeping good control of blood glucose levels. </p> <p>\"Any treatment which promises to help this should be available to everyone that needs it. </p> <p>\"Avandia may well allow those who would otherwise be considered for insulin therapy to delay this, thus avoiding the difficulties and discrimination, such as driving restrictions, with which insulin therapy can be associated.\"</p>",
  "He has battled storm force winds, 20ft ocean swells and sharks, but when Jason Lewis spotted gunmen approaching his pedalo off the Solomon Islands he knew drastic action was needed. <p>He stripped off, stood up stark naked and waved wildly at the militiamen. They dropped their automatic weapons, turned their speedboat around and fled. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Lewis celebrated completing a near 7,000-mile pedal boat voyage from the United States to Australia. The 32-year-old from Bridport, Dorset, and 42-year-old teacher April Abril pedalled the 26ft craft into Port Douglas on the Queensland coast at 6am BST yesterday. </p> <p>\"We had a great reception on the final run in, with every boat which passed us shouting, waving, honking horns and lobbing beers at the boat,\" said Mr Lewis, who admitted he was having trouble walking because of salt water sores from being permanently wet. </p> <p>He made landfall with Ms Abril, from Rye, Colorado, who rejoined the \u00a326,000 wooden self-righting vessel, Moksha, for the last eight or nine miles of the 1,100 mile voyage from Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. She had been transferred off Moksha for a medical check-up after the craft was towed through the Great Barrier Reef to prevent it being smashed. </p> <p>With no charts for the area, the pair accepted an 11-mile tow through the treacherous reef following a hair-raising week of adverse tides, huge seas and 30 knot winds which blew the expedition 130 miles north of its target, Cairns. </p> <p>Speaking from Port Douglas, Mr Lewis, a musician, said: \"It is so great to be off the boat, but it is only just sinking in what has been achieved. </p> <p>\"It is a huge deal, we have just crossed the biggest ocean in the world by human power. Three or four days ago we faced a pretty serious situation and were getting blown on to the reef itself in 30 knot winds. </p> <p>\"During the last 10 days we were pedalling full bore southwards against the trade winds but we were slowly going backwards so we had to use a sea anchor, which is like a giant parachute, to check our drift.\" </p> <p>The voyage was part of Mr Lewis's 35,000-mile, human-powered circumnavigation of the world, which began in London six years ago. But the expedition is in desperate financial straits, and Mr Lewis said he hoped the Pacific crossing would generate sponsorship. </p> <p>Ms Abril, for whom the trip was her first sea voyage, said: \"I am really happy and excited to have had the chance to do it. It was such a test of perseverance to hang in there. I lost quite a bit of weight, but I never lost my desire to pedal.\" </p> <p>During the journey the pair had little chance of privacy, but working as a team, which included fighting off a marauding 14 ft shark which tried to eat their propeller, the pair overcame any shyness. </p> <p>Mr Lewis's journey began from Greenwich in July 1994, and he has travelled more than 20,000 miles in his vessel, which is equipped with a satellite phone, global positioning system and desalination plant. </p> <p>He started with Steve Smith, from Wolverhampton, who left to pursue other projects after helping to pedal the Moksha from San Francisco to Hawaii on the first 2,200-mile Pacific leg. </p> <p>Mr Lewis then went solo for the next leg - a 2,200 voyage to Tarawa, in the Kiribati Republic. </p> <p>He was joined for the 1,100-mile leg from Tarawa to the Solomon Islands by 34-year-old Chris Tipper, from Brighton, who built the Moksha but had never sailed it. Ms Abril, who had helped with the expedition's schools education programme, joined him for the final leg. </p> <p>Now he is in Australia, Mr Lewis plans to cycle and roller blade across the country before heading back towards Europe across Asia - another three or four years and 15,000 miles of travelling before he returns to Greenwich. </p> <p>Describing a cramped and cold life on the ocean waves, eating mainly porridge, supplemented by M&amp;Ms and Mars Bars, Mr Lewis said the pedalo offered little shelter from the elements. The only moments of comfort were during the gruelling 12 hour pedalling shifts. Because they were permanently damp, with waves constantly drenching their sleeping bags, pedalling was the only way to keep warm. And Ms Abril suffered sea sickness.</p>",
  "Japan's conservative ruling party is being shaken up by a \"brat pack\" of impatient young MPs who are threatening to topple the prime minister Yoshiro Mori. <p>About 50 Liberal Democratic party MPs elected in the past decade have formed a new group to mount a rare generation-based challenge to the country's ageing leadership. </p> <p>Headed by the sons and daughters of some of Japan's most powerful leaders, they are pushing for economic reform and an end to the wasteful pork-barrel spending that has left the country with the biggest national debt in world history. </p> <p>In a campaign for greater democracy in the LDP, they are preparing to put forward a candidate to stand against Mr Mori as head of the LDP. </p> <p>\"The ruling party has failed to keep up with the rapidly changing times and the shift in voter preferences,\" said Yoshimi Watanabe, one of the founders of the Group to Build a New LDP. \"The quickest way to improve the situation would be to get rid of Mr Mori.\" </p> <p>This outspoken criticism of one's own party is unusual in Japanese politics, which has long been defined by the Confucian values of group loyalty and respect for seniority. </p> <p>But the new group represents a generation of young, mostly urban voters who have been frustrated by the slow pace of change in Japan, which they blame on the hidebound traditions and vested interests of the ruling gerontocracy. </p> <p>While reforms in the private sector have seen companies ditch the inefficient practice of promoting workers by age, the LDP continues to promote government ministers according to how many terms they have served in parliament. </p> <p>As a result, the average age of the current cabinet is 67, with two ministers more than 80 years old. Established less than two months ago, it already looks past its sell by date with ratings of just 20%. </p> <p>By contrast, the new group contains some of Japan's most popular, media-savvy and international-minded politicians such as Makiko Tanaka, the woman most Japanese would like as prime minister. </p> <p>Although the group is criticised as a collection of spoilt rich kids, its members have demonstrated their independence by openly rebuking their parents in parliament. Among the most vocal has been Taro Kono, who has lambasted his father, Yohei - the foreign minister - during committee sessions. </p> <p>\"Our impression of the younger Kono is that he is more like a member of the opposition than the LDP,\" confided one member of the bureaucracy, which is used to manipulating frail ruling party politicians. \"We cannot control him.\" </p> <p>The new group was formed in the wake of June's general elections, which saw the ruling party lose seats and votes, especially in urban areas. </p> <p>\"The result reflects city voters' loathing of the LDP,\" said Nobuteru Ishihara, the head of the new group and the son of Tokyo's governor. \"There is no tomorrow for the party unless this is recognised.\" </p> <p>Partly to appease the new group, the LDP abandoned a bailout plan for the Sogo department store, which led to the country's second biggest corporate collapse. Mr Mori has also agreed to carry out a review of public works projects. </p> <p>It is far from certain that the group can maintain its early momentum, given the mixture of views among its members and the pressures to conform inside the LDP. </p> <p>But among the electorate, expectations are high that the brat pack - which has begun reaching out to young MPs in opposition parties - can act as the catalyst for change. For now however the group is biding its time. </p> <p>\"People say I should leave the LDP or get rid of Mori,\" Mr Ishihara said. \"But my message is please be patient and watch what we do from now on.\" </p> <p><b>New breed of radical rattles the house</b></p> <p>Underlining the shift in values in Japan, the politician who has made one of the biggest splashes since June's election is a 32-year-old woman who has been married four times. </p> <p>Hiroko Mizushima, a psychiatrist turned opposition MP, has been the subject of intense media scrutiny since pulling off the shock of the elections by defeating one of the most powerful patriarchs in the ruling party. </p> <p>The attention is partly based on her impressive parliamentary debut, a grilling of prime minister Yoshiro Mori that he described as \"deeply moving\". </p> <p>But it is also because she represents a generation of Japanese whose values are so far removed from those of their conservative parents that they have been dubbed shinjinrui - a new breed of the human. </p> <p>As numerous magazine articles have pointed out, Ms Mizushima is radical both in her politics and her lifestyle. </p> <p>Far from the Confucian ideal of deference to her father - a ruling party MP - she chose to run for the op position Democratic party of Japan after seeing a newspaper advertisement for candidates. </p> <p>She is already refusing to toe the cautious line of her party's male leaders by recommending an alliance with the Communists and declaring that she wants the job of shadow education minister. </p> <p>But her most scathing criticism is reserved for the ruling gerontocracy. \"Elderly Japanese people are becoming unworthy of respect,\" she says. \"If they set a good moral example young people will follow them, but instead they lie and accept bribes.\" </p> <p>In protest against Japanese laws that forbid married couples from having separate surnames, she has divorced the same man three times and set up an internet site recommending others pursue the same strategy. </p> <p>How effective such shock tactics will be in Japan's consensus-driven political world is open to question. </p> <p>But Ms Mizushima says she is not trying to ram her ideas down people's throats, only to offer alternatives.</p>",

  "Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, said yesterday he believed the outbreak of swine fever on East Anglian farms had been contained but that final confirmation would not be received until tests on 31 farms still under investigation had been completed. <p>An optimistic Mr Brown met leaders of the pig industry yesterday and reassured them of extra government help if the outbreak continued. </p> <p>In Brussels, the European commission disclosed that the virus which caused the East Anglian outbreak was very similar to one carried by a wild boar illegally imported into continental Europe from Asia two years ago. </p> <p>Officials believe the contaminated boar may have passed the contagious disease on to a pig which was later imported into the UK with catastrophic consequences. </p> <p>EU experts working at a laboratory in Hanover made the connection after testing blood samples from infected East Anglian pigs. </p> <p>\"It's a new strain, but it is similar to the one that came from Asia. It could be a mutation but it's too early to tell,\" an EC spokeswoman, Andrea Dahmen, explained. </p> <p>The revelation will come as a relief to many farmers in the UK, since it had earlier been feared that the disease was the same virulent strain which swept through the Netherlands in 1997, spreading to Belgium and Germany. </p> <p>Millions of pounds were paid out in compensation during that outbreak and 14m pigs had to be slaughtered before the disease was brought under control. </p> <p>A panel of EU veterinary experts will meet in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss whether the Europe-wide ban on the export of English pigs should be extended or amended. </p> <p>Mr Brown said that by then extensive results should be available from all 31 farms under investigation and from another 100 farms which are under restrictions because of their proximity to the outbreaks or because of some link to them. </p> <p>Despite hundreds of tests over the last week no pig has tested positive since August 12, although there is still time for the disease to incubate in pigs which so far appear to be healthy. The government's chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said signs were \"encouraging.\" </p> <p>Only five farms have been confirmed with swine fever, Mr Scudamore said, with a further 31 premises reporting sick pigs, but none of the tests on these had so far provided a positive result. </p> <p>Mr Scudamore said: \"I am not going to commit myself on what is happening because it would be very unwise, but... the results seem to be encouraging.\" </p> <p>Farms in East Anglia, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Sussex, the Isle of Wight and Dorset have been banned from transporting pigs while tests are carried out. </p> <p>Mr Scudamore said \"Tuesday will be very early to get an all clear for England for swine fever, but if we can show we haven't got the disease spreading the vets might take a decision on whether the ban needs to cover England or a smaller area.\" For example, Yorkshire had no farms under investigation and that could be excluded from export restrictions. </p> <p>John Godfrey, chairman of the National Pig Association, said it was important that the EU's restrictions on pig exports were not allowed to cripple the industry in England. </p> <p>\"The priority is to control the disease... and the Ministry of Agriculture has done a superb job in identifying and making sure that the disease does not spread,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We now have to work out a system to see that those controls do not permanently financially damage quite a lot of pig farmers.

  "A plastic surgeon accused of bungling operations on dozens of patients has been suspended from the medical register while complaints against him are investigated. <p>David Herbert is the first doctor to be dealt with under new powers which enable the General Medical Council to impose interim bans. Previously the GMC could only impose suspensions in restricted circumstances, and some doctors continued practising for years while waiting for their cases to go before its professional conduct committee. </p> <p>Mr Herbert, 62, was working as a consultant at the private Cromwell clinic in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. In May, the Labour MP Ann Clwyd told the House of Commons he had left some patients scarred for life and one close to death. </p> <p>The GMC is investigating several complaints against the surgeon, who qualified in 1961.

  "A disease at the centre of germ warfare scares during the Gulf war has returned to a northern industrial city where it haunted textile workers in Victorian times. <p>The virulent bacterial infection anthrax, seldom encountered in Britain today, has struck down a factory worker in Bradford, where stringent measures were taken to prevent its spread during the heyday of the woollen industry. </p> <p>The man aged 35, who has not been named, is recovering in hospital after emergency treatment with antibiotics. Although anthrax cannot be passed on by person-to-person contact, all other workers at the plant have been alerted and informed of early symptoms of the disease, which is potentially fatal if not treated rapidly. </p> <p>The victim, the first in Bradford for at least 18 years, has cutaneous anthrax, the least serious of the disease's three forms but one in which seeping black ulcers develop on the body. He is thought to have become infected when his arm was cut at work, triggering public health alarm about possible contamination inside the factory. </p> <p>Staff from the health and safety executive and the city's environmental health department are checking the building for sources of anthrax spores, which are found in animal material such as elephant tusks (which led to the death of a London piano key maker in the 1940s) and hides used in textile production, especially goat fleeces, such as mohair, and alpaca. </p> <p>\"The other workers have been alerted as a precautionary measure,\" said Ruth Gelletlie, consultant in communicable disease control for Bradford health authority. \"They have been told to be aware of the possible symptoms of anthrax and to seek medical help if they are concerned, as prompt diagnosis and early treatment are important.\" </p> <p>Britain has seen only four anthrax cases since 1990, the last in 1995, but the disease came to prominence during the Gulf war because of rumours that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq planned use the most dangerous form - pulmonary anthrax, which ulcerates the lung lining into tatters - in missiles or attacks on water supplies. </p> <p>The particularly dark reputation of the infection also owes much to the former \"anthrax island\" of Gruinard, near Ullapool in Scotland, which was declared safe only in 1990 after being used for secret germ warfare tests with anthrax spores during the second world war. </p> <p>For most of the 19th and early 20th century, anthrax was known in Britain as woolsorter's disease, because of the heightened risk to men and women sorting hides and fleeces before woolcombing and spinning. </p> <p>Mohair and alpaca, in which Bradford led the world, were particularly dangerous.

People have taken to quoting him, not something that often happens nowadays. </p> <p>Alan Watkins, in the Independent on Sunday, unveiled this gobbet in the context of the demonstrations on the Paulsgrove estate: \"We have shown that crowds do not reason, that they accept or reject ideas as a whole, that they tolerate neither discussion nor contradiction, and that the suggestions brought to bear on them invade the entire field of their understanding and tend at once to transform themselves into acts.\" Mick Hume in the Times referred to Le Bon's contention that \"a man descends several rungs in the ladder\" when he joins a crowd. </p> <p>As I pondered these words, a trickle of questions started to seep like treacle through the ramshackle teashop which is my mind.</p> <p> 1.Where did this fellow spring from?</p> <p> 2. Had he the slightest idea what he was talking about?</p> <p> 3. Was he any relation of Simon and Yasmin? </p> <p>Here, in descending order of reliability, are some of the answers.</p> <p> 1. Gustav le Bon was born in Nogent-le-Notrou in 1841 and died in Marnes-la-Coquette (what a delightful name!) 90 years later.</p> <p> 2. His main scholarly interest was crowds, yielding books called The Crowd; The Crowd and Extraordinary Public Delusions; and The Psychology of Revolution. He was also a steaming racist, who regarded it as a proof of the emptiness of sociology that a rival scholar had dared to assert that black people (Le Bon used the word negroes) might be the equal of white. A note in Encyclopaedia Britannica refers to his strong anti-democratic bias. He attributed true progress, it says, to the work of an intellectual elite, believing the masses to be devoid of reason. Not a natural Guardian reader. He may also have fancied himself as a coiner of pithy apophthegms: at any rate, the Oxford Book of Aphorisms quotes a Gustave le Bon as saying in 1913: \"Virtuous people often revenge themselves for the constraints to which they submit by the boredom which they inspire.\" (I fear there is some truth in that observation.)</p> <p>3. I haven't the vaguest idea.</p> <p> <strong> The Marquis of Vauvenargues writes:</strong> I think you should note that this is the only aphorism of Gustave le Bon in the Oxford book. There are 52 of my own. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Rocket Surgeon of the Week</strong> - an occasional Smallweed series. Manchester United footballer Henning Berg on the club's plethora of defenders: \"I don't think you have to be a brain surgeon to see that I'm fifth or sixth choice\".</p> <p> \u0095 Here is something still more peculiar told to Smallweed this week, leaving him gawping. When TE Lawrence signed up for the RAF, under the pseudonym Shaw, the officer who interviewed him was WE Johns, creator of Biggles. What a clash of literary titans was there, my countrymen! Or not, as the case may be. </p> <p>\u0095 And now for Heartbreak House, Smallweed's riposte to the show that has seized the throat of the nation: Big Brother, about these oddballs living together and getting thrown out one by one. In my version, one new nominee is exiled to the house each week, to stay there for ever, I hope. This week's choice is between two ubiquitous Charlies. They are: </p> <p>1. Charlie Dimmock, who appears in gardening programmes plashing on about water features, though what she's really famous for is not wearing a bra.</p> <p> 2. Charlie Whelan, a professional mouth who used to nurture the interests of Gordon Brown and is now firing off almost everywhere.</p> <p>I wish I could ask my readers to vote on the choice but my budget does not run to it, so I'm forced to fall back on chance. Take the 27th word of the piece to the left of this column (the regular weekly debate) and note its opening letter. If it's an odd-numbered letter, like A C or E, Dimmock is doomed. If it's an even number, like B D or F, Whelan gets it. My show, by the way, is completely unscripted. Can the same be said of Big Brother? </p> <p> \u0095The other day, while my wife and I were at Loggerheads...</p> <p><strong> A pedant writes:</strong> I think you mean \"when my wife and I were at loggerheads\". </p> <p><strong> Smallweed brusquely retorts:</strong> I mean what I say. The other day, while my wife and I were at Loggerheads, a village near Market Drayton in Shropshire, a nun of forbidding demeanour waved us down, and producing a gun from her wimple... </p> <p> <strong>The Marquis of Vauvenargues writes: </strong> How Smallweed forgets his old friends! I thought we would have some reference this week to the proud achievements of table-topping Cowdenbeath, top of the Scottish third division, unbeaten all season and nary a goal thumped past their custodian. </p> <p><strong> A pedant writes: </strong> I think you owe it to readers to point out that this happy record reflects a mere two games played. </p> <p><strong> Smallweed retorts with a fury which makes bystanders flinch: </strong> Begone, you frightful old spoilsport. </p> <p> \u0095 After my blunder with Hounslow Heath I suppose it was inevitable that complaints would pour in about my reference to the Boat Inn, Jackford, Shropshire. A kindly scourge from Birmingham suggests that I must have drunk rather too much on the premises, since the place is called Jackfield. You are wrong, wrong, wrong, Mr Holyoak, and don't think you are going to be spared for sending your allegation on a postcard with a picture of Samuel Morse, he of the Code. I wrote Jackfield: some jackanapes corrected it. I hope very soon to make an arrest. Let me only discover someone in this building who thinks John Wayne's best movies were directed by John Field, that Frank Ford was charged by Tony Blair to think the unthinkable, and that Graham Thorpe fords in the England outford, and that will be it. He will pretty soon learn that he can't affield to mess with Smallweed.</p> <p>\u0095 In response to popular demand: <a href=\"mailto:smallweed@theguardian.com\">smallweed@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There is, I believe, a cunning plan by TV executives to reverse the decline in audiences. Not unlike the evil Syndicate from The X Files, they are a shadowy lot - maybe with names like the Well Manicured Man, the Cigarette-Smoking Man, the Man-Breasts Man - whose sole aim is to frighten the British public into never leaving home again. How else do you explain <strong> Destination Nightmare</strong> (BBC1), which told horror stories of holidays gone wrong? </p> <p>There was Kevin and Samantha, whose Bahamanian wedding was ruined by Hurricane Floyd; Peter, who got shot in a taxi in Bangkok; and Steven, who was trampled by an elephant in Botswana. They had all set out for a dreamy time and it had turned nightmarish. \"It was worse than Blackpool,\" Samantha's chum Suzanne noted. And before you think that is simply a lesson in avoiding destinations beginning with the letter B, John and Edna had a terrible time in the Seychelles, while in Interlaken a flash flood killed 21 people canyoning in a gorge. </p> <p>Of all the contributors, Kevin and Samantha and friends Robbie and Suzanne were the most hilarious. Not ones to let a terrifying weather phenomenon get in the way of their holiday videomaking, Kevin and Robbie wandered round the deserted beach in gale-force winds, camera in hand. Robbie was most excited: \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\" Sure is. Can't think of anything more once-in-a-lifetime than getting killed by a flying deckchair. And we wonder why foreigners think British folk are stupid. </p> <p>Destination Nightmare was a truly appalling programme, not because of the natural disasters, rogue animals and human incompetence that it depicted - although the story of a man whose bungee-jump rope was too long was pretty awful - but because it was a sprawling mess of voyeuristic sensationalism dressed up as a public-service broadcast. Its tone was uneven and crass, lurching from the Interlaken deaths to John and Edna's building-site fiasco with indecency not seen since That's Life moved from stories of child abuse to Doc Cox and potatoes resembling ladyparts. As if that weren't terrible enough, we got to see Nick Ross in skintight rubber, a delight normally reserved for the Crimewatch wrap party. </p> <p>Over on <strong> Brookside</strong> (Channel 4), meanwhile, Our Linz has taken her first tentative steps into Liverpool's gay scene. If it's really as rubbish as Brookie makes out, there must be closets stuffed with scouse jessies gagging for somewhere decent to dance to Kylie (Minogue, not Lindsey's daughter) and wear their tight, bright white shirts. </p> <p>Of course, telly never does clubbing very well. It doesn't even do dancing. If ever there's a club night at E20 in EastEnders, the place looks like a waiting room for people desperate for a pee. </p> <p>Anyway, Linz was enthusing. \"It's packed in here,\" she breathed, when it quite obviously wasn't, possibly displaying the first signs of agoraphobia. And it was all going splendidly until they met Lance from the bar (Lance is a more Home and Away name, don't you think?) and Shelley's ex, a Bronagh Gallagher lookalike. Suddenly Shelley had a headache and had to go home. And Linz never even got to do her Britney routine (that's dancing, not believing in God and capital punishment). </p> <p>On the Close, Jimmy popped round to Dr Darren's for some more \"tabs\" (unspecified, as prescription drugs always are in Soapland), having gone through them like smack all day. The good doctor snarled: \"This isn't an all-night drop-in centre\". Well, that's not what he tells Susannah, is it? Word to the wise, Darren: don't let her drive you anywhere or you'll find yourself shooting through the windscreen at 100 miles an hour. </p> <p>And not in a nice way. Susannah, meanwhile, was convincing Victoria, Darren's ex, to give up on him so she could have his little injections all to herself. A sticky end awaits that lady. Again, not in a nice way. </p> <p><strong> Find a Fortune</strong> (ITV): steal Carol Vorderman's cheque book. </p>",
  "When people who work from home meet for the first time, they always seem unusually interested not only in the seemingly dull details of each other's work routine - \"What time do you start? When do you have lunch? Do you listen to music/the radio or take any exercise?\" - but also in exactly where they work in their house or flat. Those who have their own room or study tucked away from the other functions of living are regarded with envy, whereas those who fit their workspace into the kitchen or sitting-room are probed about their desk, computer, drawing board, closeness to windows and colour of the room. Working from home supposedly means being in control of your own environment - and, because of that, it always holds the promise of being the perfect place to inspire original thought in an atmosphere of lively contemplation. <p>I work in the messiest room in the house: the children's playroom. Toys are strewn on the floor - Lego models mix with unloved Pok\u00e9mon figures, and Barbies lie in a horrible tangle of plastic flesh. Large, black hardware items such as TVs and long-obsolete games consoles nestle among the debris, so that getting to my desk can be something of an assault course. It could be used by a feng-shui expert as a perfect example of the worst kind of bad chi. </p> <p>A new book, Calm Working Spaces, by Lorrie Mack, aims to \"help create a haven of peace and productivity\". It advises that a tidy and ordered atmosphere will create a sense of purposeful calm. But in my case that would be a waste of precious work time, and a bit pointless considering it will all be messed up as soon as the children get home from school. My desk, too, echoes the general chaos - a pile of interesting bits of paper - letters from people I want to reply to one day, and the first half of a novel I can't get round to finishing. A Russian doll is jammed behind the computer, and a fairy's wand, half eaten by the dog, sticks out of the file I have laughingly marked \"Life\". I sit wedged between two large windows, which allows me to spy on the goings-on of my unusually dramatic street - crack dealers getting arrested and the family who come outdoors to solve their domestic problems - without (I hope) being seen. I have to admit that my ex-husband had a curtain structure, like something you might find in a hospital ward, built around my desk, so that when his friends came to visit he could hide the horror of my workspace, but it works all right for me. </p> <p>If I analyse my attitude towards my workspace, it is that I am unwilling to make a fuss. My work just fits in with the life around it. Not for me the self-important demands of other friends who use rooms in other people's homes, have attic extensions built or move, slightly desperately, around the tables and desks in their own house in an attempt to discover somewhere really conducive to work. My mother-in-law has written quite a few novels sitting on the top stair. Of course, if you are going to write a masterpiece, you could do it on the loo. </p> <p>And yet... I do dream of somewhere that might exist, in a place I have not yet moved into, that would suit the person I have unfortunately not yet become. It is creamy and spacious, with drawers and neat storage for all my talismanic bits of paper. There is no clutter, no overlap from domestic life. Such a room demands concentration: it would hold you prisoner to its potential, so that it would feel quite wrong to attempt an escape and lunge at the digestives in the kitchen drawer for the fourth time that morning. But a workspace such as this would be unrealistic for me. I would soon spill coffee over the creamy wood. Perhaps it would be better to have somewhere just as light and breezy. Unfortunately, I have a flibbertigibbet side, which sends too many emails and chats on the phone, and a workspace with any sign of frivolity would probably make me want to go shopping rather then write for long hours in front of the computer. No, I think the ideal workspace for me would be somewhere with the \"clubby\" feel of a study, where a gentleman might go to ponder, smoke a pipe and look at the naughty daguerreotypes of an evening. Somewhere full of shiny, dark wood, comfortable old chairs and the slight smell of beeswax, which would give me the gravitas I often seem to lack. </p> <p> Not that I want somewhere full of books. While I agree that working in the productive atmosphere of, say, a library can be a change from the sometimes claustrophobic feeling of working from home, when the books are your own they can add an unwelcome weightiness. I not only feel guilty about those I have not yet read, but also about those I did once read, when my mind was eagerly studious. Looking towards the bookshelves near my desk I see a Carlos Fuentes that I have never got around to, and dozens of literary criticism, as well as Hegel's The Philosophy Of History, which I know I will probably never pick up again. Better to put inspiring objects on those shelves and store the old books somewhere that won't make me feel heavy with responsibility and nostalgia. </p> <p>The only thing I may have got right about my workspace is the colour. It is a wonderful bright yellow that keeps me cheery even in the most gloomy of English summers. In a fit of enthusiasm for my workspace, I sweep the most obviously distracting objects into a cupboard beneath the snake tank. This activity disturbs the large Californian king snake (named King Jim by my then five-year-old son) and he flops around a bit. Obviously, keeping a snake is cruel and nasty, yet here I am spending hours each day right next to it. What would a feng-shui expert make of that? Perhaps that is why I am broke; the bloody reptile is obviously in my money corner </p> <p>\u0095 Calm Working Spaces, by Lorrie Mack, is published by Marshall Publishing, at \u00a318.99.

  "It was the first single-word culinary dilemma that had been sent to Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, so it would have been churlish to pass it over. \"Problem - age!\" Norma Haemmerle had written with remarkable succinctness. \"At 69, I get tired if I have to spend too much time on preparation. My partner, Richard, is older, and is on a low-cholesterol diet, but we both love to eat. And home-cooked food always tastes better than ready meals/frozen things, etc.\" How true, thought Rosie, and set her grey matter to devising a set of good-value, easy-to-prepare dishes (the words \"one\" and \"pot\" sprang immediately to mind) with which to alleviate Norma's burden, a task complicated just a little by Richard's unshakable aversion to tomato in all its manifestations. <p>And so it was that the KD arrived one wet summer's day at the Haemmerle's Arnos Grove home - as northern a part of north London as you could find without stumbling into the countryside - laden with enough comestibles to create five mouth-watering meals, each of which would take no longer than half-an-hour to prepare. \"Not only will I not have to cook for a week,\" exclaimed Norma gleefully on seeing bag after bag unpacked in her kitchen, \"but Richard - who is very good about saying, 'You look tired', and then going for a takeaway, so I don't have to cook - won't have to trek outside, either.\" </p> <p>\"Most of this can be cooked and then frozen,\" explained Rosie, before coming over all worried at the thought of leaving Norma and Richard with five dinners but nowhere to store them: \"I hope you have enough room in your freezer.\" </p> <p>She needn't have fretted - Norma had been busy: \"Actually, I emptied it a bit this morning.\" </p> <p>Rosie breathed easier, and set about preparing the first two dishes, pot-roast poussin with apple, parsnip, ginger and potato mash, and spiced lamb with spinach and bulgur. \"Cooking would be much easier if I had you here to do the vegetables for me every day,\" said Norma. \"You see, I like to read cookbooks, to drool over the recipes, but when it comes to lunchtime... don't you core the apples?\" She seemed a little concerned all of a sudden. </p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" replied Rosie, \" but I always quarter them first. That way, you can make sure you cut out all of those horrid hard white bits in the core - 'toenails', my mother used to call them.\" </p> <p>\"Ughh -that doesn't sound very appetising,\" grimaced Norma as she assumed a position next to Richard, giving them the perfect vantage point from which to watch Rosie go about her business, browning the meats, and peeling, chopping and dicing like a mad thing. </p> <p>\"Er, do you use spices much?\" asked Rosie, her features again succumbing to that little expression of alarm as she surveyed the fresh and dried spices arrayed on the worktop. </p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" replied Norma, \"in soups and the like, but I don't really know how to use them properly.\" </p> <p>\"You shouldn't worry about that ,\" said Rosie, who, it must be said seemed rather relieved at Norma's response. \"It's all about trial and error; you work it out as you go along. That's how I learned to use them, anyway - do you cook at all, Richard?\" </p> <p>\"Well, I would,\" he answered, a little sheepishly, \"but Norma doesn't really trust my cooking.\" </p> <p>\"I trust you to open a tin of beans,\" laughed Norma. But Richard wasn't paying attention - his head was almost in the lamb pot. </p> <p>\"It doesn't need any accompaniment,\" said Rosie quickly, perhaps for fear that Richard was about to gobble up the pot's contents. \"It's got spinach for roughage and bulgur wheat for bulk.\" </p> <p>Richard raised his head, apparently drunk on the heady scent of cinnamon and cumin. \"It smells magnificent,\" he said. </p> <p>Then it was into the oven with the lamb and chicken, and on to the remaining dishes: a soup, a cod-and-bean combo and a clafoutis (\"Just a posh word for a toad-in-the-hole type thingy,\" explained Rosie). But as she set about getting everything ready, Rosie's perturbed demeanour reappeared: \"Um . . . I was meant to be doing things that didn't involve too much standing up and chopping, wasn't I, but I seem to have done little else since I got here.\" </p> <p>\"That's because you're making five meals at once,\" said Norma, \"which is not something I'll be doing, is it?\" </p> <p>\"I hadn't thought of that,\" said Rosie, as if for the first time realising that people in the real world, unlike professional cooks, tend to make only one meal at a time. \"The soup will be ready soon, so you could have it for lunch. It's a minestrone sort of thing, only without tomatoes.\" </p> <p>\"That's in honour of you, Richard,\" said Norma. </p> <p>\"I expected you just to come here and cook,\" said Richard, \"not to cater to our idiosyncrasies.\" Mind you, he didn't seem disappointed that she had. </p> <p>\"Well, the whole shebang is geared to you ,\" said Rosie. \"That's why I rang beforehand, to check if there was anything either of you hated.\" </p> <p>\"Indeed,\" said Norma. \"And I wish I'd been thinking more clearly when you called - I would have asked for nothing but Belgian chocolates!\" </p> <p>The soup was now ready, and the clafoutis and fish were well on their way. \"There you go,\" said Rosie, popping a blob of pesto on top of each soup serving and handing them over to Richard and Norma. </p> <p>\"This is super,\" said Norma after the first spoonful. \"Ahem, sorry, I didn't mean to say that,\" she said of the unintentional pun. \"This is delicious, rather.\" </p> <p>Rosie, meantime, was busy checking on her clafoutis. \"It smells good,\" she said. \"But then, I'm a sucker for cheese. It looks fantastic, too . . . Oh dear, I've done a lot of blowing my own trumpet today.\" </p> <p>\"Don't you worry,\" said Norma benevolently. \"I'll second you. It's been a bit like going to a cookery school, except I'm the only pupil.\" </p> <p>Richard, who had popped out of the kitchen for a moment, reappeared. \"You've come back at the right moment,\" said Norma. \"I don't know how you do it, but you always arrive the moment something comes out of the oven or off the stove.\" </p> <p>Richard just grinned contentedly and dived into the clafoutis. \"Lovely - but it's a bit hot,\" he said, puffing his cheeks as if it were burning their insides. He obviously wasn't that incapacitated, however, for he positively pounced on Rosie's next offering, the cod-and-bean stew. \"Careful,\" warned Norma. \"That, too, is still very hot.\" </p> <p>\"It's fabulous,\" said Richard, taking another forkful. \"Never mind just a taste: I'm eating all of this\" </p> <p> All recipes serve two. </p> <p><b> Spiced lamb with spinach and bulgur</b></p> <p> I've used the bulgur a bit like pearl barley - whatever, it is an excellent way to get some starch into the meal.</p> <p><b> 1 small onion, chopped <br> 1 clove garlic, crushed <br> 450g diced lamb <br> 2 tsp cinnamon <br> 1 tsp ground cumin <br> 1 tsp ground coriander <br> 4 tbsp plain flour, seasoned <br> 75ml white wine <br> 150ml meat stock <br> 125g frozen, chopped spinach <br> 2 tbsp olive oil <br> 100g bulgur wheat <br> 200ml water <br> 1 tbsp butter <br> 2 tbsp pinenuts <br> 2 tbsp raisins</b> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Heat the oil in a casserole, toss the lamb in the flour, and add to the casserole, along with the spices (you may need to do this in batches). When all the meat is browned, push it to one side of the pan, add the garlic and onion, and saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft. Mix everything in the pan together, pour in the wine and stock, bring to the boil, cover, and put into the oven. Leave it to do its thing for about an hour. </p> <p>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy pan and add the bulgur, stirring to coat all the grains with butter. Add the water, bring to the boil and simmer until the liquid is absorbed - about 15 minutes. Set the cooked wheat to one side. </p> <p>Return the casserole to the top of the stove, add the spinach and bulgur, bring back to the boil and put back in the oven for around 15 minutes, until the wheat is fully puffed up. Stir in the raisins and pinenuts before serving. </p> <p> <b> Pot-roast poussin</b></p> <p> A great one-pot dish, giving you a meal of crispy poussin with mash and gravy: the end result is fantastically moist. </p> <p><b> 1 decent-sized poussin <br> 30g butter <br> 1 tbsp oil <br> lemon, juiced <br> 2 apples, peeled, cored and quartered <br> 2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks <br> 2 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks <br> 1 tsp fresh ginger, peeled and grated <br> head garlic, peeled <br> 1 splash brandy (optional) <br> 60ml cider <br> 1 bouquet garni</b> </p> <p>Heat half the butter and oil in a frying pan, pop in the poussin and brown all over. Remove the bird and, while the pan is still hot, add the cider and brandy, stirring to loosen all the bits and cooking flavours in the pan. </p> <p>Grease a large casserole with the remaining butter. Toss the apple and ginger in lemon juice. Arrange the potatoes, parsnips and apples in the base of the casserole, followed by the garlic cloves. Stuff the juiced lemon and bouquet garni into the poussin's cavity and place the bird, breast-side down, on the apple-and-vegetable bed. Pour over the cider/brandy mix from the pan, cover, and cook in the oven for an hour, until the juices from the bird run clear. </p> <p>Lift out the bird and leave to rest for a few minutes. Strain off any cooking liquor, to use as a sauce. Mash the solids, or put them in a blender for a smoother result. Cut the poussin in half and serve with the mashed veg, gravy and maybe some peas or broccoli. </p> <p><b> Cod with white beans</b></p> <p> Based on a delicious recipe from my friend, Sue Lewis, head chef at the Cow in west London. Hers has tomato in it; I have made it without, by request. </p> <p><b> 450g cod fillets, cut into chunks <br> 1 tbsp oil <br> 1 onion, finely chopped <br> 1 red pepper, cut into strips <br> 2 rashers smoked bacon, de-rinded and chopped into pieces <br> 1 tsp paprika <br> 60ml white wine <br> 375ml fish stock <br> 1 tin cannellini beans <br> 1 clove garlic, crushed <br> 1 handful parsley, chopped <br> 1 lemon, rind grated</b> </p> <p>Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan, add the bacon and fry until it begins to brown. Add the onion, and sweat until soft. Add the red pepper and paprika, and saut\u00e9 until soft. Pour in the wine and reduce by half. Chuck in the beans and stock, bring to the boil, and simmer for 15 minutes to let the flavours come together. If you run low on liquid, top up with water. Season the fish, add it to the pot, and simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes until the flesh is opaque, a sign that it is cooked. </p> <p>Meanwhile, mix together the garlic, parsley and lemon zest (a mixture known as gremolata), stir into the casserole and serve immediately with some good bread and a green salad. </p> <p><b> Savoury clafoutis</b></p> <p> A nice, quick lunch dish, or a side dish to grilled meat or sausages. These quantities make more than enough for two, but you can freeze them.</p> <p><b> 55g plain flour, sifted and seasoned <br> 1 egg <br> 70ml milk mixed with 70ml water <br> 45g pitted black olives <br> 4 spring onions, finely chopped <br> 55g taleggio (or mozzarella) <br> 55g Parmesan, grated <br> 4 anchovy fillets, chopped <br> Butter, for greasing</b> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Tip the flour into a bowl. Beat the egg into the water/milk mix. Make a well in the centre of the flour, tip in the egg mixture, stir to dissolve the flour, and leave to stand. Grease a baking tin (or tins) and put it in the fridge. Roughly chop the olives, break the taleggio into chunks and tip into a bowl, along with the anchovies and spring onions. Mix together and check the seasoning. </p> <p>Pour a little batter into the bottom of the tin, put a generous spoonful of the cheese, anchovy and onion mixture on top, and fill the baking tin with the remaining batter. Sprinkle with Parmesan and bake for 30-35 minutes, until the clafoutis is risen and golden. If you're making a big one, this may take up to 45 minutes. Serve immediately with a salad. </p> <p><b> Big soup</b></p> <p> My version of a minestrone-style soup. I use chickpeas instead of white beans, because I love their nutty, earthy taste. The stock and pesto can be homemade, of course, but we're going for speed and ease here. Also, a tin of tomatoes would not go amiss, but I have not used any because Richard really doesn't like them. </p> <p><b> 1 tin chickpeas (or 350g dried chickpeas, soaked, drained and cooked) <br> 55g soup pasta, or even spaghetti broken into 4cm lengths <br> 1 litre vegetable stock <br> 2 leeks, trimmed and sliced <br> 1 head broccoli, broken into florets, the stalks peeled and cut into slices <br> 1 courgette, cut into rounds <br> 1 head fennel, trimmed and sliced <br> 1 large carrot, peeled and cubed <br> 55g French beans, top and tailed <br> 6 new potatoes, washed and halved <br> 2 large tbsp pesto <br> 2 slices white bread <br> 1 clove garlic, peeled</b> </p> <p>Put the carrot, new potatoes, fennel and leeks in large pan with the stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the chickpeas, courgettes, beans, broccoli and pasta, then simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and season. </p> <p>Toast the bread, rub it with garlic (the toast will act like a grater), drizzle with olive oil and place in the bottom of two soup bowls.

  "<p>When Cardinal Thomas Winning departs his archdiocesan offices in Glasgow for one of his regular trips to Rome, he likes to leave the trappings of ecclesiastical seniority behind. While other cardinals in the holy city can be identified by the splash of scarlet which peeks from below their dog collars, Winning favours an unremarkable black suit and the anonymity of a plain white band. </p> <p>On any of these visits it is not uncommon to find the cardinal socialising in the bars and trattorias, mixing with Catholic clergy from across the world. He is an affable, rather charming man, and priests, unaware that they are in the presence of a prince of their church, often gravitate towards his easy conversation. Occasionally the cardinal allows them to gossip, dropping little snippets of church tittle-tattle and speculation before him. He listens intently, face blank. Then, just past the crucial moment, one of his aides introduces his eminence. Red faces and ring-kissing follow. </p> <p>The cardinal appears rather to relish the shock he has created. It is a trait to be found on an altogether larger scale in his public life. There can be few clergymen this century who have even come close to issuing as many explosive moral jolts as Cardinal Thomas Joseph Winning. The headlines speak for themselves. The cardinal's proclamations on everything from the danger of modern-day Britons becoming \"spiritual dwarfs\", through Prince Charles's \"woolly\" views on Christianity, to the \"utter failure\" that is the Scottish parliament, keep the Scottish press busy on an almost weekly basis - and the London-based media too, when he hits the right buttons. </p> <p>This week, he condemned the government's chief medical officer's recommendation that clearance be given to the use of human embryos in stem cell research. In typically forthright - and populist - style the cardinal said this gave \"morally repugnant\" authorisation for a \"production line\" approach to human lives. </p> <p>Some commentators put this regular association with screaming headlines down to an uncontrollable propensity to shoot from the hip, as if Winning wields some sort of smoking moral gun - hidden within his crosier - that he just can't help discharging. Those who know him, however, say the deliverance of the decrees owes more to careful strategy than chaotic release. </p> <p>\"He has a track record of making these statements and then backing off from the controversy. He is not prepared to brook criticism,\" says a Catholic who has known him since he was a parish priest. \"But they are not issued at random, they are nearly always discussed beforehand with the 'yes men' around him.\" </p> <p>It is there, though, behind the mirrored-glass walls of the archdiocese headquarters in Glasgow, that the discussions have a habit of ending. It is a trait which annoys Winning's more progressive clergy. \"There is no machinery for consultation, there is no point along the way where the hierarchy is forced to listen,\" says Father John Fitzsimmons, parish priest at St John Bosco's in Erskine, Renfrewshire, and one of the few members of the clergy prepared to speak out publicly against the cardinal's conservatism. \"That style of leadership suppresses free and open debate and can only be unhealthy.\" </p> <p>Winning is similarly remote with the media. Once he has planted his moral explosive, calls to his press team are met with brick-wall answers such as \"the cardinal has made his position clear on that\". The cardinal is never available to defend his position. For a man who generates so many column inches, he rarely grants interviews and he declined to elaborate on his thoughts for this profile. \"He only gives interviews when he has something to say,\" said Ronnie Convery, his press aide. </p> <p>To Winning, the church is everything. He is utterly devout and certain of his faith, not just in God but in Catholic doctrine. He does not question Rome's certainties and he has difficulty seeing why anyone else should. \"Cardinal Winning believes absolutely in the teachings of the Catholic church: there's right and wrong, that's it,\" says Eddie Barnes, editor of the Scottish Catholic Observer. \"There are problems with communication and the way he deals with the media, but, ultimately, he believes it is his job to make sure Catholics know where the church stands, and not to get involved in drawn-out arguments.\" </p> <p>It is an aim he achieves with more than a measure of panache. In Rome, the conservative hierarchy which surrounds the current pontiff, Pope John Paul II, is pleased with the way the Scottish cardinal runs his moral crusade. Winning's own bishops, too, unite behind him - although some are understood to be occasionally irritated at being bounced into the latest round of publicity with no consultation or warning. This unity is also not entirely harmonious: even the cardinal's friends concede he does not tolerate disobedience, while his harshest critics accuse him of dominating his bishops, listening to them only when they hint at open revolt. They offer little public dissent, however, and it is only in the pews, among his 750,000-strong Catholic flock and beyond, that the cardinal cannot be certain of solid support. \"His statements are totally off the wall,\" says Father Fitzsimmons. \"Tom Winning should not be deceived into thinking he can open his mouth and everyone will fall into place. Many in the church are dismayed by his recent performance. They have to go out and make the church credible while he makes it appear more and more extreme.\" </p> <p>Catholic church attendance is down as it is across the Christian faiths; the number of Catholic marriages is also falling; most Catholics use contraception, despite the cardinal's vocal condemnation; and surveys show that most believe in abortion in exceptional circumstances - rape, severe abnormality of the foetus - spurning Winning's view that it is akin to the Dunblane massacre. </p> <p>The position of Catholicism in the west of Scotland, an area of which the cardinal is so much the product, has changed immeasurably since he was a young man. The sectarianism has diminished, Catholics now hold positions of power, the Catholic church is no longer so central to communities, even the notion that children must attend schools dictated by their religious denomination is perceptibly on the wane. </p> <p>Yet it is the traits and idiosyncrasies of the old west of Scotland that mark the cardinal - and the best clues to the cleric perhaps lie there. He was born on June 3 1925 in Lanarkshire. By present-day standards they were undoubtedly impoverished beginnings. Craigneuk, his home town, was a bleak place where steel and mining provided the only reliable mainstay of family incomes. </p> <p>His father, Thomas, though, reaped none of the modest material gain offered by the dirty, industrial giants: at various stages he was both a miner and a steel worker but by the time his first child was born he was unemployed and would remain so for 15 years. Home for his family was a basic two rooms and kitchen; cramped conditions for Winning, his parents and, later, his sister, Margaret, to live under, but they were no worse than those of neighbours and undoubtedly better than those in nearby Glasgow's slums. </p> <p>Whatever the poverty, it went unnoticed by the young Winning. His mother, he has said, managed the purse strings well and his father steered the family safely through the worst ravages of the Depression by making and selling sweets. The poverty was also accompanied by a characteristic common to many of the west of Scotland's working class of that era: a steely parental determination to get something better for the children. </p> <p>As Winning grew up, there was always the steadfast constancy of Roman Catholicism, as immutable a part of the family's life as the slag heaps and pit winding gear which dotted the countryside around them. By the age of 10, Winning was an altar boy, assisting at morning mass, preparing communion amid the scent of incense and the sound of Latin, before heading off to the local Catholic school. Only gradually did he realise that he wanted to be a priest. There was no great sign or epiphany; if anything his vocation seems to have sprung as much from the practical as the spiritual. He is a very practical sort of Catholic - a trait, perhaps, which fires his politicism - and he says it was watching priests at work in the community that persuaded him he wanted to join the priesthood. </p> <p>Those were the days when religious tribalism in the west of Scotland was at its most unpalatable. In public life and in the workplace, Catholics had to put up with appalling discrimination. Careers were closed to them simply because of their faith; in other professions they would be allowed a foot in the door, but would never rise above a certain rank. </p> <p>The sectarianism was more prevalent on a mundane level. In the rough communities of Lanarkshire, religion was a defining marker - and the religious bigotry of adults filtered down to children. When Winning was a schoolboy, it was routine for boys to stop other children in the street and ask whether they were Catholic or Protestant. The wrong answered resulted in a kicking. Winning was as prone to these unsolicited inquiries as any other child, but, despite the gradual realisation of his vocation, he took a pragmatic line. \"Many's the time I denied my faith to get to school on time,\" he said. </p> <p>He may have taken the easiest way out on those occasions, but the memory of discrimination against Catholics is something he carried with him to later life. It, and the poverty he witnessed as a child, no doubt lie behind his vocal fight against social injustice. </p> <p>In 1946, he left Lanarkshire to travel to Rome across a Europe desolated by war. It was a hellish three-day train journey and, when he, and 33 other seminarians, arrived at the Pontifical Scots College in the Piazza di Trevi, they found it boarded up, having been closed for almost a decade while the Vatican and Mussolini accommodated each other. Winning was not a natural scholar, but he worked hard and soon mastered fluent Italian and enviable Latin. (He once refined his skills in the latter by translating the match reports of his beloved Celtic football team.) </p> <p>At the Scots College, his unconventionality was soon apparent. When the seminarians were asked if it was ever correct to cheat the system, everyone wrote no - save Winning. He argued that extreme poverty made it justifiable. It is a position he still holds, to the annoyance of various rent-a-quote MPs: \"If your children are going to be hungry, if you get to the stage of extreme hunger, anybody's property becomes yours, because you have a right to survive. You can break into a bread van and steal a loaf. It would not be immoral to do that,\" he has said. </p> <p>He has also criticised the withdrawal of student grants: \"This, in addition to the new burden of student fees, is, I would suggest, an alien concept to a Scotland which is proud of its tradition of free schooling and classless academic life.\" </p> <p>In 1948 he was ordained - his father had to sell the confectionery equipment to finance the family's trip to Rome to watch the ceremony in St John Lateran's Basilica - and the following year he returned to a Lanarkshire parish with a newly acquired taste in fine wines. To observers, it didn't take long to spot that Winning was going to be more than a parish priest. \"He is very good looking, very charming. People thought of him as the good-looking, untouchable Richard Chamberlain type. They wanted him to succeed and it was always obvious he was destined for higher office.\" says Rennie McOwan, Scottish correspondent for the Catholic weekly, the Tablet. </p> <p>Despite the good looks, Winning, unlike many priests, never had any trouble with women. He admits to finding the celibacy incumbent on all Catholic priests - save those who have switched over from the Church of England - at times difficult to bear, but he has always been a reserved, old-fashioned sort of cleric, and he has never allowed the non-clergy to get too close, particularly if they are women. </p> <p>The next major step in Winning's career came in 1961 when he was asked to return to Rome to become spiritual director of the Scots College. In the shadow of the Vatican he prospered. Although Winning has the conventional degrees, he admits he is not an intellectual. His favourite thing about school was \"Saturday\" and he has never written any heavyweight theological works. What he does have, however, is a lawyerly mind, and in Rome, that helped enormously. \"He is forceful and good with people, qualities that matter in the Vatican,\" says McOwan. Winning did not play the ecclesiastical politics of the Eternal City, but his straightforwardness shone. </p> <p>He made his name and good contacts, contacts which would prove invaluable in the deal which, in 1982, eventually brought him to the attention of the Pope whose visit to Scotland, the first pontifical visit to the country, tottered on the brink of collapse. Behind the scenes at the Vatican, a group of Latin American cardinals were manoeuvring to have the pontiff cancel his visit, claiming the Falklands war was a hurdle which could not be overcome. The Pope wanted to come to Scotland, but the Latin Americans said this would be interpreted as an insult to Argentina. </p> <p>Scotland's then cardinal, Cardinal Gray, was ailing, so Winning, along with Derek Worlock, then archbishop of Liverpool, travelled to Rome to mount a counterattack. Winning knew which ears to whisper in and a diplomatic compromise was reached: there would be a mass of reconciliation at St Peter's and the Pope would visit both countries. Winning's part in brokering the deal was noted by the Pope and his senior advisors. </p> <p>Twelve years later he had his reward - at least in part. In Rome, the Pope placed the red biretta on Winning's head and kissed the cheek of the new cardinal he had created, only the second resident in Scotland since the Reformation. Outside, Winning was met by the sort of incongruous scenes more commonly associated with the national football squad: saltire-waving, bagpipe-playing masses. St Peter's Square was awash with the tartan of 1500 pilgrims. </p> <p>\"You have always been what is called a man of the people,\" said the Pope. It is an image Winning's advisors are keen to cultivate. \"He is equally at home with royalty or chatting away to a wee guy standing at the back of the church,\" says Convery. In this common-touch vein, much has been made of his love for Celtic football club. Nestled among the opera CDs at his home on the southside of Glasgow, there's a cassette of Celtic football songs entitled Echoes Of The Jungle 95/96. At every home game the cardinal can be found in the stands of Parkhead, sitting beside his nephew and making use of his pensioner's season ticket. (Though he avoids Celtic and Rangers matches, disliking the blatant sectarianism.) </p> <p>The association with Celtic, however, does not please everyone. In the west of Scotland football still carries with it the taint of religious bigotry. Winning's advisors have occasionally tried to persuade him to stop going to matches in the interests of ecumenicalism. Perhaps understandably, he will have no truck with their argument. However some within his inner circle say this is not prompted solely by a love of his team, but also by a failure to realise that Celtic and the Catholic church are no longer inextricably linked. </p> <p>The low point came when he was still the archbishop of Glasgow and attempted to hold a Catholic church commemorative ceremony at Celtic Park. Although his bishops told him it was inappropriate, Winning continued to insist the football stadium was the best venue and only backed down when some of his clergy made it clear they would not attend. </p> <p>But if he is occasionally out of touch with the changing social tides of Scotland, no-one can accuse him of being naive. He has been cardinal for less than a decade, but under his control the Catholic church has become a vocal force. Tom Devine, Scotland's pre-eminent historian, says: \"It would have been unthinkable for a Roman Catholic prelate to have the confidence to say the things Winning does even two or three decades ago. Roman Catholicism is now regarded as mainstream, a fundamental move away from Scotland's Presbyterian social identity. The fact that he is taken seriously is a reflection of that historical change. I am not convinced, however, that it means the Roman Catholic church has more power.\" </p> <p>Whether he actually has power or not, Winning undoubtedly has influence. He has come closer than anyone else to accusing Tony Blair of outright hypocrisy on his stance on abortion. The battle between the two over the issue began in 1996 when a conversation between them and the then shadow Scottish secretary, George Robertson, turned to the subject. Blair said, as a Christian, that he was opposed to abortion, but he did not wish to enforce his views on other people. The cardinal replied by asking Blair in what other area of policy he applied this logic. Blair was flustered, but the meeting ended good naturedly enough. </p> <p>Around eight months later, Winning appeared on a BBC documentary accusing the prime minister of taking a \"sham\" stance on abortion. Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, immediately called on some Scottish MPs to hit back at Winning. The cardinal was furious - he has a notoriously foul temper - and asked for a meeting with Blair. The relationship between the two has been frosty since and the cardinal often makes attacks on the Labour party. He has said: \"The embers of totalitarianism are not far from the surface of New Labour.\" </p> <p>On abortion, as in most things, Winning is hugely conservative. Surprisingly, though, his most famous and controversial tactic of launching a scheme which paid women to keep their babies received the praise of Germaine Greer for offering a real alternative. The cardinal was grateful for Greer's intervention. He noted \"she seemed gradually to be becoming more like other women rather than an outright feminist\". Until recently, it was Winning's immutable opposition to abortion, along with contraception, celibacy and women priests which most often took him into the newspapers. </p> <p>There are plenty in the church who disagree with his conservative stance, but most concede he is simply enforcing papal teaching. \"There is no cardinal who is not bound to the teachings of the church, it is his job to get them across,\" says Joseph Devine, Bishop of Motherwell. But then came Section 28. When the Scottish executive announced earlier this year that it planned to repeal the law which bans the promotion of the acceptability of homosexuality in schools, Winning waded in. He had become involved in politics before - condemning the Gulf war, or berating Labour for bashing the Scottish nationalists - but this was the first time he had taken such a blatant and provocatively hostile stand against the government. The cardinal attacked Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, over the proposed repeal and enraged equal rights campaigners, and many in his own church, when he said: \"It pains me to use the word perverted when discussing the homosexual act, but that is what it is.\" </p> <p>It was typical Winning, but, even within his own church, most thought he had gone too far. \"The cardinal was putting forward the church's teaching, but it was the intemperance of his words that infuriated the gay Catholic community,\" says Father John Breslin, a priest who works closely with Quest, a support group for gay Catholics. \"It is good for anyone in a position of authority to listen to those on the ground and I think there is maybe not enough listening happening just now.\" </p> <p>Winning, however, did not stop there. To the exasperation of the executive, he sent a letter of support to Brian Souter, the multi-millionaire businessman who spent at least \u00a31m of his own money financing a campaign and referendum to keep the clause. As the debate dipped to baser and baser levels, particularly in Scotland's main tabloids, it was exactly the sort of intervention the executive didn't need. </p> <p>A liberal Catholic source close to the Scottish cabinet says: \"I think what we are really saddened by is that we have a cardinal who is more concerned about sex than social justice. This was a piece of discriminatory legislation and, from the cardinal's own background, you would have thought he would have understood that. He attacks Labour because of issues around sexuality and ignores the work we do on child poverty. Everyone expected the parliament to bring a new enlightened Scotland, but there are still some unpleasant attitudes out there and we have to take them on.\" </p> <p>Although Winning is, at heart, probably still an Old Labour man, his relationship with New Labour has been glacial for some time and he moves ever closer towards the Scottish National party. Those who know him well say he has always secretly wanted an independent Scotland. In the past, he has certainly made allusions in that direction. During the bloody years which led to the end of apartheid in South Africa, he once said mass in Soweto. In his sermon he declared: \"You want freedom, we want freedom.\" Those around him say this was an only partially veiled expression of hope for an independent Scotland. </p> <p>The retiring SNP leader, Alex Salmond, is well aware that, through the sectarian hue which can colour west of Scotland politics, the SNP is still thought of as anti-Catholic: Catholics vote disproportionately for Labour, and Salmond has been keen to woo them. Before the Scottish parliamentary elections, Winning planned to help him. He wrote a pamphlet entitled Make Your Cross Count which was all but a ringing endorsement of the SNP. </p> <p>It did not, however, make it to the congregation in its original form. At least four bishops made it clear they would publicly distance themselves from the pamphlet if Winning did not moderate its stance away from the SNP. After around four redrafts, a compromise document was finally unveiled. </p> <p>Both Labour and the SNP know the vocal power of the cardinal. Since devolution his voice has become stronger. He neither wishes to be nor has the chance of becoming Pope and, at 75, he appears determined to make his last years count in Scotland. His critics say he has become overtly political, moving towards the SNP, because he believes the church would play a stronger role in an independent Scotland. Others say he is a hard-working man of conviction, who simply will not be silenced. \"He has an incredible staying power. He has an extraordinary commitment to the job which just seems to get stronger as he ages,\" says Bishop Devine. </p> <p>But as Winning, perhaps the most famous clergyman in the country, continues to dominate the nation's moral debates, there is a whisper coming from the pews. He undoubtedly leads Scotland's 750,000 Catholics, but whether he is representative of them is another question entirely. \"Does he speak for me? No he does not,\" says Father Fitzsimmons. \"He is, of course, entitled to these opinions, but they are not held by the Catholics I deal with day in, day out.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Thomas Joseph Winning </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> June 3 1925, Wishaw, Lanarkshire. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> St. Patrick's Primary School, Shieldmuir, Lanarkshire; Our Lady's High School, Motherwell, Lanarkshire; St Peter's College, Glasgow; Pontifical Scots College, Rome; Gregorian University, Rome. </p> <p><strong> Church Career: </strong> Ordained priest, Rome, 1948; graduated doctor of canon law, Gregorian University, 1953; assistant priest, St. Mary's, Hamilton 1953-57; spiritual director, Pontifical Scots College, Rome, 1961-66; Parish priest, Saint Luke's, Motherwell, 1966-70; auxiliary bishop, archdiocese of Glasgow, 1971; Archbishop of Glasgow, 1974; created cardinal priest, November 26 1994, with title of S.

  "<p>Oxford United issued a statement this week that its \"directors, players and officials fully support Ross Weatherstone at this difficult time\". </p> <p>Which particular difficult time is it that requires such sympathetic handling? Is Weatherstone the latest contestant to be evicted from the Big Brother house? Or does the poor lad need to be counselled from the trauma of discovering that Arsenal haven't stepped in over the close season to sign him? </p> <p>Well, no. Weatherstone was this week convicted of threatening behaviour towards an Asian taxi driver, behaviour involving a nasty drunken assault conducted to a racist soundtrack. After picking up Weatherstone and some of his plastered chums in the early hours of the morning, the driver lost control of his vehicle and crashed when one of his customers smashed the taxi's partition window and attempted to throttle him. </p> <p>Since the club has refused to elaborate on its bald statement, no one knows whether the player has received any punishment beyond the \u00a3500 fine ordered by magistrates. But if ever there was a case for public action by a football club, this is it. </p> <p>Some might say sacking Weatherstone would be a good idea, though this was never a serious possibility given the adjectives generally applied to club and player (\"cash-strapped\" and \"highly promising\" respectively). Nevertheless, he ought to be handed a lengthy playing suspension and be sent to conduct some sort of community service coaching young Asian footballers. </p> <p>Moreover - though many might consider the poor man has suffered enough already - the victim of the assault should be offered a free season ticket to the Manor Ground. Instead, Oxford issue public statements about the player which sound for all the world as if he were the one at the wrong end of a drunken early-morning shoeing. </p> <p>And where exactly is the PFA in all this? Where, for that matter, is the FA with its fancy new mission statement about using \"the power of football to build a better future\"? Silent as usual.</p>",
  "<p>The English Premiership football season should be opening with a navel review. The sport has never been so popular and fans can barely wait for the action to begin but not for a long time has the domestic product found itself so urgently in need of serious self-analysis. </p> <p>Beyond the annual speculation about which team, if any, is most likely to deprive Manchester United of another Premiership title and which, apart from United, is capable of making a serious impact in the Champions League there lies the broader question of what needs to be done to improve the spectacle post-Euro 2000; a tournament that brought home to many the often second-rate nature of the English game. </p> <p>A year ago, when Manchester United were champions of Europe, and England's bids for the European Championship and to host the 2006 World Cup still had substance, such criticism would have been regarded as jaundiced and unnecessary. Now, following not only England's summer flop but the premature departures of Norway, Sweden, Germany and Denmark, all represented in the Premier League, it is highly pertinent. </p> <p>Yes, France triumphed in Euro 2000 with the help of Arsenal's Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, while Marcel Desailly of Chelsea was one of the tournament's outstanding players. But the influence of Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars for Holland was fitful and Jaap Stam's penalty in the semi-final shootout with Italy was almost comical. </p> <p>This year the European game has taken another of its technical and tactical leaps forward with English football, despite its proliferation of foreign imports, caught napping. The defining moment came, not in Euro 2000 but during those 10 minutes at Old Trafford in the Champions League quarter-final when Real Madrid, already ahead of Manchester United tactically, destroyed what was left of the myth of United's global supremacy following the Fifa world club championship in January. </p> <p>In May Real regained the European Cup with a display of attacking football which, for speed, verve and technical excellence, was never equalled even in the best European Championship since 1984. The fact that an English player, Steve McManaman, had a leading role in Real's triumph suggested that all need be far from lost in the domestic game. </p> <p>Talent is beginning to come through. Close behind West Ham's Joe Cole and Jon Harley at Chelsea are the likes of Robert Wolleaston, another Stamford Bridge youngster, and Tottenham's Matthew Etherington. </p> <p>In the short term, however, football in England is bound to suffer by comparision with the fresh standards set by Real Madrid, France, Italy, Portugal and Holland, while that played by England already looks prehistoric. When the sole alternative to David Beckham's crosses lies in whacking long balls up to two strikers, is it any wonder Kevin Keegan's side failed as it did? </p> <p>A bad performance in Paris against France followed by disappointing results in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland could see Keegan and the Football Association deciding that enough is enough. Eventually even the cheerleading has to stop. </p> <p>England will never win another major tournament unless a Premier League fondly sanctioned by the FA to strengthen the development of a successful national team returns to the original prospectus - a remote possibility at present. The football played by this summer's successful teams owed everything to the skill, vision, imagination and above all the intelligence of their performers. Its like is seen in the Premiership only when Chelsea, Liverpool or Leeds United have a good day, when Arsenal are on song or when Manchester United are in full flow. So long as two-thirds of the Premiership are preoccupied with merely staying in it this is not going to change. </p> <p>The game played by teams seeking 40-odd points to avoid being relegated bears little resemblance to the game played to win international tournaments. And the higher the price for dropping out of the Premier League the more desperate the struggle to survive becomes. </p> <p>When Spurs sold David Ginola, a creator, to Aston Villa for \u00a33m, having bought Ben Thatcher, a destroyer, from Wimbledon for \u00a35m, they made a sombre statement about the realities of life in the Premiership's middle classes. Whether or not Ginola can tailor his game to the belt-and-braces approach of John Gregory remains to be seen. </p> <p>To give the football authorities credit, much has been done to improve the game, with Euro 2000 surely providing ultimate vindication of the decision to ban tackling from behind, while making it harder for defences to play the offside trap. </p> <p>The flow of matches was improved by the referees being allowed to use discretion over fouls and \"injuries\". Italy's Pierluigi Collina provided the David Ellerays and Mike Reeds with an outstanding example of how to control games using cards as a last, rather than a first resort. Pre-season jabs against yellow fever should be compulsory for English referees. </p> <p>The new season will see the introduction of rugby's 10-yard rule, which gives referees the power to move a free-kick forward 10 yards if there is dissent. Protesting players who jostle officials can expect a 12-match suspension and a fine of four weeks' wages, with a minimum 12-month ban for a second offence. </p> <p>The FA, conscious of the poor images presented by a number of incidents last season, is ready to fine clubs up to \u00a3250,000 if their players transgress or even dock them two league points. The stance is admirable provided Lancaster Gate can make it stick and not be intimidated by legal threats from the more litigious club chairmen. </p> <p>They, however, will have much else on their minds. The \u00a336m-plus transfers of Hernan Crespo to Lazio and Luis Figo to Real Madrid have taken the transfer market, along with salaries, into a new stratosphere and English clubs, the new television deal notwithstanding, are already feeling the effects of the fallout. </p> <p>Overmars and Petit, both essential to Arsenal's ambitions at home and abroad, have gone to Barcelona for a combined fee of \u00a330m. Sir Alex Ferguson has declared that neither Beckham nor Scholes will be leaving Old Trafford while he remains manager, but since Fergie plans to retire in two years' time that is not saying much. There are only so many offers that your average plc, with shareholders to think of, can refuse. </p> <p>Everton, meanwhile, have picked up Paul Gascoigne in a Middlesbrough boot sale. Is it really 10 years since the land echoed to the tears and cash registers of Gazzamania? </p> <p><strong>The new rules</strong><br></p> <p><strong> 10-yard rule: </strong> At a free-kick, if a player fails to retreat 10 yards, delays the restart, shows dissent or is guilty of unsporting behaviour for any other cautionable offence, his team will be penalised by having the kick advanced 10 yards towards their goal in addition to the player being cautioned. </p> <p><strong> Goalkeepers:</strong> The requirement to let go of the ball after four steps is replaced by a rule that demands the keeper release the ball within six seconds.

  "<p>In this historic Roman town, Stuart Law, in full armour, seemed to be moving with the assertive stride of a centurion towards a win that he had refused to accept might be inaccessible. </p> <p>As if mocking his side's daunting target of 348, he paraded a repertoire of bold attacking shots off a Gloucestershire range of bowlers that had rarely threatened Law's technical mastery and footwork. Then, just before the close, he was superbly held at slip by Martyn Ball off Ben Gannon. </p> <p>Law, who passed 1,000 runs for the season during his innings, had belted seven fours off 90 balls, never remotely inhibited by the balance of this match. Essex still need 207, a tall order. </p> <p>At his side was Paul Grayson, succeeding for the second time in this game. There was perhaps less flourish, less power and audacity. But his contribution to the stand had much merit, before he was out offering no stroke to Ball. </p> <p>There may be something appropriate about military medium at this garrison town. Alleyne's controlled pace, in fact, demanded more attention from Law than the new-ball bowlers, who, striving for speed, too often erred in length and direction. The predictions of sustained spin have not materialised. The ball rarely turned all day. </p> <p>If Gloucestershire had qualms about not enforcing the follow-on, their reservations may have increased when Tim Hancock was out to the fifth ball of the morning, parting company with his off-stump. In Ashley Cowan's next over, Alleyne was caught at slip. Cowan, dropped earlier this season, went on to take five wickets and also bowled Kim Barnett off a no-ball. </p> <p>Gloucestershire had done their calculations but these had not taken into account the early dismissals that threatened to dissipate the first- innings lead of 150. Barnett and Chris Taylor, old and young, redressed the anxieties. They searched for runs: Barnett punched through the covers and Taylor prettily angled his bat with assertive strokes that obscured his greenhorn status. </p> <p>But Taylor went immediately after lunch and Jack Russell soon followed. It had not been up to then a memorable match for batsmen - on the ground, after all, where Kent's Arthur Fagg once hit a double hundred in each innings. After Barnett spooned into the covers, it was left to Jeremy Snape, a batsman at his best when making crisp shots, and Ball, the off-spinner who fancies his batting. </p> <p>In again, Essex appeared to be facing an ascent more marked than the steep climb up to Colchester's famous museum and clock tower. It did not help when Paul Prichard failed for a second time, caught by Ball's ever-reliable hands at first slip.</p>",
  "<p> Australia and South Africa produced a repeat of their epic World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston last year when they tied the second of their three one-day internationals in Melbourne yesterday. </p> <p>The hosts looked to have the upper hand at the indoor Docklands stadium after restricting the South Africans to 226 for eight from 50 overs and then cruising to 164 for three. But the Proteas struck back as the world champions lost their next five wickets for just 50 runs to collapse to 214 for eight. </p> <p>With all their recognised batsmen departed, Australia needed 13 off the final over; they managed 12 and forced a tie when Shane Warne scrambled through for a single off the final ball. \"It's a fair indication of the closeness of the two sides,\" the Australian captain Steve Waugh said. \"We probably both thought we should have won the game so it was probably a fair result.\" </p> <p>After winning Wednesday's opening match of the three-game series by 94 runs with an imposing total of 295, the Australians seemed to be on target to clinch the series after the South African innings. </p> <p>Australia's fast bowler Jason Gillespie, in his second international following long-term injury, clean bowled Jacques Kallis for 22 in his first spell, then returned to pick up the wickets of the all-rounders Lance Klusener and Shaun Pollock to finish on three for 40. </p> <p>The part-timer bowlers Andrew Symonds and Ian Harvey both collected two wickets apiece as the visitors slumped to 95 for four before Jonty Rhodes and Mark Boucher rescued them with a fifth-wicket stand of 87. Rhodes top-scored with 54 despite batting with a runner after injuring his groin midway through his innings. Mark Boucher contributed 51 after being dropped by Michael Bevan on five. </p> <p>Bevan, who dislocated his finger dropping Boucher, was forced to pad-up after Australia's run chase went so badly awry. Klusener and the part-time medium-pacer Andrew Hall were the surprise heroes with Hall taking two for eight from three overs. </p> <p>Mark Waugh (48), Gilchrist (37) and Ricky Ponting (39) gave the home side the perfect start but no one was able to go on and make a big score. Steve Waugh hit a quick 30, including 14 off one Pollock over, before being bowled in the penultimate over, leaving Warne to chase the remaining 13 off the final over. </p> <p>Federal investigations in India into allegations of match-fixing are likely to end next month. \"They will most probably wind up the investigations by September 15,\" said AC Muthiah, president of the Indian board of control. \"That's what we want . . . otherwise the morale of the players is going down.\"</p>",
  "<p>Now is the time to bet on sport. The conditions have never been more favourable for making big money from punting on pastimes. At the track, you don't have to pay any tax. And if you bet with the spread betting firms the tax is included in the spread.</p> <p>This prudent Chancellor is happy for sensible sports investors to keep their winnings. Compare and contrast with those fools who invest in What.com and the like. They have to pay dealing costs and when they pick a winner shell out 40 per cent in capital gains tax. A fair and reasonable levy to restrain such reckless gambling.</p> <p> The differing treatment goes back to the courts being unwilling to sully their hands by dealing with filthy gambling disputes. 'Bets are legally unenforceable,' the judges decreed. And so it continued until the early Fifties when Churchill's government attempted to tax professional gamblers. Stupidly, they didn't ring-fence the provision to ensure that gambling losses could only be offset against gambling profits. Every butcher, baker and candlestick maker promptly claimed to be a pro gambler and set off their betting losses against the money they had made from meat, bread and wax. The government gave up. </p> <p>Since then, betting shops were allowed to open so long as they resembled Hades. And everything was fine until Black Monday when some young speculators managed to do all their dough and then some. The Footsie fell hundreds and hundreds of points and the whippersnappers lost hundreds and hundreds of times their money. Decision time for Their Lordships. It is traditionally argued that hard cases make bad law, but in truth it is when the judges' prejudices come into play that duff judgments are spouted. They hummed and they hawed. It looked like gambling but it was done on the stock exchange. So it couldn't be gambling because if it was then... then... everything would be gambling. And then they'd be in a pickle. </p> <p>To avoid such a fate they found that, despite all appearances to the contrary, the young guns hadn't been gambling, their debts were therefore enforceable and they should pay up promptly. They covered up this faulty logic by pointing out that the spread-betting firms were regulated by the Financial Services Act just like stockbrokers et al. Irrelevant, but sufficient. </p> <p>You might have thought that it would follow from this that monies made from spread betting should be subject to capital gains tax just like monies made from other activities regulated by the FSA. Not a bit of it. 'A lot of people ask me that if it's [a spread bet] enforceable then why isn't it subject to Capital Gains Tax?' says Stuart Wheeler, head of IG Index, grandfather of spread betting, professional bridge player, and all-round shrewdie. 'But there is no connection between the two. Nor is it likely that the bets will be subject to tax in the future because the idea of making people pay tax on any betting profits is not a popular one and certainly not an election winner.' </p> <p>The absence of CGT has saved Philip Peters, the star of Tuesday's edition of the much-improved Jackpot television series, a quarter of a million or so in tax because in the past five years he made \u00a3600,000 from spread betting. Peters' career has been picaresque. Here is his CV with, admittedly, somewhat sketchy dates: </p> <p><strong> 1958-1963:</strong> Regular employment. </p> <p><strong> 1963:</strong> Ceases regular employment. </p> <p><strong> 1964:</strong> Having raised his stake money betting on photo-finishes at Reading dogs, realises that good money can be made backing second favourites each-way when there is a long odds-on favourite. 'You'd be getting 6-4 against when it should be 3-1 on,' says Peters. </p> <p><strong> 1965-67:</strong> Works out way to make money on the Tote. 'When the bookies opened they would take any bet on anything and there was no minimum dividend. So if a dog was 8-1 on you'd get the same price for a place. There was nothing very clever about it.' </p> <p><strong> 1967-72:</strong> Refines system and becomes heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I was betting at Hastings dogs one afternoon and realised how little money was gambled on the place pool. It cost me very little to increase the minimum dividend and it worked very well.' </p> <p><strong> 1972-77:</strong> Becomes very heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I had 80 OAPs up and down the country working for me betting 12 of the straight forecast combinations off the track and we were betting the others at the track. We made a lot of money.' </p> <p><strong> 1982:</strong> Wife nags him into getting a proper job on grounds of 'status'. He invests in a company making plastic containers for then new-in-the-kitchen microwave ovens. Dumb move. 'I'm the only person I know who got all his money from gambling and lost it all in straight business.' </p> <p><strong> 1982-94:</strong> A bad dozen years. </p> <p><strong> 1994:</strong> Introduced to spread betting. 'All I had was three years' worth of Racing Posts .' </p> <p><strong> 1994-2000:</strong> Cleans up. </p> <p> He has made his money primarily from betting on the spreads offered on horse-race distances, but has also trousered tidy sums from betting on the bookings index and the corners index. On all three markets he has sold. His reasoning is simple. Most punters find it psychologically soothing for their downside to be limited and their upside to be unlimited. They know exactly how much they can lose and can dream about how much they might win. </p> <p>On the horse-race distances, about 19 out of 20 players would be buyers. Peters, a contrarian at heart, went the other way and turned nothing into \u00a3200,000. He has bad days - there have been a couple of \u00a340,000 losses - but most days are good. He has used the same principles to win on corners and bookings. He has made healthy profits by taking the 'uncomfortable position' where you win a little often and lose a lot rarely and come out on top.</p> <p> On the bookings index, in particular, he has been helped by the usual tabloid hype about card-crazy referees. The punters, whipped into a frenzy as effectively as Rebekah Wade inciting the unthinking majority, can't help themselves and buy away. The market is distorted. As Toby Brereton, chief market-maker at IG Index, says: 'Opposing hype is an extremely good tool for any bettor.' The latest market to attract the Peters Principle has been the time of Premiership goals. The spread makers have underestimated the number of goals in a match and therefore gone too high on the time of the opening goal. Once again, he has been selling and winning as the foolish crowd buy in the hope of that elusive big win.</p>"
