  "<p><strong> Excentricus</strong><br> Barbican, London ****  </p> <p>Transformed since it was first seen in Edinburgh last year, Cirque Eloize's circus piece, Excentricus, is now the show it always strove to be: a playful celebration of love and life. It is laced with the abandon of flying on a trapeze, the tears of the clown and the control and improbable grace of eight people riding a bicycle. </p> <p>Excentricus still has a tendency toward soft rock and hazy rainbows, but the performers inhabit their characters and interact with each other like actors and dancers. They take circus beyond the confines of mere feat and into the realm of meaning. </p> <p>The stage approximates the village square: at times there is hustle and bustle; at others individual stories are played out on the rope, the ladder and the trapeze. There are wheels within wheels at work here, quite literally when it comes to bicycles. Cirque Eloize may not be able to match the Chinese State Circus's 14 on a bicycle but they convey infinitely more astonished pleasure at their own virtuosity </p> <p>The show features the slightly sinister ring master figure, the hunky village show-off who performs his floor acrobatics to the crowd as if advertising what he would be like in bed, and the scrawny runt of the litter whose feelings of rejection turn the rope into an act of suicide. But the whole thing is glued together by Jamie Adkins's bashful village idiot, who doesn't miss a trick. It is like watching Michael Crawford's character Frank from Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em trying to walk the high wire and, to his amazement, succeeding. </p> <p>There is the odd moment, particularly at the beginning, when it is all a little fey, but this is an immensely engaging circus show and a treat for young and old alike. </p> <p>\u0095 Until September 2.

  "<p>A Court of Appeal decision last month has closed a loophole which Standard Life tried to exploit after mis-selling a pension, writes Richard Colbey. The decision will make it harder for pension and life assurance companies to escape liability when they do get things wrong. </p> <p>Lesley Gorham's husband was sold a pension by Standard Life in January 1992. He was working for BT, and would have been far better off in its occupational pension scheme. </p> <p>This was particularly the case as he had told the salesman that his first priority was providing for his family, and the occupational pension had a generous benefit should he die prematurely. When Standard Life reviewed his pension in November 1992, it realised the mistake and advised him to switch to the BT scheme. Unfortunately, though, effecting that switch was something Mr Gorham never got around to doing, and he died in September 1994, leaving two young children. </p> <p>If he had been a member of the BT scheme for two years before his death, his family would have been entitled to benefits worth around \u00a377,000. This was in addition to a substantial sum they would have received even if he had only joined when he was advised to in November 1992. </p> <p> Of course, as he had not been in the scheme at all they missed out on these altogether. In court, Standard Life accepted that the advice it had given was negligent and that it had had a duty not to sell him one of its pensions. But it still argued that Mrs Gorham should not receive any compensation, claiming that as its contract had been with Mr Gorham, only he should have the right to take action for breach of it. </p> <p>This argument will not sound very attractive to the pension-buying public, who do not expect negligent institutions to be able to rely on technicalities to escape liability. Even if the argument were legally valid, a mutual body supposedly run for the benefit of its members, might have been expected to pay out anyway. </p> <p>Standard Life also argued that in any case compensation should be restricted to the \u00a377,000, and not the additional sums Mrs Gorham would have received had her husband followed its advice and switched schemes in November 1994. The Court of Appeal decided, by a majority of two to one, that her claim was restricted to that sum, that the further losses had been caused by Mr Gorham's own fault in not switching. </p> <p>However, the Court had no difficulty in deciding that the \u00a377,000 had to be paid, despite Standard Life's claim that there was nothing in the Financial Services Act or any of the Act's Codes that gave third parties the right to compensation. </p> <p>The life assurance industry so often makes the assumption that this legislation provides the entire basis for its liability, that it was reassuring to see the Court of Appeal remind it that it is also subject to the common law. </p> <p>The court considered a 1995 decision in a claim brought by Carol White, who would have benefited had her father's will been finalised. She was able to recover compensation from the solicitors who had been instructed to draft the will but never quite got around to it before he died. </p> <p>There the House of Lords considered there was no reason for not saying the solicitors owed her a duty to act properly: she was going to lose out if they didn't. </p> <p>The Court of Appeal considered that there was no reason to distinguish between Mrs White's situation and Mrs Gorham's. Lord Justice Pill said \"practical justice\" required beneficiaries under pension schemes to have rights when things went wrong. </p> <p>A spokesman for Standard Life said that it would have let Mrs Gorham keep the \u00a377,000 even if it had succeeded in the Court of Appeal. However, that does not alter the fact that at the first court hearing it was aiming to deprive her of everything. The episode will have cost the company more in legal fees than it paid out to Mrs Gorham. </p> <p> Richard Colbey is a barrister.</p>",
  "<p>As the house price boom shows its first signs of cracking, top of the market purchasers must now hope that the relative optimism of property commentators is not misplaced. </p> <p>For there are still many victims of previous home price booms and busts around, all reminders of what could happen if the \"buyers turning their backs on the housing market in July\" - revealed by this week's Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors research - turns into a rout. </p> <p>But many of those who lost out in the frantic housing market of the late 80s and early 90s might now find they have greater muscle against the debt collectors who are still harrassing them for shortfall debts: the difference between the price achieved on a repossession sale and what they borrowed, plus interest and other costs. </p> <p>For today, despite claims from the home loans industry that repossessed properties are always sold at the very best prices achievable, Jobs &amp; Money can expose how bosses at one top home loan company ordered staff to sell off \"homes in possession\" at potentially knockdown prices. It is an admission that will add fuel to the controversy over the way mortgage firms and debt chasers deal with ex-customers who have lost homes. </p> <p>And Jobs &amp; Money can also reveal how the same big mortgage company conceded it had been lending on low quality criteria - in other words, it had encouraged people to stretch resources to breaking point with loans which they might not be able to repay if interest rates rose or their earnings fell. </p> <p>Taken together, our revelations - and there is little doubt that they applied to many lenders - could lead to new legal clashes between mortgage companies and former customers whom they are now chasing for arrears and shortfall payments. Customers may be able to claim they were misled and mis-sold. </p> <p>Confidential memos show that branch managers at a major home loan company were told to sell repossessed properties at ultra-low prices to get them off the books. </p> <p>One of the main complaints of repossession victims has been the low price received for their former properties when they were sold - often to professional bargain hunters at auctions. This shortfall has exacerbated the arrears - and made them doubly difficult to bear once interest is added to the loss. </p> <p>Mortgage companies have always maintained the prices they obtained on repossessions were fair market prices. </p> <p>Internal documents and memos from Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, dating from the 80s when it was still a mutually owned building society - it is now part of the Lloyds TSB empire - show it was already worried about repossessions in 1985. They were, of course, to get far worse over the following decade. </p> <p>In that year, around 1,400 C&amp;G-financed homes were seized - and that was almost 15 times higher than in 1982. Financial losses were also mounting fast, although mortgage indemnity guarantee insurers paid most of the deficit. Many of those still being chased for arrears first took out 25-year loans in the 80s. </p> <p>Then managing director Andrew Longhurst decided on a two-pronged attack. He ordered branch managers to get rid of repossessed properties as soon as possible - taking a loss where necessary, even though house prices were rising at the time - and to improve lending quality. </p> <p>He wrote to managers: \"You must devote <strong> all</strong> your time and energy to disposing of properties in possession - and avoiding new ones. This is your <strong> Number 1 priority</strong>.\" </p> <p>A second September 1985 memo from then assistant general manager Roger Malvern ordered that: </p> <p>\u0095 All properties taken into possession are in future to be sold within three months; </p> <p>\u0095 Branches to accept offers within 10% of valuation; </p> <p>\u0095 Agents must market properties labelled \"Finance Company Re-Possession - offers around \u00a3XXXXXX\". Offers lower than that had to be referred to the society's arrears department. </p> <p>All of these points - which would have been similar to criteria used by other lenders for the following decade or so - affect the amount repossessed properties fetched and ensure that those who lost their properties would have to pay more when the eventual shortfall bills were sent out, often several years after the keys had been handed in. </p> <p>Selling properties quickly tends to depress prices - buyers know they are in a strong position. </p> <p>Accepting a 10% cut gives \u00a345,000 for a property worth \u00a350,000 and produces a \u00a35,000 shortfall. This could easily turn into a debt of \u00a325,000 over eight to 10 years with interest and other charges. </p> <p>And labelling homes as repossessions gives a further turn on the screw - buyers know it is a desperation sale. </p> <p>The second part of the C&amp;G loss control plan was to improve lending quality. Longhurst told managers: \"In recent years you have been urged to lend as much as you can, but you have never been urged to lend on rubbish or to rubbish.\" </p> <p>He called for \"a more careful consideration of each and every new mortgage application\". C&amp;G made major changes in the way it deals with repossession properties in 1994. It says: \"Our policy is to obtain the best possible sales price. We obtain two professional valuations and a selling agent's appraisal and set an initial asking price based on their average. </p> <p>\"Selling agents are instructed <strong> not</strong> to advertise the property as a repossession as this could be in conflict with our duty of care to obtain the best price. </p> <p>\"Once an offer is accepted, we advertise the property in a local newspaper in case there are higher bids and our agents continue to market the property until contracts are exchanged. We sell 95% of repossessions through estate agents rather than auctions. But even in auctions, we set a reserve price based on our valuations.\" </p> <p>The C&amp;G was not alone in less-than-totally prudent lending in the 80s. Abbey National lent \u00a374,500 in the late 80s to a customer earning around \u00a311,000 a year - nearly seven times his annual income instead of the more normal three times. </p> <p>Terry Harborne, now 33, set up a cleaning company employing 60 part-timers in 1989. One of his contracts was to clean the Abbey National branch in West Ealing, London. </p> <p>Staff there discovered that Terry was paying \u00a3400 a month in rent. They told him this could fund a \u00a375,000 mortgage. \"I just did what they said. As I was self-employed, I should have had three years' audited accounts but they ignored that. They did the whole thing on my VAT registration and the VAT threshold was then \u00a325,000.\" </p> <p>But Abbey's staff misunderstood how VAT worked. The \u00a325,000 figure is turnover, not profit - his annual earnings were \u00a311,000. </p> <p>Harborne only lived in his \u00a374,500 Wandsworth, London house for a month. \"I gave back the keys. I was blacklisted for credit - I couldn't even get a bank account.\" </p> <p>In 1997, the Abbey sent him a bill for \u00a345,036, but after Harborne advertised his plight on his own website, Abbey settled for \u00a33,500. </p> <p>Recently, some mortgage brokers and lenders have been offering up to five times salary - rather than the more prudent 3.25 times as borrowers geared up to meet fast rising property prices. And this has led to fears that repossessions and shortfalls could all happen again to a new generation of borrowers.</p> <p><strong>Repossessed: The college lecturer </strong> <br></p> <p>The Archaeology lecturer Eleanor Scott paid \u00a318,500 for a Newcastle flat in 1991. When it was sold as a repossession, it fetched just \u00a31,300. Now she wants the lenders to admit it should not have lent her the money as the valuation surveyor failed to put a fair value on the property. </p> <p>Dr Scott borrowed \u00a316,500 from National &amp; Provincial Building Society - now part of Abbey National. Two years later, on leaving the property, she realised prices had fallen, but N &amp; P would not allow her to sell privately at a loss as this would deprive it of a claim under its mortgage indemnity guarantee policy. </p> <p>She failed in an attempt to rent the property - and being in a less desirable area of Newcastle, it was damaged by substantial vandalism while it stood empty. </p> <p>In 1995, the N &amp; P wrote to her - several months after she had contacted them - with a Voluntary Possession Form. The lender assured her it \"would start to actively market the property to obtain the best market value advised by two independent estate agents.\" </p> <p>When sold at auction the flat fetched just \u00a31,300. The Abbey eventually asked her for \u00a316,991 in shortfall via solicitors Eversheds. After she wrote to Abbey National chief executive Ian Harley, the bank cut its demand to \u00a37,000. </p> <p>But Dr Scott, who now lives in Hampshire, cannot afford this either on her part-time salary. </p> <p>She says: \"I relied on the valuation surveyor the N &amp; P used. Surely if it was worth far less than what I paid, the surveyor should have turned down the loan. After all, it is their security that is at risk and the money of their savers.\" </p> <p>But although the valuation survey is paid for by the home buyer, it belongs to the lender. It is only more recently that lenders have agreed to let borrowers see this document if they ask to do so.</p>",
  "<p>Every Saturday night, the amateur Frank Sinatras in my local pub find it impossible to resist the temptation to over-act their way through My Way. </p> <p>And the line that gets the biggest response is when the singers scrunch their faces and belt out \"Regreeaaats, I've had a feeeeew... \"</p> <p>Maybe it's that type of pub - old men brooding over pints - but that regret goes down a storm every week. But I have a fantasy: one day someone is going to disrupt this OAP karaoke by singing Je Ne Regrette Rien, and they'll be jeered off by a hard core of regretters gathered around the makeshift stage.</p> <p>Fights might break out between the Regret Nothing crowd and the resident Regret Everything crew.</p> <p>For a reason I can't quite explain, I was reminded of these regretful drinkers when I saw a naff cable television advert for life insurance. The thrust of the advert was that none of us are getting any younger and any of us could be hit by a bus tomorrow and we wouldn't want to be left regretting that we'd made no provision for those left behind.</p> <p>But the flaw in this hit-by-a-bus scenario is that it always assumes that the Grim Reaper is at the wheel and that there are no loose ends left untied; we're dead, the insurance pays out and our carefully prepared will allocates our worldly possessions to our loved ones.</p> <p>But life is full of loose ends, and what isn't explained is what happens if the bus doesn't leave us dead, but so badly incapacitated that we're unlikely to be able to handle our own finances again. There might be critical illness cover in the insurance for our relatives, but the biggie financial question is who is going to take charge of handling the rest of our money. If we were dead, an executor would step in. But if you're alive, who can take charge of your bank accounts, credit cards, shares and anything else that's only in your name?</p> <p>Less melodramatically than being hit by a bus, ours is an ageing population, which means many more people will have relatives who at some point will no longer be able to look after their own finances.</p> <p>Even though someone's health might have failed, there are still bills to be paid, repayments to be kept up, bank accounts to be checked and decisions to be made on their behalf over savings and investments. If you're incapacitated and in long-term care, who's going to sign the cheques or collect any money that's owed to you?</p> <p>The person who can intervene in such circumstances is given what is known as the \"enduring powers of attorney\". And, back to our regrets, this person, who might be a friend, relative or someone else you trust, has to be appointed before the bus hits you. It means that you grant someone else a kind of financial guardian status, where the attorney can sign cheques, move money in and out of accounts and act in whatever they believe to be your best interests.</p> <p>\"Everyone should consider arranging an attorney, as you never know what might happen. The alternative can be a lengthy and expensive application to the Court of Protection to allow a supervised individual to act on your behalf. Preparing for an attorney in advance allows people to make their own choice as to who they want to deal with their financial affairs, should they become mentally incapable of looking after them themselves,\" says Jan Wright, a solicitor who specialises in this area at Radcliffes law firm in Westminster.</p> <p>Nominating your chosen attorney involves filling in an official document, probably with the advice of a solicitor. This can grant almost unlimited power over your financial affairs or can be limited to specific areas. Either way, the powers can't kick in until you've lost your powers of reasoning and the appointed person registers their Enduring Power of Attorney with the Public Trust Office.</p> <p>Registration (which costs a \u00a350 fee) also requires the attorney to inform at least three relatives of the person concerned that they are taking on these powers (usually carried out unsupervised and without the obligation to keep accounts), with relatives having the right to make a legal challenge to the appointment.</p> <p>Last year there were 12,000 registrations of attorneys, and with the anticipated increase in longevity and the illnesses associated with it, there could be many more people needing to find someone able to take up the financial reins on their behalf. And as the pub Sinatras might say, choosing your own pre-death executor will help you to do it your way.</p> <p>\u0095 Public Trust Office, Protection Division, Stewart House, 24 Kingsway, London WC2B 6JX.</p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The number of unnecessary red cards shown since the start of the Premiership season has really disappointed me. It robs the paying public, may have a bearing on the championship and needs to be sorted out now. To my mind a new three-card system would be a good start. </p> <p>The idea is straightforward. A red-card offence would remain an automatic dismissal but the bookings law would be more flexible. A player cautioned twice would not be sent off but instead would serve an automatic one-match ban. Only after three yellow cards would the red follow. </p> <p>That gives players breathing space, means the fans are not cheated out of seeing 11 v 11 so often and yet at the same time ensures offenders do not get off scot-free. Crucially, it also gives managers a chance to reassess. </p> <p>Once a player reaches two bookings the manager could either haul him off, if he has not used his substitutes, or run the risk of a third card. At the moment players can end up on sudden death after they mistime a sliding tackle in the wet in the first minute. </p> <p>Unfortunately, I don't imagine the Football Association will adopt that idea this season. In fact, I'll plait sawdust if it does. But there could and should be a meeting involving representatives of referees, managers, players and the FA to discuss what is going on. Why not televise it and get everything out in the open? Let's make sure everyone is clear about what is allowed and what is not. </p> <p>I must stress at this point that referees are right an awful lot more often than the players are. But mistakes happen, as Graham Poll was honest enough to admit over his sending-off of Dietmar Hamann at Highbury, and I would favour a panel to assess some decisions. </p> <p>I had first-hand experience of that in Spain when I was in charge of Atletico Madrid, and particularly remember one case after a game against Real Madrid. Their keeper made some dreadful challenges in one-on-ones, reminiscent of Harald Schumacher's on Patrick Battiston in the 1982 World Cup, but was only booked, whereas we had two sent off. After the committee had examined what went on, my players escaped a suspension and Real's keeper got a nine-match ban. </p> <p>If I was on a panel I would certainly have called for several of this season's red cards to be overturned. Roy Keane's dismissal in the Charity Shield was spot on - we want those tackles out of the game - but everyone could have stayed on at Arsenal on Monday and Patrick Vieira should not have been sent off at Sunderland. </p> <p>In that incident Vieira was being tugged back and was just trying to shake Darren Williams off; he wasn't trying to knock his head off. Referees need to take into account more that it's a game of dispute and competition. They also need to use greater man-management. Perhaps they could sit down with senior pros or players who have just retired and go through videos, examining what is dangerous and what is not. </p> <p>There is definitely a case for former players being fast-tracked into refereeing, and of all the incidents this week I was particularly fascinated to see Ars\u00e8ne Wenger charged by the FA with \"threatening behaviour and physical intimidation\" at Sunderland. Let's be honest, he's the last person you would have in that category. </p> <p>I've seen referees fronted up in tunnels and remarks thrown for them to hear. There have also been isolated incidents such as Ian Wright bursting into the referee's room. But the relationship between refs and the players and managers has clearly deteriorated and cannot afford a greater split without real resentment festering. </p> <p> Referees are more and more becoming personalities and the old camaraderie and respect have been replaced by a feeling of \"them and us\". </p> <p>As a manager I invited referees for a drink after the game. I had Keith Cooper singing in my office after one match, but he gave a penalty against us in the first minute the next time we met so he clearly wasn't doing us any favours. Somehow I can't imagine referees serenading any Premiership managers tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>\"Let me start by saying how pleased I was to be asked to deliver the MacTaggart lecture in this the 25th year of the Edinburgh International Television Festival. </p> <p> I wasn't here for the first few years but I have been coming on and off for most of the Festival's existence. </p> <p> Three things have changed fundamentally since those early days. Firstly the size and professionalism of the festival has changed beyond recognition. </p> <p> Secondly the price of hotels in Edinburgh for this particular weekend have gone through the roof. </p> <p> Finally, and the biggest change of all, my friend Gus MacDonald has gone from being a radical programme maker with strong far left credentials to become Lord MacDonald of Tradeston. </p> <p> Gus, 25 years ago the only thing less likely than me becoming Director-General of the BBC was you agreeing to become a member of the House of Lords. </p> <p> Actually I'm the first ever Director-General never to have worked for the BBC before taking on the role. I only ever applied for two jobs at the BBC - the first in 1970 as a reporter on Radio Teeside, which I failed to get, and the second nearly 30 years later as Director-General. </p> <p> I am also flattered to be the first person ever to deliver the MacTaggart lecture twice, although there is one big drawback to that. I used all my best jokes the first time. So forgive me if my lecture here tonight is unremittingly serious and I realise that as a result, some will think that I've gone completely native after less than a year at the BBC. </p> <p> In 1994, my lecture was about broadcasting and politics. My concern then was that the relationship between Government and broadcasters was in danger of becoming unhealthy; that as the world of broadcasting was changing broadcasters were always wanting something from the Government and, as such, were less likely to be brave in their programming when standing up to the Government of the day. </p> <p> I still have that concern - in fact the danger has grown. Broadcasters today want more from Government than we could possibly have imagined just six years ago. That is why the Government's decision to give the BBC a seven year licence fee agreement, right through to the end of the current BBC Charter, is important. It gives the BBC the freedom and independence to be brave. </p> <p> However we all still need to be vigilant in the area of political independence and I am particularly concerned when I read of proposals for a single content regulator across the whole television industry. </p> <p> I believe we have a far better chance of resisting political pressure if, between us, we have more than one content regulator. Pluralism in regulation is as important as pluralism among broadcasters. </p> <p> But tonight I don't plan to talk about politics, I want to talk about change and why it is difficult to bring about in an organisation like the BBC. </p> <p> The Council Chamber in Broadcasting House at the BBC is an austere place where the windows are set so high that no one can see in or out. If you believe that is symbolic, beware - our new boardroom has no windows at all. </p> <p> As you go into the Council Chamber you will find something equally symbolic - the portraits of previous Directors-General hang on the walls around you to serve as a constant reminder of the BBC's heritage. </p> <p> In the spot above the mantelpiece, pride of place rightly goes to the BBC's founder, John Reith. The second best spot, directly opposite him, is taken by Hugh Carleton Greene. These are seen by many as the two truly great Directors-General. </p> <p> Now, the myth of the BBC is that there is a single flame, a single idea handed seamlessly from generation to generation. The flame is public service broadcasting and each generation understands its inheritance and fights not to change it but to defend it to the death. Having the previous Directors-General looking down upon you is no doubt intended to remind you that you tamper with it at your peril. </p> <p><strong>Echoes of the past</strong></p> <p> The truth, of course, is very different. John Reith - on your right as you walk into the Council Chamber - ended up disliking Greene, on the left, with an intense passion. Reith's view was that Greene had trivialised his great institution; that Greene had - dare I use the words - \"dumbed down\" the BBC. As Reith put it when talking about Greene, \"I lead, he follows the crowd in all the disgusting manifestations of the age\u00bf Without any reservation he gives the public what it wants; I would not, did not and said I wouldn't. I am very annoyed that I even got on to terms with him\". </p> <p> In fact, many of the changes attributed to Greene had actually been started by his predecessor Sir Ian Jacob. Reith's views of Jacob were similar to his views of Greene. When he heard Jacob's portrait was going to be hung in the Council Chamber, Reith was so angry that he demanded that his own portrait be removed. </p> <p> What had Jacob and Greene actually done to so upset the BBC's founder? The story is very illuminating. </p> <p> Under Jacob, Greene had been Director of News and Current Affairs and had set about introducing radical change. </p> <p> In the mid-fifties the great joke about BBC News was that every newsreel would begin, \"The Queen Mother yesterday\u00bf\". I do, of course, realise that I am on dangerous ground when talking of the Queen Mother, but I'll take the risk. </p> <p> Back to the joke. All newsreels started \"The Queen Mother yesterday\". The Queen Mother because everyone loved the Queen Mother; and yesterday because it took the BBC at least a day to check with the Queen Mother that she had done what she was said to have done, even though they had film of her doing it. </p> <p> Greene set about changing the whole journalistic ethos of the BBC, transforming a largely obsequious and deferential institution into a gritty news organisation that could respond swiftly and imaginatively. At the heart of the changes were two extremely controversial views, though: firstly that television not newspapers would prove to be the bedrock of news reporting in the future; and secondly that news and current affairs had to be less isolated from the rest of the BBC.</p> <p><strong>ITV on the scene</strong></p> <p> It was out of these twin beliefs that truly ground-breaking genre-defying programmes like Cathy Come Home were later to spring. </p> <p> After two years running News and Current Affairs, Greene became Director-General in 1960 at a time of real turmoil in the industry. Interestingly on becoming Director-General one of Greene's first actions was to move the nine o'clock news on the old Home Service, now Radio Four, to ten o'clock. You will not be surprised to know that the decision was ferociously attacked at the time. </p> <p> By 1960 BBC Television was in real trouble. ITV had come into existence in 1954 and after a difficult start was making life very hard for the BBC. BBC Television's share had gone from 100% to 34% in only six years, and remember this was still only a two channel world. </p> <p> With quiz programmes like Double Your Money, Take Your Pick and a raft of popular American series, ITV was stealing the hearts and minds of British viewers. Meanwhile BBC Television, obsessed with its own importance, was inward looking and hardly seemed to notice what was going on. </p> <p> Jacob and Greene set about changing this. For the first time British audiences were to be offered a diet of programming that was both challenging and popular, programmes like Play for Today, Z Cars, The Forsyte Saga, That Was the Week That Was, Til Death Us Do Part, Doctor Who, Monty Python's Flying Circus and literally dozens of others. </p> <p> It wasn't that Greene produced these programmes, of course he didn't. But he did make them possible. He gave BBC producers the ambition to make popular quality programming for the first time - programmes which both appealed to large audiences and made a difference to their lives. In rating terms, the BBC made a great recovery which left ITV with no option but to follow the BBC's lead, effectively making Greene the founder of modern day British television. </p> <p><strong>Radio reforms</strong></p> <p> And it didn't end with television either. When Radio Caroline and other pirate stations started broadcasting under a Panamanian flag of convenience in 1964 he not only argued that they should be closed down, but along with Frank Gillard, his legendary head of radio, he put in place the now familiar pattern of Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. Imagine the fuss that caused. </p> <p> Greene and Gillard's reforms of radio and television brought cries of derision. A Times leader accused the BBC of \"abandoning their role as the sponsors and protectors of quality broadcasting\". </p> <p> Even the now seemingly innocuous Z Cars received its fair share of condemnation. The Chief Constable of Lancashire, Colonel Eric St Johnstone, demanded that it be cancelled. His force, to a man, he complained, were full of disgust. </p> <p> Mary Whitehouse complained about the spate of modern plays on the BBC: \"We are told that the dramatists are portraying real life, but why concentrate on the kitchen sink when there are so many pleasant sitting rooms?\" No wonder she said of Greene: \"If you were to ask me who, above all, was responsible for the moral collapse which characterised the Sixties and Seventies, I would unhesitatingly name Sir Hugh Carleton Greene.\" </p> <p> Outrage from journalists, politicians, the great and the good and even some of the BBC's own staff at any mooted change in BBC radio or television is a pattern you can find throughout the history of the BBC. </p> <p> Just look at the last decade - changes within all of our memories. Remember the fuss and outrage when Matthew Bannister re-shaped and effectively re-invented Radio 1 in the mid Nineties? Yet Radio 1 is now seen as one of the great success stories of the BBC. </p> <p> Remember the fuss when the BBC created Radio Five Live with the idea of starting a radio station aimed at a younger audience and based around news and sport? Today Five Live is supreme in its field and its audience is still growing rapidly year by year. </p> <p> Remember when John Birt set up BBC Online? He was widely accused of wasting licence payers' money and yet now it is the most visited content site in Europe and widely loved by some of the very people who accused him of wasting money at the time. </p> <p><strong>Populism</strong></p> <p> Long before any of these recent examples, a few of you may remember Grace Archer's death in the Archers - which just happened to coincide with the opening night of ITV. It was greeted by Denis Pitts in the Daily Herald with the following denunciation: \"The BBC went too far on Thursday when, for the sake of a stunt, they killed off Grace Archer. The stunt was mean, callous and cold-blooded. I accuse the BBC of a shabby trick which has left an unpleasant taste in nine million mouths. I am angry. So is my wife.\" </p> <p> You have to wonder what his wife would have thought about EastEnders. </p> <p> In the sixties the opponents of change and in particular Greene's style of populism were everywhere. We now see Steptoe and Son as the great turning point in British situation comedy, a seminal series which helped pave the way for Dad's Army, 'Til Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and many others. But it wasn't always perceived as that. </p> <p> Wilfrid Brambell - the Shakespearean actor who played Steptoe senior said at the time: \"I suppose every actor has to get into dustbin drama sooner or later\". </p> <p> One wonders if anyone today would ever have heard of Brambell if he hadn't got into \"dustbin drama\" - I rather doubt it. </p> <p> None of this is new. As the BBC's Chief Archivist described it to me, \"The BBC has been accused of dumbing down from the day Reith invented it.\" Propose any significant change and the BBC is accused of betraying its heritage. </p> <p> The point is that the real genius of the BBC is that it has adapted and changed over the years. Successive generations of leaders have not simply taken the flame of public service broadcasting as a whole and passed it on unchanged. At crucial times in the BBC's history they have recognised that change was essential and have taken the bold decision to introduce it despite loud protests from all around them. </p> <p> By and large history has rewarded their courage and their detractors have been forgotten. No Director-General was more criticised than Greene and yet today his memory is revered - without Greene there would not be the BBC as we know it. Reith invented the BBC for one age. Greene re-invented it for another. </p> <p> <strong>John Birt </strong></p> <p> Of course it's pretty obvious why there are so many howls when anyone wants to change even comparatively small parts of the BBC. </p> <p> It was Machiavelli, when writing The Prince, who summed it up when he wrote: \"There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system. </p> <p> \"For the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institutions and merely lukewarm defenders in those who would gain by the new.\" </p> <p> Oddly when I looked up that quote in my files written on the same sheet was one which is less philosophical but equally applicable. It was from the former French President General De Gaulle who said, \"Never stand between the dog and the lamp post.\" </p> <p> So given this history, why try to change the BBC? </p> <p> Look at the venom directed at John Birt - the man who had the courage to start the modernisation process at the BBC. </p> <p> Why be radical in an age when attacks from sections of the press are more vicious and more personal than ever before; when the BBC's commercial competitors are more ruthless than they have ever been; and when some politicians and commentators seem more interested in quick headlines than in trying to understand the real issues? </p> <p> The answer, of course, is we have no option. I believe the stark choice facing the BBC today is that we either change or we simply manage decline gracefully and none of us joined the BBC to do that. </p> <p> <strong>Digital TV </strong></p> <p> The changes happening in technology; in the wider society; and in our competitive environment are what make this one of those times in history when change at the BBC is essential. </p> <p> Let's take technology first. Digital television, and with it as many as 160 channels in digital satellite homes, has arrived at a pace faster than any could have imagined, certainly faster than I anticipated when I gave this lecture six years ago. </p> <p> But we are only just beginning to see what digital television can really bring. Electronic programme guides are already changing viewing habits in digital homes dramatically, but the real revolution will come with the arrival of the TiVo box and similar in-home, hard disc recording technologies which will give the consumer complete freedom to watch what they want, when they want it. </p> <p> I still believe there will be a role for conventional channels by the end of this decade - at times people will still want informed selection - but the channels are likely to be more focused, and aimed either at particular audience groups or based on particular programme genres. </p> <p> <strong>Changing society </strong></p> <p> Secondly society is changing. Huge gulfs have opened up in the attitudes and values of different generations in a way not seen before.</p> <p> In recent research people from different age groups were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement, \"There is too much sex, bad language and violence on TV and in cinema today.\" Amongst the over 45's 72% said they agreed. Amongst the 25 to 34 year olds 79% disagreed. </p> <p> This dramatic polarisation of views creates real challenges for programme makers, broadcasters and regulators alike, particularly in the areas of taste and decency. </p> <p> The people brought up in the Thatcher age are the biggest challenge of all whether you're a politician, the Chief Executive of Marks and Spencer or a television executive. </p> <p> For these are the children of the multichannel age, they are used to choice and love it - whether it's shopping, music or television and they are certainly not deferential to Britain's traditional institutions like the BBC. </p> <p> This generation doesn't complain if they don't like our schedules they simply turn over. \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" is disappearing and being replaced by \"Not bothered of Newcastle\". </p> <p> And as the retiring speaker of the House of Commons reminded us recently this is also a generation with very little interest in conventional politics. </p> <p> However what we know is that they are passionate about many of the important issues of our times, they just don't think Westminster politics can provide the answers. </p> <p> <strong> Competition </strong></p> <p> I believe this will become an increasingly serious problem for broadcasters and programme-makers steeped in a tradition of reporting conventional politics. </p> <p> If the BBC is to stay relevant over this decade we have to understand this generation and meet their needs, not only because they matter, but because we are all being influenced by them. In the old days kids wanted to be like their parents. These days parents, terrified of growing old, want to be more like their kids. </p> <p> As Bob Dylan wrote \"I was so much older then I'm younger than that now.\" </p> <p> The third reason the BBC has to change is that the BBC's competitive environment has changed and will be transformed beyond recognition in the next decade. Consolidation and merger are the order of the day amongst media companies. </p> <p> Our competitors today are bigger, richer and more ruthless than at any time in the BBC's history. They are increasingly part of a global media industry which has access to vast capital funds. This is competition on a scale the BBC has never seen before. </p> <p> It's this combination of factors which mean that this is one of those periods when the BBC, and BBC Television in particular, has to go through fundamental change. In the words of Margaret Thatcher, \"there is no alternative\". </p> <p> Inside the BBC we have been discussing the changes we need to make to our television channels since I first took over, as no doubt many of you have read in Broadcast and elsewhere. </p> <p> One thing I have discovered in that time is that there is no such thing as a confidential debate in the BBC, but if a few headlines are the price you pay for an open and questioning environment it is a price worth paying. </p> <p> At the BBC we all recognise that changing anything is difficult to achieve without controversy. But no-one feels this more keenly than our new Director of Television Mark Thompson who went to make the keynote speech at the Banff festival in Canada a couple of months ago. </p> <p> Mark took the opportunity to outline some ideas about the future of our television services in an intelligent and thought provoking speech. He opened the debate. </p> <p> Within days the forces of darkness came down upon him. He was accused of being a philistine with plans to turn BBC One into an all entertainment channel, which he didn't say and is not true, and relegating all serious programming to the fringes, again which he didn't say and is not true. </p> <p> It was all familiar stuff. Predictably the retired old men of the BBC came out in force to defend yesterday as they always have done and always will. Had they read the speech? I doubt it. Did they understand the arguments? Unlikely. They just want television the way it was in their day. But that simply isn't an option. </p> <p> <strong>New plans</strong></p> <p> So what are the changes we plan to make? </p> <p> Well one of the dangers of making this speech here today is, as our Head of Press said to me, I'm bound to disappoint. He told me \"people are expecting you to be Moses coming down from the mountain with tablets of stone\". </p> <p> Of course Moses had it easy - he only had to carry the stone, someone else had already worked out the messages. </p> <p> Let me make it clear, I haven't come here today with all the answers, there are no new Ten Commandments. </p> <p> What we do have are some exciting ideas for the future of BBC Television in the first decade of a new century which also happens to be the first decade of the digital age. Like all ideas some will succeed and others won't but that doesn't matter, this is only the start of a journey, the process of change is ongoing. </p> <p> Let me explain our plans in three parts. </p> <p> First of all I want to talk about money and what the BBC can and cannot afford to do. </p> <p> Secondly I'd like to talk about our proposals for a portfolio of BBC public service channels, which will eventually be available in every home in Britain. </p> <p> And finally I want to talk about the purpose of the BBC and public service broadcasting in the digital age. </p> <p> <strong>Money matters </strong></p> <p> Starting with the money then. One thing I have learned in my years in the television industry is that money matters when you're trying to make outstanding programmes. It's not enough on its own - at some time or other most of us have spent a lot of money producing a very average programme - but trying to make fantastic programmes without the right budget is incredibly difficult. </p> <p> In fact I believe one of the problems of BBC Television today is that too many of our services have been under funded. </p> <p> BBC One certainly needs more money, particularly for drama and quality entertainment and two of our digital services, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, were started without enough money to commission truly original and inspiring programmes, programming of the quality people expect from the BBC. </p> <p> If we want to spend more money on our traditional services, and we do need to, there are certain consequences. Firstly we have to find the money and secondly we have to limit our plans for new services to what we can afford. </p> <p> This year's licence fee settlement, which gave us an increase of inflation plus 1.5% every year for seven years was a fair, even generous, award. By 2007 this will produce a real increase</p>",
  "Minor charges against five police officers who stood by while a black former paratrooper choked to death on his own blood are to be reviewed by the crown prosecution service after an inquest jury's unanimous verdict of unlawful killing. <p>Relatives of Christopher Alder, who was filmed by security cameras half-naked, handcuffed and dumped on a police station floor in Hull, cheered and jumped from their seats as the jury foreman described the death as happening \"while in a police van and being laid on the floor of the custody suite\". </p> <p>Calls for an independent body to examine all deaths in police custody, and particularly why so many involve members of ethnic minorities, were galvanised by the decision yesterday at Hull coroner's court. </p> <p>The jury of five men and three women - reduced by one after a member was discharged for allegedly making a racist remark - reached its decision after watching the graphic police video of the last 12 minutes of Alder's life. </p> <p>They also heard fresh medical evidence from the state pathologist of Northern Ireland, Prof Jack Crane, and a leading expert in deaths under restraint, Dr Nathaniel Cary, which will form part of the CPS review. Both experts concluded that Alder, who was accused by one officer on the videotape of faking and being \"as right as rain\", died because of blocked air passages that might have been cleared by emergency medical help. </p> <p>The four constables and a sergeant shown on the video as Alder lay dying on the floor of the custody suite at Queen's Gardens police station in Hull are currently suspended and face criminal charges of misconduct in public office amounting to wilful neglect. They declined to answer potentially incriminating questions at the inquest on more than 150 occasions. The inquest heard that Sgt John Dunne and PCs Nigel Dawson, Neil Blakey, Mark Ellerington and Matthew Barr all thought that Alder was play-acting or asleep until Barr suddenly noticed he had stopped breathing and a vain life-saving attempt was organised. </p> <p>Alder's sister Janet said: \"Justice has been done at last, but it has taken 28 months to get to the only true verdict which could have been given. I want to thank the jury and send them my compliments, and let's hope now we get a proper prosecution.\" </p> <p>Ms Alder's solicitor, Ruth Bundy, said the CPS should be looking at the possibility of gross negligence or manslaughter charges against the Humberside officers, after the evidence that emerged during the six-week hearing. She also criticised the Hull coroner, Geoffrey Saul, for concluding his instructions to the jury with a statement that the inquest - the longest to be held into a death in police custody - had seen no evidence that \"what happened that night had anything to do with the colour of Christopher's skin\". </p> <p>Ms Bundy, whose case was one of the first to be funded under new legislation extending legal aid to inquests of particular public interest, said: \"When is racism ever overt in these cases? The MacPherson report has taught us all about institutional racism, and that terrible image on the film of a black man left like a sack of potatoes to die on the floor speaks volumes about skin colour.\" </p> <p>The jury had been warned by Mr Saul not to allow the video to overshadow other evidence, including the fact that the police had been told by emergency staff at Hull royal infirmary that Alder was fit to go home. He was arrested after refusing to leave the hospital, where he was taken after a fight outside the Waterfront, a club in Hull city centre.</p>",
  "Jack Straw, the home secretary, is clearly feeling rather bruised by the recent criticisms made by the United Nations committee on elimination of race discrimination of the government's race strategy. After all, the UK's report to them was not only - as always - lengthy and on time, it was also probably the most open and progressive report it had submitted: recording some positive achievements and targets, stating its commitment to achieving race equality and admitting to the need for further work. <p>Had Straw been at the committee's meeting in Geneva, he might not have been so surprised. One of the issues on which the government came to grief, as many of its predecessors have, was over the race/immigration divide. </p> <p>The government stressed its toughness on institutional racism and racial attacks, its commitment to employment equality targets, and its strong support for the Lawrence family and inquiry. But this only served to highlight the failure to respond promptly and clearly to a vicious and racist anti-asylum-seeker press campaign, the exemptions for immigration law in the new Race Relations (Amendment) Act, and the social exclusion of asylum-seekers that is almost bound to result from the new support system of dispersal and vouchers. </p> <p>The UN committee were right to conclude as they did that racism is indivisible; there cannot be a trade-off between fair treatment of minority groups already here and those that newly arrive. Attacks on one group of strangers encourage hostility to all who are visibly different. As the committee pointed out, the dispersal system \"may hamper the adequate access of asylum-seekers to legal and other necessary services, eg health and education\". So, while one part of government has an action plan designed to deal with the consequences of decades of racial injustice, another is setting up a system that is likely to create disadvantage and exclusion for the present and future. </p> <p> O ne of the most important elements, for those of us from non-government groups who were present, and for the committee itself, was the presence of around a dozen black and Asian people from ethnic minority and community organisations. They had come to be witnesses, in both senses: listening to the hearings, and also providing vivid personal testimony to members of the committee on inadequate investigation of deaths in custody, school exclusions and racial harassment in schools, the degrading treatment of asylum-seekers and the marginalisation of community organisations. Those testimonies were a powerful reminder of the people who lie behind the statistics and who are supposed to underpin the policies in the UK's report. </p> <p>Though the government claimed that its report had been written after consultation with over 40 of the main race bodies, those who were present did not find that their views or their voices had been properly reflected. They were part of a larger group of human rights, asylum and community organisations which presented an alternative report on UK race policies, with some powerful criticisms. </p> <p>They are not the only group to feel consulted but not listened to: children's rights groups made the same comments about the UK's report on the rights of the child convention; many asylum groups regretted the time and energy spent in discussions that seemed to have little effect on the eventual content of the Immigration and Asylum Act. Homeless groups have spoken of \"access without influence\". Often, the government ap pears to signal that what it wants from the non-governmental community is gratitude, rather than engagement. </p> <p>The irony is that, in relation to this report, the key concerns of the committee and outside groups are also core parts of the government programme. Action on racist attacks and harassment school exclusions, equality of employment opportunities, dealing with institutional racism within the police and public authorities - even the successful integration of asylum-seekers - are all among the key government objectives presented to the UN committee. </p> <p>The committee is looking for outcomes, however, as well as policies: it wants a progress report and a comprehensive strategy. non-governmental organisations have unique experience that can assist in achieving those outcomes. That should be an opportunity, not a problem, for a government that opened its report to the committee by stressing its \"joined-up\" approach as well its appreciation of its \"critical friends\" outside government. </p> <p>\u0095 Anne Owers is director of the campaigning organisation Justice </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "It was supposed to be a stunning focal point for a \u00a397m millennium scheme to revamp a historic courtyard in the British Museum. Officials were confident that Sir Robert Smirke's 150-year-old Great Court would be beautifully set off by its new glass roof and a revamped south portico, splendidly restored with traditional Portland stone. <p>But heritage experts were aghast when the scaffolding around the portico was removed to expose a startling mismatch in colour between the new startlingly light-coloured stone and the much darker rest of the building. </p> <p>Yesterday the scheme, paid for with Lottery money, was embroiled in controversy as the museum's managing director claimed it had been deceived by a stonemason who used cheaper French stone for the portico. </p> <p>Despite the alleged deception being discovered more than a year ago, the museum decided to let the work carry on and is clinging to the hope that when the Queen opens the new courtyard in December, it will be considered a fine addition. However, it is possible that the local council, Camden, which is responsible for ensuring that the work has not harmed the Grade I listed building, could order that the French stone be removed. </p> <p>Privately, councillors are said to have been horrified by the hue of the stone. Brian Woodrow, chairman of the development control committee, said: \"Camden has not approved the use of French stone. We are seeking advice on how to proceed.\" </p> <p>English Heritage said its experts considered the work \"unfortunate, to say the least\". One classical architect described the effect as \"patched up\". </p> <p><b> Flamboyant</b><br> </p> <p> Lord Foster's firm, Foster and Partners, was chosen as architect for the prestigious project and in 1997 tenders were invited for the construction work. Five companies bid and Easton Masonry, run by a flamboyant Dorset stonemason, Geoff Smith, won with a tender of \u00a31.75m. The museum was confident he would do a good job as his company had been behind commendable work on the Guildhall in the City, and the Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery. </p> <p>The contract stipulated that the portico had to be built in \"an oolithic limestone - Portland stone ... or similar\". Under European law it is not legal to specify that Portland stone itself should be used. Oolithic simply means \"egg-shaped\" and describes many thousands of limestones. </p> <p>Museum officials, however, claim they were led to believe that Portland stone would be used. Suzanna Taverne, managing director of the museum, claimed that the contractor always referred to it as Portland, and in the drawings the stone was labelled \"Portland\". </p> <p>Manufacture began in March 1998 and 1,000 tonnes of stone were moved on site in March 1999. The museum says that just before the stone arrived the museum received an anonymous tip-off that French stone had been used instead. </p> <p>Ms Taverne insisted that rumours about the stone had not reached the Bloomsbury museum beforehand - even though the South Dorset MP, Ian Bruce, had been corresponding since the previous summer with both the culture department and Foster and Partners about the allegations regarding the stone. </p> <p>In August 1998, the minister for the arts, Alan Howarth, wrote to Mr Bruce insisting that the stone was definitely Portland. He wrote: \"The Heritage Lottery Fund's project monitors have confirmed that 'real' Portland stone is being used for the new portico.\" </p> <p>The same month, Giles Robinson, of Foster and Partners, wrote to a rival stone quarry which had been making its own inquiries, insisting that there was \"no confusion\" about the stone. In October, he wrote again, saying: \"I would like to reassure you that Portland stone is being used.\" </p> <p>Samples of the stone had been tested throughout - but passed as Portland by the British Museum. After the rumours reached the museum, further tests were carried out which established in June last year that the stone was not Portland. Finally, it was discovered that it was the French stone Anstrude Roche Claire, an excellent stone but one not considered as fine as Portland. </p> <p>By September 1999, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, was involved. He said the Heritage Lottery Fund was \"exploring further\" why Portland stone had not been used and English Heritage was being commissioned to investigate. Later that month his officials were investigating to establish \"whether there has been an attempt at fraud\". </p> <p>The museum is furious. Ms Taverne alleged yesterday: \"We were taken in.\" Asked if the museum had been naive, she said: \"With hindsight, you wonder if you should have been more vigilant.\" The stonemason, Mr Smith, was not available for comment yesterday. A receptionist at his company said neither he nor his secretary were in the office. </p> <p>Mr Bruce said that in conversations he had had with the stonemason, Mr Smith had insisted that he had done nothing wrong, claiming that it had been known what sort of stone he was using. Experts estimate that he could have saved around \u00a3100,000 by using the French stone. </p> <p>The museum could have ordered that the French stone be removed and the work begun again - at an estimated cost of \u00a33m - or persevere and hope the end result was satisfactory. It decided on the latter course, but does not intend to pay Easton Masonry its fee of \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Critics have said pressure to finish the millennium scheme this year might have had an undue influence on the decision. </p> <p>English Heritage inspected the work last October and decided that the stone was \"adequate\", but yesterday a spokesman admitted it had been \"surprised\" by the colour of the stone when the scaffolding was recently removed. It will not make its final judgment until the project is finished in December. </p> <p>Yesterday a meeting was taking place between Camden council, the museum and English Heritage. A spokeswoman said the options were being discussed and it was possible that the stone could be treated or coloured. </p> <p>Another project designed by Lord Foster - the wobbling pedestrian Millennium Bridge over the Thames - has already caused huge controversy. </p> <p><b>It's all in the ooliths</b></p> <p><b> Portland stone</b> </p> <p><b> Age</b> Dates from the Jurassic period 145m years ago </p> <p><b> Where it is found</b> Portland in Dorset </p> <p><b> How it is created</b> Dissolved carbon dioxide in shallow, tropical seas reacted with calcium and bicarbonate ions to create thick layers of lime. When the sea level dropped they were compressed under deposits from saline lagoons </p> <p><b> Cost</b> A 1,000 cubic metre block costs around \u00a30.5m </p> <p><b> Qualities</b> Considered a very 'fine' stone because it can be carved in a very straight line without the risk of crumbling. It is also very strong as the space between the grains, or ooliths, is very small. </p> <p><b> As seen at</b> St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, Buckingham Palace, much of Whitehall </p> <p><b> Anstrude Roche Claire</b> </p> <p><b> Age</b> From the Jurassic age </p> <p><b> Where it is found</b> An area north-west of Dijon in France </p> <p><b> How it is created</b> Similar except for differences in colour and texture </p> <p><b> Cost</b> A little cheaper - around \u00a3400,000 for 1,000 cubic metres </p> <p><b> Qualities</b> Slightly less good for detailed carving work and not as strong </p> <p><b> As seen at</b> The Banque de France and the Casino d'Enghien in Paris</p>",
  "Liberia today released four journalists working for Channel 4 after an international outcry following their arrest on espionage charges a week ago. <p>The Foreign Office confirmed that the Liberian president, Charles Taylor, had announced that he was freeing the men.</p> <p>Last Friday's arrest of the television crew - two Britons, a Sierra Leonean and a South African - sparked outrage around the world.

Channel 4 said that the men had suffered \"mental abuse\". </p> <p>The arrests had angered international leaders and press freedom groups.

  "In late spring, as magnolias shed their last petals and bluebells began to carpet the woods, a remarkable transformation occurred. William Hague, the much mocked and maligned leader of the Conservative party, seized on the case of the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin and began to make a fiercely populist case for a far tougher line on law 'n' order than any thing so far proposed even by tough old Jack Straw. Tabloid newspapers which had looked on him until then with no great approval started to change their tune: though in truth they could scarcely have done otherwise, since what he was saying came straight from their own leader columns. <p>Mr Hague, it was said, had at last struck a chord which chimed with the nation. His dire poll ratings and those of his party began to edge shyly upwards. By May, he was telling his shadow cabinet colleagues that his tough talk had closed the gap between Labour and the Conservatives and a general election victory was now in the party's grasp. A columnist in the Spectator, congratulating himself on having said all along that Hague was going to make it, challenged other Conservative columnists to show they had said the same. In this sudden cold climate, Labour grew apprehensive, and a series of leaks began to ooze out, all damaging to the party. Ken Follett claimed Tony Blair and his court were losing their touch. And although the Labour machine vilified him for saying it, what they said themselves in memos from Philip Gould to Tony Blair and back again was not so vastly different from his indictment. The Tories and William Hague, much of the world began to agree, were at last on their way. </p> <p>Four months and 14 pints (or 32 rum and cokes, according to subsequent versions) later, the great Hague recovery seems to be melting away like summer snow in Hull. The latest Mori poll for the Times confirms what was predicted here a fortnight ago. With its public spending review in mid-July and the NHS plan that followed, Labour has recaptured control of the political agenda and is back above 50% support for the first time since April. The Conservatives meanwhile have fallen four points in a month and are back below 30%. As for soaraway Hague, he is once again sinking fast: the proportion of voters unhappy with him exceeds the proportion that is happy by 25 percentage points. </p> <p>There are various lessons here, for the parties and for the rest of us. Perhaps the most potent is this: they, and we, must learn to disentangle the ephemeral and peripheral from what moves at the heart of politics. What excitement there was when Ken Follett spoke out! And what remains of it now? Just as William Hague and his fan club gloated too early, so Labour ought not to assume that the latest poll evidence has wiped him off the map. There are other factors which might partly account for this dip. With parliament on holiday and most of its biggest hitters away, there is always some tendency for the government side to go up in the polls in high summer while the opposition goes down. Even so, the Tory euphoria of a few weeks ago looks even more vacuous now than it did then. It was notable even then that a newspaper like the Sun, whose words Mr Hague was echoing, never, even in lauding his statemanlike ways, came anywhere near endorsing him for May 2001. So long as Labour keeps to a steady course, does not duck adversity and declines to be panicked by focus group views which themselves are often ephemeral, Mr Hague looks set for a long term in opposition. Or a shorter one if they dump him.</p>",
  "<p>The government has dropped its attempt to rush through email snooping laws ahead of the European court's introduction of the Human Rights Act, amid strong industry criticism.</p> <p>The Home Office had wanted the rules affecting email and phone surveillance by employers, under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, to come into force before October 2, when the European court's law comes into effect. </p> <p>The existing surveillance regime has already been successfully challenged in the European court of human rights and Jack Straw, the home secretary, is keen to avoid similar embarrassments under the court's landmark new rights act.</p> <p>But industry has strongly criticised the proposed rules on business monitoring of emails. The Alliance for Electronic Business, which includes the Confederation of British Industry has condemned the government's approach as \"totally impractical and indeed impossible\" to comply with. The alliance said the rules would \"deny businessmen day-to-day access to their own correspondence when conducted electronically by means of email or voice mail\".</p> <p>Under pressure from industry, the government has agreed to a three-week extension to the consultation period on the proposed rules, due to end today. \"Industry asked for more time to consult and we have been at pains to involve industry in the process,\" a Home Office official said.</p> <p>The proposed rules require companies to obtain the consent of both the sender and receiver of emails, voice mails and other messages for any monitoring. Industry wants the government to reverse the whole thrust of the proposals to allow the blanket monitoring of employees without consent. Civil liberty campaigners and unions consider that approach to be unacceptable.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\" http://www.fei.org.uk/fei/public/position/aeb.htm \">The alliance for electronic business</a></p>",

  "<p>It's a joyrider. Must be. Outside the canteen of a Copenhagen film company, there's a screech of tyres and a blur of scarlet as a freshly waxed Alfa Romeo careers past the window, shuddering to a halt 50 yards from where it started. It's the kind of car teenage boys dream about, open-top, brilliant red, more-than-faintly phallic: a car for men with a sense of flash. Or joyriders. </p> <p>And out steps Lars von Trier, the 44-year-old enfant terrible of European cinema, director of such contentious landmarks as Breaking The Waves and The Idiots, \"chief rabbi\" of Dogme 5. Here he comes, with his DIY haircut and his shapeless T-shirt, scratching his stubble, beaming excitably.</p> <p>The car's new, says his vaguely weary assistant, a gift from a dealership in exchange for some publicity shots. So now Lars von Trier drives a bright red, brazenly penile Alfa Romeo convertible. The word, you feel, is incongruous. Which is also the word for his latest feature, Dancer In The Dark. Because Dancer In The Dark is hardly your average movie: in fact, it isn't even your average Lars von Trier movie. </p> <p>The story of Selma, a Czech immigrant factory worker in the midwest who escapes her epic suffering though a passion for show tunes, it's a classic melodrama - an act of God here, an abject betrayal there - allied to an innovative musical, all filtered through its director's handheld video camera.</p> <p>A harrowing masterpiece with choreography by Madonna's hoofing coach, it made me - for all the best reasons - cry. It might make you cry too. Then again, it could make you sick. You may find Bj\u00f6rk's central performance heartbreaking; you may feel swindled and violated. It's possible you'll fall in love with it. There's every chance you'll really, truly hate it. </p> <p>Von Trier didn't have the Alfa Romeo when he was making it: instead, he shuttled comically around the set in his army buggy. When the time came for this year's Cannes film festival, however, he opted for civilian transport, arriving on the Riveira in his ageing camper van.</p> <p>Maybe you heard about Cannes. Maybe you heard about von Trier winning the Palme d'Or, and the movie's gala screening. Barely had the closing credits begun before the place erupted in ecstatic applause. Then it erupted in violent jeers. Then they just erupted together, a standing ovation with a side order of outrage. It's that kind of film. </p> <p>In his office, the Palme d'Or propped up against a sofa, we smalltalk before I tell him veteran critics who were there say they've never seen anything like it. His eyes light up; if anyone could ever be said to twinkle mischievously, it's Lars von Trier. \"Oh, but that is fine. I think that if people react at all, then\" - he breaks out in a smirk - \"you've reached the parts that Heineken cannot get to.\"</p> <p>So he wouldn't have preferred the applause without the catcalls? \"No, if it was only applause I would feel even more at the end of my career than I do already. Because the more everybody likes what you do, the less reason there is to do it. No, booing is fine. I'm quite happy with booing.\" </p> <p>About now you remember you're talking to someone who once suggested a film should be \"like a rock in the shoe\". \"Oh yes, I stand by that,\" he says. \"Except now it's a Prozac in the shoe.\" </p> <p>This may ring a bell. The last time this newspaper spoke to von Trier, he was raving over the wonder pill for alleviating his legion phobias. Two years on, he's still smitten. \"Ah, Prozac... when you break the capsule and you have the sweet powder, aaaah. Yes, I love to have some in my pocket, and pull my hand out and there's that sweet smell.\"</p> <p>He stares at me, suddenly weirdly earnest. \"You don't use Prozac?\" No, I don't. He gives me the look of a man who believes it's entirely my loss. \"Well, I've been taking it for several years now, and I still think it's a good drug. I mean, before I had such anxiety that I couldn't leave my room, and now I can even go to Cannes...\" The smirk returns. \"And get booed.\" </p> <p>It's true: the von Trier of old could never have handled the furore so calmly. This time he had a different obstacle: Bj\u00f6rk, who tried to have the screening cancelled over \"musical differences\" (she later won the award for best actress). In response, he called her a madwoman, a remark not untypical of their relationship. On set, so the story goes, he would cajole, she - without prior acting experience - break down; he would push, she call the lawyers. So, Lars, let's talk about Bj\u00f6rk. </p> <p>\"Bj\u00f6rk?\" he deadpans. \"Bj\u00f6rk? I know many Bj\u00f6rks. Do you have a specific one in mind?\" Yup: the singing one. The star of your film. Bj\u00f6rk Gudmundsdottir. \"Ah, good old Gudmundsdottir! Yes, I remember.\" He rubs his belly reflectively. \"You know, when we were filming, it was actually quite good. As people on our way to work and from work, we had a bad time, but with the camera running, it was the closest I have been to an actor...\" There's something else; he's trying not to laugh. \"When we were filming, I was inside her. Will you make sure to write that? I was inside her.\" </p> <p>Meet a man who knows journalists. But if they had such an affinity, why the arguments and tantrums? Arguments and tantrums, it should be noted, of reputedly biblical proportions. \"Well, it wasn't so much arguments, it was more that she felt the pain of the story very personally. It was like having some poor animal in a film that felt tortured just being there. And that was unpleasant, yes. The thing was, I could have taken her where she needed to go, and helped her get back, but... that never happened.\" </p> <p>Among the various yarns, one stands out. His eyes widen disingenuously. The costume eating? \"Ah, I wasn't there. But I understand she did harm to her costume, yes.\" With her teeth? \"I was not there. But I understand there was a problem with finding bits of a costume that Bj\u00f6rk had done harm to. Off-screen.\" By now, he's almost convulsing with the effort of keeping a straight face, the need for diplomacy. \"Well, there's no reason not to be diplomatic. I understand her pain. But I must say, if it had been me that ate a blouse, I would be quite proud. And I'm not saying that she ate a blouse...\" </p> <p>He gives in, laughing hard. \"But if she ate a blouse, I don't think she would be proud. Me, if something drove me to eat a blouse, I would tell the world.\" The mood only changes when I ask what he's learned from it all. His gaze settles on the corner of the room. \"Nothing.\" He frowns inquisitively. \"No, I think, unfortunately, both of us have walked away from this as not better human beings. I think that's what happens. You don't get better. On the other hand, I'm quite content with the results, so...\" He trails off. \"But I'm sorry if Bj\u00f6rk has scars. I have scars too.\" </p> <p>His phone rings. He takes the call, talks for less than a minute, then returns to the couch. It was his wife, asking if he wants an ISDN line \"so I can dowload filth faster\". A conversation about internet porn ensues, none of which is strictly relevant save him feigning shock at my prudery: \"Come on! You should love the internet! The English are the filthiest people in the world.\" I try to get him back on to the film. </p> <p>\"So yes, Bj\u00f6rk said I was a sadistic arsehole...\" Actually, I wanted to talk about its status as the most high-profile musical in decades, laden as it is with Selma's all-singing, all-dancing reveries. Although it works because it's played so straight, he must have seen the danger of seeming arch.</p> <p>\"Yes, yes, yes,\" he nods. \"But the genre can be so strong that you don't need to parody it. These were films I loved as a child, but that doesn't mean I have to distance myself from them...\" The phone rings again. Flapping slightly, he curses - I think - in Danish. \"So it was very important to make Selma a character people could care about,\" he gabbles, lifting the receiver, \"and where it was clear music was so important to her that it wouldn't seem artificial... Hello?\" </p> <p>There's another hiatus. Afterwards, he unplugs the phone. \"Something about the kids. As someone with four, I must tell you that if you have them one by one, it's very nice. Otherwise, you must be the policeman, which is not particularly interesting or we would have been policemen, wouldn't we?\" </p> <p>Childhood and parenting: familiar ground for von Trier. Anyone sceptical of Dancer In The Dark's ripened melodrama would surely blanch at its director's biography. First came the upbringing by stalwart communists, left wholly free of adult interference (the inspiration, he says, for most of his phobias).</p> <p>Then the clincher: his mother's deathbed confession in 1995 that her late husband was not his biological father. He met the real thing four times before the old man cut off contact. Within a year, von Trier left his first wife, converted to Catholicism (hitherto believing he was Jewish), and made Breaking The Waves, the film which began his departure from the polite sensibilities of his early career (dazzlingly unhinged hospital soap The Kingdom notwithstanding). </p> <p>Now he lives in the suburbs with his second wife and is, by all accounts - except perhaps Bj\u00f6rk's - a model of adjustment. He peers at his feet. \"You know, it's an interesting power, your upbringing. Of course, family is important, but we should also remember it is the root of conflict. We have this craving for a home, this animal urge you can't control in an intellectual way, and while you can be logical and...\" He looks up, genuinely puzzled. \"Why am I trying to be clever about this? Ask me about the film.\" </p> <p>So I do: specifically, I ask about the controversy which follows his career like a lost dog. For every viewer who found the sexual extremities of Breaking the Waves redemptive, someone else was walking out in dumbstruck horror; The Idiots, meanwhile, dealt with physical handicap and erections: enough said. And now there's Dancer In The Dark, already condemned as emotional pornography (actually, that was one of Bj\u00f6rk's). For the only time while I'm with him, he seems indifferent. \"Yeah. OK. People can say that. Of course, in truth, I'm a poor softie...\" </p> <p>Only he's not a softie to those vexed by what they see as the hallmark of his last three films: sacrificial women. His expression hovers somewhere indefinite. \"Ah, I never knew the word.\" Misogyny? \"Right. And precisely it means...?\" Hating women. \"Uh-huh. OK.\" He gives the matter what looks like serious thought. \"No, I don't think there's hatred.\" Now there's a glint in his eye. \"I mean, firstly my mother was a woman...\" And did you like your mother, Lars? I'm expecting a punchline. Instead, his brow furrows. </p> <p>\"I don't know if... I respected her very much. Liked her, yeah, I suppose. I mean, it wasn't an uncomplicated relationship. But I don't think these are representatives of real women. They're characters from my own female side. And hating or belittling women, that's not my intention. I see them as the stronger sex, because they're unpredictable.\"</p> <p>Panic spreads across his face. \"That does sound belittling.\" He holds his head in his hands. \"I'm sorry... oh, wouldn't life be better if it was just men and the internet?\" And then he smiles and says \"I think she won.\" Who? Bj\u00f6rk? \"Yes. I think she won. I remember telling someone in my family about her, and they were saying 'Oh Lars, how terrible', and then they saw the film and said 'Shame on you!' And I said what? And they said 'Shame on you! This woman is a saint. A saint!' \" </p> <p>Speaking of which, how's the Catholicism working out? He screws up his nose. \"Oh, it's not. I don't know, it seems like this God wants us to kneel. Which I don't find logical. I mean, if his creation is so great, why does he want us on our knees? I'm sure I'll be punished in the afterlife for saying that. Or no,\" - there's some hardcore twinkling going on - \"And shame on you! Of course, Bj\u00f6rk will have some studio there, with her rappers running around. And I'll say, OK, I'll take hell instead.\" </p> <p>Grinning the same artless grin he wore when he first walked in, Lars von Trier gestures through his office window, on into the outside world. \"And in the meantime, I have this fantastic car. What more could I want?\"</p> <p>\u0095 Dancer in the Dark is released on September 15.</p>",
  "<p>Meet Mark and Michael. Mark is the one on the left in black with the ghostly face and shorter hair. Michael is the other one. I think. Michael and Mark Polish, as in the country. The Polish twins star in and have written and directed their first film, Twin Falls Idaho. Well, actually Michael did the directing, while Mark did the writing.</p> <p>The film is about a pair of twins who are inseparable, in every sense. They think alike, talk alike, share the same interests, the same body. The Siamese twins hold on tight to each other to protect themselves against a prying, cruel world. They seek refuge in a surreal hotel with twisted staircases, dropping ceilings and invisible doors. Twin Falls Idaho is a gentle and creepy love story that wouldn't look out of place in David Lynch's portfolio. </p> <p>We meet in a club that could have been modelled on the hotel. I bend my back up the stairs, am led through an invisible door and find the twins waiting for me by a warm fire. They dress almost identically. I feel as if I'm trapped in a spot-the-difference competition (Aha! Michael is wearing snazzy trainers, Mark's in black shoes.) </p> <p>Michael plays the weaker character, Francis. Funny, says Michael, in real life Mark is the weaker one. As a child, his appendix exploded, and as a young man he had a motorbike accident that left him with broken femur, tibia, fibia, wrists, ribs. Unfortunately, Michael explains, Mark was too weak to play Francis (his legs weren't up to it) so he had to play Blake, the stronger character. </p> <p>The twins, 28, start gabbling to each other, quietly and affectionately. I feel like a gooseberry. They talk about the hit-and-run accident that left Mark out of action for 18 months. \"I can't remember if I heard and I started limping or if I was limping before I heard about it,\" says Michael.</p> <p>\"But I remember seeing him in the hospital, I actually beat the ambulance to the hospital. He was coming in and I saw his leg and it was that big, like elephantiasis or something. I thought this is sick, this is bad. He couldn't see his own leg, and then my leg started going numb, and I remember thinking, 'Boy this is sick.' I can't tell you if this was being a twin or just being empathetic.\" </p> <p>The twins say that was unusual, they don't normally feel every twinge and prick the other experiences. They feel perfectly confident in their own identities and abilities. Michael is the visual artist, Mark the writer. </p> <p>\"We have different chins, and different hair, and different noses, and our eyes are different. Physically,\" says Mark. </p> <p>\"Yeah, physically,\" says Mark. </p> <p>\"Yeah, physically, we're different,\" says Michael. </p> <p>The twins have a slightly dysfunctional bent, an anorak quality common to many film-makers. Perhaps it comes from too much life experienced secondhand in the dark. \"I'm shyer,\" says Michael. \"I'll definitely avoid the public more. He won't seek it out, but he's more comfortable in it.\" </p> <p>As children, they would skip schools, hop on their bikes and go to the movies. They talk about great films they've seen - all sorts from Mad Max and Dr Zhivago, to Saturday Night Fever. None of them remotely like the film they've made. </p> <p>Polish by name, American by nationality, with Mexican and Austrian blood running deep in their veins, they were raised in California. After school, Michael went to LA to study art, Mark followed a year or so later to audition for acting parts he never got. What drew them to the arts? They answer in unison. </p> <p>\"Shit!\" </p> <p>\"Fuck!!\" </p> <p> \"GOD!!!\" </p> <p>\"We were bored, just retarded.\" </p> <p>\"Bored! We lived in a very small community.\" Mark says at school only one out of eight hours a day was dedicated to art, and it frustrated them. </p> <p>Michael says Twin Falls Idaho is influenced by paintings rather than film. Perhaps if Rembrandt and Max Ernst had collaborated on a movie they might have come up with something like this. The film's painterly look defies its $500,000 budget. Yes, says, Michael painterly is the word. \"Paint is an ally. It changes the mood immediately. A lot of independent films don't take the sets into consideration. I mean you paint the walls rather than keep them white. You do set decoration.\" </p> <p>\"A gallon of paint only costs $24,\" says Mark. </p> <p>Twin Falls Idaho is a complicated love story. The couple turn into a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois when the stronger brother, Blake, falls in love with a woman. The relationship is handled with great delicacy - they only kiss when Francis is asleep. Mark says in the end the overwheming love is between the brothers, both of whom will sacrifice everything for the other. </p> <p>The film is largely about the brothers looking out on the world, and witnessing a freak show rather than the other way round. Initially, says Michael, they weren't interested in how the world saw them. But gradually, as they were shooting the film, they realised it would fail to reflect reality if they didn't occasionally show the world staring them in the faces.</p> <p>\"We thought people were past that kind of stuff, but when we were doing a photo shoot there were a couple of dozen people just staring at us.\" When it came to the more tricky Siamese scenes - playing the guitar together, fighting, having an affair - no one involved on the set could stay away. The brothers may not have wanted to make a film about voyeurism, but in the end they realised that had to be part of the story. </p> <p>Did they feel like freaks? </p> <p>\"No,\" says Michael. </p> <p>\"No,\" says Mark. </p> <p>\"But I did think shit, this is the daily thing they go through...\" </p> <p>\"And I think Francis's character started to evolve into someone who always turned from the people staring at him.\" </p> <p>They both talk about the way strangers feel they have a claim on twins; the right to know; how they ask questions they would never presume to ask of other people - how were you born, who's older, do you feel strange when you're apart? </p> <p>It can be funny, they say when people realise they are intruding but can't help themselves anyway. \"Sometimes they're nervous and they're juddering, and they start talking about their cousins or uncles who are twins and you find out they're revealing much more about themselves than they'll ever get from you.\" </p> <p>I realise I am staring at them in exactly the same way. God knows which one is speaking. </p> <p>\"Mark's chin is a little thinner,\" says Michael by way of a reminder. </p> <p>\"Yes, thinner,\" says Mark. </p> <p>They tell me about their separate lives. Both boys have long-term partners. Mark has a little girl called Jasper, Michael has a boxer called Dulcey. </p> <p>Despite their geeky diffidence, the twins know exactly what they want out of life. \"We are very passionate about making a great film,\" says Michael. Is Twin Falls Idaho the great film they are talking about? </p> <p>\"Oh no!\" exclaims an appalled Michael. </p> <p>\"Oh no!\" echoes his brother with an extra notch of anguish. \"This is a serious 12-step programme. We've got so far to go. I just see it now as flawed as hell.\" They say they don't want to tell me why they're disappointed with this fine film, but they can't resist. </p> <p>\"I think the pacing is a little slow,\" says Michael. </p> <p>\"To me why it is so flawed...\" Mark takes a deep breath and says how originally when it was first written the movie was going to have an epic sweep like Once Upon a Time in America. Not surprisingly, they didn't have the cash to make that film. </p> <p>\"In the next film, you'll see the real talent,\" says Mark. \"Michael will be behind the camera, conceiving.\" The next film is about a concrete dam that floods a town. Mark says Warner Brothers loved it, wanted to make it, but realised it didn't make financial sense - the brothers wanted to spend a maximum $3m making the movie, while Warners would spend a minimum $15m marketing it. They took the script to other studios who told them it was a bit different, a bit too different. When Mark was told there's nothing quite like that out there, he initially thought it was meant as a compliment. He pauses, baffled by Hollywood logic. \"...But then that's what they said about Twin Falls Idaho.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Twin Falls Idaho is released next Friday.</p>",
  "Clive Hollick, the Blairite media mogul, will be named next month as one of the most generous supporters of the cross-party Britain in Europe pressure group, which is campaigning to take Britain into the single currency. <p>In an attempt to counter claims that big businesses are shunning its campaign, Britain in Europe (BiE) is to publish a list of blue chip companies that have donated more than \u00a35,000 to the group, launched last year by Tony Blair. </p> <p>Lord Hollick, the chairman of United News and Media, which owns the pro-Blair Express group of newspapers, will be one of the most prominent names on the list, which also includes the former CBI chairman, Sir Brian Nicholson, whose Cookson engineering is supporting the cam paign, British American Tobacco, Unilever, Philips, BAE Systems, BP, ICL and KPMG. </p> <p>Unilever and BAE are each understood to have donated \u00a3100,000. BAT gave \u00a350,000, and the science minister, Lord Sainsbury, gave \u00a3400,000. </p> <p>The disclosure of Lord Hollick's support came as BiE inflamed the euro debate by naming a wide range of companies already using or planning to use the single currency. The decision of household names, such as Orange and Gillette, to adopt the euro suggests Britain will not be able to resist \"euro creep\" - the use of the euro as a parallel currency to the pound - even if its opts to stay out of the eurozone. </p> <p>The move follows the revelation this month that Toyota, the Japanese motor giant, has asked its suppliers to invoice the company in euros to protect itself against fluctuations in the value of the pound and that Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and household goods group, is \"encouraging\" its contractors to do the same. </p> <p>Gillette, the shaving product manufacturer, says it is already able to make and receive payments in euros and Orange, the mobile phone company, is planning to offer corporate and business customers a euro billing service. </p> <p>Nick Herbert, chief executive of Business for Sterling, the anti-single currency lobby group, dismissed the \"euro creep\" story as a red herring. </p> <p>\"British businesses use all sorts of currencies, including the dollar. It does not affect the argument about whether we should join economic and monetary union,\" he said. \"Indeed, you could say if British businesses are using the euro successfully, there's no need to join and lose control of our economy. The euro creep argument cuts both ways.\"</p>",
  "The distraught mother of a dead Russian sailor moved centre stage in the Kursk submarine drama yesterday as the symbol of national grief at the loss of 118 seamen and the Russian authorities' response. <p>Local television showed the woman being involuntarily sedated by injection as she abused a deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, who heads the inquiry into the disaster. She blamed navy chiefs and the government for her son's death. </p> <p>Examination of the footage, said to be filmed by local television in the northern port of Murmansk, revealed that the screaming woman collapsed after a medic apparently administered a sedative. </p> <p>The scene increased the criticism of the handling of the tragedy as inept. Captain Vladimir Navrotsky, spokesman for the northern fleet, last night dismissed suggestions that the woman had been silenced for political reasons. </p> <p>\"I'd be surprised if there had been an injection purely to keep her from talking. Probably the woman was worked up because of the conditions in the crowded hall,\" he said. </p> <p>The incident occurred last Friday in the Kursk's home port, Vidyayevo, north of Murmansk, as Mr Klebanov was confronted by furious relatives voicing their anger at the loss of their loved-ones. </p> <p>Although the Kremlin has imposed an almost total media blackout, a cameraman filmed the woman telling navy officers to tear off their epaulettes. </p> <p>The footage appeared to expose a chilling act of arbitrary crowd control in the traditions of Soviet-era medical abuse. </p> <p>But while the film confirmed the views of those who see the Russian military authorities as carrying on many of the practices of the repressive Soviet authorities, others saw the furore as a yardstick of how far Russia has travelled beyond the habits of the Soviet era. </p> <p>Dozens of the relatives of the Kursk seamen have been on tranquillisers since the tragedy. </p> <p>That the film was shot at all and then shown extensively, illustrated how far Russia has advanced. </p> <p>If the incident reflected badly on Mr Klebanov, he endured worse on Tuesday when he was attacked by the wife of one of the dead, according to a Moscow journalist who clandestinely recorded the scene. </p> <p>Relatives asked Mr Klebanov when the bodies would be recovered. \"In a few months - maybe. a year. I don't know exactly,\" he replied. </p> <p>\"'The room erupted,\" reported Andrei Kolesnikov of the Kommersant newspaper. \"A woman shook him. 'You swine, get out there and save them.' Officers rushed to drag her away. It wasn't easy. She clung to Klebanov and shouted, 'You're nothing but scum'.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Au Revoir Les Enfants</strong> <br>(Louis Malle, 1987) <br>8pm, FilmFour </p> <p>Malle's restrained and deeply moving autobiographical tale is set in a Roman Catholic school in occupied France.

After a halting start, a close friendship develops, and Jean's secret is revealed: he's Jewish, and is being hidden from the Germans by the head (Philippe Morier-Genoud).

Liam Neeson plays a private eye specialising in divorce (errant hubbies in flagrante and so forth), but the murder of his wife and the appearance of dangerous-to-know Laura San Giacomo raise the stakes. There's a breathless, old-fashioned race against time to save Neeson from the noose, and that's not the final twist. </p> <p><strong> Eyes Without A Face</strong><br>(Georges Franju, 1959)<br>12midnight, FilmFour </p> <p>Franju's horror classic must rank as the goriest film of its time - not counting his earlier abattoir documentary. Written by the Vertigo authors, there are similar obsessive overtones in Pierre Brasseur's deranged skin surgeon, determined to restore his daughter's missing face at any cost - including murdering young women and stealing theirs. Surgical details aside, the funereal atmosphere is unnervingly effective. </p> <p><strong> Blow-Up</strong><br>(Michelangelo Antonioni, 1966) <br>1am, TCM </p> <p>During a fashion shoot in a London park, ultra-hip 60s snapper David Hemmings inadvertently captures what he suspects to be a murder on film. Is Vanessa Redgrave (pictured) kissing or killing her victim in the shot's blurry background? At any rate, she sleeps with him in a failed attempt to recover the \"evidence\". So far, so Hitchcockian, but the mystery fades into the psychedelic background of swinging London, and an extravagantly visual exploration of truth and subjectivity.</p>",
  "It was a juicy exclusive. Under the headline \"Exclusive: William, king of the jungle\", the front page of yesterday's Daily Mail carried a picture of the young prince clutching a rifle, his face smeared with camouflage paint, apparently on manoeuvres in the wilds of Belize. <p>On page three, under a fuller version of the picture showing the prince standing with six Welsh Guards, the paper's royal correspondent wrote: \"Deep in the Central American jungle and surrounded by the fighting men of the Welsh Guards the 18-year old was clearly enjoying himself in this remarkable photograph taken during a training exercise in Belize.\" </p> <p>There was just one problem; far from being taken last week in central America the picture was actually taken over a year ago on Salisbury Plain while the prince was at Eton. </p> <p>Last night, as the embarrassed newspaper launched a damage limitation exercise, St James's Palace expressed its \"disappointment\" and privately indicated that an official complaint against the newspaper to the press complaints commission was possible. As the prince was under 18 and still at school at the time the photograph was taken publication potentially breaches the PCC code. </p> <p>The error came about despite liaison between the palace and the Daily Mail late on Wednesday. Prince William returned from the central American state on Tuesday following a four-day survival course, and executives at the newspaper mistakenly believed the photograph, which includes a stand of silver birch trees in the background, depicted the prince in a tropical rainforest. </p> <p>The army also pointed out that the prince was not wearing tropical uniform, had a rifle that would not have been used in jungle warfare and looked a lot younger than he appears today </p> <p>Lawrence Sear, the Mail's managing editor, last night said: \"The picture of Prince William was obtained from a reputable news agency. It was published in good faith.as having been taken in Belize. The Mail sought approval from St James's Palace to publish the picture.\" </p> <p>St James's Palace said: \"We did not see the photograph but it is easy to see how confusion could have arisen... we did not consider that we could object to its publication under the terms of the PCC's code of practice.\" </p> <p>Last night it emerged that a news agency, South West News Service, offered the Daily Mail the picture after being approached by a source who claimed to have taken it in Belize. \"We deeply regret any offence,\" said a spokesman.</p>",
  "The former MI5 officer David Shayler appeared in court for the first time yesterday, three years to the day after making the disclosures which are the subject of the charges against him. <p>Carmen Dowd, for the crown prosecution service, said Mr Shayler was charged under the Official Secrets Act with disclosing information in the Mail on Sunday on August 24, 1997, which was damaging to national security and to MI5's capability to carry out its work. </p> <p>She also said Mr Shayler had passed 62 \"sensitive\" documents to the newspaper relating to the activities of the security services. </p> <p>The subjects of the disclosures in the newspaper ranged from MI5's practice of keeping files on prominent Labour politicians, including Peter Mandelson and Jack Straw, as well as pop musicians - including John Lennon - to MI5's alleged incompetence in tracking Khalifa Ahmed Bazelya, a suspected Libyan intelligence officer then based in London. </p> <p>It is understood that as recently as last month, the prosecution was actively considering further charges including Mr Shayler's more serious and embarrassing allegations, namely MI6 involvement in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy. </p> <p>It is not known whether these charges were abandoned after the intervention of Lord Williams, the attorney general. Charges under the Official Se crets Act require the attorney's consent. </p> <p>The two offences with which Mr Shayler is charged were agreed by John Morris, Lord Williams's predecessor, at the time of the failed attempt to extradite the renegade MI5 officer from Paris in August 1998. </p> <p>A CPS spokeswoman said yesterday that the case papers had been reviewed and it was decided to choose two charges on the basis of the evidence. </p> <p>It is clear, however, that MI5 and MI6 would not welcome argument about the Gadafy plot and other sensitive allegations in open court. </p> <p>Much of the brief hearing at Bow Street magistrates' court in central London yesterday was taken up with discussion about Mr Shayler's bail conditions, notably whether he must stay with his brother in south London. </p> <p>\"He is a supporter of Middlesbrough football team, and the season has started, and he wishes to go to see Middlesbrough play this Saturday,\" said John Wadham, his lawyer, who is the director of Liberty, the civil rights group. </p> <p>\"Just imagine the publicity if the chief magistrate stopped him,\" replied London's chief stipendiary magistrate, Graham Parkinson. </p> <p>Mr Parkinson agreed to lifting of reporting restrictions. </p> <p>Mr Wadham told Mr Parkinson that Mr Shayler had returned voluntarily to Britain. </p> <p>Mr Shayler said after the hearing: \"I am glad the magistrate was sympathetic enough to let me go and see Middlesbrough play.\" </p> <p>He added: \"It is good to have the opportunity to appear in open court. I am glad that the legal process has begun. </p> <p>\"It gives us all the chance to examine the Official Secrets Act in the light of the human rights legislation.\" </p> <p><b>Useful Links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.mi5.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">MI5</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmbills/005/2000005.htm\" target=\"_new\">Freedom of information bill</a></p>",
  "<p>Martin Ballinger, the founder and managing director of Go-Ahead, yesterday rejected a hostile bid for his bus and rail company which would net him over \u00a323m. </p> <p>A French consortium has made a 650p a share offer valuing the company - which was at the centre of the Paddington rail disaster through its Thames Trains subsidiary - at \u00a3326m.</p> <p>Last year Mr Ballinger was paid a salary of \u00a3175,000, and he is on a two-year contract which would have to be bought out if the French succeed in their bid.</p> <p>Last night City analysts said an increased offer might be needed to win control of the company, which operates some London buses as well as rail services to the capital.</p> <p>Go-Ahead management said it was unanimous in rejecting the offer, which \"fails to recognise the strategic value of Go-Ahead, its performance to date and future prospects.\"</p> <p>The Newcastle-based company is chasing the South Central rail franchise as well as the two it controls through its holdings in the Thames Trains and Thameslink operations.</p> <p>Go-Ahead chairman Sir Frederick Holliday said the bid by Caisse des Depots-Developpement, or C3D, and Rhone Capital was purposely timed to precede the Strategic Rail Authority's decision on South Central.</p> <p>The French have turned aggressive after informal appoaches were made but rebuffed last month. C3D chairman Patrice Garnier accepted the bid was politically sensitive but said: \"We remain keen to reach agreement with the Go-Ahead board.\" The French company wants to combine Go-Ahead with its Transdev subsidiary and use it as a platform to expand in Europe.</p> <p>Shares in Go-Ahead soared 20% after the initial approach from C3D but yesterday they dropped a 1p at 675p. The 650p a share offer represents a 50p premium over its 433.5p price on July 6, when the predators first made their approach.</p> <p>Go-Ahead shares had reached 920p last year before they were hit by the negative publicity surrounding the crash of a Thames train near London's Paddington station.</p> <p>If Go-Ahead does fall it would give French companies a tighter grip on London transport because Connex holds the franchise for South Central and South Eastern trains.</p> <p>The French presence is not the only other controversial aspect of the deal.

  "<p>Jersey yesterday warned local banks to be wary of doing business with companies from the Cayman Islands and Malta because of concerns about money laundering. </p> <p>Underlining a determination to clean up its financial services industry, the Jersey financial services commission advised local firms that neither country's financial crime regulations were up to international standards and that they should check any business was legitimate before accepting it. </p> <p>Jersey has been under investigation by the financial action taskforce (FATF) combatting white-collar crime, but in June escaped being listed among countries not complying with international efforts to stamp out money laundering. </p> <p>This latest move marks an attempt to distance itself from countries still not cooperating with the FATF's work. </p> <p>\"Jersey is determined to pro tect itself from money laundering,\" said Richart Pratt, director general of the commission. \"This determination has kept us off the FAFT's non-cooperating jurisdiction list.\" </p> <p>The UK regulatory authorities already issue a similar warning to both countries. The Caymans were on the FATF's list of 15 countries not cooperating in the fight against money laundering, while Malta was one of the countries being investigated. </p> <p>\"The international regula tory and law enforcement agencies remain interested in what Jersey does,\" said Mr Pratt. \"To maintain our reputation and keep off the FATF's non-cooperative list, we must and will press on with our reform agenda.\" </p> <p>Jersey officials feared that inclusion on the list would have proved damaging the island's economy. </p> <p>Banks are increasingly wary about operating in jurisdictions which are thought to be soft on money laundering. The American authorities have warned their financial services industry to take care in their dealings with all the countries named by the FATF. </p> <p>But some of the countries included on the list complain that they were not properly consulted by the FATF ahead of publication. </p> <p>The Caymans and the Bahamas both expressed disappointment at still being \"named and shamed\" after their discussions with the financial action taskforce.</p>",
  "Away from the joyful chaos of Bilbao's annual street festival, opponents in Spain's terrorist agony are quietly deciding if the summer of blood will become a long war. <p>Four bomb blasts before dawn yesterday in the neighbouring towns of San Sebastian and Irun damaged shops, offices and trucks. It was further proof that the Basque separatist group Eta has found a rhythm which appears to be speeding up. </p> <p>Stalked by assassins, members of the government in Madrid want moderate Basque nationalists to stop talking to Eta and settle for a military solution. Negotiation is no longer an option, they says. </p> <p>Widely vilified for hesitating, the moderates are on the verge of abandoning Eta, and with it the likelihood of another ceasefire. </p> <p>The Basque region encompasses 100 miles of mountain scenery and industrial affluence between the Pyrenees and the northern coast of Spain. It has considerable autonomy from Madrid, more than any other region in Europe, but not enough for Eta, which has killed 11 people since ending its 14-month truce in December after stillborn peace talks. </p> <p>Optimists think a golden opportunity can be clawed back through all-party talks; others think this is the start of another 30 years of exploding cars and bullets. </p> <p>More than 800 people have already died. In silent vigils throughout the country, Spaniards have rallied to the government's vow to resist terrorist pressure. </p> <p>\"Not a centimetre,\"the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, said - meaning the political ground he is willing to cede to Eta for a lasting peace. </p> <p>In a Bilbao park two Eta men, Efren and Garikoitz, smiled and shook their heads. Speaking Basque through a translator, they said \"the organisation\" was waging a legitimate struggle for a homeland, called Euskadi, for a people with its own language, culture and history. Madrid was centralist and anti-democratic, they said. </p> <p>\"I don't feel Spanish at all. The only thing I am is Basque,\" Efren said. \"I don't have any quarrel with Spanish people, only the Spanish state.\" </p> <p>\"Madrid is not interested in peace. Its only objective is to keep control. Every time Aznar appears on TV talking about crushing us, he thinks that'll get him some votes.\" </p> <p>Efren's journalism degree course was interrupted by five years in prison for being a member of Eta, which stands for Euskadi and freedom. \"They tortured me - beatings, electrodes, a plastic bag over my head. Some friends got sick and died, no one helped them.\" </p> <p>Like many comrades, he was sent far away, to Seville to serve his sentence. \"It's unconstitutional, but they do it to punish the families,\" he said. </p> <p>Efren is a second-generation Basque from Portugalete, a town 10 miles outside Bilbao which attracts migrants from the rest of Spain. </p> <p>Garikoitz, 32, said the four Eta men who blew themselves up this month in Bilbao were freedom fighters. An architect's assistant, he said there was no shortage of recruits - a view confirmed by an interior ministry official. Garikoitz's sister is serving time in Paris for Eta membership. </p> <p>\"We do not feel free,\" he said. \"It's not just a state of mind, it's a reality.\" </p> <p>Security sources suggest that one reason the group ended the truce was to prevent a slide into political atrophy. Its motto is \"Actions unite, words divide.\" </p> <p>Another explanation is strategic. \"It may be that Eta is paving the way for a second truce in more advantageous conditions than the first,\" said Ramon Cotarelo, a political scientist. </p> <p>The police estimate that Eta's gunmen and bombers number less than 300,and that they rely on a network of passive and active support. In the region's last election, one in six voted for Eta's political wing, Euskal Herritarrok, formerly known as Herri Batasuna. </p> <p>Pedestrians in the prosperous Bilbao suburb of Getxo condemn the violence but blame Madrid for the ceasefire's collapse. </p> <p>The conflict was war, not a terror campaign, they said. </p> <p>\"Spanish people accuse us of not doing enough against Eta but Basques didn't start this. We shouldn't be policemen for the state,\" said a tattooed 22-year-old. \"I'm not going to vote against Euskal Herritarrok because I'm not going to vote at all.\" </p> <p>Eta banners flap freely on the main street in Balboa. Banks and mansions wear the scars of past firebombs, hurled to fulfil the group's anti-capitalist ideology. </p> <p>\"Kids here are well educated and well off but they join for emotional reasons, to be anti-establishment, to belong,\" said a pensioner, Juan Albeniz. </p> <p>While few in this region are willing to openly side with Madrid, Eta has its enemies. \"They are spoilt, murderous fascists,\" said Consuela Ordonez, 40, whose brother Gregorio, a councillor in San Sebastian, was shot dead. </p> <p>She said Madrid's refusal to negotiate had not sunk the ceasefire. \"The sole responsibility for the violence resuming is Eta's. They're a gang of fanatics. They hate society, they don't listen to people.\" </p> <p>Pessimistic about a resolution, she condemned the ambivalence of moderate Basque nationalists. \"Why don't they do more to stop the attacks? I don't understand.\" </p> <p>In addition to soldiers, police officers, businessmen and politicians, Eta's renewed campaign has been aimed at artists, intellectuals and journalists, including the columnist Jose Luis de la Calle, shot dead in May. </p> <p>Some writers may be intimidated into censoring their criticism, said Jose Manuel Alonso, a director of the newspaper El Mundo. Others may not. \"We don't want to be heroes, but we have a responsibility to do our jobs,\" he said. </p> <p>Eta called a ceasefire after the moderate Basque Nationalist party (PNV), which governs the region, moved closer to self-determination. The return to murder has strained that alliance, but Madrid wants it completely ruptured to isolate the militants. </p> <p>Critics accuse the mainstream media of slavishly backing Madrid's wishes, rather than encouraging the PNV to repair the alliance in the hope of wooing Eta back from the gun. </p> <p>\"This is a crucial phase. The PNV is coming under massive pressure to renounce the militants. If it does, it's a disaster, we're back to square one,\" said Gorka Espiau, of Elkarri, a non-partisan peace group. </p> <p>This morning, hundreds of youths in balaclavas will assemble at the town hall to cheer the raising of the Basque flag as part of the city's annual festival. </p> <p>When the Spanish flag is also raised stones and petrol bombs will fly through the air and a riot will ensue. While Efren and Garikoitz have outgrown such frivolity, they thought they might go along to watch their successors warming up.</p>",
  "<p>Business leaders yesterday cast doubt on the chancellor's ability to deliver the scale of public spending increases promised last month but suggested his failure to do so might be a blessing in disguise. </p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry said bureaucratic delays and a lack of spare capacity in the building industry could thwart Gordon Brown's efforts to inject an additional \u00a343bn into key services over the next three years. </p> <p>However, it said this would help to keep the lid on infla tion and rates at a time when there was still a danger of excess demand leading to overheating in the economy. </p> <p>Publishing its latest quarterly economic forecast, the CBI said its best guess was that inflation would be on target this year and next - despite growth being above the UK's historic trend. </p> <p>Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economics, said: \"Next year the main uncertainties for growth and inflation will be whether the chancellor's spending plans will be fully achieved, whether wages remain under control in a tight labour market and what happens to sterling. Although the risks to growth are fairly even these uncertainties could push underlying inflation above our 2.4% forecast by the end of 2001.\" </p> <p>Like the City, the CBI is concerned that unless consumer spending slows soon to make room for the extra demand created by higher public spending, the Bank of England could be forced to raise rates again from 6% to damp down inflationary pressure. </p> <p>But Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said the \"leads and lags\" in getting the spending plans through Whitehall could delay imple mentation. \"There's a lot of uncertainty in this new planning environment. It's not clear how departments will react to it,\" she said. </p> <p>Under the new system government departments plan their spending over three years rather than one, tying the cash to the achievement of targets for service delivery. </p> <p>Labour's second spending review, published in July, included a sharp rise in capital expenditure from 0.3% of gross domestic product in 1999-2000 to 1.8% by 2003-04. </p> <p>However, ministers are still sitting on unspent cash from previous Treasury allocations. In June it emerged that capital expenditure by the state was down 50% compared with figures during the Conservatives last year in power. </p> <p>A Treasury spokesman yesterday said departments would publish clear investment strategies in the autumn showing how they would meet their public service targets. </p> <p>The CBI forecast that output would grow 3.1% this year and 2.7% next and that, based on rates being held at 6%, underlying inflation would average 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. Meanwhile, unemployment is predicted to fall to 1.41m by the end of next year.</p>",
  "Gordon Brown, the chancellor, will face a demand for a 35% increase in the statutory minimum wage to take it to \u00a35 an hour, and for the restoration of a link between pensions and earnings, when he addresses the TUC's annual conference in Glasgow next month. <p>In a statement issued today, certain to be agreed by the full congress, the TUC General Council says it believes the legal minimum of \u00a33.70 an hour has had less impact than had been expected, and should be uprated by October next year to reflect increasing earnings and to help \"close the gap between the rich and poor\". </p> <p>Although the TUC has encouraged use of the \u00a35 figure as a wage bargaining target with employers, the demand to make this figure into a legally enforceable minimum is a significant advance on its previous call for \"somewhat more than \u00a34\", and was immediately criticised as \"potentially very damaging\" by the CBI, the main employers' organisation. </p> <p>Susan Anderson, CBI human resources director, said now was \"not the time to throw caution to the wind\", following a successful introduction in April last year. </p> <p>A \u00a35 statutory minimum would increase the pay of at least 2.5m part or full time workers, she said, compared to the 1.7m covered by the existing rate. Other proposals by the TUC, to get rid of the lower rate for workers under 21 and to introduce a minimum for 16 and 17-year-olds, were, she said, \"own goals\" that would result in there being fewer jobs for young people. </p> <p>The TUC general secretary, John Monks, described the minimum wage as being one of the government's greatest achievements, but qualified this praise by saying that the 10p per hour increase to \u00a33.70 from this October was \"welcome, but not enough\". </p> <p>\"Now it is clear, despite employer warnings, that the minimum wage's impact on jobs is negligible, it should be uprated to a more realistic level,\" said Mr Monks. \"Discredited employer scaremongering should not be permanently built into its level.\" </p> <p>The government's advisory body, the low pay commission, is due to make a recommendation next summer on whether and by how much to increase the minimum. </p> <p>The chancellor is blamed by union leaders for insisting on the creation of the lower youth minimum wage and for the delay in bringing in the \u00a33.70 adult rate, and also for setting this year's increase in the state pension at 75p a week. He is consequenetly expected to try to use his speech to highlight his credentials as being in reality a friend of the labour movement. </p> <p>The final agenda for the Glasgow congress shows the government will face pressure over its part-privatisation plans for air traffic control and the London Underground, as well as its enthusiasm for using the private finance initiative in public services. </p> <p>And it will come under attack over its policies towards asylum seekers, described in a Transport and General Workers' Union motion as serving to \"further alienate, stigmatise and segregate refugees\". </p> <p>\u0095 The Ford car company has been warned by the commission for racial equality to act on pledges it gave last year regarding treatment of its black and Asian workers, following years of allegations of racism at its Dagenham plant in Essex and a employment tribunal finding of discrimination, harassment and victimisation. The commission suspended a move for a formal investigation after Ford agreed to a tight timetable of action.</p>",
  "President Vladimir Putin has made his most scathing attack on the Russian media, accusing the two top television moguls of seeking to exploit the Kursk submarine disaster to make millions and damage the armed forces. <p>Under unprecedented criticism from the Russian press for his perceived failure of leadership at a time of national tragedy, Mr Putin lashed out, threatening to punish the proprietors and fight their influence through alternative \"honest and objective\" media. </p> <p>His outburst came late on Tuesday at a closed and tightly controlled meeting in the northern navy port of Vidyayevo, where he spent almost three hours with the families of the 118 dead seamen of the Kursk. No outsiders are allowed near Vidyayevo and security in the two weeks since the disaster has been especially tight. </p> <p>Posing as relatives of the dead, two Moscow journalists from leading national newspapers, Grigori Nekhoroshev of Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Andrei Kolesnikov of Kommersant, spent several days in Vidyayevo and saw the emotional encounter between Mr Putin and 500 Kursk relatives. </p> <p>Howling at Mr Putin, widows and mothers who, along with the rest of Russia, had been glued to their television screens throughout the Kursk drama, demanded to know why they had received so much contradictory information. Mr Putin blamed television reporting, the journalists said, and then launched the strongest attack on the Russian media he has made since becoming president. </p> <p>\"They are liars. The television has people who have been destroying the state for 10 years. They have been thieving money and buying up absolutely everything,\" he said, according to Mr Nekhoroshev, a former BBC employee. </p> <p>\"Now they're trying to discredit the country so that the army gets even worse.\" </p> <p>Mr Kolesnikov believes that the Kremlin was sending a strong political signal of further pressure to come. </p> <p>In an interview on state television on Wednesday evening, Mr Putin made barely veiled threats against the two top television moguls, Boris Berezovsky, who controls the main state channel, ORT, and Vladimir Gusinsky, who owns the biggest private channel, NTV. </p> <p>Blaming the messengers while provisionally exonerating the military and political leaders for their botched handling of the Kursk disaster, Mr Putin said the media were \"unscrupulously trying to exploit this misfortune...to gain political capital\". </p> <p>In a clear reference to Mr Berezovsky and Mr Gusinsky, he said: \"They'd better sell their villas on the Mediterranean coast of France or Spain. Then they might have to explain why all this property is registered in false names under front law-firms. Perhaps we would ask them where they got the money.\" </p> <p>The Russian media have been energetically exploring the Kursk tragedy, exposing navy humbug and Kremlin cover-ups, providing the names of the dead when the authorities refused to do so, and frustrating Kremlin attempts to control the coverage. </p> <p>The second state channel, RTR, has been favoured with exclusive access to a navy cruiser at the site of the sinking. It was also given the interview with the president, and it provided the only sanctioned, and extremely restricted, pictures of Mr Putin's meeting in Vidyayevo. </p> <p>The head of RTR is Oleg Dobrodeyev, a founder of NTV in the early 90s, who broke with Mr Gusinsky earlier this year over the channel's critical coverage of the Chechen war and last year's pro-western coverage of the conflict in Kosovo.</p>",

  "<p>As students digest their A-level and GCSE results and plan their futures, many will be left pondering what rewards their new-found qualifications will deliver. There will certainly be more jobs for highly qualified people in the future - an extra 2m over the next 10 years according to new projections by the Institute for Employment Research. The trouble is, there are expected to be at least 2.2m more graduates. </p> <p>Thirty or 40 years ago, gaining some A-levels gave you a good chance of a decent job; a degree gave you hope of an even better one. Things have changed. With participation in higher education double what it was only 10 years ago, having a degree is increasingly becoming a necessity rather than a bonus. </p> <p>Gaining an A-level qualification still increases your chances of commanding a higher salary - around 18% higher than someone with GCSEs only. For women, the pay bonus attached to having A-levels is even greater (although pay levels for women still lag behind men's). But A-levels are no longer sufficient to gain a professional, managerial or even administrative job; a degree is rapidly becoming a standard requirement. </p> <p>The pace of change is accelerating. Twenty years ago, just one in eight corporate administrators were graduates. Today, it is around a third, and by 2009 it is projected to be more than two-fifths. Just one in 20 buyers, brokers and sales reps were graduates in 1981, but by 2009 it will be one in seven. A third of managers are expected to be graduates by the end of the decade. </p> <p>Having a degree matters more than the type of degree you have. Qualifications are still primarily a way for employers to see who the brightest people are, rather than evidence of specific skills. Employers are increasingly demanding more generalised skills in the workplace, with greater emphasis being put on communication, IT and problem-solving skills, but there is still little evidence of the new vocational degree courses - such as business and management studies - being seen as reflecting these new skills. </p> <p>Holding a traditional degree is still seen by employers as a proxy for generic skills: the ability to learn, to lead a team and negotiate. If anything, it is science and engi neering graduates who are in shortest supply and have been seeing the biggest pay rises in recent years, but this is more to do with the demand for high-level numeracy skills than a shortage of scientists and engineers. Arts and humanities graduates tend to earn less than people from courses such as law, medicine, maths and computing, at least in their first job, but these differences are dwarfed by the gap between the lifetime earnings of graduates and non-graduates. </p> <p>The projections for the oversupply of graduates could turn out to be an underestimate. The government's public-service agreement targets, released with last month's spending review, include increasing participation in higher education \"towards 50% of those aged 18-30 by the end of the decade\". The 2.2m figure assumes the current level of one-third, so the true figure could end up significantly higher. Even without allowing for this extra increase, by 2009 30% of the entire workforce will have qualifications to at least \"level 4\" - which includes higher education diplomas and vocational courses like HNDs and BTEC. A-levels count as level 3; a degree, teaching or nursing qualification as level 5. </p> <p>More and more graduates may have to settle for jobs outside the traditional graduate sector. And it is outside the graduate sector that job growth will be much slower. The number of skilled trade jobs is expected to fall by 270,000 over the next decade. The number of administrative and clerical jobs will shrink too. However, there will be strong growth in job opportunities on the fringes of the professions. </p> <p>More than 800,000 new jobs will be in what are called \"associate professional and technical\" occupations. This means people like physiotherapists and radiographers instead of doctors; financial analysts and tax advisers instead of accountants; welfare officers instead of qualified social workers. It also includes technicians and specialists in areas like IT and engineering. </p> <p>If all else fails, graduates might consider sticking to their holiday jobs. There is predicted to be significant growth in part-time jobs during the next 10 years. And the personal service sector is booming: there will be nearly half a million more jobs in this area by the end of the decade. Students might increasingly find themselves having to rely on their temporary catering and bar jobs for longer than they expected. </p> <p>Access to higher education will become increasingly important in the future. With wage differentials between the top and bottom rising, and with most of the training at work going to people who already have qualifications, the price of missing out will become ever higher. </p> <p>For those who do get in, a degree is no longer a passport to a top job, but it will at least be a way into a much-expanded range of white-collar jobs, including many that were not around when their parents left school. </p> <p> Nick Burkitt is researcher on the future of work at the Institute for Public Policy Research.</p>",
  "The Gulf Air plane which crashed off Bahrain on Wednesday was unable to lower its nose wheel for landing, sources quoted by a Bahraini newspaper claimed yesterday. <p>All 143 people on board - including two Britons - died as the Airbus A320 plunged into the sea after two attempts to land.</p> <p>According to the sources, Captain Ihsan Shakeeb told the control tower that he could not release the front wheel, and was told to circle the airport and try again. But two further attempts failed.</p> <p>Earlier, a statement by Gulf Air said: \"Approximately one nautical mile from touchdown and at about 600ft [185 metres] above sea level the aircraft commenced a go-around.\"</p> <p>It gave no reason for the decision to make a circuit.</p> <p>David Learmount, a safety expert at Flight International magazine, said the statement indicated that the plane was flying too high and probably too fast for a normal landing; one mile from touchdown it should have been at 300 feet.</p> <p>He said: \"If the pilot was flying on purpose at 600ft, a problem with the landing gear would fit the scenario.\"</p> <p>But he said this would not lead to an attempt to ditch the plane in the sea.</p> <p>\"They would lay a carpet of foam on the runway. Landing without wheels causes surprisingly little damage - planes very often fly again within six months.\"</p> <p>Another reason for making a circuit would be that the pilot had found himself too high by accident, possibly as a result of problems with air traffic control.</p> <p>A circuit involves a lot of work for the pilot, Mr Learmount said.</p> <p>\"You have to pull the nose up, put power on, bring the gear up and adjust the flaps. It shouldn't be a problem, but there have been quite a few examples in the last 10 years of pilots getting it wrong.\"</p> <p>But he added: \"I have no reason to conclude this was pilot error from the information available.\"</p> <p>The names of people killed in accidents are not normally released until their families have been informed, but the Bahrain Tribune published a full list on its website yesterday while Foreign Office officials were still trying to contact relatives of one of the two Britons who died.</p> <p>The two were later named as Aileen Woods, 28, a resident of Bahrain, and Christopher Keenan, who lived in Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>Relatives of the 65 Egyptians killed in the crash left Cairo for Bahrain in a chartered plane yesterday to identify the bodies and bring them home for burial. Dozens of doctors and nurses and five ambulances were on hand to deal with grieving relatives, many of whom fainted or became hysterical</p> <p>The bereaved women among the 135 relatives were all dressed in black. A few who were unable to walk the short distance to the aircraft were pushed in a wheelchair.</p> <p>An official said there were 38 children under 12 on the ill-fated airliner.</p>",
  "For nearly 50 years, Rabbi Henoch Dov Padwa, who has died aged 91, led the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations in London with firmness and a keen sense of humour. <p>At a time when ultra-orthodoxy in Judaism was under scrutiny and attack both in Israel and Britain, he saw the union grow in strength, and become a formidable force with numerous institutions. His spiritual leadership was effective because he was among the world's outstanding Talmudic scholars, and a man to whom even well-known rabbis deferred. </p> <p>While secular and less observant Jews might see the way of life of the ultra- orthodoxy as narrow and closed, Padwa saw it as rich and ennobling. Intense study of the Torah, the sacred law, the Talmud and the commentaries were seen by him, his followers and congregations as the foremost aim of life. </p> <p>Union congregations in north London venerated this gentle, white-haired rabbi, and readily accepted his decisions. He was dismissive of some modern inventions, worried that they might prove a source of corruption. Thus, while radio was tolerated, he banned the use of videos. In a letter to the community, he wrote: \"There is no estimating the danger caused to godliness, and the education of boys and girls, by having a video recorder in the home. This is an opening for sinning and the destruction of humanity and modesty.\" In an age when celebrations tended to be exorbitant, he exhorted his community to \"act modestly\", and always to emphasise the spiritual side of any gathering. </p> <p>Padwa was born in Busk, Galicia, which is now in Ukraine. As a boy, he was taken by his parents to Vienna, and later studied at talmudical seminaries in Hungary and Poland. He returned to Vienna to head a congregation but, when the Germans annexed Austria in 1938, he was arrested as an alien and imprisoned. On being released, he just managed to board the very last ship bound for Palestine - it was literally leaving the harbour as he arrived, and he had to be rushed to the ship by a small boat. </p> <p>In Jerusalem, Padwa's stature as a scholar and leader was quickly recognised by the Charedi ultra-orthodox community. He was made a dayan (or judge) of the Broder synagogue and given jurisdiction over a number of institutions. When the Arab-Israel war broke out in 1948, he remained in Jerusalem during the Jordanian siege of the Old City. </p> <p>Padwa was to have an influential voice in the affairs of the ultra-orthodox communi ties of the new state of Israel. Large number of rabbis had died in the Holocaust, and men of his standing were eagerly sought. Great ultra-orthodox congregations had been destroyed in Europe, and Padwa was among those who were determined to ensure that new, dedicated communities would arise, and that there would be young people to carry on the traditions of learning and piety. </p> <p>In 1955, Padwa was invited to become principal rabbinical authority of the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations in London, at a time when the union needed a man who was both an outstanding scholar and a leader. Significantly, it was to Padwa that Chief Rabbi Dr Jonathan Sacks addressed, in January 1997, his controversial letter sharply criticising the religious beliefs of the leading reform rabbi, Hugo Gryn, who had just died. The letter led to a major dispute among the Jewish communities in Britain. </p> <p>Padwa, who was buried in Jerusalem, is survived by his third wife, Reisel, three sons and two daughters. His successor as the head of the union is his son, Rabbi Elrayim Padwa. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Henoch Dov Padwa, rabbi, born August 17 1908; died August 16 2000</p>",
  "The 10th Baron Vernon, who has died aged 77, was a very deviant hereditary peer. He was a liberal pro- European, supported abortion and opposed apartheid. Of his 22 votes in the Lords in 1984-85, 21 were against the Thatcher government. He was also one of the first ex-Tory peers to join the Social Democratic Party. <p>Given his background, his views were all the more striking. He was born in a stately home - Sudbury Hall, in Derbyshire - to an aristocratic family that stretched back to the Norman conquest. He had the education (Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford), war experience (captain in the Scots Guards) and occupations (M15 and Colonial Office) that should have guaranteed his status. </p> <p>But from his maiden speech in the House of Lords - on Africa in 1965 - Vernon showed a combination of liberalism and hard-headed realism. He hated apartheid, but feared economic sanctions would not work. His solution was to divide South Africa between whites and blacks with a fair distribution of its wealth. He was similarly realistic about dealing with Rhodesia, ridiculing nominal sanctions against a regime backed by South Africa, while accepting that military action by Britain was unrealistic. </p> <p>In 1967, his strong support for David Steel's abortion bill again set him aside from his Conservative colleagues. He showed particular concern that rich people could readily have safe, if illegal, abortions, while poor women had to take the risk of backstreet ones. </p> <p>Vernon was also concerned about over-population, particularly in Africa, which he had come to know during his time with the Colonial Office. In 1980, he proposed that development aid should be coupled to population control. In 1985, he urged that \u00a31m of the \u00a350m raised by Live Aid be devoted to birth control. He followed this up by becoming chairman of Population Concern, from 1984 to 1989, supporting birth control overseas. </p> <p> The only area in which Vernon remained traditionally conservative was in his hostility to the National Trust experts who insisted on restoring Sudbury Hall to its original, mid-17th century colouring, ignoring its evolution as his family home. In 1971, he accused the trust of being \"too ready to destroy the character of houses built up over the centuries\". </p> <p>Vernon could have been excused for having special memories of the place. He was looked after there for his first eight years by his nanny, rather than by his father, the 9th baron, or his mother, Violet. At eight, he was sent off to prep school and Eton. When he inherited in 1963, he found that the farming estate could not pay the hall's upkeep, so he offered it to the National Trust, and moved into a smaller house nearby. </p> <p>Although he continued to manage the estate with sensitivity, this was not what he had trained for, nor was it his main interest. After war service, he had studied for the bar at Lincoln's Inn, but went into M15 (1950-55) before being seconded to the Cabinet Office and then the Colonial Office until 1961, serving first in Kenya, probably as an intelligence officer. For British intelligence operatives, the key question was whether Britain could keep African nationalists on side sufficiently to keep them out of Soviet hands. </p> <p>Vernon's appreciation of the African scene was such that he saw decolonisation as inevitable. He co-founded the insightful African Newsletter, and also Soviet Analysis. </p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Sally, and by a daughter from his first marriage to Sheila. Their other daughter, the novelist Frances Vernon, died in 1991. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 John Lawrance Vernon, 10th Baron Vernon, born February 1 1923; died August 19 2000</p>",
  "Marietta Soares did not have to speak to show that she was afraid of being caught talking to a white man. Continually glancing around, she was shaking as she described her family's plight, effectively held hostage for the past 11 months in a squalid refugee camp just inside Indonesian West Timor. <p>\"My three children and I get enough food for three helpings of rice each a day,\" she said. \"Occasionally we get a few vegetables or some dried fish, but they don't allow us go out to find our own food. We can only do what they let us and we rarely get any news except what they tell us. </p> <p>\"We really want to go home to East Timor, but it is impossible. They will beat us or maybe even kill us if we try. Even talking to you risks punishment.\" </p> <p>\"They\" are the militia, a mixture of East Timorese paramilitaries who support the Indonesian government in Jakarta, West Timorese thugs, and current and former members of the Indonesian armed forces. Feeling angry and betrayed by East Timor's overwhelming vote for independence last August after 25 years of Indonesian occupation, they are fighting a desperate campaign to try to reverse their defeat. </p> <p>Their aim is to win the right to create an Indonesian region in western East Timor. There is a political wing, the Heroes of Timorese Unity, which denies the militia existence and stresses that its campaign is a purely peaceful one. </p> <p>Their strategy is two pronged. The first is to use the remaining 130,000 of the refugees who fled militia violence in East Timor last year as a bargaining chip by preventing them returning to East Timor or - as tens of thousands wish to, building a new life in Indonesia. </p> <p>This is done by brute force and a skillful disinformation campaign, telling them that East Timor is so unsafe that people are flooding back to West Timor. While the forces of law and order in East Timor are far from complete, the territory is calm. </p> <p>The second part of the strategy involves fighting a guerrilla war in western East Timor against the international peacekeeping force. </p> <p><b> UN officials attacked </b><br> </p> <p> \"It took about six months for the militia and their army backers to regroup and plan a new strategy,\" said one of the few international aid workers still in Atambua, the town about five miles from the border where most of the refugee camps are located. </p> <p>\"During this time about 150,000 refugees returned to East Timor. But since April the militia have been escalating their campaign of terror and intimidation against both the refugees and the United Nations.\" </p> <p>This reached a new peak on Tuesday when, during a visit to what was considered to be one of the safest camps in West Timor,representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were deliberately attacked for the first time. All three were beaten so badly that they needed hospital treatment and one, a local man called Gotlief, was lucky to escape with his life. </p> <p>\"At one point a group of about a dozen were hitting me with sticks and throwing stones at me as I was lying on the ground,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Then I heard one of them speaking my own local language so I shouted back that I am from the same small island as him and he ordered them to stop attacking me. If he had not done so, I would have been killed.\" </p> <p>As a result of the attack, the UNHCR has decided to suspend its operations in West Timor. \"We've been pushing for improved security since October but none of our demands have been met,\" said Jake Morland, the UNHCR spokesman in West Timor. </p> <p>\"The actions of the army and police amount to peanuts. They allow the militia to act with impunity and have not bothered to disarm the militias or arrest those responsible for the terror, intimidation and beatings.\" </p> <p>Two recent incidents exemplify the Indonesian army's attitude to the militia and the UNHCR. A day after seizing about a dozen semi-automatic rifles in a sweep of refugee camps around Atambua earlier this month, the army returned the weapons. The commander said he was afraid there would be a riot if he did not give them back. </p> <p>His counterpart in Kefamenanu, a town 55 miles west of Atambua, said this week that the UNHCR would only be allowed to keep vehicles on his base, as a security precaution, if they paid him rent for the parking spaces. </p> <p>The armed forces have made no concerted effort to stop the militiamen blocking the main road from Atambua to the East Timorese border. </p> <p> These barricades have been erected not only to stop the refugees sneaking back home, but also to starve the East Timorese into yielding to the militia's demands, according to a militiaman armed with a machete on one roadblock. </p> <p>\"[East Timorese leader] Xanana [Gusmao] said he would be happy to be independent even if he has to eat stones,\" he said. \"Well, let's see how they feel when we force them to really eat stones and drink their own piss.\" </p> <p>The militia's guerrilla war in East Timor began in April with short, sharp hit-and-run raids on communities just across the border. Now their its involve sending squads of well-armed and well-trained fighters deeper into the territory. At least eight are known to be operating at the moment, some as far as 60 miles into East Timor. </p> <p><b> Bitter fruit of darkness</b><br> </p> <p> \"The ones in our area are like Japanese ninjas,\" UN soldier in East Timor said. \"They are dressed all in black with white neckscarves. They carry modern weapons and lots of ammunition.\" </p> <p>So far the militia squads have not singled out civilians, except for food, and have killed only two international peacekeepers. But they have caused fear in many communities. </p> <p>It is unclear who is leading the militia. Diplomatic sources in Jakarta say they have accumulated conclusive evidence that several elements of the Indonesian army,particularly the special forces, are the driving force behind the campaign. </p> <p>The UN administrator in East Timor, Sergio Vieria de Mello, says he is confident that the threat will not last long. \"They are and will be made ever more irrelevant here and in Indonesia,\" he told local politicians this week. \"They belong to the past when irrational violence and force of weapons, not arguments, prevailed. They were the bitter fruit of darkness, and they shall return to it.\" </p> <p>But feelings in West Timor are more sombre. \"Unless the Indonesian government shows serious political will, the refugees could be stuck here for at least another year,\" Mr Morland said. </p> <p>The Indonesian deputy foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, admits there is a crisis but says it is very difficult to solve. \"This is not just a simple case of dealing with a few thugs,\" he said during a tour of East and West Timor this week. \"It is a complex problem involving many social issues, so what we need is a comprehensive solution.\" </p> <p>He proposes to greatly increase the number of Indonesian security troops in the border region to deal with the militia threat,close the camps, and put the refugees into transit centres for eventual return to East Timor or settlement in in Indonesia, according to their wishes. </p> <p>\"Our problem is that we do not have enough resources and so we are appealing to the international community for help,\" he said. </p> <p>But the international community is not backing the plan as it stands. \"If they close the camps forcibly, against the wishes of the refugees, it could be catastrophic,\" Mr Morland said. </p> <p>Meanwhile' tens of thousands of innocent victims like Marietta Soares continue to suffer. </p> <p>\"We aren't politicians,\" she said. \"We are just simple people who want to go home.\"</p>",
  "Zenon Cruz bites another coca leaf from its stem, tongues it into the wad already bulging in his cheek and scowls up at the army helicopter hovering above the jungle canopy. \"My father sowed coca and his father sowed it before him,\" mutters the peasant farmer, his teeth stained green. \"What the Americans do not understand is that this leaf is a gift from mother earth to our people, an ancient tradition. They do not understand its sacredness. They think it is all about drugs.\" <p>Like the majority of campesinos gathered at this roadside protest in the tropical Chapare region of Bolivia, 29-year-old Cruz has watched a US-backed eradication squad hack away his entire crop and his main source of income. </p> <p>Last year alone, the soldiers destroyed a record 17,000 hectares in the region and by the end of this year aim to finish off the remaining 3,000, in a drive to strangle the US drugs problem at source. </p> <p>The Bolivian government, under huge funding incentives from the US (it must be seen to be meeting drug eradication targets to qualify for development aid), calls the strategy Operation Dignity. Cruz and his struggling fellow farmers call it cultural genocide. </p> <p>Andean peoples were using this hardy plant for a variety of ritual and health purposes for thousands of years before white men first learned to extract cocaine from it. Rich in vitamins and minerals, the leaves have traditionally been used to treat ailments ranging from dysentery to altitude sickness. The vast majority of Bolivians still chew them daily, mixing them with ash to create an anaesthetic effect on the stomach to ward off hunger. Death, marriage, and almost any other social or religious ritual here will include an offering of coca. </p> <p>\"Guard its leaves with love,\" warns Legend of Coca, the 800-year-old oral poem. \"And when you feel pain in your heart, hunger in your flesh and darkness in your mind, lift it to your mouth. You will find love for your pain, nourishment for your body and light for your mind.\" </p> <p>But the seers also foretold that white man would find a way to subvert their \"small but strong\" plant: \"If your oppressor arrives from the north, the white conqueror, the gold seeker, when he touches it he will find only poison for his body and madness for the mind.\" </p> <p>What the seers did not predict was the scale of the backlash. White man duly succeeded in extracting the 0.5% alkaloid cocaine from the coca leaf at the end of the 19th century - Dr Sigmund Freud become the first to contract nasal cancer from snorting it - and all hell broke loose. </p> <p>Eradication attempts first began in 1949 after a study by a North American banker, Howard Fonda, claimed that the chewing of the plant was \"responsible for mental deficiency and poverty in Andean countries\". Soon afterwards, in 1961, the United Nations placed coca on schedule one, branding it one of the most dangerous and restricted drugs. Of course, this had no effect on US cocaine use, as executives snorted lines while the ghettos opted for its cheaper and more dangerous relative, crack. By the 80s, more than half the world's cocaine was being consumed by the superpower, which has just 5% of the global population. Bolivia, one of the world's poorest nations, saw an opening in the market and filled it. It was to become the world's second largest producer of coca and cocaine paste. </p> <p>Now, under the concerted eradication first initiated by Ronald Reagan in his war on drugs, it is payback time. Bolivia is being punished for its recent complicity with the destruction of its ancient culture. </p> <p>Not without a fight, however. \"Go home Yankees!\" shouts a furious Quechua woman in a bright shawl and bowler hat, marching with hundreds of others under banners calling for farmers' human rights to be respected. The helicopter keeps its distance, and the DEA officials rarely show their faces outside the confines of the nearby army base. </p> <p>Zenon Cruz denies supplying the drug barons with his coca, but admits there were plenty who did. At the height of the trade, light aircraft landed regularly on these roads to pick up consignments. \"But they are punishing us all - legal and illegal together - and everyone is struggling,\" he says. </p> <p>Coca, a hardy plant ideally suited to tired or eroded soil, could produce three or four harvests a year. Now forced to grow beans and oranges instead, as part of a US-funded \"alternative development\" plan, Zenon must feed his family on a fraction of his former income. \"You can fill a lorry with oranges and not sell any of them at market, but coca always sells like hot bread,\" he says. \"I was making 150 bolivianos [about \u00a320] a week before they cut down the coca. Now we sometimes struggle to make 20 [\u00a33]. How can you feed a family on that?\" </p> <p>Other families still risk everything for a higher income. A few miles down the road, at the military base in Chimore, a 16-year-old local girl is being paraded before the press. Alcira Marin has just cracked after three days of interrogation and admitted to smuggling coca paste inside her body. The evidence lies in 40 pellets wrapped in yellowed clingfilm, on a table beside her. \"I was paid 300 bolivianos [\u00a340] to do it,\" she mumbles. \"I didn't know I would die if one broke inside me.\" Under the country's harsh and US-influenced Law 1008, she faces between five and eight years in prison. </p> <p>Later, in thick jungle barely 10 minutes walk from the main trunk road, Captain Luis Castro, of Bolivia's elite US-funded counter-narcotics police force, Umopar, shows me a cocaine pit his patrol have discovered this morning. In a six-metre polythene trough, heaps of fresh coca leaves lie half-trodden into greenish pulp, while older, browner leaves are piled a metre high at the edge of the jungle clearing. The workers, whoever they were, have disappeared, probably warned by two-way radio. \"Burn it!\" says Castro to his khaki-clad men, who begin scooping gasoline from a plastic separation tank hung between stakes. </p> <p>\"Judging by the amount of used coca here, I'd say they were working constantly for about three months,\" he tells me. Typically, eight men would stomp around this trough for 12 hours to turn more than 350kg of leaves, mixed with kerosene, into 1kg of pastabase, the crude paste from which cocaine must in turn be refined. Most would expect to earn up to \u00a33 an hour, which is certainly tempting when you compare it with \u00a33 a week for growing oranges. </p> <p>At an order from Castro, a man pulls the pin on an incendiary bomb and tosses it into the centre of the pit, sending flames and smoke billowing upwards towards the jungle canopy. \"We use their own gasoline to put them out of business,\" says Castro, whose cohorts have destroyed 275 similar pits in the first six months of this year alone. \"We're not going to lose to the drugs people.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that the net is tightening, but the effect may simply be to drive up prices and encourage new markets elsewhere. Anti-drugs police estimate that the little more than three tons of pastabase will leave the Chapare this year, but this alone will generate some $4m, thanks to a 300% price increase over the last three years. Critics of the eradication policy argue that it will simply drive producers further into the Bolivian Amazon region, or elsewhere in South America where an estimated 2.5m square miles lie ripe for production. </p> <p>\"It's simply the law of supply and demand,\" says Kathryn Ledebur, co-ordinator of the Andean Information Network, a human rights watchdog publicising problems with the eradication effort. \"It's pointless trying to stop production in the producer countries - the place to fight it is where the market is.\" The bigger picture is indeed discouraging. While Bolivia has fallen from second to third largest cocaine exporter behind Colombia and Peru, there has been almost no reduction in the amount of cocaine exported to the US and Europe, according to the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board. The explanation is that production has increased in Brazil and Colombia, where the governments have little control over their tropical territories. </p> <p>\"It's an obvious case of the balloon theory in operation,\" says Ledebur, who is an American. \"You squeeze it in one place and it'll just expand in another unless you tackle root demand. Instead we've got a war focused on the poor people, and it is not working.\" </p> <p>On a terraced hillside in the fertile Yungas valleys on the other side of the country, a small boy dressed in traditional poncho and woollen cap kneels to make his offering to Pachamama, or mother nature. As he unwraps a cloth full of coca leaves, lights an incense burner and sprinkles alcohol on the ground, other children come forward to sing in Quechua: </p> <p>Green coca, you are born of our land/Your fragrance makes us sing happily/In the fields among the mountains/My little coca leaf is sweet medicine/Not a drug that does damage/We suck your juices for help in our work. </p> <p>It is part celebration, part pre-emptive protest. The families of this region, the last remaining place of legal coca cultivation in Bolivia, know things could easily go the way of the Chapare for them. While Law 1008 currently provides for 12,000 hectares for traditional coca-growing and distribution in the Yungas, US officials have been arguing that less than half that is needed for chewing or ritual uses. \"There is evidence that Yungas coca is being diverted to the illicit market for conversion to cocaine products,\" says the latest US embassy report on counter-narcotics. Local people believe that if they give in now, the North Americans will simply carry on demanding more until nothing is left. </p> <p>Eradication was supposed to begin here later this year, until the country exploded in violent protests over the issue in April. Coca growers dynamited the only road into the region, and the eradicators backed off - until next year. A tense impasse continues, but nobody has any illusions that they will be back. </p> <p>\"The child in the US learns that he must buy things in order to be happy, whether it's Nike trainers or a gramme of cocaine,\" says Javier Castro, curator of the coca museum in La Paz. \"That's the root of the problem, and everyone knows if they can't get their drugs here, they will just go somewhere else. In the meantime, they want to wipe out coca completely - it's a kind of cultural genocide. It's going to be as if we have no soul, no spirit.\" </p> <p>Castro is one of many who have fought to have the coca leaf recognised as a potential health product rather than a schedule one drug. Western backpackers here drink coca tea constantly to ward off altitude sickness, and a Harvard University study found that 100g of Bolivian coca more than satisfied the recommended daily allowances of calcium, iron, phosphorus, vitamin A and riboflavin. </p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, the burst of energy it gives comes not from the 0.5 cocaine content - this is in fact destroyed by saliva in the digestive tract, which is why cocaine users must snort or inject - but from its conversion of carbohydrates into glucose, and its stimulation of the respiratory system. </p> <p>With at least 30 coca products already available in Bolivia, ranging from toothpaste to pick-me-up pastilles, campaigners argue that there is considerable potential for salvaging the livelihoods of many thousands of poor farmers by marketing the plant in the west. </p> <p>But the only company which has managed to get round the ban is the Stepan company of the US. In one of the howling ironies of the coca war, it legally imports 175,000 kilos of Chapare coca each year to manufacture, among other things, a de-cocainised flavouring for Coca-Cola.</p>",
  "You argue (Leader, August 24) that the Industrial Society's idea of equalising parental rights rather than extending maternity rights is \"close to utopian\" and \"a waste of legislative effort\", because male identity is too closely tied up with career success for them to use such leave - implying the state would have to wait for a cultural shift before it introduced such policies. <p>Evidence from other countries suggests, however, that the state can lead cultural change. In Norway, where a portion of parental leave is allocated to the father and lost by the couple if it is not used, paternal take up rates increased from 45% in 1994 to 80% in 1996, when 68% of leave-takers took the full month allowed to them. Sixty-one per cent of Norwegian fathers now think that the paternity quota should be extended to eight weeks. </p> <p>Dr Sarah Ashwin, London </p> <p>\u0095The Industrial Society's attack on a better deal for working mothers (Family plan 'will make parents worse off', August 23) is disappointing from an organisation with a proud record of supporting better conditions for people at work. Some bad employers continue to discriminate against mothers and will continue to do so whether or not there are marginal improvements in maternity provision. But people already prepared to break the law should not be allowed to dictate the terms of future social advance </p> <p>In fact, many more women with small children are working today than 10 years ago. The best employers make an investment in all their employees and go to great lengths to attract women back after maternity leave. Of course working parents need a better deal. Indeed everyone at work - with or without caring responsibilities - needs a better balance between work and the rest of their life, and protection against the long-hours culture. Sweeping generalisations do little to help working mothers or fathers. </p> <p>John Monks, General secretary, TUC </p>",
  "The Chinese police have cracked down on a rural Christian sect, detaining three foreign missionaries for allegedly breaking the law in Henan province, a northern region noted for its religious fervour and diversity. <p>Up to 130 members of the protestant Fangcheng church, which believes in the literal truth of the Bible, were arrested, according to reports reaching Hong Kong.</p> <p>The police in Xihua county confirmed that about 100 people were interrogated on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, in Hong Kong, said three Chinese-American missionaries from California were among those arrested.</p> <p>The Fangcheng church was founded in the town of that name and has spread throughout Henan.</p> <p>Its spiritual leader, Zhang Rongliang, was sentenced to two years in a labour camp last December for \"leading a cult\", but was released on medical parole.</p> <p>Fangcheng was the target of a campaign in the early 1990s by a US missionary movement, which advertised for Asian volunteers who could pass as Chinese and were willing to smuggle Bibles and tracts in their luggage.</p> <p>The movement called them \"donkeys for Jesus\".</p> <p>All forms of religion are popular in the Henan countryside, and peasants in the province have been denounced for building too many Buddhist and Taoist temples.</p>"
