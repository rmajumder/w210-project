  "<p>Forty-eight hours earlier the Oval bulged with spectators, vibrant with amiable chauvinism and all the outward signs of rediscovered Test triumph. Yesterday this same ground, in sweeping contrast, conveyed just about as much sporting emotion and aura as if it were still the original market garden, ingeniously converted to cricket in the 1840s. </p> <p>It was as if Surrey were cruising to their latest Championship success in a vacuum. Wide banks of seats were empty, like a theatre after a play had closed, and only the warm memories remained. </p> <p>Historically Surrey's cricket can too easily carry a blas\u00e9 mood. Perhaps they have won the title too often, too predictably. </p> <p>For seven years in a row during the 50s they were invincible. Lock and Laker spun the ball, Surridge barked the orders and May on-drove like a dream. They were not always popular but they were the best. </p> <p>Now, despite the hypotheses that persist as Lancashire, in pursuit, prepare in hope for their game with Somerset which starts tomorrow, Surrey are decided favourites to win the title for the second year in succession. </p> <p>Durham, their hapless opponents, appear destined to move in the other direction. </p> <p>It should be said that Surrey are going about their business with suitably haughty and assertive intention. Mark Butcher and Ian Ward batted for the whole of the day, taking out the 33 overs lost to rain. </p> <p>By the close they had both scored hundreds and Surrey were 243 without loss. The partnership was then two short of the record for the first wicket against Durham. </p> <p>They had consistently driven crisply through the offside, Butcher marginally reaching his century - with 16 fours - ahead of Ward. It was a day of two batsmen in control and not too much more. </p> <p>Durham's brief first-class history has been at times valiant, seldom distinguished. The turnover of players has been numerous. In the one- day competitions, they have got no further than the quarter-finals; their surprise progression to the First Division for this season was seen as either lucky or presumptuous by those who chose to patronise the relative newcomers. </p> <p>They have recently fired their captain Nick Speak, who is now left out of the side and whose future as a Durham player, with a year remaining on his contract, must be uncertain. </p> <p>The county do not lack ideas, as they revealed again when sounding out John Emburey for a brief comeback as a player. But, in any case, the crafty old off-spinner has his sights ambitiously on Lord's as Mike Gatting's successor as coach. At his age he would have welcomed the offer of a wider brief at Riverside. </p> <p>The Durham bowling against Surrey was altogether more persevering than challenging. </p> <p>Steve Harmison, for whom not too much has gone right this summer, was again a disappointment. </p> <p>There was a surfeit of wides and wayward control; his speed seemed a meagre compensation. Injury has worked against him. </p> <p>It had been a good toss for Surrey to win. The bowlers extracted little to help them. Ward was once nearly caught in the slips and Butcher, on 93, was perilously close to being run out by Jimmy Daley after being called for a single.</p>",
  "<p>A whoop from the bowler, a cheer verging on the apologetic, a mid-pitch huddle, a gentle ripple of applause and the deed was done. If the feat warranted a spot of boogeying in the streets of Kettering and Corby, the low-key reality was perfectly in keeping with the unassuming soul of county cricket. </p> <p>By gleaning the second of the requisite bonus points, Northamptonshire had become the first side ever to win promotion in the championship. With due inevitability, moreover, the agent provocateur was Jason Brown, whose irrepressibility over the past two months has fired his club's surge from basement to penthouse. </p> <p>Phil Sharpe, the pitch liaison officer, stayed overnight, a party pooper-in-waiting, but this surface ill-deserves a guilty verdict. The Englishman's aversion to balls that deviate off the straight and narrow was far more culpable. </p> <p>The groundwork had been laid, equally predictably, by Darren Cousins. He it was who, after the Essex openers had reached 50 in 11 overs, made the initial incision against his former county, drawing Paul Prichard into a slashing drive for Adrian Rollins to swoop deftly at gully to intercept. </p> <p>More significant, if less typical, was the throw that ran out Ronnie Irani, ending the one substantial stand of an innings that went from robust to ragged in only marginally more time than it took Apollo 11 to get from 0 to 60. </p> <p>Cousins makes no bones about it. When Essex informed him they had no further need of his services, he wept. Granted, a chronic back condition had restricted the county's young player of the year for 1994 to 15 first-class outings in six seasons but that did little to alleviate the heartache. Yesterday's contribution will scarcely have hurt the recuperative process. He has now picked up 58 wickets this season, more than twice his tally at Chelmsford. </p> <p>Bold enough to disdain a helmet, Law had added 78 with Irani for the fourth wicket when Cousins interceded; the captain would have been justified in suing, so needless was the single his partner demanded. Stephen Peters, furthermore, was soon caught at bat-pad off Graeme Swann by Rollins, whose dive scored a 9.9 for artistic impression and 6.3 on the Richter scale. </p> <p>Brown had appeared a mite lethargic towards the end of his first spell, a rare wicketless one, but he made amends now. Two balls after eliciting a caught-behind decision against Law - who took so long to vacate the premises one was tempted to wonder whether he had trodden on a tube of Araldite - he did likewise to Ashley Cowan. In his next over he trapped Tim Mason, arm-ball to the fore, and, when Swann ejected Ricky Anderson in similar fashion, five men had gone for 13. </p> <p>The death-knell sounded when Peter Such's swish middled the evening air, Brown having claimed four for nine in 34 balls. As Ollie Milburn and Freddie Brown looked down approvingly, there must have been a little bit of a cavort on the streets of heaven.</p>",
  "The excuses are familiar: I've got a headache, I'm too tired, it's the wrong time of the month. But now it's not just women who are finding reasons for avoiding sex. Contradicting age-old assumptions, more and more men are going off it and some of them are prepared to say so, in public and at length. The traditional male terror, not being able to get an erection, is being edged aside by men who say they feel used, abused and treated as sex objects - just like women 20 years ago. <p>Sex therapists say this piece of role reversal has been going on for some time, long enough to start showing up in the statistics. But it was dramatically highlighted this week by the revelations of Jimmy Gulzar, estranged husband of Spice Girl Mel B, who has confided to the Sun that he refused to have sex with his wife for the final three months of their marriage. Another man, Alan Quigley, got into the tabloids last week when it was revealed, during a court case, that he wrote to his ex-girlfriend complaining that he felt like a \"typical woman\", only wanted for his body. </p> <p>This kind of problem is rarely discussed so openly but there is no doubt that it is cropping up more often. Julia Cole, a Relate-trained couple counsellor and author of After The Affair: How To Build Trust and Love Again, says that research carried out for Relate in 1996 showed that 7-8% of men seeking counselling said they had gone off sex. These were not, she points out, men with medical problems which meant they could not get an erection. For one reason or another - tiredness, stress, a feeling that the relationship had gone wrong - they were simply saying no to their partners. </p> <p>The latest research, says Cole, shows that the figure has doubled to 15%. \"There's been a steady climb since the 80s\", she says. \"Men want a partner who is considerate, sensitive and sensual. My experience in therapy over 12 years is that when you talk to men, they may start by saying they want more sex. But what they say after a while is that they want to be touched and caressed, in the same way as their partners.\" </p> <p>Does she mean - gulp - that men want foreplay? Yes, although not all of them realise it, says Cole. When couples are advised by sex therapists to concentrate on touching non- genital areas of the body, the men apparently find it \"a revelation\". Gulzar's problems with Scary Spice had probably gone way beyond the point where this kind of exercise could help, judging by the long list of complaints he laid bare over five pages of Monday's Sun. And he revealed a traditional male anxiety when he insisted, in inimitable tabloid style: \"I'm not gay... I went off sex after Mel put boob op before baby.\" </p> <p>What he claimed about their short union was that one partner wanted to stay at home and bring up baby Phoenix Chi while the other rushed back to their old life of late nights and clubbing, a familiar enough conflict except that this time it was the wife who wanted to party. (And who allegedly sneaked off to Los Angeles for breast enhancement surgery without telling her husband.) Gulzar said he was too angry with Mel to sleep with her again. \"For me, if my head ain't right, my willy ain't right,\" he added graphically. </p> <p>Quigley, whose ex-girlfriend went to the High Court asking for half of the house they had lived in together, complained that she had treated him like a male prostitute. \"I need to be appreciated, and not just because I can give you another orgasm,\" he declared in a letter submitted to the court. </p> <p>Gillian Walton, director of training and clinical services at London Marriage Guidance, confirms that in the early days of sex therapy this used to be a predominantly female cry for help. She believes that the problem of men feeling unloved or unappreciated was masked, in the past, by their tendency to display physical symptoms - erectile difficulties and premature ejaculation. </p> <p>\"It was a way of protecting the couple from admitting to disappointment,\" she says. What has happened since is a significant change in attitudes; sexual matters are much more in the open, women are no longer prepared to blame themselves for problems in bed, and men are less inhibited about discussing their own difficulties. Yet it is one thing for a man to admit to vulnerability and low self-esteem in private to a counsellor, and another to do it quite as publicly as Gulzar has done. </p> <p>That he is suffering from wounded pride, as well as limbering up for a bruising divorce court battle with his ex-love, is demonstrated by an incident at an awards ceremony when the American rap star Puff Daddy is said to have told him to take control of his woman. </p> <p>There is a confusion here between patriarchal attitudes, which crop up in embattled communities and account for the misogyny of rap stars like Puff Daddy and Eminem, and broader, biologically-based assumptions about male sexuality. </p> <p>One of these, the notion that male desire is almost entirely a physical phenomenon, stimulated visually and beyond men's control, still surfaces in rape cases. In the 21st century, defending barristers continue to claim that their clients could not control themselves on seeing a woman in a short skirt, a myth that is as insulting to men as it is dangerous to women. It has not been helped by the modish discipline of evolutionary psychology, whose most extreme exponents claim that men are genetically-programmed to rape in order to maximise the number of their offspring. </p> <p>The most recent claim of the neo-Darwinians, that women are naturally promiscuous in order to get the best quality sperm, is equally reductive. For what couple counsellors are seeing, in their current practice, is men and women who complain that they do not enjoy sex when it is perfunctory, about nothing but bodies and divorced from feeling. Some of them may be husbands or boyfriends, like Gulzar, who are acutely aware of an imbalance between their own status and that of their high-achieving partners. </p> <p>Yet, what also seems to be happening is the erosion of another stereotype, the male who can perform in all circumstances given the right stimuli. \"Perhaps there is a stage when men are very young and can be up for it just by looking at a sexy picture,\" says Cole. Beyond that, she believes, the men who come to her for help want more than a fantasy about an exciting stranger. \"It's a positive development,\" she adds, \"but it does expose their vulnerability.\" </p> <p>It's also a long way from the laddish culture of pin-ups and relentless male performance we became used to in the 90s. Perhaps that explains why these changes have been taking place, over the past couple of decades, largely behind closed doors. And it says something about our age that it has taken the spectacular break-up of a pop star's marriage to reveal that men, too, sometimes need to say no.</p>",
  "<h2>Ithaka by Adele Geras (David Fickling Books, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504225\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2005/10/20/ithaka_final.jpg\" alt=\"Ithaka by Adele Geras\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=0385603916\">Buy Ithaka at the Guardian bookshop</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  This is the story of the women who wait for Odysseus to return from Troy. Of the many versions of Homer's epic, this is the first - with apologies to James Joyce - to do justice to the women in the story. It's a home, rather than a homecoming, narrative. Touching and engaging. <p> <br></p> <h2>The Rainbow Opera by Elizabeth Knox (Faber)</h2> <p>First of two books about a world in which some people are able to control dreams. A political candidate pays a corrupt dreamcatcher to give people dreams promoting his candidacy. Cousins Laura (a dreamcatcher) and Rose (who doesn't have a skill) embark on a journey to discover that not all is well with the way dreams are being used.</p> <h2>The Moth Diaries by Rachel Klein (Faber, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504226\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/06/30/mothdiaries.jpg\" alt=\"The Moth Diaries\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  With teenagers flocking to see Mean Girls at the cinema this month, it's a good time to give them this book, a more literary take on the life of a 16-year-old girl cloistered in an American boarding school. The action takes place in the 1960s, but the girls' private dramas unfold in a rarefied world, isolated from the political turmoil of the anti-war demos going on outside. The narrator's best friend, Lucy, becomes enchanted with exotic new girl Ernessa, who has a terrifying secret. The narrator's diaries record her friend's distress, and the tragedies that result. <h2>Time Switch by Matt Chamings (Faber, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Some time in the 1870s a boy invents a time machine. Then, in our time, another boy appears at the bottom of a family's garden. The story opens with a funeral in 1879, setting the tone for a tale that is scary, but also funny. This is Chamings' first book, written after he was made redundant, and it is a gripping story.</p> <h2>Poison by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Poison, stroppy adolescent par excellence, takes the blame when her baby sister is kidnapped. But this is an alternative world of phaeries and changelings. Poison sets off on a journey to rescue her sister, but soon comes up against the limits of her own willpower.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Viaduct Child by Patrick Wood (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504227\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/viaductchild.jpg\" alt=\"Viaduct Child\" width=\"128\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Dushma is a non-person, living by a railway viaduct in a London that is recognisably like our own but also scarily different. Dushma is a non-person because a scan carried out when she was still in the womb showed that there was something odd about her brain. The state doesn't like anyone who might be a burden on resources. If you are not registered, you can't go to school, see a doctor or travel on public transport . . . you don't exist. So when the police raid her flat, Dushma escapes into the disused underground tunnels, where she joins up with a gang of teenagers living on their wits. This supremely confident first novel creates an all too believable future world of iron-gloved state control. And Wood doesn't cop out with any patronising \"happy ever afters\". <br> <h2>Malka by Mirjam Pressler (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504228\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/malka.jpg\" alt=\"Malka\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  It is September 1943. In the sleepy rural Polish backwater close to the Hungarian border, Jewish doctor Hannah Mai is burying her head in the sand, convinced that the Nazis will do her and her two daughters, teenage Minna and seven-year-old Malka, no harm. Then the round-up of Jews begins. Hannah sets off with her daughters towards the border. Then Malka falls sick and, faced with a kind of Sophie's Choice, Hannah takes the one chance offered to get herself and Minna to safety on the understanding that Malka will join them later. Instead, Malka ends up in a Jewish ghetto. Based on a true story, this is a powerful tale which explores not only the Holocaust, but also the complexities of motherhood and the reflexes that make us battle to survive. <h2>Sabriel by Garth Nix (Collins, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Another fantasy novel with a strangely named heroine. But that is the only formulaic thing about Garth Nix's darkly complex novel. Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, an \"Old Kingdom\" necromancer who can cross into the land of the dead. Sabriel has inherited his gift but attends a boarding school on the other side of the wall in the New Kingdom. The dead have a nasty habit of not staying dead in the Old Kingdom. When Sabriel receives a message from her father that he is trapped in death, she crosses the wall to try to save him and finds herself face to face with the forces of darkness. Nix weaves a thrilling adventure story as Sabriel must face her fears and journey into death. The writing displays both wit and charm - a rare gift in the fantasy genre.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Massive by Julia Bell (Young Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Novels for teenagers about eating disorders can be tricky. Bell's debut novel is tough, grimy and truthful as it looks at three women in the same family with food problems. For Carmen's mum Maria, thin equals success. She despairs of her podgy teenage daughter and, when a job opportunity arises in Birmingham, she whisks Carmen away to the big city. Soon Carmen is discovering her roots, including a grandmother who equates food with affection. Bell comes at her subject with a clever obliqueness, using the dislocated experience of the strange city to reflect Maria's and Carmen's fixations on food. A small chink of hope at the end suggests that Carmen will break the vicious circle and that the legacy will not be passed on.</p> <h2>Exodus by Julie Bertagna (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504229\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/11/15/Exodus.jpg\" alt=\"Exodus by Julie Bertagna\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  It is the future. It is more than half a century since the fuel ran out, the oceans rose and drowned the cities, and the ships that supplied the island where Mara was born stopped coming. Now Mara's island is cut off and there is no future for her people. Using the defunct technology that was once the web, Mara discovers there might be a new world out there, with tall cities out of reach of the water. <br>This is a miracle of a novel, one that defies those critics who claim that teenagers don't need novels written specially for them. It has a memorable heroine, is written in stark, simple prose and uses an imaginatively created world to look at our own problems - whether it is global warming or the refugee crisis. This is a book you will remember for the rest of your life. <p> <br></p> <h2>Dovey Coe by Frances O'Roark Dowell (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the cusp of adolescence, Dovey Coe watches the world intently, feels things strongly and always speaks her mind, which can get her into trouble. Particularly when her pretty elder sister, Caroline, starts toying with the affections of Parnell Caraway, the no-good local rich boy who always gets what he wants and would like to add Caroline to his collection. Over my dead body, thinks Dovey, but it is Parnell who ends up dead and Dovey on trial for his murder.<br>Frances O'Roark Dowell's novel is a delicately written account of life as an outsider in a rural American community in the 20s. Dovey is such a wonderful, strong character that she seems to speak directly to the reader, while the writing has the wistful quality of precious, long-distant memories.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>The Haunting Of Alaizabel Cray by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Chris Wooding's novel was passed over for these pages when it was published in hardback last year on the grounds that the cover looked like a record sleeve for a heavy metal band circa 1975 and the fact that it fell into the fantasy horror genre. Big mistake. Inside is one of the most intelligent, atmospheric and spine-tingling novels published for teenagers in recent years.<br>Wooding sets his novel in a London that is most certainly in the future but feels Victorian gothic, where a sinister Masonic society is plotting to take over, a curious Jack the Ripper stalks the streets and in the Old Quarter, overrun with wolves and wych-kin, young Thaniel is doing battle against baby-snatching ghouls, the influential Fraternity and the demons we conjure for ourselves. Breathtakingly brilliant.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Warehouse by Keith Gray (Red Fox, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504230\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/07/10/warehouse.jpg\" alt=\"Warehouse\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  The Warehouse is a place you can go when you've got nowhere else to go and have run out of money, options and even hope. It may be so rundown that even the young people who call it home describe it as \"Crap Palace\", but it is a place of safety in an uncertain and often dangerous world. Particularly for 15-year-old Robbie who is being used as a punchbag by his unhappy, vicious elder brother Frank, and for poor little rich girl Amy who set out to prove to her parents that she could hack it on her own but wound up in trouble within hours of leaving home. <br>Gray's novel is cleverly structured grabbing the reader by the scruff of the neck and pulling him or her into the entwining stories of this community of outcasts. Tough, tender and true. <p> <br></p> <h2>The Journal of Danny Chaucer (Poet) by Roger Stevens (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Novels written in poetic form are big news in the US teenage fiction market, and this home-grown effort is up there with the best. Danny Chaucer is an Adrian Mole without the wimpishness or pomposity, and the gap between Danny's fantasy life and reality is wittily chronicled in a story that follows the thyth of the school year, first love and loss, and all the pains of growing up. Particularly the sledgehammer blow when his best friend goes off with Jenny, the girl of his dreams.<br>Stevens' verse is jaunty, knowing and tart and he gets right inside the dark, dark corners of the adolescent male mind. Although the verse form may take a page or two to get used to, it actually makes this an easier and less daunting book for reluctant readers than the traditional prose novel.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Fake by KK Beck (Scholastic Press, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>Danny has been having problems with his mum and unsympathetic stepdad. Even so, it comes as a shock when he is forcibly shipped off to the Utah desert to attend a jackboot training camp for kids with \"behavioural issues\". Only, he never gets there. Keith, also being escorted to the camp, has a go at the escorts with a crow bar and goes on the run with Danny. But keith has his own interests in mind.<br>This is a thumpingly good thriller, cleverly plotted and tightly written, with a growing Kafkaesque quality as Danny realises that his identity has been stolen and there is nothing he can do about it. As perceptive on parental agendas as it is on teenagers' needs and mindsets, Beck's novel is a racy read with plenty to ponder.</p> <h2>Number 99 by Patrick Cave (Oxford University Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504231\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/04/24/number99.jpg\" alt=\"Number 99\" width=\"128\" height=\"204\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  When the camp where 13-year-old traveller Kez lives is raided by police, she thinks it is just another example of prejudiced attitudes towards people with an alternative lifestyle. But with her mother mysteriously missing and the authorities behaving very strangely, it soon becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on. Placed as the 99th foster child of a kindly woman in Camberwell, Kez hooks up with foster child number one (now a flash success in the civil service), and a local boy who is an outcast of a different kind, to get to the bottom of things. Cave's very readable novel doesn't quite hang together as seamlessly as a good thriller should, but the theme is developed without moralising or sentimentality as the novel perceptively considers different ways of life and the choices we make about how we want to live. <h2>Spindle's End by Robin McKinley (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>When young Katriona pulls the lot that wins her a chance to go to the big city for the little princess's christening day, it changes her life. Suddenly, she finds herself responsible for a tiny little baby whose life is under threat. There are times when ordinariness is the very best disguise something - or someone - can have, and life in Katriona's village doesn't come more ordinary. Ordinary, that is, for a country where magic is \"so thick and tenacious that it settled over the land like chalk dust\". I would recommend very few of the novels written for teenagers that pass through my hands to a discerning adult reader. So this is a bit of a find. An extraordinarily imaginative retelling of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, McKinley's book is genuinely enchanting but emotionally tough.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Break Point by Rosie Rushton (Piccadilly Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504232\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/03/27/breakpoint.jpg\" alt=\"Break Point\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Sixteen-year-old Emily is fantastic at tennis and could have a glittering career ahead of her, particularly now that she's won a scholarship to a famous tennis academy. Emily's mum, a single parent, who has scrimped and saved to help Emily on her way, is over the moon. There is just one problem: Emily has had quite enough of tennis. She wants a social life and a chance to stay on at school and do A-levels, go to university and maybe work with an aid agency in Africa. It shows how three successive generations of women - daughter, mother and grandmother- are confined or liberated not just by circumstance and the era into which they were born, but also by the personal choices they make. The teenager who reads this could end up looking at her mother differently. <h2>Changing Emma by John Brindley (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the day Emma gets her GCSE results, her parents win \u00a323m on the lottery. Only her gran remembers to tell her how well she has done. But who cares about school and GCSEs when you are rich beyond your wildest dreams? Soon, old friends are forgotten as Emma is living it up, attracting the attention of the local dreamboat and feeling like a million dollars. This is an old-fashioned morality tale dressed up in a racy, contemporary format and one that is memorable for the way it gets right under its anti-heroine's skin to portray the pain of knowing that you are behaving really badly but unable to stop. Even if they haven't won \u00a323m, most teenagers have been to some of the dark emotional places Emma visits here.</p> <p> <br></p> <h2>Wicca: Book of Shadows by Cate Tiernan (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/02/14/wicca.jpg\" alt=\"Wicca: Shadows\" width=\"128\" height=\"191\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Do you have a teenage daughter who loves Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek? Perhaps she is a rather reluctant reader, but don't despair - help is at hand with this new series that crosses high school angst and romance with witchcraft. Sixteen-year-old Morgan is the shy one in a crowd led by her stunning best friend Bree. But when Cal, an attractive new boy, arrives in town and invites them all to join a coven, Morgan finds herself the centre of attention. The discovery that she is a blood witch brings tensions to the surface and romance to a head. Despite the witchcraft, it does deal realistically and sensitively with teenage worries. A new book will be published each month between now and August. <p> <br></p> <h2>Thursday's Child by Sonia Hartnett (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>It is the worst years of the Great Depression, and Harper Flute and her family are struggling to survive in a shanty shack on a dusty, unforgiving piece of land. On the day the new baby arrives, Harper takes little brother Tin fishing. Buried in a mud slide, Tin miraculously survives but can't stop tunnelling. Soon he is living permanently underneath the shack burrowing away, with consequences that are both tragic and liberating. In its evocation of the adult world seen through the eyes of a child, this book has the feel of an American classic, such as To Kill a Mockingbird - although its author is Australian. Certainly, few British novelists for young people deliver with such density or so uncompromisingly. Hartnett writes without self-censorship or artificial boundaries between adult and children ' s literature. The result is a deep, and deeply moving, novel.</p>",
  "<p><strong>SPECIFICITY FOR YOU</strong></p> <p>It's the four-headed bureaucratic monster that wants to ban prawn cocktail crisps, stop the sale of bendy bananas and (for all we know) eat our children alive. And now - if you believe Sepp Blatter, Gordon Taylor and Tony Blair - the European Union have got their Brussels snouts set on destroying the beautiful game. Run, footballers run, because your livelihoods are at stake! Well that's what the papers have been telling us. And like the fools we are, the Fiver believed them. Until today anyway, when we just happened to bump into EU culture commissioner Viviane Reding. </p> <p>\"Contrary to what has been alleged in some press articles the Commission has no intention of abolishing the transfer system altogether,\" said Red Viv as she stuck pins into her over-priced Luis Figo doll. \"We just want to see a transfer system that respects both the principles of Community law and the specificity (translation anybody?) of sport.\" Eh? said the Fiver. And so Viv guided us through footballexploitation101, explaining that \"the current system has not prevented the over-commercialisation of sport, the widening of the gap between the economically powerful and less powerful clubs and the fact that players - and especially young players - become objects of speculation\". </p> <p>\"Right on comrade!\" we chimed as Viv expanded further (like a policy balloon). The commission will agree to \"accept transfers in specified periods only\" just like Fifa want, she claimed. And \"compensation reflecting costs incurred by a club for training young people\" should be included in the new law too. To prove her goodwill, Viv even said that, though the EU had waited for ages for Fifa to provide alternatives to the present system, they would still extend the deadline of September 20. All of which makes us want to join the Euro love boat, get on down with the member nations and give them some serious loving - which, after all, is what the EU is all about.

The shock news from this part of the world - besides the temperature, which is as warm as a woolly wombat - is that this very tendon is to be operated on later this week leaving the hunky young Australian out of action for at least three months, and maybe until the new year. Hang on a minute, I'd better hide, there's a team of spies trying to hunt me down in a tiny submarine.</p> <p>That's better (I've hidden between the toes). Anyway, while Harry's tendon has not snapped, it has been painful since the end of last season and the operation will look to tidy up the sheath of the tendon (take it from me, it looks like a squat). A long period of rehabilitation will follow, and so Harry will definitely miss Leeds' matches in the first group stage of Big Cup.

  "Ian Blair must be wishing the boss would come back from holiday. The deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police has had a miserable time since Sir John Stevens went on annual leave, with Scotland Yard hogging the late summer headlines for all the wrong reasons. <p>First, the Notting Hill carnival story has run on. Next, it seems clear that the mess the Met got itself into over Gurpal Virdi, the Sikh sergeant cleared by an employment tribunal of sending racist hate-mail to colleagues, is going to cost the force a record sum, possibly more than \u00a31m. </p> <p>Two different cases, two very different stories, but there is a common theme. Some officers fear conservative forces within the Met are beginning to hold sway. There are many senior officers who think the discomfort Mr Blair is feeling is a small price to pay. They talk triumphantly of \"a line being drawn in the sand\" and insist too much has already conceded to the forces of political correctness. </p> <p>This kind of tub-thumping is to be expected from the Met Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, but the murmurings apparently go much higher up the chain of command. The federation often says what Met commanders only dare to think, and there was considerable support for Glen Smyth, its chairman, when he launched into his carnival tirade last week. </p> <p>Mr Smyth, already fizzing over publicity given to a handbook which advises officers how to deal sensitively with members of minority communities, railed at the way his members were advised to adopt a \"softly-softly\" approach to crime at the carnival. </p> <p>Although Mr Smyth is not one for subliminal messages, he missed his intended target. He was not berating the Met or blaming officers for the two murders. He was attacking the culture of nervousness and restraint, a culture created, he believes, by Sir William Macpherson, whom he once described as \"an upper-class twit from a privileged background who lives in a castle and has no idea what it is like to be a police officer\". </p> <p>Last year the issue was stop-and-search. This year, it has been the carnival. Mr Smyth's message remains the same - officers are under pressure to ignore black crime. Deputy assistant commissioner Ian Johnston has dismissed this, but he pressed home the Met's concern over the carnival, urging change because it is impossible to police in its present format. </p> <p>Mr Smyth agreed. But it was not the end of the matter. He did not anticipate the way the press, led by the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, would tear into Mr Johnston rather than concentrating on the broader picture. As the story ran out of Mr Smyth's control, Ian Blair rang the federation to express his anger at the way it had developed. Officials assured him the attacks on Mr Johnston were not being encouraged or orchestrated by the federation. \"This isn't what we intended,\" Mr Blair was told. </p> <p>Though the furore over the carnival ultimately backfired on the Met, it should not disguise the fact Mr Smyth's initial foray was widely supported by senior officers. How high up the hierarchy? \"You'd be surprised,\" said one source. </p> <p>The handling of the Virdi case was a more vivid illustration of new-found Met belligerence. Mr Virdi was dismissed from the force for allegedly writing hate-mail to himself and colleagues. </p> <p>He took the case to an employment tribunal, which condemned the Met's cack-handed investigation. The tribunal ruled Mr Virdi was discriminated against because he was Asian, and said there was no evidence that he sent the letters anyway. </p> <p>Mr Blair described the decision as a \"tough one\" and said it was \"time to draw a line under this long story\". Then the Met seemed to change tack. Last Friday deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force and one of the force's few media \"stars\", refused to apologise to Mr Virdi for the way he had been treated. </p> <p>Mr Grieve looked unusually agitated as he cited ongoing legal hearings. The real reason why the Met won't say sorry is that they think they got the right man. </p> <p>So while the Met will accept the investigation was biased and that the disciplinary process is antediluvian, it is not prepared to say Mr Virdi is innocent, however damaging that may be in the long run. The pragmatists at the Yard say that resistance is futile and that Mr Virdi will win eventually because the inquiry was flawed. They have been outgunned. Rather than cutting its losses, the Met will oversee an internal appeal and another employment tribunal will rule whether Mr Virdi was sacked unfairly. </p> <p>The irritation felt at the Yard was increased by the inconsistent remarks made at the same press conference by the independent advisory group, set up last year to offer the force advice on race issues. Mike Franklin, its vice-chairman, said the panel was sure Mr Virdi was innocent. Moments later Dr Kirpal Sahota, another leading member, said the Met \"may\" have got the wrong man. She then qualified her remark, saying that it \"probably\" got the wrong man. </p> <p>Why Mr Grieve was at the press conference is another intriguing matter. He may be the liberal face of the Met, but he had nothing to do with the case. His popularity undoubtedly irks other senior officers, and there has even been talk of devolving some of his race squad's detecting responsibilities to other departments. This would be a PR disaster and shake the confidence of the minority communities he has worked so hard to rebuild. </p> <p>The Met is in the midst of a cultural revolution, but it is one that has only just started. It dare not allow the rate of change to slow, or give in to the conservative voices that say enough is enough. The families of Stephen Lawrence, Michael Menson and others have paid a heavy price for the force's failings. The Met has still not paid its dues. </p> <p>Nick Hopkins is the Guardian's crime correspondent <a href=\"mailto:nick.hopkins@theguardian.com\">nick.hopkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>Barkbelly, by Cat Weatherill (Puffin, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797910\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2005/04/27/bark2.jpg\" alt=\"Barkbelly by Cat Weatherill\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  When a childless, elderly married couple find a beautiful egg made out of ash in a field, they take it home and rest it on their mantelpiece, only to find it hatching a few days later. Barkbelly - a wooden child - is born. Much stronger than the other children his age, he kills a playmate during a pretend bull-fighting session. Barkbelly has to run away. <h2>Little Darlings by Sam Llewellyn (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Primrose, Cassian and Daisy live with their rich father and stepmother who farm them out to a series of luckless nannies. So far, so Mary Poppins, but then Nanny Pete takes over and they end up stuck between two rival gangs of burglars. We've had this in the house for months and it has become dog-eared.</p> <h2>You Have Ghost Mail by Terence Blacker, illustrated by Adam Stower (Macmillan, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797911\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/ghostmail.jpg\" alt=\"Ghostmail\" width=\"128\" height=\"191\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  The lower end of this age group are always keen to get their hands on the really scary stuff, to be read illicitly under the covers with a torch. But the trouble with so much of the horror genre is that it is really intended for the 10-plus age range and can prove a little too scary for younger readers. And parents and teachers hate the fact that much of it is shoddily written. So Macmillan's Shock Shop range is a bit of a find - a series of really thrilling stories, spookily presented and written by top-class authors. Here, Terence Blacker, whose Ms Whizz series will be familiar to many children, has come up with a cunning and creepy story about Matthew, whose new computer appears to be possessed by a dead boy called Giles. Gripping stuff. <h2>Ghostly Beasts by Joan Aiken, illustrated by Amanda Harvey (Jonathan Cape, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>\"Short stories and poems are like mushrooms. One minute a field full of plain grass the next, a circle of glossy white globes,\" suggests Joan Aiken in the introduction to this beautiful collection of stories and poems. There are ghostly animal tales in which pets save their owners from disaster, the strange and haunting tale of the woodcarver who turns his daughter into wood, and the spine-tingling story of a village where bears were once baited and where a small child has now gone missing. What is the link? These stories are a great introduction to Aiken's work. For many children, it would be a short hop to her brilliant The Wolves of Willoughby Chase. The large type is a bonus, as are Amanda Harvey's illustrations, which capture the strange otherness of the stories.<br> </p> <h2>The Story Giant by Brian Patten, illustrated by Chris Riddell (Collins, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>In a crumbling castle in the middle of a damp English moor lives the story giant. His mind and his library are full of stories from all over the world, every story that has ever been told - except one. This last story is the one he desperately needs, for without it the Story Giant will die, his castle fall and the stories will be lost for ever. So on the night that might be his last on earth, he weaves together the dreams of four very different children from four corners of the earth and transports them to his castle to tell stories in the hope that one of these children will know the final, elusive tale. This is a wonderful variation on The Arabian Nights, in which the author tells many smaller stories within one larger one. This beautiful book gathers together 50 tales from all over the world and retells them in Patten's translucent prose, with lively illustrations by Chris Riddell. Stories from the Panchatantra rub shoulders with those from Aesop, English fairytales with African and Japanese legends. We are made to think not just about the stories themselves, but where these stories come from and why we need to tell and retell them. It's a book that can be used for many age groups: older children, from around nine, can read the whole thing themselves, but younger children could just as easily pick out a story for bedtime.</p> <h2>The Thief Lord by Cornelia Funke (The Chicken House, \u00a35.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/10/23/thieflord.jpg\" alt=\"Thief Lord\" width=\"128\" height=\"198\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  When Prosper and his little brother Bo are orphaned, their horrid aunt wants to adopt the angelic younger child and exile the older one to boarding school. So the pair run away to Venice - a place their mother told them was full of wonders. So it is, but, with winter approaching, it is also full of hardships. They fall in with a teenage boy who styles himself the Thief Lord and gives the children stolen goods to sell. Butwhen the \"wicked\" aunt engages a bumbling but kindly private detective and the Thief Lord takes on a strange commission, the children's future is threatened. Funke's story is a rollicking good adventure story, with shades of Peter Pan. Warm-hearted and funny, it is almost guaranteed to be remembered for years after the last page is read. <h2>Short and Scary by Louise Cooper (Oxford, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>One of the complaints of reluctant readers is that books contain too many words. They will often begin a novel and give up the struggle because the end seems such a distant goal. Not with this brilliant series, which also includes Short and Shocking by Maggie Pearson and Short and Silly by Michael Rosen. These stories are all so brief that you can see the finish when you are at the starting line. None are more than two pages long and some take up just a few lines. But every one of these 40 stories is a fully rounded tale. If you don't fancy one story, you can move on - you don't have to make a lifetime commitment, which is how slow readers often feel. These books have no pretensions to winning the Booker prize but they will get your children reading. A great stocking-filler.</p> <h2>Coraline by Neil Gaiman (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>When Coraline moves with her mother to an old house that has been divided into flats, she discovers a corridor behind a locked door. There is something lurking there that is much nastier, more dangerous and far more compulsive than Narnia. It is Coraline's other mother, a mother who, initially, is eager to love Coraline and please her with lovely food and interesting toys, unlike Coraline's real mother, who is distracted by work and leaves her lonely daughter to her own devices.<br>But it is not long before Coraline realises that there is something strange about this woman, with her gleaming black eyes, pointy teeth and a habit of eating beetles instead of sweets. Why does she want to sew buttons in place of Coraline's eyes, and who are the ghost children that Coraline finds in the cupboard?<br>Like Alice in Wonderland filtered through Stephen King, Neil Gaiman's novel is deliciously shivery in a way I would previously have thought unsuitable for children. It goes into the subconscious feelings that children harbour for their parents, taking the reader beyond fear to show that it is possible to survive the worst things imaginable. It will give a few children nightmares, but the majority will see that it taps into the darker recesses of their minds to let in a light that is truly liberating.<br> <br></p> <h2>Krazy Kow Saves the World - Well, Almost by Jeremy Strong, illus Nick Sharratt (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/08/27/krazykow.jpg\" alt=\"Krazy kow\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  There should be no qualification in the title. Krazy Kow saves the world. Definitely. Indisputably. Although, as his young creator, would-be film director Jamie Fink, discovers to his cost, life with a bovine superheroine isn't always easy and fame not necessarily all it is cracked up to be. <br>This wonderfully silly, wonderfully clever story is more than matched by Nick Sharratt's line drawings, which make Krazy Kow seem like the epitome of sanity. And when it comes to saving the world, or at least the world of reading, Jeremy Strong seems to be doing a superhuman job himself. <br>This book had to be wrested away from an eight-year-old who is normally a reluctant reader, and an 11-year-old who never has her nose out of a novel. Both thought it a scream. <br> <br> <h2>Buster Bayliss: Night of the Living Veg by Philip Reeve (Scholastic, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Last year, Philip Reeve made one of the most exciting of debuts with Mortal Engines, a book for teenagers that is certain to become a classic. Well, we know that he can do serious, but it seems that he can do funny just as brilliantly. You can never have too many novels with a strong appeal to boys, and this one is a winner. Buster's mother goes on a lollipop-lady training scheme, so Buster is sent to stay with gardening-mad fake aunt Pauline. Can Buster save fake aunt Pauline and the town from invasion by alien super-cabbages? You bet.<br>This is an enjoyable, laugh-out-loud romp that is silly and clever at the same time. It has a good chance of hooking even the most reluctant reader and, when it does, there is a follow-up called Buster Bayliss: The Big Freeze.</p> <h2>Daisy Chain War by Joan O'Neill (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797914\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/07/10/daisychainwar.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Chain War\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Joan O'Neill's trilogy (Hodder will be publishing parts two and three later this year) was first published in Ireland 12 years ago where it was an instant bestseller. It should be here too, judging by the enthusiasm with which my 11-year-old daughter and her friends gobbled down the first book. <br>Set in Dun Laoghaire during the second world war, it follows the fortunes of the Doyle family as seen through the sharp eyes of 10-year-old Lizzie. Her elder sister Karen marries airman Paul but happiness is short-lived when he goes missing in action. <br>This is a wonderful book about growing up and beginning to piece together and make sense of the adult world. It is beautifully written in prose that is as warm as a sunset on a hot summer's day. <h2>Journey to the River Sea by Eva Ibbotson (Macmillan, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Hurrah, it's out in paperback. If ever there was a book that deserves a place on your children's bookshelf it is this fantastical, wise and wonderful adventure story set in the Brazilian jungle. Maia is 13 and has been orphaned for two years when her only relatives are finally located - living thousands of miles up the Amazon river. Maia is sent to live with them and, in true literary tradition, they turn out to be very horrid. But Maia makes friends with Finn, a mysterious English boy who is living with the Indians.<br>This book is a window on the world. It revels in a sense of adventure not only in the story of Maia but also in the way it is told, veering between humour and sadness. I read it in one sitting, and even if the house had caught fire you would have had difficulty shifting me.</p> <h2>Child X by Lee Weatherly (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797915\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/05/29/childx.jpg\" alt=\"child x\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Jules is an ordinary 13-year-old, worried about friendships, just getting interested in boys and thrilled to have been given the role of Lyra in a local amateur production of Northern Lights. <br>The only shadow on the horizon is her mum and dad, who are increasing at odds about the former's long working hours. Then Jules's dad suddenly disappears from the family home and the place is besieged by tabloid photographers. Jules's dad has discovered that Jules is not his biological daughter. <br>A story that features Jules's dad suing her mother, secret DNA tests, and hordes of hacks on the scent of a good story, just couldn't be more topical. It tackles a difficult subject with sense and sensitivity. <br> <br> <h2>The Worry Website by Jacqueline Wilson (Doubleday, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797916\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/05/29/worrywebsite.jpg\" alt=\"worry website\" width=\"128\" height=\"183\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  The bestselling Wilson has quite a remarkable nose for what children think and feel, and the issues that concern them. She also has an accessible literary style that children love. In this series of linked short stories the two are married in perfect union. <br>The idea is deliciously simple. Mr Speed, an inspired primary teacher, has set up a worry website where his pupils can anonymously write down things that are bothering them and get advice from fellow pupils. And does the class have worries... loads of them. Holly thinks her dad is going to remarry, William thinks he is useless at everything, and Samantha misses her dad who has left home. The collection includes 12-year-old Lauren Roberts's Guardian-competition winning story. Hers is as much a delight as Wilson's. <h2>Molly Moon's Incredible book of Hypnotism by Georgia Byng (Macmillan, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Smarter than Little Orphan Annie and possessing the newly-discovered ability to hypnotise all she meets, Molly Moon, with her cute little dog, couldn't be anything other than the heroine in a (British) children's story. Georgia Byng's debut novel takes Molly from downtrodden misery in an English orphanage to fame and fortune in New York - and into the clutches of a particularly smelly villain. All ends happily. The literary stereotyping means that it could be accused of being \"writing by numbers\". But the twists and turns of the plot and the appealing exuberance of the heroine carry the day. Like much children's writing at the moment, reality doesn't get a look-in, but nine- and 10-year-olds will be drawn to Molly and her unusual talent. Prepare yourself for a summer of swinging pendulums.</p> <h2>Time Stops for No Mouse by Michael Hoeye (Puffin, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Watch out, Stuart Little, you have a literary rival. Hermux Tantamoq is an American watchmaker, city dweller and a singular mouse. So singular that Penguin have paid a record sum to secure the rights to the little creature's adventures, which begin when he meets the dashing Lika Perflinger - adventuress, daredevil and aviatrix. Hermux proves to be the most reluctant but persistent of heroes and an old-fashioned gentleman who is never going to get the girl even though he deserves to. This pleasurably anthropomorphic story has bags of charm, a zesty plot, and the feel of a book that was written for the author's pleasure rather than with a specific eye to the children's market. It is a rare novel that doesn't talk down or up, but is just right.</p> <h2>Mighty Fizz Chilla by Philip Radley (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797917\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/03/27/mightyfizzchilla.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty Fizz Chilla\" width=\"128\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  The weird thing about Philip Ridley's novels is that however weird they are - and they are gloriously skewed - they are also grounded in a down-to-earth reality. Take this one: a real leviathan of a book that includes a castle on the edge of a crumbling cliff, a blind woman decked out like a Christmas tree, a sea captain on a mythic quest, and a monster that must be fed on milky tea and custard creams. You would think that it would have to be a fantasy; in fact, it is a brilliant dissection of male teenage anger, the crisis in masculinity and why boys need dads as well as their mums. If it is wrapped up as an inviting fairy tale, written in prose so playful and graphic that you feel you can actually see the words you are reading, then all the better. This is a book that takes a little effort over the first few pages, but Ridley has never given a more convincing performance in his quest to demonstrate that stories show us how to live. <h2>The Ghost Behind the Wall by Melvin Burgess (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Thrillers that are not very thrilling and ghost stories that hardly cause a tingle are too often the norm in writing for children and young people. Melvin Burgess breaks the mould with this story about a man who haunts himself. Reading it is like having a fingernail drawn very slowly down your back. David is a lonely 12-year-old, abandoned by his mother and living with his uncommunicative father. At school, he is bullied because he is small for his age. But his size allows him to gain access to the disused ventilation system in his block of flats. Soon he is playing nasty tricks on the other residents, but when he is forced to team up with the ghost of a boy who haunts the pipes and starts terrorising elderly Mr Alveston, who is in the early stages of dementia things get out of control.<br> </p> <h2>Mirrors by Wendy Cooling (Collins, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Like poetry, short stories tend to fall out of fashion with older children and they are often rather dully produced. But this collection is a real cracker for the 10-plus age range. And a good bridge into a world of more grown-up books. The list of authors is first-rate and so is the writing; one of the bonuses of the collection is the way it covers such a wide range of genres. My 10-year-old, for example, would never read a horror book, but was much taken with Jeremy Strong's vampire parrot story and Lesley Howarth's creepy Mirrors.com. She would think herself too old for fairy tales, but loved Berlie Doherty's The Girl of Silver Lake. There is good stuff, too, from classy writers such as Anne Fine, Melvin Burgess and Malorie Blackman.<br> </p> <h2>Up On Cloud Nine by Anne Fine (Doubleday, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797918\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/02/14/cloudnine.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud Nine\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  Stolly is a one-off. Even his teachers call him eccentric when they aren't calling him a liar and fantasist. Bright, funny and emotionally upfront (none of the other boys rag him when Stolly talks about how he feels), and with parents so irresponsible they behave like kids, Stolly was always so alive. But now he is lying motionless in a hospital bed after a fall - which doesn't look like an accident - from a top-floor window. Beside him sits his best friend Ian, who tells us all about Stolly, a star who shone so brightly he burned himself out. This latest novel from the Children ' s Laureate may be inspired by the phenomenon of teenage suicide, but there is nothing grim or mawkish about it: a wonderfully funny and perceptive glimpse of the inner lives of boys.",
  "<p>Two independent TV producers have joined forces to launch a tax-based funding venture with \u00a350m to invest in factual and fictional TV and film production.</p> <p>Clive Syddall, chairman of Paladin Pictures, and Bill Cran, founder of InVision Productions, have linked up to form Apollo TV &amp; Film Partnerships. The scheme will be administered by a leading firm of accountants and is backed by a major UK bank. </p> <p>Apollo, which takes advantage of tax deferment legislation introduced in 1997 byChancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, can invest up to \u00a315m in qualifying British TV or film productions. The scheme can cashflow projects from the first day of production and enhance budgets by 6-10%. </p> <p>Cran said: \"What's unique about our scheme is that the money is available to producers upfront and on favourable terms.\"</p> <p>To receive Apollo financing, which will be a mixture of investment from the scheme's backers and bank loans, producers will have to have a licence from a broadcaster and, or a commitment from a distributor or sales agent.</p> <p>Syddall and Cran are talking to producers who are seeking funding and can invest up to \u00a350m before the end of the current tax year. Cran said they were looking for \"people with established track records\". </p> <p>He added that, in addition to TV drama and feature films, Apollo was interested in factual projects, including history, science, wildlife and music programming. But the minimum budget would need to be \"approaching \u00a31m\" and they would have to be at least three to five episodes in length. </p> <p>Syddall said: \"I think what's happening in the market is that UK licence fees are being reduced by broadcasters.

It will be Atlantis' 22nd mission and the 99th flight in Shuttle program history.</p> <p> Veteran Astronaut Terry Wilcutt (Col., USMC) leads the seven-man crew, commanding his second Shuttle flight and making his fourth trip into space. During the planned 11-day mission, Wilcutt and his crew mates will spend a week inside the ISS unloading supplies from both a double Spacehab cargo module in the rear of Atlantis' cargo bay and from a Russian Progress M-1 resupply craft docked to the aft end of the Zvezda Service Module. Zvezda, which linked up to the ISS on July 26, will serve as the early living quarters for the station and is the cornerstone of the Russian contribution to the ISS.</p> <p> The goal of the flight is to prepare Zvezda for the arrival of the first resident, or Expedition, crew later this fall and the start of a permanent human presence on the new outpost. That crew, Expedition Commander Bill Shepherd, Soyuz Commander Yuri Gidzenko and Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev, is due to launch in a Soyuz capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in late October for a four-month \"shakedown\" mission aboard the ISS.</p> <p> In addition, Dr. Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko (Col., Russian Air Force), both making their second flights into space, will conduct a 6\u00bd-hour space walk on the fourth day of the flight to hook up electrical, communications and telemetry cables between Zvezda and the Zarya Control Module, whose computers handed over commanding functions to the Service Module's computers in a smooth transition in late July. Lu and Malenchenko will also install a magnetometer to the exterior of Zvezda. The magnetometer will serve as a three-dimensional compass designed to minimise Zvezda propellant usage by relaying information to the module's computers regarding its orientation relative to the Earth.</p> <p> It will be the second joint U.S.-Russian space walk outside a Space Shuttle, following on the work conducted by Astronaut Scott Parazynski and Cosmonaut Vladimir Titov outside Atlantis while docked to the Mir Space Station during the STS-86 mission in October 1997. Lu, designated EV 1, will wear the space suit marked by red stripes, while Malenchenko, EV 2, will wear the pure white suit. This will be Lu's first space walk, while Malenchenko conducted a pair of space walks totalling 12 hours during his four-month stay aboard Mir in 1994. Dan Burbank (Lt. Cmdr, USCG), who is a space rookie, will serve as the space walk choreographer.</p> <p> Mission Specialist Rick Mastracchio, also a space novice, will be the prime robot arm operator for the mission, using the Canadian-built arm to move Lu and Malenchenko around the ISS as they conduct their assembly work. Mastracchio is backed up on arm operations by Pilot Scott Altman (Cmdr., USN), making his second flight into space.</p> <p> The final member of the crew is Russian Cosmonaut Dr. Boris Morukov, making his first flight into space. Morukov will be responsible for unloading supplies from the Progress vehicle during the docked phase of the flight. </p> <p> When Wilcutt guides Atlantis in for its docking with the ISS on the third day of the mission, he will find the new station a much larger facility than the one left by the STS-101 crew during its flight in May. With the addition of the Zvezda and the Progress resupply ship, the ISS will measure 143 feet in length, roughly the height of a 13-story building, and will weigh 67 tons, twice the size of the ISS back in May. The joining of Zvezda to the ISS and the arrival of the Progress provides about 8,800 cubic feet of habitable volume for Station crew members, roughly the size of a comfortable apartment. By the time the U.S. Laboratory Destiny is installed on the ISS in January, the Station will have surpassed both Skylab and Mir in total liveable space.</p> <p> On the fifth day of the flight, Atlantis' crew will enter the ISS, opening the hatch for the first time to Zvezda and to the Progress to begin unloading 1,300 pounds of goods from the Russian craft for the first resident crew, including items ranging from clothing to medical kits, personal hygiene kits, laptop computers, a colour printer, vacuum cleaners, food warmers for Zvezda's galley, trash bags and critical life support hardware, including an Elektron oxygen generation unit and a Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit. Elektron and Vozdukh will be unstowed from the Progress and moved into Zvezda, but will not be installed and activated until the Expedition One crew arrives on board. The first toilet for the ISS will be delivered to Zvezda on the last day of the crew's work inside the Station for installation this fall once the Expedition 1 crew is on board.</p> <p> Among the first tasks facing Atlantis' crew will be the installation of three batteries and associated electronic components in Zvezda and replacement of two of the six batteries in the Zarya module, completing the work begun by the STS-101 crew in May. Zvezda was launched from Baikonur on July 12 with five of its eight battery sets already installed. Lu and Malenchenko will be in charge of the installation work in Zvezda. Also earmarked for Zvezda is the activation of two gas masks which will serve as standard emergency equipment for ISS crews and three fire extinguishers. In addition, American-Russian power conversion units will be installed in Zvezda on this flight to route electricity from huge solar arrays which will be installed on the STS-97 mission to the Russian modules. Electrical components to charge the batteries of Soyuz or Progress vehicles visiting the ISS will be installed in Zvezda as well.</p> <p> While Morukov spends most of his time unloading supplies from the Progress, Mastracchio will be in charge of unloading 2 tons of equipment from the Spacehab module, including medical equipment for the ISS' Crew Health Care System, or CheCS, which will serve as the heart of the station's clinic for orbiting crews, and a treadmill device and bicycle ergometer which will serve as the first exercise gear for crews on board the ISS. Associated hardware for the treadmill which will prevent its use from disturbing sensitive microgravity experiments, will be installed by the crew members near the end of their stay on board.</p> <p> On the tenth day of the flight, Atlantis will undock from the ISS and Altman will conduct a flyaround of the newly expanded station to enable his crew mates to conduct photo documentation of the outpost. </p> <p> Two days later, Wilcutt will fly Atlantis to a predawn landing at the Kennedy Space Center, setting the stage a few days later for the launch of a second Russian Progress ship to the Station and a plethora of Shuttle assembly flights to turn the complex into a working research facility.</p>",
  "British Gypsies will accuse the home secretary of racism in the high court this morning when they seek a judicial review of his decision to sign an order banning their annual horse fair in the Kent village of Horsmonden. <p>The Gypsy Council, the National Romany Rights Association and Liberty, the civil liberties group, will claim today that a ban on the fair, one of the most important events in the Gypsy calendar, is unreasonable and possibly discriminatory, saying there is no good reason why the historic event should be cancelled. </p> <p>Lawyers will claim that the home secretary, Jack Straw, has not taken into account all the issues involved in the case. They will also point out that the order infringes the right to freedom of assembly, which is set to be enshrined in the European convention on human rights next month. </p> <p>The Gypsy Council will challenge the order made under section 14a of the 1986 public order act, and will cite remarks made by Mr Straw about travellers in an interview with BBC Radio West Midlands last year, in which he said: \"Many of these so-called travellers seem to think that it is perfectly OK for them to cause mayhem in an area, to go burgling, thieving, breaking into vehicles, causing all kinds of trouble, including defecating in the doorways of firms and so on, and getting away with it. </p> <p>\"Travellers have traded on the sentiment, they have masqueraded as law-abiding Gypsies, when many of them are not.\" </p> <p>The home secretary gave his consent to allow Tonbridge Wells borough council to stop \"trespassory assembly\" on the village green over the coming weekend after the Horsmonden parish council had decided to stop the fair because it had \"grown too big\". </p> <p>Gypsies claim that the decision to ban the fair, which they say is more than 400 years old, is racial in nature and deprives them of their culture and heritage. </p> <p>On the second Sunday in September, the village green in Horsmonden becomes the site for horse trading and the selling of traditional Gypsy finery, such as china, linen and lace. The fair was used to celebrate the end of the hop-picking season, and a means of catching up with family and friends. </p> <p>The green has been closed for the weekend but Gypsies plan to have a parade through the village and hundreds are expected to turn up to protest against the decision. </p> <p>Grattan Puxon, spokesman for the Gypsy Council, said: \"Horsmonden was mentioned as early as the 12th century by horse traders and horse breeders.\" </p> <p>Neil Robins, chairman of Horsmonden parish council, disputes the heritage and age of the horse fair, saying: \"Historically there has always been a bone of contention between ourselves and the Romanies as to how far it goes back\". </p> <p>Mr Robins says the festival was for hop-pickers who came to the area from east London. He claims there was only a very small element of horse trading but that it has grown with the attraction of Romanies to the fair. </p> <p>\"It has become like a glorified boot sale with lots of traders and horse boxes turning up with horses,\" he said, adding that there had been problems with traffic and horses being raced up one-way streets the wrong way. In April, the parish council decided by a majority to ban the event. </p> <p>Eddie Hersey and his wife Susanna, who are Gypsies and have lived in Horsmonden for 23 years, believe that a tradition has been taken away from them. They have attended the event every year and plan a family party at the weekend.</p>",
  "<p>Two independent TV producers have joined forces to launch a tax-based funding venture with \u00a350m to invest in factual and fictional TV and film production.</p> <p>Clive Syddall, chairman of Paladin Pictures, and Bill Cran, founder of InVision Productions, have linked up to form Apollo TV &amp; Film Partnerships. The scheme will be administered by a leading firm of accountants and is backed by a major UK bank. </p> <p>Apollo, which takes advantage of tax deferment legislation introduced in 1997 by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, can invest up to \u00a315m in qualifying British TV or film productions. </p> <p>The scheme can cashflow projects from the first day of production and enhance budgets by 6-10%. </p> <p>Cran said: \"What's unique about our scheme is that the money is available to producers upfront and on favourable terms.\"</p> <p>To receive Apollo financing, which will be a mixture of investment from the scheme's backers and bank loans, producers will have to have a licence from a broadcaster and, or a commitment from a distributor or sales agent.</p> <p>Syddall and Cran are talking to producers who are seeking funding and can invest up to \u00a350m before the end of the current tax year. Cran said they were looking for \"people with established track records\". </p> <p>He added that, in addition to TV drama and feature films, Apollo was interested in factual projects, including history, science, wildlife and music programming. But the minimum budget would need to be \"approaching \u00a31m\" and they would have to be at least three to five episodes in length. </p> <p>Syddall said: \"I think what's happening in the market is that UK licence fees are being reduced by broadcasters. The amount producers can get from distributors doesn't fill that gap. That's where we come in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last night Arsenal maintained their spell over Chelsea, coming back from two goals down to gain a point at Stamford Bridge. Meanwhile, at Pride Park, Derby were staging their third escape in four matches, scoring three times late on to nick a draw against Middlesbrough. Following on from the nerve-jangling match between Spain and Yugoslavia in Euro 2000 it looks like being the year of the comeback. But lest we forget, here's a few other table-turners that grabbed the headlines.</p> <p><strong>No 1: 5th February 2000 - Derby 3 Sheff Wednesday 3</strong></p> <p>Wednesday, stranded like the Kursk at the bottom of the Premiership, stormed into a 2-0 lead. And although Branko Strupar managed to reduce the deficit, with a minute left Simon Donnelly broke away to make it 3-1 to Wednesday. Game over, Pride Park thought, and the Derby fans started leaving in their droves. Then the incredible happened.</p> <p>First Craig Burley pulled one back on the stroke of full time. And then - with 101 seconds of added time played - Georgi Kinkladze played the ball in to Malcolm Christie, and his shot bounced off Pavel Srnicek and Andy Hinchcliffe before trickling in. Afterwards Danny Wilson, the ever optimistic Wednesday manager insisted it was a point gained rather than two lost. \"For 98 per cent of the game we were absolutely superb,\" he claimed. \"Who knows? At the end of the season this point might prove to be a good one,\" he added. It wasn't.</p> <p><strong>No 2: 23rd October 1999 - Chelsea 2 Arsenal 3</strong></p> <p>Chelsea were 2-0 up with just 15 minutes to go. Ed de Goey hadn't conceded a goal in the league at Stamford Bridge for nearly six months, and there was little sign that he was about to change his habits. At this point most Premiership sides would have curled up and accepted the inevitable. But most Premiership sides don't have Kanu in their squad.</p> <p>After 75 minutes the Nigerian international's long toe stabbed in a shot from Marc Overmars to pull it back to 2-1, and Chelsea's defence - so strong for so long - suddenly crumbled like an over-dry fruit cake. Eight minutes later, Kanu picked up a pass from Overmars, controlled it and then whipped the ball past De Goey. Arsenal were level, but they weren't finished. As the game entered injury time, de Goey lost leave of his senses, and charged out of his goal to challenge Kanu near the corner flag. In one elegant movement, Kanu rode his tackle and whipped the ball in from an impossible angle, over the despairing heads of Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. The comeback was complete.</p> <p><strong>No 3: May 30, 1999 - Second Division playoff final, Gillingham 2 Manchester City 2</strong> </p> <p>In 1999, Manchester City were not renowned for their powers of escapology. Relegation from the First Division the previous season, only two seasons after losing their Premiership status, had made the Blue half of Manchester a laughing stock. So it was par for the course when Gillingham opened up a two goal lead in the last ten minutes of the playoff final at Wembley. Goals from Carl Asaba and future City striker Robert Taylor in the 81st and 86th minute looked to have knocked the stuffing out of Joe Royle's side. </p> <p>But then, with 15 seconds of normal time left, Kevin Horlock drove in a low shot from the edge of the box, and City heads picked up. Four minutes into injury time and they nearly exploded, when Paul Dickov took a touch to control a flick from Shaun Goater and then fired the ball past Gills keeper Vince Bartram. With no further goals in extra-time, City won out 3-1 on penalties, and their fans came up with several innovative things for United to do with their treble.</p> <p><strong>No 4: 9th September 1998 - West Ham 3 Wimbledon 4</strong> </p> <p>On a balmy, barmy early September night, West Ham calypsoed their way to a 3-0 lead within the opening 27 minutes. Ian Wright was on fire, scoring two goals, and the game looked like becoming a rout. But the Crazy Gang started to fight back (well this was in the pre-Egil Olsen era), with Marcus Gayle's looping header and then Jason Euell's drive pulling it back to 3-2. </p> <p>For a while it seemed that West Ham had steadied the ship, but 13 minutes from time Shaka Hislop and Andy Impey collided as they tried to clear a corner from Michael Hughes and the ball fell for Gayle who dabbed it home. By now the Dons smelt blood and they completed the most unlikely of results four minutes from the end when Euell's cross found substitute Efan Ekoku on the far post and he headed home.</p> <p><strong>No 5: 19th January 1997 - Port Vale 4 QPR 4</strong> </p> <p>Rangers were 4-0 down at half-time, and it should have been even worse. So the players must have expected their usually gruff manager, Stewart Houston, to hurl a few cups of tea - along with a few choice words - during the break. Instead he took the softly, softly approach. \"I said to my players at half-time, if they can score four goals in the first half then why can't you score four in the second?\" Houston admitted after the game. And his players duly obliged.</p> <p>They pulled one back through a bizarre own goal after 65 minutes, and then in a freakish last five minutes scored three times - through Andy Impey, Paul Murray and then John Spencer - to snatch the most unlikely of draws. Afterwards Vale manager Rudge said: \"I've never seen anything like that in my life. After a vintage display you come off feeling sick. It's unbelievable. We let it slip through our fingers like water through a colander.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> The cost of free access</strong></p> <p>Our postbag has been liberally seasoned with laments about ntl - mostly about April's free internet offer which, as far as many eager subscribers are concerned, is a chimera. </p> <p>Leigh Donnison of Leighton Buzzard signed up to ntl's phone and cable TV package specifically because of the free deal. Unlike many readers she was given the necessary disc, but instead of getting free connection and phone calls to the server as promised, she found she was being charged. </p> <p>No one could tell her when she would receive a replacement disc entitling her to free access. Furious, she decided to return to BT but discovered firstly that she was bound by a 12-month contract, and secondly that the ntl technician had removed her BT cable, even though the ntl line ran through a different part of the house. Replacement would cost up to \u00a3100. Eventually ntl agreed to release her and collect their equipment. Donnison waited in all day, but no one appeared. Nor has her letter of complaint been acknowledged. </p> <p>\u0095 ntl says it has now contacted Donnison to apologise and offer compensation. Massive demand, it says, is the cause of such frustrations. \"If everyone who registered for ntlworld was connected straight away the service level would have been unacceptably poor,\" says a spokeswoman (why, one wonders, weren't they prepared for this?). \"We made the decision to phase distribution of discs, but this did result in a much longer wait than originally indicated.\" Everyone who registered in April and May should be connected by the end of August, she says.</p> <p><strong> Held in suspense</strong></p> <p>Mike Power also joined up with ntl in April, the idea being that calls to his old BT lines would be diverted via an ntl adaptor. He received a welcome message and was told he was now registered, but since then he has been unable to make an internet connection. \"Despite numerous messages on my other ISP, all I get is an automated reply saying an engineer will contact me and none has,\" he says. \"The technical support line costs \u00a31 per minute which I think is scandalous.\" </p> <p>\u0095 If it takes two months and 10 days for Consumer to coax a reply, pity the ordinary customers. After four calls to customer services, Power was sent a new adaptor, after which, according to a spokeswoman, ntl supposed that all was well. \"We've now called to give further assistance and with the intention of offering compensation for the poor service, but the Powers have returned to BT. A bit of an unfortunate story really...\" Quite so, but surely compensation isn't limited to victims who don't escape. </p> <p><strong> Delayed reaction</strong></p> <p>Stephanie Marriott of Glasgow is also a frustrated would-be customer. Two years ago CableTel (now ntl) asked whether she and her neighbours had any objection to their tenement being cabled up. Asked if they would make good any damage, the engineers went off to check and never returned. From frequent calls over the ensuing months Marriott learned that the block couldn't be cabled but no one could tell her why. \"I've now phoned twice a week over the last month to say that we all want cable,\" says Marriott. \"They invariably say they'll call back but never do. Meanwhile we keep getting fliers about the benefits of switching to ntl.\" </p> <p>\u0095 ntl has now sent a technician round to explain that the block can only be cabled with the consent of all residents and that the area is being reassessed. A pity it took two years to let them know.</p> <p>\u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com</p>",
  "<p>The Amazon bandwagon rolled into Paris last week for the glittering launch of the giant net retailer's latest branch, <a href=\"http://www.Amazon.fr\" target=\"_new\">www.Amazon.fr</a>. Before a lavish party on the Seine, chief executive Jeff Bezos declared ambitions for the French site familiar to Amazon-watchers around the world: to become number one in the country for online sales of books, CDs, videos and DVDs. </p> <p>But Amazon might not find France as easy to wow as the UK or Germany, its other European beachheads. </p> <p>As well as fierce competition from three local incumbants, the American retailer will also be unable to use a key weapon in its armoury - price cutting. </p> <p>Amazon started working on its French website in secret 18 months ago. The company failed in an effort to buy an existing online bookshop, so had to build everything from scratch. \"We chose France as our third European plant,\" says Amazon.fr managing director Georges Aoun, \"because electronic sales are really taking off, with the largest growth in Europe.\" </p> <p>But other companies have bet on the same idea. \"Book sales in France are valued at 14 billion francs (\u00a31.4bn), out of which only 0.5 per cent are sold on the Internet,\" explains Sophie Rasle of a rival, <a href=\"http://www.bol.fr\" target=\"_new\">bol.fr</a>. </p> <p>\"In comparison, in the United States, 5.4 % of books are sold on the Internet. We hope the arrival of Amazon will boost the market.\" </p> <p>Indeed, all Amazon's competitors in France remain positive, counting on enlargement of the market. The leader in online book sales is fnac.com , whose bookshops also dominate the \"bricks and mortar\" market for books and CDs, with a 15 billion-franc (\u00a31.5bn) turnover. </p> <p>\"We are rather surprised that Amazon did not come earlier,\" says Jean-Christophe Hermann, fnac.com chairman. \"Isn't it risky arriving so late?\" </p> <p>In second position comes Alapage.com, a website bought by France Telecom in October 1999. Its creator, Patrice Magnard, is confident too. </p> <p>\"We have been established since 1988 when we started online sales of books with the Minitel system. We launched our website in March 1996.\" </p> <p>Far behind Fnac and Alapage comes a CD discounter, Amazon.com and bol.fr, launched in February 1999 as a joint-venture between German publishers Bertelsmann and French counterpart Havas. </p> <p>With its French website, Amazon is taking aim at a worldwide market of 160-million French speakers. But the e-tailer, which has lost 70% of its market value this year, is likely to find it as difficult to turn a profit with amazon.fr as it has elsewhere. In France, most commentators think e-commerce will not be profitable for another three to five years. </p> <p>\"Our development requires lots of investment, in terms of technology as well as logistics,\" says Amazon's Georges Aoun. \"Our advantage is being able to share these investments between several countries, as for our call centre for customers in the Netherlands.\" </p> <p>But despite its multinational approach, Amazon will still have to abide by France's block on book discounting. </p> <p>The bar exists because, in France, books are considered \"privileged vehicles of culture\", and have to be accessible to any citizen at the same price in any part of the country. </p> <p>But Aoun says discounting is not a vital part of the Amazon offering. \"One cannot say that Amazon won the American market because we offered 30% discounts,\" he claims. \"Prices don't determine the choice to buy online. Customers appreciate the large catalogue we offer as well as shopping at any time.\" </p> <p>\"E-commerce is not alone in using price competition in the United States and in Britain. This is linked to the structure of the market. Moreover, in Germany, where prices are regulated, Amazon.de is the market leader.\" </p> <p>That site was launched in October 1998, six months after Amazon bought up a small online bookshop, Telebuch.de. Most countries in the European Union regulate the price of books. Only Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Britain, Luxembourg and Sweden do not. </p> <p>To counter regulation, many readers go to Belgian websites, such as Proxis.be, which offer discounts on French books. But this importing of books is against French law, and the publishers' trade union is now suing the Belgian website. </p> <p>\"Belgium is worth it if you are here to pull it off quickly and then leave,\" says Aoun. \"But if you want to become rooted in a market, you have to play the game.\" </p> <p>\"The Belgian examples are not convincing,\" adds Jacques Mazel of publishers Fayard. \"Our position, as French publishers, is to refuse to supply them.\" </p> <p>For him, e-commerce in books is a real opportunity, even without discounts. \"It's important for us to be referenced by these websites because it makes it easier to sell older books that one can rarely find in a bookshop.\" </p> <p>Antoine Gallimard, chairman of the eponymous publishing house, also says that \"electronic technology must enable us to preserve the content of our books.\" </p> <p>But he warns: \"We have to invent new solutions to stop Amazon, Alapage or Fnac alone controlling the market. Once we are able to use the Internet to support our writers and discover others, we will have won our bet.\" </p> <p>Jean-Christophe Hermann, chairman of the online wing of giant French retailer Fnac, adds that France's restrictive laws could even be good news for Amazon, which has watched its stock plunge in recent months in the face of market worries about when it will become profitable. </p> <p>\"The economic model of the internet does not make goods cheaper than when they are sold in traditional shops,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Amazon cannot afford to be a discounter anymore. Because of its terrible losses, it has to become profitable.\"</p>",

Very much like that scene, I happened to walk in, I was dressed as a Viking and that scene took place. </p> <p>Q1: Did they let him out of the house?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, that's what happened, no he refused to go out. He was extremely stubborn; the same thing with Frank Sinatra not getting out of the car is also my cousin Eddie as well. It is true. I mean we're ready to go a movie and I say, \"Ed, the movies going to be on\" and he says, \"Not until Sinatra finishes his song, it's not polite\". But that is him. </p> <p><strong>Q2</strong>: What was the studio's reaction to Toys, and did they interfere?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, they didn't interfere with that film because it was so out there, there was really nothing, y'know.</p> <p>Q2: Did they understand it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, but to be honest with you, most critics didn't understand it either. I probably got criticised for that film more than for any other film I've done in my life. To the point I'm going, \"What did I do?\" It was a surrealistic kind of comedy and it was peculiar and people were living in a pop-out house and it dealt with certain kind of issues and it was an odd-ball kind of film in a way, but a better example would be Rain Man. So Rain Man, for instance, they would say, \"Listen\" and here's the way they would deal with it, \"cause they didn't like the ending but they didn't say it that way and they say, \"Listen, so if you ever feel like you wanna re-shoot some things at the end, y'know, feel free to do that\". I just tell you one quick story, we did have a screening for an audience, where they fill out the cards and they say, \"What do you think of the ending?\" I'll always remember one card that said, \"What do you think of the ending?\" and the person wrote in: \"I was hoping the little guy would snap out of it.'</p> <p><strong>Q3:</strong> The ending of The Natural had a certain tacked on feeling. Was that intentional?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes it was, because it was a fable, because of the way the movie progressed it seemed like a logical conclusion. It's an interesting thing because y'know, Bernard Malamud who wrote it had a different ending. It was a much darker ending. We talked about the difference between the book and the film. The film goes a different way than [novelist] Malamud went. On the other hand, I don't think we could have gotten away with Malamud's ending which was he strikes out and he's accused of throwing the game and it ends with \"Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so\". It's sort of something where we wouldn't get away with either. And probably it becomes one of the screenwriter going his direction which was into this kind of, I guess, sort of, full fantasy type of work that seemed consistent to that, in my mind. At one time we almost thought that we would just have him swing and it would go, \"Strike three\" and the to black, and that would be the ending. Just to see what the reaction of the studio would have been, which would probably have been to pass out. That Robert Redford strikes out at the end and it just goes to black. . . it seemed consistent to what we were doing.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Why did you part company after something like 12 years of working with Mark Johnson as your producer?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well, I think because Mark wanted to do a number of films at that point and I was doing certain things. There comes a point because we started out together, that we have different kinds of ambitions. He wanted to pursue other pieces and so at that point in time it seemed the right thing to do. He's gone on to do other things and I've obviously done other things. Although we've just worked this past year on a piece called An Everlasting Piece, which I shot in Ireland. It was a very small movie and it takes place in Belfast in the 80s. It was written by someone who grew up in Belfast and it's a comedy that deals with a couple of wig salesmen. They sell hairpieces. One's Catholic and one's Protestant and they kind of deal with one another set against the backdrop of the 80s in Belfast. So we worked on that one together, y'know, so we still obviously stay in contact.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Do you enjoy being a producer yourself? Because obviously that's something that you've become, I mean apart from your own movies with Baltimore Pictures and now Baltimore Spring Creek Pictures, you've got a kind of roster of productions which aren't necessarily yours.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well there's two different things to it. I mean, one, there are some films that are personal to me that I want to do; there are other ideas that come along and I say, \"I'd like to see that\" and if I can help to facilitate that in some fashion then I would love to do that. So y'know, Analyse This, this past year was out of our company and Perfect Storm was out of our company and Quiz Show was out of our company and some things I'm probably forgetting. Some things are just nice, you say, \"I'd like to see that happen\" and then there are those that I feel more emotionally connected to.</p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> I want to ask about An Everlasting Piece - why did you get involved with something that seems to be out of the normal course of your film-making, your milieu?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well Mark Johnson gave me the script and I thought it was interesting and he said, \"What about directing?\" I said, \"I don't know, I'm not sure that maybe it shouldn't be an Irish director who does it\" But I said, \"I'll tell you what I'll do, why don't we get some Irish actors together and have a reading of the script and I'll see if what I think is humorous and where I think things work, work. Then if I feel comfortable enough, then I'll do that.\" And we had a reading of it and I thought all the things that were humorous and where the drama was actually, I was very comfortable with and so I agreed to do it. When I went to Belfast, I was sort of surprised because it reminds me of Baltimore! It has the row houses, it's very similar in parts to Baltimore. I was sort of shocked by it, I thought I was doing sort of the Belfast version of Tin Man. It has aspects of that, of course there is the political climate, which we don't really focus on, we really deal with the relationship of these two guys trying to sell hairpieces. It's always the odd man out because if they're in a Catholic neighbourhood then the Protestant is out, or vice versa. And it was an interesting piece because you can deal with those issues without dealing with them head-on and dealing with the comedy which is not the comedy about the troubles, it is really about the relationship between these two guys in what I might consider a much more of a human comedy, and so that's how it happened.</p> <p><strong>Q6:</strong> Do you use self-destructive characters in your personal movies, to ensure the films - because they are based in your memory - don't become too sentimental and soppy?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well I don't think I consciously do any one thing, I think it just becomes, when you lay it out in your head, you go down the road that seems to make sense to you, rather than saying I think I need to do this because it will counter-balance this, etc etc. I think any time you deal with certain things that take place in the past you always struggle with, especially if you're not really action-oriented and you're character-oriented, you're always going to have to deal with the aspects of what is going to be a clich\u00e9 from what we know versus what happened. But I don't try to consciously do any one thing to counter-balance what I think, y'know, someone may think or feel. I have to kind of just rely on my own instincts.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I just wanted to ask you one supplementary question which is about the burlesque aspect of Liberty Heights. What made you make that such an important focus of the action - and also not just as a setting where people meet and talk, it's almost like a commentary as we go through the film, you cut to burlesque dancers throughout the film, what is the kind of importance of burlesque in Liberty Heights?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it's part of the transition as well because it's the end of that. A lot of the other things are all at the beginning and that's really the end of that. It was also the end of, in a sense, the ultimate irony that the numbers racket which ended was taken over by the government and that became the big lotteries that we had and a lot of those people were arrested - the government took for being \"Well that's a good idea, we'll do it instead\". I thought the setting of things that are ending and things that are beginning and also my father, a lot of his friends had been involved on the block where they had the clubs etc and they always had sort of shady kind of, y'know, things that went on. It wasn't like Mafioso stuff, but there were these questionable things. Like a mother says at one point, \"Because it's illegal, but it's not so bad\". I thought y'know, it is a true story, about the guy hitting the money, but would have busted them. In the context of it all, I thought it was the right texture for it.</p> <p><strong>Q7:</strong> Why did you set the black young girl in the school [in Liberty Heights]. I ask this because I grew up in Baltimore, and I just don't think that she is credible.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> First of all, it was real. Actually I am surprised that you would ask that question, because there were, in my year, three blacks. All of them were middle class. Because Forest Park was a middle class section, the middle class blacks went to the middle class school. Rather than the poor blacks who would still be down at Dunbar etc and that part of town. And it wasn't until bussing began to move people from one neighbourhood to another. But at that point in time, it would definitely be a middle class black individual that would be going to Forest Park.</p> <p>Q7: You have it set in '54?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes, in '54, the beginning of the desegregation of the school system. I actually took a real situation and she actually, her father was a doctor. So I just took the thing that I knew about.</p> <p><strong>Q8:</strong> How do you feel about the lack of depiction of Jewish culture in British television and film?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know enough about the situation here to really comment on it because I'm not familiar with the shows on television because we wouldn't have seen them in the States, so I really don't know enough to give you a good answer.</p> <p><strong>Q9:</strong> Why did you do Disclosure?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I thought it was interesting to me to deal with the issue of sexual harassment because it became like, the corporation's paranoia of the 80s versus what the corporation's stories in the past might have been in terms of take-overs and whatever, power plays and all that kind of stuff. What I was intrigued by was the politics of that, and I was also intrigued by whether or not you can create suspense, hold the audience together, for two hours and try to get them involved in terms of the tension of it, when in the end, no one has a gun and no one is going to shoot anybody, in the end the guy could lose his job. Just that. But yet you create a world of certain suspense and intrigue and there is no gun, there is no one coming to kill you. So I like that idea of dealing with suspense and using the sexual harassment issue to kind of play that out. So that it becomes all these glass walls, it seems so friendly and becomes a point of paranoia. That intrigued me on that respect.</p> <p><strong>Q10:</strong> Was Tom Cruise your original choice in Rain Man?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I came into the film late. Dustin and Tom had both been signed to do the movie and four directors had been involved and all of them dropped out. Finally I had a conversation with Dustin Hoffman, who talked to me about it and he was explaining the story and I said, \"Oh that's interesting, I don't see what the big problem is\". Sydney Pollack was the last director to drop out because he couldn't figure out how to handle the story. So I came late into the process and so I took over and my big thing was to throw out all the story stuff they had. Let's just simplify it. We've got two guys in a car. I'll tell you this, because every director approaches things in a different way. Sydney Pollack said to me, and for him, ultimately, it probably wasn't the right film to do. He said, \"I don't want to do a movie about two schmucks in a car\" and I said, \"Sydney, I think that it's a good idea\" and ultimately I took out the adventure aspects of it and let's just focus on these two things. The salesman who can sell and can charm, with this individual who can't be sold, who can't be charmed and who you can't really communicate with. At some point it's going to turn back on yourself and you're gonna have to deal with yourself because there is no one else to deal with. And so that's what happened. When we went on the road to shoot it, we just kept finding other things and trying other things as we went along. So a lot of it became improvisation along the road. And to not focus on the issues of autism, because it's not a disease that can be corrected, and yet at the same time, let's not be afraid of humour, because it's also a part of it. And when I spoke to families of autistic children they could tell you stories because it's part of like, almost a pressure release. Because they have to be able to talk about it with some kind of humour, otherwise it's just so difficult for them. But not to be afraid of that as a texture to the film. So long answer to that, they were already there when I came on.</p> <p><strong>Q11:</strong> What was this thing you've got with Cadillacs?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In many ways because it's the American dream and in these films it is part of that. You go to see the Cadillac and the American dream is there. But all is not well in America, and so in the course of the year of this film, going from rushes. . . that's the changeover from the '55 to the '56 model and the '54 to the '55.. the '56 comes out in '55 and the '55 comes out in '54 - that's the way it works - but that's the dream. So life goes on and the dream is still the American dream and yet we haven't attained that and we still struggle with things. In Tin Men, it was because every Tin Man wanted the Cadillac because that meant they were a success. So it has always been the symbol of success in America, so that I've always used it in one way or another.</p> <p>Q11: Do you have one?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> My father had one, as soon as we moved to suburbia and we had enough money, he got that Cadillac. </p> <p><strong>Q12:</strong> Would you like to make a film about the film business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know, it would depend on what the . . . I mean I've done it in a peripheral way. . .</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Well, isn't Wag the Dog really a kind of a film about the movie business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes and how politics is the movie business, yes. I mean, so the movie business has crept into everything and certainly politics because it is a show. They need to do very much the same kind of way - they've taken more and more film techniques, in fact some of the candidates even work with directors about how to speak to an audience and what's the most effective way to do that, and so, yeah it does link up. The closest I came to it was this film called Jimmy Hollywood, which I don't really know if it was shown over here. Which was Joe Pesci and it was a really kind of modern Hollywood, which was run-down and derelict, and you have a guy who is really not mentally stable in many ways who dreams and aspires to be an actor, and because of circumstance where people think he is some kind of vigilante, he begins to play out a role and begins to think of himself in those terms. But not the film business, the inner workings of it, no.</p> <p><strong>Q13:</strong> What was your continuing creative involvement with Homicide after you'd actually directed the first episode and green-lit it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In terms of scripts, stories that we're going to do, I'd look at rough cuts, make suggestions.</p> <p><strong>Q14:</strong> When are we going to see the last of the series - when are Channel Four going to show them?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> We've been talking about that tonight, whether the National Film Theatre - if we can't get it on British television - whether we can get the episodes that haven't been screened in the UK. Here, as you can tell, there is a lot of enthusiasm for that, Barry.</p> <p><strong>Q15:</strong> When you shot Wag the Dog, you shot it quickly. Was it strange to sit back and see life imitating art?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Both things, I mean we shot it very fast, we shot it in 29 days, we were supposed to shoot it in 30 but we started going so fast that we couldn't stop, y'know. And we had to do it very quickly and we did it very inexpensively, even though we had big movie stars. And then of course, obviously when events began to be close to what happened in Wag the Dog, it was shocking. To have the fact that we had a girl scout and Monica Lewinsky and they both wore berets, I mean it was. And there was a sexual act that happened in the White House and then ultimately, the bombing raid that took place, it was almost surrealistic how close it was. The ultimate irony of it, in one way and sometimes it's a little bit like, y'know you go, \"Good\". There was phenomenal reviews, except in Washington DC, and secondly the critic took us to task by saying: \"It's a stupid title for a movie, y'know, Wag the Dog\" and suddenly to turn around within six weeks to have Kissinger saying on the news \"This is not a Wag the Dog scenario\". Wag the Dog became a part of the language. And also to take task that we didn't know enough about politics because these things cannot occur and etc etc. All of these things started to occur, so I got a private joy out of that. But it is odd when you do something and how similar things are, that can happen in life. I was pretty shocked. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>Q16:</strong> I just wanted to say that Liberty Heights is wonderful - are we going to have anymore Baltimore movies?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> That's a hard question. One, I don't know if, I mean I have certain ideas and I also think it gets more difficult to do those, it gets more and more difficult to do kind of smaller, not that it's small, because it's actually fairly difficult to do those, there is over 5,000 extras and we're all over the city. Most of the things that you see don't quite exist like that. The street with all of the clubs, that doesn't exist and a lot of things had to be faked for the film. But it gets harder to do films about people. Not extraordinary people, just people. And it's harder to sell them and the marketplace gets more, kind of big event, ride films - when you read a review it's a \"real ride\". I'm still of the mind that if it's a ride, you get on the thing and you go for a ride but that the ride in a theatre has to deal with people, it has to deal with character and some of the things that I can relate to. And not that there isn't room for the some of the other things, but that you'd like to have the blend but it is getting more and more squeezed out of the market place. I mean I don't know a James Bond. That's not something I relate to on a normal basis. I can enjoy one of those movies, but I don't know a James Bond. I also like to see the things that I sort of know about, that happen in the society that we live in and the world we live in today. But it gets more and more difficult all of the time. </p> <p><strong>Q17:</strong> What the process you follow when it's not a script that you've originated, what kind of input do you have? Do you rewrite? I know in Levinson on Levinson, you talked about working with James Herbert, perhaps you could just generally talk about working with other script writers.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Ultimately I have to be comfortable enough with the material and with the dialogue and everything else. Sometimes I will change dialogue or work with an actor and fix things if it doesn't sound right to my ear, so you modify and change things, even on scripts that you're not considered a writer. Scenes, etc, a number of things that take place. But certainly in terms of dialogue, it has to feel comfortable enough to my ear because if it doesn't, then I keep thinking something's wrong. Sometimes it's not the performance, the dialogue sticks out as something isn't natural enough for me.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> At that point we have to stop, I'm afraid but we have got a lovely clip of Rain Man for you to end this evening. I'd like to thank the Guardian, Warner Brothers. Barry Levinson for giving us a wonderful new movie, Liberty Heights. I'd like most of all to thank Barry Levinson himself for being our guest this evening. </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">On cuts that the studio wanted to make to Diner</a> (53 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">On his childhood</a> (1min 28) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">On film language and editing</a> (1min 16) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Life imitating art in Wag the Dog</a> (1min 41)</p>",
  "<p>When the artist Robert Rauschenberg was a boy, his mother used to make him shirts from scraps of fabric. Collage shirts. She even made herself a skirt from the back of the suit that her brother Luther was buried in, because she didn't want the material to go to waste. For his high school graduation present, Rauschenberg wanted a ready-made shirt, his first. A decade or so later he made history with assemblages of junk: sculptures made of packing crates, rocks and rope; and paintings sewn from fabric strips. </p> <p>Now, on an August evening, Rauschenberg is home making stew to the dull murmur of a television set. He has a television on all the time, even in the studio. He cooks the way he makes art: ingredients change, spur of the moment. He's an improviser, like his mother, resuscitating scraps. </p> <p>When he settled in Captiva, a slender island off Florida's Gulf coast, 30 years ago, he lived in a beach house and worked out of a studio so small he couldn't get back far enough to see the paintings he was working on. So he built a wall away from the house to lean the paintings against. He would scramble up to his kitchen and look through the window, the only way to get a good view. \"It was magical,\" he says. \"There were only 500 people on the island. At the time everybody in New York was migrating to the Hamptons. Not me.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg is now Captiva's biggest residential landowner. He bought the adjacent properties from elderly neighbours, whom he let live rent-free in their homes. He accumulated 35 acres, 1,000ft of beach front and nine houses. He has almost all that remains of tropical jungle on the island. He has another studio, a 17,000sq ft behemoth overlooking a swimming pool. His assistants call it the Taj Mahal. Sometimes sea otters wander into the pool from the gulf. </p> <p>Rauschenberg was initially intimidated by the palatial studio, and hesitated before settling in. He took a while to adjust to a new house, too, dawdling for months before leaving his old place. The living room of the new house is the size of the entire old house and empty except for pictures on the walls, a couch at one end and, at the other, a ping-pong table. </p> <p>At 74, he is an American institution, the paradoxical fact of an anti-orthodox career. Nine people work for him - several of whom have been with him for decades - including a computer specialist, welders and fabricators. (\"I hate the word fabricator,\" he says, joking as usual. \"It means liar, doesn't it?\") The materials he and his assistants now use reflect the price of the art, his early work having been notoriously ephemeral, to the distress of collectors who paid fortunes for it. By contrast, the recent work is extravagantly durable. </p> <p>There is a gardener who doubles as a frame-maker, and a secretary who helps with the plumbing. All are part of a small industry and also \"a small family\", in the words of Rauschenberg's friend and assistant Darryl Pottorf, who designed the new studio and house. Pottorf, whose brother Kevin works here as well, has been around for 20 years. </p> <p>\"I'm a lousy boss,\" Rauschenberg says, looking at Pottorf. </p> <p>\"You're not a boss,\" Pottorf says. </p> <p>\"That's what I mean.\" Rauschenberg smiles, perhaps not for the first time at this exchange. </p> <p>His latest show, Synapsis Shuffle, at the Whitney Museum in New York, has not been warmly received - like a lot of his work in recent years. But, materials aside, he continues to make art the way he always has, as if it were the equivalent of breathing, and he sustains an optimistic equanimity toward the results. Jasper Johns once said that no American artist has invented more than Rauschenberg. Creatively, he is still the most irrepressible artist. </p> <p>For Synapsis Shuffle he asked a group that included lifestyle guru Martha Stewart and choreographer Merce Cunningham to curate their own show from 52 of his photo-transfer panels. Everyone picked lots to establish the order of selection. Chance and collaboration, the two biggest themes in Rauschenberg's career, were to be linked with an element of irony, although that may have got lost in the shuffle. \"I wanted people who were supposed to be 'experts',\" he says, making quotation marks in the air, \"to make art.\" </p> <p>He had also thought of having a dozen taxi drivers pick the panels. \"The museum asked me about the lights, the floor, but a work like this has got to exist on its own, with its own muscles and mistakes,\" he says. </p> <p>Muscles. As with found objects and materials, Rauschenberg uses words sneakily. He mentions that when he used to play Scrabble with his mother (she died last year at the age of 97) the two of them accepted made-up words if they agreed that the words ought to be in the dictionary. </p> <p>\"Screwing things up is a virtue,\" he explains. \"Being correct is never the point. I have a fanatically correct assistant, and by the time she re-spells my words and corrects my punctuation, I can't read what I wrote. Being right can stop all the momentum of a very interesting idea.\" So with Rauschenberg you go with the flow. His flow. Serendipity and also control: the essence of his art. </p> <p>He is garrulous, mildly naughty, more resilient physically than he ought to be, adept at disguising whatever might be his temper or disappointment. These days he has a half-dozen projects percolating. He's designing announcements for a new Cunningham performance. He just signed off on prints for Al Gore's campaign, to raise money for the Democratic Party, and for Hillary Clinton: elephants seen from the rear, a broom, a donkey. \"No point being subtle,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I usually work in a direction until I know how to do it, then I stop,\" he says. \"At the time that I am bored or understand - I use those words interchangeably - another appetite has formed. A lot of people try to think up ideas; I'm not one. I'd rather accept the irresistible possibilities of what I can't ignore.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg has just finished a series for another autumn show in New York. He says it is about struggling against what he knows how to do. The works in the living room belong to that series. Meanwhile, two years' labour on a mural for a Renzo Piano cathedral in Italy, commissioned by the Vatican, has gone for naught, he says disgustedly. The Vatican didn't like his representation of God as a gold satellite dish. \"You know, a halo, and also something that hears everything.\" Rauschenberg is perfectly sincere. Having once thought of becoming a priest, he may have had more invested in this project than in others. He backed out rather than discuss changes. </p> <p>On the television at that moment is Lauren Hutton. Rauschenberg touches the screen. Hutton is the host of an annual benefit he organises for an abused women's shelter in Fort Myers, Florida. Rauschenberg raises or donates hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for charities for women, children, medical research, politicians, artists. A chunk of his time - too much, you can sense he thinks - now goes into being Robert Rauschenberg, which is not the same as making Robert Rauschenbergs. </p> <p>Certainly this is not what he imagined 50 years ago, when nobody wanted anything from him. Or almost nobody. The often reproduced photographs of him and Susan Weil making silhouette negatives on blueprint paper, Rauschenberg's breakthrough pictures, were for Life magazine in 1951. There was other media attention too. But it was harder to succeed in the New York art world after the war than it had been during it. Peggy Guggenheim's gallery was closed. So was Stuart Levy's. Many of the European artists who had waited out Hitler in New York, enlarging the local culture, had returned to Europe. Duchamp was around but lying low. </p> <p>\"Jasper and I broke into his privacy,\" Rauschenberg says. \"Duchamp knew who we were because his wife knew everyone. She was his reporter. Everyone was trying to give up European aesthetics then. That was the struggle, and it was reflected in the fear of collectors and critics. The musician John Cage said that fear in life is the fear of change. If I may add to that: nothing can avoid changing. Because life doesn't have any other possibility, everyone can be measured by his adaptability to change.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg and Cage became friends not when they were at Black Mountain College, as people think, but after Cage visited Rauschenberg's first show, at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1951, and asked for one of the paintings. He was the only person who did. Cage and Rauschenberg met up a year later at Rauschenberg's loft, where the only place to sit was on the mattress. Cage started to itch. He called later and said that he was going away for a while so Rauschenberg should stay over at his place because that mattress must have bedbugs. At Cage's apartment, Rauschenberg decided to touch up the painting Cage had acquired, as a thank you. He painted it black, as he was in the midst of his all-black period. Cage returned. He was not amused. </p> <p>\"We both thought, 'Here is somebody crazier than I am,'\" Rauschenberg recalls. \"That's why we got along so well. John said I was natural Zen, while he had to choose between studying Zen or going to a psychiatrist, and Zen seemed like the better alternative.\" </p> <p>Cage also recognised what you might call the sympathetic music in Rauschenberg's art - the silence of the all-white paintings, for example. Even the famous Automobile Tire Print, for which Cage drove his Model A Ford over a strip of paper that Rauschenberg unrolled outside his studio in 1951, was a \"concrete\" score, as well as a swipe at Barnett Newman's \"zip\" paintings. At least, like a score, it was a printed version of their performance. </p> <p>\"I was mostly rejected by the visual art world,\" Rauschenberg says about the early 1950s. \"But this led me to be involved with musicians and dancers and they became my friends. Not just John and Merce but also Morty Feldman, Christian Wolff, Earle Brown. The problems they were having had a lot more to do with painting than the people who were whining about how the latest collector in town had bought a de Kooning instead of one of their paintings. </p> <p>\"Art can be like furniture - static, clumsy. The point of collaboration is to counteract that. For me, art shouldn't be a fixed idea that I have before I start making it. I want it to include all the fragility and doubt that I go through the day with. Sometimes I'll take a walk just to forget whatever good idea I had that day because I like to go into the studio not having any ideas. I want the insecurity of not knowing, like performers feel before a performance. Everything I know, I have probably already done, or somebody else has.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg recalls an idea he once had for an exhibition of paintings imitating different abstract expressionists. \"Imagine the luxury, the energy and the iridescent glory of doing a Rothko,\" he says. \"Of course, it would have been blaspheming, but can you think what it would be like to throw yourself into that incredible mood? Then out of respect I decided I wouldn't paint like Rothko or Franz Kline because I'd be in their way and they in mine.\" </p> <p>He's smiling again. </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 New York Times</p>",

  "Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, used his speech at the United Nations millennium summit yesterday to mount his strongest challenge yet to American plans for a new missile defence system. <p>He was speaking on the opening day of the summit, the biggest-ever meeting of world leaders. </p> <p>Mr Putin sought to rally opposition to the US plan, dubbed \"son of star wars\", by calling for an international conference to discuss banning military hardware from space. Russia would host the conference, he said. </p> <p>China and many other countries, including European ones, are also opposed to the US plan. </p> <p>Washington claims it needs the missile defence system to protect itself against countries such as North Korea Iraq and Iran, but President Bill Clinton has left the dilemma of whether to go ahead to his successor. </p> <p>Mr Putin, who is on his first trip to the US as Russia's president, said that \"plans for the militarisation of space\" amounted to a return to the arms race. They would contravene the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, a \"foundation of the entire nuclear arms control system\". </p> <p>More than 150 world leaders have gathered at the three-day summit, primarily to discuss reform of the UN. As well as the summit, there will be a closed session of the security council today in which contentious issues such as Iraq will be discussed. </p> <p>In a farewell address at the UN, Mr Clinton yesterday urged world leaders to intensify efforts to fight poverty and war, put more children in school and fight the spread of infectious diseases. </p> <p>He referred to both east Timor and Sierra Leone. \"In both cases the UN did not have the tools to finish the job,\" he said. \"We must provide those tools, with peacekeepers that can be rapidly deployed with the right training and equipment, missions well-defined and well-led, with the necessary civilian police.\" </p> <p>He and Tony Blair both denounced the Burmese military for locking up the opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. </p> <p>\"We face another test today in Burma, where a brave and popular leader once again has been confined with her supporters in prison and her country in distress, in defiance of repeated UN resolutions,\" Mr Clinton said. </p> <p>Ms Suu Kyi and other senior members of the opposition National League for Democracy have been padlocked inside their residences for four days after the military forcibly ended a nine-day roadside protest early on Saturday. </p> <p>Mr Blair said: \"The treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi by the Burmese regime is a disgrace. I call upon the Burmese government to let her go free, and I call on fellow world leaders to back that call.\"</p>",
  "At least four UN refugee workers were murdered yesterday in west Timor and their office destroyed when thousands of pro-Indonesian militiamen attacked the building during a rampage through the area. <p>Several other staff from international aid organisations in the Indonesian territory helping the tens of thousands of east Timorese refugees in camps around the town of Atambua were injured. One Brazilian woman was repeatedly attacked by an axe-wielding militiaman. </p> <p>All foreign workers in the town were evacuated. Some fled to the provincial capital, Kupang, while four UN helicopters airlifted 55 to the town of Balibo in east Timor. </p> <p>Last night, as reports came in that the militiamen were heading towards Kupang, the UN in Jakarta announced that it would evacuate all its staff from west Timor today and would assist any international organisations wishing to pull out their employees. </p> <p>It is unclear what fate awaits the east Timorese refugees who have been terrorised by the militia since they were forced to flee their homeland when pro-Jakarta thugs went on a rampage after the territory voted overwhelmingly for independence in August 1999. </p> <p>Yesterday's attack on staff working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees began when about 20 trucks full of militia, many armed with machetes and homemade rifles, pulled up in front of their Atambua office, a local eyewitness said. \"They first lit fires in front of the office and then threw stones at the windows and fired into the office,\" he said. \"They then set fire to one of the UNHCR cars before attacking the office itself. The building was destroyed.\" </p> <p>At least three bodies were dragged out of the office in the ensuing carnage, he said. \"They were dumped in front of the building and set on fire.\" </p> <p>Police sources said that an Ethiopian, a Puerto Rican, a Croatian and a Malaysian were killed and that one other person might be missing. </p> <p>The militiamen, who had gathered in the town the previous evening to mourn a murdered leader, were joined by thousands of colleagues and then set off in search of the approximately 25 foreigners living in Atambua. Several buildings were destroyed and locals who had helped international organisations were attacked. </p> <p>Neither the Indonesian police, whose office is less than 100 yards from the UNHCR office, nor the military, made any serious attempt to intervene until later. None of the attackers was arrested. </p> <p>The west Timor military commander, Colonel Jurefar, said his troops could not control the militiamen. \"We tried to quell the situation but some just went wild.\" </p> <p>The UN high commissioner for refugees, Sadako Ogata, said she was deeply disappointed at the failure of the Indonesian authorities to make good on their commitment to protect her staff. \"These were peaceful, unarmed humanitarians who gave their lives trying to help those who had lost everything in conflict,\" she said. </p> <p>Many of the foreigners had only returned to Atambua this week, when the UNHCR decided it was safe enough to resume operations in the area after three staff were badly beaten up in a west Timor refugee camp last month. </p> <p>Sulaiman Abdulmanan, the Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman, said his government was appalled by the incident. He insisted that the authorities were not actively supporting the militia. But diplomats in Jakarta have said they have conclusive proof that elements of the Indonesian military are actively training and equipping the militia.</p>",
  "Leaders of the West Side Boys holding six Royal Irish regiment soldiers hostage near Freetown want Britain to guarantee them safe passage out of Sierra Leone and to provide them with an education abroad. <p>The demand is apparently modelled on a deal five years ago in which Sierra Leone's former military ruler, Valentine Strasser, was admitted to Warwick university to remove him from the political scene. </p> <p>The scheme has been put to British officials by Johnny Paul Koroma, another former military ruler once served by the West Side Boys. He now heads the government's peace commission. Mr Koroma revealed the demand after relatives of the hostage takers returned from a visit to the village where the captives are held, about 30 miles from Freetown. </p> <p>\"Some of them want to get out of the country,\" he said. \"They want to study in some vocational institute so that when they come back later they will be useful to the country. </p> <p>\"I think the bottom line is fear. We will talk to the British, we will talk to the government, to guarantee their security.\" </p> <p>There is little chance that the West Side Boys' 24-year-old leader, the frequently drugged and drunk \"Brigadier\" Foday Kallay, will find himself at St Andrews with Prince William. His last job was as a gateman at the defence ministry. </p> <p>If nothing else, Warwick's experience with Mr Strasser will deter many British universities from taking on former fighters. After his fellow students found out about his bloody past, he dropped out of his law studies and became a nightclub bouncer. </p> <p>But it is quite possible that another African country can be persuaded to accept Brig Kallay and his cohorts for some kind of training programme as a contribution to peace in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>\"We've not specified any country at all,\" Mr Koroma said. \"Wherever they want to send them; it might be Nigeria, it might be Ghana or Zambia, it might be any country in Africa. It is not necessarily Britain.\" </p> <p>The West Side Boys want those fighters who are not sent abroad to be guaranteed places in Sierra Leone's new British-trained army. </p> <p>British officials have declined to comment while negotiations continue but the proposals could indicate that the Boys have backed away from their original demand for the release of two of their leaders and other comrades from prison,and are seeking a way out of the hostage crisis. </p> <p>Such a deal would also have the attraction of removing the West Side Boys as a violent and maverick force so close to Freetown. </p> <p>Brig Kallay has told relatives he fears that if he frees the British captives his fighters will be vulnerable to attack by the Sierra Leone army or UN forces. His elder brother, Maxim Sesay, said the renegade leader was seeking assurances from the British for his security. \"He wants to come out but he has no confidence in this present government,\" Mr Sesay said. \"They have arrested some of his brothers [in the West Side Boys]. He himself is afraid because of what he has done.\" </p> <p>In an attempt to reassure the hostage takers, Sierra Leone's attorney general yesterday said he had no plans to prosecute them for holding the soldiers captive. But the government is known to be split on the issue.</p>",
  "<p>A US mining company planning a takeover of RJB Mining was yesterday facing a possible lawsuit after claims that it ranked among America's worst polluters. </p> <p>Environmental activists are considering a class action against Doe Run, a lead mining company owned by the Renco corporation of America, brought on behalf of at least 100 people.</p> <p>The possible environmental action is one of several lawsuits filed against mining companies owned by Renco, the private company which is in talks to buy RJB Mining, the British coal mining group. RJB is likely to be questioned on the takeover talks when it an nounces its interim results today. Sources close to the company said a deal was unlikely to be announced today as Renco was still finalising the details of a takeover offer for the British group. Discussions started in June.</p> <p>The possibility of a class action lawsuit in an area where it has taken steps to improve its environmental record is an embarrassment for Renco, which was dubbed \"one of the biggest air polluters in America\" by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Both Doe Run and the Magnesium Corporation of America, a Utah-based mine group owned by Renco, have repeatedly clashed with the US government over environmental failures.</p> <p>The latest action concerns alleged air and water pollution by Doe Run's operations in south-eastern Missouri. A leading US law firm which specialises in bringing consumer complaints against big corporations contacted the local branch of the Sierra Club, a US environmental group, last week to suggest working together on a possible class action.</p> <p>Ken Midkiff, a director at the Ozark chapter of the club, said that his team had documented air pollution, greenish-black water and dead fish in local rivers in recent weeks. He said: \"It's a moonscape.\"</p> <p>Jeff Zelms, president of Doe Run, said that his company's environmental performance had improved significantly at the most contentious site.</p>",
  "The London arm of the Japanese bank Nomura International has become one of the City's biggest movers and shakers. <p>Under the control of Guy Hands, a close friend of William Hague, Nomura has snapped up bargains across British industry. It took over 57,000 Ministry of Defence properties, bought over 5,000 pubs and took a slice of the privatised railways. Only last month it just missed out on buying a Welsh water company and admitted taking a look at BAe Systems, the country's second largest defence contractor. </p> <p>But the dome might be the best deal of all. Some experts believe the 63 acres it would acquire in Greenwich along with the dome could be the next Canary Wharf. For \u00a3108m it could be sitting on assets in future valued in billions. </p> <p>British property group Quintain Estates and Development recently bought land adjoining the dome and believes the area, which is only separated from Canary Wharf by a few feet of water, is an obvious candidate for huge redevelopment. </p> <p>Nick Shattock, a Quintain director with responsibility for its Greenwich site, last night said: \"Canary Wharf will be fully let by 2003 and then the search is on for the next Canary Wharf. There is the Elephant and Castle and Paddington Basin but this site (Greenwich) is definitely a contender.\" He points out that riverside land attracts values of \u00a35m per acre in Wandsworth, up river. The 63 acres to be bought by Nomura could be worth almost three times the amount it paid. </p> <p>It underlines why David James, incoming chairman of the New Millenium Experience Company said yesterday that the dome was being sold for a fraction of its value and Nomura stood to make a \"killing\". </p> <p>Mr Shattock points out that the Greenwich peninsula already has the biggest tube station in Europe with a 10 minute ride to the City. The underground is being used at only 10% of capacity, a position which compares with Canary Wharf itself which suffered badly in its early stages from a poorly performing Docklands light railway. </p> <p>But Mr Shattock says no mega development at Greenwich can be guaranteed. It will depend on a scheme being approved inside an urban development plan being drawn up by Greenwich council and the Greater London authority. </p> <p>Nomura admits it has plans to build some residential and commercial properties on the dome land but says this is only a secondary aspect of its purchase. A spokesman for the company said last night: \"Nomura wants to buy the dome to make it into a successful entertainment venue. That is why we are bringing in Hyper Entertainment, an offshoot of Sony, to transform the place over three years.\" </p> <p>Nomura has agreed to run the dome as a visitor attraction for the next 15 years but after that it appears able to reconsider its plans and demolition must be an option. </p> <p>The Japanese bank is no stranger to controversy. When it bought the Ministry of Defence properties at bargain basement prices and then sold them on making huge profits, the government was criticised by the national audit office.</p>",
  "A judge yesterday suggested that it was not God's will that the weaker of the Siamese twins at the centre of a landmark appeal should live. <p>Lord Justice Ward put forward the argument that it could not have been intended that severely disabled Mary, who only survives because she is connected to her sister Jodie, should be kept alive. </p> <p>The judge's remarks came as independent doctors, who were asked to give a second opinion on the girls, said they broadly agreed that the twins should be separated, against the wishes of the parents. </p> <p>The judge also admitted the case had caused him sleepless nights. </p> <p>The parents of Mary and Jodie are appealing against a high court ruling giving doctors at St Mary's hospital in Manchester the go-ahead to separate the twins, though the operation would lead to Mary's death. </p> <p>Devout Catholics, they have said they want nature to take its course despite warnings that if the operation does not take place, both girls will die. In written evidence, they have declared that they do not believe that it is God's will that the twins should be separated. </p> <p>Lord Justice Ward's comments seemed to bring into conflict the Christian philosophies enshrined in English law and the faith of the parents, who are only in Britain because their remote European community lacked the medical expertise to deal with the girls. </p> <p>The judge said: \"It was not God's will that this baby [Mary] should live because it was not born with the capacity to live ... nobody in their right mind would hook this child on to a life support system, given the utter deformity of her heart and lungs.\" </p> <p>David Harris QC, for the official solicitor, who is representing Mary, replied that the law was underpinned by the belief that it was not God's will that man should terminate life. Allowing the operation to take place would result in Mary's life being lost. </p> <p>Mr Harris also addressed the question of whether it was in Mary's \"best interests\" that her life be continued. She has no functioning heart or lungs, relying on her sister for oxygenated blood and doctors have raised the \"horrendous\" scenario of Jodie growing strong enough to drag her sister around with her, whether or not Mary wanted this. But Mr Harris said there was no conclusive proof that she was in pain. \"Although this is a life of short duration, there is insufficient evidence that it is so intolerable as to render it in the child's best interests that it should end.\" </p> <p>He insisted that it would be unlawful to carry out an operation which would lead to the death of Mary. The only option available to those who wanted the operation, he said, was to invite the court to make a radical exception to the existing principles. This would \"undoubtedly be fundamentally inconsistent with the underpinning philosophy and ethics of the legal structure as it stands.\" </p> <p>However, Lord Justice Ward argued: \"You invite us to treat her as a single independent life when everyone knows that if she had been born a single person she would have been left to die. She is unnaturally hooked on to her sister, and, in the end, is going to kill her sister.\" </p> <p>The court was told that a surgeon experienced in treating Siamese twins and a paediatric cardiologist broadly supported proposals by doctors at St Mary's to separate the month-old girls. </p> <p>Consultants from Great Ormond Street hospital in London were sent in at the request of the three appeal court judges. </p> <p>The judges adjourned the case until next Wednesday, when judgment is expected to be reserved.</p>",

  "<p>Derek, a wardrobe of a man, isn't the kind of bloke you'd want shouting at you, especially first thing on a Sunday morning, especially if he was your dad, and especially if you were only 10 and not confident enough to shout back. </p> <p>Yet from what we see of him in <strong> Modern Times </strong> (BBC2), he shouts a lot, mainly at his young sons, Ojay and Troy, for their lack of footballing abilities. Derek is the male equivalent of a pushy showbiz mum. He's a pushy footballing dad, one of many who stand round Sunday morning pitches shouting at their sons to attack more, defend better and stop standing about like a nancy boy. I blame the parents. </p> <p>On one level, Modern Times lent itself to pseudo-Freudian, pop psychology judgements about pot-bellied men trying to relive their youth by commandeering their sons' lives. Then there was the idea that these men felt professional football, rather than academic endeavour, was the only path to success. But it also spawned sympathy for these blustering blokes when they expressed regret over their relationships with their own dads. </p> <p>Heavens, pondering crises in masculinity is exhausting. I could do with half an orange. </p> <p>Do kids still form bands when they're at school? Or are they all too busy setting up internet companies, being DJs and having unprotected sex with the gay abandon of horny mountain goats? Is being in a band a bit last century? It certainly felt that way in <strong> Young Guns Go For It </strong> (BBC2), which charted the rise and fall of Spandau Ballet (from Islington to Nassau and back again) in all its nasty 80s glory. From Tony Hadley crying at the end of his bed because he wanted success so much, all the way to the champagne, expensive video shoots and stadium gigs, Young Guns Go For It was the usual tawdry mixture of bad outfits, rock'n'roll excess and let-that-be-a-lesson-to-you crash-and-burn endings. </p> <p>All in, it didn't feel very Wednesday night. More of a Saturday thing. So if you'd set your internal clock by this odd scheduling decision, you'd be reading this on your way to church. </p> <p>\"I'm mad for jellies\", Nigella exclaimed in <strong> Nigella Bites</strong> (C4) with the fervour of an evangelical temazepam addict from a sinkhole estate in Glasgow. But no heroin substitutes for La Lawson (not very west London, though she must have the spoons for it), for she was talking of wibbly-wobbly rhubarb and muscat wine jellies which she makes, perhaps especially, to go with her softly-softly pink cardigan. The pink cardigan is, of course, infinitely preferable to that denim jacket which she wore all last week - and inexplicably slipped on to make last night's Caesar salad. But even that odd clothing decision pales into insignificance on the weirdness scale compared to the voluminous swaddling clothes she donned to whip up some hummus with Greek yoghurt (\"and I mean Greek yoghurt\") and strangle bundles of green beans with prosciutto. Beautiful in a drained sort of way - and in another time, she'd suffer awfully from consumption and have to retire to Eastbourne for sea air - even Nigella couldn't avoid looking like a reindeer herder in her peculiar ensemble. Still, it should keep her warm every time she ventures into her deep freeze, where this week she revealed her bags of frozen wine. The woman is clearly mad. </p> <p>As holiday souvenirs go, an admiration for Fidel Castro, a determination to break a blockade and a yearning to show solidarity with the Cuban people are more worthwhile than 200 cigarettes and a monkey carved out of coconut shell, but there aren't many folks who'd be so affected by their bonnes vacances , they'd get involved in international affairs. Yet as <strong> Picture This: Photo to Castro</strong> (BBC2) showed, Tony Caccavone, a London cabbie, was so affected by his trip to Havana, he painted his cab the colours of the Cuban flag and went to America to take part in an aid convoy to Cuba via Canada in direct violation of US law. With a priest from Preston in the back of his taxi, the odd couple's journey to meet Castro was charted with warmth and humanity. And when the pair finally met the Cuban leader, it was glorious and uplifting. Hardly ground-breaking or revelatory, Picture This was still a little piece of magic, dispelling the myth that there's such a thing as an \"ordinary\" person.</p>",
  "Problems with North Korea, Iraq and a series of other disputes overshadowed the UN millennium summit in New York. <p>The US president, Bill Clinton, listed them in his speech to the summit: the Middle East, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Yugoslavia.</p> <p>He singled out the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, as one of the worst offenders in the international community in the past 10 years.</p> <p>Addressing the summit, the prime minister, Tony Blair, referred to the \"dismal failure of the world in Africa\".

It is also weakened by the continuing veto held by the five security council permanent members: Britain, France, the US, China and Russia.</p> <p>In spite of a British proposal this week to expand the membership, the security council meeting today will not address fundamental reform but instead concentrate on current issues, such as the sanctions imposed on Iraq.</p>",
  "Desperate to build up its nuclear arsenal in the early years of the cold war, the US government secretly hired hundreds of private companies to process radioactive material without informing workers or local residents of the risks, according to a newspaper report published yesterday. <p>USA Today said that the companies - some of them no more than family-run workshops - heated, milled and cut to shape tonnes of uranium, thorium, polonium, beryllium and other radioactive substances for use in the production of atomic weapons. </p> <p>Often safety equipment was installed only as an afterthought, many years later, and some workers were exposed to daily radiation levels hundreds of times the maximum safe dose. </p> <p>According to the report, which the paper said was based on 10 months' research, there have been no studies of the workers and residents to discover how many fell ill and died as a result of their exposure to radiation, but it cited a handful of anecdotal cases of cancer and liver failure. It said that several sites, where factories spewed dust into the air or groundwater, were still radioactive today. </p> <p>Congress and the White House are reviewing legislation to compensate workers at government-run factories who contracted cancer or other radiation-induced diseases while working on the weapons programme, but it does not include private factories coopted during the headlong rush to nuclear armament in the 1940s and 1950s. </p> <p>The report quotes from information leaflets distributed to workers telling them that the work posed no special dangers.

  "The fundamental conflict between the jealously guarded sovereign powers of nation states and the constantly evolving but as ever ill-defined supranational role of the United Nations overshadows this week's New York millennium summit. In theory, more than 150 heads of government have come together to tackle global problems of poverty, education, democracy and human rights. In practice, the implementation of any resulting initiatives will be subject to the test of national self-interest, applied 150 times over. And as always, any and all subsequent (and glumly predictable) failures will be blamed not on the countries concerned but on the hapless UN itself. <p>This cynical, convenient scapegoating, this game of musical chairs in which it is Kofi Annan who is always left standing when the orchestra stops, cannot be allowed to go on. As the secretary general has made clear, the UN ultimately can achieve only that which its members wish. This reality applies with particular force to those nation states which hold permanent security council membership. Yet paradoxically, the US, the most powerful of them all, is frequently the least supportive of legitimate UN aspirations (such as the international criminal court) and the quickest to blame the UN when things go wrong. In its haughty disdain for the UN, the US congress places itself in oddly roguish alliance with states like Iraq and Serbia which repudiate the UN's authority on essentially identical grounds - the quasi-neurotic safeguarding of sovereign power. </p> <p>The UN suffers from many avoidable problems, as Mr Annan freely acknowledges. Its peacekeeping operations are frequently shambolic, its numerous agencies too often beset by bureaucracy, incompetence and pernicious patronage (perpetuated by nation state purse-hold ers). From the security council down, its proceedings lack transparency and democratic scrutiny. Its clout is potentially undermined by parallel organisations like the World Trade Organisation, the IMF and G7. But if it is to fulfil its potential as the leading, indeed only, inclusive permanent global forum, as a force for good rather than an excuse for failure, the basic, debilitating disconnection between national means and agreed international ends must be overcome. </p> <p>If that means demanding that Russia or China relinquish their veto powers and embrace a community of equals, dream on. Yet a modern trend towards the ceding or relaxing of the traditional sovereign prerogatives of nation states is already discernible. The Organisation of African Unity, for example, recently accepted the principle of intervention in a country's internal affairs. Regional economic organisations like Asean move slowly but perceptibly towards common, binding political platforms. Sovereign states recognise an ever-growing body of supranational law, conventions and treaties, governing not just trade and defence, as in the past, but human rights and environmental standards. And what else is the EU but an ever greater pooling of national sovereignty? </p> <p>Britain's proposals, tabled yesterday by Tony Blair, to expand the security council and professionalise peacekeeping, are useful but partial steps towards creating a stronger, credible UN. The logic of such measures extends much further, towards the goal of a truly democratic world body supported and empowered rather than subjugated and subverted by its elite members. If a UN did not exist, one would have to be invented. Acknowledging that by their presence, New York's 150 leading lights must cede to it the power to succeed.</p>",
  "<p>A disappointing silly season is coming to a close. You expect, at the least, the occasional flesh-eating virus by mid-July. You expect panthers loose on Dartmoor.

They will be expected to tell us how they intend to pay for their manifesto pledges. By way of a response, they may well lie to us - but the fun is in the asking, isn't it?</p>",

The aim is to raise funds to pay for the use of intellectual property. </p> <p>As such, it represents a contribution to the debate sparked off by attempts in the US to curb MP3 sites like Napster. </p> <p>But it will also revive the debate on Germany's will to modernise, and it raises more questions than it answered. </p> <p>Representatives of the information technology industry in Germany said it would be a tax on progress. </p> <p>J\u00f6rg Menno Harms, of Bitkom, which represents the German new media industries, told the newspaper Berliner Zeitung: \"In no other country in the world would consideration be given to such a wide-ranging regulation.\" </p> <p>The paper said the industry reckoned that the tax could add up to 30% to the cost of the equipment affected. </p> <p>The justice minister in Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's centre-left cabinet, Herta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin, insisted in a statement that the rate would not be punitively high. </p> <p>But she said: \"We have to find ways for authors, journalists, musicians and others engaged in creative activity to receive an appropriate return.\" </p> <p>Germany also imposes similar levies on equipment whose main function is copying, including scanners, photocopiers and fax machines. The rate varies according to the capacity of the machine, from DM75 up to DM600 (\u00a325 to \u00a390) an item. </p> <p>The proceeds are paid by the manufacturers to companies which specialise in collecting royalties on intellectual property, which pass the fees on to clients such as authors, composers and screenplay and software writers. </p> <p>\"Everyone who buys a tape recorder already unwittingly pays a tax which, incidentally, is low,\" Ms D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin said. </p> <p>\"The cost of bringing modern media within the scope of the compensation act by changes to the law will not over-burden the consumer to the extent that representatives of the interest parties have claimed. The inclusion, however, is needed, to protect intellectual property.\" </p> <p>Berliner Zeitung said that since the tax would only be payable when the products were bought in Germany, there were fears that it could prompt hi-tech firms to flee the country or sell their products from abroad by mail order.</p>",
  "In the course of the next month, English life will change, or not, in two fundamental ways. Trial by jury will be curtailed, or not. The right to roam over private land will be created, or not. These are big decisions. They're the stuff of political judgment and even conscience, which in a decent system MPs would determine. But the decisions aren't going to be made by MPs. Whether changes take place will be decided very soon by the House of Lords. <p>The Commons, fully whipped, have done their voting, in line with the wishes of the government. There has been no conscience or judgment about it. Shortage of parliamentary time now gives the Lords much leverage. They can force changes on ministers who want to get the rest of their measures. There will have to be some horse trading, at the behest of a House that consists of two types of people: a rump of hereditary peers, and more than 550 recipients of political patronage over the years. Few voters demonstrate a sense of outrage at this. Some even regard the Lords as a body with more wisdom than the Commons. Such is the degraded respect in which democratic politics is held. </p> <p>Those of us who have retained our capacity for revulsion, however, are now offered a sop. The experiment begins next week. It will be quite something to watch. Out with genetic accident and prime ministerial spoils, in with the modern tools of rational selection. A commission chaired by Lord Stevenson of Coddenham gets to work, not merely proposing but deciding on future non-party members of the Lords, maybe a dozen or more a year. It is the forerunner of a much bigger project, as recommended by the Wakeham committee on Lords reform. If Wakeham ever gets enacted, the only way anyone will become a Lords legislator, whether on the party or non-party ticket, will be by grace and favour of the Stevenson commission. </p> <p>The forms are ready, the website is prepared, the rules will be announced on Wednesday. Anyone can apply for a legislator's seat, or be put up for one. They'll need to be \"suitable\", of proven achievement in their field, and demonstrate a measure of comfort at the prospect of making a speech. Robust independence is what the commissioners will be looking for, though prior membership of a party will apparently not be regarded as a disqualification on that account. </p> <p>In place of baronial birth, or the whim of Tony Blair and his predecessors, comes a politician-factory more reminiscent of Brave New World. The suitability-tests by questionnaire will be extensive. Many candidates will fail for want of distinction. Referees will be required, and there will be sift after sift to detect the genuine article. Nobody knows how many citizens will apply, but when the sift gets down to the last 100 or so, there will have to be interviews since, in this system, unlike the one that's lasted half a century, it cannot be guaranteed that every appointee will be known, one way or another, to those who hand out the honours. </p> <p>They are no longer supposed to be honours, in any case. What seems certainly to be happening is the end of peerages as honours, as well as the reduction of Mr Blair's appointing power. Also the end of the crossbench peer as the fount of singular wisdom. Crossbench peers at present have no obligation to work or vote, and are often too idle or embarrassed to do so at the very times they are needed. A number are phony cross-benchers anyway, pretending not to have party ties. The Stevenson batches will therefore be known as non-party peers, and will be expected to turn up and work. </p> <p>They will have been appointed, moreover, by a commission purified of all possible taint. Each member of it - themselves the fruit of another suitably apolitical tool, the head-hunter's search - will declare every interest under the sun, past, present and possibly future, including not just business links and financial holdings but the more elusive matter of friendship networks. Among themselves they intend to be scrupulously open about who knows whom, to guard against suspicion that something other than absolutely objective criteria is being used. Thus will everyone be insulated from every whiff of impropriety, as the whistle-clean cohorts roll off the production line into the chamber where they'll be empowered to decide the further future, whenever it arises, of jury trial or the right to roam. </p> <p>Will they have a better right to do so than the present lot? Certainly the calibre of a small fragment of peers should improve on the placemen and reward-merchants thrown up by prime ministerial caprice. Dennis Stevenson, as chief appointer, is a man of impeccable disinterest and rampant modernity. The commission will strive for younger peers and ethnic peers and female peers and peers from outside London. If it ever got its hands on the total appointment list, including the party people, we might see an end to the party hackery that wafts many over-age deadbeats, including all former cabinet ministers, into the Lords - which is one reason why the Wakeham package reform is unlikely, in my opinion, to be allowed to happen. </p> <p>But the Stevenson peers, in the end, will have the old problem. The commission proposes going through this rigmarole in order to produce more democratically acceptable choices, a better and more committed House. If it is too explicit about its choices being \"representative\", it could end up in trouble with the law, finding the equal opportunities commission on its tail: one commission chasing another comically up the backside. But the central point of it is to increase the Lords' perceived legitimacy, by appointing a wider spread that will somehow make the second chamber closer to being a proxy parliament of the people. </p> <p>It's charged with going to heavy lengths, in other words, to avert something much simpler. The Stevenson commission is proposed as the model by which a democratic parliament can be avoided. All this inviting and scrutinising and vetting and sorting and squeaky-cleansing, by a group of commissioners who painstakingly drain themselves of every undeclared deformity, is the British establishment's typical halfway house, its historic method of survival: a modest gesture of improvement, masking the preservation of the essential status quo. </p> <p>A Lords to which one could believably entrust the future of jury trial doesn't need to be wholly elected. A tranche of nominees, with single 10-year terms, would add savour and judgment, and the Stevenson commission looks like a good way to find them. But Wakeham's maximum option was for 35% elected peers, its preference for 15% or less. The government's last known figure was zero. The more one observes the de facto power of the Lords increasing, the more such trivial legitimacies seem null and void. The case for far more election gets greater by the vote. Beware all substitutes, the more plausible the fishier. </p> <p> hugoyoung@compuserve.com</p>",
  "Afghanistan's Taliban Islamic militia won a crucial strategic victory in their four-year civil war yesterday, capturing the political base of the ousted government after hours of heavy fighting. <p>For several weeks they have been trying to win control of Taloqan, in northern Afghanistan. They launched a new offensive on three fronts late on Tuesday night and within hours entered the town, claiming they had captured tanks, weapons and 80 prisoners. </p> <p>Troops of the former government admitted that they were in retreat. </p> <p>\"We pulled out of the city to avoid civilian casualties,\" Mohammed Abil, an opposition spokesman, said. \"Our forces are still on the city's outskirts.\" </p> <p>Many of the town's civilians fled in recent weeks as the fighting grew worse. </p> <p>The fall of Taloqan will strengthen the Taliban's demand for international diplomatic recognition, particularly during the current UN summit in New York. </p> <p>\"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan once again requests the Afghan seat at the United Nations,\" the Taliban's foreign ministry said in a statement last night. </p> <p>Although President Burhanuddin Rabbani's ousted government still holds Afghanistan's UN seat, his forces now control only one province, Badakshan, and small slices of territory in the north. </p> <p>Their military base, controlled by the former defence minister Ahmad Shah Masood, is in the Panjsher valley, 70 miles north of Kabul, where steep mountain walls have provided a solid defence since the Soviet occupation. </p> <p>But Taloqan lies on a crucial supply route linking the Panjsher with Tajikistan, which has provided considerable help to Commander Masood's forces. </p> <p>\"This means the loss of the supply route to the Panjsher valley and the opposition will find it now very difficult to get its supplies from outside,\" said Kamal Matinuddin, a retired Pakistani general and a writer on Afghanistan. </p> <p>The opposition may now look to air support for their supplies. Helicopters fly between Tajikistan and the Panjsher, but although the opposition also controls Bagram airbase, close to the valley, heavy fighting in the area makes it too dangerous to use. </p> <p>\"Taloqan is a very important town from the point of view of the opposition. But I don't think it means the end of the fighting,\" Gen Matinuddin said. \" </p> <p>There are still some areas to be taken by the Taliban, especially the Panjsher.\" </p> <p>Taliban fighters said they would now push on to the nearby town of Farkhar, still under opposition control, before trying an assault on Badakshan province.</p>",
  "<p>Animals, particularly male animals, do some weird things before they breed. Songbirds sing, frogs croak, fruitflies dance and throw up. The reason is probably what Darwin called female choice - females tend to breed with the males who sing, and who sing loudest and longest. </p> <p>But Darwin's solution replaces one puzzle with another. Why did females ever evolve to choose males who do such crazy things? That is a harder question, and one that has not yet been fully answered. But part of the answer is going to be that courting animals (and human animals perhaps) are assessing gene quality. We have known for ages that copying accidents -mutations - happen in the genes. What had not been known, until the recent boom in the gene sequencing industry, is the sheer number of mutations. </p> <p>A human being makes 200 or so copying mistakes every time he or she breeds. This is a big number, making it something of a mystery how we can cope. If that number of mutations are introduced each generation, a similar number must somehow be purged. Otherwise our genes would be steadily randomised over time by mutation, and a random set of genes can no more code for a living creature than a random series of letters can code for a Shakespeare play. The mating market does some of the purging. An individual faces two problems when trying to assess the gene quality of another individual. One is how to tell which suitors have good genes, and which have bad. The number of bad genes is not written on an individuals' forehead. Nor can courting couples directly inspect each other's DNA codes and check them for defects. They are in much the same position as someone who wants to buy a second-hand car, and lacks the skills needed to test its components directly. All you can do is take it out for a test drive, and assess its quality from how well it goes. </p> <p>Being courted is a \"proactive\" experience. The second problem is that, during courtship, you are accompanied by the equivalent of a smooth-talking salesperson. A car salesperson will know more about the car than you do and wants to sell it, independently of its quality. Similarly, a courting male may privately be aware of some of his defects but his interest is closure, not candour. </p> <p>The salesperson can also act to conceal defects in the car. If the car is one that gasps and wheezes at high speeds, he can point out that there are roadworks on the motorway today and it would probably be better to avoid it. A male who has managed to survive may have done so by having good genes, or by having poor genes and looking after himself. Ideally you need to take him out and rev up every component, one by one and in combination, to test for defects; but that is an exhausting job in a 60,000-gene life-form. </p> <p>One idea about courtship in life is that it has been shaped during evolution to solve these problems. It allows a fast assessment of gene quality, and in a way that is not open to deception. Indeed it has been shown that courtship works this way in frogs, butterflies, birds, and some bizarre stalk-eyed flies. Evolution has ensured that a male with accurately copied genes can grow the tail, or dance the dance, or sing the song, whereas a male with corrupt genes cannot so well. It is as if you could assess the quality of a car simply by a ritual display in the showroom. For humans, we have no such conclusive experimental evidence - and never can have. But we do have a good hint that the same process goes on in us. It comes from the death rates of single and married people. </p> <p>The evidence was collected in the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries when breeding was mainly done by married couples. Single men are about 1.8 times as likely to die as comparable married men; single women are about 1.5 times as likely to die as comparable married women. Much the same effect has been found in Europe, America, and Asia. In the evidence we have, being single is one of the biggest risk factors in human life. If you look at a list of the big risk factors for human beings, the top ones in the list are being old, being poor, being male and being single. Being single is about as bad as being male, or poor; it is actuarially equivalent to smoking about a pack of cigarettes per day. </p> <p>What is going on? Two things are probably going on. One does not matter here, and it is that marriage itself may improve your health. The other is that health may improve your marriageability. People with poor health are discriminated against in the marriage market, and the class of single people are the unhealthy leftovers. There is a nationalist joke, which is told in many neighbouring countries around the world. I first heard it from a Scot, in England: \"whenever a Scot crosses the border into England, the average intelligence of both countries goes up.\" It looks as if, whenever a single person marries, the average health of both the single and the married class goes down. In so far as there is a genetic component to health the difference between the mortalities of single and married people suggests that bad genes get snubbed in our marriage markets. </p> <p>Life is 4,000 million years old and it has evolved a series of mechanisms to cope with gene copying error. In the beginning there was natural selection, which killed off mutations. By 3,000 million years ago our ancestors had added a set of molecular mechanisms to proof-read and repair their genes. By 2,000 million years ago they had sexual reproduction, rather than cloning, and that revved up the purge of copying mistakes. Maybe 1,000 million years ago our ancestors reached the last stage in the fight against genetic error. By then, they had gender and life evolved the ability to detect gene quality. The purge of bad genes grew more efficient, as a new stage of female quality control was added before each new generation of machines was run off the genetic assembly lines. </p> <p> \u0095 Mark Ridley's new book Mendel's Demon: Gene Justice and the Complexity of Life is published this week by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.</p>",
  "<p>Gambling has such an immoral reputation, it's hardly surprising that online bookmakers and casinos are springing up at a furious rate. </p> <p>The latest Forrester Research figures show that 5% of the UK's population has already visited gambling web sites. Yahoo's <a href=\"http://uk.dir.yahoo.com/ Business_and_Economy/Shopping_and_Services/Gambling/Casinos\" target=\"_new\">directory of web-based gambling</a> lists more than 500 online casinos. The vast majority of these, however, are based in the US and will be unfamiliar to most people in this country. You need to be sure the casino is regulated, the games are honest and your credit card details are safe. </p> <p>So the safest route into online gambling is to pick an established name that you already know and trust. Alternatively, the <a href=\"http://www.0-casino.com\">0-Casino Guide</a> claims to have a comprehensive directory of legal sites that have been checked for trustworthiness. Which is fine, assuming you trust the 0-Casino guide... </p> <p>With most online casinos, you need to download a piece of software in order to play the games and lose your hard-earned cash. Once the software is in place, it provides a much more interesting experience than the internet alone can supply, with flashy graphics and sound that do not take an age to download. The William Hill Casino <a href=\"http://www.williamhillcasino.com\" target=\"_new\">www.williamhillcasino.com</a> will send you a free CD if you don't fancy waiting an hour to download the full version of the software. </p> <p>William Hill runs 25 different casino games, including poker, blackjack, baccarat, roulette, craps and a number of slot machines. The software is very easy to use; perhaps a little too easy, considering the minimum stake of $5 (about \u00a33) and Lady Luck's desertion of me on the blackjack table. To keep you coming back for more, William Hill also offers a free daily Break the Bank game, where you can win $100,000 if you guess the combination to the vault. </p> <p>One of the more interesting facets of an online casino is that it allows you to play unfamiliar games for low stakes, at your own pace. No impatient glares from the dealer, no tut-tutting from fellow players and no free brightly coloured drinks to addle the brain. My blackjack skills have long been a source of concern for my bank manager, but a few minutes of free online practice, trying out different tactics, improved my game immensely. </p> <p>Despite knowing the games, most people have never been inside a casino. Bookmakers, on the other hand, are almost a national institution, with the Grand National turning thousands of otherwise normal folk into avaricious turf pundits. However, many people regard the shops as off-putting, not least because of the cigarette smoke, impenetrable jargon and the lingering stench of financial desperation. </p> <p>The best online bookmakers have solved the first two problems by designing their sites to be friendly, secure and a doddle to use, even for the beginner. The third problem can only be avoided by betting within your means, whether it's online or on the high street. </p> <p> All the big names are now online, including Ladbrokes <a href=\"http://www.ladbrokes.com\" target=\"_new\">www.ladbrokes.com</a> and William Hill. Ladbrokes offers straightforward tax-free betting on most sports, although the site is a little slow and uses decimal odds (such as 2.35), which can be a bit confusing. At the moment, new customers receive a free bet of up to \u00a320 when they make their first wager on the site. William Hill beats this offer by five pounds, using the traditional method of displaying odds (for example, 13/8) and is slightly faster. Another big name to make it online is the Tote, appearing as Totalbet at <a href=\"http://www.totalbet.com\">www.totalbet.com</a>. It's a well-designed site, with plenty of different sports to choose from, but it's not quite as friendly as the other two. </p> <p>If traditional betting doesn't take your fancy, perhaps you should consider spread betting, where the potential winnings - and losses - are dramatically increased. <a href=\"http://www.sportingindex.com\">Sporting Index</a> is the most famous name in spread betting but most of the big bookmakers also offer it. If you want something even less traditional, check out <a href=\"http://www.flutter.com\">www.flutter.com</a>. Flutter is a new concept in organised gambling: it offers you the chance to bet directly against other individuals. To create a bet, you choose the event, set the odds and specify how much you want to wager. If the odds are attractive enough, another punter will take you up on it. </p> <p>Recently, the popularity of Big Brother has been reflected in a massive rise in flutters about Channel 4's hit show. It's fun, simple and the selection of bets ranges from world-shaking events such as the US Presidency race, to the ludicrously banal, such as the hair colour of the Sun's page three girl on a particular day.
