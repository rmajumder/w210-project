  "<p>Most PAs know the sensation that hits you when you realise you simply can't do everything that's on your desk. Even putting in extra hours and cutting corners, you're still not going to deliver it all on time. Hopefully, this is a rare situation, but if you constantly lurch from crisis to missed deadline and back, there's something wrong with your workload. And for the sake of your self-esteem, your reputation at work and your health, you need to find out where the problem lies. </p> <p>\u0095 Take a step back and look at where your work comes from. Is it because all three of your managers expect work at the same time? Or maybe your workload has increased since a colleague left? Perhaps your unreliable office kit means you're losing hours of valuable time looking at a dormant PC? </p> <p>\u0095 When you've hit on the problem areas, talk to someone who can help. That doesn't mean moaning to your colleagues - talk to your boss or the personnel department and give them a written summary of the problem. Don't be emotional and never utter the words, \"I can't cope\". This is merely a business challenge which needs to be resolved, and the fact that you're doing just that shows that you can cope. </p> <p>\u0095 Suggest some solutions - would a temp help to cover a busy time, or could work be delegated elsewhere? Maybe some of those important deadlines are not really so important and could be moved? Would more reliable, up-to-date office equipment pay dividends? </p> <p>\u0095 If you're drowning because your managers refuse to prioritise your work, negotiate with the most approachable of them. Explain calmly that, given the timescales, tasks x, y and z will not all be delivered on time and which would they like first? </p> <p>\u0095 Have a look at your time management, too. Track down your common time-wasters - be they people interrupting, constant shuffling through papers or maybe even your boss - and resolve to deal with them. Plan your days realistically and schedule in extra time for interruptions. Keep looking ahead, too. It's no good being surprised that those three days at a conference destroy your week's work plan. You should have seen that coming. </p> <p>\u0095 And finally, don't panic. Think who your boss is more likely to respond to - someone who keeps repeating \"I can't cope\" and has no solutions to offer? Or the calm explanations and suggestions of a PA in control - even if it's faked?</p> <p>\u0095 Penny Cottee is editor of Executive PA magazine.</p>",
  "<p>Last Saturday would have been the late conductor Sir Georg Solti's 88th birthday, and the BBC Philharmonic's programme was intended as a tribute to his towering contribution to the reputation of Wagner in Britain. It included the rarely heard concert suite from G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, which, as with the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan, was compiled by Wagner himself in an attempt to reach as wide an audience as possible. </p> <p>The strategy worked well enough; Nietzsche was won over after hearing these excerpts in the concert hall, and it is not difficult to see why. The compression of hours' worth of music into half-hour chunks works so well that the listener could easily feel guilty: it's all the pleasure without the pain. </p> <p>Such guilt may have been somewhat assuaged by Downes's remarkable restraint in his conducting of the overtly theatrical overture to the Flying Dutchman. Disappointing as this may have been for some, any urge to reach for the volume control must have been mitigated by the conviction of the playing. </p> <p>The Siegfried Idyll, Wagner's radiant birthday offering to his wife, received a comparably understated performance. This was Wagner at his most tender; no sudden passionate surging ruffled the gentle lyricism, while Downes's almost classical approach to phrasing allowed space for the overall structure to breathe. </p> <p>Overall structure is perhaps something we tend not to listen for in performances of the Tristan prelude; here, absence of the familiar sense of urgency and short-breathed string phrasing produced a quite distinctive Tristan tone, almost more reflective than yearning. The young Swedish soprano Irene Theorin responded sensitively to Downes; although the final, long-awaited climax swamped her for a few moments she showed no sign of strain. </p> <p>Wagner's selection of interludes from G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung seamlessly weaves together Dawn and Siegfried's Rhine journey from act one with his funeral music and the closing immolation scene. In this last Theorin was a passionate Br\u00fcnnhilde, while Downes allowed the orchestral sound to broaden and open out. The final moments, as Valhalla is consumed by flames, were shattering and glorious. </p>",
  "<p>How many lies did you tell in your job-hunting today? Did you excise the kids from your CV, add or remove a husband, shave 10 years from your age, or put five on for that company who wanted someone \"mature and experienced\"? </p> <p>Manchester United has just appointed a new director of communications, Paddy Haverson, whose background in PR and sports journalism the club must surely hope will mask the embarrassment surrounding the departure of his predecessor. Alison Ryan was fired from the post before she had stepped into the office after it was revealed that she had kept off her CV the fact that she had been banned from practising law - a punishment imposed after she had falsely claimed to have a first class degree from Cambridge. More worryingly, a lecturer who last week was cleared of raping a student at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside will be sentenced next month for obtaining his job by deception. Russell Griffiths had not disclosed his previous convictions for harassing women. </p> <p>All employers could tell Manchester United that CVs contain lies, and that the real skill is to spot the ones that matter. Even massive fibs, it seems, don't necessarily mean the worst. Martin Abramson, chairman of import-exporters Brennan Atkinson, confesses to having been in a rush the day he took on a dyslexic PA and an office manager who assured him that complex export paperwork would be \"no problem\" - even though she had never done it before. </p> <p>\"My business went through absolute hell for three months. It was six weeks before I discovered the secretary was dyslexic - then I found she was such a good trader that she became MD of one of my companies. The export clerk pleaded with me to be patient, and now she's my operations director. </p> <p>\"Neither of them actually told a bare-faced lie, but CVs can be misleading, and if someone's sent along for a secretarial job, you don't usually ask if she's dyslexic. I should have spoken to the previous employers, but the agency is supposed to have done that. It shows you can't judge what's on paper.\" </p> <p>Commercially-prepared CVs have been derided as \"put-together papers by people who don't know who they're writing about, and don't know who they're writing to\", but, the professional CV writers protest, they are now so used to being asked to exaggerate that they grill their clients automatically. And, says Michelle Atkinson of Impact CV, checking-up is getting very sophisticated. She cites a finance-checking company which has turned, profitably, into a qualification-checking service. </p> <p>Although she has spotted all the classic lies, such as those who \"went to Oxford\", but not to the university, Atkinson is sympathetic. \"The most common lie is date-changing and age-changing. I know one client who has lived for twenty years in fear of his CV being exposed.\" </p> <p>But lies may lead to more than dismissal, warns CV-writer Chris Christensen of A Write Impression. \"Very few people can pull it off - and if they are found out after being paid a sign-on bonus, they might be forced to return it. It might be considered fraud.\" </p> <p>Elizabeth Henry of Leeds law firm Last Cawthra Feather says a lying applicant could end up in court. \"The employer might be entitled to sue for salary paid, the cost of training and any other monies expended - for example, recruitment fees.\" </p> <p>The longer a career goes on, however, the more an employer is interested in experience over grades, and Henry agrees that time offers a defence. \"To justify instant dismissal, the lie must amount to gross misconduct. If it is a matter of higher grades having been quoted in respect of qualifications obtained years before, then it may not be reasonable to dismiss summarily. The employer would have to allow the employee an opportunity to explain - and for not doing so, the employer could possibly be taken to an employment tribunal.\" </p> <p>Errors do happen, as in the CV which boasted \"I was instrumental in ruining an entire operation\". The best course in composing a resume is simply careful phrasing. </p> <p>Kauser Kanji, co-founder of i-resign.com, points out that prisoners' associations recommend that time inside be described as \"not in work\", which is technically correct. And subjective statements such as \"I'm a team player\", or \"I'm a hard worker\" are opinions, and legally unchallengable. </p> <p>But candidates can be too honest, warns Paul King of Achiever Career Development. \"I cringe at the number of CVs which invite discrimination. The most common mistakes are in 'marital status' and 'religion' - a client of some standing in a particular religious denomination said so at length in his CV. We revised it to 'active in the community', which took no risks. It is just as important to leave out material which may be used as an excuse to reject you.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Catholics of Ulster</strong><br>Marianne Elliott<br>Penguin \u00a325, pp688<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000240371,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p><strong>Wherever Green is Worn</strong><br>Tim Pat Coogan<br>Hutchinson \u00a325, pp757<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502298237,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Buried in the careful research that Marianne Elliott has put into <strong> The Catholics of Ulster</strong>, there are nuggets of emotion. Writing the book has involved painful recognition of the prejudices she grew up with in Belfast and had not yet shed in 25 years in England. She is professor of modern history and director of the Institute of Irish Studies at Liverpool University. </p> <p>As far as this forceful book is concerned, recognition of the distinctiveness of Ulster Catholics, and even the difference between Catholics living in the east and west within Northern Ireland, is crucial to political progress. 'I have always felt different from Catholics elsewhere in Ireland and this is a common feeling among Ulster Catholics. Yet I have found them consistently neglected in the histories of Ireland and of Irish Catholicism in particular, as if Irishness and Catholicism so dominated their sense of themselves that they could be safely included with all other Irish Catholics... if that had been so, we would not have been left with that overwhelming sense of insecurity which is such a feature of the Ulster personality.' </p> <p>The scarring of the psyche has influenced Ulster's Catholics - Professor Elliott reclaims the old Irish kingdom name, 'Ulster', recognising the political sensitivity since Unionists use it for six-county Northern Ireland - and deepened their innate conservatism in their response to the Irish state, to their church and to segregated education. </p> <p>Her history shows the distinctiveness pre-dating partition in 1921 and rooted in early migrations and alliances. She recognises the horrors of the potato famines, but points to complexities beyond the demonology. By implication, even if only as cousins, northern Catholics are different from most Catholics who regard their Irish extraction as crucial to their make-up, particularly those in the United States. </p> <p>This is the nub of the difference between Elliott and the author of a second book on Catholics from Ireland, the journalist-turned-historian, Tim Pat Coogan, whose <strong> Wherever Green is Worn</strong> is a rollicking trawl looking at the fate of migrants, including those during the potato famines. Important among their descendants are the influential Irish-Americans affecting US involvement in the peace process. What Coogan very definitely does not do is identify Northern Ireland Catholics as different. </p> <p>Coogan, who has written two serious biographies, of Michael Collins and of Eamon De Valera, as well as a history of the IRA, trawls from the US via Britain to Japan looking at the Orange and Green tensions. His stock-in-trade is the hard-done-by, hard-drinking Irish Catholic and the patronising British colonial. Stereotypes last, he says, if they are founded in truth. </p> <p>The two authors are both deeply critical of the Catholic Church, Elliott for its political dealings in Northern Ireland, Coogan for its failure to care for the migrants. Coogan is outspoken in his criticism of the Dublin and London governments, although inevitably the British get more stick. </p> <p>Both authors recognise that the fact the Catholics are growing as a proportion of the population of Northern Ireland is vital, but here they divide. Elliott, whose family still lives in north Belfast, recalls rioting by loyalists that followed a mistaken report in 1991 that Catholics would shortly outnumber Protestants. Every word of her book is tempered to warn against triumphalism. </p> <p>Coogan, who refers to his own emotional background as a little boy watching the pathetic parade of migrants through Dun Laoghaoire, also worries about the effect of Catholic expansion in numbers and wealth on the Protestant psyche, but he cannot resist an epilogue saying: 'One day the sheer energy of the Celts... will subsume the present Unionist majority.' </p> <p>Coogan's book, woven throughout though it is with fascinating nuggets, falls on that sentence. Sadly, with its sexy cover showing migrants crowding under the White Star sign and its clear spin for a US readership, it is the one that will influence before Elliott's equally readable work. Her elegant grey cover says 'serious reader'. The less serious should not be put off.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Hill Bachelors</strong><br>William Trevor<br>Viking \u00a315.99, pp256<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000240122,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> These are stories that bear the imprint of habit. They tell of lives casually undone by predictable circumstance and they do so with a grace and a rhythm so long taken to heart that it seems second nature. </p> <p>The title story is typical. On the death of his father, a hill farmer, the youngest of three sons, returns to the bleak fields of his childhood. He comes back, the only unmarried son in the family, to be by his mother's side, and in the pressing knowledge that his life, which had promised something in the town, will now also be lived on this hillside. </p> <p>As he reclaims his father's fields from the bog, yard by yard, his inheritance closes in on him in inexorable detail - 'He naturally would know that times were bad, neither sheep nor cattle fetching what they were a year ago, everything gone quiet, the way you'd never have believed it' - until he is himself reclaimed by his fate. </p> <p>This story, in common with nearly all the stories in this word-perfect collection, takes two people and examines the connections and the dislocations between them, the ways in which ordinary lives are quietly shaped by chance and missed opportunity. </p> <p>Trevor is a great dissector of intimacy and here he turns the same sharp, humane attention in one tale to Vera and Sidney, bound in an unconsummated 30-year love by a grim secret buried in their past, and in another to the odd congress between a young man and a woman who meet for the first and last time in a restaurant. The woman's husband has fallen down drunk and the young man assists her in carrying him back to her bedroom. </p> <p>Trevor long ago staked his imagination's claim to dual nationality: his fiction commutes between the blustery lives of rural Ireland, the places of his childhood, and the stiffer formality of small-town England, his adoptive home. </p> <p>But while Trevor's territory remains constant, his understanding of the unravelling of relationships in these places, by these places, is being constantly refined. </p> <p>Where there is humour, as in 'Death of a Professor', which is a high-table tale of a man whose obituary appears prematurely in the papers, and who finds his life's work squashed between larger notices about a 'backing singer in a pop group and a bishop, born in Stockport', then it invariably bleaches into something more poignant. </p> <p>The most remarkable of these stories, 'The Telephone Game', works as a metaphor for Trevor's quiet, affecting vision. On the night before their wedding, a young couple - she German, he English - embark on a game involving calling strangers, playing tricks. The man, for a laugh, sends an elderly woman he doesn't know up into her attic to check her water tank, having warned her of floods. She fails to return, and in the silence on the end of the line the couple suddenly hear all their fears about their impending life together crackling. </p> <p>For all the cosy-seeming certainties on the surface of his prose, this kind of echoing emptiness is never far from the lives of the people William Trevor creates. </p> <p>They sometimes seem contented, but mostly they are, like this couple, left to wonder about the lives of others, hoping against hope for the 'far-off rattle of a human voice, faint and small.'</p>",
  "<p>Jim McLean's ignominious departure from Dundee United, charged with assault on a BBC Television reporter, was the seemingly inevitable result of a career spent failing to distinguish between life as he would like it to be and the real thing. </p> <p>At 63, the club's former manager, chairman and managing director may have been considered by many to have long since passed the stage where a bad temper could lead him into possible prosecution. But such an assumption would betray an ignorance of McLean's reality-obscuring tempestuousness. </p> <p>Those of us who have been familiar with his modus operandi through almost three decades as manager, director and, ultimately, chairman and major shareholder at Dundee United were not as surprised as those shocked TV viewers watching the incident. His alleged assault on reporter John Barnes, following verbal abuse at the end of an interview in which he seemed to become agitated at being asked about the appointment of his brother, Tommy, as coach and about the future of the manager, Alex Smith, came a few years after he had been accused of a similar loss of temper involving a BBC cameraman at Edinburgh Airport. </p> <p>The latest episode ended with Barnes being treated by the United club doctor for a cut and badly swollen lip and an on-the-spot apology from Doug Smith, the vice-chairman. The following day, McLean himself made a public apology to Barnes. By then he had resigned, although he remains the owner of 41 per cent of the club's equity. He has resolved to sell his shareholding to complete the severance. </p> <p>Curiously, many professional commentators discovered 'sadness' in the manner of McLean's departure, recalling his outstanding success is transforming Dundee United from and old-time Scottish Second Division team into one capable of winning the championship and reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup as well as the Uefa Cup final. </p> <p>McLean's achievements were undeniable, but the many who could claim to have been victims of his ruthlessness since his appointment at the end of 1971 would find it difficult to muster so much as a pinhead of pity. </p> <p>McLean, a lifelong non-smoking teetotaller, was born into a Plymouth Brethren family in Lanarkshire, whose religious fundamentalism may have contributed to his own tendency towards a kind of vengeance that was pure Old Testament. Insults and injustices may have been real or imagined, but they were invariably magnified to the point where they could only be met with controlled retaliation. </p> <p>These were no heat-of-the-moment altercations. Rather they were the result of McLean's clincial planning. Most of this was possible in the days when clubs had unbreakable control over players' contracts and insurrectionists could be deprived of their livelihood unless they conformed. For example, a few years back, one foreign player was involved in a vendetta that lasted so long that the rest of the United squad on more than one occasion had a whip-round so their clubmate could buy food. On another occasion, a promising young player's bad experience at the club reached the ears of his father, who arrived at the door of McLean's office one day, barged in and exacted physical retribution. </p> <p>Another player became embroiled in the manager's rule about where players should live - many clubs have similar criteria. In this case, McLean insisted his players should live within a 30-mile radius of Dundee. </p> <p>The player had a home he loved in Glenrothes, in Fife. He argued that he was 29 miles from Dundee. He related later his incredulity when McLean climbed into his car and drove to the player's home, announcing tri umphantly that the distance was exactly 30.1 miles. The player had to move house. </p> <p>Allowed this kind of autocratic totalitarianism by a feudal, anachronistic contract system, it was hardly surprising that McLean should encounter insurmountable difficulties in handling the great changes which have transformed the business of football in the past decade. </p> <p>As his team under a succession of different managers have slithered into decline on the field and the financial soundness of the club has been disrupted, McLean has been besieged in recent years by United For Change, the fans' pressure group seeking his removal, the disposal of his stock, and the release of 13,000 shares which have remained unissued for years, effectively helping to strengthen Mclean's power base. </p> <p>All of their objectives are now likely to be achieved, ironically through the misadventures of their target rather than their own actions. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>The Football Association has become vastly more publicity conscious over the past 10 years, no longer blinking under unwanted spotlights but positively enjoying the interregnums between England managers when they become the focus of attention. </p> <p>In the process they have become much slicker. Last week they managed to rule out the 'people's choice' - or at least the candidate half the nation's back pages have been promoting since Kevin Keegan's departure - without even mentioning Terry Venables' name. </p> <p>Howard Wilkinson too has been ever-so-gently shafted, first by his deliberate inclusion on the committee set up to find the next manager, then by the pointed reference in the newly adopted criteria to 'ability to inspire a team'. </p> <p>It is easy to imagine every manager in the country except one having a good laugh on reading that. Next England manager must have the ability to inspire a team. Whatever next? Own tracksuit an advantage? Familiarity with offside rule essential? It might have been kinder just to stipulate the next man's initials must not be HW or that applicants from Yorkshire need not bother. For now Wilkinson not only knows he won't get the job, he knows exactly why he is not wanted. </p> <p>Lazio's Anglophile manager Sven-Goran Eriksson appears to be the man the FA do want - the appointment of a caretaker this week notwithstanding - though naturally no one is saying so at this stage. If you look closely at the seven-man committee's criteria, the two managers who spring immediately to mind, apart from the Swede, are Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson. These are the two the FA are believed to have been most keen on from day one, but the last thing they want is to be seen to be desperate. </p> <p>Putting all their effort into a siege of Highbury or Old Trafford, only to receive the most public rebuff when a manager opts to stay with his club, is so 20th century. Much better just to let your man know he is wanted then keep your distance. It might not succeed, but at least you aren't embarrassed and the eventual manager does not know he was third or fourth choice. </p> <p>So when the FA let it be known they would love to consider Ferguson, but don't see any point in pursuing him because he intends to retire, it may not be the end of the matter. All Ferguson has to do now is indicate there are some challenges that would persuade him to postpone his retirement, and business could result. There is still the obstacle of his being a proud Scot to overcome, but how much prouder could a Scot get than being asked to rescue English football? </p> <p>More or less the same applies to Wenger, though it is difficult to see too many other coaches matching to the FA's superhuman criteria. The assumption seems to be that since England have not won anything for 34 years, and since the job has taken a visible toll on most of the incumbents since 1966, the new man must be at the very peak of his profession with the medals to prove it. </p> <p>Yet there is evidence from all over the world that club success does not always translate onto the international stage. From a managerial point of view the two jobs are totally different, and many countries see nothing wrong in appointing relative unknowns as national coaches. Mighty Brazil have just appointed such a manager; Emerson Leao would not fulfil any of the FA's criteria for achievement or integrity, as in a modest club career the only reputation he has acquired has been for the thuggish nature of his teams. </p> <p>None of the French World Cup winning triumvirate of Aime Jacquet, Gerard Houllier and Roger Lemerre got their jobs by carrying off the major European prizes; and Humberto Coelho, who took Portugal in some style to within a golden goal penalty of the final of Euro 2000, had no club background whatsoever before taking over the national side and has since disappeared back into obscurity. </p> <p>It appears that the best sides are still the ones with the best players. If you have a generation of talent like France, or outstanding individuals like Portugal, the guy in charge does not necessarily have to be the most decorated or well-travelled manager around. He just has to be a proficient coach. There is no reason why England should not go out and get the best man they can find, but they will be getting a football coach, not an alchemist. </p> <p>It is unrealistic to expect miracles until England begin producing more players. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Stretching away into a 12-point lead over Rangers in the championship would warm Celtic fans more thoroughly than the manner of its achievement. Another patchy, workmanlike performance on a day when a massacre of the league's bottom club had been anticipated was rescued by the goals from Henrik Larsson and Alan Thompson - the latter becoming a handy contributor - which preceded the aberration which brought Paul Lambert an unwanted credit as Dundee United's scorer. </p> <p>But expectations of landslide victories are rarely fulfilled, especially when the nominated victims are fighting for survival. On these occasions, fear lends strength to their endeavours, leading to the kind of resolute resistance which creates seemingly interminable periods of stalemate. </p> <p>United showed that they would not be easily subdued, demonstrating a commitment to the cause which amounted to a virtual guarantee that Celtic would have little room in which to manoeuvre. </p> <p>By the time Larsson scored, the legions in the stands were consciously raising short-lived chants, as if realising that their own anxiety had become palpable, likely to be transmitted to the players. Thompson's supplementary effort in the second half dispelled the fretfulness. </p> <p>They could hardly be criticised for their lengthy, watchful silences, the league leaders having induced in them an apprehension which could be relieved only by a tangible sign of superiority. Territorial advantage really had to be accompanied by at least one goal. </p> <p>Larsson, despite looking relatively pedestrian - at times even uncharacteristically disoriented - could have scored five minutes before he gave the home side the lead, but sent his header against Alan Combe's right post after stooping to meet Thompson's corner. </p> <p>Larsson's goal also came from a set piece, this time a corner on the left, which Petrov played short to Thompson, who teed it up for the Bulgarian. His centre found Larsson diving into space to bullet the header past Combe from six yards. </p> <p>With their defence policy violated, United resorted to the contingency plan, clearly based on making quick headway towards Gould whenever a break in the pressure occurred. Predictably, they managed to create some alarm in the Celtic defence, which, with only Tom Boyd, Johan Mjallby and Joos Valgaeren patrolling the area, tended to be strung out by the Parkhead side's own emphasis on attack. </p> <p>On one sortie, Jonathan Gould was required to make a very handy save from Craig Easton, diving right at full stretch to push away a powerful low drive from the Scotland under-21 midfielder which would have brought the equaliser but for the goalkeeper's intervention. </p> <p>But John Licina clearly believed he had provided the goal with the last action of the first half, meeting a corner kick from the right and directing an intelligent header past Gould. It was stopped by Bobby Petta and, ultimately, gathered into the arms of Gould, but Licina made the kind of prolonged appeal to the referee which suggested he believed the ball had crossed the line. </p> <p>Thompson's goal would be met with raucous acclaim not only for its meaningfulness, but because it was so attractively constructed and sweetly executed during a match that had become rather bland. Lambert began the mischief by sliding the ball short to Mjallby and the big defender's cross from the right was high and looping. Chris Sutton, almost invariably the master in these situations, won the aerial joust with Jason de Vos and nodded the ball into the path of Thompson, whose beautifully-controlled, low, right-foot drive skidded at pace to the left of Combe and into the corner of the net. </p> <p>The goal which brought United previously unsuspected encouragement could hardly have been more different. A seemingly harmless cross from the left fell to John McQuillan, but he was easily dispossessed as he tried to control the ball and take aim at Gould's net. Lambert, coming across to complete the clearance, simply lashed the ball into his own net from six yards. </p> <p>If the scoreline looked distorted, it should still serve to encourage a United side still seeking their first league victory of a tortured season. There was evidence enough through the 90 minutes of their desire and resilience. A sprinkling of good fortune seems overdue. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>It'ss tight at the top. They had to delay the kick-off for a quarter of an hour to cram everyone into Saltergate yesterday and, considering the length of these teams' unbeaten runs, perhaps it was no surprise that it took Chesterfield until the 91st minute before they finally broke Brighton's resolve to extend their lead at the top of the Third Division. </p> <p>Brighton, losing for the first time in 11 games, survived for 40 second-half minutes with ten men after Charlie Oatway, on Fifa's fair play day, was sent off. But then Ryan Williams, Chesterfield's chief creator, dribbled his way to the byline and crossed to the far post where substitute Jamie Ingledow, only on for the final nine minutes, crashed in the winning header. </p> <p>Chesterfield have plans to move to the greyhound stadium while Brighton are already playing at their local athletics venue. But neither is going to the dogs; both certainly appear right on track. </p> <p>The first half was a tightly-contested affair, epitomised by a challenge eight minutes before the break when the ball was fortunate to come out left with any air in it. Ryan Williams, Chesterfield's busy winger, and Oatway, one of Brighton's skin-headed hard men, went in completely fairly on that occasion. But when they rumbled in stoppage time, the tension spilled over. All but three player rushed in to give their version of events which ended with Oatway being booked. But it was Brighton who edged the first period, eight-goal Bobby Zamora swivelling on to a loose ball after eight minutes to shoot wide. </p> <p>Unfortunately Oatway could not dim his combative-ness and six minutes after the break, as Sean Parrish broke clear of him in the centre circle, the Brighton midfielder clipped his opponent's heels. </p> <p>Both clubs have known how it feels to prop up a division, Chesterfield having finished bottom of the Second Division last May while Brighton, three times in five seasons, finished in penultimate spot. This year however, things have been looking up. </p> <p>Ambition has been reflected in investment. No club in the basement division has outlaid more than the \u00a3150,000 Chesterfield spent on Luke Beckett, missing with a thigh injury yesterday, who scored 19 goals for doomed Chester City. </p> <p>But expectation was also high for Mickey Adams' team this season, after they finished last term unbeaten in 14 games, though this season started off at a trundle before this long unbeaten run. The first goal they had conceded in ten hours was even credited to their own goalkeeper, on Wednesday, when Michel Kuipers fumbled a Hartlepool cross over his own line. </p> <p>Chesterfield meanwhile, under the guidance of former captain Nicky Law, immortalised at Saltergate for leading the team to Wembley triumph five years ago in the Third Division play-off final against Bury, have exceeded hopes. They had won six games on the bounce before two draws culminated in a 2-2 share at Rochdale on Tuesday. </p> <p>But Chesterfield, despite being pinned back in their own half for much of the early action yesterday, at least held their own in the first period. They tore into Brighton and were unfortunate when Marcus Ebdon, with 20 minutes remaining, collected the ball off David Reeves, composed himself and curled a shot towards the top corner only for Kuipers to save in spectacular fashion. Brighton defended with resolve but after 84 minutes were again grateful for their reserve goalkeeper when Kuipers tipped Ebdon's 25-yard volley aside.</p>",
  "As I scrambled through the mud towards the refugee camp, the sounds and scents overwhelmed me. I could hear logs being chopped, children playing, pigs squealing, cockerels squawking, and could smell the woodsmoke and the wet jungle. Memories came flooding back and I found myself terribly anxious. <p>Would people remember me? Would they be happy to see me? But my welcome at the camp in Thailand, near the Burmese border, could not have been warmer. Many of the students I had taught English now had children. One was named after me, born while I was in jail. 'Gold Rachel' was delightful and, unlike most Karenni babies, didn't scream at the sight of a white face. </p> <p>And then there were the new arrivals, with terrible tales of persecution and suffering. They had been living in the jungle for several years, having fled the relocation decreed in the Nineties by Burma's military dictatorship, one called 'Slorc' and now known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). </p> <p>Their individual stories formed a picture of genocide. In the jungle they had to move five or six times a year, and slept without a roof over them. Their hiding place was discovered when their fifth child had just been born. Samuel is a skinny, unusually tall Karenni. 'The placenta hadn't even come out yet. I was terribly worried about my wife, I carried her through the streams as I was afraid about her walking through the cold water. But when we got to the border I couldn't carry her as we had to walk in the stream a long way. Now she gets migraines all the time.' The family walked for three weeks. They had to evade not just troops but mines and had to rely for guidance either on hired guides or resistance army soldiers. </p> <p>The Karenni are among the many persecuted ethnic minorities in Burma. Those that have no ceasefire agreement with the dictatorship have had their areas declared free-fire zones. Human rights abuses are rampant and hundreds of villagers victimised in an attempt to turn them against the resistance. The so-called 'Four Cuts' campaign tries to stop food, recruits, information and money reaching the resistance armies. </p> <p>Forced relocation began in 1974 in Karen and Chin State. In 1996 the scale of relocations increased dramatically, with 25,000 people forced into 'relocation centres' within Karenni State: roughly one eighth of the Karenni people torn from their ancestral lands in 12 months. </p> <p>Many areas of Karenni State, as well as other parts of Burma, have been cleared: 30,000 people used to live in an area approximately 100 miles by 30 miles in eastern Karenni, now it is completely depopulated. Escapees described to me the appalling conditions in relocation sites. There was no access to clean water, no land to cultivate, no materials for housing. Troops were everywhere. </p> <p>The old villages were burnt down and the remains mined to stop people returning, animals were slaughtered, and those determined to stay in their homes were burnt alive. Torture, beating and arbitrary execution accompany the SPDC soldiers wherever they go. </p> <p>When Paw Moo, now in her thirties, decided to go to a relocation camp, they had five days to vacate their own village four kilometres away. They had to do forced labour at the military base. </p> <p>She said: 'About six months ago the soldiers called all the villagers together, and arrested all the men. They took some as forced porters and others to Loikaw - the capital of Karenni State. Some managed to escape, others were put in jail, about 20 men disappeared. My husband hid in the jungle, many men did. After they arrested the men, they called the women together and said \"if we hear gun shots or that rebel groups are in the area, then we will kill you\".' When she and her family made the treacherous journey to Thailand, many of the men were still in jail. </p> <p>Sonny, from the same village as Paw Moo, confirms her story. 'The SPDC arrested 32 men and one woman because of fighting near the border. The resistance troops came near to our village, but they didn't come in or get food.' </p> <p>As we sat in the early-morning mist, Mee Reh told me his painful story. He was a subsistence farmer relocated from a village called Wha Lo. 'In 1995 the SPDC burnt down our village. Some people were killed, we ran away.' The years of sleepless nights and desperate poverty were written on his face. His youngest child, now two but the still the size of a six-month-old baby, will never fully develop, physically or mentally. </p> <p>They dodged troops, hiding in the jungle or in a cave. Often the sound of shooting kept them awake all night. They drank rice water and ate bamboo shoots. Because of malnutrition a child died. 'I became very depressed.' </p> <p>Mee Reh's wife breastfeeds her underdeveloped child. His infant features sit uncomfortably on his baby-sized face. She describes the story of her cousin's family, also in hiding, camped on the riverbank. They were hit by a flash flood. </p> <p>'All the children and Htoo La Paw were washed away, but two children were thrown to safety on the land. Htoo La Paw was badly injured. Later they found the elder girl under a log, her feet were sticking out from the freshly deposited sand and mud. They dug out her body, her head was crushed. The youngest daughter they found hanging in the bushes, dead, after the flood receded. They have been internally displaced people for five years, and want to come here. Everything they had was washed away, so they have no money to pay for a guide, or to be able to buy food on the way.' </p> <p>Mee Reh's wife reflects on how lucky they are that her eldest child is attending school. The village school in Wha Lo was closed by the SPDC before the village was burnt down, and there are no schools in the jungle for those in hiding. </p> <p>Villagers are forced to work without payment on government 'development projects' like building roads and barracks, farm clearance and cultivation. </p> <p>Mary was only 19 years old. She had been forced to work for the soldiers 20 days per month, mainly in digging and building projects. She was terrified, particularly after two women in her village were raped by soldiers. They asked her father, an old man, to fetch bamboo and beat him with their gun butts. They had to leave him behind because he was too old and frail to walk. Mary was clearly depressed by her feelings of helplessness. 'I'm not happy here, but I feel better than in my village. Our life is just waiting and eating donated rice.' </p> <p>For villagers asked to carry arms and supplies, it was a terrifying prospect. Tired porters are beaten or killed. Many of them never return. One escaped porter showed me the scars on his shoulders from the tremendous weight he was forced to carry. Porters are often marched in front of advancing battalions as human minesweepers. Gang rape of women porters is common. </p> <p>Bor Reh was forced to be the village headman, as he was the only person who could speak Burmese, and so translate the labour demands of the SPDC to the locals. The village head was once a pres tigious post to hold, now it is a responsibility better avoided. </p> <p>The SPDC's General Aung Gyi, head of Light Infantry Battalion Number 54 operating in this area, is infamous for his cruelty in punishing villagers, and for administering the punishments personally. Brutality against ethnic minorities is commonplace. Regular taxes, in the form of money and rice, are collected by SPDC troops, who also demand free food and alcohol when passing through the village. Curfews are often imposed. </p> <p>Deforestation, initially from low-impact logging by the Karenni but now widescale by the SPDC, has led to decreasing rainfall, which also has had impacts on rice yields. All these compound major food shortages for even those who still have land. </p> <p>Kyaw Te's trembling hands spoke of his life of fear in hiding. 'When we stayed there we were afraid all the time. The Burmese government, they want to destroy our people, to kill us all off.' </p> <p>The refugee camp is an increasingly insecure haven. Thailand's attitude to the ethnic minorities is changeable. Previously considered as a necessary buffer zone between Thailand and its aggressive neighbour, Burma, the resistance forces and the asylum-seekers are now deemed a nuisance in the growing closeness between the two nations. </p> <p>Hundreds of asylum-seekers have been forcibly repatriated, and new arrivals find it increasingly difficult to enter. Thailand and Burma have brokered a number of huge cross-border projects, fostering closer relations through economic ties. Two major gas pipeline projects, Yadana and Yetagun, including Total (France) and Premier Oil (Britain), are already complete and functional in an area south of Karenni State. </p> <p>Their impact on the local area has been devastating. There are plans afoot to dam and divert the Salween river that flows through Karenni State, feeding it into Thai waterways and starving three million people in downstream Burma of water. Among them are the Karenni. </p> <p>Last year I went to Burma to make a solidarity action for the many peoples of Burma. It was a simple act of defiance: to sing songs about democracy and freedom. The military response was rapid. I was arrested within 13 minutes. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www3.itu.int/MISSIONS/Myanmar/\" target=\"_NEW\"> Official statements from Myanmar regime</a><br> <a href=\"http://&lt;A HREF=\" http: www.freeburma.org \" target=\"_NEW\">Independent information and news</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org\" target=\"_NEW\"> Amnesty International human rights charity</a></p>",
  "<p>In Wonder Boys, Grady Tripp, the middle-aged novelist played by Michael Douglas, has got a problem. The inkwell of inspiration has run dry. He hasn't published anything in seven years since his last book, an acclaimed bestseller. There is an all too obvious comparison to be made with Curtis Hanson, the middle-aged director of Wonder Boys: the curse of the onerous follow-up. </p> <p>Until the release of his last film Hanson was not a critics' darling, but a well-regarded journeyman, best known as the director-for-hire of hit thrillers, The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and The River Wild. Then in 1997, after 20 years of hurt and humbling experiences in Hollywood, he finally got to make the film he wanted. The result was L.A. Confidential, the glorious neo-noir thriller adapted from James Ellroy's labyrinthine novel. Conventional wisdom suggested it was too dense for the screen; not so, the tour-de-force was one of the shining films of the Nineties. Critics universally hailed it the best thriller since Chinatown, perhaps even better. Suddenly Hanson was on the A-list. </p> <p>So how do you follow that up? Obviously the weight of expectation has not unduly burdened the shoulders of this slim, 55-year-old dressed head to toe in black. 'I had been in this business trying so hard for so long, rather than paralysis me with fear it did the opposite,' he explains in measured tones. 'It actually liberated me. I used that success to make the kind of movie I had always wanted to do before.' </p> <p>His response, Wonder Boys, adapted from Michael Chabon's novel, is a work of obvious assurance. The pleasure is in the pacing and the details. It's an offbeat, languid and dark comedy set in a wintry Pittsburgh campus during a literary festival. Douglas is the slowly unravelling Tripp, an English professor and author of The Arsonist's Daughter, the literary sensation that sealed his reputation. </p> <p>The movie follows him over the course of what turns out to be a lost weekend, starting inauspiciously for him when his wife walks out. Douglas heads the cast although this is an ensemble piece with a fine cast. Robert Downey Jr is Tripp's desperate agent, Tobey Maguire, the freakish, introverted star pupil, Frances McDormand, his mistress and Katie Holmes, his seductive student lodger. </p> <p>The bizarre parade of events in Wonder Boys would make the plot read like a screwball comedy. Accidental shootings, illicit trysts and zany misunderstandings are de regueur. But it was the characters that attracted Hanson. 'Michael Chabon presents these characters to us in a completely non-judgemental way. I liked the fact that there was an absence of attitude from the storyteller's point of view.' Likewise with L.A. Confidential, which he does not consider to be a noir film, Hanson was really interested in the ambiguous cops. 'I wanted to tell the story of the case but what really interested me was the emotional life of the cops. I was intrigued by them the same way I was about Wonder Boys - the difference is here they made me laugh.' </p> <p> Hanson sees himself as an actors' director. Working with them is his favourite part of the process. He persuaded Meryl Streep to get buff and ride the rapids in The River Wild. He later coaxed an unanticipated Oscar-winning performance from Kim Banister in L.A. Confidential. Simultaneously he persuaded Warner Bros. to hire two relative unknown Australian actors, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, for the leading roles. </p> <p>It's a measure of Hanson's post- L.A. Confidential status that while the convincing executives to back the unconventional project proved tricky, the cast happily signed on. 'Actors don't necessarily care, thank God, how well certain things do at the box office. But they care how the performances look and after L.A. Confidential actors started to want to work with me,' he says. Douglas took a hefty paycut to play the pot-smoking campus romantic who grows steadily more tousled with each passing frame. </p> <p>Seeing Michael Douglas flirt with Middle American mores is nothing new, but here he is stripped of his movie star sheen. But his apparent lack of vanity is appealing and why, one suspects, he leaped at the chance. </p> <p> Wonder Boys wasn't a success with American audiences when released earlier this year. Despite strong reviews, the movie failed to open at the box-office and in an unusual move was swiftly pulled from all cinemas. The studio hadn't lost faith; this was damage limitation. It will get a second chance in the States next month in competition with the award season's other contenders. </p> <p>The release and marketing cock-up clearly rankles. Hanson gives a detailed account of the dispute with the studio over selling Wonder Boys. It was, he concedes, a tough sell, but that's their job. The low point was the misleading poster; a profile shot of a smirking, self-satisfied Douglas that 'looked like he was trying to be Robin Williams'. He can't think of an adjective kind enough to describe the marketing campaign. </p> <p>In 1993 when The Hand That Rock The Cradle, a low-budget, two-dimensional suspense emerged as an unexpected blockbuster he was entrusted to make L.A. Confidential. A couple of years after his 50th birthday, Hanson's serious directing career began. So what took him so long? 'I've always been interested in going my own way. It may not have appeared that way but I've always been picky in what I've done. That's why I haven't done more movies,' he says. (He has directed only 10) 'I did those that appealed to me the most.' </p> <p>But surely there is a big difference between The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and L.A. Confidential? 'My last two films were labours of love in the sense that I had control from start to finish. There were still battles, but both times I won the important battles as opposed to losing them,' he says. </p> <p>The son of Los Angeles schoolmaster, Hanson passed on the chance to attend film school with the Scorseses, Lucases and Spielbergs. His cinema education came while editing the influential journal, Cinema. Using his day job as cover he would ring his idols and request interviews and set visits from the likes of John Ford, Vincente Minnelli and Samuel Fuller. </p> <p>Gradually he picked up screenwriting work. His first film, a superior B-movie called Sweet Kill, was made in 1972 but it was eight years before he completed his next feature. 'I know I took the long way round,' he laughs ruefully. 'But I kind of pursued two routes at the same time - writing and directing. It wasn't until The Bedroom Window in 1987 that I could persuade someone to let me do both together.' Along the way there were hiccups. Roman Polanski was set to film his script of White Dog hot off Chinatown. 'I thought 'fantastic' because I was a fan. Could it be this easy that I'm going to get to do this fantastic thing.' It wasn't. Charged with having sex with an underage girl, Polanski skipped bail and the country in 1978. Hanson eventually collaborated with his mentor, the irascible Fuller on the allegorical film in 1982. </p> <p>So Hanson strikes a dissonant note. At a time when many of his peers have made their best movies, Hanson is in his prime, fusing a winning mix of studio gloss and indie sensibilities. The actors and critics like him, audiences are apparently divided.How long will Hollywood support him? </p> <p>He is philosophical: 'I know the leverage I've got now is fleeting. You lose it as easily as you get it so I appreciate it. I look at it as 'okay, now I can do one more movie in the way that I want'. You know, I approach it all one at a time.' </p> <p><strong>Hanson's track record </strong></p> <p><strong>The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992) </strong><br> A prosperous suburban family face the ultimate nightmare: a duplicitous nanny worms her way into their home and affections with evil intent.</p> <p><strong>The River Wild (1994) </strong><br> Meryl Streep turned action heroine in this tense drama about a family's rowing holiday ruined by the presence of a menacing stranger.

  "<p>While Fulham lost their 100 per cent record, after a goalless draw at Wolves, Watford crept to within two points of them at the top of the table with a 2-0 win at Nottingham Forest. Watford, having survived some early scares, seized the initiative through two strikes by Micah Hyde. </p> <p>The most Dramatic First Division win of the day was that of struggling Stockport County at home to Bolton. Despite their crippling injury problems, Stockport seemed virtually certain of victory when they went 3-0 ahead. Bolton then made it 3-3, but were sunk by a last-minute goal from Aaran Wilbraham. </p> <p>The programme enlivened by two other comebacks, with Portsmouth and Norwich recovering from two goals down to get maximum points at the expense of Crystal Palace and Sheffield United. </p> <p>Palace, in control through two goals by Tommy Black, were sunk by replies from Steve Claridge, Thomas Thorgersen and Mike Panopoulos. Norwich got the better of Sheffield United with two goals in two minutes from Tony Cottee and Chris Llewellyn. In addition to their 4-2 defeat, United had Marcus Bent sent off. </p> <p>Also shown the red card was Wimbledon's Chris Willmott, at Crewe. However, the Dons could afford to be a man light - they romped to a 4-0 victory; Jon Harley, on loan from Chelsea, with two of the goals. </p> <p>If any team looked as if they might struggle to hold their own this season it was Gillingham. The fact that it has not yet worked out that way following the departure of Peter Taylor to Leicester has been due not so much to the work of his successor, Andy Hessenthaler, but the influence of Hessenthaler's backroom support duo of Richard Hills and Wayne Jones. </p> <p>Hessenthaler, who is continuing as a player at the age of 35, admits that he would not have been able to combine the two jobs but for the help of Hills, Gillingham's assistant manager, and Jones, their first-team coach. 'The one drawback of being in my position is that you do not see the full picture in a match. This is where they take so much of the pressure off me.' </p> <p>Hessenthaler admits that he might not have taken the plunge as early as he has but for the encouragement of Taylor. Previously Taylor's assistant, he recalls: 'When Peter left for Leicester, he was the one who urged me to have a crack at it. I wanted to play for as long as I could - I still do - but he felt that I could combine the two jobs.' </p> <p>He and Taylor, of course, go back a long way. Taylor signed Hessenthaler for Dartford, when he was player-manager of the non-league club and they worked together when Taylor was assistant manager at Watford. After Hessenthaler had moved to Gillingham, he was instrumental in Taylor getting the opportunity to succeed Tony Pulis there last year. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Hessenthaler likes to think that what he has learned from Taylor is bound to stand him in good stead as a manager himself. </p> <p>'The main thing about Peter is his honesty,' he says. 'I think that if you are up front and straightforward with them, they will always respond in a positive manner. I just try to be as honest with the players here as he was.'</p>",
  "<p>There's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy spending money if you've got it to spare, but watch out for tell-tale signs that it is getting out of control. </p> <p>One critical difference between shopping as fun and shopping as an addiction seems to be the lasting value ascribed to the purchase. </p> <p> 'If you use shopping as a way of dealing with feeling low and find that the act of buying is fun, but that when you get home you don't particularly want what you have bought, then you might want to reconsider what you do,' says economic psychologist Professor Paul Webley of Exeter University. </p> <p>These are questions you should ask yourself to see if you need to put your spending in perspective: </p> <p>\u0095 Are you unsure how much you are spending and on what? </p> <p>\u0095 Is your non-essential spending affecting your ability to pay essential bills? </p> <p>\u0095 Do you feel depressed after a shopping spree? </p> <p>\u0095 Is your spending a source of family/partner friction? </p> <p>If you answer 'yes' to one or more of the above questions you may want to look at your spending in more detail. These tips should help: </p> <p>\u0095 Do a proper budget and work out exactly how much you have to spend on luxuries after the essentials are taken care of. </p> <p>\u0095 Make a fresh start - clear the house of regretted purchases. </p> <p>\u0095 Plan your spending trips with more care - work out what you can afford to spend and have a good idea what you want to spend the money on. </p> <p>\u0095 Restrict your visits to shops and find other outlets for your leisure time (if you shop in your lunch hour join a gym instead). </p> <p>\u0095 When you go shopping, take a friend whose opinion you trust. </p> <p>If you have children, it is also worth thinking about what sort of example you are setting and how it may influence their ability to handle money. According to Webley the messages our society gives children about spending are mixed. On the one hand we have a consumerist system with lots of credit available; on the other, young people are being urged to save for the time when they retire, as the state will not be able to provide for them.</p> <p><strong>A spender and a borrower be </strong></p> <p><strong>The Homesters</strong></p> <p>Homesters have always been followers of fashion, but this has extended from their personal wardrobe into their home.

  "<p>Philip Pullman is an extraordinary writer who shares his surname with a train when he ought to be represented by a fantastical, winged vehicle. At the moment, though, what he needs is a winged pen. It takes him an entire day, each week, to answer fan letters. </p> <p>Adults and children alike have been bowled over by the first two books of His Dark Materials trilogy. His first book, Northern Lights, won the Carnegie Prize. His second, The Subtle Knife, was likened, in its ambition, to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. His work is demanding and unusual, children's literature at its best. His heroes make Harry Potter seem no more than a bumptious cartoon. J.K. Rowling encourages a jolly return to childhood; reading Pullman is not a 'return' to anything. He is sophisticated, metaphysical, unhackneyed. </p> <p>The Subtle Knife, published in 1997, ended in suspense. Since then, there has been in Pullman-fixated households a sense of expectation tinged with despair as he has missed one publishing deadline after another. When would he get his act together and finish the trilogy? By the time I met him, I was no longer complaining. I congratulated him at once on The Amber Spyglass, published on 1 November. </p> <p>It is a tremendous enterprise. Pullman country is no single place: he conjures parallel universes, like a possessed juggler. He is in command of the grand sweep and the tiniest of botanical details. I asked him about the world of the dead, which appears in the new book. Pullman proposes that each one of us has 'a death' that goes with us through life 'a meek, pale chaperone'. His world of the dead is a terrible, understated, monochrome place. </p> <p>I told him that I was scared by it - I longed to get out. Did my reaction worry him? 'No,' he said, visibly pleased. He wants his readers to value life. His living worlds are iridescent, populated with marvellous, outlandish creatures: shaggy blue bison, foxes which can only understand the present tense, angels with a taste for Kendal mint cake. But none of this is at the expense of our world. There will eventually be a return to reality, a second, gloriously reconstituted Fall. </p> <p>Pullman is an original but would be the last person to agree. He disarmingly claimed to have 'stolen ideas from every book I have ever read'. His heroes are Homer, Milton and Blake; Swift and Dickens are in there too. His landscapes tend to be romantic. His heroine, Lyra, is tomboyish, fearless. </p> <p>I told him that Lyra's mother Mrs Coulter (one of the most fascinating villains in children's literature) was my favourite character. She turned out to be his favourite, too. But even Mrs Coulter cannot compete with his boldest invention: daemons. A daemon is an alter-ego, a soulmate, the outward manifestation of an inner life. It can take any form: a butterfly, a snowy leopard, a barn owl. Children's daemons change all the time. An adult has one fixed daemon. What would his own daemon be?</p> <p>'You can't choose your daemon,' he replied hastily. 'You have to make the best of whatever you turn out to be.' His daemon would be a dolphin - for intelligence, agility - and also for a way of diving under subjects. In appearance, he could not be less like a dolphin. He looks like what he once was, a schoolteacher: tall, balding, bespectacled, in his fifties, with a comfortable, lively face. How much of the trilogy did he plan in advance? He said he had a sense of its overall 'architecture' and its ending but 'did not know what was going to happen on the way. What I am given is the story. What I have to contribute is my telling of it.' </p> <p>He was born in Norwich in 1946 in a service family. His father was in the RAF and posted abroad. 'We had no roots,' he said. He spent the early Fifties in southern Africa and Australia. But it was the travelling by boat across the world that helped to shape his imagination: it gave him a sense of the world on an epic scale. He savoured the remembered names: 'Las Palmas, Bombay, the Suez canal.' And he talked about the sea with gusto, almost as if it were in the room with us : 'It changes colour, the shapes of the waves change. That way of travelling is irreplaceable.' </p> <p>He spent his teens in North Wales, read English at Oxford (where he still lives) worked for a while at Moss Bross, 'an extraordinary experience' which he promises himself he will write about one day. He also worked as a librarian before training to become a teacher. Until he was 40, he taught in an Oxford middle school. He used to delight in telling them Greek myths. He also wrote school plays which he later adapted into novels. He would have been a friendly, occasionally fierce, teacher. He is glad he no longer teaches, saying that the national curriculum and the failure to trust teachers had 'destroyed everything that made teaching a pleasure'. </p> <p>Curiously, he describes himself as if he were not a writer either, but part of an oral tradition. He compares himself to a busking story-teller 'sitting on a carpet in a market place'. He likes to imagine people coming to 'sample' his stories. Those who enjoy them 'can stay and put coins in the hat'. He believes in the story-teller's power and told a tale to prove it. </p> <p>About 13 years ago, on a family holiday, it was his job to keep his five-year-old son, Tom, amused by telling him The Odyssey while waiting for supper to arrive: 'I'd wind up neatly as soon as I could see the food coming.' By the end of The Odyssey, 'Tom was sitting with a glass in his hand like this [Pullman pressed hard on the sides of an imaginary glass]. At the climax, he was so galvanised he bit a chunk out of the glass. That's the power of story-telling,' he concluded calmly, adding: 'Thank you Homer.' </p> <p>But not everyone who comes to sit on Pullman's carpet is inclined to put coins in his hat. He was described in the Catholic Herald as being 'far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter' and 'a million times more sinister'. This is nonsense, but not a surprising reaction. Pullman is an atheist with a mission. He describes science as the 'most successful achievement of the human race'.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he gave a remarkable speech called 'The Republic of Heaven' in which he succeeded in converting the words 'God is dead' into something positive. He refreshingly recruited Jane Eyre to his cause while giving Tolkien and C.S. Lewis the thumbs down for failing to salute the real world. He is not short of faith but it believes in humanity and in goodness, not in God. He believes we need this 'thing which I've called joy'. His is an engaging moral optimism. He laughs easily but has a stoical approach to everything that lies outside his control. The film rights for the trilogy have been sold. Did he fear his books would be ruined? 'No. Waste of time. Take the money and forget it. I have no power.' </p> <p>I asked him if reality seemed lacklustre after returning from his imagined worlds? 'No, the real world is better than stories.' I asked if he was able to live in the present, as his invented foxes do? He replied adamantly: 'There is no elsewhere.' But surely it is hard?

  "Refugees will get help to find jobs and integrate into communities in a government drive that will be seen as an admission that much of its rhetoric on asylum-seekers has been too harsh. <p>Immigration Minister Barbara Roche will urge the nation to celebrate the contribution refugees can make, while a national support network will smooth their passage into the community once their applications for asylum have been accepted. </p> <p>In a separate move, new guidelines will instruct police officers to challenge racist claims that are made about asylum-seekers. </p> <p>Roche wants to attack the idea that those fleeing persecution are 'welfare scroungers'. The measures, to be announced early next month, will be seen as a significant softening of government rhetoric. One senior source said: 'We have to completely confine asylum to whether somebody has a well-founded fear of persecution. </p> <p>'But once we see they do, and give them leave to remain, then we must make sure we are using people as best we can. The message is very strongly that we are a nation of immigrants, that we are all the better for it, and that we need to make the best use of everyone's talents.' </p> <p>A recent Home Office study found that more than a third of 263 refugees questioned had a degree or professional qualification. Yet over half of those with UK-recognised qualifications were out of work. The scheme will try to place refugees in work or on courses to turn their qualifications into UK-recognised equivalents. It will also attempt to forge good relations between refugees and police. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Refugee Council, which will help set it up, said asylum must remain a humanitarian rather than economic issue, but added: 'Once they are here, we want everybody to be able to contribute. If we are desperately looking for nurses and teachers we shouldn't be wasting the resources many of these people have.' </p> <p>The advice to police on challenging racist claims comes from the Association of Chief Police Officers and follows public disturbances over the arrival of asylum-seekers in the Channel ports. </p> <p>Refugee organisations have repeatedly complained that inflammatory talk about immigrant crime or 'floods' of bogus claimants encourages racist violence. </p> <p>The association will issue its new guidelines, drawn up by Kent Police, in January. The strategy in Dover and Folkestone earlier this year was to challenge 'wild claims' about refugees with facts. Police also reminded local newspapers - one of which described asylum-seekers as 'human refuse' - of their obligations under race relations law. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'You have to counter hysteria with facts. When anyone claimed that asylum-seekers were responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime, we said it was not true. Police visited local newspaper offices and discussed with editors the law as it related to inciting racial hatred.' </p> <p>The guidelines will not be compulsory. But Gurbux Singh, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, welcomed the move. 'If people in positions of authority send out a message that it is OK to discriminate against others, that gives a green light to some of the worst elements in our society.'</p>",
  "<p>I am convinced that a recipe should not be a set of rules to be followed to the letter for a mind-numbingly uniform result, but when I hear someone praising a recipe because it always works, my heart sinks a little. I believe a recipe should be treated as a living thing, something allowed to breathe, to change its nature to suit our ingredients, our mood and our desires. </p> <p>Have new cooks really come to rely on a set of regimented, foolproof orders that forbid them to use their own gut instincts? To me, there are few greater pleasures than cooking without being glued to a recipe, following our own instincts and common sense. Do not ignore those thousands of recipes published every year - there is much fun to be had with them - but I want to suggest, actually to beg, that sometimes we should use them lightly, instead following our own hunches. </p> <p>I want to encourage you to take in the spirit of the recipes that follow, but then to deviate according to your ingredients and your feelings, to understand that our ingredients and our hunger are variables that should not, cannot, be subjected to a set of formulas laid down in stone. I want to get you to break the rules. I want you to follow your appetite. </p> <p> You know what you like and what you don't. When shopping, you don't even bother to try some things on. Other things you dither over and reject. Other times you know, positively, instantly, instinctively, that something is right. Well, cooking can be just like that. </p> <p>A recipe is only telling you about someone else's taste. The writer is not allowing for your own. This is why I get exasperated with the more pedantic branch of the cookery-writing world that insists, 'This is the ultimate recipe, and this is how it must be done, otherwise it is just not right.' What they mean is that they have done this recipe over and over again and they think it is delicious and want you to try it, too. Fair enough. But to assume that their word is law is ridiculous - not to say downright arrogant. Don't be bullied by recipe writers. Listen to what they have to say - they know the pitfalls and also the fun to be had cooking - but trust your own taste, too. If you like the taste of a recipe as it is and the next line says, 'Add 300ml more cream', don't be bullied into adding the extra cream. Taste continually as you cook, and trust that taste. The crux of the matter is that it may be their recipe, but it is your supper. </p> <p> I have never believed in the foolproof recipe. It simply doesn't exist. No recipe can take into account what I call 'the variables'. How can any recipe tell you to cook a piece of fish for four minutes, then turn it over and cook the other side for two minutes longer? How does the recipe writer know how thick your pan is, the pressure of your gas, your version of moderate or high or simmer or stir? How do they know the accuracy of every oven, the thickness of your every cake tin, the nuances of every pot, pan and cooker? More importantly, how can that recipe assume to know the exact nature of your piece of fish? Telepathy? </p> <p>The fact is that food varies, and that is what makes it so interesting. Today's piece of cod may be slightly thicker than yesterday's. One brand of butter may differ from another. Olive oil changes with every bottle; that is part of its joy. So how can anyone be so pedantic as to give exact timings? Each egg, each steak, each potato is different and will behave in a different way in the pan. That is what cooking is about, and that is why it is essential to understand what you are doing rather than just mindlessly following a recipe. </p> <p> While some people like the 'certainty' that comes from following an exact recipe, others rarely bother with them. How many times do you hear someone say, 'I just throw it all together and it always seems to work out fine'? This does not always mean that they are experienced cooks - it may be more that they have an instinct for what might go with what. They may also have read or heard that x is good with y, or vaguely recall something they once ate. Whatever sort of cook you are there is nothing quite so rewarding as following your instincts and finding they pay off. </p> <p> There is a branch of cookery I called Cluttered Cooking. By this I mean recipes that are so choc-a-bloc full of ingredients and seasoning that the main ingredient itself has been lost. I find a lot of so-called fusion food suffers from this, as does some classical French cookery. I prefer the marriage of a few, intelligently chosen ingredients rather than a mishmash of everything in the cupboard. </p> <p>All the recipes in this book are a result of the pared-down approach. When people say they must follow a recipe, I often wonder if it is because they have not grasped the idea of less is more - the approach where just one or two ingredients are added to fish or meat or a vegetable to which they are perfectly suited. </p> <p>Whereas I would never wish to undermine the harmonious mixture of spices that work to flavour a curry sauce, say, I think we need to ask why we are adding something. What will it add and, frankly, what is its point? Anybody who doubts me need only roast a dish of slightly tart, green-speckled tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, some salt, whole garlic and black pepper, then compare it with one to which they have added aubergines, peppers, onions, courgettes, tomato sauce and oregano. One taste of the pared-down, uncluttered flavour of a roast tomato, its sweet-sharp, thin juices clean and unadulterated, and you will wonder why anyone would ever even consider making ratatouille.</p> <p><strong> A fishcake to console</strong> </p> <p> There is something peaceful and faintly reassuring about a fishcake. Old-fashioned food that reminds us of less frantic times. It is not for the sake of convenience that fishcakes are made with equal amounts of potato to fish. It is simply that the ratio seems right: not enough potato and the cakes lack substance, too much and they lack flavour. As alway s, it is up to us to nudge the two to make the recipe our own. Enough for 4-6. </p> <p><strong> 500g potatoes</strong> <br> <strong>500g salmon, haddock, cod, hake or any large-flaked white fish </strong> <br> <strong>milk for baking the fish in </strong> <br> <strong>a little flour for coating </strong> <br> <strong>butter and oil for frying </strong> <br> <strong>a large glass of white wine, not too dry</strong> <br> <strong>a small bunch of tarragon </strong> <br> <strong>1 medium carton (about 300ml) cream</strong> </p> <p> Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6. Peel the potatoes and cut them into large chunks, then boil them to tenderness in salted water. Meanwhile, put the fish into a baking dish, almost cover with milk - you can add a bay leaf or two if you like - then bake until the fish is opaque and will come easily from the bone or skin when you pull it. You can expect this to take about 10 to 15 minutes, bearing in mind that different types of fish take slightly different times to cook. </p> <p>Drain the potatoes, putting them back into the empty pan over a moderate heat for a few minutes if they seem wet, then mash them with a potato masher. Lift the fish from its milk, reserving the liquid, then pull the flakes away from the bones and skin. Tip the fish into the mashed potato, add salt and grind over some black pepper - if you wish to add any of the additional seasonings below, do so now - and mix briefly and gently, so as not to crush the flakes of fish too much. </p> <p>Shape the mixture into patties, as large or small as you like (I favour ones the size of a digestive biscuit and the thickness of an English muffin), coating each one lightly in flour as you go. I think you should avoid the temptation to err towards perfection. Wobbly cooking has a certain charm about it. </p> <p>Melt a little butter and oil in a frying pan (you need enough to coat the bottom of the pan) and fry your cakes till they are softly golden. This should take no more than a couple of minutes on each side. Keep them hot in a low oven. </p> <p>Wipe the pan out with kitchen paper, add the glass of wine and let it bubble down over a high heat until there are just a few tablespoons left; strip the tarragon leaves from their stems and drop them into the wine as it bubbles. Pour in the cream and a wine glassful of the fish milk and bring to the boil, turning it down to a fierce simmer so it thickens somewhat. Season with salt and pepper, then pour it over the fishcakes. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> Some good things to add to your fishcakes</strong> <br> Chopped, vivid-green parsley leaves; 5 or 6 mashed anchovies; a few shakes of anchovy sauce; chopped tarragon leaves; chopped dill; chopped leeks cooked in butter till soft. </p> <p> <strong> A chilli-hot, citrus-scented fishcake </strong><br> Forget the potatoes. Skin the fish (500g will be enough for 4 people). Blitz 2 spring onions, 2 cloves of garlic, a couple of small, seeded red chillies and 6 lime leaves together with a handful of coriander leaves in a food processor to make a thick sludge. Mix in 1 tbsp of nam pla (Thai fish sauce) and tip it into a bowl. Whiz the fish to a coarse paste, then mix it with the seasonings and shape into small cakes. Some flour on your hands will be useful here. Fry till golden brown. </p> <p> <strong> A smoked fishcake </strong><br> The smoky flavour of cured haddock, Arbroath smokies or even smoked salmon makes a beautiful, rather homely tasting fishcake, reminiscent of Victorian high tea. It is flattered enormously by a cream and parsley sauce (simply substitute parsley for the tarragon above, then whiz the sauce in a blender). Cured haddock and smokies will need cooking in milk, as above. Smoked trout or salmon can be added directly to the potato. </p> <p> <strong> Tinned-fish fishcakes </strong><br> Lovely. Canned salmon and sardines make deeply flavoured fishcakes. You will need the same quantity as fresh fish, and you will have to drain them of their oil or water. Squeeze wedges of lemon over. </p> <p> <strong> Little prawn cakes </strong><br> Make these in the same way as the chilli-hot cakes above but using defrosted cooked prawns. I sometimes add a dollop of mayonnaise and a little flour - the mayonnaise adding lusciousness, the flour holding the fragile little cakes in one piece. </p> <p> <strong> Chicken, garlic, herbs - a simple supper</strong> </p> <p> If we are to eat well, we need to know how to exploit every bit of flavour in our food. The idea that follows does exactly that. Meat is cooked slowly on the bone over a low to moderate heat so that, as it tenderises, it leaves a thin film of goo - the caramelised meat juices - with which we can make a sauce (when I say sauce, I mean something quite thin and meagre in quantity, but intensely flavoured rather than a copious creamy blanket). </p> <p>There is something neat about this recipe, and I am not talking about its frugal use of kitchen equipment, though that is another point in its favour. The shopping list, as always, is short. The method is straightforward, undemanding. Spinach or courgettes, briefly boiled and tossed with butter and lemon juice, and some French bread for mopping your plate might be good here. Enough for 4. </p> <p><strong> free-range chicken - either a small bird, jointed by the butcher, or 2 chicken pieces per person, skin and bones to remain in place</strong> <br> <strong>olive oil </strong> <br> <strong>a thick slice of butter </strong> <br> <strong>6 large, sweet cloves of garlic </strong> <br> <strong>a small bunch of parsley, plus tarragon, thyme or chervil </strong> <br> <strong>a large wine glass of white wine or dry vermouth </strong> </p> <p>Rub the chicken all over with a little oil and some black pepper. In a large pan - it can be high-sided or shallow but it must have a lid - warm enough olive oil to give a small puddle in the bottom, then add the butter. Once the butter starts to froth, put in the chicken pieces and keep the heat moderately high while they colour. A pale and relatively even gold is what you are after. </p> <p>Meanwhile, put the whole unpeeled garlic cloves on a board and, with the flat blade of a knife, squash them so they flatten but remain fairly intact. Throw them in with the chicken. Turn down the heat so the fat under the chicken is gently fizzing, then add a little sea salt, cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook over a low to moderate heat. The time it takes to cook will depend on the thickness of your chicken joints, but expect them to need about 40 minutes. You will have to turn them during cooking so they colour on all sides. </p> <p>Meanwhile, pluck the leaves from the herbs and chop them roughly. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish or warm plates, then fish out the garlic (although the garlic has done its work, it may be tender and sweet and is worth adding to the plate, though the skin should be discarded at some point). Tip off most of the fat from the pan - what you are after is the golden, caramelised juice stuck to the bottom - then turn up the heat, pour in the wine and add the herbs and let it bubble. Scrape away at any stuck bits in the pan, encouraging them to dissolve into the wine with a wooden spoon. Let this all bubble away for a minute or two until you have a thin liquor. It should be pale and interesting. Now taste the juice for seasoning - it may need salt, pepper or a squeeze of lemon juice - and spoon it over the chicken. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> A buttery finish </strong><br> Once the wine has bubbled down, whisk in a thick slice of butter (about 50g), cut into tiny cubes. Taste and spoon over the chicken. </p> <p> <strong> Or a creamy one </strong><br> Once you have removed the chicken from the pan and poured in your wine or vermouth, let it bubble away until you have only half of it left, then add about half as much cream. As it continues to bubble, stir in chopped parsley and slightly less chopped tarragon. Finish with salt, black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. </p> <p> <strong> Lamb with garlic and lemon </strong> <br>What works for a chicken thigh will also work for a lamb chop. Try the original idea but with chump chops and adding parsley and mint. Finish with the squeeze of a lemon. </p> <p> <strong> Pork chops with apple and cream </strong><br> Rib chops, with their generous marbling of integral fat (rather than a loin chop with its great wodge of fat running alongside the lean meat), are delectable cooked this way. You should let them colour well before turning down the heat, adding an apple or two, peeled and cut into small cubes, and letting it colour with the pork. When it is time to take out the meat, leave the apple be, then add the wine and let it simmer down a bit before pouring in a small pot of double cream. Stir, taking the sediment from the pan with you and dissolving it into the cream with your wooden spoon. Herbs are not really needed here, though the garlic is. I once crushed a few juniper berries, adding them after the meat and fruit had browned, to great effect. </p> <p> <strong> A no-fuss puff-pastry vegetable pie</strong> </p> <p> I have never understood why some people come over all sniffy about ready-made puff pastry. It is a perfectly good commercial product - light, crisp and a joy for people like me who imagine they have better things to do than make their own. (Shortcrust is different altogether because they never put enough butter in the commercial stuff and anyway, it's as easy as toast to make.) You can buy prepared puff pastry chilled or frozen and now made with butter instead of vegetable fat. But the best invention must be puff pastry that is ready rolled and cut to size. The sort that comes in a long, thin rectangle is the most useful of all - it can become a pie or a millefeuille in the time it takes you to find the rolling pin, though you might like to roll it just a tiny bit thinner, so it becomes even lighter and crisper. Enough for 4. </p> <p> <strong>5 medium-sized onions </strong><br> <strong>enough butter or oil to cover the bottom of a medium-sized shallow pan</strong> <br> <strong>350g of any firm variety of mushrooms, or a mixture </strong><br> <strong>chopped thyme, lemon thyme or oregano (just enough to sit in the palm of your hand)</strong><br> <strong>about 200g cr\u00e8me frache </strong> <br> <strong>425g puff pastry</strong> <br> <strong>a little beaten egg or milk to glaze the pastry </strong> </p> <p> Peel and roughly chop the onions and let them cook slowly with the butter or oil over a low heat for 20 minutes or so, until they are golden, soft and almost transparent. Tear or slice the mushrooms into large, bite-sized pieces and add them to the onions, adding a little more butter or oil if they soak it all up. Leave them to turn golden and tender but stir them from time to time so they do not stick and burn. Season them with the chopped herbs and stir in the cr\u00e8me frache, grinding in a little salt and pepper as you go. You want a mixture that is creamy rather than runny, so let it bubble for a minute or two to thicken. </p> <p>Heat the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. The pastry needs to be rolled into two rectangles about 35cm by 20cm (conveniently the same measurements as the ready-rolled frozen stuff). Lay one piece on a lightly floured baking sheet and spread the mushrooms and onions over, leaving a good finger-thickness of bare rim around the edge. Brush a little beaten egg, milk or even water around the rim, lay the second rectangle of pastry over the top and squeeze the rims together to seal. It is worth being zealous about pinching the pastry - there shouldn't be any possibility of the filling escaping. Brush with more of the beaten egg or milk so the pastry will take on a rich golden shine in the oven, then cut a few little holes in the top to let out the steam. </p> <p>Bake the pie until it has puffed up like a cushion and is the colour of honey. This should take about 25 minutes. It is worth sneaking a look at the bottom to check if the pastry is crisp underneath (it should be fine, because this is not an especially wet filling). </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong>Some other good things </strong><br> There is magic, at least there is for me, in the bringing together of mushrooms, cream and puff pastry, but there are other fillings you can try here, too. </p> <p> <strong> A Gorgonzola and broccoli pie </strong><br> If broccoli ever seems just that bit too 'good for you', you can always take the smugness off its face by mixing it with cream and cheese. It works well in a pie like this in place of mushrooms. Cook the florets briefly, drain them, then fold them in with the onions and cr\u00e8me frache above. As we're lacking the savoury note of the mushrooms, I suggest some cheese - a blue, perhaps, such as a creamy Gorgonzola, a little Roquefort or Cashel Blue from Ireland. </p> <p> <strong> Garlic, cream and potato pie </strong><br> If you have any leftover pommes dauphinoise, I suggest you add a few softened onions and stuff it all between two sheets of pastry as in the pie above. I know potatoes in pastry sounds like a carbohydrate overdose but the effect is softened by the garlic-scented cream and buttery onions. Pushing your fork through golden, flaking pastry and slices of melting, cream-sodden potato is utter bliss. </p> <p> <strong> Pumpkin pie (but not that pumpkin pie) </strong><br> When I say pumpkin pie, I mean a savoury one with onions and cream, not the bland, over-rated tart that I have never managed to get the hots for. Peel a small pumpkin, cut it into chunks and roast with a generous amount of butter. When the golden flesh is soft and sweetly caramelised, add it to the softened onions above with the cr\u00e8me frache and a very little ground cinnamon. Pile it on to the pastry and top as usual. Great as a side dish for sausages. </p> <p> <strong> A thin, crisp fruit tart</strong> </p> <p> There are, I would venture, few more tempting sights than a baking tray of crisp, flaky fruit tarts fresh out of the oven. If you make your own pastry (and why not, if you have the time and the patience?), they will be sublime, but even with shop-bought puff pastry they are pretty fine. The trick is to roll the pastry as thin as you dare and bake them in a very hot oven. To get them at their most pleasurable, eat them warm, with cream or vanilla ice cream, so you get a mouthful of crisp, hot pastry, luscious fruit and cold ice cream all at once. Enough for 6. </p> <p><strong> 340g pack of defrosted puff pastry or a 425g pack of ready rolled </strong> <br> <strong>4 fairly tart dessert apples</strong> <br> <strong>a thick slice of butter, melted </strong> <br> <strong>a little caster sugar</strong> </p> <p> Get the oven really hot. I set mine at 230 C/ gas mark 8. Roll the pastry out as thin as you can without actually being able to see through it. If the tarts are to be crisp and flaky, the pastry should be no thicker than a pound coin. If you have bought ready-rolled puff pastry, then roll it out just a little more. </p> <p>Using a large saucer or small side plate as a template, cut out six discs of pastry. Using something smaller (a cup, say), score a slightly smaller circle within each one so you have a small rim. This will rise and hold in the apples. Slide the pieces of pastry on to a baking sheet, then prick the centre circles of pastry all over with a fork, which will stop them puffing up too much in the oven and throwing the apples off. </p> <p>Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and carve out their cores, then slice them thinly. Arrange the slices on the pastry discs (I like to do this in rather formal, overlapping circles). Brush the apples and pastry with melted butter, then dust them with a fine layer of sugar - anything more generous would make the tarts too sweet. Bake them until the pastry is golden and is fully crisp underneath, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before eating. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> Leftover pastry </strong><br> Parsimonious cooks will no doubt want to use the scraps of leftover pastry. My suggestion is to brush them with melted butter and dust them with grated Parmesan, then bake as above and eat while still hot and crisp. Frankly, I don't bother. We are only talking about a few scraps of pastry. </p> <p> <strong> A large apple tart </strong><br> There is something rather territorial about having your own fruit tart. If you prefer one large one to put on the table and cut up between your friends, then use one sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry, score a thin border around the edge, prick the centre and lay overlapping slices of apple, as thin as you can cut them, all over. Brush with melted butter, sprinkle with sugar and bake as above. </p> <p> <strong> A cheese and apple tart </strong><br> When you have brushed the tarts above with the butter, scatter a fine layer of finely grated Parmesan over them and bake as above. Neither a starter nor a pudding, this. More of a snack, really. </p> <p> <strong> Pear tarts </strong><br> Pears can produce the finest tarts of all, possessing a lusciousness that apples lack. The trick is to cook the fruit slightly beforehand so its flesh is soft and juicy. This is easy. Make up enough sugar syrup to cover the peeled, halved and cored pears (just put the pears in a pan, cover them with water and tip in a cupful of sugar), then simmer till they are tender to the point of a knife. Lift them out, drain them briefly, then slice thinly and overlap the slices on the pastry. Brush them with some of the sugar syrup, then bake as above. </p> <p> <strong> A banana tart </strong><br> Cut out and prick the tarts as above. Cut six bananas into slices as thick as pound coins, then divide them between the pastries. Brush them, and the pastry edges, with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. After 10 minutes or so in the oven, brush the tarts with melted apricot jam, then return them to the oven for a few minutes more. Eat hot, offering everyone the cream jug or a ball of vanilla ice. </p> <p> <strong> Apricot tarts</strong><br> Crisp pastry and juicy fruit. Use tinned apricots, or halve, stone and poach some fresh ones in a little sugar and water. Drain them well, then lay them on the pastry, cut side up, and bake till the edges are just caught and the pastry crisp. Since they are so heavy with juice, you may find you need neither ice cream nor cream. They are rich enough as it is.</p> <p> Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> - recipes are updated daily.</p>",
  "<p>'What about some maples then?'</p> <p>'No, can't stand them.'</p> <p>'Oh, all right then.'</p> <p>Nothing, you see, is planted in this garden without exhaustive debate. No stone is left unturned when considering the relative merits of every potential plant. Not. It is a visceral thing. Some plants you like and some just don't do it. Prejudice rules and everything runs along nicely until one day you are surprised by something, love it, check it out and remember that you hate it. </p> <p>This used to confuse me but now I rather like having these fixed views overturned. At this rate, by the time I am creeping round the garden on my Zimmer frame it will be filled with rhododendrons, heathers, dwarf conifers, maples, begonias, bergenias and yuccas - but not yet, oh Lord, not yet.</p> <p>Actually, I do have maples, lots of them, but they are all the same type, Acer campestre , the field maple. There are an awful lot of different kinds of maple, but only one British one and this is it. In its own way it is as good as any. The late, great but wildly opinionated dendrologist Alan Mitchell described it as 'depressingly moderate in all departments'. I disagree with him about this, as I do with most of his aesthetic judgments about trees. We have half a dozen growing as trees and hundreds of others making a hedge. It does both tricks with great ease and elegance. By the time you are reading this it will have developed its fabulous golden autumn colour - not as lauded as its flashier transatlantic cousins, but pretty good and certainly the best in our garden.</p> <p>It seems to me that this is an undervalued indigenous garden plant and, rather like hawthorn, is still mainly considered as a 'wild' tree of the agricultural hedgerow. But it is a waste to leave it out of the garden. It holds its shape very well as a hedge, coming into leaf early and losing them late, grows fast and very sturdy, but only needs trimming once a year to look good. It also makes a good small tree which will take any amount of shaping. There are a few 'garden' varieties, none of which I have grown or seen, but they sound promising. A c 'Postelense' probably sounds the best. It has yellow leaves when young, turning greener as the summer progresses. A campestre 'Schwerinii' is a purple- leafed version.</p> <p>The other maple that most town gardener's are all-too-familiar with is A pseudoplatanus or the sycamore. This is a weed in a small town garden, shading out everything beneath it and producing seedlings by the thousand. But in open country, near the sea or on the edge of a wood it can be a magnificent tree, hunkering down against foul weather with the same muscular indifference that it tolerates urban pollution. I cannot think of a good reason to plant one, but if you have a good specimen foisted on you then enjoy it, especially its new leaves in spring. There are a number of varieties of sycamore. A pseudoplatanus 'Atropurpureum' has interesting leaves that are green above and purple below (the opposite of the copper beech). A pseudoplatanus 'Brilliantissimum' never reaches anything like the size of the parent plant but does develop leaves that start out shrimp pink before becoming green via a yellowy phase.</p> <p>I have grown a Norway maple and they are like a more refined, less invasive sycamore. It was certainly beautiful in autumn, turning lemon yellow before sometimes blushing red.</p> <p>A platanoides is not so different from a sycamore, but more refined and apparently less able to cope with salt spray. Its refinement has been induced to a wide range of garden flavours by breeding, ranging from the diminutive 'Nanum' or 'Globosum' to the upright 'Columnare' and the purple (or almost chocolate) 'Goldsworth Purple'. I like my Norway maple species-straight.</p> <p>That is pretty much it for the European maples, but I appreciate that none of these are what most people think of when you conjoin 'garden' and 'maple'. I suspect that A palmatum is the maple that most people reach for when they want a shrubby tree to decorate a small garden. It is highly decorative with its low mounds of finely cut leaves glowing with autumn colour. I have not yet worked out why I do not like them. I did try growing A palmatum ' Dissectum Atropurpureum' and for about five years it sulked, obstinately refusing to grow or gracefully die.</p> <p>There are only two considerations to take into account when buying a Japanese maple - the colour and the shape of the leaves. The colour ranges from red through bronze and all the usual shades of green, and the leaf shapes include the remarkably fine, deeply cut leaves of the dissectum group and the Japanese maples with bigger, more recognisably maple leaves. Actually there is also another, completely different leaf shape only found on A carpinifolium , and the name gives away its similarity to the hornbeam. But like all maples, it has the familiar helicopter seeds.</p> <p>My favourite Eastern maple is A griseum , the paperbark maple from China. The leaves dutifully do their maple bit in autumn, turning rich scarlet, but the bark adds a spectacular sideshow, peeling and flaking to reveal a cinnamon-coloured underlayer. I would love to grow one here.</p> <p>The third group of maples comes from America. At their autumnal best the maples of the East coast are staggering. Whereas the Japanese maples are all small, with the largest reaching no more than 50ft, many of the American maples make magnificent 100ft-plus trees. We inherited a sugar maple, A saccharum (not to be confused with the similarly named silver maple, A saccharinum ) in our last garden, but it only blushed apologetically instead of the expected explosion into crimson. The truth is that it is a very rare year that we can provide the combination of very hot August days and very cool nights that they need to produce that foliar orgasm. A rubrum , by the way, will not colour well if it grows on chalk, regardless of temperatures, but give it acidic soil and it is one of the first to turn a brilliant crimson.</p> <p>Finally, the best American maple for a small garden is a form of A negundo , known as the box elder (nothing to do with either box or elder). The basic A negundo is a common wild tree in the States, identifiable by the way the leaves appear as three separate short-stalked entities. It is tough and will grow almost anywhere, but is very dull. However, A negundo 'Auratum' is an intense yellow all summer, fading to green in autumn. A negundo 'Variegatum' is fringed dramatically with white variegation and A negundo var. violaceum has lilac shoots covered with a powdery bloom in winter. Sounds wonderful.</p> <p><strong>My roots: a week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I took my penstemon and salvia cuttings at the beginning of this month, which is a little later than usual. On the whole this has worked out fine for the penstemons, which are terribly willing to strike at almost any time, but caused a difficulty with Salvia guaranitica that I had not come across before.</p> <p>When I take these semi-ripe cuttings I look for healthy growing shoots without a flowerbud. There are normally half a dozen or so on each plant at any time. This year I was struggling to find any at all because each plant was entirely covered with flowers.</p> <p>These have been very late in coming - not a sign until September, but when they did arrive it was with a vengeance. S guaranitica is very unlikely to survive a winter here so I depend on the cuttings for next year's stock.</p> <p>This year, I took more cuttings in March from the new growth of the overwintered batch, so I had a double lot - which might account for the lateness in flowering. One of the reasons for being a little behind in all this is because the mist-propagator has been out of action for a few weeks - one of the cables was shorting and blowing all the fuses in the house - so I have been trying to cram it with plants to make up for lost time and get things to root before we run out of light. In a week or two I am going to have the whole thing dismantled and moved to another bit of the greenhouse. </p> <p>I have found that all chicories will endure pretty much any amount of cold, but the combination of winter wet rots them. You get a slimy brown layer of dead leaves over the outside of the plants which, if it is not removed, acts almost as a mulch. So I have put open-ended cloches over the radiccio, Red Treviso and endives and this will keep them dry, yet ventilated until well after Christmas. </p> <p>We have started to tidy up the Jewel garden, moving things, dividing and cutting back. I would rather leave all this to spring, on the grounds that the ghost of a garden looks good in winter, especially on a frosty day, but our ground is so wet that it makes sense to do it when we can. Also, the number of tulips in the ground severely limits plant upheaval once they start to appear. So between now and Christmas is the best time to clear the decks. The trouble is, once the decks are clear, there is not enough left behind to satisfy the eye. Along with the grey, leaden wetness, it is one of the reasons I loathe November and December. So pray for frost. </p> <p> If you have not yet had a proper frost, don't get cocky - you will. Buy some horticultural fleece in readiness and watch the weather forecast. If there is a likelihood of frost use the fleece to drape over winter crops or tender plants - it is the simplest and cheapest way of extending the autumnal flowering period for a week or so longer. </p> <p>Time to order garlic and to start planting if you have already got it. I plant two or three separate lots between the end of October and Christmas. Push the cloves in plenty deep - at least 1 inch below the surface. </p> <p>Even if you are silly enough not to collect and use all your fallen leaves, do clear all leaves from rock gardens, ponds and the crowns of herbaceous plants, otherwise they can form a soggy matt which will rot plants and kill fish.</p>",
  "<p>Drug users who fall behind with payments to their dealers are being targeted by a vicious new breed of gangster who purchases their debts and then uses extreme violence and intimidation to obtain payment. </p> <p>The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) has expressed alarm at the trend which has resulted in serious injury and death over small amounts of money. </p> <p>In one case a man who owed his cannabis supplier \u00a350 was attacked by two strangers who punched him repeatedly, sprayed ammonia in his face then shot him in the leg. In other cases, businesses have been firebombed and house windows have been shot out in an attempt to intimidate the owners. A spate of shootings and stabbings in the north of England in recent weeks is being linked to drug debt enforcement and battles to control this lucrative new market. </p> <p>The gangs \"buy\" debts by offering dealers an instant payment of around half the outstanding amount. They then pursue the debtor, claiming the full amount plus interest and \"expenses\" that may amount to several times the sum owed. They can act with relative impunity as the debtors are reluctant to involve the police. </p> <p>Roger Gaspar, director of intelligence at NCIS, told The Observer: \"We are seeing the start of an alarming trend. It appears to be organised and there is often extreme violence, even though the amounts of money may be relatively small.\" </p> <p>Debtors who are unable to raise money are forced to sell drugs themselves, sell their possessions or steal. </p> <p>Last month heroin addict Clifford Shepherd told Basildon Crown Court that he had been forced to burgle homes to pay off his drug debts. He said he was accompanied on his crime spree by a debt collector until his \u00a3800 drugs bill was paid off. The gang member would point out properties to be raided and Shepherd would hand over all the stolen items. He was jailed for four years. </p> <p>Last week former Brighton pub landlord Christopher Mayne was jailed for six years after a court heard he had been forced into making daily trips into the town centre to sell heroin and other drugs after falling behind with payments to his own dealer, who sold on his debt. </p> <p>A defence of acting under duress because of drug debts is becoming increasingly common at courts across the country. However, judges are reluctant to take such claims into account as, even where there is strong evidence of violence having been used, there is often little to support the defendant's version of events. </p> <p>When Raymond Griffith ran up debts of several thousand pounds to a gang in Newcastle, he arranged to repay the amount over several months. However, the debt was purchased by a gang of third-party enforcers and Griffith was told to travel to London and pick up \u00a3250,000 worth of Ecstasy tablets or be executed. Detectives from the National Crime Squad followed him and arrested him as he picked up the drugs in a pub at King's Cross station. Last week Griffith was jailed for seven years. </p> <p>In August, 18-year-old Brian Kinnear was jailed for eight years after carrying out a cowardly attack on 84-year-old Catherine McKenzie. He claimed he had been acting under duress in order to pay off a drug debt of just \u00a313. His victim died three days later. </p> <p>Last summer, 22-year-old Christopher Munro was jailed for four years after holding up a petrol station at gunpoint. He told the court he had been forced to commit the crime in order to repay a \u00a3800 drug debt. </p> <p>The use of third-party debt collectors is being blamed for an astonishing rise in the number of professional kidnappings - up by 500 per cent since last year. According to a police report, the drug debts are sold to gangs which specialise in kidnapping in an attempt to recoup their money. \"Such kidnaps are extremely violent with the hostage being starved, tied up, threatened, beaten and even murdered.\"</p>",
  "A few months ago I was on a news chat show with a reactionary pundit - Peter Hitchens, perhaps, or maybe Melanie Phillips, they all blur into one as I get older - and he or she was struck by the contrast between the decent British and the turbulent continentals. 'We remove our governments in free elections,' came the patriotic bellow. 'French presidents are brought down by mobs in the street.' <p>The line has since become a favourite charge against the European Union in our patriotic, foreign-owned press. It is probably useless to point out that no recent French government has been overthrown by revolutionary crowds. (Even General de Gaulle survived the student uprising of 1968. He resigned a year later after a bathetic defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform.) The supposedly docile British are far more incendiary. Striking miners lost Edward Heath the 1974 election as surely as the Winter of Discontent destroyed Jim Callaghan's chances in 1979. Poll-tax rioters and the refusal of millions to pay the hated charge persuaded the Tory Party to dump Margaret Thatcher. If you believe that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and those on the Right who praise our passivity are quite adamant on this point, then you must admit that Britain has hosted a war which has taken 3,000 lives in the last 30 years and may not be over yet. No other Western European country has as many casualties of political violence. </p> <p>It is therefore conceivable that the fuel protesters will rip the guts out of the Government when their deadline runs out on 13 November. New Labour will have made concessions by then. But will a few pence off petrol tax or a cut in vehicle excise duty satisfy men drunk on the praise of William Hague and the Daily Mail ? Will they empty the roads again? Will a second blockade destroy Blair's reputation for competence? Will the gold Gordon Brown planned to stuff in the mouths of the electorate be wasted on deep cuts in fuel duty which will buy few votes if the oil cartel uses them as cover and raises its prices and profits? A wounded New Labour could stumble on like John Major's administration after the ERM disaster. Its nemesis would come on the day after the election when the voters awake to find William Hague in Downing Street, desperately hoping everyone has forgotten his promises to cut taxes and raise spending simultaneously. </p> <p>It could happen, but I suspect not. One of the pleasures of watching a culture which spends the national wealth of a medium-sized African country on probing public opinion is the joy of gloating at the failure of market researchers to second guess emotional surges. When Diana Spencer's car crashed, few predicted that millions would make fools of themselves by wailing for an aristocrat they had never met. The grieving process was embarrassingly brief. Moist newspaper supplements and TV specials were released to mark the first anniversary of the death 'that changed Britain for ever'. The readership and viewing figures were abysmal. Diana's mourners had dwindled into a small and rather sad cult. </p> <p>There are straws in the wind which suggest that the giddy roll from mass sympathy to indifference may hit the refinery protesters. Radio 5 Live is far better than any opinion poll at revealing the wisdom or alarming madness of your fellow citizens. During the blockade a large majority of callers were right behind direct action. The Fi Glover Show returned to the subject at the beginning of the month. David Handley, leader of Farmers for Action, the most militant group in the cheap-petrol lobby, was in the studio. He and everyone else was stunned by the near-unanimous abuse. 'You don't represent me.' 'You pocket my taxes.' 'I want to get to work/hospital/the children's day centre.' 'Who do you think you are?' 'Don't you dare do it again.' And the killer question: 'Why aren't you looking after your sheep?' </p> <p>The paradox of pro-car demonstrators stopping the motorists they claim to represent from using their cars cannot be hidden indefinitely. Last week the Government began its fightback and released hair-raising tales of intimidation of tanker drivers. More telling than the propaganda was a short statement from Chris Fox of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The indulgence officers granted hauliers and farmers, which amazed everyone who remembered the miners' strike, would be replaced by 'vigorous' policing, he said. This is a serious threat. As Lord Falconer and other New Labour lawyers have been whispering, Michael Howard and Jack Straw have ensured that the punishments for protest are now very vigorous indeed. </p> <p>It is not technically illegal to demonstrate in Britain. But if the police are out to get you, it can feel that way. Go on to oil refinery land and you can be arrested for aggravated trespass. Stand on the road outside, and charges for obstructing the highway can follow. Retire to the verge and prosecutors can use laws designed to stop misfits hounding celebs and arrest you for stalking. If you join a march of more than 20 people, you are legally obliged to do what the police tell you or face the consequences. If the oil companies get an injunction against you for restraining their trade, officers will act as their agents. The desire to turn protesters into criminals saturates the Home Office's Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Whitehall is modestly proposing that anyone who damages property, or merely discusses a plan to damage property, should be treated as a terrorist on a par with the Omagh bombers. </p> <p>These are the formal laws against robust dissent. An imaginative constabulary can deploy many others. Two weeks ago a man demonstrating against the digging of a quarry near the Neolithic Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire sat on a dry-stone wall. It collapsed. Helpful officers ran over to check he was all right and then arrested him for criminal damage. </p> <p>The most powerful doctrine of our time is that nation states are powerless in the global market place. It ignores the efforts of one powerful nation state - America - to override all resistance to free trade and deregulated markets and misses the dependence of corporations on compliant politicians. National leaders can still make life uncomfortable for executives in their borders. The rumour going around Whitehall is that Blair has warned the oil companies that he will hit them with a long and burdensome inquiry into their anti-competitive practices if they don't try a little harder to get the petrol tankers moving next time. </p> <p>I can't see the future and don't know if the bickering petrol protesters will give us a next time. If they do, they may learn what trade unionists and greens have known for years. The ancient rights of the British to protest are as much a part of a flattering national myth as the notion that mobs only bring down Ministries in a sinister place called Abroad. </p> <p>Like the Child Support Agency before it, the National Criminal Records Agency is plodding towards its opening ceremony without anyone but a few nervous civil servants being troubled by visions of a bureaucratic hell. </p> <p>Its founding idea appeared as sensible as requiring feckless fathers to pay for the upkeep of their children. The Government would allow the police to disclose the criminal records of job applicants looking to work with children to employers. Paedophiles would be uncovered and everyone else would feel a great deal safer. </p> <p>Repressiveness has its own momentum, however. A justifiable invasion of privacy for the few looks like becoming a trap for the many. Ministers liked the idea of prying so much they decided everyone's criminal records should be opened. All applicants will have to reveal if their pasts were shady or pure. The new criminal records agency will be vetting 10 million people a year - say highest estimates - when it begins work in the summer. </p> <p>Snooping will deter the hiring of ex-offenders and leave them with no option but to return to their thieving ways - hardly an intelligent crime-fighting strategy - even if the agency manages to release accurate records efficiently. </p> <p>There are good grounds for wondering if it will manage that basic task. Earlier this year I wrote about a Metropolitan Police report on the reliability of criminal records, which Scotland Yard was anxious suppress. Officers examined a random selection, it said, and found an 'overall error rate of 86 per cent'. Eighty-five per cent of the these were 'major errors, i.e. those that could potentially lead to... the possibility of financial compensation awards to those affected'. </p> <p>Even if the figures are a freak and other police forces record keeping is far better than the Met's, hundreds of thousands of people will be denied work because of fictitious crimes on their files. They would then have every reason to sue the Home Office. As would employers if they were not warned about the previous of convicted frauds before entrusting them with money. </p> <p>Because this is New Labour, only a private company is deemed fit to run the agency. The winner of the contract was Capita plc. What is worrying the Home Office civil servants who watched private contractors freeze the computers of the Passport Office and asylum department is that Capita's own record is worthy of examination. The complaints about Capita's delays in processing housing benefit claims in South London, upheld by the Local Government Ombudsman, stand out starkly. </p> <p>I'm sorry to crystal-ball gaze again, but it is at least possible that employers won't be getting criminal records by return of post. Applicants may well be left in limbo and on the dole waiting for a file that may be libellously inaccurate.</p>",
  "More than 2,000 miles of Britain's railways don't reach satisfactory standards, according to consultants hired by the rail regulator. <p>The reports conclude that Britain's battered railways will take 10 years to bring up to scratch because so many thousands of miles of track are classified as being in poor or very poor condition. </p> <p>The figures reveal the huge extent of the crisis facing Railtrack following the accident at Hatfield in which four people were killed. </p> <p>The report by Booz Allen says that up to 11 per cent of track checked between 1994 and 1998 was below a satisfactory standard. At the present rate of track replacement it will take until 2010 for all stretches of poor rail to be upgraded. </p> <p>'They are simply not spending enough,' said Jonathan Bray, railway expert with the pressure group, Transport 2000. 'In Japan a broken rail is unheard of. They spend so much more money on the kit they use. We think that track maintenance is unexciting.' </p> <p>The Booz Allen report was presented to the rail regulator last year. It said that there were 287 temporary speed restrictions in force across the rail network because of the poor quality of the track. </p> <p>The damning findings also revealed that many of the poor stretches of track were found on high-speed routes, whereas 'good' stretches of rail were found on little-used branch lines. The Hatfield accident was blamed on a cracked or broken rail. </p> <p>The findings will increase pressure on Railtrack to increase funding for replacing track. Tomorrow Tom Winsor, the rail regulator, is expected to announce a \u00a35 billion increase in Railtrack's funding over the next five years. He will urge the company to spend much more on maintaining and improving track, despite the knock-on effect of delays and cancellations. </p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive is also pushing for new safety guidelines for the train operating companies in the wake of the three fatal train crashes over the last three years at Southall, Ladbroke Grove and Hatfield. </p> <p>Options being considered include airline-style safety briefings for passengers, crumple zones for train carriages and new designs for rolling stock to ensure that trains remain upright even if they derail at high speed. </p> <p>The fatalities in last week's crash were caused when the buffet car tipped over and the roof was peeled off by overhead electrical gantries. </p> <p>John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, who is expected to make an emergency statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday, is set to announce new proposals for an overall safety body that would control all types of transport. </p> <p>He has been struck by the confusing differences in safety rules that govern trains, the airline industry and buses. </p> <p>Legal sources said yesterday that Railtrack will almost certainly face criminal prosecution as a result of the Hatfield derailment with the prospect of large fines for serious breaches of safety laws. </p> <p>A source close to the investigation teams said: 'Railtrack must be absolutely smack bang in the middle of it. I do not believe they can escape prosecution of one sort or another.' </p> <p>The role of Balfour Beatty, the contractor with responsibility for maintaining the stretch of track, will also be investigated. Winsor ordered the independent investigation this summer after it was revealed that the number of broken rails had increased sharply from 755 in 1998 to more than 900 this year. </p> <p>The new phenomenon of 'corner gauge cracking' of high speed rails identified after Hatfield has been blamed on record levels of traffic resulting from the unexpected rail boom since privatisation.</p>",
  "The Orange order has decided to use the new Human Rights Act it once opposed to challenge bans on controversial loyalist parades in Northern Ireland. <p>The order confirmed yesterday that they were now 'very close' to taking a test case on whether the ban on marching along Portadown's Garvaghy Road and the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast breaches human rights legislation. </p> <p>George Patton, the order's spokesman, said: 'We have set up a committee to look at the implications of the Human Rights Act. We now want to test the legislation because we believe the Parades Commission's ban on our parades violates freedom of assembly and expression enshrined in the Human Rights Act.' </p> <p>He declined to say which parade would be the subject of the court case, but added that it would be taken by a private individual rather than the Grand Lodge of Ireland, a local Orange district or county. 'It would have to be taken by an individual, because the case we will take will seek to prove that his or her individual rights have been violated,' Patton added. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Parades Commission, which the Government set up to adjudicate between loyalists and nationalists in controversial marches, welcomed the legal challenge. 'We have always said we would prefer to be challenged in the courts rather than the streets by the loyal orders. We knew people would want to test the Human Rights Act,' he said. </p> <p>The order has received constitutional legal advice from London-based lawyers on how to turn the human rights legislation to its advantage. A legal paper drawn up for the Grand Lodge urges the order to use Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which enshrines the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. </p> <p>However, the legal team warns the order that it must ditch its policy of no dialogue with the Parades Commission before taking up a test case in the courts. </p> <p>Orangemen at the centre of one of the marching storms - Drumcree - have backed the Grand Lodge of Ireland's move to test bans on marches with the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>David Jones, spokesman for the Orange Order in Portadown, said there had been a debate on which area should become the test case. However, Jones would not be drawn on whether the ban on the Drumcree march would be the first to go through the courts. </p> <p>He insisted that the Orange protest at Drumcree would continue despite the ban on the march along the nationalist Garvaghy Road. </p> <p>Jones and his fellow Orangemen have become embroiled in a fresh controversy over the flying of the Union flag in Mid-Ulster. A group of Portadown Orangemen defied a ruling from their local council on Thursday night and replaced Union flags taken down earlier from flagpoles in the town centre. </p> <p>'Our flying pickets replaced Union flags not only in Portadown but also Lurgan and Waringstown. We did this in protest at the decision by the council that under the law they could only fly the flag of this country on specified days. </p> <p>'There are Irish tricolours flying along the Garvaghy Road every day of the year. No one suggested taking them down. So we will do the same,' Jones added.</p>",
  "As a late sun stroked the last of this year's cotton, like billows of man-made clouds, old Ruby Walker sat on her porch with most of her 22 cats frolicking around her. The next few days will be particularly hard for the Walker family, since they were to have marked the nineteenth birthday of Ruby's granddaughter, Sandra Handy. However, there will be a different anniversary: 'She was just crossing the railroad line on her way home this time last year, when the shooting started and a bullet hit her right in the head.' There is a macabre intimacy to the murder. Ruby gestures towards the house behind her: 'It was their boy done the shooting. He only got 10 years and it's hard to look at them every day. He was, she adds, 'one of the gangbangers - fighting for territory'. <p>This is not the Bronx or Southside Chicago - this is a rural hamlet called Coahoma on the Mississippi reaches, in the heart of the Delta, an area which a nearby Pastor, Benny Brown, calls 'not a \"rural area\" but more of a reservation. A black poverty reservation.' </p> <p>'Reservation' is an apposite description of the poverty hidden from view, hidden from politicians, from those surfing the economic boom and hidden from America's presence in the world. </p> <p>They are deep wells of apparently irredeemable poverty, a dark side of the America which preens itself in front of the mirror with each jump of the Nasdaq and every State of the Union speech and offers itself to the planet in chat shows, mini series, and tales of dotcom billionaires in business magazines. This is an America which will never make even a cameo appearance on Friends or a footnote in Forbes or Business Week . </p> <p>While there is appalling poverty among white people in some places, these reservations are for the most part territory into which whites dare not venture and would not think to venture. In Coahoma, a little girl approaches my photographer: 'Sir, are you a white man?' </p> <p>'Do I look white?' he replies. </p> <p>'I guess,' she says. 'Is your friend a white man too?' </p> <p>This year's cotton is almost in, packed into great bales of white that dot the vast flatscape of the Delta, rising from the rich earth of 'Cotton Kingdom'. There are still a few fields left and loose cotton still blows across the earth and roads like a light, fluffy blizzard. </p> <p>But what the hell. The end of the accursedly dry Southern summer, and of the cotton harvest, is no time for celebration in these communities around the town of Clarksdale. Forty per cent of people here survive below the poverty line, which is set at $16,000 for a family of four. With the summer work now gone, the onset of Fall only serves to remind those who watch the seasons come and go from their porches and roadside perches that whatever the rhetoric from those now campaigning to become the next President of the United States, the reality will almost certainly pass them by: that theirs is the land that politics forgot; that as the sound and fury of the election increases, with only a fortnight to go, their 'reservation' is the price paid for the economic boom on which the election rides. </p> <p>The boom economy is the toast of a contemporary America, awash with money that has enriched not only the wealthy and superwealthy but a burgeoning middle class. The toast, too, of America's presidential election with both candidates debating how to spend the most lavish budget surplus in the country's history. </p> <p>George Bush's appeal is a brazen one: a windfall for those he sees as having generated the wealth - the rich and super-rich, with gestures of reward to the middle strata. Al Gore tried to make his central pledge to 'working families' but has been obliged to let the term slip from his lexicon of late, in favour of 'the middle class'. </p> <p>The fact is that there is little or no political capital to be gained by fighting for the votes of the poor in America, since - for the most part - the poor do not vote. But they exist: the underbelly is always there, either prop ping up the system or consuming its welfare dollars, whichever way you look at it; an underbelly that swells along with the wastelands where it lives, trapped in its own economic hex, out of sight and largely out of mind. </p> <p>In Mississippi, at the last Presidential election, only 33 per cent voted; in Coahoma County, even fewer. Around Clarksdale, people pay Washington as little mind as Washington pays to Clarksdale. </p> <p>When President Clinton came to office there was a grandiose plan to reform healthcare - which fell by the wayside. There was an 'initiative on race' entrusted to a special panel kept on such a tight rein that its members could not say what they wanted to say. Finally came the 'welfare reform' of 1996 which removed tens of thousands from the benefits rolls and sent them into jobs they often lost within weeks either through ineptitude or inability to live the working life. </p> <p>Clarkesdale is the epicentre of that which in eighteenth-century England was called the 'Blue Devils', adapted by plantation-speak during the 1890s to 'the Blues'. It is the town in which the famous 'Crossroads' is located at which the master of all bluesmen, Robert Johnson, is said to have sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his wizardry on the guitar. The old Negro lore has it that the musician must 'take a black cat bone and a guitar and go to a lonely fork in the road at midnight'. The guitarist will soon be joined by an 'unseen musician' who will 'play in perfect unison' before taking his instrument away from him - although the sound will continue until our guitarist's fingertips bleed. 'The music,' runs the legend, 'will eventually subside, and when all is quiet, you may go home. You will be able to play any piece you desire on the guitar, but you will have sold your eternal soul and are his in the world to come.' The crossroads is that between Highway 61, which splices America in two, north-south, and Highway 49 - now marked by a bricked-up, former laundromat. </p> <p>It was on a farm called Hopson, now site of an annual blues festival, that another Devil claimed many souls in Clarksdale: the first mechanical cotton-picking machine, which led to the mechanisation of the plantations, and began the great migrations north that in turn created the ghettoes of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, New York and Boston. </p> <p>And Clarksdale is also the Delta town through which Bill Clinton blew like a hurricane during his 'Poverty Tour' of July last year, in the footsteps of a similar journey made by Bobby Kennedy in 1967. There was a meeting with the locals in a flower store called 'Ooh So Pretty Flowers' managed by Shirley Fair, who has a collection of thick photo albums and likes the President because he 'cares about poor folks'. But, she says: 'Nothing has gotten any better. There's nothing here to grasp on to. The railroad is closed, the factories have gone. The good folks move on and the gangbangers take over the streets and that makes it harder for businesses to survive. The President wrote me a letter saying I could apply for a grant and employ 10 people. But there were so many rules and regulations I couldn't understand nothing. Always something to slow you and stop you. So I did.' </p> <p>The President had actually wanted to visit another place just north of Clarksdale, a much smaller rural community called Jonestown, but his spin doctors advised him against it - for reasons that become immediately apparent when one pulls into Main Street, whose sign lies on a scrap of grass next to an empty beer bottle. </p> <p>The approach to us here is a little different from that in Coahoma. In response to the first whites within living memory to buy beer and pecan nuts at the Deer Park grocery, a man with a hood over his head forms a pretend gun barrel with his index and middle fingers, flicks off the (thumb) safety catch and opens fire, with recoil. For the most part, however, a smile and some heartfelt respect meets nothing but hospitality and a return grin in places to which those above the poverty line never go. </p> <p>There is portrait of John F. Kennedy painted on one of the boarded-up store fronts - the paint is faded, the glass is smashed. The few businesses left open hide behind grills. </p> <p>Jonestown's mayor is also the town's Pentecostal Pastor, a pensive man and disarmingly honest about his isolation from power politics and the magnitude of his task, to the edge of hopelessness - but not over it. 'This was,' says Mayor Joe Phillips, 'a thriving rural community 20 years ago - the employment was farm labour - then came mechanisation, and people moved away. Then the whites left, and took the businesses with them. The buildings became dilapidated and fell in'. </p> <p>To try to stave off this decay, 'money is occasionally promised to the community,' says Phillips, from both federal and state funds. 'But when it is promised, it gets expended elsewhere. It always seems to disappears some place else, it doesn't get filtered down. They'll say that \"administration costs\" count for 30 per cent.' Why? 'Politics,' he replies simply. 'That's the bottom line. You can't just wait for things to happen. We are saying that to do anything, we have go to do it with private funding and we have got to do it ourselves'. </p> <p>Phillips's calling is, he says, to 'instill in people's minds that they can become self-sufficient, and dignified. Otherwise they are going to end up breaking up, tearing up. But I guess,' he adds, as though uttering some personal confession, 'that it's very solitary work. Very isolated. People stay away from you so that when you get hit, they won't feel the results. But I've always believed in the impossible; Jesus said: \"bring the blind man unto me, that he may see\".' </p> <p>The forecourt of the Deer Park Grocery is a gathering place for those wrenched from the land by the new demands of the 'Cotton Kingdom': a ragbag of gang fighters and those 'breaking up, tearing up', and their daytime lady friends, under the watchful eye of the sheriff's deputy. Or just people who may be heading that way, like Albert Mitchell. 'I always worked the farm,' says Albert, 'but now all the work is seasonal. The harvest is in, and you get cut. When I'm working, I don't drink. But when I'm not working you get jack shit to live on; I do a bit of plumbing and I drink. So now my wife is throwing me out, with the kids and all that.' </p> <p>Also among the company is Juliet Shaw, holding her baby - one of two, though she is only 18. She lives on the welfare payments for which young women like her are infamous and an easy target for political polemic, like most of the mothers at a Montessori school run by a Roman Catholic mission in the town centre. The nuns arrived in the building, a crack den, on 6 January 1993, and by 11 January the children had begun to arrive. 'Some of them,' says Sister Theresa Shields, watching basketball practice, 'go back to wonderful homes - others to appalling, abusive ones.' As she speaks, a car pulls out, blaring loud rap music: 'See You In Hell, Motherfucker!'. </p> <p>Not everyone in Jonestown is either locked in struggle or downcast by melancholia. Indeed, as he hobbles with his stick down a lazy, sunny street, it seems that nothing under the Delta sky could wipe the smile off Willie Gilbert's face. Willie was a truck driver earning reasonable money until a wheel crashed down on his ankle during a tyre change eight years ago. He doesn't find it easy to get by on his $500-a-month disability pension, but has adopted his own approach: 'eat slow'. And while eating slow,he looks back on his life: 'Now how many children I got? Got a whole bunch of 'em. Woulda had 29 if they'd all lived. Got 11 by one woman. Got two in California, boys. Got one in Washington DC. Don't know how many grandchildren...' But for one of his neighbours, memories of sweet times only make the present bitter. As Walhida sits on her porch, flies feast on the infected, weeping sore above her right eye. </p> <p>As ever in the Mississippi Delta, the greater the tribulations of this world, the more people cling to the promise of the next. Benny Brown peeps out from behind the hatch of the little kiosk caf\u00e9 he keeps on Main Street, selling 'Hog's Maws' and 'Chicken Gizzards'. Benny talks through his spectacles and between orders about 'poverty pockets' and 'reservations, weighing up the 'pre-King' and 'post-King' epochs on the Delta plains, and of the trade-off between the winning of civil rights and the loss of any kind of opportunity in the comfortless rural ghettoes that followed in their wake, embittering - and mocking - the sweetness of victory. On those 'reservations', Benny sees a 'vicious cycle' of 'poverty which creates problems that only deepen the problems further' - 'an influx of drugs, alcohol and crime'. Benny has his own view on how the cycle has to be broken and accordingly invites us to a Bible study class. </p> <p>A misty dusk - illuminated by a fat, low golden moon - settles on the ploughed plantation fields, as Benny hoists a man called Rickie out of his car, onto a wheelchair and up the ramp of the little white slatwood church that stands alone. 'Wherever there are churches,' says Benny, 'there were communities. Now they have gone'. The preacher is Brother Stevens, who looks a blend of Richie Havens and Rasputin, and the scripture for study tonight - after a prayer of invocation sung with passion and volume and interrupted with cries of 'Halleluiah! and 'Oh Yes!' - is the seventh chapter in the Book of Ecclesiastes. 'The heart of fools is in the house of pleasure... If you the poor are oppressed in a district / And justice and rights are denied / Do not be surprised by such things / For one official is eyed by a higher one / And over them both are others higher still'. </p> <p>Benny invites the meeting to recall Clinton's visit, and how 'many of us saw the motorcade go by - but is it any better now?' No, the company agrees. 'We can expect nobody to help us from outside,' says Benny, 'Look for change from within. From within yourself, and from within your community.' </p> <p>Not all of Benny Brown's reservations are black, of course. Many are Hispanic, along the border towns of Texas, Arizona and California, where squads of white vigilantes now take the law and their semi-automatic guns into their own hands. The native, first Americans occupy the dustiest and most comfortless acres of land to which they were dispatched a century and a half ago. And there are, in their way, white reservations too - in Appalachia and across the vast prairies and plains, but it is in the South and in particular the black South with its legacy of slavery and segregation (the Confederate flag is still proudly stitched into that of the state of Mississippi) that 'poverty pockets' are at their worst. There is a 'New South' to be sure: with its dynamic capital of Atlanta and a formidable Attorney General in Mississippi, Mike Moore, who is prising open the sealed secrets of crimes by the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and church burning in the 1960s, to win a string of convictions. </p> <p>But the depth of poverty in black Mississippi remains, frankly, shocking. The Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta has reported, in the past few months, serious clusters of diabetes, hepatitis and Aids around poor communities, where some 40 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line. </p> <p>Back in Jonestown, the night is young, and as it falls one realises that Benny and his fellow-churchgoers are engaged in a state of what is, for them, apocalyptic war. Down at the Club Sugar - a ramshackle brick cabin beside the railroad track - those parking cars are invited by the girls if they want to 'have a little fun tonight'. Lads like 'Q', with his blue bandanna, are arriving to drown their sorrows and thoughts in the barrage of rap music while his friend 'Icy Man', although in the middle of a conversation, pulls hard on a tube of 'rocks', his eyes glazing over, his face frozen in oblivion. Mayor Phillips had warned how 'the drug pushers have been pushed out of the bigger towns and are now targeting the little ones. And the more they come, the more we get break-ins, prostitution.' </p> <p>It's like finding the old Seventies Bronx in the middle of a twenty-first century cotton plantation and the crowd soon moves to a joint nearer the village centre, Hot Spot. We ask if we can take pictures of the heaving and dancing, to be told politely that this would be a 'bad idea because a lot of the guys here are wanted'. The guys accordingly hit the floor as the girls shake their stuff - only for the festivities to be abruptly brought to a close by the sudden and robust entry of a posse of (very white) police officers. 'They're serious,' says our host, Clee - who dislikes rap and who dreams mainly of setting up a blues band in town - 'they're not local, they're County'. </p> <p>On a street that runs adjacent to the Sunflower River through Clarksdale, there's a ramshackle but precious hotel with a history to tell that encapsulates all the pain and emotion of Benny Brown's 'poverty pocket'. The Riverside Hotel dates from the days when blacks were not allowed to stay in 'white' hotels; it is where singer Bessie Smith was taken to die; it's where the blues masters stayed and now where the labourers - the 'weeklies' - live, and where the blues pilgrims, mostly from overseas, come to visit. </p> <p>The joint is run by 'Rat' Cliffe, son of the lady who opened it and the wisest guy in town, now in his seventies. 'It's something like folks want to stay poor around here,' says Rat impatiently, working his spindly fingers around his cigarette end. 'Up there in Tunica they build casinos. But they wouldn't have 'em here - politics and the churches. In other places you got people wanting to work for themselves, like in Chicago, do something, get a sense of pride. But here, you know what has killed this place?' And here is a surprise from a man at the heart of the black community. 'Welfare. It stops people working. Why should a man go all the way to Tunica to work 40 hours a week and 10 hours travelling for $600 a month if he can get that from the welfare? Why go to work as a young woman when you can get paid just for having babies?' </p> <p>The sun is now low in the evening sky over the cotton fields outside Ruby Walker's home; the cats savouring the last of the heat. Ruby's grandparents were slaves working these cotton fields; 'And so was I, after a fashion,' she reflects. 'We worked from sun up to sundown, and the money was cheap.' Her daughter Mary became the fifth cotton-picking generation until she found work in a local school. But, adds Ruby, the furrows deepening across her brow: 'I sometimes wonder if they ever really did do away with slavery. I don't know what's happening round here no more. All I know is it was better in the Forties than it is now'.</p>",
  "As you reap, so shall you sow. For 21 years, first the Conservatives and now New Labour have aspired to deregulate, privatise, contract out and spend every tax pound as meanly as possible. The reasons the state once expanded - to ensure safety, to limit risk, to promote accountability, to assert a common interest - are all believed to be part of a redundant quasi-socialist worldview. Yet every day brings fresh evidence of the baleful results of this attitude to the public sector. <p>Last week another four rail travellers died in one of the developed world's least safe, most expensive and most unreliable rail systems - product of an ill-considered privatisation whose irrational structure New Labour refuses to reconsider. And the Government ploughs on, trying to prove it is really a surrogate Conservative party. It refuses to reconsider its plans for the partial privatisation of London Underground or the air traffic control system. It ponders how further to reduce the so-called burden of regulation. It shrinks from any compulsory assertion of the public interest. It presses ahead with the discredited private finance initiative. </p> <p>The public sector should not remain an island. It needs to form partnerships, alliances and networks with the private sector - and it needs to become more alert to efficiency. But it remains the custodian of important values which cannot be reasonably assumed by the private sector. There is a clash between profit maximisation and safety, as we are learning on the rail network. And private companies are not as ready as they need to be to accept the necessary requirements of accountability and openness when they operate in sensitive public interest areas such as transport, communications, health and education. </p> <p>Nobody with a grain of sense wants to return to a world of monolithic nationalised industries. But equally we need to ditch the absurd proposition that the only alternative is wholesale privatisation, contracting out and deregulation. There is a viable 'third way' with a proper place for public enterprise. Politicians should start by recognising that Britain can no longer continue with the current absurd rail structure inherited from privatisation. Track management and train operation needs re-integration. Safety needs to be understood and paid for. And the Government must direct and finance the construction of a cheap, efficient, integrated transport system, if necessary in partial public ownership. The private sector is good, often very good - but it is time to recognise its limits.</p>",
  "Cool Britannia is dead. Long live Ye Olde Englande. The land of fuddy duddy florals, lavender scent and leather-and-walnut is softening its stiff upper lip and speeding into the twenty-first century as the coolest place on the planet. <p>From frocks to cars, trench coats to teacups, and perfume to pens, the best of British is back. Heritage is hip and Margot Leadbetter checks and prints, Midlands-made motors and pukka bone china are the new black. </p> <p>Sales at Laura Ashley are up almost 20 per cent and the company is making money for the first time in four years. Daks, which was forced to sell its flagship Art Deco Piccadilly store two years ago, returned to Bond Street last week. </p> <p>London's Mayfair now boasts a revamped Aquascutum, Burberry, Alfred Dunhill, Austin Reed and the first bespoke Connolly leather-goods store. Savile Row has cast off its Little Lord Fauntleroy image with designers like Richard James and Oswald Boateng re-creating le style anglais . </p> <p>But it is not just clothes. Ten years ago the wheels had all but fallen off Britain's motor industry. Now some of England's best-loved motoring icons are revving their engines once more. No sooner had the last 1950s bone-shaker Mini rolled off the production line at Longbridge last week than the beefed-up luxury 'new Mini' was unveiled at the Birmingham Motorshow. </p> <p>In the 1960s the Inspector Morse Jaguar Mk II and E-type were the only ways to travel, but in the 1970s strikes nearly killed the cat. Now it's back. The Coventry-based company has achieved record sales this year, up a huge 80 per cent on last year following the launch of the S-Type. </p> <p>Americans are buying more Rolls-Royce cars and the number is set to increase when the company opens a new factory in Sussex. Bentley, the bulldog British motor, is back with some of the most stylish coupes and convertibles to have GB bolted on the boot. Sales are up 30 per cent. </p> <p>Morgan and Jensen are turning heads with stunning new two-seaters, the companies' first for a generation. Even James Bond is back where he belongs - behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Vanquish in his next movie. </p> <p>Once written off as too sandalwood stuffy for the sporty CK one generation, even Britain's tiny perfumiers are fragrant again. The smell of money at Jermyn Street's Floris and Creed has never been stronger. </p> <p>Smythson, the stiffest of stiff-card Bond Street stationers, is inviting in more customers than ever. Ali G creator Sacha Baron-Cohen uses their pens. Even pukka crockery maker Wedgwood is hot. Their new 'black and white' range is coming to a wedding list near you. </p> <p>Twenty years ago Burberry was for American tourists, Jaguar for second-hand car dealers and only your grandad wore Daks - the name itself is a mix of 'Dad' and 'Slacks'. Now anyone who is anyone, from Liam Gallagher to Prince William, is donning the beige check, paying the deposit for the F-type and slipping into Daks pumps. </p> <p>What has transformed the land of Marks &amp; Spencer pants, rosewater, kippers and kidneys into the epicentre of elegance? Smart continentals and Japanese started it when they began buying up 'Made in Britain' brands. Now a new generation of British designers is copying them copying us and giving the classics a witty, youthful twist. </p> <p>Burberry has started making bikinis, bandanas and dog bowls. Dunhill has ditched its dated gold and black for more sporty silver and rubber. Pringle has ironed out Nick Faldo in a diamond-pattern V-neck and signed up aristocrat model Honor Fraser. </p> <p>On the road Jaguar has abandoned boxy saloons and roared forward in curvy coupes. Mini is cutting deals with MTV, and Morgan has gone all Penelope Pitstop. As Timothy Everest, creative director of Daks, puts it: 'British heritage is respected worldwide, but it is an institution in need of modernisation.' </p> <p>Olde Englande has also benefited from a retail revolution. Consumers are richer than ever and are abandoning the high street for luxury marques. Martin Mason, of Pringle, says: 'There is so much throw-away fashion around. The consumer is willing to pay more for classics.' </p> <p>Old Thomas Burberry, Laura Ashley and Mini designer Alec Issigonis may be turning in their graves but, thanks to the young guns, Britain is back.</p>",
  "Drug users who fall behind with payments to their dealers are being targeted by a vicious new breed of gangster who purchases their debts and then uses extreme violence and intimidation to obtain payment. <p>The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) has expressed alarm at the trend which has resulted in serious injury and death over small amounts of money. </p> <p>In one case a man who owed his cannabis supplier \u00a350 was attacked by two strangers who punched him repeatedly, sprayed ammonia in his face then shot him in the leg. In other cases, businesses have been firebombed and house windows have been shot out in an attempt to intimidate the owners. A spate of shootings and stabbings in the north of England in recent weeks is being linked to drug debt enforcement and battles to control this lucrative new market. </p> <p>The gangs 'buy' debts by offering dealers an instant payment of around half the outstanding amount. They then pursue the debtor, claiming the full amount plus interest and 'expenses' that may amount to several times the sum owed. They can act with relative impunity as the debtors are reluctant to involve the police. </p> <p>Roger Gaspar, director of intelligence at NCIS, told The Observer: 'We are seeing the start of an alarming trend. It appears to be organised and there is often extreme violence, even though the amounts of money may be relatively small.' </p> <p>Debtors who are unable to raise money are forced to sell drugs themselves, sell their possessions or steal. </p> <p>Last month heroin addict Clifford Shepherd told Basildon Crown Court that he had been forced to burgle homes to pay off his drug debts. He said he was accompanied on his crime spree by a debt collector until his \u00a3800 drugs bill was paid off. The gang member would point out properties to be raided and Shepherd would hand over all the stolen items. He was jailed for four years. </p> <p>Last week former Brighton pub landlord Christopher Mayne was jailed for six years after a court heard he had been forced into making daily trips into the town centre to sell heroin and other drugs after falling behind with payments to his own dealer, who sold on his debt. </p> <p>A defence of acting under duress because of drug debts is becoming increasingly common at courts across the country. However, judges are reluctant to take such claims into account as, even where there is strong evidence of violence having been used, there is often little to support the defendant's version of events. </p> <p>When Raymond Griffith ran up debts of several thousand pounds to a gang in Newcastle, he arranged to repay the amount over several months. However, the debt was purchased by a gang of third-party enforcers and Griffith was told to travel to London and pick up \u00a3250,000 worth of Ecstasy tablets or be executed. Detectives from the National Crime Squad followed him and arrested him as he picked up the drugs in a pub at King's Cross station. Last week Griffith was jailed for seven years. </p> <p>In August, 18-year-old Brian Kinnear was jailed for eight years after carrying out a cowardly attack on 84-year-old Catherine McKenzie. He claimed he had been acting under duress in order to pay off a drug debt of just \u00a313. His victim died three days later. </p> <p>Last summer, 22-year-old Christopher Munro was jailed for four years after holding up a petrol station at gunpoint. He told the court he had been forced to commit the crime in order to repay a \u00a3800 drug debt. </p> <p>The use of third-party debt collectors is being blamed for an astonishing rise in the number of professional kidnappings - up by 500 per cent since last year. According to a police report, the drug debts are sold to gangs which specialise in kidnapping in an attempt to recoup their money. 'Such kidnaps are extremely violent with the hostage being starved, tied up, threatened, beaten and even murdered.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\">tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br><a href=\"http://www.ncis.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">National Criminal Intelligence Service</a></p>",
  "Hurrah, not before time, Tony Blair wants to be taken seriously as a green. On Tuesday, as we report today, the Prime Minister will make what might be the most significant environmental speech of his premiership. He will emphasise the apparently entirely beneficent nature of many green propositions. Businesses that put sustainability first are efficient businesses. Governments that put environmental diplomacy first, as in climate-control talks, forge new and important alliances. And being green does not mean consumers have to stop consuming; they simply spend in a more discerning way. <p>It is certainly a sunny view of the green cause. However, Mr Blair also seems to believe it is good politics. Noisy neighbours and polluted streets are just the local end of a continuum that extends to global warming, he will argue, and once the connection is recognised voters will reward governments prepared to take up green issues. He is backing his hunch with new money; \u00a3150 million for a new trust to promote technologies that reduce carbon emissions along with \u00a350m each for research into renewable energy and waste recycling. </p> <p>We welcome this long overdue conversion. But we hope Mr Blair has not settled on it because he has been wrongly persuaded that environmentalism is only about 'win-win' solutions that involve no hard choices, tough regulation or protests from special interest groups. The green cause is a natural fit for New Labour. But it requires initiatives on transport and the inner city that are expensive and possibly unpopular; it requires facing down business when it argues that environmental taxes will compromise competitiveness. Internationally, it means taking on the Americans, the world's environmental recalcitrants. </p> <p>Being green also means being tough and long-termist. We can only hope Mr Blair means what he says.</p>",
  "The track menders had come all the way to the rail depot in London on a minibus from Rotherham, leaving at 4am and arriving at dawn. A motley bunch of ex-miners, mechanics and taxi drivers, they are part of the new army of subcontractors that has sprung up to cash in on Britain's railway boom. <p>The men are employed by a tiny Yorkshire-based maintenance outfit. Balfour Beatty uses them to fix the tracks. Railtrack employs Balfour Beatty. The companies that run the trains rely on Railtrack to keep the track operational and their trains running on time. It is privatisation's version of the chain gang, a cascade of responsibility that spilt over last week as the danger that many have been warning about ever since the railway was parcelled into more than 100 pieces and sold off finally became a reality. </p> <p>Yawning in their woolly hats and orange safety vests, the men stubbed out their cigarettes and started to load rail-bashing tools onto a wagon in the grey light of Friday morning. 'We go where the work is and there's going to be lots now they are panicking about every little bump on the track. Lots of overtime - and Christmas is coming,' said an ex-taxi driver. He was pleased about that. </p> <p>An ex-miner was more sombre. Britain's crumbling rail system could not cope with the record traffic levels now thundering over it, he said. 'They are running the high-speed trains like shuttle services these days and the tracks are just not ready for it. And now they are diverting trains on to other bits of track that could be in an even worse state.' </p> <p>Twenty miles away at Hatfield, four carriages still lie on their side, one with its roof ripped off. They were once part of the 12.10pm train from King's Cross to Leeds. Now they are part of Britain's desperate railway history, the train that bounced off the track on Wednesday because of a broken rail that should have been replaced six months ago. Four people died. </p> <p>Yesterday, as the cranes began the grim process of removing the crumpled carriages which are still smeared with blood, the full extent of Britain's rail crisis was becoming clear. A consultant's report reveals that more than 2,000 miles of track are officially categorised as 'poor' or 'very poor'. </p> <p> </p> <p>Clearing up the crash site in Hertfordshire will take weeks. Trains which use the route, one of the busiest in Britain, are now taking up to an hour longer to get from London to Edinburgh. Nearly 100,000 people swamped the National Rail Inquiry helpline last week to find out what was going on. And every time there is a delay and Railtrack work is found to be the cause, the company faces a fine. </p> <p>And that is only the start of it. A train that was derailed near Stafford on Thursday was nowhere near one of the designated 'slow-down' areas. So other parts of the track are also clearly of concern. The public has looked on in bemusement as a torrent of astonishing facts has spilt out. Railtrack knew for months that there were problems with the track in the Hatfield area. Union sources said that train drivers had reported a syndrome of frequent 'rough rides' on that stretch of high speed line. Railtrack sent a letter to Balfour Beatty in April complaining of defects on the line that had not been rectified and 'could lead to a derailment'. A replacement piece of track had been lying beside the line waiting to be fitted since May because Railtrack is finding it increasingly difficult to persuade operators to cut back on the number of trains they run while it shuts the tracks. </p> <p>There was no speed restriction in force because a primary concern is getting the trains to run on time. If they don't, Railtrack faces huge fines. Such is the complexity of the present way of managing the railway. sorted out. </p> <p>At 7.30pm local time last Tuesday John Prescott's flight touched down in Chongking, a huge urban sprawl in south-east China during a ministerial visit. At 7.35pm his secure mobile phone rang. It was his office in London. There has been a train crash, Prescott was told. It looks bad. </p> <p>Arriving at his hotel, Prescott set up a conference call with Lord Macdonald, the Transport Minister. Macdonald told the Deputy Prime Minister that he was holding off visiting the site until it was clear exactly what had happened. Prescott agreed. </p> <p>But there was a problem. The next day most of the Cabinet would be in Glasgow for Donald Dewar's funeral. Macdonald was supposed to be there, leaving open the possibility that on one of the most important days for Britain's rail industry there would be no one to handle the crisis in London. Macdonald began plans to cancel his trip north. </p> <p>At 1am, 9pm in London, and with the certain knowledge that four people had died, Prescott spoke to the Prime Minister. Tony Blair had to be at Dewar's funeral and was then travelling to Seoul to make the important announcement that diplomatic links were to be restored with North Korea. Prescott would have to get back. </p> <p>At 5am on Thursday, Prescott's flight from Hong Kong touched down at Heathrow. By now the story was running away with itself. Gerald Corbett, the chief executive of Railtrack whose offer of resignation had been turned down, had told BBC's Newsnight that the railway system had been ripped apart by privatisation, and that the whole complicated structure should be slimmed down. </p> <p>Prescott was furious. Corbett appeared to be making rail policy on the hoof, laying himself out as the sacrificial lamb while forcing the Government's hand. The Deputy Prime Minister believes that the establishment of the Strategic Rail Authority gives the rail industry the co-ordination it needs. Closer cooperation, not the nightmare of ripping up the present licensing system and trying to start again, is the answer, Prescott has told officials. The next day Corbett rowed back, saying that everything should be considered and that it was time for the industry to start speaking with one voice. </p> <p>Prescott inherited a railway structure hopelessly compromised by privatisation. It was a Conservative idea pushed through by a Conservative Government. The sound of Tories running away from the scene of the crime was heard all week. </p> <p>When the BBC's Today programme last week tried to contact previous Transport Secretaries involved in putting together the legislation, including Malcolm Rifkind and John MacGregor, they were mysteriously unavailable. Margaret Thatcher has said nothing. John Major has said nothing. </p> <p>Sue MacGregor did manage to tackle Michael Portillo, the Shadow Chancellor, about his role when he appeared on Today on Friday morning to talk about the euro. 'You were a Minister,' she said, 'at the time when it was being pushed hard?' </p> <p>'No,' said Portillo, who has finally admitted, along with the Conservative transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin, that mistakes have been made. 'I was a junior minister long before the time of privatisation.' </p> <p>Listeners could have been mistaken for thinking that Portillo had nothing to do with privatisation. A check in Hansard, the record of Parliamentary debates, reveals that Portillo, when a Minister of State at the Department of Transport, announced in 1989 that he was 'considering the long-term options for British Rail, including privatisation'. </p> <p>He was also credited with sending the No 10 Policy Unit an outline of privatisation options for British Rail and London Underground before the 1992 election. When, later, he was at the Treasury he was responsible for attempting to reduce Government spending which became the driving factor behind the confusion of contracts and fines that Britain's railway was left with. </p> <p>McGregor, the Conservative MP for Norfolk South, was the Transport Secretary after the 1992 election who was responsible for pushing the legislation through Parliament. He was advised by Sir Christopher Foster, then a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who was convinced that vertical separation - different owners for the trains and the track - was the way forward. The Tories wanted a number of rail companies to encourage competition, efficiency and 'local responsiveness'. Most importantly, having a lot of train-operating franchises would increase Treasury revenue by enabling a series of lucrative sell-offs rather than a single large one. The fines system would ensure, MacGregor hoped, that passengers got a good deal because trains would run on time. Safety was not the priority. </p> <p>Sir Bob Reid was chairman of British Rail until 1995, the key years when privatisation was pushed through. Reid said he warned MacGregor after the 1992 election that tearing up the structure of BR, which kept track ownership and train operations under one umbrella in geographical zones, would make running the railways 'very difficult'. Reid said he told the Government it had taken up to 30 years for oil operations in the North Sea to change to a system of contracting out many of its activities. </p> <p>'I had no objection to getting private money into the railways,' he said. 'But I told them if they were trying to make this huge change of responsibility at what seemed like 48 hours' notice, there was no way they would have the quality of operation BR had. The advice was not heeded.' The only changes the Government made in response was to build in a lot more bureaucracy and complexity. </p> <p> Such a complex picture means that even superficially simple operations, like replacing trains, have become bogged down in contractual arguments. In railway sheds up and down the country more than 100 brand new trains are sitting unused because they have missed their delivery date from the manufacturers, have had to be withdrawn after teething problems or are awaiting long overdue safety certificates from Railtrack. Meanwhile millions of passengers are forced to squeeze on to old, and less safe, trains. </p> <p>Gwyneth Dunwoody, the chairwoman of the Transport Select Committee, told The Observer : 'There have been rows going on about maintenance costs, with Railtrack boasting about driving down overheads. They argue not about the quality of the work but about who is going to pay. That is very worrying.' </p> <p>Britain will now have an enforced period of slow-down as the Government and the railway industry finally grapple with problems built up over years. The men from Rotherham in their woolly hats will have a lot more work. And passengers will have a lot more irritation. Railtrack has finally realised that what cannot be countenanced, whatever the fines for delays and cancellations, is any more deaths. </p> <p><b>Five who pushed railways down the privatisation track</b></p> <p><b> John MacGregor </b></p> <p><b>Then: </b> Transport Secretary 1992-94.

  "The drug factory at the centre of the polio vaccine scandal has a history of contamination and production blunders, leading to fears that its vaccines against other diseases are unsafe. <p>The lives of thousands of old people and children have been put at risk by drug shortages caused by a catalogue of problems that have plagued the Medeva vaccines plant on Merseyside. One serious incident led to British soldiers being sent abroad without protection against Yellow Fever. </p> <p>Last year, investigators from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were horrified by the conditions they found at the plant in Speke, near Liverpool, which also makes vaccines against flu, tuberculosis, tetanus and Hepatitis B. </p> <p>On Friday, the Department of Health was forced to recall Medeva's oral polio vaccine after it was discovered that the firm had potentially been using BSE-infected material. </p> <p>This weekend, an investigation by The Observer can reveal that the problems surrounding the polio vaccine may prove to be the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>A week-long inspection by the FDA last summer into the production of the flu vaccine Fluvirin at the plant found Medeva had failed to: </p> <p>\u0095 'clean, maintain and sanitise equipment at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunction or contamination'; </p> <p>\u0095 maintain systems to prevent unacceptable levels of toxins and bacteria contaminating the production process; </p> <p>\u0095 ensure batches of vaccines 'conformed with all established standards, specifications and characteristics'; and </p> <p>\u0095 prove that vaccines on doctors' shelves would be free from 'bacteria and fungi'. </p> <p>Last October the FDA's director of compliance, Steven Masiello, fired off an official warning letter to Medeva's head of primary production, John O'Brian, telling him to sort out the problems or have its product banned from entering the US. Fluvirin is used by some 20 million Americans and more than a million British people, many of them elderly. </p> <p>Although the extent of the excess levels of toxins and bacteria at the Speke factory is not known, in extreme cases, contaminated vaccines can lead to severe adverse reactions, including toxic shock and fever. In the old and fragile, the impact could be lethal. </p> <p>The FDA letter, seen by The Observer , contains the disclosure that instead of dealing with the problems, managers at the plant wanted to raise the level of contamination deemed to be acceptable. </p> <p>Sources familiar with the company's operations claim that there were serious production problems running through the factory and abuses were routinely ignored. </p> <p>Although it is not known what other contamination problems the factory had, it is known that production difficulties were not confined solely to the manufacture of the flu vaccine. </p> <p> The Observer has learned that the company was forced to stop making its Yellow Fever vaccine Arilvax, leading to a widespread shortage throughout the country. The Ministry of Defence last night confirmed that the situation became so serious that earlier this year it sent British soldiers on overseas missions without protection against Yellow Fever. Many travellers were also unable to get vaccinated against the horrifying tropical disease, which attacks the stomach and kidneys. The company has still not restarted production. </p> <p>This March, The Observer revealed that production problems at the Medeva factory had led to warnings of a tuberculosis epidemic after the company failed to supply sufficient quantities of vaccine to health authorities. Three months after the FDA inspection the shortage of TB vaccines led to the suspension of routine school vaccinations. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat consumer affairs spokesman Norman Baker is now calling for an immediate investigation into events at the Speke factory and a full explanation from the Department of Health. </p> <p>He also said that the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the body which regulates drug companies, had serious questions to answer about why it had failed to take any action. </p> <p>Baker said: 'The Department of Health and the MCA have completely failed to act in the interests of public health. </p> <p>'In their desperate attempts not to undermine the vaccination programme, they have tried to sweep all problems under the carpet. As a result, public confidence has been shattered. </p> <p>'When will they learn that the answer is not to cover up, but to identify problems and deal with them immediately?' </p> <p>The Medicines Control Agency refused to answer any questions posed by The Observer about Medeva's vaccines and production at the Merseyside factory. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: 'The MCA would not have allowed vaccines to be produced at this factory unless it was sure it was safe.' </p> <p>The troubled Speke plant has changed hands twice over the past year. When the problems were first identified by the FDA, it was owned by Medeva Pharma, which was bought by Celltech in January. Just last month, the vaccine business was sold on to Oxford-based Powderject and is now called Evans Vaccines. </p> <p>A spokesman for Powderject said the company had first looked at buying the business last year, but pulled out after reading the FDA report. After receiving reassurances that the problems had been resolved it went ahead with the purchase: \u00a356 million has been spent on improvements and the management team has been changed, although a number of senior personnel remain with the firm. </p> <p>The FDA confirmed that it had not reinspected the plant since its October warning letter, but was satisfied that problems were now being dealt with. It has authorised the import of the flu vaccine this year. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: 'The FDA would not allow this vaccine to enter the country if it was not safe.'</p>",
  "The old Palestinian woman, her head wrapped in a scarf, scuttled from behind a corner and made a run for the barricade by Bethlehem's Rachel's Tomb - a flashpoint in three weeks of rioting. Ducking under a hail of stones and dodging Israeli sniper fire, she weaved among the stone-throwing youth of the shabab to bring bottled water to thirsty Palestinian boys on the frontline. <p>Around the corner and out of sight, Palestinian taxis are ferrying in large chunks of rock from the surrounding hills. It is women, sitting together on the ground, who smash the rocks into ammunition for their husbands and sons. </p> <p>The images of the past three weeks have shown one side of the violence: a male world of confrontation on the streets, in the olive groves and the funeral crowds. As the media feeds these images to the world, the question arises: 'Where are the women?' </p> <p>In Jerusalem's Mokassed Islamic Charitable hospital, on the Mount of Olives, overlooking the Old City, Najah il Khatib, 42, is standing by her son's bedside. Zahran, 13, was participating in a riot that broke out in their village outside Jerusalem. 'We were sitting at home having lunch,' she says, 'when we got word that Israeli soldiers were surrounding our village. My son jumped up immediately from the table and ran out on to the street. I tried to block him as he went out the door but it was too late,' she sighs. </p> <p>The next time she saw her son he was in hospital. A high-velocity bullet bounced off a nearby rock and ricocheted to hit him in the chest. </p> <p>For Najah, her son is a hero. 'He's a fighter. If I could go out on the streets and demonstrate myself I would,' she says, 'but it's not my place. It's not in accordance with our religion. Girls just don't go out on the street like that with boys.' </p> <p>When riots break out in her village, the women stay inside with the younger children and gather around their satellite TVs to learn what is happening in the outside world. </p> <p>Further down the hospital corridor in the Intensive Care Unit, a 13-year-old boy Mohammed Jodah lies in bed motionless. A bullet fired by an Israeli soldier slammed into his brain and has left him completely paralysed in the right-hand side of his body. His mother, Miriam, 34, has no brave words to say. She is left, like so many women in this struggle, to pick up the shattered pieces of her loved ones' lives. </p> <p>'My children never participate in demonstrations,' she says. 'I don't allow them,' she says. But Miriam's son sneaked out of his house and went to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City. He was headed towards the most combustible, disputed 35-acre area known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Haram al Sharif to Muslims. </p> <p>'It was out of curiosity, perhaps, that he defied me and made the journey to the mosque that day,' Miriam says, 'but he is not the adventurous type.' </p> <p>Clashes broke out between the Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, and her son received a rubber-coated bullet in the head. To date the death of 12 minors - under the age of 17 - has been recorded in what is being called the Aqsa Intifada, the uprising of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. </p> <p>Israelis have accused Palestinian leaders of inciting violence at the mosques, and believe that textbooks have brainwashed Palestinian students with stories of martyrs who sacrifice themselves to kill Jews. But looking now at her son, his left eye rolling in its socket occasionally, Miriam has no desire to participate in or contribute to any struggle. </p> <p>'If any of my other children tried to go out on the street to demonstrate I'd try and stop them too,' she says. 'Sometimes they say it is be-cause God loves him that he takes my son and sometimes they say it is destiny. But my child is only 13 years old. Surely it is nobody's destiny to die like this.' </p> <p>In Nazareth, north of Jerusalem, Nabila Espagnoly, a 45-year-old Palestinian psychologist, believes the poor economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has kept traditional women in the home. 'Women are out there on the streets holding peaceful demonstrations, but \"peaceful demonstrations\" are not of any interest to the media. That is why you rarely see women activists on your television set. But the day a woman picks up stones, the world will sit up and notice.' </p> <p>Jewish women, right or left-wing, are no less active. But these groups continue to demonstrate in the shade, far away from the eye of the cameras. Peace activist Hana Safran, 50, is a PhD student at the Haifa University. She is also a member of 'Women in Black', a group, which, she says, promotes living in peace with its Arab neighbour. </p> <p>'We were protesting against the Israeli army and the manner in which it shoots at young Palestinian children,' Safran recalls, 'but the Israeli TV channels are not interested. They come to the scene, look at us, and then search desperately for something more dramatic to film. It looks like one must resort to violence to get the world's attention. But that would be tantamount to shooting ourselves in the foot, would it not?' she smiles. </p> <p>Demonstrating against the actions of the Israeli army means she is also challenging her son, who has enrolled in the army, which she finds very hard to bear. 'I told my son that I didn't bring him into this world to give him to any war - but now that he has joined I feel it is my responsibility, my moral duty, to share my political feelings with him.'</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "Observers believe the beginning of the end of President Robert Mugabe's hold on power has begun but fear the country will pay a high price in chaos and blood before he relinquishes it. <p>The anti-government riots which rocked Harare for three days last week were only a hint of things to come. No fatalities were recorded and there was limited property damage. In fact, the worst violence appears to have been that inflicted by the police and the army after the riots had stopped. </p> <p>But most striking and significant was the bitter antipathy shown by the demonstrators toward Zimbabwe's leader. 'We hate Mugabe,' shouted one young rioter, shortly after throwing a rock at a police van. 'If he wants to be a person who is respected in his grave, then he must resign now. He has not been a good leader, especially economically. We want him out by the end of the year.' </p> <p>'No, no, he must go sooner than that. He must be out by the end of this month. We are going to keep this up until he goes,' shouted another young man, before a cloud of tear gas sent us all running in different directions. </p> <p>Inflation of more than 60 per cent, unemployment of more than 50 per cent and growing by the day, chronic shortages of fuel, a distant and expensive war, and an increasingly repressive and violent police force all add to Mugabe's palpable unpopularity. Last week 30 per cent increases in the price of bread, sugar and bus fares sparked the protests. </p> <p>'The riots showed the people's disgust for this regime. It was Round One of the troubles this country must endure to rid itself of Mugabe,' said political science lecturer John Makumbe. </p> <p>'Round Two will come soon with the mass protest proposed by the MDC [the Movement for Democratic Change], which will be a national strike. That could be very significant. If it is well organised it could bring in every issue that people are concerned about: the high cost of living, corruption, the erosion of the rule of law, the Congo war, repression - everything. But even that will probably still be a preliminary round. </p> <p>'Round Three - that is not so easy to predict. What kind of civil disobedience the population will take to bring him down is anybody's guess. But I fear it will be bloody.' </p> <p>Unlike the demonstrators, Makumbe does not believe Mugabe will be forced out by Christmas. 'That is wishful thinking. Mugabe will not go without a major fight. The pressure on him must build and build. I don't think the pressure will become unbearable by Christmas. But I definitely think Mugabe will not be able to stay in office until his term expires in 2002. He will go down fighting and I fear he will take heaps of blood with him.' </p> <p>Certainly the Zimbabwe army acted like a brutal occupying force when it was sent to quell last week's disturbances. Tear gas bombs were dropped from helicopters over whole neighbourhoods. Troops went from door to door, dragging out and beating people of all ages. </p> <p>The government is benefiting from the town planning of Ian Smith's regime, which placed black townships miles away from the centre of the capital. They can be easily sealed off, leaving rioters with little to do but destroy their own neighbourhoods. </p> <p>The MDC showed consider able restraint last week by not trying to take advantage of what were clearly spontaneous riots. Instead the party is concentrating its efforts on introducing a parliamentary motion to impeach Mugabe. </p> <p>'The MDC must do every thing it can in parliament,' said Makumbe. 'It must raise questions about who killed who. It must raise so many questions about Mugabe's rule that it will be difficult for him to visit any foreign country. Everything that can be dragged up as a skeleton on Mugabe and his underlings must be dragged up. </p> <p>'This is the first time we have a democratic parliament with a significant opposition. It must hold Mugabe and his cronies accountable. Incrementally, bit by bit, this will erode Mugabe's authority and build animosity to his rule.' </p> <p>MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai called Robert Mugabe 'the Milosevic of Africa' and many are predicting that 'Bobodan' Mugabe will be the next dictator to fall. But Makumbe disagrees. 'I think Milosevic was a better tactician, he knew when to step down. </p> <p>'The population has already signalled it is going to rise up and force Mugabe out, but he is not listening.'</p>",
  "<p>Last autumn, one of my neighbours, Kenneth Payne, fortified by the courage available at one of our local bars, loaded his shotgun, walked across the road to the trailer home of best buddy Curtis Cook and emptied both barrels into Cook's stomach. </p> <p>While his friend bled to death, Kenneth sat down on his porch and telephoned a local family to say 'no one's going to bother your little girl anymore'. Kenneth claimed that Curtis had, earlier in the evening, confessed to molesting the neighbour's eight-year-old child.</p> <p>The next day, our town's burghers ran out to tell curious metropolitan reporters 'things like that don't happen here'. Really? No local mentioned the story of our school headmaster's daughter, who hid her pregnancy from her parents then drowned her child right after it's birth.</p> <p>What kind of monstrous hamlet do I live in? While few Americans have heard of it, you probably know it as the congenial, rural town lionised on BBC radio's Letter from America, broadcast by Alistair Cooke, one of our few unarmed residents.</p> <p>Like Alistair, I have made shameless use of the cartoon imagery of this convenient exemplar of unspoilt small town America. A few months ago, I wrote of our town's heroic struggle to block McDonald's opening a restaurant, a threat to our quaint rural character. The way I told it, we were gloriously defeated by the McLawyers who bullied us into bending our preservation laws.</p> <p>I left out of the story the fact that our defence was sabotaged from within by some members of that fifth column of small businessmen found in every American town - the local real estate agents, shopkeepers and farmers who hoped to turn a quick buck on their properties once the planning rules were breached and broken.</p> <p>I've written scores of bad-tempered columns about the brutish ways of America's biggest businesses. That viewpoint is admittedly a bit unbalanced. To be fair, we must recognise that for sheer narrow-minded, corrosive greed nothing can beat the USA's grasping, whingeing small businessmen. </p> <p>And within that avaricious little pack, none are so poisonously self-centred and incorrigible as the small town businessmen of rural America.</p> <p>During the presidential debates, Al Gore opened the bidding to win this pampered demographic by promising to slash inheritance taxes 'to save our family farms and businesses'. Right now, if you inherit a farm or business worth up to $2.6 million (\u00a31.8 million) you pay no tax at all. But that's just not enough for what the fawning candidates call 'local entrepreneurs'. Gore promised to raise the exemption to $4 million - only to be trumped by George W Bush, who would wipe away inheritance taxes altogether.</p> <p>This group is the same that defeated Bill and Hillary Clinton's 1993 proposal to require all businesses to provide bare-bones health insurance for their employees, an expenditure of only 35 cents (23p) per hour. </p> <p>Fortune 500 corporations expressed few qualms about the mandatory insurance plan as most big firms already provide some health care coverage for their employees. It was the swarm of Lilliputian entrepreneurs, under the aegis of their National Federation of Independent Businesses, who blocked the Clintons' modest attempt to end medical care apartheid in America.</p> <p>You name it - maternity leave, minimum wage, even health and safety inspections and rules barring racism in hiring - any meagre proposal to protect the lives and families of working people, and the NFIB's small businesses legions have their swords out.</p> <p>But we must never say so. Gore can shoot at big tobacco and big oil, Bush can vilify teachers and union workers, but any politician who breathes a word against rural businesses, farmers or the NFIB's Scrooge battalions ends up as electoral roadkill.</p> <p>Ten years ago, our town convinced a charitable foundation to pay for experts from Britain to tell us how to preserve our area's rural character. We held meetings, referenda, elections. It was that active small town American democracy that makes the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland ga-ga with envy. At the end, the town voted overwhelmingly to adopt what became known as the UK Stewardship Plan to protect our green fields and prevent ugly sprawl.</p> <p>Come by my town today and count the pustules of strip malls and fluorescent signs directing you to Bagels Hot, Cars Like New No Down-Payment, and Dog Burger where corn fields once stood. </p> <p>Sensible British designs and a preservation-minded electorate could not overcome the me-first obstructionism of a hard core of small businessmen and farmers lusting to sell off their land to McDonald's, Wal-Mart and housing speculators.</p> <p>I wouldn't equate rural shotgun murders and child molesting with the small town businessman's penchant for despoiling the rural landscape. But they are covered over by the same cowardly silence. No politician, local or national, has the guts to break though the mythology of the struggling local businessman who cares and sacrifices for his community. This folkloric invention approaches saintliness when the discussion turns to rural, small town America with its treacly images of barbershop quartets, Farmer Brown on his tractor and the Main Street parade after the strawberry harvest.</p> <p>What makes challenging this myth of happy small-town America off-limits is that it provides pleasant code words for the ugliest corner of the American psyche. </p> <p>When politicians talk about 'small-town American values', 'family values' and the 'hard-working small businessman' everyone knows the colour of that town, that family and that businessman: white.</p> <p>Pleasantville USA is implicitly placed against the urban jungle populated at the bottom by dark-skinned muggers and pregnant teenagers on the dole, and at the top by Jewish financiers of Hollywood pornography.</p> <p>It would dangerously undermine this politically useful imagery if the public were reminded that small towns are filled with pale-faced citizens despairing and dangerous as any in the inner cities. </p> <p>Nor could the NFIB win those special exemptions from taxes and planning regulations for small business and farms if they were not seen as struggling defenders of local communities but dollar-crazed and duplicitous operators who wouldn't care if McDonald's put a drive-though in the Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>Britain is not exempt from the political bullying power of small-town commercial cliques. It was sick-making to read of the Department of Environment's proposal to remove 80 per cent of England and Wales from the Areas of Special Control of Advertising which, until now, protected the countryside from billboards. This is the first step in the Government's loosening of rural planning strictures.</p> <p>The DETR's advisory quango, the Countryside Agency, last week dismissed preservationists fears as 'a nostalgic yearning for a countryside that is long gone. You need to look forward if the countryside is to have vitality in the future'. </p> <p>What is this 'future' that is so wonderful that you have to rush there at high speed, that requires billboards for Toys R' Us? I've seen your future. It's called America. I live there, among Taco Bell and Happy Meals.</p> <p>Every landscape we build, wrote psychologist Norman O Brown, is our recreation of the interior of our mothers' bodies. What does it say about Americans that when we look out over a natural vista we are seized with psychic anguish if we cannot locate a throbbing neon sign flashing Pizza hot!</p> <p>And what makes that vision so irresistible to John Prescott and his sub-ministers? In our little town, it was George, the owner of the local lumber yard, who proudly organised successful business opposition to the UK Stewardship plan. With dollar signs in his eyes, he welcomed the McDonald's and the boxy shopping mall that replaced several hundred acres of raspberry fields.</p> <p>But small-town Georges forget that when they break down government regulations, it is big business that gleefully rushes through the breach. </p> <p>This month, George was stunned by the announcement that Home Depot, the Wal-Mart of DIY stores, would replace a nearby corn field. And that means George is out of business. In small-town, neighbourly manner, I expressed my sympathy to George. If I were a better person, I would have meant it.</p>",
  "'Young British Muslims are being trained to make bombs and use Kalashnikov rifles to fight in a jihad - holy war - in Israel. The first 'Mujahideen' fighters, trained in military-style camps around Britain, flew out this month for Lebanon and Jordan. <p>At a secret location in a technology park in north London, three men in their mid-twenties told The Observer that it was their duty to fight the Israelis. </p> <p>Anyone in Britain who supported the state of Israel and companies such as Marks and Spencer, which had connections with Israel, were also legitimate targets, they said. </p> <p>The men will leave for the Middle East as soon as they can arrange visas. These Islamic warriors, who are known only by their noms de guerre, Abu Yahya, Abu Izzadeen and Abu al-Mujahid, have been schooled in the Koran and believe that the holy verses told them to fight against the occupation of Arab lands. </p> <p>'When we see what is happening in Palestine, it's not a matter of choice, it's a matter of obligation,' said 23-year-old Abu al-Muhajid. 'I have chosen to go and fight to fulfil that obligation and hopefully reap the highest rewards.' He said he had been trained to use a range of arms, including Kalashnikovs. </p> <p>Abu Izzadeen, a 25-year-old black Muslim convert, said: 'I have been with the Islamic movement since the day I embraced Islam, eight years ago, and I am willing to die for it.' </p> <p>He said that he had been trained in Britain, but also in the Islamic camps in Pakistan: 'In Islam, when we say training, we mean military training. The camps inside the UK prepare people with physical training and martial arts, and if they can obtain weapons they use them for training. </p> <p>'When we talk about jihad, we are not talking about harsh words, we are talking about training in bomb-making and strategy.' </p> <p>He added that, although he had no argument with individual British Jews, those who supported Israel were a legitimate target, as were companies with Israeli connections, such as Marks and Spencer, and the Jewish Chronicle newspaper. 'If someone supports a government which kills and rapes and murders, then you have a responsibility for it.' </p> <p>Abu Yahya, also 25, went further: 'We don't have a problem with Christians and Jews, it is only with people who occupy our lands. We have a problem with oppression. That is, with the Hindus in Kashmir, the Russians in Chechnya, the Christians in the former Yugoslavia and the Israelis in Palestine.' </p> <p>To illustrate, he quoted a verse of the Koran: 'Fight together those who fight you together.' </p> <p>A spokesman for Maddad Security Services, which is organising the recruitment, said the process was a closely guarded secret: anti-terrorism legislation now makes it an offence in Britain to conspire to commit terrorist acts abroad. The legislation was introduced by Home Secretary Jack Straw after pressure from Arab governments who claim that Britain has become a haven for Islamic extremists. </p> <p>The spokesman said: 'Emotions are running very high at the moment and it should be no surprise that people are volunteering for the jihad.' </p> <p>The Jewish Chronicle has been in a state of high alert since the increase in tensions in the Middle East, but there have been no direct threats to the newpaper. </p> <p>A spokesman from Marks and Spencer said that it was a publicly owned company that no longer had any special links with Israel. He said the company traded with Jordan, Egypt and Morocco as well as Israel. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the aftermath of the old economy. In the race between Europe's new 'just-in-time, 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week' super-states, we are in danger of losing our ability to manage the expectations of an increasingly wired society. Technology can help fulfil our ambitions, but it doesn't do much for people who can't afford ambition. </p> <p>A warning comes from the heart of the internet revolution, the US. A Gartner Group report has found that a whole generation of up to 50 million Americans could become 'functionally illiterate' in the future due to a lack of knowledge of, or access to, the internet. </p> <p>Gartner found that just 35 per cent of adults in the lower-socio-economic-status bracket had internet access, compared with 53 per cent in the lower-middle, 79 per cent in the upper-middle, and 83 per cent in the top bracket. </p> <p>The report identified three digital divides: access to the internet; a skills gap between those who know how to benefit from the internet and those who don't; and speed of access to the internet. </p> <p>As the posturing over cheap, unmetered internet access continues, and the availability of broadband (ADSL &amp; cable) increases, a danger exists that this third divide - between those with high-speed access and those without - may leave non-metropolitan areas disadvantaged. </p> <p>In many respects this threat mirrors the socio-economic gaps in PC ownership today and raises the unacceptable prospect of second-class access to the information super-highway. In Brit-ain, where a quarter of homes are believed to have access to the internet, one can sit comfortably inside the well-connected embrace of the M25 and imagine the benefits of the new dot-communism reaching equally in all directions. But look less than a hundred miles into the South East, as far as Margate perhaps, and the gap between new- and old-economy imagination and aspiration starts to resemble a chasm. </p> <p>Where does one draw the line between one industrial era and another? Is the criterion for an advanced information society really as simple as counting the number of electronic messages that pass between individuals and companies? According to the latest government-sponsored survey, 27 per cent of UK businesses are now using the internet. Scotland leads, with 29 per cent of companies trading online. But compare these figures with private-sector research. Although Ministers claim that the UK is on a par with Germany, the US and Sweden, PricewaterhouseCoopers recently announced that Germany was leading Europe in online transactions. </p> <p>Uncomfortable facts of early twenty-first century life are that we live in a time of profound and complex change in a global economy constantly pursuing the highest profits and lowest transaction costs and that the remains of our manufacturing base is increasingly moving overseas. Unskilled Indonesians may pack processors for a few dollars a day, but a skilled European information worker can command more than \u00a350,000 a year. Between these two extremes, and in every industrial society, there are populations who are too poor and unskilled to share in the new affluence; whose opportunities are increasingly restricted by economic and political forces outside their control. </p> <p>Throughout Europe, governments are anticipating a long-term devastation of the retail and public sector workforce caused by 'disintermediation': the elimination of the middleman by the arrival of the 'just-in-time' forces of information and communications technology (ICT). But the forces of progress carry the seeds of their own acute skills crisis. No single nation has a large enough pool of information-literate workers available to sustain the rapid growth in the global networked economy. </p> <p>The Institute of Directors has 50,000 members from across the old and new economy spectrum. For many, commercial ambition is increasingly constrained by the people factor. While optimism remains high, ICT employment costs are spiralling, and in the absence of a silicon-savvy workforce any vision of economic utopia appears increasingly distant. Understandably, Professor Jim Norton, the IoD's director of e-business development, believes human capital is our ultimate resource. 'Bridging the digital divide and enfranchising all of our population in the e-economy must be the Government's top priority,' he says. </p> <p>In the race to wire UK society into the internet, the Government has a vision, a budget and an initiative. The UK Online project, directed by Department for Education and Employment Minister Michael Wills, has set itself the ambitious target of full digital emancipation within five years. A new research centre is to be created to investigate the impact of new technology and will lead the efforts to end the so-called digital divide before it becomes a problem of acute social exclusion. </p> <p>Facing the prospect of a lost generation, how do governments plan to re-engineer the workforce to meet the demands of a global networked economy? </p> <p>Wills sees the UK Online project meeting the challenge, with two core priorities. 'First, the internet revolution isn't happening for everyone. Every person has the right to access and participate in these technologies. Second, we need to make sure that we have the right skills base. Alongside this comes another range of priorities; the right use of ICT in schools and communities. In the medium to long term, we have to close the skills gap in society. In the short term, and like every OECD country, we have a shortage of people with the right skills, and we have to tackle this head on and in a variety of ways.' </p> <p>In Wills' opinion: the principal challenges that governments need to address urgently are hardware, software and connectivity. 'The danger of a \"third-divide\" appearing is enormously important, which is why we are encouraging the widest kind of competition from telecommunications carriers. While we have a quite well developed cable industry, government needs to immediately target the danger of rural deprivation, and we wish to find innovative ways of reaching disadvantage and deprivation. The truth is that in 20 years we will have got there - but we have to get there quicker than that.' </p> <p>While nobody would doubt that the Prime Minister's own commitmentto rapid action, investment and education are a vital first step in devising a strategy to address a growing skills deficit, there is a harsher macro-economic big picture to consider. Do we in Europe have, like the Americans, a lost generation of our own, a thirtysomething workforce intel lectually and emotionally unprepared for the changes and challenges ahead? </p> <p>The new 'knowledge economy' will be a harsh environment for the common man. While a universal grasp of and access to ICT will emancipate more people in the device space of the web, one must question whether UK Online can deliver a central part of its vision in time. Can it swiftly produce the army of skilled and educated experts required to run tomorrow's new economy today?</p>",
  "<p>If ever you hanker after a half-assed exploration of internet issues, then tune in to that great flagship of BBC news and current affairs, Radio 4's Today programme. True, the ageing journalistic toffs who present it do not often engage in discussion of the net, but when they do they invariably take a firm grip of the wrong end of the stick. </p> <p>Last Wednesday morning they turned their attention to the oft-visited question of paedophiles on the net. The item opened with a report on the dangers to children posed by internet 'chat-rooms' - virtual spaces in which people exchange text or voice messages in real time. A representative of Childnet, an internet-based charity, ex-plained how one could highlight an individual participant in a chat room and invite that person to join in a private discussion. This, he argued, is where the danger lay. 'In chat rooms,' he went on, 'it's so much easier for someone to build a relationship with a child over a period of months, so in terms of strangers actually contacting children and harming them we've got to recognise that internet chat is the new playground where this is going to happen.' </p> <p>The reporter then interviewed the mother of a girl who had been picked out in this way by a 47-year-old man masquerading in cyberspace as a teenager and who had arranged a meeting (in real space) with her daughter. The point of the report was that this kind of thing is not illegal under UK law - but is in the US, where authorities do not have to wait until a child has actually been hurt before tak ing action. There then followed a hand-wringing discussion with a British police officer about the difficulties of preventing this kind of thing over here. 'There's real concern,' concluded the report, 'that British law and policing methods may be inadequate to meet the coming danger'. </p> <p>All of which is true, but mostly beside the point. What was missing from the Today item - and indeed is missing from discussions of internet issues in the mass media generally - is any acknowledgment that by far the best way to protect your children from the dangers that lurk on the net is carefully to monitor what they do online, and to engage with them in discussing the dangers. Most of us warn our kids not to accept lifts or sweets from strangers. But how many give warnings about not accepting invitations to private internet chats or disclosing personal details to online contacts? </p> <p>I suspect that many parents (and teachers) avoid doing this, probably out of fear of revealing their technological ignorance and suffering the loss of face this might entail. An increasing number put their faith - misguidedly - in software, by installing filtering programs which detect flesh tones, ban access to certain sites and so on. But these programs raise almost as many problems as they solve: computer-savvy kids find them easy to circumvent, for one thing; and they clumsily ban good sites as well as evil ones. But their greatest flaw is that they enable one to subcontract to a piece of software a fundamental parental responsibility - that of helping one's children to become street-wise in cyberspace. </p> <p>In the brain-dead mindset of the Today programme this is apparently a job that has to be subcontracted to software, the police or some national cybercrime intelligence unit. This is hooey. It's a job for parents and it's dead simple to do: put the PC in the living room where you can keep an eye on it; do not allow your kids to install chat or other software without your knowledge and approval; and talk to them about not accepting virtual sweets from virtual strangers. </p> <p><a href=\"mailton:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Like many women, my only real objection to gold-digging is that it looks like such hard work. Before you know it, your life would become a tape-loop of Aerosmith's 'Walk This Way' ('Talk this way!'), or one of those tacky Robert Palmer videos, where all the women get to strut around looking 'haughty' and 'dominant' in short skirts and stilettos. All that and having to be textbook 'sex-ee', and 'nice to be with' (read passive, uncomplaining, adoring), too. It would stretch the patience of any right-thinking woman to the limit. And for what? Jewels that make you shudder; scratchy underwear you'd only wear in a power cut, and dinners in fancy restaurants, listening to some \u00fcbersuit bore on about how great he is. </p> <p>I don't think I've ever been that hungry. </p> <p>Saying that, when done right, there's clearly an art, an arithmetic, to gold-digging - money is the objective, but sexuality is the key. Once upon a time, the colourful Courtney Love sat opposite me in a hotel room, grabbed her crotch and yelled: 'Women have so much power here if they only knew it.' But then, Courtney is smart enough to know that 'here' retains its potency only when it cannot be bought, either literally or metaphorically. Once a woman is 'for sale' on any level, she not only loses the power of 'here', she loses the greatest human right of all - emotional autonomy. That's why gold-diggers, even when they're as amusing and irresistible as Anna Nicole Smith, always remind me of mannequins in a department store window - beautiful and desirable, but also strangely powerless - inanimate, until posed, by hands seen and unseen. </p> <p>Two people were 'for sale' in very different ways this week. One, Ben Way, is a young man, just starting out in life, the other is the 'notorious' Bienvenida n\u00e9e Buck, a woman seemingly still determined only to leave the rich man's playpen, toes up, in a jewel-lined casket. To their credit, both these people were honest about their price tags, past and present. A year ago, at 19, Way, an internet high-flyer, was offered a multi-million pound contract to develop a new search engine. The drawback was that he was also required to sign away his right to drink, stay out late and dress outlandishly. Predictably, perhaps, what really caught the media eye was that he was also required to abstain from sexual relations for several months, when he met a girl, and only then after his bosses had vetted his intended. Way didn't care for this clause, but he signed regardless. </p> <p>By doing so, Way became someone who was willing to have no sex for money. A hooker in reverse if you like - a completely new kind of corporate-inspired male gold-digger. Bienvenida, who started out poor, is your more traditional GD. Like all women who make a living claiming that they know what makes men tick, and how to keep them happy, she obviously hates sex with an unbridled passion. To her, men, are just wallets with legs, human doors to a better existence, sugar daddies you suck like lollipops, until only the stick is left, and you have to trudge back to the billionaire candy store for more. </p> <p>According to Bienvenida, women too often let their emotions get in the way - we should all be treating relationships as business transactions, she yaps, like Ivana Trump-meets-Jane-Austen. In unguarded moments, Bienvenida admits she prefers dogs to men (there's a difference?), and bristles at the implication that she is exchanging sex for money in the time-honoured fashion. 'I use my mind, not my body,' she says, adding, 'No man who is successful invests his time with a loser. For that, they go to prostitutes.' Way appeared less bullish, admitting that he didn't feel good about his decision ('I missed out on all the things that make life at 19 worthwhile.') Then again, he is finding \u00a325m quite handy, and claims to have learnt something: 'Business is my big love,' he heavy-breathes. 'My babe.'</p> <p>It's too easy to sneer. Everybody has a price, and, for some of us, it's getting lower all the time. However, what is interesting here is how neither Bienvenida or Way accept how any equation featuring sex and money invariably leads to some form of prostitution. Then again, maybe the similarity of their situations is less interesting than their difference. On the one hand, you have a young man who has been richly renumerated for repressing a sexuality which undoubtedly exists, on the other, you have a woman who has been rewarded for promoting a sexuality which probably doesn't. Both are gold-diggers but Bienvenida emerges as the stocking-clad 'female' throwback, while Way may just be the 'male' future - hinting at the dawning of a new age where corporations control every aspect of our behaviour from the bedroom to the boardroom. As with dinners with boring rich guys, it's all seems to boil down to how 'hungry' you decide you are.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The gaffe by Willem Duisenberg over exchange rate policy reminds me of one of the great business quotes of recent decades. It was made by none other than the boss of the Dome - no, not that Dome, but the president of the failed Dome Petroleum Corporation of Canada in the early 1980s. </p> <p>What Bill Richards disarmingly said to former Financial Times journalist Peter Foster was: 'We weren't really successful in exploration, but the important thing is that we did it with other people's money.' </p> <p>As Foster tells the story, Richards immediately paused and added: 'Hey, that's not a very good quote, is it?' To which Foster replied 'It's a very good quote', and made it the title of a best-selling book on one of the great financial follies of the 1980s. </p> <p>The Times journalists who interviewed the president of the European Central Bank last week got a remarkable reply to the question whether it would make sense for central banks to get into the market if a sharp change in currencies were caused by war in the Middle East: 'I wouldn't think so,' was the quote. </p> <p>Duisenberg has a first-class press adviser, Manfred Korber, who spent many years at the Bundesbank and knows all about the sensitivities of the financial markets. As the Times reported: 'His press adviser, acutely aware of the potential market significance of the president's remarks on intervention, asked Duisenberg if he was happy for these comments to remain on the record. The ECB president replied that he was.' </p> <p>Then, of course, all hell broke loose. The financial markets had been impressed by last month's intervention by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to prop up the euro, and were waiting for more. The September intervention may not have sent the euro shooting up for long, but it steadied the currency. The fact that the G7 had shown they were prepared to intervene undoubtedly improved the climate around the euro. </p> <p>The ECB president was widely criticised for having broken the code under which central bank governors do not answer questions about intervention policy. In my experience, however, they, and finance ministers, do so when it suits them. The real gaffe was to give the impression that that was that - no more intervention on the cards. </p> <p>Despite the embarrassment he has caused, Duisenberg is the best ECB president we have; it is generally thought that his obvious - indeed designated - successor, Jean-Claude Trichet, will not step into his shoes before the euro notes and coins are introduced in 2002. </p> <p>At a press conference last Thursday the ECB closed ranks and Duisenberg teasingly conceded, when asked to resign, that he had accepted advice 'and I am not going to answer any questions related to that recent interview'. He then went on, mercifully, to restate the official line that 'intervention is a tool available to central banks to be used if and when appropriate'. </p> <p>The original gaffe was all the more remarkable in the light of the time it had taken for the G7 to get its act together. Way back in January the G7 discussed intervention, but only Japan was keen. At the April G7 meeting the French and the Italians wanted a statement about intervention but the Germans didn't. Japan is believed to have intervened heavily this year to prevent the yen from appreciating further against the dollar, and with some success. It was only in September that the Europeans could agree on the need for intervention. Then, having impressed the markets and got them on tenterhooks (which always helps against speculative fever), the ECB president nearly ruined it. </p> <p>These are sensitive times, and the markets are prepared to make mountains of molehills. There was a widespread assumption that the US Federal Reserve would not intervene in the markets before the 7 November presidential election, but it did. The Fed was keener on intervention than the US Treasury, and can advise it on the need for intervention, but takes its final instructions from the Treasury. A little-noticed item in the Times interview was Duisenberg's remark that the market was 'decidedly wrong' if its impression was that the US intervention had been 'very modest'. </p> <p>The market is also obsessed by statements by US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers that he favours a strong dollar. Certainly, Summers favours a strong dollar. But I doubt whether he favours the collapse of US multinational business in Europe, or would stand idly by if the euro looked like going into a freefall precipitated either by a Middle East war or by some other financial panic. </p> <p>As the FT 's excellent market reports observed: 'Mr Summers trod a fine line [after Duisenberg's gaffe] reiterating his support for the long-standing strong dollar policy while saying he shared concerns over the euro.' And one of the Fed governors, Robert Parry, said the strong dollar was 'denting corporate profitability and exports'. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that the world economy is finely poised, and nothing can be ruled out on the G7 front. For the moment, the central bankers - from Alan Greenspan to the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - give the impression that there is no panic on the inflation front from higher oil prices, provided they don't go much higher, and provided wage bargainers do not respond with inflationary wage claims. </p> <p>But this relative optimism could change, and my own impression is that last week's reassuring speech by Greenspan was - given the US trade deficit, the vulnerability of Wall Street and the unknowns in the oil market - at the upper end of complacency for a central bank governor. </p> <p>My final thought for those who think currency intervention is out of the question is a reminder of what Margaret Thatcher did in January 1985 when the pound threatened to fall to $1. She simply changed her non-intervention policy and rang up her friend Ronald Reagan to ask for his help as well. </p> <p>Of course, the nice thing about intervention is that, in the end, finance ministries and central banks can do it with other people's money. But, properly handled, intervention can also be in the interest of the entire world economy.</p>",
  "It is one of the most surreal yet symbolic scenes of the post-war Balkans. Every night a faint glow can be seen through the windows of the great, unfinished Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in the centre of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. <p>But the gentle light comes not from candles, ghosts or angels. Inside the church is a large tent. And inside the tent are three Royal Marines commandos. If you come at the right time, they will all be sitting on their sofa clutching mugs of tea and watching EastEnders. A fourth will be outside keeping guard, making sure the church is not razed by Kosovo's Albanians who see it as a symbol of a past and a people they hate. </p> <p>Three weeks after Slobodan Milosevic fell from power, and a week before Kosovo's Albanians cast their votes in their first internationally supervised free election, everything and nothing has changed here. While there is little doubt British troops will be watching EastEnders and protecting Kosovo's Serbian churches and churchgoers for years to come, it is also clear the events in Belgrade have altered the political landscape. </p> <p>Sixteen months ago, at the end of the Kosovo war, as 850,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees streamed home in the wake of Nato's victory, Kosovo's independence seemed imminent. But, now, with the rehabilitation of Serbia's image at the fall of Milosevic, the international community's sympathy for Kosovo's Albanians is over. </p> <p>Their leaders were dismayed at Milosevic's fall. Hashim Thaci, ex-leader of the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, says: 'I fought for democracy in Kosovo - not for democracy in Serbia!' </p> <p>Across the street from the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is the office of Pleurat Sejdiu. During the dark days of Serbian repression he sought asylum in Britain where he drove a minicab. When the war began in 1998, he emerged as the KLA's spokesman in London. Now he shares the job of Kosovo's Minister of Health in the United Nation's administration. 'What happened in Belgrade is good for Serbs but neither good nor bad for others,' he says. </p> <p>Others say Vojislav Kostunica, Yugoslavia's new President, is a Serbian nationalist just like Milosevic. A picture of him holding a Kalashnikov in Kosovo is proof, say Albanian newspapers, that he was a paramilitary leader. There is no evidence of this and Kostunica says the gun was thrust into his hands during a visit. </p> <p>But there is little doubt that when Kostunica has consolidated his power, probably after Serbia's elections on 23 December, he will turn his attention to Kosovo. </p> <p>UN Security Council Resolution 1244 may have sealed Serbia's defeat, but it did specify that, pending a resolution of its final status, Kosovo remained part of Yugoslavia. It also said that at a certain, unspecified time 'hundreds' of Yugoslav and Serbian 'personnel' would be allowed to return to Kosovo. </p> <p>So, Kosovo's leaders have been looking on with increasing horror as they see Kostunica courted by Western leaders as diplomats dust down old plans for a federation or confederation of Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. 'There will be no links with Serbia in any confederation,' says Sejdiu, 'end of story.' </p> <p>But it will not be the end. Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs the UN's Kosovo administration, is clearly not relishing the day when Kostunica wants to visit again. 'OK, welcome!' he says. 'But, we would have to organise that in terms of security, so it is a bit premature. But the idea is not stupid. It is really a question of time.' </p> <p>As the Kosovo Albanians go to the polls, this is not what they want to hear. But their leaders have no policies, except independence, about which they all agree. While Serbia's politicians look to the future, Kosovo's poll is about who did what during the war and the last 10 years. </p> <p>Kosovo's Albanian leadership will have to think of a more sophisticated strategy to deal with Serbia than it has had until now. </p> <p> Tim Judah is the author of 'Kosovo: War and Revenge' published by Yale University Press</p>",
  "The weeks of violence and brutality in the Middle East which erupted so suddenly on the eve of Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of judgment, have shattered the complacency and illusions which had grown up around the peace process. <p>As an active member of the Anglo-Jewish community who has closely observed the Middle East from on the ground in Jerusalem and the West Bank, in Washington, in front of my television screen and the British newspapers, the last few weeks have been an emotional roller coaster. The caricature of Israel as a pariah state with a wanton disregard for human life has deeply affected me and all those in the Jewish community. </p> <p>I believe that fairness and balance in the coverage of Israel have given way to sensationalism and distortion, which has made it all but impossible to follow events with any sense of detachment or comfort. The impact has been heightened for me by the hideous sight of the Israeli flag being burnt outside the House of Commons and the insults being hurled at my offspring on university campuses. All of this during the profound period of introspection and festivity which comes at this time of the Jewish year. It has left me with a deep personal sense of betrayal. </p> <p>Supporters of Israel have been profoundly hurt by the re-emergence of a public debate which has challenged not only the legitimacy of the American-brokered peace process but the very morality and existence of Israel. The old clich\u00e9s of apartheid, occupation, overwhelming violence and the suppression of the human rights of the Palestinian have been dusted off and the legitimacy of the Jewish state challenged. Israel's rights of access to the most holy sites of Judaism have been questioned. </p> <p>There are no shortages of intelligent complaint about Israeli implementation of the Oslo peace process. Settlement policy remains an affront to Palestinian self-determination. The failure of Israel and the peacemakers to make good financial and trade promises to the Palestinians has opened a socio-economic chasm between hi-tech Israel and poverty-stricken West Bank and Gaza. These arguments have been barely heard above the unreason, prejudice and knee-jerk leftist politics. </p> <p>The United Nations, which over the decades has used Israel as an international punch bag as it asserted its hatred of imperialism, reverted to type by apportioning blame before inquiry. It ignores the present Israeli government's implementation of the UN's long-forgotten resolutions when it withdrew from the Lebanon to celebratory sounds of Hamas gunfire. The UN attitude is to condemn and ask questions afterwards. </p> <p>Despite the efforts of President Bill Clinton at Sharm el-Sheikh in fashioning a fragile way forward for the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, no one seriously believes that the fissures, hatreds and stereotypes which have emerged over the last three weeks can easily be shaken off. </p> <p>Much of the public debate in this conflict has been generated by a handful of searing media portraits. We can all conjure them up and place our own complexions upon them. That first image, in this paper, of the father in Gaza seeking to shelter his son from a deadly bullet. Palestinian youth trampling over the sacred site of the patriarch Joseph's tomb in Nablus, tearing it apart brick by brick and setting alight the holy books and Torah scrolls in a scene straight from Kristallnacht. There was the blood-stained frenzy of the lynch mob in Ramallah. The body bags filled with American sailors being returned to American bases in Germany from Yemen. The precision attacks by Israeli helicopter gunships on the police station in Ramallah. And the sight of a single Israeli soldier with a loaded rifle, being driven back by a howling mob, armed only with stones, to his fortified position. </p> <p>Each of these can and were interpreted in singular ways. The death of a young boy in Gaza has become the symbol of overwhelming force, a cruel Israeli military armed to the teeth using unnecessary force against juveniles resulting in a death toll across the region in which the Palestinians have overwhelmingly suffered. There can be no doubt that the Israel Defence Force lacks training in modern crowd control and at times has appeared to operate a policy of shoot first and ask questions after. </p> <p>But much of the conflict which has taken place has been in desert outposts or narrow, ancient streets, not the wide open spaces of Trafalgar Square where water cannon might turn back the vengeful crowd. They also are acutely aware that turned loose among the Palestinian civilians are the Hamas fighters freed from Palestinian internment and the 40,000 weapons supplied by the Israelis and Americans to support the Palestinian police. </p> <p>However, what kind of civilised people is that sends out its young people with stones, bottles and whatever weapons can be mustered against a modern army while the police enforcers stand by and watch? That is the behaviour of those who would sacrifice their children for sake of hollow propaganda. Reservists and soldiers who ignore the collective hatred of the rioters, worked up into a frenzy in the mosques and schools, do so at their personal peril. Any suggestion that this is the non-violent protest of Martin Luther King or the uplifting revolution on the streets of Belgrade does not bear scrutiny. </p> <p>The scene at the tomb of Joseph was quickly expunged from our screens, to be replaced with a video of a Jewish mob attacking a mosque in Nazareth, as if this were a football match with the action moving from one end of the field to the other. But to the Jews of Israel and the Diaspora the scenes in Nablus, where a rabbi was stabbed, had an entirely different meaning. One of the core aspirations of all those involved in the peace process has been to ensure safe and open access to all holy sites, whether they be Jewish, Islamic or Christian. </p> <p>Debates as to whether the Temple Mount as the 2,000-year-old font of Judaism, or the al-Aksa Mosque as the third most holy site in Islam, is more or less important to their respective religions are irrelevant. What is critical is that these places of pilgrimage are accessible and preserved. </p> <p>The desecration of Joseph's tomb sent a chilling message of religious intolerance, which all those Jews expelled from Arab land in recent decades understand only too well. Entrusting any Jewish sites including the Kotel, the Wailing Wall, to the safe hands of the Palestinians or international peacekeepers who could be withdrawn anytime, is not now a risk which any peacemaker, however bold, would dare take. </p> <p>As for the blood-stained lynching in Ramallah, when the rampaging gangs put behind them the Islamic belief in the sanctity of the dead, it too is beyond comprehension. Palestinian spokesmen could barely mouth the word condemnation. Instead, they focused on the destruction of the funeral pyre of the police station in Ramallah by gunships. Yet this was a bloodless retaliation, carried out after warnings to civilians to leave the streets and without the loss of any life. The message was, desist from random violence. </p> <p>If for the moment the culture of blame, which has distorted the analysis of the events of the last weeks, is put to one side then far more fundamental questions have to be asked. Israeli spokesmen such as veteran peacemaker Shimon Peres, who staked his career on co-existence with the Palestinians, are right to point out that the Jewish state has fulfilled its promise of land for peace. It has given up occupation in large parts of the territories, in Southern Lebanon and in the Golan. But he and other Israeli leaders also need to recognise that the settlements, with their own network of roads and communications through the Judean Hills, remain an affront to Palestinian sovereignty; that Oslo was also about building trade and economic ties throughout the Middle East, so that a superstructure of prosperity brought the communities together. </p> <p>This has never really happened. An August 2000 briefing paper by the World Bank chronicles how output in the West Bank and Gaza declined by 2 to 3 per cent a year between 1994 and 1999. Gross domestic product per capita stands at around $1,500, against a figure closer to $17,000 in Israel, the beneficiary of a hi-tech revolution. Progress in the Palestinian areas has been impeded by border and customs restrictions, which have made it enormously difficult for Palestinians to move their goods to market. The peace process has produced land and poverty: an economic cauldron of indifference has boiled up. Israel is right to be indignant about the way the world has turned against it. But it must also recognise some share of responsibility. </p> <p>\u0095 Alex Brummer is City Editor of the 'Daily Mail'.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

  "<p>John Burton-Race, 43, is well known in epicurean circles as one of Britain's top Michelin-starred chefs. Egon Ronay, founder of the re-staurant guide, describes him as 'one of a handful of truly great chefs in this country' and Lenny Henry's character in Chef was based upon him. But are his fi-nances as beautifully plan-ned as his menus? </p> <p> 'I'm spend, spend, spend,' he admits. 'I spend 75 per cent on one credit card alone and that's American Ex-press. Paying it all off at the end of the month is essential for me because otherwise I would just keep on going.' John's wife, Kim, holds the purse strings in the Burton-Race household which, with six children, is a big responsibility. Burton-Race earns more than \u00a3100,000 but still feels he needs to boost his income with various consultancy jobs. </p> <p> Earlier this year, he moved his famous restaurant at L'Ortolan in Shinfield, near Reading, to the Landmark, a London hotel. Financially, he says, the move was a nightmare. 'Everything was done in such a hurry with nothing but a wing and a prayer.' With 23 days to go be-fore he took control of the kitchen at the Landmark, the sale of L'Ortolan had failed to go through after several abortive efforts. 'I had to get a bridging loan and put my house in Chiswick on the market. I have to say my branch manager at Barclays was absolutely brilliant. In the end we decided to sell the Chiswick house and move the family out to L'Ortolan. It's a big place but with six kids, we need the space and it's just perfect. </p> <p> 'Everything seems to have worked out for the best. But it hasn't always been this way. My first salary as an apprentice chef was \u00a39 a week and I had to spend \u00a34.50 a week on travelling to and from work. It's five or six years before a chef starts seeing any real financial reward, rather like a young doctor or a vet. Rents, particularly in London, are absolutely crippling. I pay my young lads around \u00a317,000 but from that they need to buy their uniform, their knives and pay their rent.' </p> <p> Now he pays about \u00a3950,000 a year in wages to his team of 41 based at John Burton-Race at the Landmark. It's probably one reason for the restaurant's prices being about as 'haute' as cuisine can go. There is a set-price lunch for \u00a328, set dinner for \u00a345 and a menu gourmand for \u00a3160 for two without wine. The restaurant will eventually become his flagship as he also has plans for two or three sim pler brasserie-style venues around London. </p> <p> This winner of various stars and awards also has a penchant for fast cars. He sheepishly admits that commuting between home and work is something he enjoys. 'It's not so bad in a Porsche,' he says. </p> <p> His major expenditure apart from the Porsche? 'My kids would represent 60 per cent on a graph of outgoings. I like taking the children on one nice holiday abroad a year. My wife probably spends 35 per cent, which leaves 5 per cent for me.' And the Porsche presumably.'We love eating out. Going to the Gavroche is something which Kim and I enjoy often.' </p> <p> And does he miss the re-staurant at L'Ortolan? 'It's harder here because it's just beginning,' he says. 'August was a bit iffy but then August is always a bit iffy in London. It's generally much more exciting, more of a gamble.'</p>",
  "The designer Giorgio Armani is at the centre of a row convulsing New York about whether art, which increasingly seems to resemble showbiz, has made a Faustian pact with fashion and the dollar. <p>When Armani swept into the Guggenheim Museum for a star-studded soir\u00e9e to celebrate a major retrospective of his career last week, the scent of insurrection was in the air. Amid the accolades and air-kisses, Armani - who described the event as 'the crowning moment of my life in fashion' - might have felt surprised that anyone could question the inclusion of his clothes in the same building as modern master painters. </p> <p>'Fashion is at the heart of human expression and is a mirror that reflects society and its culture', Armani, designer of the Eighties power suit, said, flanked by Hollywood stars like Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Lauren Bacall and Richard Gere. 'It's a great honour to know that my designs stand alongside the work of some of the most influential artists of the twentieth century.' </p> <p>But some art critics charge that the custodians of art have been blinded by the glitz of fashion. 'These are very cynical decisions,' says New York art critic Hilton Kramer. 'Frankly, I don't know of any serious art critic, art historian or artist - or serious art collector, even those collectors that wear those clothes - who regard Armani's suits as works of art.' </p> <p>Fashion exhibitions have almost turned Manhattan's museums into catwalk shows. French designer Azzedine Alaia has a major exhibition of his flirty designs, there are any number of fashion photography exhibits in art galleries and an exhibition for the Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido at a gallery owned by New York University. </p> <p>Next year the Metropolitan Museum of Art will mount 'Jacqueline Kennedy, the White House Years' featuring the first lady's wardrobe (except, of course, her most famous outfit: the pink Chanel outfit she wore on 22 November, 1963). The art world's discomfort lies in the fear that it will be exposed for having prostituted itself. 'Fashion wants the legitimacy and authority of art. It's looking for absolution from transience,' says New York curator Neville Wakefield. In exchange, he says, 'the art world wants fabulousness, and better parties'. </p> <p>But it is the scent of cold cash that has most upset art critics. A month after the Armani exhibition was announced, the Guggenheim revealed the designer was making a three-year, $15 million donation to the museum. 'It's creating the impression that the museum is for sale, and that if you have enough money and if you're an important enough company, you can buy the museum to promote your product,' says Kramer. </p> <p>Neither is the fashion world wholly in favour of a marriage with art. Last May, the Metropolitan cancelled a Coco Chanel retrospective after a spat between Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld and the museum over creative control of the exhibition. </p> <p>In a review of Armani's show, Herbert Muschamp, art critic for the New York Times , wrote that he had no objection to fashion-as-art: 'Historical amnesia, intellectual pretension, cronyism, promotion, delusion, sycophancy, bribery, betrayal ... these are some of the lubricants that make the wheels of fashion turn.' </p> <p>But, he added, 'If you enjoy the fashion spectacle, you wouldn't want to miss one treacherous moment.' He might have added that these values also hold true in the art world.</p>",
  "It was not the showdown scriptwriters had in mind. Leonardo DiCaprio was supposed to fight knife-wielding thugs, not a raging Martin Scorsese. <p>But when two of Hollywood's powerful men clashed on the set of their latest film, the cast knew what to blame: Rome. </p> <p>For Scorsese, The Gangs of New York is one of the biggest blockbusters that he has ever directed, an $80 million gamble to show he can make a box-office hit. </p> <p>For DiCaprio, it is a chance to regain the worldwide acclaim - and lust - that has ebbed since Titanic . It is also a chance for Rome's fabled Cinecitt\u00e0 studios to recapture the magic of its golden age, when stars flocked to its giant sets to make epics such as Ben-Hur and Cleopatra . </p> <p>Producers overlooked the lure of la dolce vita. Not the film, the reality, for Rome is indeed the sweet life and DiCaprio has been partying hard, too hard. With his Brazilian model girlfriend, Gisele Bundchen, he has been hitting one nightclub after the other with the paparazzi in pursuit. </p> <p>Shambling bleary-eyed from his Hilton hotel suite into a limousine, he has been chronically late for morning shoots. The schedule slipped and Scorsese flipped. </p> <p>DiCaprio arrived on set last week to a public roasting in front of cast and extras. The director of Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas let loose a 10-minute tirade that left his leading man speechless. An Italian extra, who plays a rival gang member, said: 'I couldn't understand it all because he was speaking so fast, but he was very angry. We didn't know where to look.' </p> <p>Since then DiCaprio has been punctual and large set-pieces are scheduled to begin shooting tomorrow. Set in the Bronx slums in the 1850s, the film tells the story of rival Irish, Italian and Chinese immigrants fighting for control during Tammany Hall's political corruption. As violence escalates, DiCaprio, playing a gang leader, Amsterdam, becomes entangled with a thief, played by Cameron Diaz. </p> <p>DiCaprio's lifestyle echoes the stars of the Fifties and Sixties, who made Hollywood on the Tiber a byword for glamour and hedonism. While Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita immortalised Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg frolicking in the Trevi Fountain, celebrities partied on Via Veneto. </p> <p>Bosses at Cinecitt\u00e0 hope Gangs will inject cash and confidence into an ailing Italian film industry. Conceived by dictator Benito Mussolini as a vehicle for Fascist propaganda, the 600-acre studios nurtured directors and producers such as Fellini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentiis. Cinecitt\u00e0 was reborn post-war as the cradle of Europe's best talent and hosted classics such as War And Peace, Spartacus, Quo Vadis? and A Farewell To Arms, as well as spaghetti Westerns. </p> <p>The privatisation of Cine-citt\u00e0 and the amending of tax laws have coincided with Hollywood's quest for cheap foreign locations. 'Italian film-making is beginning to pick up. This has come at just the right time,' said Tony Villani, film professor at the American University of Rome.</p>",

  "I watched the life drain from a young man who had been shot in the face by the Israeli Defence Force: his skin colour fading to ash while frantic paramedics fought without hope under a darkening sky. <p>A swirl of onlookers surged towards the open-air first aid station, a few hundred yards back from the battle of Nablus: the stink of burning tyres, the sky racked with gunshots cracking out, a whoop-whoop of sirens, groans of the wounded and the dying, screams of angry men, fizzing with fear, grief, helplessness, rage. </p> <p>It was the 48th hour of the 48-hour deadline for peace to break out as set down at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit and a terrible paroxysm of anger was surging through the crowd. A youngster, no more than 12 years old, hammered a red-bereted Palestinian soldier carrying a Kalashnikov. He wanted the gun so he could avenge the dead - and the soldier backed away, terrified of the lad, of the vortex of emotion circling around him. </p> <p>Then the crowd surged towards the first aid station, some men in their rage fighting the paramedics maintaining a ring around the man with the hole in his face. </p> <p>I was standing on the balcony, watching the scene from 20 feet away, and the lady of the house screaming in terror grabbed me and pulled me away from view, lest the mob focus its rage on the outsider. More gunshots, more terror and then I watched the dying man all but thrown into the back of an ambulance. </p> <p>It was four o'clock on Friday afternoon and the man with the hole in his face was one of dozens of wounded and five dead Palestinians who paid the price of Israel's decision to take a 'time-out' from the peace process. </p> <p>It is dead. Whatever the fine words of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and President Bill Clinton, the news from the ground, from behind the Palestinian barricades in the West Bank, is that the peace process is dead. As the United Nations voted to condemn the 'excessive use' of Israeli force in the past three weeks the question is: who murdered the last best chance for peace? </p> <p>Look at the numbers. Since the visit to the mosque in Jerusalem on 28 September by the right-wing Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon, 119 people have been killed. Seven Israelis dead, and 112 Palestinians. Look at the ages. All the dead Israelis have been men old enough for military service. Quite a few of the stone throwers picked out in the gun-sights of the Israeli Defence Force have been boys, not men. On Friday on the West Bank they slotted a 13-year old boy with two bullets to the heart. </p> <p>The Israeli Defence Force is one of the best armies in the world. The optics of their weapons are the very best American technology. When the 13-year-old was shot dead, the soldier knew exactly who he was shooting. The target's young face would have loomed large in the gun-sight. It is stupid and wrong for mothers and fathers to allow children out onto the streets to fight an army, but that is not an adequate excuse for killing a child. </p> <p>Look at the economics. Since Oslo, there has been no serious peace dividend for the Palestinians of the West Bank, only more unemployment, less work, less business, more refined restrictions, more imaginative curbs on their freedom of movement, their ability to trade as equals. The Palestinians have given up on the peace process because it wasn't giving them what they wanted - their own country - and they have nothing to lose. The Israelis have much to lose, but they never gave enough to make peace work. </p> <p>And for all the intricate power play between Ehud Barak, the Israeli Prime Minister, President Clinton the peace-maker and Chairman Yasser Arafat, they could not overcome the forces ranged against them. </p> <p>All Sharon had to do was visit the wrong place at the wrong time and the delicate balance of peace was crushed to matchwood. </p> <p>In this climate of hopelessness, all that was needed was an excuse for more killing to take place. The madness in Nablus on Friday came at the end of two funerals for men who had been shot dead in a gun battle occasioned by a 'hike' by Jewish settlers, right-wing religious fundamentalists who choose to live in the West Bank. They had decided to go towards Nablus - a hotbed of Palestinian anger since the time of the British Mandate in the 1930s. </p> <p>The hike was to view Joseph's Tomb, in which stood a sarcophagus thought to house his bones. The site is one of three that Jews claim because they were bought for the 'Jewish people' by characters from the Bible, in this case Jacob, who bought a nearby well from Hamor for 100 pieces of silver (Genesis 33:19). That claim, in the eyes of the settlers, overrides the reality that the Tomb is in a Palestinian-controlled town. </p> <p>The result is that Joseph's Tomb has been a running sore down the ages. In the 1996 disturbances, Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinian rioters near the tomb. After Sharon's visit to the mosque three weeks ago, Palestinian fundamentalists - and there are many in Nablus - wrecked the tomb, and tortured and killed a rabbi who had come to check on it. </p> <p>The tomb today is an empty hulk, freshly white-washed, with only a couple of charred wooden frames evidencing the atrocity. </p> <p>The settlers came armed with M16 automatic assault rifles. They were 40 strong, bringing their women and children too. </p> <p>They were given permission to go towards what is, for a Jew, probably the most dangerous place on earth, Nablus, while the leaders of the world were hoping and praying that the Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt would work its magic on a troubled land. It was a provocation, carried out in righteous conviction by fanatics. </p> <p>So why did the Israeli Defence Force give permission for it to go ahead? 'This was not an attempt to defuse the situation and bring calm,' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. 'When they permitted the hike, they allowed the match to light the explosive.' </p> <p>The gun battle raged for one long hot afternoon last Thursday, the settlers high up on a bluff overlooking Joseph's Tomb, the Palestinians taking cover below them. One Palestinian soldier, Mohammed, 22, told The Observer: 'What happened was that as the settlers were coming down the mountain, what they call Mount Ebal, a white car drove towards them. In it were four Palestinians, men and women, on the way to pick olives. The settlers opened fire first, on this car.' </p> <p>There was no way of checking his story, but what is true is that, pinned down, the settlers used their mobile phones to call for help. 'It is really scary. There is one per son injured and we are waiting for help,' one woman said, four hours into the fighting. </p> <p>There is no good road up there, and the Israelis were forced to call in the helicopter gunships. They opened up on the Palestinian fighters below, on the houses they were taking cover in. </p> <p>And living in those houses, of course, were hundreds of Palestinian civilians. The old woman showed me the gutted ruins of her parlour and the hole in the window where the 50mm armour-piercing bullet had entered and shredded her sofa. The children, aged two, three, four and five, were cowering next door. They had been hurried off to hospital, but had only suffered from smoke damage. 'Thank God,' she said. </p> <p>Two men died in the shoot-out, Rabbi Binyamin Herling, 64, and Palestinian Zahi al-Arda, 34. </p> <p>On Friday morning, before the madness began, both sides buried their dead. The Palestinians processing the cold form of Zahi around Nablus, his face open to the sky. </p> <p>They chanted, and fired gunshots in the air and waved freshly-minted pictures of the martyr in the air. No pictures of Yasser Arafat were on display - the single exception being his 10ft tall smiling face staring out from the Palestinian Ministry of Interior building. Arafat's police watched the mourners pass in an uneasy silence. Many in Nablus believe that the Chairman gave away too much at Sharm el-Sheikh. </p> <p>I drove across the front line - burnt-out tyres, tank tracks on roads chillingly empty of life - and up into a Jewish settlement directly overlooking Nablus called Itmar, looking like nothing more than a spanking new Wimpey-style estate in a war zone. </p> <p>The streets were empty apart from a few kids, one of them a little girl playing on her micro-scooter. On Thursday night some settlers had put up a road-block, using an Austin Montego to create havoc. The road-block's leader roared: 'Welcome to the Wild West Bank.' </p> <p>A woman, originally from New York, made me a cup of tea. She was a sweet woman, still trembling from having seen the gunships fire at the hillside across the valley from her neighbour's porch the previous day. </p> <p>Had I driven alone? I explained that I had left my Palestinian driver in Nablus, having promised him that I wasn't going to steal his taxi. She flashed back: 'It's probably one of ours anyway.' </p> <p>And that was almost as bad as the man with the hole in his face: a transparently good woman, mouthing hate for a taxi driver she'd never met simply because he was of another race. </p> <p>Yesterday morning there were five more funerals in Nablus. So it goes. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "When the viola player charged off the stage, his colleagues assumed he'd broken a string. The violist knew differently. This was the end of his career. <p>It had started earlier during the performance - a nagging voice in his head telling him he was 'a fraud' and 'not good enough' to be there. 'My bow hand started to tremble. I doubt the person next to me even noticed, but it felt like an earthquake. My hand started to freeze so the vibrato sounded like a nanny goat.' It was a three-hour performance and it would be a torment to survive. 'My heart was going 19 to the dozen. I felt sheer terror - claustrophobia. I was playing in a sea of strings and had to swim with everyone else. It was like being in a straitjacket. </p> <p>I felt cold and tingly, even my vision was affected, I could barely see the music. Stage fright is exhausting. I thought I would collapse.' </p> <p>The performance was a success and, to prolong the violist's agony, the audience cried for more. The encore would be just four minutes long and the music was technically unchallenging, but it was still too much. 'As I rushed out, a brass player was coming on to the stage. I handed him my instrument then slid down the wall on to the floor. The man asked me my name but I couldn't remember it. I was so relieved to be off stage, but also very ashamed.' Today, relaxed and happy, the man still refuses to reveal his name. The professional stigma of stage fright in the performing world is too shaming - the taboo too insurmountable.</p> <p>In the trade, a bad case of the shakes is known as 'the pearlies' as in 'Pearly Gates', says Julian Maunder, who teaches strings and offers shiatsu to stressed musicians. He says these people would rather suffer in silence than risk their careers. 'It's like people calling cancer \"the Big C\". They think if they say it they will catch it. Stage fright is the same.' </p> <p>Strangely, performers are not just hush-hush about stage fright and stress but also illnesses and injuries generally. 'Within all of the performing arts, the pervading attitude is that the show must go on. Performers are expected to overcome injuries and illness. If you fail to overcome this, there will always be 30 to 50 people wanting to step into your shoes. There is no incentive to put your hand up and say, \"I need time out,\"' explains Eileen Quilter Williams, general administrator of the British Performing Arts Medicine Trust (BPAMT). </p> <p>The Trust, a registered charity whose patrons include Richard Baker, Simon Rattle and Cliff Richard, among others, is now in its 16th year. It offers a designated health service to performers, including musicians (popular and classical), actors and dancers. It views these professionals as special cases not dissimilar to sports stars. Here is a group for whom even minor medical problems can impact on their very livelihoods. A sore throat, for example - a mere inconvenience for most of us - could be momentous for an opera singer. </p> <p>In addition, punishing schedules bring a whole raft of occupational hazards into play. Musicians are at risk of muscular problems and hearing difficulties. Actors and dancers risk injury. Irregular hours and long rehearsals allow little time for healthy living and the competitive nature of showbiz raises stress levels into the stratosphere. It is either ironic or a classic example of self-protective denial that the performing world thrives on a culture of repression. It's a case of put up or shut up. </p> <p>Angelina Spurrier, a classical ballerina who works at the BPAMT, remembers one director telling any dancer who complained: 'I have a top hat full of names of girls who will dance for me for nothing.' During her career touring in Germany, she says she never dared show any weaknesses. 'You had to appear to be 100 per cent focused at all times. Any anxiety and even injuries had to be buried. So many of the girls I worked with had eating disorders or drinking problems and everybody smoked.' </p> <p>But the culture is changing. Increasing numbers of performers are learning of the BPAMT's existence and turning to it for help, while health and safety legislation means employers can no longer afford to be complacent. </p> <p>Typically, a performer's first contact with the BPAMT is made via the charity's helpline. Around 20 to 30 people call each day and most are invited to attend one of its clinics or are put in touch with an appropriate consultant, doctor or therapist. At the BPAMT's headquarters in London's Covent Garden, Louise Miller, a GP working part time in a city practice, is holding her monthly clinic. Like so many of the Trust's doctors, she has a strong interest in the performing arts, singing in a choir and playing the cello. She gives her time for free, offering each patient a 30-minute consultation - a luxury compared to the seven to 10 minutes most of us get when we visit our doctor.</p> <p>'I love coming here. I never know who is going to walk through the door next. I have seen everything: actors with acne, singers who think their voices change when they go on the pill, tumblers with back problems, dancers with eating disorders, keyboard players with neck problems,' explains Dr Miller. The list goes on. Musicians arrive with their instruments. Dr Miller likes to watch how they play, as their posture or the way they move or hold their instrument can provide diagnostic clues. If an instrument is too big to carry, she will have them simulate the movement by using her desk as, say, a mock keyboard or drum kit.</p> <p>Simon Hallett, a double-bass player with the Royal Opera House Orchestra, consults Dr Miller with an archetypal musician's complaint. He has hearing problems. 'The pit is so enclosed that it is like a resonating box. Over the last 12 to 18 months, I have experienced a loss of high frequency sounds and I also have mild tinnitus,' he explains. He has already seen a doctor but wants a second opinion from the BPAMT's empathetic and knowledgeable medical team.</p> <p>'An ordinary GP may not recognise that the problem takes on a new importance because you are a musician. They will treat you the same as if you are a bricklayer,' says Hallett. He is delighted that the Trust also helps raise awareness. When he first joined his orchestra, musicians were not offered hearing tests and nobody wore earplugs. Now this is standard practice. Dr Miller is familiar with the issue - the use of earplugs is one of her hobbyhorses. As well as running clinics at the Trust, she is the medical advisor to the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) and insists that all its musicians wear earplugs.</p> <p>Placing doctors with orchestras is another service overseen by the Trust. Dr Miller was assigned to the LPO in April last year and remembers being invited to stand on the conductor's rostrum to introduce herself to the 'band'. As a perk, she gets to see her patients perform for free. 'As they come on stage, I wonder how they are feeling. It is very nice going to a concert where you know the performers.' Dr Miller visits the orchestra every three to four weeks, whenever it is resident in London. Her sessions take the form of an open house. Any LPO performer with a medical issue can consult her.</p> <p>Typical problems include string players with muscular-skeletal problems, musicians with hearing problems or complaints about stress, exhaustion or performance anxiety. For the latter, she may suggest relaxation techniques or, if a performance is imminent, prescribe beta-blockers. However, if the problem is more severe, she might refer the patient on to one of the BPAMT's specialists, such as psychotherapist Tony Yates. The frightened viola player (not a member of the LPO) who dashed from the stage found help via the Trust. Tony describes the man's 'critical inner voice' as 'a severe superego'. It is a phenomenon he sees commonly. He says the problem normally stems from childhood, where the critical voice was that of a pushy parent.</p> <p>'This inner voice may be partly aspirational (it tells you how to perform better) but is also partly judgmental,' says Yates. As part of his therapy, he teaches the patient to 'separate their self-esteem from the performance'. In other words, the person is taught to have an identity outside their work.</p> <p>'Interestingly, the minute you take the focus off the performance and look at the person's whole life, the performance problem starts to diminish,' he says. </p> <p>He likens the process to marital therapy, which may bring a couple closer or help them to separate. And so it is with performers. Therapy helped make the viola player 'psychologically healthier', but he has stopped performing professionally. 'Now I just play for the hell of it. I play better now than before because I no longer carry that burden.'</p> <p><b>What is the BPAMT?</b></p> <p>The British Performing Arts Medicine Trust (BPAMT) is a charity that puts performing artists in touch with a network of doctors, associated professionals and alternative practitioners experienced in performing artists' problems.</p> <p>Regular clinics are held at the BPAMT's headquarters in London and Manchester. Practitioners running these sessions include, among others, GPs, an ear, nose and throat consultant and two hand specialists. Therapists working with the Trust range from psychologists to chiropractors. Most services are offered to performers free of charge, or at reduced rates. If you are a professional performing artist or 'serious' amateur (such as a member of a colliery band or choir) in need of medical support call the BPAMT's helpline on: 020 7240 4500 (London) or 0845 602 0235 (outside London).</p> <p>The BPAMT also runs the Association of Medical Advisors to British Orchestras, which is currently seeking to recruit medical professionals who can donate their time free of charge.

  "Any man will to some extent agree that a rudimentary understanding of the condition commonly known as PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome) is essential. For a man, to be forewarned and forearmed means to be better able to understand and possibly be of worthwhile help. For a woman, to be able to justify why all hell breaks loose once a month might make her feel more in control of the situation - for feeling out of control is the crux of the problem. <p>The process of menstruation is complex, involving three major, and inextricably linked, organs. First, according to those Oriental doctors of old, your spleen (under your ribs on the left) is integrally connected to your pituitary gland, master-switch of the endocrine system. This controls your appetite (especially for sweet things), your short-term memory, your feelings of satisfaction with life on a moment-by-moment basis and, most importantly, the overall production of blood. In the few days leading up to menstruation, the spleen has to work twice as hard to build blood to replace that which will be lost during the period. That's why you crave more sweet food, can't remember where you left your keys and whatever someone says or does is not good enough.</p> <p>Second, your liver, whose job it is to store, purify and release the blood on demand, is also in charge of your 'animal soul' - the wild one within, with all its potential for unbridled emotional chaos, including and especially the expression of rage. Just before the period, as the liver cranks up to work overtime on the new blood load, it strains, overheats and, in so doing, loses control of the wild woman. Hence the sudden bursts of unprovoked anger and feelings of frustration: whether in your relationships or your work. When added to a maladjusted spleen, this can produce an inflammatory mix.</p> <p>Third, the kidneys, responsible for overall maintenance of the womb and reproductive system, are also in charge of eliminating waste (through urination), regulating body fluids, maintaining body temperature, stabilising the emotional landscape in general and the flow of tears in particular, and keeping you feeling safe in the world. The kidneys are, with the help of the spleen and liver, in charge of providing, circulating and regenerating the yin or female energy for the entire system, itself intricately interlinked with all internal functions and especially the 100 per cent, no-men-need-apply menstrual process.</p> <p>Just before the period, the kidneys tend to suffer an appreciable loss of energy through the extra exertion, potentially leaving you weepy, bloated, temperamental, anxious, occasionally spotty, clammy, hot and cold, fraught and feeling like you can't cope. So when you throw depleted kidney energy into the equation, you have the full three-dimensional horror of full-blown PMS, complete with anguish, hurled plates and household nuclear war.</p> <p>To suggest a universal remedy is as impossible as suggesting which colour T-shirt would suit everyone in the UK. It all depends on the constitutional state of the liver, spleen, kidneys, reproductive system, hormone levels and temperament of the individual. </p> <p>However, it is fair to say that agnus castus can work wonders in reducing water retention and often all other symptoms, too. Mega B complex with extra B6 can be helpful in supporting the liver.</p> <p>Donquai is effective for keeping the kidneys strong and supporting the general yin energy of the body, and raw beets can be good for supporting the spleen and strengthening the blood. Acupuncture works well for some people, as does cranio-sacral therapy, as in fact do most alternative methods aimed at rebalancing energy flow. But with all these suggestions, it's important to remember that rebalancing requires time - perhaps many menstrual cycles - and hence patience.</p> <p>As for the men, it's important for us to recognise the signs early and, above all, be willing not to take things personally. As you've no doubt heard countless times before, the best you can do when caught in hormonal crossfire is to ignore all missiles and shrapnel and go over and give her a tender, loving cuddle. Just don't expect a reward.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, My doctor believes I have gallstones and has referred me for a scan. The waiting list is one year. In the meantime, I am controlling the symptoms (pain under right ribs and vomiting) by reducing fat intake and following your advice to take fresh lemon juice in water, morning and night. My doctor expects I will need an operation to remove my gall bladder. Is there any alternative to this? I have been told that lemon juice will dissolve the stones. Is this correct? As I will be drinking lemon juice for 12 months, are there likely to be any harmful effects?<br><b> Jean Johnson, Lancashire</b></p> <p>Dear Jean, It is possible sometimes to dissolve gallstones with lemon juice, but it's not guaranteed. However, as you have to wait a year to be seen, and lemon juice in water twice a day is both helpful and harmless, it seems your best option for now. As for alternatives to surgery, obviously dietary advice from a nutritionist will be useful, as well as cranio-sacral therapy to keep the energy moving through the gall bladder. Learning to relax more generally will also help, as stress makes the gall bladder overheat. If, however, you do end up having surgery, be assured that this operation is highly successful and relatively easy on the body.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, Since the death of my son three years ago, I have developed various 'conditions' which I manage, except for tinnitus. This stops me from being able to spend quiet time to try and find some spiritual sense about what has happened to him - and to me. I have tried background tapes, but these seem to exacerbate the sounds rather than mask them. Do you have any suggestions? <br><b>Patricia Holmes, via email</b></p> <p>Dear Patricia, Tinnitus, unless caused by physical damage to the eardrum by loud noise, originates from low kidney energy, as the ears are said to be the flower of the kidneys. </p> <p>The trauma of your son's death must have significantly weakened the kidney energy. </p> <p>Press your thumbs into the ridges of muscle that run down either side of the spine around the kidney region (in the lower back) every day for a minute or so, especially in the late afternoon, when the kidneys are most susceptible. Also massage the ears themselves quite vigorously between thumb and finger to increase circulation. Consider visiting an acupuncturist, as tinnitus responds well to acupuncture.</p> <p>Barefoot Doctor is author of 'Handbook for the Urban Warrior' and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi.

  "<p>Even the quarterly forecast that uses the Treasury's own economic model is predicting that the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, will enjoy an 'embarrassing' budget surplus. The respected Ernst &amp; Young Item Club estimates it at some \u00a316 billion. </p> <p>The report forecasts growth of 3 per cent this year, falling back next year, but with inflation firmly under control. </p> <p>However, says author Professor Peter Spencer, the strong state of the public finances may endanger growth if the Chancellor continues to 'hoard' cash, such as the receipts from the third generation mobile phone licence auctions. </p> <p>He says: 'The war chest is so brim-full that it is threatening to sink the ship of state. The tax bonanza is a mixed blessing, because money is being raised through taxes, but that money is not being spent.' </p> <p>The predicted surplus, \u00a310bn above Budget estimates, will increase political pressure on the Chancellor to cut taxes and increase spending in the pre-Budget report, which is believed to be scheduled for 8 November. </p> <p>In fact, the Item Club stresses that there are economic risks in failing to pump such surpluses back into the economy, because of fragility in the corporate and household sectors. </p> <p>The main problem is the \u00a315bn deficit and a levelling off of investment in the companies sector, the report says. In addition, real household income is predicted to grow by only 2 per cent next year, even given an income tax cut of \u00a36bn. These factors make the UK economy more susceptible to shocks in the world economy, such as an enduringly high oil price or a slump in equity prices. </p> <p>Spencer disputed that using the surplus would add to inflationary pressures because 'the Chancellor would be simply putting money into the economy that he's already taken out'. </p> <p>The report suggests raising the threshold for upper rate tax bands in line with earnings and selected cuts to indirect taxes. </p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said that there was no special insight from use of the Treasury model and that its predictions depended on the economic assumptions made. </p> <p>Other analysts predict next month's pre-Budget Report will point to a one-off rise in the basic state pension, a small reduction in the excise duty on petrol for motorists, and an increase in the personal income tax allowance.</p>",
  "If you've got it all, then you need to prevent others getting their hands on it. You need a private army. First, your soldiers. In terms of salaries, here are some comparisons: a British Army private earns up to \u00a312,753; a major \u00a335,000. However, an experienced mercenary for the South African firm Executive Outcomes, which has worked for the Angolan and Sierra Leone governments, will be paid up to \u00a38,000 per month. <p>Now, the hardware: prices are given in dollars because these weapons are not widely available in the UK. The US Marines standard rifle is the 5.56mm M16A2. It can fire 800 rounds per minute, weighs 3.9kg with magazine, has a range of 800m and costs $586. A sound choice, or try a heavier machine gun, the 7.62mm M60E3 (think Rambo) at $6,000. The Heckler and Koch MP5-N is the benchmark submachine gun ($894) for close-quarter combat.</p> <p>A main battle tank, the 1,500 horsepower, 68 tonne M1A1, will be just $4.3m, and delivers a shell four kilometres. For everyday transport, the M998 Humvee is indispensable and reasonably priced at $50,000.

  "This week I saw three new patients who have just been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, a condition that affects more than 1.4 million people in the UK, including Steve Redgrave, the Olympic rower who recently won his fifth gold medal at Sydney. All three have Type II diabetes, which means that, unlike Redgrave, who has Type I diabetes, they don't need to have insulin injections because the pancreas is able to produce sufficient insulin with the help of tablets. Other people who have Type II diabetes can control their blood-sugar levels without medication simply by monitoring what they eat. <p>Diabetes is characterised by an increased amount of sugar in the blood, caused by insufficient levels of insulin, the sugar-processing hormone, in the body. When the pancreas is performing properly after you've eaten food containing sugar, your blood-sugar level rises, whereupon the pancreas releases insulin to help the body's cells absorb and use the sugar, causing your blood-sugar level to return to normal. If you have diabetes, however, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to assist the cells to absorb sugar, with the result that the sugar remains in the blood. In Type II diabetes, this occurs either because the pancreas has become tired (more common in older people) or because the cells, particularly fat cells, are unable to take up the sugar (this usually occurs in people who are overweight). </p> <p>Most overweight Type II diabetics can control their blood-sugar levels better when they lose weight - because the strain is taken off the pancreas, thereby improving the body's ability to use the small amounts of insulin it produces. By improving the blood's fat profile and blood pressure, losing excess fat also reduces heart disease - a significant boon, as diabetics are roughly twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease as other people. But don't crash diet, as this will cause you to gain weight rapidly once you start eating normally and your metabolic rate has recovered, and can also destabilise your blood-sugar levels. </p> <p>Whether you lose weight or not, the key to living well as a diabetic is sticking to a healthy eating pattern, which can include eating foods that contain sugar. Avoiding such foods is not only unnecessary, as your body can learn to tolerate sweet foods when eaten correctly, but almost impossible in practical terms. In addition, if you avoided foods whose labels say that they contain sugar, your diet would be too restricted. You can discount the presence of sugar in savoury foods, as the quantities are so small that they shouldn't affect your blood-sugar levels adversely. Just have small meals within a balanced diet consisting of plenty of vegetables, fruit, lean proteins, wholegrains and water, and you should feel and stay well. As long as you don't binge on fruit, your blood-sugar levels should remain within the ideal limits; grapes and bananas, for example, don't contain too much fructose (fruit sugar) for diabetics. If you start experiencing an unquenchable thirst, check your blood-sugar level: it could be that it is too high, in which case your diet and/or medication may need adjusting. </p> <p>Although almost every person who has diabetes can eat sweet foods, you must accept that they raise your blood-sugar level. If you eat too many biscuits, chocolates or sugar-coated cereals, for example, your blood-sugar level will shoot up, causing you to feel ill and ultimately to gain weight. I recommend that you occasionally enjoy small amounts of sweet foods at meal times, making sure your meal also contains fibre (found in vegetables, wholegrains and pulses), to cushion the effect of the sugar. For instance, instead of having a doughnut in the middle of the afternoon, save it until after your evening meal. </p> <p>In fact, the ideal sweet foods for everyone, diabetic or not, are those that also contain some fibre, as these are gently absorbed by the body, discouraging wild blood-sugar swings and giving your body additional benefits including reducing the risk of developing heart disease and certain forms of cancer. So opt for cakes and desserts made with wholemeal flour, such as carrot cake or an apple and blackberry crumble topped with wholemeal flour. Note that artificial sweeteners like saccharine, aspartame and sorbitol can also give you wind and diarrhoea when eaten in excess. </p> <p>The type of fat consumed also has a major impact on a diabetic's health. Monounsaturated fats, found in nuts such almonds and cashews, avocados and olive oil, are the gold-medallists in the health stakes, while polyunsaturated fats, in corn and sunflower oil, receive the silver. The fats to watch are saturated animal fats such as diary and fatty meat products including sausages and pies, which have a greater tendency to fur up diabetic blood vessels.</p> <p>Because fat of any sort is a concentrated form of calories, if you are watching your weight, control the amount you eat and limit salt levels, as too much can irritate your blood vessels and lead to hypertension and heart disease. Instead, use herbs, garlic, spices and black pepper to spice up your life.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Faith in the Nation </strong> R2 </p> <p><strong> In The Psychiatrist's Chair </strong> R4 </p> <p><strong> Dorothy: A Manager's Wife </strong> R4 </p> <p>What is the meaning of life? And, more important, what is the meaning of death? Two questions that were explored in <strong> Faith in the Nation </strong> on Sunday and answered in Radio 4's afternoon play on Tuesday. </p> <p>Emily Buchanan, BBC religious affairs correspondent, hosted Sunday's uplifting programme, which took in opinions and beliefs about the afterlife from the mainstream faiths. </p> <p>A less than comforting scenario came from Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra of the Islamic faith who believes if you are bad you are punished in hell, a place full of 'all the horrible, terrible things you can imagine... blood and puss to drink, thorny bushes to eat'. </p> <p>Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, offered a less vindinctive approach, suggesting that heaven and hell occurs at the moment of death - the reflection of how you have lived your life. </p> <p>My favourite interpretation came from the Buddhist belief that true enlightenment can be found through deep meditation. Not only did Buddha get the chance to sit under a tree for years, but he was able to come to the happy conclusion that everything is changing and nothing is fixed - our minds, the universe. These changes take place depending on a preceding action and we can make changes for the better, eventually achieving, nirvana, or enlightenment. </p> <p>A full-length version of Phil Collins's 'I Can Feel It Coming in the Air Tonight', was beautifully calming and prepared the listener for the Humanist view of the afterlife. Robert Ashby, executive director of the Humanist Society, believes that one day science and faith will come up with an answer. But until that moment, we each latch on to the afterlife explanation that suits us best. For him the thought of eternity is frightening: 'I gain some confidence and strength,' he said, 'from the belief that when I am dead, I am dead. There is nothing beyond. This life counts, don't worry about what is after, there is nothing.' </p> <p>One woman who could have contributed to this discussion is Professor Susan Greenfield, the subject of <strong> In The Psychiatrist's Chair</strong>. A leading researcher into the brain and, as Anthony Clare describes her, 'a celebrity scholar', she seemed reluctant to talk in depth about herself. If we are to believe what she told us, she has no worries, 'worry is a negative energy' and the only feelings she cannot control are those of excitement and impatience. When Clare asked her probingly 'Do you ever feel drained?' she replied yes and was giving up coffee. It was not the answer I was hoping for. </p> <p>Perhaps I had been carried away by questions of the soul and immortality, but I desperately wanted to know what she felt about life and death knowing what she does about the brain. </p> <p>Disappointingly, Green-field came across as a well-balanced, confident woman who knows what she wants and plans to cram in as much as she can before she dies so she has no regrets at her moment of death (she too must have listened to Faith in the Nation). </p> <p>With thoughts of making the most of our lives, it was at first depressing to listen to the afternoon play, <strong> Dorothy, A Manager's Wife</strong>. Dorothy (Pauline Collins) was widowed at 26 and later married Billy (Timothy West), a famous footballer and manager. Her life has been wasted on bitter feelings of injustice and hatred of her ignorant footie-mad husband. All she now wanted was a bungalow and a garden. </p> <p>But this play was far more profound than it could possibly have aimed to be. It did, in a way, answer the question of the meaning of life for some. It is football. In Billy's words: 'It's my life, I can't do without it; without it, I'm nowt.' </p> <p>\u0095 Sue Arnold is away</p>",
  "This we know: we're stressed-out, debt-ridden, exhausted. We have less time for our families than we feel we should have. We take fewer pleasures from our entertainments and consumptions than we expected to take. We feel less connected to our communities than we ever did. In our workplaces, we subject ourselves to routines and duties which at best seem pointless, at worst unethical or immoral. Yet we also feel like hollow citizens, too weary to respond to any political entreaty with anything other than a shrug. In short, we are workers. <p>Yet why do we meekly accept this condition, when our brave new technological future - the amazing potential still to be unleashed in computers, genetics and molecular engineering - could change it utterly? Why, with all this power at our disposal, do we still feel like mere objects ourselves? </p> <p>But this is how the work ethic continues to grip us. It doesn't matter how many machines could do our more tedious mental and physical labours. Forget the promise of the future, or even the possibilities of the present. Too many of us still regard turning up for work, however dispiriting or futile, as the very mark of inclusion and legitimacy, the measure of our moral fibre. 'I put in the hours, therefore I am.' </p> <p>Anything beyond the steely certainties of the work ethic seem either frightening or flaky: the oblivion of no job, the insecurity of self-employment, the turpitude of domesticity. So the treadmill is wearily mounted, once again - in absence of any alternative vision. Yet why believe in work, when work doesn't believe in you? </p> <p>The constant watchwords of the new capitalism are flexibility, creativity, self-improvement. Workers are urged to 'get up to speed' with a runaway world: we must become mobile and tensile, enterprising and capable. Yet these injunctions come from companies which hire you for a year, six months, maybe even less; which might be taken over at any time; which try to wriggle out of long-term entanglements such as pensions, wage and holiday agreements; and which shed labour whenever there's a dip in the markets. Trying to excel for companies that are themselves transient, provisional and unforgiving will one day seem like the grandest folly. </p> <p>When that realisation comes - that is, when the work ethic crumbles - then an intellectual vacuum will open up at the heart of contemporary capitalism, and we'll need a Big Idea. Over the last decade, we've already seen a procession of not-big-enough ideas - 'downshifting', 'work-life balance', all those slackers and idlers. None of them with much success or distinction. </p> <p>They all try to speak to our deep common anxiety: that if we keep up our loyalty to the work ethic, in a world where competition, mutability and innovation rule supreme, we will destroy ourselves. </p> <p>The LSE's Richard Sennett calls this the 'corrosion of our characters' - where the acids of the new capitalism eat away at the old industrial virtues of self-discipline, sacrifice and duty. </p> <p>What we need is a new, similarly powerful social ethic for these hyper-demanding times. Some other world view that can give meaning to our busy lives. Something that could make all these demands for 'creativity' and 'achievement' worth the effort. </p> <p> <b> I play, therefore I am</b> </p> <p> Welcome to the play ethic. First of all, don't take 'play' to mean anything idle, wasteful or frivolous. The trivialisation of play was the work ethic's most lasting, and most regrettable achievement. This is 'play' as the great philosophers understood it: the experience of being an active, creative and fully autonomous person. </p> <p>The play ethic is about having the confidence to be spontaneous, creative and empathetic across every area of you life - in relationships, in the community, in your cultural life, as well as paid employment. It's about placing yourself, your passions and enthusiasms at the centre of your world. </p> <p>By clearing space for activities that are pleasurable, voluntary and imaginative - that is, for play - you'll have better memory, sharper reasoning and more optimism about the future. As Brian Sutton-Smith, the dean of Play Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, says, 'The opposite of play isn't work. It's depression. To play is to act out and be wilful, exultant and committed, as if one is assured of one's prospects.' </p> <p>So to call yourself a 'player', rather than a 'worker', is to immediately widen your conception of who you are and what you might be capable of doing. It is to dedicate yourself to realising your full human potential; to be active, not passive. </p> <p>The play ethic is what happens when the values of play become the foundation of a whole way of life. It turns us into more militant producers and more discriminating consumers. It causes us to re-prioritise the affairs of our hearts, to upgrade the quality of our emotional and social relationships. It makes us more activist in our politics, but less traditional in their expression. And most of all, the play ethic forces us to think deeply about how we should pursue our pleasures - and how we reconcile that with our social duties. </p> <p>So, just like the work ethic, the play ethic is a set of feelings and principles. But the difference between the two is huge. Work is always (to coin a phrase) the involuntary sector - the realm of necessity, where men and women have to do what they have to do. But as Sartre says, play is what you do when you feel at your most free, your most voluntary. </p> <p>When every positive decision you make about your life carries both a risk, and a promise, of something new and challenging taking place. This is why the play ethic isn't 'the leisure ethic': the last thing it involves is slumped relaxation. </p> <p>Ever since the 'Protestant ethic' achieved its dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries - making sure that workers turned up at the factory gates every morning - work has tried to keep play's unpredictable energies at bay. </p> <p>Play has been corralled into the pen of 'leisure' and 'entertainment' - the workers' playtime, where we undergo 'recreation' for the next day's grind. Or it has been infantilised as an immature state of being, a permissible excess in the young, which all serious adults must put behind them. Or play has erupted through the cracks of our well-managed lives, as a series of counter- culture movements in the West - from the beats to the hippies, from punks to the ravers, from 'no future' to 'no logo'. </p> <p>Yet it's only over the last half-decade or so that the conditions have been ripe for the values of play to assume their rightful place in modern life. This is the grand loosening-up of Western societies, under the pressures of feminism, market forces, and latterly our powerful new technologies. These pressures have untied all those constraints of class, gender and identity which secured our loyalty to the work ethic. Men and women now live in 'risk societies', where so many more choices and decisions have to be made about life. What do I need to survive? Is this safe to eat? Should I stay with this person? What am I going to do now? </p> <p>Never before in history have so many individuals felt so individualised. We are 'developing a feeling for freedom', in the words of the German sociologist Ulrich Beck. But the values of work throw a damp, heavy blanket over that development. The work ethic was always about battering down our responses, regimenting out behaviour - all those Christian inhibitions that were drilled into the 18th and 19th century worker, so that he could divide himself (and his labours) for the better workings of industry. Being a player, by contrast, is about the freedom to be inventive, nurturing and modern. </p> <p> <b> Brave new office</b> </p> <p> Why must we kill ourselves... for work? The play ethic is an attempt to kick-start a new conversation about how we bring creativity and dynamism into the heart of everyday life. We can start the conversation in one obvious place - with the overlords of the new capitalism, both in politics and business. Stop trying to corrode our characters, in Richard Sennett's words - and start helping us evolve and strengthen our characters. </p> <p>If we need to 'get up to speed', then give us the right kind of vehicle, with the best possible fuel, to accelerate. Don't use your powerful technologies to regiment and discipline us, to squeeze more work out of fewer numbers and discard the remainder: use them to liberate as many people as possible into lives of self-determined activity and increasing fulfilment. Treat us as players rather than workers, and the promise of this new century might well be realised. Believe in us, and we might believe in you. </p> <p>The play ethic holds out the chance that people can indeed increase their capacity to cope with this intrinsically demanding future. But if we're going to advance ourselves, we can't do it by ourselves. To be blunt, a world fit for players won't happen without a huge and visionary reinvestment in the public sector, and an even greater rethink of standard business practice - both taking the maximisation of human potential as their aim. Yet the movements in this direction so far have been pathetically inadequate. </p> <p>We need the kind of tax-and-spend policies which would frighten the horses of the Treasury (despite the fact that each of these ideas are well-represented in the mainstream media and politics of mainland Europe and Scandinavia). </p> <p>But that's not all. We'd need a welfare system that invested in and sustained our non-working lives, rather than distrusted and demonised them. And a powerfully comprehensive education system, funded way beyond current levels, aimed at establishing an 'intellectual democracy'. And an employment policy which set industry-wide targets for a progressive reduction of the working week to 35 hours, with no loss of pay. </p> <p>On this, the politics of the play ethic is unashamedly democratic. It's the majority of the population, not just the much-vaunted 'knowledge elites', who should get to be players. Reducing work hours is one way (among others) of sharing out the 'clever' jobs. </p> <p>And no one should doubt that employment will be getting cleverer and cleverer. As US technology critic Jeremy Rifkin says, the industries of the 21st century won't require a mass labour force. 'But they will require the best minds working together with very sophisticated software and wetware - computer and genetic technology. The Industrial Age ended slave labour. The biotech and infotech century is going to end mass wage labour. So what are we going to do with everybody?' </p> <p>'We don't have a social and political vision', continues Rifkin, 'that is powerful enough to match these new technologies. We can't imagine what human beings could do if they're not needed in the marketplace or for government service.' </p> <p>The play ethic is exactly that vision - an attempt to imagine what human beings could do under these coming conditions. Not slumped in front of the television, not lost in a narcotic stupor, not listless or apathetic or passive - but an imaginative, engaged and active citizenry. Active because motivated, and motivated because there is an intimate, enriching connection between who they really are, and what they actually do. In the words of Brian Sutton-Smith, 'Play as the action in which we truly live.' </p> <p> <b> All power to the soulitariat!</b> </p> <p> So who's playing right now? Has anyone escaped the bonds of the work ethic and broken through to the other side? </p> <p>At the beginning of this new century, the social group that seems to be playing for keeps is the digital generation. For them, play is naturally what you do with your world: there's no angst or self-loathing about it. The technology that hovers like an axe over the neck of the traditional worker is more like a toy for them - a means of empowerment, not exploitation. They've left for the Playstation, these screenagers and cybernauts, and they're never coming home. This is the generation that was allowed to download their lives for free - browsers for nothing, web-mail for nothing, bootlegged software for nothing. So they've already got a weird, almost dotcommunist sense of property rights, which subverts the work ethic at its core. </p> <p>When the Net-Gens graduate from college, and go to the job market, the first thing they do is play around with the idea of a career itself. As a recent Industrial Society report says, these 'free workers' also want to find an emotional content in the work they're doing. They wish to cut deals with employers that maximise their control of their time, their environment, their personal commitments. They don't believe that fun and pleasure should be confined to after-hours: they want it when they draw a wage as well. </p> <p>They are neither the yuppies of the 80s, nor the downshifters of the 90s. They are eager to take all the opportunities that the new network society can offer, but wise enough to realise that wage-labour is only one strand in their life stories. </p> <p>We've been struggling to describe them over these last few years - Gen-X to Gen-Y, alt.dots to screenagers. Let's risk another term, which tries to express their playful balancing of employment, environment and experience. The bearers of the play ethic, right at the heart of the new economy, are a different kind of worker: not proletarians, but 'soulitarians'. These are the backpackers of Alex Garland's The Beach , using cheap flights and travel literature to make the world their playground. These are the ravers who grew up, but who can't (and won't) forget those blissed-out moments of transcendence, when drugs and beats blurred the boundaries of their selves. </p> <p>Great experiences matter to soulitarians as much as cool commodities. In the late 50s, the radical historian EP Thompson anticipated this in his famous essay on Time and Industrial Capitalism . Musing on what a post-work society might be like, Thompson suggested that its rhythms might rely 'neither upon the seasons, nor upon the market, but upon human occasions'. Which has happened: the soulitarian is above all a connoisseur of 'human occasions', from festival to tourist trail, from anti-corporate carnival to urban hang out. </p> <p>True players wield a huge bargaining chip in their dealings with the new capitalism. They understand the core political fact of the knowledge economy: you need my brains, and my heart, and my willingness, more than I need your money and security. </p> <p>The soulitarians happily flit between start-up and corporation, self-employment and job-sharing, being paid in cash and being paid in kind. If and when they work, they work because they want to. </p> <p>The fact is that you don't have to be a dotcommer to be a player. It remains the case that almost everybody can be a soulitarian. The work ethic was essentially mind control: industry had to find a way to exploit the worker's body - so it had to tether his or her mind with a whole weight of guilt, shame and status. But now the worker's body is useless, replaced by ever smarter machines, industry is left with the workers' mind to exploit - and that's proving extremely difficult. For every time you ask a mind to reskill and upgrade, you make that mind more aware of its singular talents, subtler in its workings - and, therefore, more demanding about the life it wants to lead. The 'smart' workers are getting too smart for their own good. </p> <p> <b> Play times</b> </p> <p> So the play ethic can be embraced by more than the digital generation, those dotcom munards playing the future with their mouses and joysticks. Behind the soulitarians are the lifestyle militants. They are older; more conventionally employed in the information industries; mostly parents with children, but singletons and post-marrieds, too. </p> <p>For them, being a player is about civilising the workplace, and then about putting work in its proper place. With employers, their demands are for virtual working rather than presenteeism, for collegiality over hierarchy, for information-sharing over empire-building. They want more free time because, with all their accumulations of children and partners, skills and experiences, they 'want a life'. And with the half-way point approaching soon, they're becoming militant in their pursuit of happiness. </p> <p>When our non-work lives become more significant than our work lives, we become less tolerant of our office pathologies - the power-games, the sharp practice, the empty values. The play ethic raises the stakes here: to be a player is to be confident enough in one's abilities to seek the best possible environment for paid employment - either by kicking up a fuss in the organisation, or hap pily moving outside it into self-employment (becoming a consultant, a freelancer, or starting your own company). Meaningful work and serious play become the same thing. </p> <p>Lifestyle militants come in many stripes, and with diverse motivations. For example, many women battling for workplace recognition of their parental responsibilities have been delighted by the increasing amounts of working fathers also joining the fray. </p> <p>But it's still a gentle tide, rather than a thundering advance. And perhaps one reason for this tentativeness is that masculinity in the UK is a mess. It's wandering somewhere between New Man, Old Man and New Lad. British men are cripplingly divided about their responsibilities to their partners, their children and their communities. In fact, it's rare to find men even willing to discuss these issues among themselves. </p> <p>Play might well be one new way of enlisting men in the battle for more free time. The wager might be: what happens when all work and no play makes Jack a bad father? As Anthony Clare points out in his recent book on masculinity, there are specific skills that men can bring to the nurturing of their children - vigorous games, fiddly projects on table tops, trainspotterish enthusiasms. </p> <p>One way to turn a recalcitrant father into a radical father might be to appeal to the permanent big kid inside him: it's ethically right to want to play with your children, to enjoy that activity in and for itself. If that doesn't place men side by side with women in the battle for more parental rights, nothing will. </p> <p>Of course, the fields of play extend wider than the family. Recent months have brought news of a backlash against parents rights: non-parents are beginning to complain about having to 'cover' for their parental colleagues, posing very uncomfortable questions for their employers. If John and Mary can get time for their children - whether they're sick, running in the school races, or grappling with Lego - why can't I get an equal amount of time off work? </p> <p>Proponents of the play ethic would answer: well, why not indeed? If we understand play as the exercise of human freedom and self-fulfilment, from birth to death, then of course the playtime of the childless and the single should be equally rated. Rather than set themselves against radical parents, the 'child-free' advocates should join with them. Together, they could make a powerful common front for more humane employment conditions in the mainstream of the new capitalism. </p> <p>The idea of 'downshifting' always had the faint implication of stepping back from an active life. The play ethic isn't for 'voluntary simplicity', but for voluntary complexity. That famous 'juggling act' - between work and non-work, individual and community, pleasure and duty - should be something which we enjoy rather than rue. But only because we've been to the best juggling schools that money can buy. Which makes us skilled enough to pick up the clubs when they fall, and get back in the ring, along with all the other acrobats, tumblers and trapeze artists. </p> <p> <b> Playing hardball</b> </p> <p> At this point, one can distinctly hear the hooting derision of the employers' organisations, several leading politicians, and maybe one or two trade union leaders. The play ethic! Good old British shirk ethic more like. Isn't this an argument for the return of the Skivers' Charter? </p> <p>Yet the play ethic isn't anti-capitalism, but capitalist reform - and it's no less urgent for that. Like the work ethic was in its own time, the play ethic is a sincere attempt to legitimise a specific economic order. </p> <p>The policy goals of the play ethic aren't rocket science: all have their benchmarks in normal European politics. Harmonising with France and Italy on a strict 35-hour week, which comes into full operation in both countries on 1 January 2001, is an obvious opportunity. </p> <p>The French experience has been mostly a political success: reducing unemployment, redistributing the smarter work among a wider social class, and even increasing productivity levels (by trading shorter hours for more flexible work patterns at no loss of pay). Yet, more importantly, it has released millions of French citizens back into their own lives - with time to socialise, spectate, self-improve. As Lionel Jospin says: market economy, not market society. </p> <p>The next target is a continent-wide citizen's income, guaranteed to all, bundling all existing benefits and tax credits into one payment. Here, the play ethic respectfully asks that the rhetoric of the Third Way line up with reality. How can those lower down the income scale be expected to become 'enterprising' and 'dynamic', embracing all the risks of the age, when one step away from paid employment sends them either into economic debt, or marks them with the stigma of welfare dependency? </p> <p>Reskilling, taking several jobs in a lifetime, adapting to different styles of working - this is all about work as a discontinuous, constantly uneven and surprising realm. How can this discontinuity be made an opportunity rather than a threat? We can only all be players if we are enabled to be so. </p> <p>Beyond the French-Italian axis, countries such as Holland and Denmark have had success with their systems of 'voluntary unemployment': every worker having the right to one year's leave in their working life, distributed as they see fit, with a state payment at somewhere around 60 to 70 per cent of their original wage. Apart from maintaining high-employment levels - and no noticeable reduction in national productivity - a citizen's wage enables people to feel that their non-work lives are socially esteemed. </p> <p>The last obvious policy is in education. There is already a gathering counter- consensus in the UK around educational reform, led by voices such as Tom Bentley of Demos, CreativeNet and the Scottish Council Foundation: they want to stop 'factory schools turning out factory minds'. The creative child can imagine new problems (rather than have them handed down to them); mingles ideas easily from one realm to another; makes mistakes, as long as they lead to more interesting solutions; and focuses on goals with all their powers of attention. That's a textbook list of the psychological attributes of play. </p> <p>Yet creative education should be about more than producing fodder for the 'creative industries', or a better class of info-worker. The democratisation of creativity could save lives - or, at a minimum, turn those lives away from self-destruction. If the play ethic means anything tangible, it is about occupying the gap that drug culture occupies in our poorest communities. And that gap is created by the distance between 'work' as it stands - Job-Seekers' Allowances, McEmployment of all kinds, the spiritual tedium of 'workfare' Britain - and the individuals who cannot (or will not) conform to its dictates. </p> <p>Drugs, you could say, are the dream-seekers' allowance: the most expedient way to boost your sense of human potential, when all the official routes heading towards that end seem rubble-strewn, or impossibly long, or depressingly unrewarding. What Ibiza has really 'uncovered', for all its reckless, oafish hedonism, is an inarticulate but deeply-felt rejection of the false dignities of contemporary labour. 'I'm largin' it' should be taken literally: it means 'My precious self is bigger than this mousy, pointless social role.' </p> <p>An education for creativity which wanted to be truly 'inclusive' would have to listen to this elemental and popular desire for playfulness. It's linked to an earlier, more carnival- esque Britain, evidently not entirely swept away by industrial capitalism. A time of 'happy Mondays' and 'the soul's play-day', when 18th-century Gloucester bishops complained about 'loutish mobs that are drunk with the cup of liberty'. </p> <p>Teachers would have to find ways to tap into these disruptive energies, and turn them into a repertoire of usable life skills. That means, among other new approaches, that the much-abused 'media and cultural studies' would at last get its proper curricular due. Bringing context and history to pop songs, computer games and tabloid TV could provide kids with an exit route from the cul-de-sac of these escapisms, into richer areas of cultural tradition and understanding. </p> <p>Economists who've read their Marx often talk about education as part of the 'reproduction of labour' - the place where the character of the good worker is made. The play ethic wants an education which aims at the reproduction of creativity, the nurturing of the good player's soul. Children should leave schools feeling motivated, in command of their faculties and capable of expressing themselves in ways which both please themselves and others. Why would such a child choose the temporary utopia of drugs over the actual joys of skilful self-creation? Why would they not choose to play? </p> <p> <b> Playing for keeps</b> </p> <p> Yet if arguments from the mainstream won't convince our new capitalist establishments of the need for serious reform, then perhaps a revolt from the margins will. The waves of anti-corporate and anti-globalisation demonstrations over the past 18 months, from Seattle to Prague, should be warning enough to the new capitalist establishment: they need to change their ways, and fast. If any movement takes the values of play to their most militant political conclusion, it's the 'no-logo' radicals so ably described by Canadian author Naomi Klein. </p> <p>They rub global brands such as Starbucks, Nike and Gap in their own exploitative dirt. And by doing so, they withdraw their consent from the new capitalism, in exactly the ways they need it most: from the head and the heart. We're not going to play your games anymore. We're going to play our own. </p> <p>And play they do - from their use of the net to co-ordinate global protest, to their subversion of billboards and public advertising; from the rave atmosphere of their street protests, to the humour and wit of their sloganeering. It's the combination of spontaneity and absorption, of applied creativity and voluntary action - in short, their identity as players - that defines their politics. How must those corporate marketeers who are trying to calculate the 'lifetime value' of future generations feel about these young semiotic terrorists, these gleeful 'non-sumers', who merrily puncture brands like balloons? </p> <p>The anti-globalisers are still groping for an overall theory, or a defined political programme. Yet, as they do, they should look beyond their own tribes - environmentalists, trade-unions, third-world-firsters, disgruntled students, the digitally disaffected - and realise how much change they could catalyse. </p> <p>At the moment the smashed shops and Monday-morning viruses to unsuspecting in-boxes (remember the 'I Love You' email?) are just shock tactics with diminishing returns. But, once the dust settles, what might the anti-capitalists bring to the politics of a play ethic? They might ask for fair trade, not free trade. For the use of information networks to co-ordinate global democracy, not just to facilitate the movements of global capital. For news media to reflect a much wider range of societal viewpoints. For marketing to talk about the efficiency, design and reusability of products - rather than emphasising the way they'll be the answer to our dreams. For political authority always to be justified, its legitimacy tested against the will of autonomous citizens rather than assumed. </p> <p>What's the alternative? That an aggressive, business-driven order provokes further resistance - which could be a destructive mixture of cyber-terrorism and social intolerance, the computer virus and the funda mentalist commune. A ghastly prospect. But not improbable. </p> <p>In the face of anti-capitalism, we have to devise a credible post-capitalism, a new balance between markets and society which can absorb all (or at least most) of the discontents that we all feel - from manager to tree- hugger, from worried mother to stressed worker. As a new 'spirit of capitalism' (to borrow from Max Weber), directing the new economy and its powers in the direction of human liberation, the play ethic has at least an even chance of striking that balance. </p> <p>Beyond all the high concepts, the vision of a more playful world speaks to something elemental within us. Perhaps it is because our earliest selves are painstakingly built from acts of play. The hand and eye following the mobile in the cot; the meal that becomes a table-top collage; the cardboard box that turns into its own, rickety universe. </p> <p>And perhaps it is no surprise that we adults feel tempted to suppress the intense, utopian joy of these memories. A time when the world was malleable, magical, under the thumb of our imaginations; a time when those around us were willing participants in the games and adventures of life, who shared our inexhaustible energies for the new and the challenging. </p> <p>The radicalism of the play ethic is that it asks us to seriously consider what the American constitution calls 'the pursuit of happiness'. And the roots of our happiness, surely, lie deep in our playful selves. As well as all the previous prescriptions, proposals and policies, we could do worse than to occasionally becalm ourselves and try to recover those early moments - when the art of life was easily learned and joyfully practised. </p> <p>So let's play. I believe it's our turn</p>",
  "<p><strong> Madame Melville </strong> Vaudeville, London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Napoleon </strong> Shaftesbury, London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Water/Wine in the Wilderness</strong> Tricycle, London NW6 <br></p> <p> <strong> Madame Melville</strong>, written and directed by Richard Nelson, is a discomfiting play, a chamber piece for three. It seems at first like laborious titillation: a Frenchwoman - a teacher of literature - seems intent on seducing a15-year-old American pupil, Carl. For Madame Melville (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), sexual power takes priority over everything else. Bonnard's paintings are precious to her only because they remind her of a former lover; to prepare for reading Proust, she declares, is like anticipating a honeymoon. </p> <p>Jacob plays her as an unlikeable but convincing type: intelligent, superficial, a damaged femme fatale. Behind the flirtation is a loneliness which will lead to something uglier - abuse. </p> <p>As Carl, Macaulay Culkin (the child star of Home Alone ) is brilliantly cast. He looks like a lost boy: his smile curving upwards and then losing its way; his fringe as much of a hindrance as his manner; awkward, young. Culkin's voice sounds dry and weak, like someone emerging from a bout of crying. Madame Melville does not want to hurt him, she says, but there is no sign of her having even ordinary care for him - she doesn't even make him breakfast. </p> <p>We are in uplifting rooms (designed by Thomas Lynch) with walls as blue as copper sulphate crystals and tall shelves filled with books. There are white balconies seemingly unsupported, as if emblematic of the sudden affair between the teacher and her 15-year-old pupil. There will be nothing to catch him when he falls. </p> <p>Nelson is most at home with an epic scale in his plays, but here, as in Goodnight Children Everywhere, he sustains intimate dramatic tension beautifully. The unease - the arid, disagreeable atmosphere - never lets up, though it is lightened by anarchic comic moments. </p> <p>It is arresting to see a play in which a woman through age (she is in her thirties) and status becomes as exploitative as any man, as culpable and as cold, even in her most tender gestures. Madame Melville and her friend Ruth (played with spirit by Madeleine Potter), who lives in the flat above, are like a pair of corrupt schoolgirls trying to reclaim a naivet\u00e9 they lost years ago. Ruth seems unhinged, a fiddler on the roof with an unhygienic lover and a family she has abandoned somewhere in the States. </p> <p>Carl may be consenting, but he is being played upon, none the less. Where does such a story come from? It reminded me of David Mamet's Oleanna - without the protest (and therefore more insidious). It is a kind of haunting, a comedy where there is no reason to laugh. It describes an affair: short, memorable, best forgotten. </p> <p>French seduction is the theme of the week in the London theatre. <strong> Napoleon</strong> is on the rampage at the Shaftesbury. He has become a softie, with a caramel for a heart. Hang on a minute though, he's changed. He is hard, authority personified. Or is he, in fact, mad - a deranged figure in an army coat? This Napoleon does not give up or add up. Paul Baker pours into the performance everything he has got but has more than the Alps to scale in Andrew Sabiston and Timothy Williams's new musical. </p> <p>When he first meets Josephine, she resists him briefly (the gist is: 'Not this afternoon, Bonaparte.') Anastasia Barzee sings her way out of trouble miraculously, making even the most hackneyed lyrics tolerable. She looks beautiful, exactly like David's portrait of Madame Recamier (she even has the couch to pine and recline on). Michael Yeargan's set and Marie-Jeanne Lecca's costumes are magnificent: energetically luxurious. Yards of scarlet velvet, mists, chteaux, armies on the march in elegant silhouette, images of history passing by. </p> <p>A virtue is made of vulgarity. A vast, hinged mirror swings upwards dramatically to reflect Josephine and Bonaparte in each other's arms. A suitably obsessive cartography dominates the design: Bonaparte takes possession of Josephine on a bed that doubles as a map, in a spirit of global domination. </p> <p>Francesca Zambello is a marvellous director of opera but although her talents - and that of her cast - are much in evidence, their gifts are squandered here. David Burt's Talleyrand, for example, is marvellously good, but he has nothing decent to sing. This epic story needs thrilling, capacious, heart-stirring music. It needs to match Boney's heroism. </p> <p>If only Verdi could rise from his grave and make his way down to the Shaftesbury with a new score under his arm. Then the present score and lyrics could be banished to St Helena. </p> <p>Seduction continues to be the theme at the Tricycle. A double bill explores blackness and the way in which it is subverted, often by black people themselves. Winsome Pinnock's <strong> Water </strong> is an interview between an artist (Cecilia Noble), whose sensational work is said to reflect her life, and a journalist (Gary McDonald). The artist seduces the journalist. </p> <p>It becomes clear that the artist is intent on seducing everyone else, too, with a calculated lie. She is experimenting with authenticity and expectation. Winsome Pinnock's control of struc ture, of shifts of tone and mood is impressive. At the heart of this play is rage - about valuing black people for the wrong reasons. </p> <p><strong> Wine in the Wilderness</strong> by Alice Childress, a playwright in her eighties who, as a young woman, was an actress in Harlem, is an interesting longer work, directed with flair by Nicolas Kent. </p> <p>An artist (Ricco Ross) is at work on a triptych about three faces of Africa: the child, the good woman and the fallen woman. His model for the third picture is Tommy (the mesmerising Jenny Jules). She moves like a hyperactive tennis player and has some extraordinary aces up her sleeve. She will change the way the painter sees. Both plays show most movingly that the flipside to rage is rejoicing - for the right reasons. </p> <p>\u0095 Susannah Clapp is away</p>",
  "<p>Marian Keyes opens the door to her large yellow Dublin house. Inside, it is all razzle-dazzle colour: rooms painted lilac, neon green, azure blue, stinging saffron, unapologetic pink. The sofas are in lime and violet. The rococo mirror is turquoise. She herself is dressed to match the vertical modernist radiators, in a vivid purple top; glowing. She is small, even in her black ankle boots. She has round, surprised eyes in a tiny pale face. Her abundant dark hair swishes across her painted-rosebud mouth. Her voice is light, quite high. 'Feck,' she says repeatedly in her Irish lilt. 'Jaysus.' </p> <p>The effect - of the house, of the woman - is not brazen or comic or over-the-top, but oddly consoling. The house, she explains, faces north and, when they bought it, was dark and gloomy; the gaudy colours brighten it up. And her books do the same: her quirky romantic comedies spring from emotions that are actually quite shocking in their violence and wretchedness. Marian Keyes might be a 'feel-good' writer, but she's feel-good with a difference. </p> <p>'Darkness goes alongside proper comedy,' she says. 'The best comedy is rooted in despair.' But, she adds, she believes in personal redemption. 'Oh Jaysus, I do. I have to, because it is miraculous what has happened to someone like me, who was so tormented for so long.' </p> <p>She makes me coffee in a cafetiere. She doesn't drink it herself, and she says that she spent the previous evening rehearsing the making of it for my visit. She watches me anxiously as I take a sip. She is nervous about her new book. She doesn't mind reviewers, but she doesn't want her readers to be disappointed - and she has a lot of readers. Marian Keyes is 37. She has written five novels in as many years. Her first, Watermelon, was published by Poolbeg, a small Irish press, and then snapped up in the UK, instantly galloping on to the bestseller list. Then came Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, Rachel's Holiday, Last Chance Saloon and, in two weeks' time, Sushi for Beginners, for which she received a four-book advance of over \u00a3600,000. Her books have sold nearly three million copies worldwide, they have been turned into television dramas and optioned for films. She is wealthy (the 67th richest woman in the UK) and famous: 'the hottest female writer in Britain,' says the publicity blurb. </p> <p>Her novels are often called 'women's fiction' and bracketed with writers like Jane Green or Helen Fielding. But where another heroine might worry about that extra glass of Chardonnay, Marian Keyes's will binge on nauseating amounts of food, three doughnuts and a loaf of bread, a packet of biscuits at a sitting. Where another heroine will wait to get her man, Marian Keyes's may wait and never get; may, indeed, discover that wanting a man is a frailty and an actual cause of her unhappiness. Her women get appallingly drunk, fake orgasms, throw themselves at men they despise and are repulsed by, sleep with each other's friends, hit their children, act in ways that unsettle our feel-good expectations. Rachel's Holiday is set in a rehab clinic and Rachel is a drug-addicted, self-denying, lying, infuriating mess. Often, her women are not in search of love so much as in search of, and in flight from, themselves. </p> <p>In Sushi for Beginners, Marian Keyes turns away from the stubbornly ordinary settings of her previous fictions to the world of a glossy magazine, but she demystifies the glamour. The three women at the centre of the book are discontented in familiar ways. They are all in search of happiness but looking in the wrong places, when, of course, the place they have to look is inside themselves. </p> <p>'I am interested in damage,' says Marian Keyes. 'I am an alcoholic and I can't drink again; I write what I find, not what I think other people will like, though if they like it I am delighted. I am interested in brokenness and addiction. I think we live in addiction-ridden times. I don't just mean drink and drugs. I also mean dysfunctional relationships, spending money, eating, exercise, anything. Maybe there's a spiritual vacuum that is the motor for these addictions. I write about ordinary, damaged people. Of course, that must have something to do with what has happened to me. I often think that there are some people who are born without one layer of skin; who have a propensity for pain, who don't deal with life in a resilient way. </p> <p>'I have a friend, Suzanne, who used to be my flatmate, and she's just a straightforward, grand person. Life bounces off her. I would have loved to have been like that; that joyous embracing of life. But I'm not. I'm me. And although I still have my bleak and terrible days, I feel more acceptance of myself. I don't regret anything, even the most painful things. </p> <p>'Nothing happened,' she says.' 'There's nothing I can find to explain why I was always so very unhappy. I had a good upbringing. I love my family. My parents weren't drinkers. I was the oldest of five, and I think I took the burden, and worried when I didn't need to. I was a grand worrier. I hated being late. I used to wear my nightie over my school uniform so I wouldn't be late for school. Insane. Nobody ever told me off, so where did that agonising self-consciousness and fear come from? Between the ages of eight and 11 my family moved a lot - from Cork to Galway and then to Dublin - and I felt an outsider. I never really settled. And my adolescence - well, Jaysus. Oh Jaysus.' </p> <p>Her hands float to her mouth with the agony of memory. 'I was small. I looked young. I was smart. That was a bad combination. People underestimated me, so I was angry. Angry and anxious - that's an even worse combination. I hated the way I looked. My siblings were all fine - my brother, who's three years younger than me, was affable and easy-going. My sister, who was four years younger, was chatty, charismatic; I was fiercely jealous of her. I knew I was different. Sometimes I wonder if I was clinically depressed then - I remember at 11 I had a constant feeling of screaming despair, I felt there was an ominous sky nailed two inches from my head. I didn't talk to anyone about the way I felt. I must have been ashamed. I thought that everything would be all right when I was an adult. It wasn't.' </p> <p>By the time she left school, she was drinking: 'It's not the amount that matters, it's the fact that it was important to me. I already didn't understand how you could drink and not want to get drunk. It was oblivion I was after. And I was different when I drank; I felt more like the person I thought I was supposed to be. I knew I was witty, quite perceptive, I could tell a good story, I was clever. But I always got in the way of myself.' </p> <p>She drank through her law degree. She came to London, decided not to be a lawyer, drank though her job as an accounts clerk. Drank more and more, 'pouring fuel on the flames of my misery'. Lurched through dysfunctional relationships, behaved badly, tested all her loyal friends. 'I still had an infrastructure to my life. There were people who were very concerned about me; my boss and colleagues were incredibly kind and patient. And Suzanne. I didn't understand - none of us understood - that I couldn't stop without help. It wasn't a question of willpower. I didn't know that one was too many and a thousand never enough; I didn't know I was an alcoholic, which seems absurd in retrospect, but denial grows in tandem with the disease, and as the drinking increases so does the need to protect it. I knew I was unhappy and I thought that without drinking I would have nothing at all. I was beaten by alcohol.' </p> <p>The final four months of her drinking were the 'saddest and most awful of my life. I was constantly suicidal and I finally tried to kill myself' - an attempt with alcohol and pills which led to her salvation. 'Perhaps it was my cry for help; I was so crazed with pain - the pain of being alive.' She came out of hospital and booked into a rehabilitation centre in Dublin, spent six weeks there - 'and that was enough to set me on the path, though I still go to self-help groups. I had never lived through anything painful without the help of drink. Every time I was anxious, I would drink. After the rehab, every time something happened and I dealt with it, I grew up a bit more. And it was difficult, but it felt fantastic as well, like learning to drive a car: Feck, I'm doing it. I'm doing it! Look! Taking responsibility for myself and my life. It was grand, wonderful.' </p> <p>In 1994 she returned to London, where she remained for three years, before going home to Dublin. She had already started to write when at her most depressed and addled - 'but now I took it seriously'. She also became involved with the man whom she was to marry. 'Tony had been a friend for a long time, we had a good foundation of kindness and being mindful of each other. And I no longer needed a relationship, which was why I could have a good one at last. Before, I'd always been looking for fixes. Now I was no longer angry or scared or desperate. I was being grown-up. I was writing. I felt clean, a fledgling adult.' The success of Watermelon took her by surprise. 'It was such a buzz, though - to have come from a place where I'd been so bereft and to have produced something I was delighted with and which had come from my quirky, tormented head. I thought: well now, it's OK to be me.' </p> <p>She continues to be surprised by her success. She thinks it is luck, and knows that one day her luck might go. When she was offered her second large advance, one of her friends burst into tears, saying: 'It's going to change everything.' But Marian Keyes insists that it hasn't. 'I'm not materialistic. I have what I want, I love my house, I love my car. I have money for family and people I am close to. I am aware that money can be a corrupting and destructive thing, and I am mortified that the people who sell and buy my books might feel I'm somehow not the same as them, and I am the same. I'm very close to my family, who treat me the same as they always have. I have a tight circle of friends. They are happy for me; they're secure in their own lives so why would they begrudge me? </p> <p>'People tell me I'm not going to win the Booker, and that's true, but there are different ways of having one's work validated. I respect what I do; I don't take myself seriously but I take my writing seriously. I'm not part of the Irish literary \"milieu\" [she puts on a fancy voice]. Jaysus, I'd be craven with fear. I stay close to my roots because that's where I'm happy to be. If my writing stopped, because I couldn't do it any more or because people no longer wanted to read it, I'd be upset. But there are other things in life. Travel - we could sell the house and buy a camper van. Or Tony and I both want to work with human rights somehow - we're bleeding-heart liberals really.' </p> <p>Three years ago, she and Tony bought this house, with its big rooms and a view (if you stand on tiptoes) of the sea. Tony - a Cambridge graduate and a computer analyst - gave up his work in order to work for her, 'clearing the decks' (she calls him 'ego-less' and says their working relationship is a 'partnership'). A year and a half ago - everything in place, the house decorated to make your eyes water, the room waiting - they started trying to have a baby. Nothing happened, and now they are seeing a specialist. 'It's like a syndrome,' she says. 'Women in their thirties who've put their families on hold, finding that it doesn't happen so easily. People tell me not to worry - but you know what, I'm not worrying. If it doesn't happen, I'll be very sad. And Tony, he'd be a wonderful father, he's so gentle, kind. But the two of us get on well and we will deal with it. I haven't written about it yet.' </p> <p>I ask what her next book is about and she says, 'It's about a woman who has had two miscarriages, and she's...' Her round eyes get rounder. 'Well. I never thought of that. Isn't that the strangest thing? So I am writing about it after all.' </p> <p>She insists that she will remain unaltered by success. 'I'm not better or worse for it, just luckier. And I've had to learn the dangers of not tying your self-esteem on to something that is so mutable. Failure is painful but survivable. I know that now. Shit happens to everyone. Sure, there'll be more shit coming my way. I just hope that now I can deal with it. I'm grateful for what I have, but it doesn't make me immune. Feck it, nobody is immune from life.' </p> <p>\u0095 To order Sushi for Beginners (Michael Joseph, \u00a316.99) for \u00a313.99, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</p>",
  "Divorce makes men richer and women poorer. The finding has astonished researchers involved in a major study of the effects over time on the partners of a failed marriage, and confounds the common belief that both partners suffer financially. <p>The research tracked 10,000 people over a decade and found that men's disposable income increases by an average of 15 per cent after divorce, while women see theirs fall by around 28 per cent, mirroring the average gain they experience on marrying. </p> <p>'Men bring more, economically speaking, to relationships and walk away with more, too,' said Dr Jonathan Scales, a research fellow at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, which carries out the British Household Panel Survey with the University of Essex. </p> <p>'This is the first time the effect of divorce on the same group of people has ever been tracked over a long period of time, and we were amazed by the results,' said Scales. </p> <p>The survey, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council with the support of the Future Foundation, returned each year from 1991 to question the same group of people about the effect on their lives of issues from the state of the labour market to workplace stress. </p> <p>The sharp difference in earnings between the sexes partly explains why women see their incomes fall so dramatically after divorce. Unmarried women earn, on average, around 14 per cent less than male colleagues. </p> <p>'There are also certainly divorced men who are getting their children brought up on the cheap,' said Scales, citing the Child Support Agency's report that only 48 per cent of absent fathers regularly pay full child support, while 29 per cent pay nothing at all. </p> <p>But divorce experts believe there are other more complex reasons why men's incomes increase so sharply in the wake of a divorce. </p> <p>'Divorce is a complete mess for women,' said Maryly La Follette, a partner at Charles Russell, divorce solicitors to Countess Spencer and Camilla Parker Bowles. 'I always tell husbands that they will have completely recovered from a divorce after five years and will probably be doing even better than before. </p> <p>'It's completely inevitable and has nothing to do with men hiding their assets or refusing to pay for children,' she added. </p> <p>'The odds of getting a fair divorce settlement are quite simply stacked against women.' </p> <p>To get what she is really owed, said La Follette, a woman must return to court every two or three years to fight out a new settlement to take account of increasing childcare and general costs. 'Very few women can afford or bother to return to court to achieve this. And while she loses out, he profits.' </p> <p>Gay Cox, a divorce expert at Family Mediation Scotland, said she had seen many cases where men's incomes have increased after their divorce. 'The earning capacity of divorced men increases for many reasons. There is such a fear of ending up poorer that newly divorced men frequently work their backs off to increase their earning capacity, taking advantage of the fact that there is now nothing to stop them working 18-hour days.' </p> <p>This work binge is often spurred by a fear that, if they lapse in their financial commitments, the men's former spouses may resort to using children as emotional blackmail, she maintains. </p> <p>About 141,000 divorces are granted in England and Wales each year, with around 12,000 in Scotland. On both sides of the border, courts compel the man to support his children until they have finished full-time education. </p> <p>Scottish courts calculate a 50-50 split between the couple's assets and compel men to support their ex-wives for three years after the settlement has been established, a recent change in the law which has made divorce cheaper for Scottish men, according to Cameron Fyfe, a senior partner in Glasgow's Ross Harper Solicitors who specialises in divorce and compensation cases. </p> <p>'This survey flies in the face of assumptions but adheres absolutely to my anecdotal experience,' he said. 'Women have a far higher earning capacity nowadays, which means that settlements are less draining for men than they once were. </p> <p>'And although both members of the failed marriage will be worse off immediately after the divorce, this new three-year limit means the strain on men's pockets is relatively short-lived.'</p>",
  "<p>The brain of a 70-year-old woman suffering from severe Alzheimer's disease has been brought back to life by a new drug, leading scientists to believe that the illness could be reversible. </p> <p>The researchers in Southampton showed that the drug Aricept revived whole regions of the woman's brain, leading to such a dramatic improvement in behaviour that her daughter declared: 'My mother is back!' </p> <p>New scanning techniques showed that the woman's brain had apparently irreparable damage to the cells controlling short-term memory and other thinking functions. Dr Paul Kemp of the University of Southampton said they gave the woman the drug for four months and scanned her again: 'It showed clearly that the cells we thought were dead were in fact lying dormant and could be switched back on.' </p> <p>The woman regained her memory, her ability to speak, and could again find her way around. Kemp said: 'It was a dramatic improvement - the Lazarus effect. She went from a severe form of dementia to a mild one.' </p> <p>Aricept has been used in the US for a few years, but is largely unavailable in the UK because health authorities claim it does not work. The respected Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin has said it had virtually no effect. In patients where the progress of the disease slowed, other factors were often held responsible. </p> <p>The new research, involving 25 patients, shows for the first time that Aricept can lead to a real physical improvement in the working of the brain. 'It's very scientifically objective, not a subjective clinical assessment,' said Kemp. 'It's a big step finding a drug that modifies the progression of the disease.' </p> <p>Alzheimer's so severely damages the areas of the brain that control memory, talking, thinking, and navigation that they are effectively 'turned off', and blood no longer flows to them. After a sustained course of Aricept the blood started flowing again. </p> <p>'It's like turning the tap back on. The damage was not permanent,' said Kemp. Previous research has suggested the drug can halt the progression of the disease only for around a year, and only in around a third of patients. </p> <p>But Kemp says the dramatic findings show how the drug works, so they can learn to target it better and even develop a cure for the disease, which afflicts 500,000 people in the UK. Ronald Reagan and Dame Iris Murdoch are well-known victims. </p> <p>The researchers hope treatment will follow a similar pattern to that of the previously untreatable Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's patients now are given dopamine, which arrests the development of the disease for decades. </p> <p>'Eventually sufferers will die with the disease, rather than of the disease. They will live so long they die of something else,' said Kemp. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Bill McQueen sits in his armchair tussling with the Daily Record crossword while his wife, Margaret, practises her cross-stitch at the kitchen table, occasionally casting a wary eye at the pot bubbling on the stove. <p>On the other side of their patio doors, the tall trees leading down to the water are starting to show off their autumn colour, glinting gold in the wet October sunlight. </p> <p>This weekend, as with every weekend for 17 years, the McQueens will be enjoying this cosy rural domestic bliss in a small wooden hut they built and cared for themselves at Carbeth, north of Glasgow. There, dotted around the undergrowth and invisible from the main road, is a tiny community of 150 green and brown huts which for 80 years have offered working-class Glaswegians a chance to escape city life and immerse themselves in some spectacular scenery. </p> <p>But all is not as tranquil as it seems. The McQueens and dozens of their fellow residents are embroiled in a bitter legal battle with the owner of the estate their huts stand on. A low-key local disagreement over increases in ground rent has escalated into one of the most vicious land disputes in modern Scotland. </p> <p>The hutters claim Allan Barns-Graham is trying to sweep them off the land in the name of profit; the landlord insists he is merely trying to make the estate pay its way. At stake are not just a few huts but a thread running right through the rich fabric of Glasgow working-class history. </p> <p>The first Carbeth huts were built in the 1920s when the current landlord's grandfather, Allan Snr, allowed ex-servicemen to use his land to leave behind - for weekends at least - the crushing poverty of urban life. In the 1930s they were used as a training camp by socialists preparing to join the International Brigade fighting Franco's fascists in Spain. In the 1940s, they became home to hundreds of families forced to flee the Clydebank blitz. </p> <p>Now the campers think there is a glimmer of hope. Next month, Stirlingshire council will be asked to make the Carbeth estate a conservation area. The hutters believe planning restrictions would then destroy any development plans by Barns-Graham who, they believe, wants to replace the huts with luxury tourist chalets. </p> <p>Barns-Graham said: 'That is just pure misinformation put out through sheer badness. If I wanted to get rid of the huts, I would have let the area continue into decline, when in fact I have done the opposite, spending a lot of money on improving the infrastructure.' </p> <p>But more than 80 of the hutters have received eviction notices from him after refusing to pay rent increases in some cases of up to 40 per cent. </p> <p>There have been 17 court cases, all of which have gone in the landlord's favour. The hutters have learned that even though they own the buildings, the landlord can take possession of them because he owns the land they stand on. </p> <p>By law, the McQueens should no longer be able to enjoy their long weekends at all; last year they lost their court battle against eviction after refusing to pay the increases which took their ground rent to \u00a3750 plus a \u00a3200 premium because their hut had a view of the loch. </p> <p>And when Barns-Graham refused the McQueens' request to be allowed to pay the bill for his legal costs in instalments, the retired joiner was made bankrupt at the age of 70. There was worse to come. </p> <p>Last summer, their hut and three others were burnt down. Fire brigade investigators found that petrol or some other accelerant had been used but no arrests have been made. With materials donated by their neighbours, they have managed to rebuild their hut. They know, however, that they are there on borrowed time. 'We are pensioners,' Mr McQueen said. 'I don't keep too well and neither does my wife. We've been coming here for 17 years, and we built that hut with our own hands. Yet he could send in the sheriff's officers and throw us out. It's a disgrace.' </p> <p>Barns-Graham has a very different version of events. 'This rent strike is being organised by a small minority who do not have the interests of the huts at heart. They are pursuing their own agenda, and that has been very damaging for Carbeth.' He has said that they were refusing to pay the rents simply because they wanted their holidays for free.</p>"
