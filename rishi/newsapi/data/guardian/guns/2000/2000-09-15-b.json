  "<p>Entrepreneur Philip Green yesterday bolstered the top management of his Bhs retail chain in a move regarded as a precursor to a stock market flotation of the troubled high street group. </p> <p>The appointment of Terry Green to Bhs is expected to mark a radical change in image for the middle-market chain. He left Debenhams as chief executive earlier this week. </p> <p>City sources said they expect Terry Green to use his experience in the retail industry to take Bhs - once known as British Home Stores - more up market and compete with ailing retailer Marks &amp; Spencer on the high street. </p> <p>Such a move was regarded yesterday as a way for Philip Green to keep his bid ambitions for M&amp;S alive. The industry remains sceptical about Philip Green's ability to raise the funding, perhaps as much as \u00a310bn, to launch a full scale bid for M&amp;S. </p> <p>The new but long-rumoured appointment is also regarded by industry experts as evidence of the difficulties Bhs has been facing on the high street since Philip Green bought it from Storehouse for \u00a3200m six months ago. </p> <p>One senior source said: \"We expect them to float Bhs on the stock market and turn the company against M&amp;S by using Terry Green's experience to put in designer brands.\" </p> <p>After months of speculation that the two men would soon be working together, Philip Green said he was \"delighted\" to have lured Terry Green, to whom he is not related, to Bhs. </p> <p>Philip Green acknowledged that Bhs needed a new direction to make more profits. He said the group was making \u00a31bn of sales but that a quarter of its potential retail space was not being used. </p> <p>In the year to April 1, the period before Philip Green took control, Bhs made an underlying profit of \u00a313.1m. \"This appointment shows our serious intent for Bhs to be a leading catalyst in the retail industry,\" Philip Green said. \"Bhs has been suffering from a lack of direction. It's not short of customers. We've got plenty of footfall.\" He played down any plans to try to raise the financing to bid for M&amp;S, saying \"My concentration is on Bhs.\" </p> <p>Philip Green, who is based in Monaco, admitted however that a stock market flotation of Bhs might be considered, once the retailer was back on track. </p> <p>\"(The flotation) won't be in the coming months. We do not have a plan today other than to get it back on track. We'll review our position. It's an option. Not the only option.\" </p> <p>Amid speculation that Philip Green would eventually take on M&amp;S , he said that he regarded all retailers as competitors. But, he said: \"We are going to develop a quality, value proposition. We believe that customers want choice, variety and great value.\" </p> <p>Terry Green, who left Debenhams after 12 years this week, said: \"I am excited by the Bhs brand and the strength of its customer loyalty, timing is everything thing. Bhs has been snoozing and represents one of the most rewarding challenges in retail today.\" Terry Green, who had also been cited as a potential candidate to run M&amp;S, is said to have been lured from Debenhams to Bhs on a lucrative incentive package. He led Debenhams through its demerger from the Burtons group.</p>",
  "<p>There's bad news for day-time television viewers. The party political conference season is about to begin, promising three weeks of afternoon viewing which combines the anarchic spontaneity of Songs of Praise with the wit and warmth of the Shopping Channel. </p> <p>If you're irresistibly attracted by the sound of people patting themselves on the back you might be tempted to sign up and join one of these parties. But what are the costs of becoming politically active? And never mind what they're offering the country, what have they got for their own members?</p> <p>For \u00a317.50 (\u00a36 unwaged and pensioners) you could join Labour. This entitles you to membership of the Labour party travel club (currently offering trips to Las Vegas and the Dominican Republic) and a special rate on home, motor and travel insurance, arranged through CGU.</p> <p>There is also a legal service for members, offering free advice for car crash injuries and discounts on wills and conveyancing. Also, the \"Labour Savings Club\" promises to shop around for you and find savings on big household purchases. Another perk is that you can buy into a wide catalogue of merchandising, along the lines of the Greet the Dawn tea towel, priced at \u00a35.99.</p> <p>But the People's Party credit card - a Co-operative Visa card - doesn't do any favours with a 19.8APR (and a donation to the party of 0.25% of whatever you spend on the card).</p> <p>If this doesn't feel like a party that swings, the Conservatives charge \u00a315 membership for an opposition that can offer a discount wine club and cheap televisions. William Hague might have drawn a few sniggers with his claim to have drunk 14 pints a day as a youth, but it's his party that is rocking enough to offer a reduction on a case of wine from \u00a372.93 to \u00a358.99.</p> <p>If that isn't enough to get you looking right, the party sound system has never been cheaper than through the membership deal with Home Electrical Direct, an online dealer in discount televisions, washing machines, hi-fis and microwaves with a politician-style offer of \"buy now and pay nine months later\".</p> <p>And forget all those snide claims that the Conservatives are Little Englanders afraid of anything with a hint of overseas - because it's the Tories that offer a travel club with trips to Rome and cruises aboard the Ocean Majesty.</p> <p>But a political party needs values, and what better value than the Liberal Democrats, who will let you join their party for a bargain basement \u00a35. Never mind the Tories banging on about save the pound: if you sign up with the Lib Dems you'll have saved a tenner.</p> <p>The party also benefits if you buy books through the online Amazon bookshop, but if you make your purchases using the Liberal Democrat credit card it could be expensive, because the arrangement with the Co-operative Bank is the same as Labour's, which means you'll be paying an illiberal 19.8APR on your purchases - again with a 0.25% of purchases donated to party funds.</p> <p>And don't expect any poundstretcher deals from the Greens, who charge \u00a319 for membership (\u00a38 unwaged). There's also the intriguing offer of life membership for \u00a3247, which if you weren't working would mean you'd have to be a member for 31 years to show a profit. But once you're on the inside with the Greens, you have the pick of party merchandising - polo shirts, sweat shirts, T-shirts (priced \u00a38.50 to \u00a312.75), any colour you like, as long as it's green.</p> <p>The cheekiest political sales pitch must be the Natural Law Party, which promises: \"Donate \u00a3100 or more and receive the book, A Reason to Vote, by Robert Roth completely free as a special thank-you.\" Completely free membership is also available for \u00a315 and a four-hour long \"inspiring\" party video is yours - completely free - for \u00a317. And if you want to make an unmistakable visual statement about yourself, you could sign up with the UK Independence Party and buy a grey polyester tie, priced \u00a39.99, with a \"shadow stripe effect which subtly repeats the words UK Independence Party\".</p> <p>But the real price you have to pay could be much higher. No one likes to admit it, but all political parties have far more than their fair share of misfits and obsessives who find a safe haven in organisations that specialise in dull meetings in community centres and in rooms above pubs around a tray of cement-flavoured sandwiches. So don't expect a bundle of laughs as part of the membership deal.</p> <p>Altogether now, a spontaneous standing ovation on the count of three... </p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Britons are keeping the housebuying habit - for the time being at least. Despite house prices flattening out, an above average 4% plan to move over the next three months, according to the new Move and Improve index from Alliance &amp; Leicester. And that's in line with a similar survey this time last year. </p> <p>Some 6% say they intend to buy between January 2001 and next September. But unless more join them, demand could fall. The index measures sentiment rather than actual decisions. </p> <p>Alliance &amp; Leicester says most people move because they need to - 30% need more space, 16% change because of relationship breakdowns and other personal matters while 13% do so because they have a new job. Only 22% cite \"change of environment\" or \"hating the neighbours.\" </p> <p>But even those who need a new property are not happy with present values. Only 7% of those planning to move reckon now is a good time to invest in bricks and mortar. </p> <p>On one measure, however, house prices look a bargain. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester affordability index - it compares prices with incomes - predicts the average home purchaser will spend 39.5% of take-home pay on their mortgage by the end of this year, compared with 71.3% when the indicator hit an all-time high in 1990. </p> <p>\"The housing market has peaked but the early Bank of England action in raising interest rates has avoided the drastic action needed to regain control a decade ago. We have just had a mini-boom with a much less damaging impact on affordability,\" says C&amp;G 's Roger Burden. </p> <p>And Bradford &amp; Bingley claims buy to rent is still a sound investment with yields of up to 9%. </p>",
  "<p>There is a new watchdog for the insurance industry on the prowl and over the coming months the public will be hearing a lot more about it. </p> <p>The General Insurance Standards Council (GISC), launched two months ago, is an independent body set up to police companies selling insurance including motor, home and travel cover, plus a long list of other products from pet insurance to extended warranties offered by shops selling electrical goods. </p> <p>The GISC has been set up to oversee both the insurance companies themselves and the multitude of firms that sell general insurance, ranging from insurance brokers to supermarkets to car dealerships. Its aim is to make sure people are treated fairly. </p> <p>There is a code of practice containing a list of promises that all companies which sign up must follow, including pledges that all information provided will be \"clear, fair and not misleading\" and that complaints will be handled fairly and promptly. However, the initiative is very much focused on service and behaviour - it does not regulate the price people pay. </p> <p>Since the launch around 500 companies have signed up to the scheme including most of the major insurers (Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, Norwich Union, Direct Line, Cornhill and Churchill are among them) and a number of insurance brokers. Its profile is fairly low at present but over the next few months people will start to see television adverts from insurers that make reference to them being a member of the GISC, and the logo will start to appear in the windows of insurance brokers, travel agents and other high street outlets. </p> <p>At the moment the new watchdog, set up and funded by the industry, is voluntary. However, membership is expected to become compulsory by March next year because (provided the Office of Fair Trading gives the go-ahead) from then, an insurance company that is a GISC member won't be able to deal with a broker, retailer or other seller that isn't regulated by the watchdog. </p> <p>Chris Woodburn, its chief executive, hopes that one day relatively soon, just as most people wouldn't buy a package holiday unless they see the Abta symbol displayed, they won't buy an insurance policy unless they see the GISC logo. </p> <p>In the meantime it is already possible to check whether a particular company has signed up to the scheme. You can log on to the website - <a href=\"http://www.gisc.co.uk\">www.gisc.co.uk</a> - and view the list of members, which is updated all the time. Other well-known insurers which have already signed up include CGNU, Virgin Money and Egg. Mr Woodburn hopes to have 1,000 members by the end of the year, representing 80%-85% of the general insurance business done in this country. </p> <p>One of Mr Woodburn's bugbears is the \"unacceptable pressure\" he believes people are put under to take out extended warranty cover when they buy electrical goods in particular. Britons spend more than \u00a3600m on extended warranty policies each year, an average of \u00a3121 each. These insure your ap pliances for several years after purchase but can cost up to half of the price of the item and often represent poor value for money. It is estimated that only 5% of appliances break down during the warranty years. </p> <p>Aside from home, motor, travel, pet and extended warranty cover, the products covered by the scheme also include private medical and dental insurance, mortgage payment protection insurance and legal expenses cover, but do not include life insurance and pensions. There are one or two other products that could be added to the GISC's remit in the future, including long-term care insurance. </p> <p>The code features a list of pledges including requirements to: </p> <p>\u0095 Explain all the main features of a product including any significant restrictions or exclusions; </p> <p>\u0095 Provide customers with full policy documentation; </p> <p>\u0095 Handle claims \"fairly and promptly\"; </p> <p>\u0095 Give people information about what they should do if they want to make a complaint. </p> <p>The GISC has a dispute resolution facility for handling complaints but doesn't have any powers to force members to compensate customers who suffer problems. However, looking to the future it is expected that members will have to belong to the new financial services ombudsman scheme (a one-stop shop for complaints against a financial services company) being launched within the next year. </p> <p>Leaflets outlining people's rights under the new regime are currently being printed and will be distributed to members. It is also hoped they will be available in Citizens' Advice Bureaux and post offices.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Are you billed as a villain in the X-files?</strong></p> <p>Are you a Mr Smith, Jones or Patel? Are you a citizen of a country other than Britain? Is your father, ex-wife or brother a financial wrongdoer? Did the people who lived in your house before you not pay their bills on time? Answer yes to any of these questions and you might be one of the many people who uncover - often too late - that their credit file is seriously blotted. </p> <p>Last month Jobs &amp; Money highlighted the secretive world of credit scoring - how lenders including banks, department stores and mobile phone companies, score you before deciding to offer you credit. It prompted a large postbag to Jobs &amp; Money, with much of the anger directed at the two credit reference agencies, Experian and Equifax, which dominate the business in the UK. </p> <p>This week Jobs &amp; Money highlights the six major areas where problems repeatedly crop up and how you can challenge the agencies and ensure that your file is corrected. </p> <p>Anyone can apply to the agencies for a copy of their file - it costs \u00a32 - but recent surveys have shown that up to one in 10 files contain errors. The errors may not seem X-rated, but they can lead to an embarrassing credit rejection in a store or, at worst, refusal to give you a mortgage. </p> <p>Your file contains four major types of information. The crucial piece of data is your entry on the electoral roll, as the lack of a ID card system in the UK means the roll is the only way that lenders, especially new telephone and internet-based \"remote\" companies, can identify whether you are who you say you are. </p> <p>Secondly, the file details your repay ment history, warning lenders if you have been in arrears or have defaulted on a credit agreement. Thirdly, it holds the details on any county court judgments recorded against you and, fourthly, it tells lenders about the credit history of related parties, such as your family and other credit applicants at the same address. </p> <p>But it is not Experian or Equifax that accepts or rejects you - it is the lenders which interpret the data and take the decision whether to lend. The good news is that the 1998 Data Protection Act, which comes into force in October next year, will give you more rights to challenge anything held about you - by asking for a \"notice of dispute\" - and will restrict the automatic right of the agencies to use third-party information.</p> <p><strong> American? That won't do nicely</strong><br> </p> <p>You may have lived and worked in Britain for decades, you may even have a wife or husband who is British, but if you don't hold British citizenship you can largely forget about applying for credit. </p> <p>Several angry Americans and Australians wrote to us about how they are constantly refused credit, even though their financial position is perfectly sound. The problem is the electoral roll; non-British citizens are not on the roll, and therefore almost don't exist as far as the credit reference agencies are concerned. Madonna may live in Britain and go out with Guy Ritchie, but she better not apply for a British credit card. </p> <p>Lianne Kordan came to Britain in the 60s from the US with her parents, and is constantly discriminated against. Ashley McEwen married an Englishman and works as a senior PA in the film business in London. </p> <p>Yet her building society rejected her application for a Visa card. She was one of the luckier ones - at least she was told it was because she's not on the electoral roll. </p> <p>\"I pointed out that I was joint-owner of a mortgage and had a long-standing bank account in the UK. Their only attempt at a compromise was to ask me to send two years' worth of bank statements to prove my credit-worthiness. At this point I had had enough and so dropped the enquiry, but the incident still riles me,\" she says. </p> <p>Both Experian and Equifax insist that all a non-British citizen has to do is to provide them with proof of identity, which will be added to the file so that lenders will not automatically refuse credit; if they do refuse on this basis alone, it is breaking industry guidelines. But the experience of Jobs &amp; Money readers is that these guidelines are indeed regularly broken. </p> <p>At Rackhams department store during the January sales the shop assistant convinced Lianne Kordan that she should apply for a storecard to obtain a further 10% discount. But minutes later the assistant returned and gingerly told her: \"I'm afraid Madam, we have a slight problem... \" </p> <p>Being rejected for credit is a problem that Ms Kordan has lived with all her life. Her parents, American academics, came to Britain from the US in the 60s in protest at the Vietnam war. But because she has never given up her US citizenship, she is all but invisible to the credit reference agencies which use the electoral roll to confirm anybody's identity. Her problem is not unique; it affects all non-British citizens who live in the UK. </p> <p>Ms Kordan works in information development for public and higher education authorities, so is no stranger to how databases work. She contacted Experian, which told her to supply evidence of her identity and proof of residency. Experian says: \"The existence of such a statement prevents an automatic credit scoring decision being made and means the statement is seen by anybody searching the file in the future. We also notify anyone who has searched the file within the past six months.\" </p> <p>Ms Kordan says: \"They say this, but it's not what actually happens. You get an operative on the other end of the line who rejects you. They say they do not have the authority to go to that level in my credit file. I tell them they have my permission, but it doesn't make any difference.\" </p> <p>Experian says it is \"mystified\" by Ms Kordan's continued problems. \"This consumer's application would, by law, be referred out of any automatic scoring system and referred for a 'manual' decision. She should be dealt with by someone more senior and should definitely appeal against these decisions.\" </p> <p>However, Ms Kordan draws little comfort from Experian's assurances. \"The problem is that you can't even make it to first base. They're just using a system, the electoral roll, that was never designed to be used as a credit mechanism.\" </p> <p><strong>Alias Smith, Jones and Patel</strong><br> </p> <p>Mr Smith moved into a flat in London five years ago, unaware that another Mr Smith lived in a flat in the same building. Last March he applied for a temporary overdraft from First Direct and was refused, but was recommended to check his file at Experian. Even though he had moved out of the flats 10 months earlier, Experian linked his file to the other Mr Smith, and he suspects this may be why he was refused the overdraft. </p> <p>\"The need for the overdraft has now thankfully passed, but I am pursuing the matter in an effort to find out who is making the decision where. Experian links us to another Smith at our old address although we have requested that they 'disconnect' us. Smithism anyone?\" he says. </p> <p>Experian says that same surnames do cause mix-ups, but plays down how significant the problem is. \"Previous occupants with the same surname do occassionally appear to be concurrent because of the vagaries of updating the electoral roll. It is not fair to say this problem is 'quite common' but it can happen, and, if it does and we are advised that no financial connection exists, we will ensure that the connection is severed,\" says Experian. </p> <p>Equifax admits that if you have lived in a block with other same surname residents, there is a problem. \"If you live in flats with lots of dwellings, it can be a particular problem,\" says an Equifax spokes-man. His advice? \"If you have a common name and have moved recently, get a copy of your file, see who you are associated with, and then ask for a notice of disassociation.\" </p> <p>The problem is, most people won't apply for a file until after they have been rejected. In the US, where the credit reference agencies are even more powerful, consumers can pay $20 a year to have their file sent to them every quarter, so they can easily pick up mistakes. But there are no plans to introduce such a system here. </p> <p><strong>The sins of the fathers</strong><br> </p> <p>Mark Jenkins (not his real name) was turned down for a Halifax mortgage in January this year, prompting him to check the information held on him at Experian and Equifax. He discovered that there was no way for lenders to distinguish between him and his father, who had run into financial difficulties after an industrial accident. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins had the same first name, middle initial and surname as his father, plus they had lived at the same address about six years earlier. The obvious way to differentiate between them is by using date of birth - but, surprisingly, neither Experian or Equifax put this on their systems. </p> <p>\"Dates of birth do not form part of the file, so we would not be able to distinguish between two people with exactly the same name at the same address. We would usually ask the consumer to identify which entries belonged to whom,\" says Experian. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins did so, and said Experian replied promptly. However, although it deleted his association with his father, Experian then listed his address incorrectly, which caused further delays. </p> <p>Equifax refused to drop his father from his file unless he submitted both birth certificates. Mr Jenkins did so. A month later, when a copy of his new Equifax file arrived, he found that the agency had deleted not just his father's details, but nearly all of his as well. \"My credit reference now consisted of my name and address, hardly conducive to inspiring confidence in mortgage lenders,\" he says. \"The whole ridiculous performance has been extremely frustrating, particularly since house prices have leapt over the past year. I still have no idea whether I will be able to get a mortgage. I would appreciate anything that could be done to force the credit agencies to keep more accurate records.\" </p> <p>The agencies say they do their best to keep accurate records, and are forced to do so by Data Protection and Consumer Credit legislation. Mr Jenkins, it appears, may have a strong case for compensation. \"We consider requests for compensation on a case by case basis,\" say the agencies. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins' case highlights how family connections -known as third party data -can cause significant problems, particulary among estranged partners. Experian says parents, children and ex-wifes or ex-husbands are not forever entwined in a credit file. \"We will create disassociations if no financial connections exist. Just ask us.\" </p> <p><strong>Denied credit by a false default</strong><br> </p> <p>One of the more worrying problems encountered by a Jobs &amp; Money reader began after he bought a sofa at Courts Furnishings on a three-month interest free loan. The reader, who wants to remain anonymous, describes himself as a public sector accountant of \"boring financial rectitude\". He only discovered that Courts had incorrectly registered him as defaulting on the loan when he was turned down for a Nationwide Flex Account. </p> <p>\"I discovered that Courts had registered an eight-rating against the loan, even though it had been settled in full. The payment was by direct debit, but the month after it was cleared a further payment was taken. I contacted them and it was put back into my account. Over the next two years I had repeated demands for the money which, of course, I did not owe, including a notification of proceedings. Each time I phoned and was assured the matter was settled and Courts sent letters of apology. It ceased in 1995. But in 1996 there was a posting to Experian with the eight-rating, indicating that the account was only settled after legal action.\" </p> <p>Naturally, he demanded that Experian remove the rating. It refused. \"Their response was that they could only act on the instruction of Courts, which I found astonishing.\" </p> <p>Experian says: \"We would not have 'refused' to remove it. We would have explained that we need first to query the matter with the lender which provided and owned the information. We will and do remove incorrect information. While we do this we mark the data as 'in dispute'. If we fail to satisfy a customer, he or she can complain to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner who will investigate.\" </p> <p>Courts has subsequently apologised and paid the complainant \u00a3500 in compensation, and Nationwide has accepted his application. But his alarming experience is a warning about the dangers of using direct debits, and the need to keep meticulous records - and defaults can be registered against you without you ever knowing. </p> <p><strong>Victims marked as 'fraudsters' </strong><br> </p> <p>Imagine the shock of another Jobs &amp; Money reader (understandably, he also wishes to remain anonymous) when he saw that his credit file accused him of being a fraudster. </p> <p>\"A warning from credit industry fraud busters 'Cifas' warning appeared on my records alleging that when applying for a Capital One credit card saying I had provided a 'genuine name and address' but had included 'material falsehoods and/or omissions in personal details or other relevant information', \" says our reader. </p> <p>Letters to Cifas and Capital One failed to explain what was wrong with my application in the first place. Capital One's initial tactic was to ignore me, it then moved on to say that it could not 'enter into the specifics of my application.'\" </p> <p>Equifax says Cifas alerts on a file do not indicate that they think you are a fraudster. It may be that a credit card has been stolen and used fraudulently, with the lender posting this information on the system. \"It's there to protect lenders and consumers,\" says an Equifax spokesman. </p> <p>He says a Cifas alert should not lead to an automatic rejection. Instead, it produces an automatic referral, where the lender is obliged to speak to the organisation that posted the alert. </p> <p>But the system is far from foolproof. For example, Cifas alerts are attached to addresses rather than individuals, because lenders believe certain addresses are used time and again for making fraudulent applications. </p> <p>Individuals cannot request to have the alert removed. Experian says that if the Cifas alert is incorrect (\"people dealing with fraud prevention tend to be wary of revealing their methodology\"), then the consumer should ask Cifas to investigate and make an amendment if necessary. </p> <p><strong>Where to get help</strong></p> <p>For a copy of your credit reference agency file, write to Experian, Customer Help Service, PO Box 8000, Nottingham NG1 5GX or Equifax, Dept 1E, PO Box 3001, Glasgow G81 2DT.

  "<p>In a matter of months Britain might no longer have a stock exchange to call its own. In a financial world without borders this may be of little consequence. But try telling that to the gaggle of Little Englanders who postured to oust the London Stock Exchange's management this week. </p> <p>The recent history of the exchange is a sorry tale of insularity and inertia. The combination of the most blue chip brand name and the technology revolution presented the opportunity to corner the market in European equity trading. As it is, the exchange now finds itself in a corner, crowded by a hostile bid and an even more hostile shareholder base. </p> <p>Thursday's annual meeting provided a forum for shareholders to air the best part of 20 years worth of accumulated frustrations. The exchange's chief executive, Gavin Casey, was invited to fall on his sword (and yesterday did so). Its recently appointed chairman, Don Cruikshank, was reminded that he is on probation. The curriculum vitae of both were held up to scornful scrutiny. </p> <p><strong> Kept their own counsel</strong><br> </p> <p>Little, if anything, was ever going to be achieved in this forum. The exchange already had a very clear idea of the views of its shareholders and customers - it had called off its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse as a result. The exchange's biggest users - the global investment banks - unsurprisingly kept their own counsel while in public. </p> <p>This is the moment of maximum leverage for Britain's smallest broking houses, particularly those specialising in private client business. </p> <p>A sale of the London exchange, or a merger, requires a 75% voting majority, and votes are distributed much more widely than the concentration of business transacted on the market from day to day. </p> <p>In 1999, British private clients accounted for more than 50% of UK equity bargains transacted on the London exchange. However, in aggregate these represented only 10% of the total value of UK equity business. British institutions, on the other hand, accounted for a third of bargains but two-thirds of total transaction value. </p> <p>Power typically resides with those handling the institutional business. Look at the composition of the committees of users the London exchange relies on for feedback and you will instantly understand the frustrations of smaller brokers. They bear all the worst hallmarks of a gentlemen's club. </p> <p>The LSE would be wrong to lean too far towards its smaller shareholders, however tempting this must be during this time of siege. The Little Englanders offer few solutions to the strategic problem facing all European exchanges: how to harness new technology to fight off the challenge posed by alternative \"virtual\" exchanges. </p> <p>The major investment banks are, in principle, proponents of mergers between stock markets. Even small reductions in transaction costs as a result of merger synergies would have enormous benefits for their bottom line profitability. If only the LSE's plan to merge with Frankfurt had not been so half-baked. Perhaps it was a consequence of relying on the gentlemen's club, Schroders and Merrill Lynch providing the advice. Whatever the reasons, the exchange has jeopardised its support from its biggest customers. </p> <p>Were it under strong management, the exchange would be in a position to drive the consolidation of European stock markets. After all, it is the largest, most liquid, and has the greatest reputation for probity. Under crippled management, though, it has become a (valuable) pawn in a game controlled by other players. </p> <p><strong> Light on cash</strong><br> </p> <p> The one bid on the table for the exchange is from Sweden's OM Gruppen, which already operates 10 markets around the world and provides the technology for many others. OM has been welcomed for busting apart the London-Frankfurt merger but is given little chance of ultimate success. </p> <p>It would be foolish, however, to dismiss OM's chances out of hand. Its bid is admittedly light on cash and heavy on OM shares, whose valuation appears unsustainably high. But few hostile takeovers are ever settled on the first bid. </p> <p>Earlier this week I had the opportunity to hear OM's case first hand. Its management presented an argument clearly tailored to allay the fears of the rank and file of Britain's broking community: commercial management of a technology-rich, London-centric European exchange. In essence, an alliance of London's brand and OM's expertise. </p> <p>It was difficult to fault OM's logic, but for me something was missing - a sense of grandeur befitting London's history. This may sound pompous. It may sound very 19th century. But it reflects the scale of opportunity now available to those who dare to dream. </p> <p>For OM to succeed it needs to convince the global investment banks - not be cause they control the London exchange's share register but because their financial muscle behind a revised OM bid could \"buy\" the approval of the smaller brokers. </p> <p>To corral the global players, OM must, of course, convince that it has the management and the expertise to execute its plans. </p> <p>But, over and above that, it must demonstrate that a takeover of the LSE is but the first step towards a much, much bigger network of exchanges. </p> <p>There is unlikely to be room in Europe for more than two big networks. London dare not be left out in the cold but then neither can Frankfurt, Paris, Milan - or indeed Stockholm in the shape of OM Gruppen itself. No player can be underestimated, for each lives in fear of the abyss beneath its feet. Most of the Europeans will concede national control in order to secure a seat at the table. </p> <p><strong> Artificial division</strong><br> </p> <p> It is no surprise, however, that nationalistic issues loom large in Britain, Germany and France. The iX proposal was a political compromise reflecting these sensitivities - an artificial division of labour between London and Frankfurt with no room for the French. </p> <p>London's reputation as a financial centre is such that it should sell itself dearly. But it should also trust its ability to win through regardless of the LSE's ultimate fate. </p> <p>Those left out in the cold will be those with least to offer or those blinded by their own parochialism. London is not the former, but risks becoming the latter. </p> <p>For the London exchange's current management it is probably too late. But they could attempt a small first step on the long road to rehabilitation by initiating an open-minded dialogue with all possible partners, OM included. </p> <p>Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities </p> <p><a href=\"mailtoedmondw@omsecurities.co.uk\">edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk </a></p>",
  "<p>After a bright start, Celtic made heavy weather of beating a Finnish team who from the outset had looked inferior but were soon allowed to appear quite accomplished. On a night when a minor throng of 40,000 should have been allowed to bay with delight, they ended up growling with disdain. </p> <p>It was another occasion when Eyal Berkovic had a mere walk-on role for Celtic, the Israeli getting 15 minutes as a substitute for Lubomir Moravcik, once more fuelling rumours that he will shortly leave the club. </p> <p>Celtic's start under Martin O'Neill this season has resem bled no other in living memory, though the new manager still faces a tall order, and it is 20 years since Celtic last survived in Europe beyond Christmas. </p> <p>At present there is no lovelier sight at Parkhead than the hair-band, a remark no one would have got away with in the hard days under Jock Stein. </p> <p>The piece of equipment used by Henrik Larsson to control his flying locks had never been a Glasgow favourite before, but big men today who follow Celtic are almost tempted to wear it in the street, so symbolic is it of goals. </p> <p>Larsson, his foliage firmly strapped down, hit two first-half goals, and kept poking away at the Finns with menace. Larsson's first, a sweet header from Jackie McNamara's cross after 14 minutes, left the Helsinki goalkeeper Jani Viander without hope. The Swede's second 10 minutes later was an adept chip over Viander following Chris Sutton's clever pass. </p> <p>Having started so well, Celtic allowed complacency to set in, and the Finns found spaces in which to express their wiles. They were not devoid of tricks. </p> <p>Rafael, their trumpeted Brazilian, had already caused Jonathan Gould to parry a shot, and only McNamara's blunt challenge on Janne Saarinen prevented Helsinki from snatching a goal. </p> <p>Celtic, indeed, became rather flustered in the second half. None of it did O'Neill's calm demeanour any good. </p> <p>\u0095 Hearts rode their luck in Stuttgart at times but produced a gritty defensive display and the Germans - fresh from beating Bayern Munich at the weekend - could manage only a 1-0 first-leg win. Stuttgart's 35th-minute goal came via a clever floated free-kick by their Bulgarian international Krassimir Balakov. </p> <p> <strong> Celtic</strong> (3-5-2): Gould; Mjallby, Boyd, Valgaeren; McNamara, Lambert, Moravcik (Berkovic, 75min), Petrov, Mahe (Healy, 51); Sutton, Larsson. </p> <p><strong> HJK Helsinki: </strong> (3-5-2): Viander; Turpeinen, Kuivasto, Heikkinen; Yeremenko, Hakanpaa, Nylund, Yla-Jussila (Paulus, 60), Saarinen; Kaliio, Rafael. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> D Drabek (Austria).</p>",

  "<p><strong> Warwickshire 400-8 dec Essex 208-5</strong><br> </p> <p> Mark Wagh's bowling action will be put under the microscope by the England and Wales Cricket Board after he was \"warned off\" by the umpires John Hampshire and Barry Dudleston. </p> <p>After completing one over of off-spin costing four runs, Wagh was withdrawn from the attack after the umpires conferred and called the captain Neil Smith into the discussion. The umpires expressed doubts about the legality of Wagh's action and Smith voluntarily took him off. Lord's was contacted during the tea interval and it is now up to the ECB to make a judgment. </p> <p>Wagh was no doubt left reflecting how much fortunes can change in 24 hours. A day earlier he had scored a career-best 137 which culminated in the award of his county cap. </p> <p>Yesterday, in this promotion battle, it was the turn of Darren Robinson to impose himself with the bat. With some justification it can be truly said that he has had an \"in and out\" career since making his Essex debut eight seasons ago. </p> <p>It was believed that the retirement in 1997 of Graham Gooch, in whose shadow he tried to make progress in the early years, would see him grasp the opportunity to make more use of his talent. But centuries have been rare and yesterday he was denied one when he turned Smith's off-spin into the hands of backward short-leg. </p> <p>Nevertheless he can console himself that his 92 was full of character and value. He arrived after Paul Prichard, half forward, was removed lbw by Charles Dagnall without a run on the board, and then watched Paul Grayson and Stuart Law fall cheaply, the latter to a magnificent one-handed catch by Trevor Penney at cover. </p> <p>That left Essex in some disarray at 63 for three and Warwickshire's 400 for eight declared must have seemed on the distant horizon. Robinson, however, was to restore sanity to the Essex innings against an attack lacking Allan Donald, Ed Giddins and Ashley Giles. </p> <p>The skipper Ronnie Irani was the other major contributor. He passed 50 for the ninth time this season in a championship match and is due to resume this morning on 72 when Essex's immediate aim will be to gather the additional 43 runs required to avoid being asked to follow on.</p>",
  "Charles Kennedy will tell next week's Liberal Democrat conference that the current upsurge of popular protest gives them the chance to become \"the anti-politics party\" because they share the voters' anger and disappointment. <p>Facing his second party conference as Paddy Ashdown's successor, Mr Kennedy will urge activists to be bolder in \"tapping into anti-politics political sentiment, and make our number with an awful lot of people\". </p> <p>They could do so because their policy message chimes with the wider mood of public protest, he said: the need for better-funded public services and more openness about taxation; and the need to create a more direct link between how taxes are raised and what they are spent on - including roads, schools and hospitals.</p> <p>In a pre-conference interview with the Guardian as the petrol crisis eased yesterday, the Lib Dem leader was careful not to align himself with rightwing populist campaigns on issues as different as asylum and immigration, law and order, petrol prices and child abusers. </p> <p>\"I am not saying we should become champions of direct action, of course not; because I lead a parliamentary party and believe in something called parliamentary democracy. But parliamentary democracy must be more responsive to sentiment in the country, though not populist sentiment. </p> <p>\"We did not buy the populist line in the Martin case [the farmer who killed a burglar], on asylum and immigration, or a number of other issues,\" insisted Mr Kennedy.\"You have to stick to your core principles, but say you want better engagement with the public than any of us are yet managing.\" </p> <p>He cited his outspoken but unpopular support for Europe - he now wants sterling to join the euro in September 2004 after a 25% devaluation - and hs call for for higher public spending that Tony Blair repeatedly condemned before he did a u-turn on the NHS. </p> <p>The uproar at last year's world trade conference in Seattle was at least as significant a protest, he believed, and (like the fuel pickets) was also a product of informal organisations using new technologies (the internet and mobile phones) that meant such \"social revolutions\" could emerge very rapidly. </p> <p>\"It shows how the power structure is potentially moving away from the established world of politics much more in the direction of the grassroot, people's world of politics - which has a very different vocabulary,\" he explained. </p> <p>Watching TV phone-ins, he had been startled by the vehemence of the hostility directed at Mr Blair and his colleagues for allegedly being out of touch: \"It is extraordinary for an administration that prides itself on being the apotheosis of that sort of thing.\" </p> <p>It all showed how people with a heartfelt cause could get a long way with public opinion and media access, Mr Kennedy argued, though he rejected Tory claims that this week's dispute had been a taxpayer's revolt. What the situation needed was a government willing to explain the link between taxes and spending. </p> <p>\"It's a classic case of 'if this is where we take money from, then this is what we are going to spend it on',\" he said. Coincidentally the earmarking of specific taxes for specific purposes, the technical term is hypothecation, is a theme of his new book, The Future of Politics (HarperCollins \u00a317.99). </p> <p>Environmental taxes that helped build better public transport were a crucial ingredient, though the Highland-born MP (first elected for the old SDP at the age of 23) was enough of a country dweller to realise that many rural voters needed cars. </p> <p>Aides were yesterday instructed to raise the profile of next week's scheduled environment debate in Bournemouth. In his book, Mr Kennedy is frank enough to admit that not taking green issues seriously enough when he was first elected in 1983 is one of his four big mistakes. </p> <p>The others are his failure to protest enough when London police quashed demonstrations against the Chinese premier Jiang Zemin in 1999, his failure to vote against the disastrous child support agency, and his advice to Mr Ashdown that the Lib Dems should not publicise their controversial policy decision to call for a royal commission into the possible decriminalisation of drugs. </p> <p>The book is organised around the MP for Ross, Skye and Inverness West's core belief in liberty, with each chapter bearing titles like Freedom from Poverty or Freedom to Breathe: the Green Future. But it concludes on the need to restore idealism to the political system. </p> <p>\"It will not be possible to categorise the voter of 2020 as a socialist or a conservative. He or she a variety of things; internationalist, green, committed to properly-funded public services, and technologically aware.\" </p> <p>Green issues and IT were crucial to engaging the young in politics, he believed. Though admitting he was no Ashdown with computers, he did use a laptop and a Psion personal organiser. \"To people now going through school and university, it is all like riding a bike was to my generation, that's the difference. I don't know how electricity works, but I couldn't imagine existence without it. That's how they feel about IT.\" </p> <p>Mr Kennedy, 40, is thinner than he was a year ago; there is a Diet Coke can on his desk. Sitting in Paddy Ashdown's office, where he has changed all the paintings (there is one of the Palace of Westminster burning down in 1837), he shrugged off criticisms that he is less active than \"Action Man\" or that he had less influence with Mr Blair - whom he saw for a chat last week. </p> <p>His book contains not a single reference to the word \"project\" - shorthand for Lib-Lab cooperation beloved of Messrs Blair and Ashdown. \"The second half of any parliament is more competitive than the first half, instinctively so.\" And there was not much progress to be made on the shared Lib-Lab agenda for constitutional reform this side of polling day. </p> <p>\"I think there's a clear, settled mood in the Liberal Democrats. The atmosphere in the party is relaxed, the party is relaxed with me and I am relaxed with the party. They know we are carrying on with the joint consultative committee [with Labour] in perfectly responsible constructive cooperation. But they also know there is no question of fighting the next election other than as an independent political party.\" </p> <p>Could he one day serve in a Lib-Lab coalition as Ashdown might have done? He did not rule it out. \"I think it will be arithmetic-driven,\" dependent on the next election result. But he did not think it likely \"because the first-past-the-post [voting] system usually delivers a clearcut majority. That is what it is designed to do.\" </p> <p>Did it annoy him that Mr Blair had kicked into touch the two promised referendums Mr Kennedy and his party activists so badly wanted, on the euro and on electoral reform for Westminster? It must have done, but the genial Mr Kennedy did not admit it. \"It's better for me to concentrate on what is attainable at this stage rather than what is unattainable.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>RANIERI TAKES THE REINS? </strong></p> <p>The long-running managerial saga at swanky boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea- it's only been three days since Luca got sacked but it's felt like three years in solitary confinement - looks like coming to an end. Claudio Ranieri has apparently signed a two-year deal with the club and will be unveiled as manager sometime before the Blues play Leicester on Sunday.</p> <p>Can this really be true? Well, let's look at the evidence. Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson confirmed that talks with Ranieri were held yesterday and today. William Hill suspended betting after \"a number of well-informed punters came in for substantial bets\". Onefootball.com mentioned a \"source close to Ranieri\" who claimed the 48-year-old has \"accepted the offer of a short-term deal\". And Ranieri himself told Gazzetta della Sport that he was \"flattered by the call from Chelsea. If there are roses, they will bloom.\"</p> <p>Of course, even a seemingly done deal can fall through. But all of this suggests the Italian will very soon be taking hold of Ken Bates's beard and riding him like a sorry taking hold of the managerial reins at Stamford Bridge. The Fiver reckons Chelsea could do worse: Ranieri took Cagliari to Serie A with two successive promotions, won the Italian Cup and Super Cup with Fiorentina, and sowed the Big Cup seeds reaped by Hector Cuper at Valencia, where he also won the Spanish Cup. Now that's the sort of trophy haul which would satisfy El Presidente. Isn't it?</p> <p><strong>BULLY BOY</strong></p> <p>At the start of the season, David O'Leary O'Leeds assured us that Alan Smith had changed. He wasn't the nasty young thug of a year or two ago. No sirree! And the sincerity in his words, coupled with young Smith's new found tendency to find the back of the net rather than the back of his opponents' Achilles, had us believing that the boy really had turned over a new leaf. So imagine our shock this morning when we found out that young Smith has been trying to cripple half the Barcelona team.</p> <p>First Frank De Boer accused him of being \"mean and nasty\" and then, without any hint of a Scouse accent, warned him that \"if he is going to become a top player he must calm down\". By mid-afternoon, Phillip Cocu had joined in, accusing Smith of injuring him with a two-footed challenge: \"It looks like I'll be out of action for ten days to two weeks following a tackle - one of many - by Alan Smith.

It's a mouth-watering prospect, we're sure you'll agree. It is also highly unlikely to happen, unless the government changes the law to include the phrase: \"If there is no proof but the Fiver swears that it is true, then it is\". But while we in England are unlikely to experience our national coach undergoing a courtroom humiliation, the Germans, lucky people, are getting precisely that.</p> <p>According to reports emanating from central Europe, Germany coach-in-waiting Christoph Daum is being taken to court by his old pal and former business partner Heinz Kress, inventor of that little green weed that grows in carpet if it's watered properly. Kress is currently on trial for fraud after a glamorous Majorcan holiday resort went belly up, and he claims that Daum has run off with \u00a394,000 (or 2.1111111101010101 Euros) of his money.</p> <p>The Bayer Leverkusen boss is not entirely in agreement with Kress about this. He claims: \"I always behaved correctly, to this level I do not go. The statements are an absurdity.\" Indeed, there could be an entirely different explanation for the trouble. Kress and Daum have something else in common: Angelica Camm, Kress's ex-wife, left him for Daum back in 1998. Fantastic. Why can't anything this exciting happen to Koog?

  "<p>Timothy Everest is on a personal mission to rekindle Britain's reputation as the foremost influence on, and producer of, menswear in the world. But this is no Mission: Impossible (Everest dressed Tom Cruise in both recent films). Timothy Everest is part of the new generation of bespoke tailors (Richard James and Oswald Boateng being the other notable contenders) who are shaking off tailoring's stuffy image while retaining its impeccable quality and attention to detail. </p> <p>He celebrates his tenth anniversary this month and his client list reads like a Who's Who of the world's rich and famous. But now his talents are available to many more punters than his 3,500 bespoke customers. Everest has been drafted in by Marks &amp; Spencer to inject life into the store's menswear by producing an exclusive collection for their Autograph range, due to hit the stores on October 12. It will be in addition to his Sartorial suiting line, produced for M&amp;S for several seasons. </p> <p>But Autograph is not just a nip and tuck administered to Marks' menswear. The store hopes this is the start of a turnaround in the way their menswear is perceived. It will be sold in a dedicated in-store area of its own and will serve as the masthead for a complete revision of menswear for the UK's largest clothing retailer. </p> <p>Everest is quietly confident about Autograph. \"The first collection is a good start. When I arrived at Marks &amp; Spencer, I thought it would be an easier task because they're a British institution and my style is very British. But I soon realised this British institution didn't have many British offerings. They were selling top quality Italian-style suits in great fabrics for a third of what you'd pay for a designer suit, but there was no British menswear as I think of it. Maybe there's an existing client base who aren't being served and maybe we can bring in a younger customer, too. I've tried to build a collection for someone who wants great separates - a check pant or roll-neck - as well as suits which I covered with the Sartorial line.\" </p> <p>Pitching to M&amp;S, Everest sought to convince them where the real strengths in British menswear lay. \"In producing a collection about modern Britain, I looked back to photos of people like David Bailey and Mick Jagger. I discovered British menswear was more rugged than we remembered. It was more kitchen-sink drama than Austin Powers and I've tried to marry that ruggedness with a Jermyn Street eccentricity. The quality, the fit and the detailing are very good, and it's made in Britain.\" </p> <p>Everest is moving in two directions at once: mass market with M&amp;S, upmarket with bespoke. \"Not everyone can afford, is interested in or has the time for bespoke and I want to make the business even more secretive. I like being off the beaten track [in London's now fashionable but formerly run-down Spitalfields]. OK, someone might buy an Autograph suit and work up, but they're really separate. I don't want to be pigeonholed in this hip new-bespoke movement or become a designer fashion brand.\" </p> <p>But what future has the suit in a Britain populated by tracksuited dads and trendy-denimed youth? Most men don't even wear a suit to work any more. \"I attended a dinner recently at which Derek Hatton spoke and he told a story about his mate who runs a dress hire shop for funerals. I thought: 'Oh no, here comes the scouser gag' but it wasn't. He said it was doing really well because kids attending funerals were buying a boring black suit and black tie and liking it. Because their dads dress casual, don't know how to tie a tie and perhaps have never worn a suit, they think they're being cool and cutting edge. So they're buying suits. For them, tailoring is not old-fashioned, it's something completely new.\" </p> <p>In addition to the core bespoke business, Everest has launched a ready-to-wear menswear line and will introduce womenswear next spring. He's dressed Tom Cruise, Robin Williams and Burt Bacharach for the Oscars and designed formalwear and parade costumes for the British Olympic team. Busy boy, but that's not all: for four months, he has also been working on the renaissance of another British institution, DAKS Simpson, in his role as creative director. The first stage in its rebirth as cutting edge brand is the opening of a store on London's Bond Street this autumn and an ad campaign which, Everest says, is to \"signal we're doing something new without frightening people\". His first solo collection will not go in-store until autumn 2001. </p> <p>This kind of make-over is known in the trade as \"doing a Burberry\" (which in turn \"did a Gucci\"). \"What frustrates me is that designers like Ralph Lauren thrive on a past that never existed. Why aren't we doing that ourselves? There's lots of synergy between my business and DAKS as it's already a British institution and I am trying to build one. It took Burberry three years to get it right: I want to get DAKS right in two.\" </p> <p>The problem for DAKS and M&amp;S will be to draw younger men away from the lure of the Diesels, Armanis and Hilfigers of this world, with their colossal marketing budgets. Does Everest believe kids reared on branded casualwear will mature into stylish Autograph or DAKS wearers? \"I was the ultimate fashion victim when I was young, but today to be fashionable is old-fashioned because anyone can buy any look they want. You just have to pick up a magazine and it tells you what to wear. To be individual is the only way to be new.\" </p> <p>So there you have it. Timothy Everest, potential saviour of British menswear, believes fashionable is old-fashioned. Or, put another way, suits are the new jeans.</p>",
  "<p>The American senate has approved $28.7 billion in spending for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The legislation also sets a cap on development costs for the International Space Station. </p> <p>The legislation, which passed 399-17, also moves to renegotiate the space station agreement so that participants' benefits are more in line with their actual contributions and so America shares less of the future operating costs. </p> <p>Rep. James Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Science Committee, said the bill would improve management of the project, \"which will serve as the backbone of our human spaceflight program for the next two decades.\" </p> <p>He said financial support for the space agency would allow it to \"continue developing our knowledge in areas ranging from the growth of cancer cells to the El Nino weather effect on earth and the nature of black holes deep within our universe.\" </p> <p>The bill, a compromise worked out by House and Senate negotiators, now goes back to the Senate for a final vote. It authorises $14.1 billion for the space agency in fiscal year 2001 and $14.6 billion in 2002, both figures slightly above what the administration requested. </p> <p>That includes about $4 billion over the two years for the space station, equal to the president's request, and $6.5 billion for the space shuttle. </p> <p>The legislation caps spending on space station development at $25 billion and limits space shuttle launch costs in connection with the 16-nation project at $17.7 billion. </p> <p>But to meet administration objections that this would limit Nasa's ability to deal with unforeseen problems, lawmakers also agreed to set up a $5 billion contingency fund for the space station and $3.5 billion for the shuttle, to meet emergencies. </p> <p>Congress acted as American and Russian crewmen from the space shuttle Atlantis worked to install equipment on the space station in preparation for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in November. Nasa plans eight shuttle trips to the station in the next year. </p> <p>In 1993 Nasa estimated that the space station would cost $17.4 billion to build, but now puts development costs in the $24-26 billion range, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Cost overruns are in part a result of Russian delays in meeting its obligations in the project, particularly in launching a service module.</p>",

  "Charles Kennedy will tell next week's Liberal Democrat conference that the current upsurge of popular protest gives them the chance to become \"the anti-politics party\" because they share the voters' anger and disappointment. <p>Facing his second party conference as Paddy Ashdown's successor, Mr Kennedy will urge activists to be bolder in \"tapping into anti-politics political sentiment, and make our number with an awful lot of people\". </p> <p>They could do so because their policy message chimes with the wider mood of public protest, he said: the need for better-funded public services and more openness about taxation; and the need to create a more direct link between how taxes are raised and what they are spent on - including roads, schools and hospitals. </p> <p>In a pre-conference interview with the Guardian as the petrol crisis eased yesterday, the Lib Dem leader was careful not to align himself with rightwing populist campaigns on issues as different as asylum and immigration, law and order, petrol prices and child abusers. </p> <p>\"I am not saying we should become champions of direct action, of course not; because I lead a parliamentary party and believe in something called parliamentary democracy. But parliamentary democracy must be more responsive to sentiment in the country, though not populist sentiment. </p> <p>\"We did not buy the populist line in the Martin case [the farmer who killed a burglar], on asylum and immigration, or a number of other issues,\" insisted Mr Kennedy.\"You have to stick to your core principles, but say you want better engagement with the public than any of us are yet managing.\" </p> <p>He cited his outspoken but unpopular support for Europe - he now wants sterling to join the euro in September 2004 after a 25% devaluation - and hs call for for higher public spending that Tony Blair repeatedly condemned before he did a u-turn on the NHS. </p> <p>The uproar at last year's world trade conference in Seattle was at least as significant a protest, he believed, and (like the fuel pickets) was also a product of informal organisations using new technologies (the internet and mobile phones) that meant such \"social revolutions\" could emerge very rapidly. </p> <p>\"It shows how the power structure is potentially moving away from the established world of politics much more in the direction of the grassroot, people's world of politics - which has a very different vocabulary,\" he explained. </p> <p>Watching TV phone-ins, he had been startled by the vehemence of the hostility directed at Mr Blair and his colleagues for allegedly being out of touch: \"It is extraordinary for an administration that prides itself on being the apotheosis of that sort of thing.\" </p> <p>It all showed how people with a heartfelt cause could get a long way with public opinion and media access, Mr Kennedy argued, though he rejected Tory claims that this week's dispute had been a taxpayer's revolt. What the situation needed was a government willing to explain the link between taxes and spending. </p> <p>\"It's a classic case of 'if this is where we take money from, then this is what we are going to spend it on',\" he said. Coincidentally the earmarking of specific taxes for specific purposes, the technical term is hypothecation, is a theme of his new book, The Future of Politics (HarperCollins \u00a317.99). </p> <p>Environmental taxes that helped build better public transport were a crucial ingredient, though the Highland-born MP (first elected for the old SDP at the age of 23) was enough of a country dweller to realise that many rural voters needed cars. </p> <p>Aides were yesterday instructed to raise the profile of next week's scheduled environment debate in Bournemouth. In his book, Mr Kennedy is frank enough to admit that not taking green issues seriously enough when he was first elected in 1983 is one of his four big mistakes. </p> <p>The others are his failure to protest enough when London police quashed demonstrations against the Chinese premier Jiang Zemin in 1999, his failure to vote against the disastrous child support agency, and his advice to Mr Ashdown that the Lib Dems should not publicise their controversial policy decision to call for a royal commission into the possible decriminalisation of drugs. </p> <p>The book is organised around the MP for Ross, Skye and Inverness West's core belief in liberty, with each chapter bearing titles like Freedom from Poverty or Freedom to Breathe: the Green Future. But it concludes on the need to restore idealism to the political system. </p> <p>\"It will not be possible to categorise the voter of 2020 as a socialist or a conservative. He or she a variety of things; internationalist, green, committed to properly-funded public services, and technologically aware.\" </p> <p>Green issues and IT were crucial to engaging the young in politics, he believed. Though admitting he was no Ashdown with computers, he did use a laptop and a Psion personal organiser. \"To people now going through school and university, it is all like riding a bike was to my generation, that's the difference. I don't know how electricity works, but I couldn't imagine existence without it. That's how they feel about IT.\" </p> <p>Mr Kennedy, 40, is thinner than he was a year ago; there is a Diet Coke can on his desk. Sitting in Paddy Ashdown's office, where he has changed all the paintings (there is one of the Palace of Westminster burning down in 1837), he shrugged off criticisms that he is less active than \"Action Man\" or that he had less influence with Mr Blair - whom he saw for a chat last week. </p> <p>His book contains not a single reference to the word \"project\" - shorthand for Lib-Lab cooperation beloved of Messrs Blair and Ashdown. \"The second half of any parliament is more competitive than the first half, instinctively so.\" And there was not much progress to be made on the shared Lib-Lab agenda for constitutional reform this side of polling day. </p> <p>\"I think there's a clear, settled mood in the Liberal Democrats. The atmosphere in the party is relaxed, the party is relaxed with me and I am relaxed with the party. They know we are carrying on with the joint consultative committee [with Labour] in perfectly responsible constructive cooperation. But they also know there is no question of fighting the next election other than as an independent political party.\" </p> <p>Could he one day serve in a Lib-Lab coalition as Ashdown might have done? He did not rule it out. \"I think it will be arithmetic-driven,\" dependent on the next election result. But he did not think it likely \"because the first-past-the-post [voting] system usually delivers a clearcut majority. That is what it is designed to do.\" </p> <p>Did it annoy him that Mr Blair had kicked into touch the two promised referendums Mr Kennedy and his party activists so badly wanted, on the euro and on electoral reform for Westminster? It must have done, but the genial Mr Kennedy did not admit it. \"It's better for me to concentrate on what is attainable at this stage rather than what is unattainable.\"</p>",
  "<p>The crew of space shuttle Atlantis were tackling a host of mechanical and electric tasks early Friday aboard the international space station, including installing an oxygen generator and troubleshooting a recalcitrant battery. </p> <p>The seven-man crew is outfitting and upgrading the orbiting complex for the November arrival of its first permanent residents. </p> <p>Two important tasks faced astronaut Edward Lu and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, who have been the main equipment installers on this mission. Among the items they've rigged up already are a toilet, three batteries, power cables, and an external compass and boom. </p> <p>First thing Friday, the pair installed four power converters aboard the Russian service module Zvezda. The converters will eventually distribute electricity to the two Russian station segments from a pair of US-built solar wings, which are to be attached in December. </p> <p>Next, they were to put in place a different type of converter, a Russian device called Elektron, which separates water into hydrogen and breathable oxygen as part of the station's life support systems. </p> <p>Meanwhile, astronaut Daniel Burbank dropped under Zvezda's floorboards to investigate problems with a new Russian-made battery that has refused to charge correctly. The only glitch so far on the smooth-running mission, the balky battery was one of three new ones installed Wednesday aboard Zvezda. Two others were installed in the other Russian module, Zarya. </p> <p>For a preliminary diagnosis, Burbank checked the battery's connections, which he reported were clean and tight. Mission Control debated asking Burbank to pull out another battery to gain access to a controller for the failing battery, but opted to schedule that job for later Friday. </p> <p>Nasa and their Russian counterparts were no closer to finding out what ails the battery. \"I think it's a little too early to understand exactly where we're going on this. Hopefully, our troubleshooting tomorrow will get us a little bit farther down that path,\" lead space station flight director Mark Ferring said. </p> <p>If this crew can't solve the mystery, Nasa isn't too worried: Zvezda can run on as few as five of its eight batteries with a crew aboard. Seven of them are working now. </p> <p>By Friday, the astronauts had unloaded more than half of some 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms) of gear from Atlantis and a Russian Progress supply ship docked to Zvezda. </p> <p>The Progress was completely emptied, freeing it to be filled with discarded packaging and other unneeded items. The trash-laden ship will turn into a garbage incinerator when it burns up upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere later this year. </p> <p>Also Friday, commander Terrence Wilcutt and pilot Scott Altman fired Atlantis' rockets to gently nudge the station about four miles higher, raising its orbit to about 237 miles.</p>",
  "Parents will not be allowed access to the sex offenders register, home secretary Jack Straw says. <p>Mr Straw says controlling public access to the register would be impossible and would not help protect children. The Home Secretary added: \"Such an arrangement would not in our judgment assist the protection of children or public safety.\" After their meeting with Mr Straw, the Paynes, from Hersham, Surrey, said they had found common ground in some areas, such as tougher sentences, and had disagreed on others. </p> <p>The Paynes, both 31, handed a 700,000-strong petition backing Sarah's Law to the Home Secretary. Mr Payne said the massive public support for their campaign and the thousands of letters they had received since Sarah was snatched on July 1 after a day on the beach in West Sussex had helped them cope with her death. </p> <p>The petition included more than 700,000 signatures from News of the World readers, gathered since the newspaper started its Sarah's Law campaign. </p> <p>Mr Straw's decision comes despite the campaign spearheaded by the parents of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne, who met the Home Secretary earlier this week. </p> <p>Sara and Michael Payne are pressing for the introduction of a 'Sarah's Law' which would give parents access to the register. </p> <p>However, a package of measures to strengthen the protection of children and provide more information to the public was announced by Mr Straw. </p> <p>The proposals include a new statutory duty on the police and probation services to establish arrangements for assessing and managing the risks posed by all sex offenders and other dangerous offenders released into the community. </p> <p>The home secretary would also be given power to issue guidance on these arrangements to the public. A statutory duty will be placed on the probation service to ask victims or their families if they want to be consulted on the release arrangements for sex and violence offenders sentenced to 12 months or more. </p> <p>Victims or their families could be kept informed of the offender's release arrangements and details of any licence conditions restricting his or her movements. </p> <p>The package also includes proposals to tighten up the operation of the Sex Offenders Register and for a new Sex Offender Restraining Order. </p> <p>Mr Straw said the tragedy of Sarah Payne's death had touched everyone's lives. \"We have, I believe, recognised the very strong public concern which her murder has evoked,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The intention of these measures is to provide stronger safeguards for children and also to reassure the public about risk management of sex offenders in the community through the provision of more information about these arrangements.\" </p> <p>Mr Straw said members of the public will not be given access to the names and addresses of people on the Sex Offenders Register. </p> <p>He explained: \"Controlled disclosure is I believe the better and safer route. Therefore I have concluded that the professional agencies, the police and probation services, are best-placed to determine the disclosure of information on individual sex offenders. </p> <p>\"But I do believe that the public should have a right to know what measures the police and probation services have in place to protect the public.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two senior executives of Trinity Mirror - including Roger Eastoe, who was in charge of the group's national newspaper titles - are leaving as part of a reshuffle engineered by chief executive Philip Graf. </p> <p>The restructuring has created a new senior post overseeing the group's national and regional titles. </p> <p>The company said the new executive would free Mr Graf to supervise the development of Trinity Mirror's new media business, and to look for further acquisitions. </p> <p>The job has been offered to an as yet unnamed executive with a background in consumer product marketing, Mr Graf said. Mr Eastoe, 49, was a Mirror Group stalwart. He is due to leave at the end of the month, and a group statement said he was pursuing \"a number of business opportunities\". </p> <p>He denied there had been any acrimony: \"I've been at the crease for 25 years and run the nationals for four or five years, and I've had a great time. I was here at the low point for the Mirror Group when we weren't sure there was a business anymore. I am moving on now, but the business is in good shape.\" </p> <p>Mike Masters, the other executive on his way out, was group managing director publishing and will retire at the end of the year. </p> <p>Mr Graf said Trinity Mirror's immediate focus would be to pursue further acquisitions in the regional press, although he conceded the group was reluctant to engage in a bidding war for Regional Independent Media. The group has, however, sought permission from the DTI to acquire certain RIM titles in Lancashire should they become available. </p> <p>Much of his focus will be on the internet business - including the evaluation of the group's role as an internet service provider. </p> <p>Trinity Mirror reported a 14.7% increase in half-year, pre-tax profits to \u00a3104.5m before a \u00a315m cost of investing in new activities. Revenues were 7.4% higher at \u00a3560m, and shares climbed 15.5p to 540p. </p> <p>The Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People achieved 7.4% revenue growth to \u00a3210m and operating profit of \u00a343m for the first half. Regionals grew revenues 6.1% to \u00a3245.3m and profits by 10% to \u00a366.8m.</p>",
  "<p>Leading pro-Europeans yesterday launched a withering attack on Eurosceptic \"myths\" and scare stories about supposed EU plans to ban curved bananas, cheddar cheese and mushy peas. </p> <p>The former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke and the union leader Sir Ken Jackson criticised anti-euro groups for \"twisting the facts\" about Brussels as Britain in Europe published a pamphlet challenging recent reports about law-making in the European Union. </p> <p>The pamphlet, Straight Bananas? - 150 anti-European myths exploded, is part of a drive to debunk anti-European myths, which the all-party pro-euro group claimed were to blame for the low level of support which exists in the UK for joining the single currency. </p> <p>The stories exposed as false in the pamphlet include supposed plans by European commissioners to ban the traditional British loaf, overly curved cucumbers, shandy and soya milk, and to rename brandy butter as \"brandy spreadable fat\". </p> <p>Mr Clarke, a patron of Britain in Europe, said: \"We are all tired of the way some of the anti-European campaigns have twisted the facts about our place in Europe.\" </p> <p>He added: \"This pamphlet is one answer to millions of pounds worth of misleading propaganda.\" </p> <p>At the TUC conference in Glasgow, Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the AEEU, said: \"The No camp is built on myths and misconceptions. The polls show people want the hard facts.\" </p> <p>Andrew Haldenby of Business for Sterling, a leading group in the No campaign, dismissed the pamphlet as \"pathetic\".</p>",

  "I doubt if I'm the only person who has discovered a fascinating new form of reading during the petrol crisis - a winking patch of liquid crystal display on the car dashboard which I've previously found too confusing to use. <p>It's part of something called the \"Driver Information System\" which always goes wrong, particularly when my children press its two control buttons too keenly, and it starts unfathomable tasks like assessing your maximum speed and optimum temperature between two randomly chosen points (or something).</p> <p>It also flashes up an enormous exclamation mark from time to time, which the instruction book classifies as a Serious Problem but which clearly isn't, and therefore has the eventual effect of the shepherd boy crying \"Wolf!\" But enough of the downside; during the petrol drought, it has been a wonderful aid to my efforts to squeeze hundreds of miles out of a 50-litre Ford Escort tank.</p> <p>We have to drive, those of us reporting for the Guardian outside London, and I regret to say that often we have to drive very fast, to follow the newsdesk's whims from Immingham to Clitheroe via, shall we say, Blyth. (\"Well,\" says the voice in London, \"They're only an inch apart on my map\"). To retain our ability to drive at all though experts reckon we should cruise at 56mph, no more, and a fascinating exercise it is.</p> <p>Pulling out of Leeds, uphill towards Harrogate, the winking red LCD shows horrendous levels of fuel consumption: 19.1 miles per gallon, 17.3, then up to a proportionately generous 27.5 as we ease into top gear. A plateau by the entrance to Esholt reservoir (happy memories of the Great Yorkshire Drought - this is where they built a whole new road for those other emergency tankers) and the figure soars to 38.6, then up through the 50s, 80s and, amazingly, as the run swoops down to Harewood and the Wharfe Valley beyond, a cracking 177 miles for every gallon. No! 220? I can drive to Morocco at this rate.</p> <p>For a novice, LCD-watching is terribly dangerous, a constant threat to the much lower accident statistics which are certain to come from the current period of a national attempt not to drive too fast. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents is sure about that. I just rang them on the carphone (hands-free but yes, I admit I was jeopardising the statistics even more) and they said though it was too early for figures, last time (the 1970s oil crisis), there had been a terrific drop.</p> <p>Three days of driving at 56mph or less tells you, uncontrovertibly, that they must be right. You don't get there as quickly (though in towns or trafficky runs like the M62, there isn't a huge difference), but you know that you are being much more safe. You are also being fabulously effective at saving petrol. I almost swore, on a stately trip to York and back last Tuesday, that the fuel gauge was lower when I started than when I got back.</p> <p>I shall try to keep this up, although I write that with the sinking heart of someone who knows that - like not having another bag of crisps or bar of chocolate - the resolution won't be kept. But there may be some converts; my journeys have involved lots of friendly grins at Audis and BMWs which would normally flash past, but are clearly following the same 56-max regime.</p> <p>The only dangerous moment, ironically, was when an enormous lorry thundered up behind on the motorway, flashing and roaring because I was in its way (overtaking another wagon in the lane to my immediate left). It seemed a bit mean, especially when the danger of hauliers' \"rolling blockades\" was playing havoc with Yorkshire motorways. But as Tony Blair has discovered, it's best to avoid confrontations with 32-tonners.</p>",
  "As petrol station across Britain struggled to get back to normal today, chancellor Gordon Brown, dug in his heels against any early tax concessions on fuel prices before next March, despite a 60 day deadline for action imposed by pickets when they lifted their crippling blockades. <p> With Tony Blair's full support, Mr Brown let it be known that he will not be deflected by what ministers insist are \"illegal blockades and intimidation\" in reaching his budget judgment as usual in March. Downing Street believes its firm stance will win round public opinion as tempers cool. </p> <p> A senior No 10 official said: \"These people have got to take on board the facts of the budget process. You cannot make budget decisions as a response to protests. There is a budget process and a parallel democratic process. They can make representations if they wish.\" </p> <p> However, the government's strategy is high risk given the scale of action and strength of feeling shown this week. Protesters - who include farmers, hauliers and fishermen, already aggrieved at what they see as unfair treatment by the government - have threatened to reimpose blockades of oil refineries and depots if there is no move to cut fuel taxes. </p> <p> During another day of drama which saw Esso, impose a provocative 2p-4p a litre increase - only to withdraw it within four hours after a meeting with Mr Blair - ministers breathed a collective sign of relief as the worst crisis of their government began to wind down. </p> <p> It is expected that by 3pm tomorrow, many garages will be restocked, though a \u00a310 limit of petrol per motorist may be implemented. Some motorway service stations are already re-stocked, though there are queues of up to two miles long for the fuel.</p> <p> Meanwhile, the NHS remained on red alert today, and supermarkets appealed for an end to panic buying after nervous shoppers cleared shelves of essentials such as bread and milk. </p> <p> Postal services have been reduced to just one collection and delivery a day by the Post Office as stocks of fuel for its 36,000 vehicles came close to running out, and more than 70 schools across Britain were closed. </p> <p> Jack Straw, the home secretary, will head a joint team with the industry to ensure there is no repetition of this week's rapid crisis, though Blair aides are confident the threat to restore pickets if no concessions are made by mid-November will not materialise. </p> <p> Angry pickets voted throughout yesterday to end the crisis and claimed a \"a great moral victory\", though pockets of resistance continued. When Esso announced its increase to protect profit margins some pickets threatened to restore their blockades and motoring organisations called the increase \"insensitive\". </p> <p> Though Mr Blair rejected calls for an Office of Fair Trading investigation of the oil firms Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, may yet decide to instigate one. Most of the companies - making record global profits, it emerged yesterday - promised to absorb any losses from the blockades. </p> <p> The prime minister's anger over yesterday's short-lived fuel price rise was evident at the press conference. \"I cannot really understand that Esso decision. The world oil price, as far as I'm aware, has actually come down in the last few days.\" He repeated the message in private to industry leaders. Despite speculation that he will cut vehicle excise duty for lorries or reduce taxes on petrol Mr Brown, whose annual pre-budget report is due in mid-November, is adamant that he will not be bounced. Mr Blair told reporters the government is willing to listen, and to meet groups with \"genuine and sincerely held grievances\". </p> <p> But \"to lurch into some short-term fix with emergency budgets and the like would not just be irresponsible, but the effect on the country's financial standing and credibility would be immediate and catastrophic\", he insisted. </p> <p> In a downbeat assessment Mr Blair warned that \"lives have been and are still at risk\". He admitted that mistakes had been made and appealed to voters to \"carefully reflect on recent events. However much people may dislike paying petrol duty there's no way that any government of this country could or should yield to this form of protest\". </p> <p> After regaining control of their worst spontaneous crisis yet, ministers are gambling on rallying public opinion and on western efforts to persuade Opec, the oil producers cartel, to increase production and cut prices - a move which may damage the government's green credentials. Despite savage attacks by William Hague and his allies in the Conservative press - the government had itself provoked this \"taxpayers' revolt\" the Tory leader said - Mr Blair has been comforted by the \"extraordinary unity\" among Labour supporters and unions. </p> <p> Government sources said the crisis was turned round at a crucial stage by senior Transport and General Workers union officials persuading members in the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland to break the blockade in a convoy. </p> <p> The deal, relayed to protesters around 2am yesterday, persuaded pickets ouside the refinery that it would be better to retreat in an orderly way while still claiming the high moral ground. At the same time, protesters at the Stanlow refinery in Cheshire - where the action started more than a week ago - also decided to abandon their blockade while they still had public support. </p> <p> Privately ministers believe they can persuade voters that tough decisions on public spending - including petrol taxes - are crucial to a buoyant economy which in turn funds improved health and education. </p> <p> Mr Hague gave notice that Alan Milburn's declaration of an NHS red alert will be investigated. </p> <p> \"The most disgraceful spinning of the crisis came from the health secretary - and we will be examining very carefully what he said and did this week,\" he said last night. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> t.</p>",
  "The British officer at the heart of the Sierra Leone hostage crisis faces disciplinary action for making \"a grave mistake\" in allowing his patrol to be captured by the West Side Boys. <p>An internal army report given yesterday to Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, went some way towards explaining how 11 well-trained and armed British soldiers could be overwhelmed by the indisciplined militia. </p> <p>The officer had been expecting the village of Magbeni to be free of West Side Boys but within five minutes they had been surrounded by 25 volatile and excitable members of the renegade militia. A truck, on which twin machine guns were mounted, was then positioned behind the Royal Irish regiment patrol. </p> <p>Their officer, Major Alan Marshall, who was wounded in the incident, judged the position to be untenable. The MoD has not revealed why he went to Magbeni in the first place, but said last night it was still talking to him and would be able to further clarify the sequence of events tomorrow. </p> <p>The MoD said Maj Marshall would be dealt with by the commander of UK land forces, General Sir Michael Jackson. A court martial has been ruled out because military law was not broken, but there are other avenues for disciplinary action. Some form of reprimand, which would go on his record, is expected. </p> <p>In a statement issued last night the MoD said Maj Marshall \"made an error of professional judgment in diverting from a planned and authorised journey so as to make an unauthorised visit to the village of Magbeni on the banks of the Rokel creek\". </p> <p>The troops' capture was a humiliation for the army and cost the life of an SAS soldier in the rescue mission last weekend. </p> <p>The Royal Irish regiment was in Sierra Leone to train its army to fight the rebel Revolutionary United Front. As part of the regiment's defence responsibility, Maj Marshall had been authorised to visit a Jordanian contingent of the UN peacekeeping force on August 25. On the way back, he diverted to Magbeni, known to be a West Side Boys base. </p> <p>\"On arrival, they encountered West Side Boys who became excited and aggressive. They moved a truck with twin machine guns behind the patrol vehicle. </p> <p>\"In all, about 25 West Side Boys were present. Very quickly the patrol was enveloped and the soldiers disarmed. The major was struck. The whole incident lasted five minutes,\" said the MoD's report. </p> <p>They lost their assault rifles and three Land Rovers, one of which was equipped with a powerful machine gun. </p> <p>Five soldiers were released before the army decided to go in on Sunday, fearing for the lives of the remaining six after the West Side Boys began carrying out mock executions. </p> <p>The MoD accepted that liaison with the Jordanians was a necessary and normal part of preparing defences by obtaining intelligence. Orders will now be changed to make it clear that diversions are not acceptable in such a volatile situation.</p>",
  "<p>John Lewis Partnership yesterday warned its 50,000 employee partners that their bonuses would be lower this year because of a \"sharp\" decline in profits. </p> <p>However the retailer, which last year fended off rebel partners who wanted to shake up its ownership structure, revealed that some of the partners are in line to share in a \u00a36m windfall under an accrued holiday pay scheme. </p> <p>Its profits slumped by 43% in the first half of the year - in part because of the four-year, \u00a380m refurbishment of its flagship Peter Jones store in Sloane Square, London. </p> <p>The interim profits were also knocked to \u00a338.5m because of the costs associated with incorporating 11 Somerfield stores into its Waitrose food chain as well as the \u00a36m cost of accrued holiday pay. </p> <p>The boost to partner's pay dates back to an industry-wide arrangement in place until June 1986 under which non-managers received unpaid holiday leave in their first year. </p> <p>Under the terms of the deal, non-managers received the year's holiday pay on their retirement at the rate of pay they received during their final year with the company. </p> <p>Now they will be able to choose to take the payment before reaching retirement. </p> <p>Sir Stuart Hampson, chairman of the partnership, acknowledged the steep decline in profits was a \"serious set-back\" and a reflection of the \"pincer grip\" of falling prices to consumers and a rise in the group's cost base. He said it was now a \"fact of life\" that price rises could not be passed on to customers - which helped explain why an 8.3% rise in sales in the department stores had failed to feed through to higher profits. </p> <p>The stores are now looking at extending their trading hours, and will will also maintain their price pledge - \"never knowingly undersold\" - to purchases on the net. </p> <p>\"Realistically, we must expect our full-year profits to fall way short of those of 1999,\" Sir Stuart said. The implications are clear. With 20 weeks ahead of us it's a matter of partners playing their part to win sales and to keep control of costs so that we bring home the best result we can.\"</p>",
  "<p>Japan vented its anger yesterday at a US threat to impose sanctions on it for hunting two endangered whale species. </p> <p>Washington says the expanded hunt is a move towards resuming commercial whaling. The issue is fast becoming the angriest between the two countries in years. Japanese fishermen have been barred from US territorial waters. </p> <p>Japanese ministers called the sanctions threat \"deplorable\" yesterday and said it contravened the international treaty on whaling. President Bill Clinton has started a process that could lead to economic sanctions in 60 days. </p> <p>Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, refused to recall the four ships at the centre of the bilateral storm. They are in the north-west Pacific to harpoon 10 sperm whales and 50 Bryde's whales for the first time since an international moratorium on commercial whaling began in 1986. Japan says the kill from the two species - both protected under US law - is important for research purposes. This is in addition to its usual cull of more than 100 minke whales. The meat from such hunts will end up as gourmet dishes in restaurants for Japan's elite. </p> <p>The government spokesman, Hidenao Nakagawa, hinted that Tokyo was ready to complain to the World Trade Organisation: \"If import restrictions are put in place, we will respond in line with the rules.\" </p> <p>In private, Japanese officials say the Clinton administration is trying to woo environmentalists for Al Gore, the Democrats' presidential candidate. </p> <p>Few Japanese eat whale meat, which is very expensive, and most seem indifferent as to whether it is available. But the government is determined to keep whaling alive in the face of perceived western cultural imperialism. It says a limited hunt does no damage.</p>",
  "A London headteacher who will next year become the most highly paid head in the state sector when he takes over a failing school defended his new salary of \u00a390,000 a year yesterday. <p>The details emerged as the government prepared for the launch today of the first of its network of city academy schools, a type of urban secondary to replace schools that are failing or under-achieving. They will be outside the control of local authorities, offering a major role for the private sector and \"new approaches to staffing\" which could include higher salaries and bonuses to retain the best staff. </p> <p>Headteachers' leaders yesterday welcomed Michael Murphy's appointment to Crown Woods comprehensive in Eltham, south-east London, and said salaries of \u00a390,000 were still \"light years\" away from the extortionate amounts paid to football managers and \"fat cat\" businessmen. </p> <p>Recruitment specialists said the top advertised salary to date for a head was \u00a378,000. The government has agreed to pay \u00a370,000 to \"superheads\" who have taken over fresh-start schools. </p> <p>Mr Murphy was offered the Crown Woods job by Greenwich borough council on a salary of just over \u00a371,000, when he was already being paid \u00a385,000 as head of Hurlingham and Chelsea school. </p> <p>\"I said that if they wanted me to the do the job it was not unreasonable to pay me a higher salary than I was already getting,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>Over the past six years as head of the once highly unpopular Hurlingham and Chelsea school - which had the worst results of any London secondary - he increased the proportion of pupils getting five good grades at GCSE from 6% to 27% and nearly trebled the roll from 400 to 1,100 pupils. </p> <p>The school featured in a government video on performance-related pay on the strength of its performance management system for teachers. </p> <p>Crown Woods school had been put on \"special measures\" by inspectors. But Mr Murphy said that although the new job would be challenging he felt the school's problems could be tackled with \"simple solutions which do not require rocket science\". </p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"This is a sign of the times and a shape of things to come. It proves the rather obvious point that if you want to get the best then you are going to have to pay for the best. This is market forces at work, just like in the private sector.\" </p> <p>Today the government gives details of the first city academies in its Excellence in Cities programme, likely to include schools in London and the north-west. David Blunkett, the education secretary, aims to have six academies established in the scheme's first year.</p>",
  "An accolade for marketing the world's runaway top-selling halitosis detector went yesterday to a company which has found a road to riches chiefly by embarrassing and terrorising Americans. <p>The Japanese firm Tanita earned a place in the new Guinness Book of Records - alongside three patient Britons who between them have split a hair more than 17 times, made 819 strictly background appearances in The Bill on television, and collected 683 different crisp packets from 15 countries. </p> <p>Tanita's $29.99 breath monitor, Fresh Kiss HC-201, marketed under the slogan \"Check yourself ... then take action before anyone notices\", has had sales of 800,000 in its first year, Guinness World Records said yesterday. </p> <p>Its promotional leaflets warn that \"as many as 95% of Americans have 'morning breath' and 40% suffer from chronic bad breath. Even your best friend probably won't tell you. You might be the last to know.\" It claims to work by \"measuring the volatile sulphur compounds given off by bacteria in the mouth\". </p> <p>Among the Britons, Alfred West has split a hair 17 times (into 18 parts) on eight occasions; Frank Ritter has collected the crisp packets; and Vic Galluci's role in The Bill is as Detective Constable Tom Baker, \"who is often seen in the background leaning against filing cabinets and shuffling papers\". </p> <p>The world's youngest DJ, Llewellyn Owen, of King's Cross, London, was paid the standard rate of \u00a3125 an hour for working at the Warp club in London in May when he was eight.

He took two hours to fill a sheet of paper. </p> <p>Sixteen years, seven manual typewriters, 1,000 ink ribbons and 19,990 sheets later, he reached his target: he typed \"one million\".</p>",
  "The attempt to save the life of the conjoined twin Jodie at the expense of her weaker sister, Mary, \"should be regarded as morally impermissible\", the archbishop of Westminster told the court of appeal yesterday. <p>The Most Rev Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, said the family should be allowed to leave the country, if they wished, and take up an offer of care in Italy. </p> <p>He was making an unprecedented intervention in the life-and-death dilemma over the twins, who were born at St Mary's hospital, Manchester, on August 8. </p> <p>Without an operation it was originally expected both would die within six months, although fresh information came to light in court yesterday which suggested they could survive longer. </p> <p>On the fifth day of the appeal from the girls' parents against a high court ruling that they should be separated, the archbishop made written submissions to the judges. </p> <p>He set out arguments stemming from the belief \"that God has given to humankind the gift of life, and as such it is to be revered and cherished. </p> <p>\"Though the duty to preserve life is a serious duty, no such duty exists when the only available means of preserving life involves a grave injustice. </p> <p>\"In this case, if what is envisaged is the killing of, or a deliberate lethal assault on, one of the twins, Mary, in order to save the other, Jodie, there is a grave injustice involved. </p> <p>\"The good end would not justify the means. It would set a very dangerous precedent to enshrine in English case law that it was ever lawful to kill, or to commit a deliberate lethal assault on, an innocent person that good may come of it - even to preserve the life of another.\" </p> <p>The archbishop called for respect \"for the natural authority of parents\" and said this could be overridden only where there was clear evidence they were acting \"contrary to what is strictly owing to their children\". </p> <p>\"In this case the parents have simply adopted the only position they felt was consistent with their consciences and with their love for both children.\" </p> <p>The parents are devout Roman Catholics who believe it is not God's will that the twins should be separated, though both will die if they are left conjoined. </p> <p>Doctors say an operation could give Jodie a chance of a full life but will mean killing Mary, who has a primitive brain and lives only because she is attached to her \"bright and alert\" sister. </p> <p>Were Jodie to survive separation, subsequent surgical and other care for her would impose \"excessive burdens\" both on Jodie and her parents, the archbishop said, which also justified declining the operation. He urged the appeal judges to reverse the decision of the high court and not to grant the declaration being sought by the Central Manchester healthcare trust and doctors at St Mary's. They want a ruling that it would be lawful to separate the twins. </p> <p>Surgeons will continue to monitor their progress over the next week or so before deciding whether to advance the date of any operation. The appeal judges expect to give their ruling next Friday.</p>",
  "The censor is to take a much more relaxed attitude to sex in 18 certificate films in the first formal loosening of Britain's relatively prudish screen code. <p>The British Board of Film Classification said yesterday it would now \"only rarely\" cut explicit scenes after a six-month consultation process found the public would rather make up their own minds about what was acceptable. </p> <p>But the new liberal mood to sex - which extends to some degree to violence - disguises a far more restrictive line on drugs and bad language in films aimed at younger audiences. </p> <p>In the commercially crucial 15 category - where the board has frequently been at loggerheads with film-makers who view the 18 certificate as a box office death sentence - strong language will \"only be rarely acceptable\". </p> <p>After the recent furore over the \"ludicrous\" 18 rating given to The End of the Affair, there is to be a more permissive attitude to sex in 15 certificate films. </p> <p>Significantly, however, the relaxation applies only to its depiction in \"responsible, loving and developing relationships\". Casual sex, the board warns, should be \"handled responsibly\". </p> <p>Last night Pact, the producers' alliance which represents the bulk of British film-makers, gave the changes a cautious welcome but claimed there was a \"touch of moral panic about them\". </p> <p>The guidelines show their teeth in the depiction of drug use. All mention of them in U films and videos will be banned, references severely curtailed at PG, 12 and 15 levels, while scenes akin to those in Trainspotting which give \"instructive detail\" in 18 certificate films will be cut. </p> <p>Robin Duval, the BBFC's director, revealed that if Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction - in which John Travolta played a hitman with a heroin habit - came before him now, he would consider cutting it. </p> <p>Mr Duval admitted that with film-makers like Tarantino and his many imitators there were \"difficult calls to be made between promoting and portraying violence\". He said the board was now prepared to \"take extreme action\" against films which promoted such cruelty. </p> <p>The board's president, Andreas Whittam Smith, who is seen as steering a more conservative course than the previous regime under James Ferman, said he had worries about the blurring of the line between \"comic or stylised violence\" and scenes which revelled and gloried in it. </p> <p>He said he aimed to alter the guidelines every few years in line with changing attitudes, but warned that this \"does not mean they will shift in the same direction\". </p> <p>The new rules were \"not a sea change\" but simply a clarification of the way decisions were now made. Even so, Mr Whittam Smith admitted the BBFC would still find itself \"in a pickle\" with the growing trend towards \"naturalistic\" sex scenes in arthouse films like Romance and Seul Contre Tous. He said the board would never be able to pass anything which conflicted with the Obscene Publications Act. </p> <p>But he made a stout defence of the board's decision to be less proscriptive about sex scenes in 15 films. </p> <p>\"We have the toughest guidelines in the world on film already and still we have the highest level of teenage pregnancy,\" he said. \"We have the power to intervene and cut which they do not have abroad, we have mandatory certification, and we also control the video market.\" </p> <p>The BBFC's decision to err on the side of tolerance at 18 comes after it was forced to relax the rules on sex videos after being defeated in the high court earlier this year. The explicit R18 films are available only through licensed sex shops. </p> <p>But the new guidelines themselves follow a study, Sense and Sensibilities, commissioned by the board a year ago into public attitudes. </p> <p>The research showed 56% of those surveyed thought young people used bad language because of what they heard in films. Nearly half, however, thought adults should be allowed to watch real sex on the screen. </p> <p> <b>Censorship ... and sensibility</b></p> <p><b> Sex</b> <br>The End Of The Affair - and Ralph Fiennes' offending buttocks - will now pass as 15 rather than getting an 18 rating, while the difficulty in passing \"real sex\" scenes in arthouse films like The Idiots and Romance are now eased because they can be \"exceptionally justified by context\". </p> <p><b> Violence</b> <br>The more liberal line on the 18 rating means The Fight Club, in which Brad Pitt and Edward Norton starred as corporate suits who relaxed through bare-knuckle boxing, would now pass uncut. Last House on the Left, the only film the BBFC refused to certify this year, would still not pass because of its \"incendiary mix of sex and violence\". </p> <p><b> Drugs</b><br> Several scenes in Trainspotting which could be interpreted as giving \"instructional detail\" on drug-taking could now go, while \"if Pulp Fiction were to come to us now, we would look at that scene where we see John Travolta in a car high on heroin with a little more concern\".</p>",
  "The number of trade unionists killed for organising workers around the world was 140 last year, an increase of 17 on 1998, with torture, beatings and imprisonment also on the rise in an increasingly anti-union global environment, according to a survey by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. <p>Latin America is the world's most dangerous region for trade unionists, with 90 killed in 1999 because of union activity and the widespread jailing and torture of activists. </p> <p>Colombia is the undisputed capital of anti-union terror with 69 assassinations of trade unionists, often by government-linked paramilitaries - bringing to 1,336 the number of unionists murdered in the country since 1991 - and hundreds kidnapped or forced into exile. </p> <p>Among those murdered was Cesar Herrera Torreglosa, a leader of the agricultural workers' union, who was assassinated in a drive-by shooting last December. An organiser of banana workers in northern Colombia, he had reported death threats to police, who took no action. </p> <p>Killings of trade unionists during strikes and demonstrations took place in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador. Nearly 3,000 trade unionists were jailed in Latin America and levels of exploitation, particularly in the Central American export processing zones, are reported to be intensifying. </p> <p>In Asia last year, 330 members of the Nepalese Teachers' union were murdered; a Turkish union leader died in police custody, while another was assassinated; and Indonesian union protests were broken up with beatings. In Burma, the army shelled a village that was to host a union-sponsored human rights event. </p> <p>Across the continent there was heavy anti-union repression, particularly in export processing zones used as magnets to attract foreign capital. Market reforms in China have given rise to strikes and protests, which, according to the report, are frequently broken up by force. In Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, trade unions are banned. </p> <p>In eastern Europe, where market reforms have gone much further, nine trade unionists were killed in 1999, including several in Russia. Disputes about unpaid wages and deteriorating working conditions across the region attracted widespread harassment and violence against union activists, as sweeping restrictions on trade union rights were introduced. </p> <p>Anti-union repression is also widespread in Africa. The ICFTU cites, among other cases, the death in prison of two teachers' leaders in Ethiopia last year, the beating and arrest of strikers in Kenya, the imprisonment of strikers and the deaths of trade union leaders in Morocco, and the torture of union activists in Togo.</p>",

  "I wonder if the country's fuel supplies wouldn't be safer in the hands of Rupert Murdoch (Drivers told 'not to go out', September 14). During the months of the Wapping dispute of 1986, not a single edition of the Sun, News of the World, Times or Sunday Times was prevented leaving his plant by the presence of pickets. There were often thousands of them; they were angry; and most were in direct dispute with Murdoch, who had stopped their wages. And yet every night the lorries rolled out, some of them possibly driven by the same gents now sunning themselves in small groups outside oil depots. <p>How was this possible? Because Rupert and his management willed it and because a sympathetic government made sure the police kept the exit open. This was a large and expensive operation. Sometimes mounted police were drafted in. There was at least one pitched battle. Newspapers may not be as inflammable as petrol, but nobody should doubt that the safety of many drivers was put at risk many times, as well as, occasionally, the lives of police and pickets. In a way, the police permitted the fundamental reshaping of the newspaper industry, just as, a few months earlier, they helped the restructuring (or destruction) of the coal industry. </p> <p>These results may have been good or bad or just plain inevitable. The questions now are: where is the impartial application of the law? Where is the will of the oil companies? And who are we to think of as \"the enemy within\"?<br> <b>Ian Jack</b><br> Editor, Granta <a href=\"ianjack@grantamag.co.uk\">ianjack@grantamag.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 The task for the government is to tackle the justifiable concerns of farmers, some hauliers and small businesses over the sudden rise in fuel costs, while maintaining its already slow course towards the Kyoto targets. This is a real test of political leadership and will demonstrate if the cabinet has more intellect than a mere collection of focus group results. </p> <p>The government can start by talking to the protesters and looking at its short-term increase in VAT receipts and committing them to rural transport users. In the long term, we must move from the crude penalisation of motor car use to a more sophisticated taxation of unnecessary use, for example by taxing car parking in city centres. In the meantime, all of us must remember the way the oil companies have behaved during this crisis next time they plead environmental concerns.<br> <b>Simon Thomas MP</b> </p> <p>\u0095 Although I agree in substance with the director of Friends of the Earth (Letters, September 14), he and his counterparts in Greenpeace, Reclaim the Streets and other environmentalist and anti-capitalist movements that are happy themselves to employ direct action need to reflect on the extent to which their activities have legitimated the reactionary politics of the fuel-price protesters. Using \"our power as citizens to bring the corporations and politicians to account\" sounds suspiciously like what the fuel protesters think they are doing. </p> <p>Would it not be more appropriate to insist that policy should be made at Westminster and in Whitehall and not by \"citizens\" on the streets? But in that case, it has to be acknowledged that this principle applies to opposition to GM foods, motorway construction and so on, as well as to the present circumstances.

  "The opening ceremony of the 27th Olympic Games, the biggest and most costly event ever to be held in Australia, takes place today amid the biggest security operation in the country's history, for fear of terrorist attack or demonstrations. <p>In the light of the bomb blast at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, in which two people were killed and 110 injured, draconian measures, known as the Olympic security laws, have been pushed through parliament, bringing criticism from civil rights groups. Around 20,000 police officers, private security guards and army personnel will be on duty during the two weeks of the games, which have cost \u00a31bn to stage. </p> <p>A shoot on sight law gives the government the right to draft soldiers on to the streets and open fire on people, if they are considered to be a risk to security. </p> <p>Police fear that anti-capitalist demonstrators, who rioted in Melbourne this week during a meeting of the World Economic Forum, and aboriginal rights activists might target the opening ceremony. </p> <p>Police have the power to search and photograph people and take them away if they are believed to be creating an \"annoyance\" or \"inconvenience\" in Sydney or in and around the Olympic park. </p> <p>Any activity or demonstration requires permission from the police, while people can be searched without permission, prevented from distributing material of any sort and barred from collecting money. </p> <p>More than 100 navy divers have been brought in to search Sydney's harbours, where events such as the triathlon and sailing will take place. </p> <p>Around 500,000 people are expected to visit Sydney during the games. The arrival of the Olympic flame was greeted by around 1m people last night, followed by a spectacular fireworks and laser show. </p> <p>For those who do not have tickets for events, six huge screens have been erected at various points in Sydney, where they will be able to watch the action and enjoy festivities and concerts. </p> <p>The police commissioner, Peter Ryan, said: \"Australia has always been tolerant of people wanting to express alternative views, politically or otherwise. But we will not tolerate this city being closed down. We will not tolerate any disruption to the Olympic Games. We are not going to have Australia embarrassed.\" </p> <p>Civil rights groups, however, have expressed concerns that police may continue to employ special emergency laws once the games are over. Amanda Cornwall, head of a Sydney-based group, said: \"These laws will leave Sydney with a bitter Olympic legacy.\" </p> <p>Extra security is being provided for certain teams, such as Israel and the US, for fear of attacks from political groups. </p> <p>Despite threats of disruption from protest groups and corruption scandals that have hit the International Olympic Committee, organisers believe that the Sydney games could be the most successful and lucrative ever held. </p> <p>According to the IOC, they will attract a global television audience of 3.7bn. They will be broadcast in 220 countries, while organisers claim to have already generated US$626m (\u00a3447m) in sponsorship. </p> <p>The sale of TV rights is expected to bring in around US$1.3bn (\u00a3929m), compared with US$895m (\u00a3639m) for the Atlanta games.</p>",
  "<p>British Nuclear Fuels plunged to a \u00a3337m loss last year - the worst in the company's history - after a series of controversies including charges of falsifying quality control data. </p> <p>The company reported a profit of \u00a3218m the previous year.

  "<p>South African group Liberty International has made a bid to take full control of Capital Shopping Centres, which owns the Lakeside complex in Thurrock, Essex, in the first step towards creating a retail property powerhouse. </p> <p>Liberty already owns 75% of Capital and is offering a mixture of cash and shares worth \u00a3400m for the rest.

We'd expect it to lead to further expansion in the shopping centres sector.\" </p> <p>In addition to Lakeside, Capital owns the newly built Braehead mall in Glasgow and the MetroCentre in Gateshead. However, the government has cracked down on out-of-town developments so future investment is likely to be in expanding existing sites and building town-centre complexes. </p> <p>Mr Fischel said many property companies were trading on the stock market at a discount to the value of their assets. This was \"bound to throw up opportunities\". </p> <p>Capital was originally part of Liberty, spun off six years ago when the parent company was largely involved in financial services. Liberty has since become a pure property company. </p> <p>Mr Fischel said: \"We've changed substantially. We're no longer under majority control from South African and we're now in the property sector.

  "Japanese police were ordered yesterday to start naming and shaming gangsters in a new attempt to crack down on the crime syndicates that are steadily infiltrating the mainstream business world. <p>Names, addresses and mob affiliations will be made public under the new policy, which was described by one lawyer as an attempt to force the gangsters - the yakuza - to show their tell-tale tattoos to society.</p> <p>The national police agency said the exposure was necessary because crime syndicates were becoming harder to identify as they shifted their operations into the realm of conventional business.</p> <p>At first sight, the plan to \"out\" the gangsters seems absurd: in their habitual garb, the yakuza are the peacocks of Japanese society, impossible to miss. They perm their hair, dress in Hawaiian shirts, and drive huge Mercedes cars through narrow streets.</p> <p>Their chests and backs are often covered in tattoos of mythical beasts, visible at public bathhouses and when they strip to the waist at Shinto festivals. If that is not enough of a giveaway, many lack a finger or two because the yakuza code requires a mobster to lop off a digit as a sign of contrition if he makes a mistake.</p> <p>But these ostentatious markings are being shunned by a new generation of gang members who wear Armani suits rather than kimonos and fleece big corporations rather than run brothels, drug rings and protection rackets.</p> <p>The change is largely a result of a 1994 law that restricted the activities of crime syndicates and made members liable for arrest for wearing syndicate lapel pins or passing out syndicate business cards.</p> <p>But Japan's continuing economic depression has made financial institutions vulnerable to the schemes of smart young yakuza, many educated at Japan's top universities.</p> <p>\"More and more crime syndicates are stealthily moving into new areas of society and business,\" said a police agency spokesman. \"We have introduced the exposure policy in response to a growing demand for information from groups worried about such activities.\"</p> <p>The police have identified 83,100 people in Japan who have close connections with criminal organisations; the 1998 figure was 81,300.</p> <p>Every police station in Japan has a list of local gangsters. This information, which was supposed to be kept secret to protect the privacy of individuals, has increasingly been leaked to private screening agencies.</p> <p>Under the new guidelines issued yesterday, police officers will be able to release limited data - excluding photographs and criminal records - on individual mobsters and on the location and activities of crime syndicates.</p> <p>The national police agency said disclosure would help financial institutions confirm whether potential borrowers have links with gangsters. The information would also go to firms doing debt collection and waste disposal, where syndicates are banned.</p> <p>\"This is what we have wanted for years,\" Naoguki Fukasawa, who heads an anti-gangsterism committee of the Japan federation of bar associations, said. \"The mobsters will no longer be able to hide behind privacy laws. They'll hate this move because it strips away a layer of protection.\"</p> <p>But old-fashioned gangsters interviewed yesterday were sanguine. At the Tokyo headquarters of the Inagawa-kai, Japan's third biggest crime syndicate, the burly office chief boasted that it would make no difference.</p> <p>\"I'm proud of being a yakuza. We are not cheap gangsters, so why should we want to hide?\" he said. \"Tell my neighbours, tell anyone. We have nothing to be ashamed about.\" He declined to give his name.</p>",
  "Tens of thousands of environmental activists plans to block the 26 border crossings between Austria and the Czech Republic today in protest at Czech plans to start up a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant in the next few days. <p>The organisers said they intended to use tractors and cars to prevent traffic crossing the border, and would set off nuclear warning sirens. </p> <p>The Temelin nuclear power station in southern Bohemia is due to start operating before the end of the month. Situated 90 miles south of Prague, 30 miles north of the border with nuclear-free Austria, and 38 miles east of Germany, it has become the focus of growing anger in the region. </p> <p>The Czech's western neighbours say it poses a huge safety risk to central Europe. The Czechs, who have spent more than 100bn crowns (\u00a31.7bn) on it - \u00a3687m over budget - insist that input by western experts has made it as safe as any in the west. Its safety control system has been upgraded to state-of-the-art by the US company Westinghouse. </p> <p>But it is is causing diplomatic tension between the Czech Republic and Austria. Earlier this month Austrian MPs called on the government to delay Prague's EU membership talks until the problem was resolved. They insist on EU safety checks being carried out. The EU has demanded an environmental impact study. </p> <p>An Austrian newspaper survey last week showed that 92% of Austrians believe Czech accession to the EU should depend on it abandoning Temelin. The Czech Republic is one of six countries in the first group of candidates in line for EU membership. </p> <p>The controversy has become entangled with a long-standing political dispute over the Benes decrees, which enabled the post-war deportation of 2.5m ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia to Germany and Austria. Many Austrian politicians want the decrees abolished as a condition of Czech membership of the EU. </p> <p>The Czech foreign minister, Jan Kavan, said this week that independent experts from both sides would visit Temelin before it went on stream to discuss the issues. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Vladimir Spidla, said that Czechs did not want to put themselves or their neighbours at risk. \"When putting Temelin into operation, the government will proceed in accordance with national and international habits and regulations, and we see it as our task to spread that message on a diplomatic level,\" he said. </p> <p>One of the organisers of today's protest, Rudi Anschober, leader of the Green party in the Austrian upper house, said: \"We want an immediate halt to the construction of the station, a six-month break for revision, a thorough environmental impact assessment according to EU standards, publication of all project documentation and neighbouring countries to have access to that information.\" </p> <p>Today's blockade follows lower-key protests on the Bavarian and upper Austrian borders. A further blockade of crossings between Bavaria and south Bohemia is planned on Sunday. </p> <p>The reactor has divided Czech MPs in recent weeks, but as the international pressure has grown, so too has the Prague government's tendency to see the plant as a test of national honour. </p> <p>Work on it began 16 years ago under communist rule and it was due to open in November 1992, in time for the 75th anniversary celebration of the Russian revolution. But it was interrupted by the fall of communism and shelved as an all-too poignant symbol of Soviet imperialism. </p> <p>The plant was resurrected by the then prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, on the grounds that additional energy was needed to meet the growing domestic demand. But most of its opponents insist that the republic already has an energy surplus and that Temelin's output will be dumped on the international market at 30% or so below production costs. </p> <p>\"We now export annually 12 terrawatt-hours, or 25% of the electricity we produce, and Temelin would produce a further 11 to 12 terrawatt-hours a year, doubling our overcapacity,\" said Jan Beranek, a nuclear campaigner for Friends of the Earth in Prague. He and other experts say the plant will never be able to pay for itself. </p> <p>The Czech energy company, CEZ, defends the safety of the plant, pointing out that 12 missions from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have visited it since 1990. </p> <p>But recently more and more whistle-blowers have been voicing concern about safety issues at Temelin. \"Several people, including skilled craftspeople and experts have approached us with information, because they said they couldn't live with a clear conscience about the irregularities they saw taking place,\" said Jan Haverkamp, an energy expert for Greenpeace. </p> <p>These allegedly include faulty welding, irregularities in testing and continuing water leaks in valves in the reactor cooling system. </p> <p>Greenpeace is concerned that at least one whistle-blowers has \"disappeared\" in the past few days. \"We simply can't find him. He might have got scared and gone underground, but we're worried that someone's tried to silence him,\" Mr Haverkamp said. </p> <p>Eastern Europe has 60 active nuclear reactors and 13 more under construction. Between 1991 and 1999 the EU invested more than 900m euros in the safety of plants in the region.</p>",

Ironically, it is the place where the Revolutionary United Front had its small intellectual beginnings, in the \"Green Book Group\" formed in the late 1980s to study Gadafy's sayings with a view to transforming Sierra Leone. </p> <p>From the heights of Mount Aureol, Freetown appears to be the orderly and prosperous habitation, laid out around its beautiful bay, that it emphatically reveals itself not to be when you descend. But those roomfuls of students give the lie to the idea that the younger generation in Sierra Leone is irretrievably spoiled by war. </p> <p>When British soldiers are seized by forces that are, or were, supposedly with the government, or when British trainers turn out to have inadvertently recycled known killers, there are those in Britain too ready to jump to the conclusion that there is not much to choose between the two sides. A degenerate culture of the gun is seen to embrace all the lost young men in the bush, whatever their allegiances. </p> <p>Certainly it is true that there is no combination more dangerous than that of uncontrolled young males, abundant stimulants and unlimited small arms. It is a disease that the rebels in Sierra Leone propagate, and the government side has not been free of it. But that is not to say that Sierra Leone is not worth saving, which some of the critics of Britain's role there come close to implying. </p> <p>What is the difference between Foday Kallay, leader of the group of West Side Boys that kidnapped the British soldiers, who has now been captured in turn, and those other young men bent over their examination papers, now presumably out looking for largely non-existent jobs ? It could be class, luck, timing, ethnicity or all of these. </p> <p>The point is that in a country where the normal co-exists with the horrific, the differences in the life-chances of individuals can depend on a few miles difference in where you live, a few years or months difference in age, or a few dollars more or less in your pocket. Saving Sierra Leone is, as much as anything else, about redressing the awful inbalance in life chances that the war has created. </p> <p>If Britain's intervention was purely military, it would be right to describe it as precarious. With just a couple of hundred British soldiers, we are engaged in a crash training programme to create adequate forces on the government side. It is a programme that is inevitably hurried and skimpy, and there is no guarantee that it can produce a force capable of beating the RUF, or one that might not turn on its own government - every previous bout of foreign military training in Sierra Leone has led to a coup, after all. </p> <p>The longer-term and more thorough military training programme that Britain has agreed to lead, helped by some other countries, will not now start until the security situation has improved. Meanwhile, the small British team is vulnerable, as recent events have shown. Finally, if the war turned against the government again and the UN forces could not cope, Britain would either have to return to Sierra Leone in strength or renege on a commitment that may not be written down but that most people, and certainly most people in Freetown, would regard as morally binding. </p> <p>But Britain's military presence in Sierra Leone is, fortunately, only a part of a broader policy. The combination of Kofi Annan's determination to ensure that UN peacekeeping does not come to an ignominious end in his own region, Britain's engage ment in Sierra Leone and Nigeria's return to democracy has changed west African politics. Britain has assumed a leading role in the security council discussions that have led to the strengthening of the UN force in Sierra Leone and the toughening up of its mandate. The increase in the size of the force, whose senior officers have been bitterly at odds, should also allow a new start with new commanders. </p> <p>The Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who is in London this week and for whom Sierra Leone is the single most important foreign policy issue, now has an opportunity to remove commanders who have colluded and traded with the RUF, as was charged earlier this year by the UN's Indian force commander, and replace them with cleaner men. </p> <p>To expect that the re-organised UN force will be militarily absolutely efficient, incorrupt, and free of national manoeuvrings would be utopian. But it should be better and, along with hoped-for improvements in the government forces, that ought to begin to tell against the RUF. </p> <p>This will be even more the case if the efforts to stem the flow of illegal diamonds, in which Britain has again played a central role, mean that this is the last year in which the RUF will be able to take full advantage of the diamond harvest. Success, if achieved, would bring problems. Down this road there is a difficult junction - the point at which a weakened RUF is ready to negotiate. Those who would prefer the campaign to be pressed to its conclusion, with a decisive defeat of the RUF the object, could then be in hard argument with those who would argue that an agreement would save lives, and who might have other, less commendable reasons for wanting a rump RUF to survive. </p> <p>The west has much for which it should atone in west Africa. The US pumped up the awful regime of Samuel Doe in Liberia, making no effort to restrain its excesses. It took no interest in, and admitted no responsibility for, the civil war that followed, of which the conflict in Sierra Leone is an extension. France played chauvinistic and reprehensible games in west Africa, as in other parts of the continent. Britain, once the outside power of the greatest importance to the region, could best be described during most of this period as inert. All western countries compromised and dealt with the increasingly bad military regimes that ruled Nigeria. </p> <p>But in recent years there has been a certain reawakening of the western conscience (not without the usual mistakes and arrogances) of which Britain's rather surprising return to Sierra Leone is part. Those who condemn it as foolish might bear in mind that the people on the ground very much want it to go on. As a professor at Fourah Bay College said about discussions in his classes on the country's future: \"People think, hey Britain, do your duty.\" </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Three Kings</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99)<br> Warner Cert 15 <br> **** <br> </p> <p> \"Are we shooting people or what?\" For a moment, you wonder if this is a film within a film, but Three Kings pitches you into the chaos of Desert Storm with its first line, which leads to random death for some distant \"towelhead\". David O Russell's movie plays fast and loose with war-movie traditions and skilfully juggles an exciting, dynamically edited action movie, a cynical screwball comedy and a coherent indictment of US foreign policy under Bush Sr.</p> <p> It juxtaposes the realistic and the bizarre with bravado: when Mark Wahlberg is being tortured, his oppressor keeps asking: \"What is the problem with Michael Jackson?\" (his lightened skin was seen as endemic of US racism - like the burning oilfields and oil-damaged birds seen here, it all seems a long time ago). Wahlberg is one of the \"three kings\" hunting gold Saddam stole from Kuwait. The others are George Clooney - continuing the smoothest TV-to-film star transfer since Woody Harrelson - and Ice Cube.</p> <p> The greedy trio are gradually and reluctantly involved in the politics around them. Any heroics they achieve are by opposing American policy, explained by Clooney as: \"Bush told the people to rise up against Saddam. They thought they'd have our support. They don't. They're being slaughtered.\" A rather pat ending apart, Three Kings is spot on and memorable. </p> <p><strong> Lake Placid</strong><br> Rental and DVD rental<br> Fox Path\u00e9 Cert 15 <br> ** <br> </p> <p> A monster movie that concentrates more on its characters than a rather unconvincing 30ft croc. It aims for quirky, and it's written by king quirk David E Kelley, the impossibly prolific Ally McBeal man. I was hoping for something like Arachnophobia or Tremors, but they worked by taking the genre seriously at the same time as subverting it. Lake Placid is too trite for that, with Bridget Fonda's parody New Yorker in the sticks taking centre stage, and its main joke is casting Betty White, the prissy one in The Golden Girls, as a foul-mouthed croc-feeder. </p> <p><strong> Ordinary Decent Criminal</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a315.99)<br> Warner, Cert 15 <br> ** <br> </p> <p> Not a bad trawl through the life of Martin Cahill if you haven't seen John Boorman's The General made just two years ago; rather a redundant retread for those who have. Where Brendan Gleeson made Dublin's most famous felon a bumpy, unpredictable character, Kevin Spacey's rogue gang-leader (called Michael Lynch) is just a smoothly superior robber effortlessly and consistently outwitting the police at every turn.</p>",
  "<p>Abbas Kiarostami has taken up two daunting challenges. First, the Iranian director, increasingly acknowledged as one of the most original film-makers working today, wants to preserve cinema's visual purity in the face of the current pyrotechnic overload. Second, he wants to give to cinema the advantage of the novel where the reader-spectator willingly visualises what is not actually shown. Before this is dismissed as grandiose bombast, it is worth pointing out that he has already achieved it - notably in Close-Up (1990), Through the Olive Trees (1994), Taste of Cherry (1996) and now The Wind Will Carry Us. </p> <p>Kiarostami's spectators are tamed into a degree of submission where they have to fill in visual (and even factual) gaps as audiences used to do for storytelling of old. It is a reaction against modern cinema's giddy infatuation with showing everything. His answer is to show less; tell less, and still mesmerise the viewer. </p> <p>So the ending of Through the Olive Trees concentrates uniquely on the protracted efforts of a young, illiterate peasant to get a sign from a young educated girl, orphaned by an earthquake, that she accepts his proposal of marriage. She walks off down a hill and across an immense valley. When she is in danger of disappearing into the distance, the boy runs after her, closing on her until he in turn almost disappears. </p> <p>By now we are hypnotised by these two distant dots, urgently needing to spot the signal which will satisfy our curiosity. Suddenly one of the dots - the boy - turns and begins to run back towards us; running, running. We are now focused on only one thing: the coming glimpse of this approaching face which will reveal the boy's state of mind. Before the dot becomes a face, the film ends. </p> <p>We have been conned, we realise, into watching two specks on the screen for minutes on end. At this point, the witlessly overweighted techniques of modern commercial film-makers, their work cacophonous with bullying detail, collapse into absurdity before the skill of a director who can keep us as spellbound as Hitchcock could, only watching two dots. This is mastery of suspense without violence; human feeling is the motor. Also, you cannot rid yourself of the film immediately: the mind still churns with the necessity of reliving the scene to look for clues. Kiarostami has it both ways: his way of showing less is to place less in a ravishing framework. Those radiant hills and olive groves are worth watching for themselves. </p> <p>In his latest film, The Wind Will Carry Us, there is a subplot of the courtship between a youth we never see - he is digging a deep well - and a young girl milking a cow in the dark whose face is constantly averted. (The Iranian religious censors, deeply suspicious that there might be something erotic here, have not yet given permission for the film to be released in Iran.) </p> <p>But cute variations on courtship are by no means the limit of Kiarostami's achievements; he also knows how to send up dependence on modern technology. There is, literally, a running joke involving the chief character in The Wind Willl Carry Us. He has come to a village in Iranian Kurdistan to record mourning rituals. But every time Tehran calls him on his mobile he has to dash, panting, to his car and rattle up the hills to get adequate reception. Meanwhile life and death in the village carry on at their own traditional pace. </p> <p>On his way home from serving on the jury of the Montreal film festival, Abbas Kiarostami stopped off in Paris last week where we met under the giant limbs of the Eiffel tower. The city's normal hubbub was upped a considerable few decibels by 3,000 taxi drivers hooting in a snail-crawl fuel price protest along the boulevards. The only rural landscape I could offer this teller of rural tales was to get him in amongst the shrubbery of the tower's garden. </p> <p>He is short, dark, quiet, courteous and candid. The one suggestion of vanity is a refusal to remove the dark glasses when being photographed: \"Nobody would know me without them,\" he explains. </p> <p>\"Whenever I get the opportunity,\" he says. \"I like to provide for film the advantage of literature. The usual way in film is to show something. But my aim is to create a cinema to see how much we can do without actually showing it. How much use we can make of the imagination of the spectator. </p> <p>\"You must be able to imagine what is going on beyond what is physically shown, because you are actually only showing a corner of reality. It is a good idea when pictures and action guide you to something which is outside the story without actually showing it.\" </p> <p>In Taste of Cherry, which won Cannes' Palme d'Or in 1997, a man drives around, trawling for someone who will help him commit suicide. None of his passengers asks why he wants to commit suicide. </p> <p>He clearly left that question out on purpose. \"So that everybody could have their own answer,\" he says. \"Allowing them to project their own difficulties and feel how it translates into their own daily lives. A lady in New York said: 'I am absolutely confident that the man was in love!' I am sure the lady herself was in love. And a businessman said: 'I think he was bankrupt.' I am certain he had financial problems. </p> <p>\"You see, when you have made a statement, you have only made that statement. But if you don't make any one statement you have all the others.\" </p> <p>Directors have occasionally attempted to use this kind of austere ambiguity - notably Antonioni in L'Avventura. But that was manifestly an intellectual exercise. Here we have ambiguity and reticence at the service of wonderful, humane storytelling. </p> <p>Kiarostami, who has just turned 60, began as graphic artist designing feature film titles. While working as a clerk in a police station, he enrolled in a fine arts school. In 1969, with a friend, he founded the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults. This eventually developed into the prestigious Iranian film studio which has produced, among others, Jafar Panahi, who last week won the Golden Lion at Venice. He began making short television films for children. Growing up in the Shah's Persia, there were two cinematic influences: American films \"which were far from our way of life, and the Italian neo-realists - De Sica and Rossellini - who were nearer\". This was the style he developed from. </p> <p>He and his wife, a designer, divorced 20 years ago; he has two grown sons, one in computers, another making publicity films. Although on his 10th feature and with increasing international fame, nothing is made easy for him. The story of the making of The Wind Will Carry Us underlines this. Even his film crew abandoned him. </p> <p>\"The conditions were very bad,\" Kiarostami said. \"The flies were terrible and some of the people lived with their cattle. We had to spend a huge sum of money - \u00a310,000 - disinfecting the houses with DDT. A film crew is used to comfort, but we had very little hot water and they didn't even have a pretty face to look at. I have refused to use artificial light for my last four films and the main problem was that Iranian crews don't work in the morning. But since the light goes quickly I needed them up at six in the morning. In the end they went off and I was left with my sound man and assistant cameraman to finish the film.\" </p> <p>In the village where they were shooting there is an ancient mourning ritual by which women cut their faces to express sympathy with a bereaved person. Women have been known to do this even when their husband's boss has a bereavement to ensure their husbands or sons keep their jobs. I assume that portraying women so debased by their economic circumstances that they would mutilate themselves in the hope of security must have been one of the points which angered the censors? </p> <p>\"For the past 20 years,\" says Kiarostami, \"the religious censors have unfortunately shown they do not pay any attention to economic problems. They were more sensitive about undermining religious ideas.\" </p> <p>One of the scenes the censors are creating problems with involves the young girl, who is milking the cow while the visitor from Tehran quotes from the love poem that gave Kiarostami his title - The Wind Will Carry Us, by Forugh Farrokhzad. A revolutionary poet, one of the first to deal with women's problems and explicitly with sex, Farrokhzad died in a car crash in 1967, aged 33. The censors also do not approve of the quotation from the celebrated 12th century Persian poem, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The verse runs: </p> <p>\" Some for the Glories of This World; and some<br> </p> <p>Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come; <br></p> <p>Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go, <br></p> <p>Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! \" <br></p> <p>How does he deal with the censors? \"By being patient,\" says Kiarostami. \"An Iranian official hardly ever remains in his position a very long time. When one goes and another comes, that is the best time to try again.\" </p> <p> Last year the UN asked Kiarostami to make a documentary on the plight of Ugandan children whose parents have died or are dying of Aids. \"I wondered at first why they had chosen me,\" he said, \"but of course I spent my first 20 years making films for children at the Tehran institute.\" </p> <p>He discovered that Uganda was not the land of savagery and horrific violence we believe it to be. \"This is potentially a very rich country with a happy and vigorous people,\" he says. \"They are dying, often without knowing what is happening to them. These villages were 200 miles from the nearest town and not only did they not have electricity, they didn't even have oil lamps or candles. So in the long dark nights they have nothing to do but make love, which they do very naturally and without guilt. Some religious groups put up posters urging women to remain virginal and be chaste.\" He laughs. \"Condoms make no impression on them. For them it is normal to undress to make love. They don't understand why you have to put on something to make love. </p> <p>\"What is amazing about these primitive people is how very polite and well-mannered they are. Where does it come from? Once a woman complained about my photographing her and called a policeman. He was the most courteous policeman I have ever met in the world. He was meticulous, made no attempt to undermine the lady's rights and sorted the matter out completely impartially. And he wouldn't accept a bribe, which would be normal in most countries.\" </p> <p>Kiarostami cannot tell me much about his next project, he says, except that he will start shooting this winter and this time it will be about city life. On leaving, I remark to his interpreter (the interview was in Farsi) how curious it is that truly talented people never make difficulties in interviews; it is only those of dubious ability who put up barriers. </p> <p>He replies: \"We have a saying in Iran. 'The fruitful tree bends.' \"</p>",
  "<p>These are scary days for Tinseltown's managerial caste, and there's no relief in sight - nothing but a series of ever more daunting confrontations with Hollywood's unions, and then quite possibly a showdown with the government itself. It's been a resoundingly poor summer at the movies, with takings down 6% on last year - admittedly, the biggest summer of all time, so this year was always going to be a let-down. But nobody was prepared for the string of duffers that befouled our screens. </p> <p>Having seen nearly everything that's been released, I can attest to my own disgust at the subterranean quality levels reached collectively by the studios. The firings have started already. A pox on them: let them sleep in their HumVees till the repo men show up. The studios are also faced with the likelihood of a series of destructive strikes that will embitter Hollywood labour relations for years to come, and possibly transform movies and American TV for the next couple of years. Already the Screen Actors Guild is at war with advertisers over performance residuals. </p> <p>Yet it is only the prologue to a wave of even more damaging strikes. It is universally believed that the Writers Guild of America and SAG will strike in May and June of next year, respectively, and unless things are worked out, the Directors' Guild of America will do the same a year later. And now that most studios are merely components of much larger corporations, the possibility of a deal brokered by Tinseltown's declining pool of big movers is much less feasible. The unions are talking to the monkey - the organ grinder couldn't give a stuff. </p> <p>As a result, studios are fast-tracking next summer's big blockbusters so that production will commence before the likely dispute takes all writers and actors out of the equation. The WGA has already warned its members to postpone large purchases and save. Movie exhibitors plan to up their purchase of foreign and independent movies (see, there is an upside) to compensate for a likely dearth of new movies. </p> <p>The net result of all this, the LA Economic Development Corporation estimates, will be a total of $636m per month in lost wages. And as Hollywood is reeling from all this, the Federal Trade Commission this week delivered the final kick in the nuts, when it issued its report on Hollywood's tactics for marketing violent R-rated entertainment to children under 17. The report cited the studios' marketing strategies - placing R movie ads in cartoon shows, on kids TV, MTV, even in comic books. </p> <p>Summoned to Washington on Wednesday for a Congressional grilling, the one studio representative who would agree to appear pulled out on Tuesday. And it's election season, in particular the part of the campaign where Gore needs to consolidate his slim lead over Dubya by temporarily being as rightwing as possible on cultural issues like this. And with the censor-happy, Hollywood-hating Joe Lieberman at his side, it was inevitable that the Democrats would make hay with the issue. (The Dems and the Hollywood crowd were getting on so well in LA last month, but that was all about soft money and ass-licking.) </p> <p>Inevitably the GOP got in on the act ( after the Dems, weirdly) sending in wannabe Second Lady Lynne Cheney - a philistine ex-head of the National Endowment for the Humanities - to meet with the committee. What with her, Tipper Gore, Lieberman and (for the time being) Prince Al himself, Dubya and \"Dick\" Cheney all firmly in the anti-Hollywood column of the ledger, we'll be electing a tightass bluenose whichever way we vote. When it comes to sanctimony and righteous indignation, this really is a One-Party State, and Hollywood, already reeling, will bear the brunt of their voter-sanctioned wrath. </p> <p><strong>The phantom menace</strong></p> <p> Nothing makes me happier than stories of big Hollywood stars acting like egomaniacal dickheads. This week we got the skinny on Titanic villain Billy Zane, and hitherto apparent \"nice guy\" Mike Myers, both of whom have recently been spotted throwing atomic tantrums and bullying the hired help.</p> <p> Zane got a doorman fired at LA's Standard hotel after the man tried to help some autograph hunters. \"How dare you?\" wailed the actor. \"I was in the biggest movie of all time!\" To which the doorman shot back pricelessly, \"Oh, you mean The Phantom?\" - referring to Zane's abysmal 1998 superhero flop. He was unemployed in minutes. I'd like to erect a statue to him. </p> <p>And a New York tabloid revealed some old stories of Myers' excesses on the set of Wayne's World, when he flipped out because the craft services table had no margarine - only butter. Wah! On the Austin Powers set he screamed and wailed at a grip who had the temerity to look Myers directly in the eye, and he reportedly later fired his manager Erwin Stoff when he refused to have a commercial jet liner turned around so that he could meet with Myers. \"I don't have that kind of arrangement with American Airlines, Mike,\" quipped Stoff, who remained in Myers' employ for exactly two more seconds.</p> <p> <strong> Doc in the dock </strong><br> </p> <p> The bizarre parallel universe of American talk radio is now largely the province of the barmy radical right. The two biggest talk shows have for several years been those hosted by fat reactionary blowhard Rush Limbaugh and his ghastly female equivalent, Dr Laura Schlessinger. She's been much in the news both for the forthright and hectoring advice she dispenses to her listeners, and for the nudie pix of her that showed up on the internet after she'd established her credentials as an intolerant, finger-wagging, family-values bigot of the first water. </p> <p>Schlessinger, a former radical feminist who used to rail at babies and husbands as a \"patriarchal conspiracy\", is now a deeply conservative, re-converted Orthodox Jew who dispenses tough-love shrink advice deriving primarily from the Old Testament's more rebarbative strictures and proscriptions. She's also a working mother who doesn't believe in day care, a divorcee who doesn't believe in divorce, and a family-values champ who hasn't talked to her own mother in 15 years. </p> <p>But she ran into big trouble with gays when she described homosexuality as \"deviant\" and \"a biological error\" and pointed to Jewish religious law when the boycotts began almost immediately. Full-page ads were taken out and a website (<a href=\"http://www.stopdrlaura.com\">www.stopdrlaura.com</a>) registered zillions of hits. Their biggest victory came when two dozen appalled sponsors withdrew their patronage from her planned TV show, which debuted on Monday. Sadly the broadcast - on the softball topic of \"Teens and Drugs\" - wasn't interrupted by abseiling drag queens or Act Up members in tight lederhosen waving copies of the infamous, 25-year-old \"dirty dozen\" photos (boobs, bush, big cheesy grin - the works) that a former lover unleashed on the internet in 1999. And lastly, why is a doctor talking - or yelling - at us about morals? What next? The Archbishop of Canterbury performing appendectomies? </p> <p><strong> Walk away, Renee</strong><br> </p> <p> Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has a right to feel cheesed off at Bridget Jones, who she plays in the forthcoming film. Having stacked on a few pounds to play the weight-fixated Jones, Zellweger was apparently judged by the editors of Harper's Bazaar to be a tad too chunky to function as their cover star next month. The denials flew from the Zellweger camp even though the weight-gain is an acknowledged fact, and was deliberately planned for a role anyway. \"She looked very uncomfortable,\" said a Harper's rep, \"and as a result, it didn't make for an inviting cover.\" Ren\u00e9e's people countered by claiming the mag was being neurotic about an actress carrying 10 extra pounds.</p>"
