  "<p>\u0095 Hyperlinks, they're a funny old thing. First BT claims that it invented them and decides the world should pay it huge sums of cash for the privilege of hyperlinking. Now, it seems that hyperlinking is being taken from one extreme to the next, with corporates laying down strict guidelines for the erstwhile courteous act of providing links to another company's site. A curious two-page document arrived in the Diary's inbox this week from Lloyds TSB, setting out the bank's rigorous demands for any site that wishes to provide a common-or-garden free link to <a href=\"http://www.lloydstsb.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.lloydstsb.com</a>. The days of informal referring of traffic appear to be well and truly over, that is unless you consent to sign a restrictive contract which binds you to check the link is working on a daily basis, and if your site changes in any way you are obliged to notify Lloyds TSB. But that's barely scratching the surface: the relationship, although in no way does the link imply any form of relationship, expires after a year unless it is renewed in writing, and... well, I could go on, but there's not enough space. However, the Diary has henceforth decided to start a ridiculous practice monitor, and will endeavour to bring to light any absurd policies. So send them in. </p> <p>\u0095 Never let it be said that journalists don't have any influence over people's decisions. While attending the e-women summer party last Thursday, the Diary was flabbergasted to learn that yours truly was the inspiration behind it all. Apparently, and this is straight from the mouth of founder Kathryn Bullock, a rant - arguing that women's websites were patronising and that women needed better representation - was the spark that lead to the formation of e-women. Such power. The Diary is now thinking of patenting future ideas and cashing in on companies that evolve from them - a slice of equity and non-exec board position should keep the ideas flowing nicely. </p> <p>\u0095 Fans and followers of Richard Lord, effervescent editor of trade rag Revolution, will be saddened by the news that dear old Dickie has been struck down by a mysterious Asian lurgy while out schmoozing in Hong Kong - under the pretence of setting up Revolution Asia. Mmm. Over at Revolution Towers, panic set in when news of Dickie's illness broke and it was deemed that he was far too ill to write his weekly tirade, sorry column. The simple explanation in the rag \"Richard Lord is unwell\" left so many questions unanswered - like where to send the flowers... does \"Screaming ad-dabs\" Dickie have enough Imodium... is someone looking after him? Thankfully Mr Reliable Phil Smith, deputy editor of Revolution, was at hand to step in and fill the blank space at the last minute, saving the day and the magazine from more nasty, unfounded rumours about its closure.</p>",
  "<p>Often described as the most formidable woman in British television, Patricia Hodgson is at the door of her new habitat, the chief executive's office of the independent television commission (ITC). She is beaming with pleasure; or it may be power. </p> <p>Minutes into the interview she has dispensed with the habitual caution of a BBC lifer and is speaking recklessly. Formerly John Birt's right-hand woman, she played the villain's part to perfection as his much-loathed director of policy and planning. Now she has left the BBC, she's \"going for it\", prepared to risk a showdown. </p> <p>Her agenda is to salvage the ITC from extinction: to fix the row with ITV over News at Ten by the end of this month; save the thing she cares about most - public service broadcasting - and ensure the forthcoming white paper on media, communications and \"convergence\" remembers that broadcasting has cultural obligations. No mean feat. </p> <p>As she sees it, the ITC, as the licensing body until new legislation comes in, has the power to make public service broadcasting worthwhile in business terms. It can cut the annual \"levy\" payments by ITV, and negotiate altered terms (\"don't call it relaxation\"), but in return for more programme investment. Seven licence-holders, including Central, LWT and Granada, are about to apply to renew their franchises and, consequently, renegotiate their annual licence payments. The ITC still controls some important levers and Hodgson has the nerve to use them. </p> <p>Her determination was apparent when she spoke at last week's Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival about the forthcoming white paper. Her appointment - she starts officially today - changes the balance of the regulatory environment. Her predecessor, Peter Rogers, was shy and decent but lacked the confidence of the industry; with his retirement, the ITC could become far more assertive. </p> <p>In her Edinburgh speech, she also gave her views on the BBC governors. \"They are needed,\" she said, \"to keep the BBC management honest. They should be strong enough to keep politicians at bay. But they, too, must be accountable. They can't convincingly embody the BBC and then also judge it.\" BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland accepts this, she says. </p> <p>Back to the ITC. \"I took the job because it is an opportunity to make a difference. The challenge is to achieve a new settlement for public service broadcasting, to take the free-to-air networks [ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5] into the new digital age over the next 10 years.\" It is very late in the day, she concedes, but possible. ITV is being offered a deal. She will move \"further and faster on [simplifying] regulation\", with the prospect of more \"flexible\" schedules and advertising controls. But it must keep faith with its most important public service duties, providing \"range and quality\" - above all, serious news and modernised current affairs. </p> <p>The clue to Hodgson is that she is a politician manqu\u00e9. At Cambridge she was a committee member of the university Conservative association, then worked for the Conservative Research Department, even contesting a London seat. She plays the political chess game like a grandmaster - unlike the ITC before her arrival, with its abandonment of News at Ten two years ago. The ITC has \"not been sufficiently confident of its skills and professionalism in a changing world,\" she says. \"It needs confidence.\" </p> <p>Her answer is strengthened leadership - ie, herself - and new recruits with economic and strategic expertise - presumably ex-colleagues from BBC policy and planning looking for a new world to conquer. The watchdog could then regain the ear of government. </p> <p>But the first aim, clear in Edinburgh, is a face-saving deal with ITV before it goes to court at the end of this month for a judicial review of the commission's edict effectively ordering the broadcaster to restore News at Ten. The two sides can \"talk up to the courtroom door,\" Hodgson says. </p> <p>She pounced instantly on an olive branch offered by Charles Allen, chief executive of Granada Media Group. Hodgson scents a deal. \"It's the first time anyone of great seniority and influence has wanted to talk.\" </p> <p>It is her good fortune to take over as ITV consolidates into two big power blocs, far easier to deal with, and when one awkward baron, Lord Hollick, is exiting. Salvaging the ITC's reputation rests on keeping this dispute out of court. \"We shouldn't be where we are,\" says Hodgson, insisting that \"it's not about the 10pm slot\" - though she repeats that \"11pm is too late\". She says there are plenty of other options now that the BBC is switching its news to 10pm; the important thing is to ensure optimum accessibility to improve audiences. </p> <p>Taking a line calculated to please politicians, Hodgson argues that \"however excellent the BBC news is, dominance by any news service is not good for democracy.\" Some news, she says, inevitably then \"gets left out\". </p> <p>If the dispute proceeds to judicial review, she says, \"it will tie my hands in modernising regulation [as ITV wants] ... I might have the best scheme in the world to simplify regulation, but how can we talk about it if we're having a great big barney?\" </p> <p>Her other priority is to mould the white paper on media convergence, and, one suspects, temper the drive, led by the Department of Trade and Industry, towards a telecoms-driven regime where social obligations scarcely feature. She is seeking recognition that terrestrial networks need \"transitional arrangements\" in which consumer protection and duties, such as investment in high-quality regional programmes, can be traded for privileges, such as guarantees of being given prominence on all platforms and electronic programme guides. </p> <p>But this is not what ITV executives seem to worry about in public. Rather, they cry out for a level playing field with freedom to dump genres such as religion and compete head-on with the likes of Sky. </p> <p>\"When their minds are focused, ITV executives recognise the validity of the requirements of diversity,\" Hodgson says. \"I have a good deal of sympathy with their frustrations. Now ITV is settling its ownership issues we'll start talking about the right mix of self-set aspirational and mandatory targets.\" </p> <p>She wants to open discussions with licensees and the government, and also see a proper digital strategy in place for ITV, akin to the BBC's which she helped to devise, and Channel 4's. \"My hope is to make content regulation simpler, clearer, less complex, to reflect all the things ITV complains of, but holding onto the essentials.\" She points to the success of the tougher yet aspirational Channel 4 licence agreement introduced two years ago as a model: multi-cultural programmes, for example, have been moved out of ghetto slots to prime time. </p> <p>In her Edinburgh speech, Hodgson asked: \"Will the multi-channel interactive world provide all the content audiences need?\" She, naturally, answered her own question: \"Given the power and pervasive nature of the electronic media, I think we'll continue to do so in a big way. How it's done, through the BBC, through privileges for some players on the commercial side, needs to be worked out. Someone has to do that, with, but independent of, government.\" It's a vision that handily keeps the ITC, or something like it, in business. </p> <p>Once described by Guardian writer Dave Hill as \"a woman apparently sculpted from deep-frozen Oil of Ulay\", Hodgson has never been short of detractors. Behind her back some of the important executives she has to rub along with range from sceptical to antagonistic (told this, she just says \"what fun!\"). Asked about hostile predictions that she will bring a bossy BBC perspective to a commercial sector where she has never worked, she counters that she \"learned a fair bit about the commercial world when I served on the monopolies and mergers commission [forerunner to the competition commission] for six years.\" Instead of \"nannying\" the network, her aim is \"a new deal - to achieve simpler regulations, and only when they're needed\". Far from imposing a BBC perspective, she backs further consolidation: \"One ITV is the target. It is not only inevitable, it is desirable.\" </p> <p>Another charge is that she has a personal agenda, to emerge from the expected cull of watchdogs as top dog, regulating the content of electronic media (and those BBC governors), within or outside of a new economic regulator, called perhaps Ofcom. She simply wants to ensure the ITC is respected, and works with other regulators to \"design together a new framework\", she answers. </p> <p>Those who admire Hodgson - citing such BBC coups as the renewal of its charter in 1996, and this year's licence fee settlement, which makes possible Greg Dyke's new programme spending - say she will be a very good thing for the ITC, and its currently anxious staff. And for viewers. </p> <p>At Edinburgh, Dyke used his MacTaggart lecture to opine that advertising-funded channels such as ITV will find it hard as television fragments. Hodgson responds with vigour. \"Greg is wrong. All free-to-air channels will be showcases for much bigger media companies. The money will be there. I love this sector, and I have an opportunity to get it right.\" </p> <p>Not to be under-estimated.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Age: </strong><br> 29. </p> <p> <strong> Who is he? </strong><br> MD of Keekaboo Cards Ltd, launching September 7. Previously worked as account director in advertising, sales promotion and live events. </p> <p> <strong> What's the clever idea? </strong><br> \"A completely new way of advertising on the web and bringing the virtual to the real. Keekaboo enables people to send real postcards via the internet for free. It should result in thousands of cards being sent each day, thousands of senders and recipients potentially exposed to each card design - an attractive proposition for any advertiser wishing to sponsor cards with their choice of image on the front and message on the back. Advertisers have been hankering after a more accountable, versatile way to reach their target audience on the internet, and the benefits are threefold - accountability, control and versatility. All card senders are encouraged to visit the advertiser's site through online links, all recipients receive a piece of branded direct mail which has been personally endorsed by a friend, and all advertisers only pay for cards that are sent. Keekaboo is an online traffic driver combined with an offline brand builder all in one postcard. In a pilot, Keekaboo cards got a 9% response. Direct marketing response rates are usually between 2 and 5%.\" </p> <p> <strong> What's the thinking behind it? </strong><br> \"The idea behind Keekaboo came up when Patrick van Zandvoort, the Dutch founder of the company, wanted to send a birthday card to his mother. He searched the web for a service which would allow him to write and send a real card online but only found virtual card sites. He saw the opportunity to launch a web service specialising in personalised cards chosen and sent online, but which arrive through the post.\" </p> <p> <strong> How does it work? </strong><br> \"Users come to the site <a href=\"http://www.keekaboo.com.\">www.keekaboo.com.</a> There they can choose a postcard, write a message, and address the card to the home/business address of the recipient (not the email address). The information is sent digitally to a printer who prints the card and posts it. The postman then delivers the card to the recipient. So the beauty is that it turns a virtual message into a real card, for free.\" </p> <p> <strong> Possible shortcomings? </strong><br> \"Free postcards and postage may not appeal to some consumers. Advertisers may not see the benefit of a medium which can reach both an off and online audience with one hit.\" </p> <p> <strong> What's next? </strong><br> \"Expansion outside of the UK, Spain and Netherlands into other international markets. Development for other platforms, including Wap.\"</p>",
  "<p>All copy was \"mince\" until Martin had improved it. All photographs were \"shit\" until Martin had cropped them. All page designs were a \"fucking disgrace\" until Martin had drawn them himself. Reporters were a waste of space, photographers were \"monkeys\" and sub-editors were so inconsequential that Martin deliberately forgot their names. There was no job at the Scotsman that Martin could not do better than the person he employed to do it. </p> <p>Clarke believed this. He arrived at the Scotsman accustomed to the driven world of London tabloids and brought his assumptions with him. Clarke thinks that being a journalist is fun. He thinks it is a privilege. So he assumes that every reporter pulls out all the stops every day simply in order to stay ahead of the pack barking at his heels. That's what he did to get the jobs he got when he was young. He worked like a Stakhanovite (though in the absurd way that he always seeks to hide his own intellect, Clarke would deny knowing who Stakhanov was). </p> <p>And, like many ostensibly ruthless bosses, Clarke was loyal to those who lived up to his expectations. That didn't mean being perfect. It meant trying. The image Clarke deliberately cultivated at every newspaper he ran - evil, certain, harder than a rivet - was all performance. Clarke would spend hours nurturing a young reporter who had done his best. He is a good teacher. He writes fast and incisively. He sees the point while others are still struggling to grasp the context. </p> <p>When colleagues were exhausted, Clarke could be compassionate. \"Take a week off,\" he told me. \"Relax. Don't think about this place. You've earned it.\" When I protested that I hadn't finished the leader, he just shrugged and said: \"I'll handle it.\" He never told colleagues that he had done so. Clarke had to behave like a tabloid brute. He hid his subtlety like an embarrassing illness. </p> <p>The stories of Clarke screaming at staff are true. I have watched him roar crude expletives into the face of a terrified reporter. I have seen adults cry after one of his cruel humiliations. His finger would jab inches from the victim's face. He stood close enough to overpower with the stench of stale cigarettes and fried breakfast (Clarke runs on heavy fuel - most days began with curt instructions to his secretary to get a fry-up and 60 Silk Cut). </p> <p>Female colleagues found him particularly hard to take. I remember a priceless moment at the Scotsman's news conference. Clarke: \"This schedule is pure shit. You're supposed to be working, not gossiping. Where's the splash? What the fuck am I going to put on the front page? You've got 10 minutes. Go and find some fucking stories.\" </p> <p>Female assistant news editor: \"That's yesterday's schedule, Martin. You liked it at the time.\" </p> <p>Clarke is a flawed character. He never needs alcohol or anything stronger to get his adrenaline flowing. He could work for 18 hours after just four hours sleep because he loves the whole game. Clarke without a newspaper to edit is a lost soul. He will find it hard to grasp that an ex-editor has no influence. </p> <p>So how did these ingredients fail at the Scotsman and the Record? For all the true stories about tantrums, Clarke is not reviled by good journalists. His problem is a siege mentality which increasingly prevented him distinguishing between good and bad advice. </p> <p>Scottish journalism is not cutting-edge. For years the big Scottish newspapers have been content with soft, consensual words and a thin parochial agenda. Clarke came with the conviction that if Scotland wanted national status it should have national journalism too. And that meant no more cosy deals whereby political correspondents were close friends of the politicians he wanted them to crucify. </p> <p>To Clarke politicians are \"cunts\". It's a word he uses with passionate abandon. He has a primitive democratic instinct which assumes that politicians are all liars and that newspapers exist to expose their mendacity. </p> <p>Clarke's demonic moral-majoritarianism was his biggest mistake. He did it to annoy. The Record's obscene campaign against repeal of Clause 28 was not about morality. Clarke is not prejudiced. He just found the performance of the Scottish executive so pathetic that he would do anything to infuriate the first minister. </p> <p>Clarke thought he could change a culture of complacency by force of character alone. Instead of compromising when he must have known the effort was crippling him, he just became more driven, more deliberately vile and more obsessive. That's how most will remember him. I prefer to recall the razor-sharp mind and deep background knowledge. He will succeed when he allows the sophistication he has buried beneath his armour to return to the surface. </p> <p>Clarke was curiously good for Scottish journalism. He set standards. They were too often nasty and harsh - Clarke's mistakes became more spectacular as his career failed - but things will never be as complacent as they were before his arrival. Martin should team up with that other great iconoclast, Andrew Neil. Between them they could run a very good title - but probably not in Scotland.</p> <p>\u0095 Tim Luckhurst is a former editor of the Scotsman. In 1997, he was assistant editor under Martin Clarke.</p>",
  "<p><strong>BODY BEAUTIFUL</strong></p> <p>Imagine, Arsenal fans, that you were Dr Frankenstein. Imagine you had enough demonic power - and, of course, electricity - to create your perfect central defender. Obviously he would be big, strong and able to shoot his hand up for offside even in his sleep. That much goes without saying. And a penchant for near-post flick-ons and the West End play 'Art' would be nice too. Hang on a minute though, that's a perfect synthesis of Tony Adams and Steve Bould - and surely that's impossible! </p> <p>Well think again, because that defender already exists. His name is Igors Stepanovs, he's a Latvian international and - control yourself you Gooners - he's signed for Arsenal. \"Igors can definitely do a job in the Premiership. He is in the same mould as Tony Adams, which is why he will fit in so well at the Arsenal,\" said Graham Johnson, Latvia's English coach (who, in case you're wondering, used to manage Cambridge). \"The lad was magnificent against Scotland [at the weekend],\" Johnson went on. \"Steve Rowley [the Arsenal scout] was full of praise for the lad and thought there was a bit of Steve Bould in his game as well.\"</p> <p>That's some billing, and the 6ft 3ins centre-back could prove his worth as soon as this Wednesday. Because with Tony Adams out - reportedly for a month - and with a fresh-smelling work permit arriving at Highbury this very morning, Stepanovs looks likely to be hurled into the lions' den (well, Stamford Bridge). Not that Johnson, Stepanov's one-man fan club, is worried. \"I have told him if he plays like he did against Scotland in the Premiership he will soon be a millionaire in England,\" he twittered. But what will Stepanovs do with the money? Buy Lee Dixon's thigh muscles, we would wager.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NOT-SO CLEVER TREVOR</strong></p> <p>The Fiver loves the Sunday papers.

Sullivan told the Birmingham Sunday Mercury that Francis should stop talking like that, if he doesn't want to be forced out of the club. \"I would describe Trevor's reaction as paranoia,\" Sullivan said. \"His nature is one of pessimism. He paints a gloomy picture and has a policy of talking the team down. That way if we do badly he can say 'I told you so'. But if we do well he can tell us all what a wonderful manager he is.\"</p> <p>Francis, when not making Richard Keys look like an erudite afficionado of the game, has over the course of the past four seasons used porn magnate Sullivan's millions to steer the Blues away from promotion and acquire a complete collection of Mediocre Players \u0099. Not that Sullivan believes Francis would cut it even if he did make it to the Premiership. \"The task of staying there would be phenomenal and he might say 'I don't need this in my life',\" Sullivan said.

  "Today, in Downing Street, Prime Minister Tony Blair will meet the widow of a 1989 murder victim. <p>Geraldine Finucane will have finally made it to the heart of the government she believes played a part in her husband's assassination.</p> <p>Mr Blair will require more than his famous charm and caring ear to assuage the widow of Pat Finucane. </p> <p>The story begins three weeks before the Belfast solicitor was shot 14 times by members of the Ulster Freedom Fighters. The murder gang knocked down Finucane's front door in his north Belfast home as the family sat down for Sunday dinner.</p> <p>Geraldine Finucane was shot in the foot as she tried to protect their three children.</p> <p>An RUC detective investigating the killing described it at the time as \"the most ferocious murder I have come across. Every shot seemed to strike home and I believe the gunmen involved had murdered before.\"</p> <p>An immediate question that arose from the killing came from a statement made in the House of Commons three weeks before the killing.</p> <p>A Junior Home Office Minister, Douglas Hogg, told the House of Commons \"that there are in Northern Ireland a number of solicitors who are unduly sympathetic to the cause of the IRA.\"</p> <p>Hogg's comments were immediately condemned by the SDLP MP Seamus Mallon, who said that \"it would be on the Minister's head, and on the heads of the government, if an assasin's bullet did what his words had done.\"</p> <p>The NI Law Society accused Hogg of creating \"an excuse for terrorist organisations to carry out murders - something which was not available to them before.\"</p> <p>Then other strange things began to emerge. In 1992, the BBC Panorama programme broadcast allegations that the UDA were plotting to kill Finucane and that British Army Intelligence were warned in advance.</p> <p>The allegations came from Brian Nelson, who was, as well as a spook for the FRU (Forces Reconnaisance Unit), the Intelligence Officer for the UDA in West Belfast. </p> <p>Further allegations were made claiming that loyalist suspects under interrogation in Castlereagh Holding Centre were told by RUC Special Branch Officers that Finucane and two other nationalist solicitors were senior figures in the IRA.</p> <p>The UDA statement that claimed responsibility for the killing alleged that Finucane was \"killed as an IRA officer and not as a solicitor.\"</p> <p>In recent months, it has become clear that the RUC may well have more to reveal about the killing. William Stobie was arrested last year and charged with the killing, although, last week, the charges against him were reduced to \"aiding and abetting\" the shooting.</p> <p>In 1989, Stobie was quartermaster of the West Belfast UDA. We now know that he was also an RUC Special Branch informant.</p> <p>In the Sunday Tribune newspaper, he claimed that his RUC handlers had been tipped-off that Finucane was the target.</p> <p>Then, on the day of the killing itself, Stobie contacted his handlers and informed them that he had supplied weapons for a killing that would take place later that day. </p> <p>Over the years a momentum has built up, backing the calls of Geraldine Finucane for an independent judicial inquiry into the killing of her husband.</p> <p>The call has been supported by human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.</p> <p>The UN Human Rights Commission joined the chorus after a scathing report on the killing was compiled by leading Malaysian jurist Param Cumaraswamy, who concluded his report by writing \"so long as this murder is unresolved, many in the community will continue to lack confidence in the ability of the government to dispense justice in a fair and equitable manner.\"</p> <p>Last year, again on Panorama, Cumaraswamy claimed that the present RUC Chief Constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan told him that there were lawyers who were involved with paramilitary organisations. </p> <p>At first, Flanagan denied the allegation, but was publicly embarrassed when the BBC programme showed him minutes of his meeting with Cumaraswamy that Flanagan's office had subsequently approved and that showed such a conversation had taken place. </p> <p>Within months of the conversation between Cumaraswamy and Flanagan, an event occurred which made the Finucane allegations suddenly very relevant. </p> <p>Another leading nationalist solicitor was assassinated, again after receiving alleged threats from the security forces.</p> <p>Indeed, in an added, the week before Rosemary Nelson was blown up outside her home in Lurgan, a newspaper advertisement appeared calling for an independent inquiry into the Finucane shooting, signed by over 400 Irish and international legal figures.</p> <p>Soon after the then Secretary of State Mo Mowlam met with Geraldine Finucane, and received \"new evidence,\" which Finucane's widow believes are grounds for a new inquiry.</p> <p>Since then, she has met and received the backing of the Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.</p> <p>If today she convinces Tony Blair that there are grounds for a full inquiry, on top of the re-opened criminal investigation which saw Stobie's arrest last year and was headed by the recently appointed head of the Metropolitan Police John Stevens, it could open an almighty can of worms. </p> <p>The following questions are some that require convincing answers. How did Douglas Hogg feel secure in making his comments to the House of Commons three weeks before Finucane's assassination?</p> <p>Is it true, as claimed, that Hogg was briefed by RUC Special Branch officers days before his Commons statement?</p> <p>Why did army intelligence not act on the warnings by Brian Nelson that Finucane's life was in danger? Why did RUC Special Branch not act on similar warnings from William Stobie?</p> <p>Were UFF/UDA suspects told that people like Finucane should be targeted rather than the random Catholics who made up the bulk of loyalist victims during the murder campaign of the time?</p> <p>What did MI5 know? If the intelligence services were informed, how high did this information go? The go-ahead for the killing of three IRA members in Gibraltar the previous year went as far as the prime minister's office.</p> <p>Is it possible that intelligence reports from different agencies of the security forces stopped at a very low level in Northern Ireland?</p> <p>Finally, if another solicitor could die in similarly suspicious circumstances almost exactly 10 years later, what does that say about how certain figures at the heart of the security establishment regard defence solicitors who happen to be good at their jobs?</p>",
  "<p> \"I 'm a Sinatra man,\" says Michael Parkinson proudly when I ask him how he felt interviewing Victoria Beckham. He is explaining that he doesn't necessarily have a large stockpile of Spice Girls records, and that, frankly, he doesn't care. Parky is at that happy age where he doesn't have to fret about appearing fashionable. </p> <p>A quick look at the guest list for his new chat show series, starting on Friday, emphasises the point: Andrew Lloyd Webber, Julie Walters, Mark Knopfler, Mike Reid, Robson Green. People with a bit of hinterland, and with in some cases a past that might be brighter than their present. Fame is fickle, but Parkinson's admiration isn't. </p> <p>\"I don't like people who, in my judgment, are chancers,\" says Parkinson. \"I have to think that the reason a guest is on the show is that he's bloody good at what he does. My attitude towards people coming on the show is not 'Do I like them?' but 'Do I admire them?' \" </p> <p>I meet Parkinson at a favourite restaurant of his in Mayfair - quiet, friendly, dignified and ever so slightly old world. My opening line is the predictable one - my terror at interviewing the supreme interviewer. \"That's bollocks,\" he says. \"I'm not bad at what I do. But it's a certain area of interviewing. People tend to lump all interviewers together, but that's unfair. I can't do what Paxman does, or what Robin Day did. I'm not made that way.\" </p> <p>Parkinson once said his aim was to let his guests \"give the best of themselves to his audience\". A rather peculiar aim, I suggest. Shouldn't he be trying to find out what makes them tick, expose the private person behind the public face? \"The people I interview are not war criminals,\" he says. \"The only thing they've ever done, generally speaking, is entertain people. What's interesting is to find out why and how. </p> <p>\"A situation has developed where an interview isn't an interview unless there's blood on the carpet. I'd make a fool of myself if I tried to do that, and I don't see why the people who sit opposite me deserve that kind of treatment. The thing that I was most afraid of coming back was that that particular aspect of television had changed and that my show might seem very old-fashioned. It might look that way still, but the fact of the matter is there was an audience who wanted that.\" </p> <p>What Parkinson calls his \"second coming\" occurred in 1998, when - older, wiser and a good deal greyer - he returned to BBC1 16 years after his original, much-loved, much-feted chat show ended. It was, as he admits, a huge risk. \"I would have hated to come back and do a bad show that was badly received and made me skulk away thinking, 'Christ, I wish I'd never done that.' It was nice to come back and do a good show. That's what pleases me professionally. Reactions have been better than I could ever have imagined.\" </p> <p>It was typical of Parkinson that, despite 16 years away, nothing much had changed: the furniture looked the same; the stairs were still there; even the Harry Stoneham Five, whose music had seemed dated back in the early 80s, were still swinging. Only the guests were different, because the generation of Hollywood stars he had brilliantly caught at the end of their careers in the 70s were dying out. Cagney, Astaire, Crosby, Matthau, Niven - his cast list was remarkable and the resulting interviews legendary. </p> <p>Parkinson, who is now 65, recognises that the old order has changed. \"That great swathe of Hollywood film stars who were brought up through the studio system has gone, and they've not been replaced because what created them has gone as well. They'd also been through a war, those men and women, so they had a dimension which is more than being an actor; they weren't as blown away by their fame as some are today. The other thing that has changed is the power of the agent: there is far more undergrowth to get through.\" </p> <p>But he rejects the argument that there are no decent guests any more, and cites Paul McCartney (\"I'd been chasing him for 25 years\") and Woody Allen (\"I admire him inordinately\") as examples of recent interviewees who could be mentioned in the same breath as some of the ancients. </p> <p>But Ali, there'll never be another Ali, I say weepily. Parkinson becomes animated. \"Tiger Woods, he's Ali isn't he? In my lifetime I've seen two of the greatest ever superstars in sport: Ali was the first; this guy is the second. He's sensational. I'd love to do him.\" </p> <p>I had assumed that the guests for the entire series were already mapped out, but Parkinson and his team keep it flexible and like to strike the moment. \"We don't plan that far ahead. We've got enough to do the first three or four shows. It's not so much a question of getting one guest; it's a question of fitting three guests into a show. That's the fascination of the job. Any silly bugger can book one person and just stick two other people with them. The trick is to think about the combination. The difference between my show and others is that we have that conversational arena - three people who have to talk or we all look like idiots.\" </p> <p>The show is recorded the night before transmission and is only lightly edited. \"I shoot to time. I'm very old-fashioned about things like that because that's the background I came up in. I started in live television, so I just do it as live. I believe that if you over-record, it shows. The continuity is difficult: people age before your eyes. It's sloppy, awful.\" </p> <p>But there must be times when it goes wrong, when guests dry up or give monosyllabic answers and you are left babbling into endless silences? \"It's up to you to make it work. It doesn't not work too often, and it will only happen for two reasons - they're pissed or they're frightened. There's no cure for the former condition, as I know to my cost, but with the latter you can settle people down and take a bit longer to get them going. Then subtly edit: those will be the times that we go over, when the person doesn't respond immediately. And if it doesn't work at all, you have to be fatalistic about it - you can't win them all.\" </p> <p>Doesn't he sometimes wish he could entertain less and probe more? \"It's not In the Psychiatrist's Chair, but there's more than one way of skinning a rabbit. Once in an interview you have the person opposite you - in a totally phoney situation, which is television - trusting you. Then you can ask them anything you want. I asked Woody Allen about marrying his step-daughter, which was a fair question. It was a legitimate line of enquiry. He objected to it and said I was being voyeuristic, but I said no I'm not, this has had an effect on your career. I wasn't the slightest bit embarrassed by it, but I would have been if there hadn't been a point to it. It did affect his career - in Middle America it had an effect - and it was a legitimate question to ask.\" </p> <p>Parkinson admires his guests, is perhaps occasionally in awe of them, but he is never intimidated by them. \"I'm the boss, not them. It's my patch, not theirs. This is my home. That's why we never take the show on the road. They've got to come down my stairs into my living room and talk to me.\" </p> <p>He abandoned that cosy living room for the harsh commercial world in 1982, when he and fellow broadcasting luminaries David Frost, Anna Ford, Angela Rippon and Robert Kee set up TV-am. They won the ITV morning franchise, but then lost control of the company in a bitter boardroom battle. \"We did the difficult thing against the strongest group of bidders there has ever been,\" he says, \"but then we lost the bloody thing.\" </p> <p>Parkinson then did Desert Island Discs for 18 months, but had a well-publicised falling out with Roy Plomley's widow and left the programme. \"Mrs Plomley decided that I was a rough country boy with a terrible accent who shouldn't be allowed anyway near her husband's programme,\" he says with undisguised bitterness. </p> <p> It was not a happy period for Parkinson, compounded by the fact that he started drinking heavily, but he emphasises that he never stopped working - or earning. \"I was treading water but I didn't go under. I kept on working. I did lots of jobs, some of which I'm not particularly pleased to see on my CV, but on the other hand I'm delighted that I kept working. The most profitable year I had was two years after I'd left the BBC and TV-am, and nobody knew I was even on television. I was doing all kinds of crap, but it was highly paid crap, and I was rather proud of that.\" </p> <p>For all that, he certainly wasn't happy - and the drinking was an expression of his disillusionment. \"It was a phase I went through and I can look back at it now and see all the reasons why it happened - TV-am had gone, mid-life crisis, all that crap.\" He still likes a drink but it is now firmly under control. \"I couldn't work like I do now if I was drinking too much.\" </p> <p>Parkinson is known principally for his TV work - not just his show but his high-profile anchorman roles. He was the only cool head amid the wreckage of the BBC's millennium coverage, and in a couple of weeks will pop up as host (the word fits him like a glove) of A Night of 1,000 Shows, a celebration of the 40th anniversary of BBC Television Centre. Yet he sees himself principally as a journalist - he writes a weekly sports column for the Daily Telegraph - and reckons that gives him a substance that today's generation of TV presenters lack. </p> <p>\"I've always been a print journalist and I could make a living as a print journalist, so I've never had that fear about what would happen if TV didn't come calling. That's terribly important. If they said tomorrow 'We never want to see your face on television again', it wouldn't matter a damn. I could still make a living and I'd probably write a book about how crazy they all were on TV, all my secrets. </p> <p>\"In the early days of TV, presenters were recruited from journalism: we'd had a life outside television and we brought to television an approach to whatever we did that was journalistic. Now anybody is a celebrity, anybody is a presenter. Where do they come from? What are they? They don't know themselves, poor buggers. They are put on by cynical producers and away they go. The tabloids pick them up and producers say 'What shall we do with them? I know, give them a talk show; it's easy, a talk show.' But it's not easy, as people have demonstrated for many years. Why is Boot Hill so full of these people?\" </p> <p>Parkinson is a survivor. His show has survived. His marriage, to teacher-turned-broadcaster Mary, has survived. His popularity has survived the shifts in public taste. He has never tried to change and probably wouldn't know how: he is a pretty unreconstructed northern male of a certain vintage who has no truck with political correctness and thinks Bernard Manning is uproariously funny. His attitudes seem out of place in our happy-clappy, all-inclusive, trans-gender times, yet he remains a star, the bedrock of the Beeb. How does he do it? </p> <p>\"I've always taken the view that you should keep on working. I've worked for every newspaper in the business; I've also worked for most television and radio stations. My view is don't be posh about it, keep working, because in the end things will work out. It's the Michael Caine view of film-making: there'll be a lot of rubbish but one or two things will remind you what you came into the business for. </p> <p>\"If you've got any sense, you are what you area: you're still the person from where you came. The great problem with celebrity is that it can change you, but fortunately it happened to me when I was a mature man. I was 35 and had had a career in Fleet Street and as a producer, so I understood what was happening. If it had happened to me when I was 21, I don't think you'd be interviewing me today.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act is due to become law in October. A consultation period to fix regulations which outline the circumstances under which businesses can lawfully intercept employees' communications was to expire at the end of August, but has now been extended to September 15 at the insistence of industry, which wants more powers. </p> <p>What is being proposed? A 1997 European Directive requires states to protect the confidentiality of communications - that is, phone calls, faxes and emails - although there is scope for interception, to provide \"evidence of a commercial transaction\", for example. </p> <p>The RIP Act, which already permits the government and other authorities (police, security services) to monitor email, allows the interception of emails by employers in situations where they believe that both sender and recipient have given their consent. But the draft regulations would go a step further, to authorise monitoring or recording of emails and phone calls without consent for specific reasons, such as a suspicion of \"unauthorised use\". </p> <p>Industry pressure groups argue that they should be able to monitor employees' emails without consent.

  "<p>The International Monetary Fund and the other institutions in charge of the global economy are \"fossils from a pre-democratic era\" and have sidelined the United Nations, according to a new report published today on the eve of a key summit on the UN's future. </p> <p>Global economic problems, like the financial crisis which rocked Asia three years ago and the failure to deal with poverty are the result of a huge democratic deficit in the world economy, according to the New Economics Foundation.</p> <p>The world's seven leading industrialised economies control almost half the votes on the IMF's board because they are its biggest shareholders, a division of power which NEF describes as corruption at the highest level.</p> <p>\"If you tried to buy votes in a national election it would be gerrymandering and you could go to prison,\" said Andrew Simms, co-author of the report and head of the global economy programme at NEF. \"But buying votes at the World Bank and IMF is considered a virtue.\" The economies of most developing countries are effectively run by the IMF - as a condition of its lending programme it requires countries to stick to a detailed programme of economic policies - yet the developing world controls just over a third of votes on the IMF's board.</p> <p>\"They are 17th-century parodies of representative government,\" the report says, \"from a time that recognised only the rights of aristocrats and big landowners.\"</p> <p>The UN, the most democratic institution in the global system, has been squeezed out of its original mission to balance the interests of rich and poor countries by the IMF and the World Bank, according to NEF.</p> <p>The solution is for the Bank and the IMF to apply the same requirements of democracy and accountability they expect from developing countries to their own organisations.</p> <p>\"We have to end the minority rule of the global economy by an aristocratic economic elite,\" said Mr Simms.</p>",
  "Government troops have launched a massive attack on Tamil rebels in the northern Jaffna Peninsula, which has left at least 316 dead on both sides, military officials and rebels said today. <p>Another 779 soldiers were wounded in the fighting that began yesterday. Sporadic artillery attacks continue. </p> <p>\"The aim behind our operation ... is to regain areas that we had lost to the terrorists and also to create a bigger buffer zone to protect the city of Jaffna,\" military spokesman Brig. Sanath Karunaratne told The Associated Press. </p> <p>\"Though we have lost 100 men in Sunday's fighting, we now control a greater area and the city of Jaffna will be safe from any terrorist attack in the future,\" he said. </p> <p>At least eight army officers and 92 government soldiers were killed and 479 soldiers were wounded, Karunaratne said. </p> <p>The Tamil Tigers said they successfully resisted the attack, but did not give their casualties. Karunaratne claimed rebel radio transmissions, intercepted by military intelligence confirmed 216 rebels dead and another 300 wounded. </p> <p>The military launched the offensive to boost its defence of Jaffna, the former rebel capital that came under government control in 1996. The guerrillas have been trying to recapture Jaffna since April. </p> <p>\"Facing superior fire power from land and from air, the LTTE combat formations are putting up fierce resistance inflicting heavy casualties on the government troops,\" the rebel statement said. </p> <p>Sunday's battle, the fiercest since April, forced thousands of civilians to flee their homes to escape artillery fire, rebel sources said. </p> <p>The renewed thrust by government troops broke a four-month lull in fighting on the peninsula. The rebels fired mortars last week at government defences in Meesalai, 12 miles east of Jaffna city. </p> <p>No independent confirmation is possible, as journalists are not permitted in the war zone.

  "<p>Peter Salmon confessed to friends last week that he'd had a \"terrible Edinburgh\". Even before the annual television industry love-in, the BBC1 controller knew that his time was up. Nothing was said publicly, but it did not take everyone else long to work it out for themselves. </p> <p>The evidence was all there. First, in his MacTaggart lecture, director-general Greg Dyke laid into BBC1, saying it simply had to do better. Then, the following day, he attacked the use of soap stars in poor TV dramas (think Harbour Lights and Sunburn) and called time on tired old docusoaps. Next, it was his trusted lieutenant Mark Thompson, and not Salmon, who fielded questions about how BBC1 would take shape after the Nine O'Clock News is moved to 10pm. Finally, Salmon pulled out of a seminar on TV drama, at which he was to be a panelist. </p> <p>Whispers soon made it into print: both the Daily Mail and the Guardian ran stories saying Salmon's reign was over. There were no denials from the BBC, and the controller hurried back from a brief post-festival Scottish tour - he had gone to check out filming of Monarch of the Glen and Castaway - for a series of meetings with his bosses in London. It is not a question of if, but when - and it is certain that he'll be off to another top BBC job before the month is out. </p> <p>Whoever succeeds Salmon as head of the prime public service channel on British television will be taking on a task that will either be the pinnacle of their career, or turn them into a nervous wreck. </p> <p>The controller of BBC1 has the hardest task in television: balancing the BBC's public service obligation with the drive for high ratings. Some would argue that without a mass-appeal channel, the justification for the licence fee goes out of the window and the future of the entire organisation as it is currently constituted is undermined. </p> <p>It's not a new phenomenon: Bill Cotton, the legendary former managing director of BBC Television and BBC1 controller between 1977 and 1981, says it was ever thus. \"BBC1 has always been a vital part of the BBC's claim to a licence fee. One liked to think it was the quintessential part of the BBC, that tried to do the best of everything for everybody.\" The only difference is that for Cotton, there was only one enemy - ITV - now, in the digital age, there are dozens. </p> <p>Jonathan Powell, BBC1 controller between 1987 and 1992 and now head of drama at Carlton, agrees. \"You live and die by the ratings. That's what every controller of BBC1 has always known.\" It is an almost impossible task, carrying the torch for public service broadcasting while attempting to avoid being walked all over by the opposition, he says. \"That's why it's so difficult.\" </p> <p>Dyke's task is to arrest the decline at BBC1 and boost its share in relation to its main rivals. Indeed, some suggest privately that, at the end of his term, Dyke wants to be able to claim that BBC1 is more popular than ITV. If he achieves this aim, he will be credited as the saviour of the corporation. </p> <p>The standard Salmon defence is that he has done a \"fantastic job at the most difficult time\". There was no money available to invest in popular drama, the broadcast and production divisions were split, leaving him without a support structure, and yet he pulled off successes like Walking With Dinosaurs, Warriors and the Royle Family. He saw off Noel Edmonds, became the first BBC1 controller forced to schedule against the FA Cup, and with new investment has laid the foundations for his successor. </p> <p>The case for the prosecution is that Dinosaurs wasn't his commission, Warriors was a one-off, and the Royle Family can hardly be claimed by the BBC, since it is made by Granada. On top of that, there is no new returning drama to speak of. Casualty and EastEnders were all on the scene before he came along, Holby City was already in the pipeline and the jury is still out on Monarch of the Glen. </p> <p>\"You can't say it's all Salmon's fault. John Birt has a lot to answer for,\" says Powell. \"Nobody would have succeeded under John Birt's regime. He was responsible for reducing costs so far that people had nowhere to go. That's why Peter was forced into relying on documentary soaps, they were cheap and they were the only thing he could do.\" </p> <p>Michael Jackson, chief executive of Channel 4 and BBC1 controller between 1996 and 1997, agrees it was hard for Salmon. \"The BBC collectively asked him to be distinctive, and at the same time get a 30% share. That was impossible.\" </p> <p>But could he have succeeded had the dead hand of Birt not lingered above? The Salmon regime is littered with battles he should have won, but which he lost. When the BBC was agonising over the relaunch of the Six O'Clock News, Salmon wanted Jill Dando to anchor it. He was right: she was by far the most popular BBC presenter. But Tony Hall, the head of news, preferred political correspondent Huw Edwards, and Salmon lost. He wanted rid of Panorama: it's still there, a black hole in his weekly schedule. He wanted \u00a3100m more to invest in popular drama: he's got it now, but he's not going to be spending it. </p> <p>Despite her lack of drama experience, the cheques will almost certainly be signed off by Lorraine Heggessey - currently joint director of factual and learning - as long as the unfeasibly complex drama commissioning structure proposed by Thompson is sorted out. As Cotton says when asked how he ensured the return of dozens of popular series: \"You had a good head of drama and that was his job.\" </p> <p>At the moment, the BBC doesn't really have a head of drama. There's Jane Tranter, head of drama serials, and Mal Young, head of drama series. They are the Upstairs, Downstairs of BBC drama - she muses over Wives and Daughters and Other People's Children, while he gets his hands dirty with Casualty and Holby City. Soon there will be Simon Lewis and Sue Hogg from Granada, installed as executive producers in a new unit reporting to drama and entertainment supremo Alan Yentob. </p> <p>But are these really the right people? Lewis and Hogg were unpopular figures at Granada. It is understood that Granada's programming director Grant Mansfield got so fed up with their prevarication that he told them both to \"shove off\" to the BBC if they really wanted to. Granada is now looking forward to restructuring its drama department without them. </p> <p>Crucially, ITV's revered drama controller Nick Elliott doesn't seem to be in too much of a hurry to give up his network centre kingdom, despite desperate attempts by the BBC to get him. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it is clear that the lion's share of the \u00a395m of new money earmarked by Dyke for BBC1 is going on popular drama. At BBC Elstree this week, 30 new episodes of Holby City, the Casualty spin-off, are in production. That's twice last year's run, and takes it to Peak Practice proportions, becoming almost a year-round feature of our screens. The show will gain a new children's ward, allowing writers to diversify from heart surgery to saving babies (remember the audience demographics: at 8pm, it's mums, teens and kids after EastEnders). </p> <p>Talking of which, the soap has just introduced a new family to the Square, whose five mouthy daughters will provide a raft of new storylines. That long-promised fourth episode is now certain, and if the BBC has any sense it will play it on Sunday nights, its weak point, giving Heartbeat a serious run for its money and teeing up the audience for the later-night offerings. And in Birmingham, producers are labouring on an order for 100 new half-hours of Doctors, the successful daytime soap set in a Midlands surgery. </p> <p>Series such as Holby are what the BBC really needs, the fresh but reliable mid-week regular drama that ITV is best at. As Dyke said in his MacTaggart: \"It's the programmes, stupid\". </p> <p>Young, perched in a hospital chair on the Holby set, underscores its significance. This is the first successful new BBC1 one-hour drama format and it has risen above the very public failures of Harbour Lights and Sunburn - slapped down by Dyke in Edinburgh for relying on ex-soap stars. The man who once vowed he would use former soap stars above all others is repentant. \"We're all guilty of grabbing a face, but it's a short-term gimmick. Viewers see right through it. It's the scripts that count. On the other hand, the soaps are so prevalent it's hard to find someone who hasn't been in one,\" says Young equably. </p> <p>Salmon remarked at Edinburgh, perhaps prophetically, that BBC1 can be a very cold place. He meant that there would have to be more collaboration, between the network of five new channels sketched out by Dyke, so promising ideas can migrate across. </p> <p> However, in the short term, the stockpiling for next year's schedule blitz started under him six months ago, as the shift in 9pm news was anticipated. The build up in production has been aided, confirms Dyke, by a cache of \u00a3200m, amassed by prudent BBC accountants, before the improved licence fee settlement was struck last January. </p> <p>So, there are three more Scarlet Pimpernels, starring Richard E Grant. Martin Shaw, a hit in ITV's rival hospital drama, Always and Everyone, has been wooed to star in Judge John Dee, a series about an unconventional judge, written by GF Newman (Law and Order). And Stephen Tompkinson is being paired with Nick Berry for In Deep, an undercover cop show, for post watershed. It could become the regular police drama that the BBC so badly needs. </p> <p>BBC1 is investing in Steven Spielberg's 10-part Band of Brothers, about a group of American soldiers in the second world war, a spin-off from Saving Private Ryan, currently in production in Hertfordshire. </p> <p>It's clear, then, that Dyke has signed up BBC1 to the Bill Cotton rule of \"being the best of everyone for everybody\". The question is, whether he's got the right idea. Is there enough talent simply to make all these programmes? Jackson thinks not. \"That's a huge undertaking and it's a waste of time. You just need to make sure that BBC1 is out there, making a few big hits that make people say 'thank God for the BBC'. Anything else is just too difficult.\" </p> <p><strong>ITV is in trouble too</strong><br>by David Elstein</p> <p>Why does it matter where the BBC places its main evening news bulletin? Before Greg Dyke labels me as one of the \"retired old men of the BBC\" defending yesterday (yes, I did work there until 35 years ago), I do not believe 9pm is sacrosanct or 10pm impermissible. But I do believe in being honest with the public. </p> <p>The argument based on Commons votes or US markets closing is simply laughable. Dyke himself scoffed at it while making the case for moving News at Ten to Gerald Kaufman's Commons committee when he was ITV's council chairman. Very few Commons votes feature in the news, let alone those at 10pm. The US markets have all but closed when the present 9pm bulletin ends, and virtually never merit more than a glancing mention. </p> <p>But \"the main reason\" for the move, according to Dyke, is that more people will watch news in the later slot. That is barely credible. There are far fewer people available to view television at 10pm than 9pm. A later bulletin might - \"might!\" - just win a larger share of available viewers, but that \"more people will watch it\" is a pledge almost impossible to fulfil. Will the governors require a return to 9pm if the ploy fails? Don't hold your breath. </p> <p>Dyke made much of the claim that \"currently in digital homes, audience share for the Nine O'Clock News often falls below 10%\". In fact, after under-performing against the rest of the schedule for the first six months of the year in digital satellite homes, the Nine O'Clock News has since equalled or out-performed BBC1 as a whole in these homes, based on the relative share of viewing compared with total viewing. </p> <p>In any case, there is absolutely no evidence that news will perform any better relatively in digital homes at 10pm than at 9pm. And we have heard before all these improbable protestations about enlarging the news audience by moving the bulletin later - from the ITV companies. Nobody (except, perhaps, an over-credulous ITC) believed them: but then the transparent motive for the move was to increase audience share in the vacated slot. </p> <p>Increasing BBC1's audience share at 9pm is evidently the true motive for moving the news, and Greg should have been much more straightforward about it. After all, it is all part of the pressure that licence-fee funding places on the BBC. You cannot afford to let the audience share for your main channel drop to the point where licence-fee payers feel short-changed, and evasion starts to rise again. </p> <p>Of course, what takes the 9pm slot remains a crucial issue. First, will it drive up audience share? The evidence from the run of failed dramas at 9.30pm recently would suggest that the BBC simply lacks the fire power to compete at 9pm, unless there is to be a shift to much more populist programming. That in turn raises the issue of why a publicly-funded broadcaster should deliberately reduce the news audience in peak-time (as seems inevitable) in favour of increasing consumption of soft factual material or entertainment. A major dent in the BBC's reputation for public service broadcasting seems a high price to pay for putting a minor blip in the ratings decline of BBC1. </p> <p>Whether Lorraine Heggessey (if it is to be her) can achieve what eluded Peter Salmon must be doubtful. Three years of navigating the BBC's frustrating system seems to have crushed some of Salmon's natural flair: at Edinburgh, he made a woeful hash of the ITV line-up in the scheduling game, putting both a 90-minute Bill and Burnside into peak-time, while BBC exile Michael Attwell showed how a competitive BBC1 schedule could be assembled. Heggessey - whom I have known since she was a student - is an energetic go-getter, but she (like Salmon) will lack the full control of the channel budget and commissioning process that is so essential in a competitive environment. </p> <p>In any event, the downward trend for the two main channels seems inexorable. In 1989, ITV and BBC1 captured 80% of all viewers. In 1995, 70%. In 1999, just under 60%. So far this year, 56.5%. For the last month, less than 53%. In multi-channel homes in July, they shared barely 40% of the audience, for the first time less than all satellite channels combined. If anything, BBC1's plight has only served to conceal ITV's dismal performance, not just across the day, but even within its own carefully defined version of peak-time, where it will fail by a wide margin even to meet the target it so recently revised sharply downward. Of course, ITV's concentration of ownership allows it to secure a disproportionate amount of the advertising market, despite audience erosion. The licence fee is not like that. Dyke (and Heggessey) may find that the news manoeuvre backfires. A further audience decline, embracing an even sharper news audience decline, would leave a lot of questions to be answered at Edinburgh next year.</p>",

Given the nascent state of Wap services, it's difficult to find any distinguishing features between the various portals. What will happen, however, is the portals will make more of an effort to sign up exclusive content that make them stand head and shoulders above the competition. Orange has already done this with ITN, but is that really a strong enough reason to buy an Orange phone over and above a Vodafone phone? The now defunct BBC Wap service, which was heads and shoulders above the competition, is about to sign long-term deals with Vodafone and BT Cellnet so that they can offer BBC news on their Wap portals - for a price.

  "<p>For the woman who wants to leave her good-for-nothing man but does not quite know how, there will soon be a glossy magazine with handy hints. </p> <p>New Era is launched next month by publishers who have spotted a gap in the market. While there are plenty of titles to help you get hitched, there is nothing for when things come unstuck. </p> <p>With a print run of 100,000, a celebrity divorcee on the cover of each issue and a column by one of the lawyers involved in the divorce of Diana, Princess of Wales, the 116-page bi-monthly magazine is aiming for big sales. </p> <p>Lesley Neil, its editor and a divorcee, said the magazine would begin where other women's titles end: at the altar. </p> <p>It will provide serious features on the financial implications of splitting up and advice on how to break the news to children. </p> <p>But there would be a positive side too, said Ms Neil. \"New Era is essentially upbeat. We'll be giving people the confidence to handle their first date as a newly single person and showing them the best way to meet a new partner. Divorce is a time for change, and we intend to approach it in a positive way to show there is life after marriage.\" </p> <p>David Cordrey, the publishing director, said research had shown that women turned to their usual general interest magazines for help at the time of divorce but found nothing geared to their needs. \"They are hungry for information about their legal and financial rights and also for emotional support. There is no one source of information that covers all those issues.\" </p> <p>He said the magazine would draw on the advice of a panel of experts, including Peter Watson-Lee, vice chairman of the Law Society's family law committee, a psychologist, a child psychologist and a financial adviser. Sandra Davis of the law firm Mischon de Reya, who worked with Anthony Julius, the lead lawyer in Princess Diana's divorce, will also contribute. </p> <p>\"Divorce is one of the few times in your life when you realise your assets, such as insurance policies, property and so on,\" said Mr Cordrey. </p> <p>But New Era would also be entertaining, featuring women who had undergone big image changes after a divorce, such as Margaret Cook, former wife of the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and Julia Carling, the ex of the former England rugby union captain Will Carling.</p>",

  "<p>The poor old euro cuts a sorry figure as it stumbles around the foreign exchanges. Interest rates have risen five times already this year, and will rise again during the autumn, but still investors would prefer to hold US dollars than the single currency. The European Central Bank appears to be at its wits' end, with one half of the markets decrying last week's move as too aggressive and the other half arguing that it was not aggressive enough. </p> <p>With Germany and France showing the first signs of slowing down while inflation in Ireland is out of control, the strains in monetary union are showing for the first time since the euro was launched 20 months ago. For months, Europe's central bankers and politicians have been saying that the euro is fundamentally undervalued and will soon deliver a knockout blow to the over-confident dollar. But, somehow, it never seems to happen. Capital is still flowing into the US and out of Europe, and it is this rather than the counterpart, Europe's trade surplus and America's trade deficit, that is affecting currency values. </p> <p>Two of the UK groups that oppose monetary union, Business for Sterling and New Europe, today launch a campaign designed to point out the benefits of staying out and the risks of going in, and they could hardly have picked a more propitious moment to do so. Talking up the euro hasn't worked, higher interest rates haven't worked, massive G7 intervention is not on the agenda because the Democrats are relying on the strong dollar to damp down US inflation, underpin share prices on Wall Street and ensure that the planned slowdown in American growth does not turn into a hard landing. </p> <p>So what is to be done? One long-term answer could be to put the euro out of its misery altogether and decide that monetary union in Europe is merely a stepping stone to global monetary union with the dollar as the single currency. Inadvertently perhaps, the justification for such a move was provided by a recent pamphlet produced by Britain in Europe, the lobby group that favours sterling's entry into the single currency. </p> <p>The report, quite fairly, does not pretend that euroland has a better job creation record than the UK (which it does not) and concedes that there are risks involved in both joining the euro and in staying out. But, interestingly, the reasons that it says tip the balance in its favour - the ability of businesses to sell more widely, achieving the \"massive economies of scale seen in America\", removing the barriers to trade represented by \"separate currencies\", limiting currency fluctuations, and having greater influence in decision-making would all seem to be arguments in favour of one world currency. </p> <p>If the name of the game is removing barriers then why stop at Europe? The inexorable logic of the BiE report is that making life easier for business will lead to higher growth and hence all of us will reap the trickle-down benefits of higher living standards. So, in classic Thatcherite fashion, the more barriers that can be removed the better, and given that more than 60% of world trade and inward investment are between North America, Western Europe and Japan, this ought to mean just one big currency. Indeed, two of the people responsible for the BiE paper, Robert Mundell and Willem Buiter, are supporters of a world currency. </p> <p>Would there be advantages to this, in addition to the obvious benefit to those in the euro zone of having Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve in charge of monetary policy rather than the hapless ECB? Well, it would put an end to currency speculation. Yoked together by a single currency, governments in the rich countries could settle their differences and push for a new trade round to remove any other barriers to business that threaten the ability of their multinationals to prise open new markets. </p> <p>Moreover, technically speaking, this would be the perfect moment to amalgamate the three major currencies into one. Give or take a few cents, one dollar buys one euro buys 100 yen. Rebase the yen so that 100 old yen equals one new yen and the three currencies would all trade at close to parity. </p> <p> Given the premise of the BiE paper, this makes as much sense as British membership of the euro, and is subject to the same two objections. The first is economic: the fact that the right monetary policy for the US at the present would certainly not be the right monetary policy for Japan, just as the monetary policy that is right for Germany is not right for Ireland. </p> <p><strong> Tower of Babel</strong><br> Had Britain joined monetary union in 1999 and cut interest rates to 3%, it is clear that inflation would now be well above its 2.5% target and the government would be under considerable pressure to tighten fiscal policy to counterbalance the monetary laxity. Ireland, with inflation above 6%, has negative real interest rates, which is totally inappropriate. </p> <p>The second is political: the reluctance of people to give up democratic rights even if that does involve accepting a degree of inefficiency. Europe is a case in point, here. All EU documents are published in 11 languages, and this requires non-stop work for 1,900 translators working in the appropriately named Tower of Babel in Brussels. In terms of economic efficiency, it would make far better sense to have one language. But were it to be said that Europe needed one language as well as one money there would be outrage, and rightly so. Language is not just about making money, but is a part of culture and an individual right. It cannot be bargained away to improve profitability. </p> <p>Inadvertently perhaps, the BiE report lets the cat out of the bag. Monetary union is not there to create a European redoubt against the Americanisation of the global economy, but to give succour to all those intent on dismantling the European social model. This is a problem for the Little Europeans who hope vainly that monetary union is a device for keeping the nasty Americans at bay, and see British entry into monetary union as the only way to safeguard Europe's identity. </p> <p>The government certainly does not see it this way. As far as can be determined from its delphic pronouncements, Labour is with the globalisers not the Uncle Sam bashers, buying the argument from its big business chums that monetary union will help to make Europe more dynamic (more profits for business) and flexible (fewer benefits for workers). Unfortunately, the government is allowed to get away with the pretence that there is something progressive about this because William Hague keeps insisting that monetary union is a socialist plot. If only. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "David Tinker, who has died aged 75, was one of the stars of the Welsh Group's 50th anniversary retrospective at the national museums and galleries of Wales. His work in that show seduced even those who had always thought themselves uninterested in op art. <p>In 1949, Tinker had arrived, as an enthusiastic young lecturer in sculpture, at Cardiff College of Art. Over the next half century, he became one of the most prominent figures in Welsh contemporary art. He led calls for modernism and abstraction to be taken seriously amid the provincial academicism that dominated not just public taste, but the Welsh galleries and art schools. </p> <p>In 1956, he was co-founder of the radical exhibiting co-operative 56 Group Wales. At the same time, he was pivotal in defeating the conservatism of the South Wales Group, blasting the \"closed shop operating against the experimental painter\". As chairman of the Welsh Group for 15 years, Tinker worked to create opportunities for artists, sometimes seeming high-minded in a way which belied his soft, self-effacing sense of humour. </p> <p>At Cardiff, his students had included Sir Anthony Hopkins and the painters Ivor Davies and Professor Glyn Jones. In 1962, he moved to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, leading its growing art school until his retirement in 1986. </p> <p>Tinker was born in Charlton, south London, the son of a naval engineer and an embroiderer. To this background he attributed his love of making things and his fascination with the visual. As he wrote in an essay for Artists In Wales (1977): \"The sight of colour, shape and form are marvellous to me. I have always felt I must communicate to other people something of the excitement which I experience.\" He was educated in Rochester, Portsmouth and Canterbury, and at Winchester and Bath schools of art. Wartime naval service followed, before he took up a place at the Slade school of art in 1946; negative experiences at the Slade shaped his most important precept, which was to attune himself to students' individualism, and never to \"correct\" them. </p> <p>When Tinker was a young lecturer, Reg Butler had advised him always to make time for his own creativity, however difficult it might be to do so. He worked continuously and was fascinated above all by colour, publishing a pamphlet, Colour Recognition, in 1982. In a series of op art paintings, he used systematic colour progressions, finely judged to hypnotic effect. He had 20 solo shows, but he was more committed to the democracy of the group show and of public art. </p> <p>One of his proudest projects was the vast mural that dominates the university arts centre at Aberystwyth, commissioned by the architect, Dale Owen. Stage design also allowed him to share his ideas with a wide audience, and he revelled in designing productions for Welsh National Opera and plays for Saunders Lewis. </p> <p>Tinker's later work appeared to grow from an abstract expressionist tradition, though he said recently that he realised he had been a romantic all along. This was particularly apparent, perhaps, in his last solo exhibition, Dream Places: this featured ceramic constructions in which strange architecture and disembodied facial features together conjured silent reveries. </p> <p>Tinker sat on the Welsh Arts Council's art panel and the executive of the Contemporary Art Society for Wales. Chairing the general arts lobby for Wales, he gave evidence to the recent National Assembly arts policy review, stressing the need for a gallery of modern art in Wales, the only nation of the British Isles that still does not have such a gallery. </p> <p>Examples of his work are held by the Arts Council of Wales and the National Gallery in Cardiff. He was awarded the Queen's Medal for Art in 1977. A retrospective of his work, in the plan ning of which he took much pleasure during his final illness, will be shown at Aberystwyth in 2001. </p> <p>He is survived by his three children from his first marriage, to Mary Edwards; and by his second wife, Tracy Spottiswoode. </p> <p>\u0095 David Tinker, artist, born December 4 1924; died August 25 2000</p>",
  "While making the classic horror movie, The Black Cat (1934), the director Edgar G Ulmer met his wife-to-be, Shirley Kassler, who has died aged 86. She was the script supervisor on the picture, and their collaboration lasted 40 years, during which she worked on all his scripts, although she received screenplay credits only on those from 1934-1940. <p>Kassler was born in New York, but went to California as a teenager after her banker-father was wiped out in the 1929 stock market crash. At the time of her meeting with Ulmer, she was married to Max Alexander, the nephew of Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios. Ulmer's wooing outraged \"Uncle Carl\" and Ulmer was blacklisted by the powerful Laemmle. Before leaving Hollywood, Ulmer directed one further feature, under the name of Joen Warner: a western, Thunder Over Texas (1934), written by Shirley, and produced by Max Alexander. </p> <p>Edgar and Shirley were married soon after. During the depression, with the movie studios closed to them, they moved to New York where she modelled hats, and he worked as a cameraman for Path\u00e9 Newsreel. In 1936, producer William Steiner hired them to make a thriller, From Nine To Nine, under Canada's \"quota quickie\" system; it was shot in eight days during a terrible Montreal winter. They were paid so little that Shirley's appendicitis, which felled her on the last day of shooting, wiped out their earnings and they returned to New York as broke as they had left it. </p> <p>Their salvation was a crazy Ukrainian, Vasile Avramenko, who wanted to make a Ukrainian musical, and hired Ulmer, with a $50 advance, to direct Natalka Poltavka (1937), shot for $18,000 in a Ukrainian village constructed overnight in the backwoods of New Jersey. </p> <p>While in New York, the Ulmers met several members of the Jewish Art Theatre, who encouraged them to make pictures in Yiddish for the large immigrant community, although the Ulmers didn't actually speak the language. The first, Green Fields, an adaptation from a stage success was made on a budget of only $8,000, and Ulmer, with his wife's help, proved that he could do more with less than any other director in America. Its success led to his direction of three more Yiddish films, The Singing Blacksmith, The Light Ahead and American Matchmaker. If Ulmer could lay claim to the title King of the Bs, then his wife was the B-movie queen. </p> <p>Between 1943 and 1946, at the Producers' Releasing Company, the smallest of the poverty row studios, Shirley worked on the scripts of 11 of Ulmer's good and bad films, among them Girls In Chains (set in a woman's prison), Her Sister's Secret (the secret being the taboo subject of illegitimacy), Jive Junction (a second world war propaganda musical), Strange Illusion (a film noir version of Hamlet), and an undisputed masterpiece, Detour (1946), a manic cinematic night ride, a fatalistic drama of sex and money. </p> <p>Ulmer said he preferred the budgetary restraints of the minor studios to the artistic restraints of the majors. As his wife commented: \"He didn't want to be connected with any boss or studio where he had to follow rules. When he made a picture, there was always something he had to say, a moral, a reason. So they were a lot more serious than the average inexpensive film.\" </p> <p>While Ulmer was flitting from one film to another, he was also shunting between his wife and daughter, and another partner, with whom he had a child, living as head of two families. Shirley bore this with fortitude. </p> <p>Though she continued to work with her husband, she also had another career as Shirley Castle, script supervisor for big league directors such as Frank Borzage, William Wyler and Douglas Sirk: in the same capacity, she worked on a number of TV series including The Lone Ranger and Batman, later co-writing a book, The Role Of Script Supervision In Film And Television. </p> <p>Shirley was at her husband's side during his last years. A series of strokes left him paralysed, unable to swallow, talk or move anything but the forefinger on his right hand, with which he communicated. As his wife said: \"This time it is truly his own nightmare that he endures.\" He died in 1972. </p> <p>When interest in Ulmer's films began in the 1970s and he gained cult status, Shirley Ulmer spoke at many tributes and retrospectives, and was director of the Edgar G Ulmer Preservation Corporation. Her daughter, Ariann\u00e9 Ulmer Cipes, carries on the corporation's work. </p> <p>\u0095 Shirley Kassler Ulmer, screenwriter and script supervisor, born June 12 1914; died July 6 2000</p>",
  "<p> Last week, at the University of Arkansas, a student commemorated the first day of term by shooting dead his English professor. It was a small news item from far away and got less coverage than the recent assault on a local English professor by a deranged student, convinced that the author of The Female Eunuch was her surrogate mum. Higher education gets a disproportionate share of crazies. Entrants are selected on one criterion only - exam grade. In the bad old days, when places at university were hard to come by, candidates were required to affirm they were in tip-top physical and mental shape before taking on the gruelling task of a degree course. </p> <p>Nowadays such questions are discriminatory and illegal. Nor would a referee dare write: \"This pupil is very clever - but extremely unstable.\" Many are. Universities have become sieves that exclude the dumb but not the mad. The asylums are empty, the quads are full of them. </p> <p>I suspect - on no scientific basis whatsoever - that cleverness and lunacy run together. \"Great wits,\" as the poet said, \"are to madness near allied.\" </p> <p>There is also something deeply contradictory in the teaching situation. Your friendly tutor during the term is - at the end of the year - your ruthless examiner. The department is, in its day-to-day dealings, artificially friendly (\"Would you like a glass of sherry, dear boy?\"), and then they crap on you with a C, or a lower second, or refer your thesis. Who is the real professor, the student wonders, fairy godmother or wicked stepmother? </p> <p>At any time in every department, some colleague will be the attention of a student who has flipped. One of my colleagues is being stalked at the moment. Mailboxes have just been moved around and I accidentally picked up something of his - a gigantic greeting card, covered with gibberish. Like two or three others in the department, my colleague is ex-directory. But letters and bulky little parcels with bizarre inscriptions appear in the office mail almost daily. Unless there are specific threats of violence, the police won't intervene. </p> <p>Another colleague, Karl Miller, wrote about being stalked in his autobiography. A student gone mad had delusions he was Karl Miller, and moved into a flat opposite his prey. Miller, whose particular interest was the doppelganger, took a wry intellectual interest in the episode. But it lasted years and must have been hell. I taught the student when he was still sane. Clever bloke. </p> <p>A few months ago, one of the most brilliant students our department has produced was wandering distractedly up and down the corridors. If she recognised you (as, unluckily, she did me) she'd plaintively tell you she was trapped in the internet, how could she get out? She had written to members of the cabinet, but they hadn't replied. She was living in a hostel, not taking her medication and may well, from some distracted remarks, have been raped. </p> <p>University authorities, who nowadays have regulations on every other damn thing, give no advice on what to do with students, or ex-students, who have lost it - beyond getting them off the premises. \"Move on,\" as Dickens put it. </p> <p> In America, stalkers and nutters tend to be vindictive and are more likely to be armed and violent. The Unabomber targeted scientific institutions whose faculty were warned not to open strange-looking packages. One poor sod did and had his hands blown off. </p> <p>I've known a couple of American students, disaffected with their grades, who've threatened to come back with guns and renegotiate. Every year some do just that. </p> <p>The coldest-blooded stalker I knew in the States was neither violent nor mad - just villainous in a Jacobean kind of way. His modus operandi was to seduce male teachers. If he succeeded, as he sometimes did, he'd write up the experience (\"blowing the prof\") in a student magazine, or just post it on some convenient wall. Naming names. One victim had an alcoholic breakdown. Shooting might have been kinder. </p> <p>Jimmy X (as I'll call him) tried it on me. \"I think you're cute,\" he said when I declined, hands over my privates like some coy Victorian maiden (I treasure the remark). Jimmy was genius-clever and great fun to teach, if you could keep his mouth off your Johnson. He sent me a letter the other day: he's making a fortune programming and on his third same-sex marriage. Jimmy still thinks I'm cute.</p>",
  "On his first day back after his holiday - France, then two weeks climbing in north Wales - Chris Woodhead apologises if he is not up on all the issues. <p>But even if Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools has barely time to catch breath before flying to Stockholm to address the Swedish CBI, his political antennae seem as well tuned as ever. To the accusation that Ofsted, the schools inspectorate for England, has disillusioned teachers, he says: \"I strongly believe that in the long term impact on morale has been positive.\" </p> <p>But the language of his and Ofsted's critics - \"witchfinder-general\" (Barry Sheerman, chairman of the Commons education sub-committee), and \"the Spanish inquisition\" (Mick Brookes, president of the National Association of Head Teachers) - reflects the persistent complaint that he has created a climate in schools where good teachers leave and potentially good teachers don't join; that the inspection system imposes insufferable strain on heads, on teachers, and on pupils. </p> <p>\"It is inevitably going to be stressful in the sense that the school knows something is going to be written on them, that individual teachers are going to have somebody sitting in the back of their classroom. I don't think it should be and need be stressful to the extent that some people appear to believe,\" says Mr Woodhead. </p> <p>\"A school is inspected once every four or five years. You as a teacher will be seen perhaps three periods in that four to five years. The inspector is required to talk to you about what he or she thinks of your performance. You have the opportunity to put your point of view. Is this unreasonable?\" </p> <p>While he acknowledges that when the Ofsted hammer falls on a school deemed to be failing, there is \"in the short-term, a negative impact on pupils who will feel badly about what's happened to them\", in time those schools thank him. </p> <p>The last time he looked there were \"13,000\" incompetent teachers, but new, light inspections for successful schools means he will not be able to confidently make such headline-grabbing judgments in future. </p> <p>He expects his annual report next year will cover \"the same basic themes\", describing \"very radical and very positive\" changes in primary schools since the in troduction of the literacy and numeracy strategies, but a more mixed picture in secondary schools, and continued problems with writing ability across the board. </p> <p>\"The only way the morale of the profession is going to improve is when teachers teach better. Because when teachers teach better, children will learn more, and when children learn more their parents will respect teachers more. And when teachers have got the respect of parents in the local community they are going to feel better about themselves. </p> <p><b> Morale booster</b><br> \"Ofsted contributes to this virtuous circle by showing parents where schools and teachers are doing a good job and where there are problems bringing those problems out into the open so that solutions can be found and things can get better.\" </p> <p>Even if it could be proved to Mr Woodhead that teachers' morale was damaged by Ofsted, that would not invalidate his organisation's work. \"I don't think it is our job. If I was primarily concerned with the morale of the teaching profession that would inhibit the ability of Ofsted to report accurately on what it sees. My first and foremost responsibility is to tell the truth about the schools that we inspect. And if, to put it bluntly, we find things are wrong and we have to say that, then so be it. The interests of the children and the accuracy of the report are more important than the feelings of the teachers.\" </p> <p>He was once a teacher himself, from 1969-1976. But he got bored and moved into teacher training, and then policy, as an adviser on English, a county education officer and chief executive of the national curriculum council. \"I do need new challenges, different situations, so I sought those out.\" </p> <p>Doesn't that make him unsympathetic to teachers who have stuck with it, year after year? \"No, the reverse actually. I'm full of admiration for those people who have maintained their enthusiasm, and in some ways I'm envious.\" </p> <p>How, one wonders, would the chief inspector of today have fared during an Ofsted inspection of the teacher he was then? He was, by most accounts, somewhat liberal, even trendy. </p> <p>\"I don't know. My views about teaching have changed, although I think Ted Wragg [professor of education at Exeter University] and others have tended to exaggerate the extent of the change. </p> <p>\"As an English teacher I always believed in the importance of spelling and grammar. I always believed in the importance of trying to inculcate a level of literature - trying to, I didn't always succeed. I think and I hope that I would be marked reasonably positively. It's a long time ago and I might be deluding myself.\" </p> <p>When his current contract runs out in 2003, Mr Woodhead will have been chief inspector for nine years. He will earn \u00a3124,000 plus a bonus of up to 10% this year. His empire is undergoing a major expansion as Ofsted takes on the main responsibility for inspecting all sixth-form and further education colleges; and for registering and inspecting about 100,000 childminders, nursery and playgroup workers, an operation that will expand Ofsted's staff from 500 to about 2,500, mostly former local authority workers. </p> <p>Once he has that sorted, there is just a flicker of a hint that Mr Woodhead, now 53, might call it a day. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment tells the Guardian there is no term limit, his contract could be renewed again and again. But Mr Woodhead is under the impression that he is only allowed to do two five-year terms. \"Whether, if I so wanted and the government wanted me to, I could do a third term, I just don't know.\" And after Ofsted? Maybe another job. \"I've still got a fair amount of energy.\" </p> <p>Last year there were moments when Mr Woodhead thought his tenure might end sooner rather than later. </p> <p>He had said, at Prof Wragg's university, that relationships between sixth-formers and teachers could be \"experiential and educative\" - as the government was planning legislation to make such relationships illegal. Although he withdrew his comments, his ex-wife Cathy then claimed that his relationship with Amanda Johnston, a former pupil of his, had begun while she was still at school; a charge Ms Johnston and Mr Woodhead had both denied in signed statements. Cue furore. The strain of the controversy contributed to the break-up of his10-year relationship with Ruth Miskin, the head of a primary school in Tower Hamlets, in London. He is currently unattached. But backed by Tony Blair and David Blunkett, the education secretary, he held on. </p> <p>\"It would be dishonest to say that when you read in the papers, day in, day out, that people are calling for your resignation you don't wonder about your ability to carry on. </p> <p>\"And to an extent, of course, my ability to do the job depends on my credibility, and innuendo, rumour, allegation and gossip can erode credibility. So yeah, I wondered, although my basic feeling throughout was that I was determined to do the job that I was paid to do and I'd go on doing it. And the more it became clear that to an extent all this had a fair bit to do with people who didn't like me as chief inspector, the more determined I was to do stick it out. </p> <p>\"When you've been through an experience like that then it does put other things in perspective. When there's some controversy about a policy difference between me and Blair or Blunkett, really that doesn't bother me in the slightest. It's a different order of things. </p> <p>\"You also know that life goes on and I think that with any job you've got to be able to walk away from it. Having said I was determined to stay, I knew that if I decided to go or somebody else decided that I had to go, then so be it, I could accept that.\" </p> <p><b> Party politics</b><br> Mr Blunkett would have been less distraught than Mr Blair if Mr Woodhead had decided to fall. But the chief inspector says: \"My feeling from where I sat then was that both David Blunkett and Tony Blair were supportive of me in a difficult situation.\" He sees the prime minister formally three times a year, at \"summits\" in Downing Street. \"There may be other occasions, but not often ... I've always found him interested in what Ofsted's doing, supportive of what we are doing and generally sympathetic to the kinds of values and arguments that I have put forward.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett has a meeting with him every month or so, without officials. \"It's up to him as to whether he acts on what I've got to say, but in terms of receiving the message, I've got no complaints at all.\" </p> <p>He does not see William Hague, who wants to give him even more power and, no, he didn't advise the Tory leader on his recent \"free schools\" speech, even though he said that it had \"struck a chord\". \"In fact,\" says Mr Woodhead, \"there isn't a great deal of party political difference.\" </p> <p>He restrains himself on some issues, grammar schools for instance, although he pointedly praises their inspection record. But no one can accuse him of not speaking out. He raided into higher education territory recently, not his responsibility at all, blasting vocational degree courses. </p> <p>The prime minister wants half of all under 30s to have participated in higher education. Mr Woodhead says: \"There is obviously a danger if we go down the expansion road for the sake of expansion, that universities are forced into a situation where in order to fill the places they lower their standards of admission. That would be a great mistake.\" </p> <p>He welcomes changes to the new post-16 curriculum which will provide alternatives to traditional A-levels, in vocational A-levels and advanced GNVQs [General National Vocational Qualification]. But at the same time, he says: \"What I don't want is a sort of blurring of the distinctions so that you erode what seems to me virtuous and necessary in the traditional A-level. </p> <p>\"Part of the function of examinations is to make distinctions between people for employers, higher education or whatever. If everybody is passing, everybody has a reward, then I do think we've got problems... it is vitally important that we hold on to the notion of traditional academic excellence.\" </p> <p>\"Curriculum 2000\" will encourage all students to take more vocational qualifications, and certainly to study a greater variety. Sixth-formers will be expected to complete four or five AS-level subjects in the first half of their course before taking three A-levels. </p> <p>Mr Woodhead says: \"I'm not necessarily a supporter of breadth for breadth's sake. There are students who have got for example 10 A grades at GCSE, who want to study three subjects at A-level and who can benefit from the in-depth pursuit of knowledge in those three subjects. </p> <p>\"They've demonstrated the breadth of their achievement at GCSE and I can't see myself why they shouldn't have the opportunity post-16 to pursue the subjects that they want to pursue.\" </p> <p>On the relatively poor performance of boys at A-level and GCSE, which dominated the agenda while Mr Woodhead was on holiday, he is less concerned than you might expect. </p> <p>He says he has not spoken to Mr Blunkett about it. \"I don't think there's any panacea.\" He once publicly worried about the performance of working-class white boys, but he says now: \"I'm not particularly persuaded that we are seeing a laddish culture that we have never seen before. I think boys have always been tempted by laddish behaviour and there's nothing radically new now in 2000 that wasn't there when I was growing up.\" It is \"wholly positive\" that the rising expectations of girls are being measured in exams. </p> <p>\"The answer, if we need an answer, lies in the remorseless application of good teaching.\" Remorseless application: Mr Woodhead, for better or worse, is good at that.</p>",
  "A government minister will next week reopen the emotionally charged debate on immigration policy by suggesting a loosening of the laws to allow more technically qualified people to settle here to meet the huge skills shortage. <p>Barbara Roche, the Home Office minister responsible for immigration, is certain to raise the question before the next general election of whether Britain can benefit economically by encouraging more highly qualified people into the country. </p> <p>The speech, which is seen by other senior ministers as brave in view of the dangers of a backlash from the right wing, will aim to change the philosophical debate from what one called \"the present two dimensional picture\" of immigrants versus natives. </p> <p>Mrs Roche, previously a Department of Trade and Treasury minister, intends to draw on her wide experience from other parts of government to argue the case that Britain will be better off with a more flexible policy. </p> <p>Both ministries are acutely aware that Britain is suffering from skills shortages that could damage the economy and hold back business. The crisis in recruitment is wide-ranging, from IT workers to doctors and teachers. </p> <p>A senior minister said it had been agreed that she should emphasise the historic role economic migrants had played in Britain and how \"we are a nation of migrants\" and how the idea of a pure British race was \"a myth\". She will be giving her talk on September 11 at the Institution of Public Policy Research at a seminar sponsored by the British Bankers Association. </p> <p>Mrs Roche intends to personalise the issue by drawing on her own antecedents. Her family background goes back to the time of Jewish emigration from Portugal at the time of Cromwell and also to Jewish families fleeing from Russia and Eastern Europe. </p> <p>The Home Office is known to want to tread warily and is more keen on long term reform of the system than introducing short term policy changes. </p> <p>Mrs Roche's boss, Jack Straw, is acutely aware of the rightwing backlash over aslyum seekers and is seen in Whitehall as ultra cautious in introducing major changes in such a sensitive area. But he is also keen on opening up debate, and will watch public reaction to the speech with close interest. </p> <p>Reports in the Sunday papers that Mrs Roche will announce a specific target of 100,000 extra economic migrants and plans to announce new pilot schemes next week to attract economic migrants were denied yester day. Mike O Brien, the Home Office minister responsible for freedom of information, described such information as \"false.\" </p> <p>Interviewed on GMTV's Sunday Programme with Alastair Stewart, Mr O'Brien was asked whether it was true or false that the government was inviting 100,000 foreigners. </p> <p>He replied: \"Largely false. It appears to hinge on the issue of some sort of points system, which we're not really considering at the moment... Barbara Roche indicated that we were looking at the shortages and how to deal with those, but this sort of idea... is largely exaggerated.\" </p> <p>The Conservatives look placed to oppose any suggestion of change. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, yesterday questioned whether a relaxation in the rules was really necessary. \"We have got a work permit scheme which allows you to import labour where you can't get local skills,\" she said. </p> <p>Rather than relaxing immigration rules, it would make more sense to improve the skills of the indigenous workforce, she argued. </p> <p>\"I'm not against bringing in skills from outside, but what doesn't make good economic sense is to use that as a first resort, rather than trying to skill your own workforce first.\" </p> <p>At present, anybody from the European Union getting a job in Britain can settle here under European laws allowing freedom of movement, provided mutual qualifications are recognised. People from other countries require work permits to come here and these are granted for specific periods depending on job shortages.</p>",
  "William Hague will make his strongest attack on Europe this week as he commits his party to fighting the next general election on Britain's right to govern itself. <p>The threat to British sovereignty will be the main theme of a new pre-manifesto document, Believing in Britain, which is certain to be endorsed by the Tory faithful as a main plank for the next election. Mr Hague will pledge that a Conservative government would draw up and enshrine in legislation a list of powers which cannot be handed over to European institutions, nor ceded by treaty. </p> <p>Tomorrow's document will argue that in terms of European integration, the nations of the EU are reaching a limit beyond which individual countries will not be able to claim to be sovereign nations, and that a line must be drawn to prevent Britain sliding into a European superstate. </p> <p>That line would take the form of the statutory list of non-negotiable powers, with areas likely to feature including tax, defence, welfare, health and education. By objecting to these, the Tories would hope to wreck any moves to integration and stop Europe implementing any further reforms. </p> <p>Any opposition from European partners would be likely to be met by Britain threatening to renegotiate deals already concluded. </p> <p>This point was made firmly yesterday by Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, who told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost: \"I think we do need to have a good look at the whole process of decision making.\" </p> <p>The tougher Conservative line risks alienating the few remaining pro-European Tories left at Westminster. Michael Ancram, the Tory chairman, tried yesterday to rein in some of Ms Widdecombe's views by emphasising that the main Tory attack wll be on future concessions by Tony Blair's government at the forthcoming European Union summit in Nice, rather than raking over previous deals. </p> <p>The former prime minister, Sir Edward Heath, immediately issued a warning to Mr Hague, not to allow the party to become too extreme on issues such as membership of the EU. </p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview, the Father of the House yesterday attacked Mr Hague's leadership, saying he needed to take a longer-term approach to policies rather than just reacting to issues because there could be a general election looming. </p> <p>Reacting to the Tories' plan not to concede any more powers to Brussels, Sir Edward told GMTV's The Sunday Programme: \"I have no idea whether that is going to be their platform but, if they do, it is nonsense. And they expect others to go on accepting us if that is the line we take? What is more, it will be to our loss. There will be developments there that could be very valuable to us. So I hope this is not going to appear in these manifesto notes due out during this coming week.\" </p> <p>Sir Edward also criticised the party's stance on Europe. \"When Mr Hague has his refrain about 'we want to be in Europe but not run by Europe' does that mean we take no part in running Europe? If we do not, how can we be in Europe? If we expect other people to have us in Europe but avoid everything we do not like, who is going to put up with that? Nobody.\" </p> <p>The Tory document comes as the pressure group, Business for Sterling, today launches a multimillion pound campaign to persuade voters not to dump the pound and to commit Britain to remaining forever outside the common European currency. The pressure group has called in Maurice and Charles Saatchi to design the campaign and persuaded the arts entrepreneur and songwriter, Sir Tim Rice, to launch a public funding appeal. </p> <p>Business for Sterling has combined with another pressure group, New Europe, to run the campaign and has recruited the Eurosceptic ex-Labour minister, Frank Field, and ex-Tory cabinet ministers, Nigel Lawson and Malcolm Rifkind, to debate the issues at party conferences this month. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, yesterday criticised the new Tory document. \"It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain. The real problem for the Tory party is believing in the Tories. Nobody believes the Tories, either on their record of 18 years [in government] or on their promises, that change from month to month.\"</p>",
  "Only 11 days into the new Labour government, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, called a press conference at the Foreign Office proudly to proclaim a new kind of foreign policy. In future there would be an ethical dimension in the conduct of foreign affairs. <p>It was a radical departure. Traditionally the culture of the Foreign Office was to place national self-interest over all other considerations. Now those could be subverted to the demands of human rights. </p> <p>Mr Cook, on the left wing of the party, had been on hundreds of marches and meetings protesting about international outrages down the years that he was in opposition. He had scolded the then Conservative government over the arms-to-Iraq scandal. Now it was his turn in power, and the approach of the stuffy old Foreign Office was going to change. </p> <p>He promised that his conscience would not be parked while he was foreign secretary. He said: \"The government does not accept that political values can be left behind when we check in our passports.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, all his good intentions lasted only a further 77 days, when he admitted that he was reluctantly giving the go-ahead for the sale of Hawk jets, armoured cars and water cannon to the repressive Indonesian regime. </p> <p>That caused an outcry that turned into a shrill blast when Hawk jets, billed as being exported only for training, were spotted flying over East Timor as the Indonesian army tried to quell the independence movement. The Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, phoned Tony Blair to protest. </p> <p>Mr Cook became defensive, retreating into semantics. He said he had never promised to conduct an ethical foreign policy, but had pledged only to ensure there would be an \"ethical dimension\" in decision-making. Downing Street did not like the headlines, which played badly with Labour's traditional constituency. International human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, as well as campaigners against the arms trade, were prepared - as they still are - to give Mr Cook the benefit of the doubt. They did not like a lot of what he was doing, but at least he was trying. </p> <p>Mr Cook was to become increasingly frustrated in his efforts. Inside the Foreign Office the idea of an ethical foreign policy had not won universal support. There were signs all this year that it was on its last legs. </p> <p>When he sat down with ministerial colleagues and others to formulate foreign policy for the next general election, one thing was clear: the price of trying to follow an ethical one had become politically too high. </p> <p>The biggest problem for Mr Cook was that his attempts to stem unethical arms sales were repeatedly blocked by the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Blair, called in to adjudicate, came down on the side of the arms industry. In January Mr Cook lost out in an internal battle over maintaining an arms embargo on the military junta in Pakistan and then a month later over providing spare parts for Hawk jets for use by Zimbabwe in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was justified in terms of Britain having to honour contract commitments entered into by the Conservative government. </p> <p>It was the same argument as put forward in the row over Hawk jets to Indonesia, when Mr Cook had said: \"It is not practical to backdate these new criteria to apply to decisions on licences already taken by the previous administration.\" </p> <p>The extent to which Labour was distancing itself from its ethical foreign policy became public when Mr Cook's deputy, Peter Hain, in an interview with the New Statesman magazine in April, hinted that perhaps it had been a mistake. </p> <p>Mr Hain said: \"I think, if there was a mistake made, it was in allowing the policy [on the ethical dimension] to be presented as if we could have perfection. The phrase 'ethical foreign policy' was never used - it was 'ethical dimension'. But in a sense it was a hook on which we found ourselves, and I think it obscured the very big advances we have made.\" </p> <p>On the plus side Mr Cook has accumulated a lot of credit, having pushed along the EU code of conduct on arms sales and introduced at least some transparency into British arms exports by publishing annual reports. </p> <p>This year's report shows that Britain continues to sell to countries with poor human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia and China. </p> <p>The problem the government faces is that too much credence continues to be given to the defence industry in the belief that lots of jobs are dependent upon it. The MoD puts the number of jobs reliant on exports at 40,000. Defence academics regard this as an exaggeration. </p> <p>The aggressive pursuit of arms sales - which makes Britain the second biggest seller after the US - is almost impossible to reconcile with an ethical dimension to foreign policy, as Labour has now formally accepted. </p> <p> <b>Rise and fall of a radical approach</b></p> <p><b> May 1997</b><br> The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, announces the birth of an ethical foreign policy. </p> <p><b> August 1997</b><br> Cook refuses to block the sale of Hawk jets to Indonesia.

  "The Liberal Democrats are to become the first party in Britain to pledge to abolish statutory retirement at the age of 65 in their next manifesto. <p>The policy - certain to be passed at their conference - will mean employers will no longer be able automatically to retire people at 60 or 65 - but employees will still have the right to quit and claim a pension. </p> <p>The policy change, which gives people over 70 the right to an annual check-up so that the healthy can work up to their 80s - has been proposed in the light of government figures showing the \"greying\" of Britain. In 20 years time, the number of people aged 50 to 74 will equal those aged 25 to 49. </p> <p>The policy will also affect pension provision, mortgages, life insurance and employment policies, since the aim is to abolish age discrimination by removing all legislation which lays down a compulsory retirement date. </p> <p>The proposal is among a series of changes which a senior Liberal spokesman said aimed to put the party \"ahead of Labour\" in policy making. Most of the changes are expected to be passed this month at the party's conference, which will also debate a pre-manifesto document to be released later this week. </p> <p>This document will contain radical tax changes including a lower rate of tax and higher thresholds for the poorest paid, and the restoration of a 50% tax rate for those earning \u00a3100,000 a year or more. The party is also pledged to bring in a \u00a35 a week rise for pensioners, against Labour's 75p increase this year, and a top-up worth \u00a310 a week for those over 80 and \u00a35 a week for those over 75. </p> <p>Other proposed changes include maximum class sizes of 18 pupils for science, technology and modern language lessons to improve teaching in areas where British children can perform poorly. </p> <p>They also propose to scrap the national school targets introduced by Labour and instead lay down one statutory duty on all schools to develop an individual education plan for each pupil. </p> <p>The party will promise to scrap charges for tuition fees in universities introduced by Labour. </p> <p>Other proposals include free admission to all national and muncipal museums. Labour is still pledged to charge \u00a31 at most national museums and allows muncipal museums to charge what they like. The Lib-Dems also want a greenfield development tax to put off developers from building in the countryside, and oppose Labour plans for part-privatisation of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. </p> <p>They will call for the repeal of home secretary Jack Straw's laws that give government access to private emails. Emphasis in the pre-manifesto documents and at the conference will be on the defence of liberty and attacks on Labour and Tory authoritarianism. </p> <p>The pre-manifesto document says: \"At the next general election there will only be one party that is committed to this wide agenda of freedom. It means the right to live our lives free from threat, bullying or unlawful force. </p> <p>\"Over the last 50 years the UK has become a highly centralised state. Control after control on individuals and communities have been imposed. By instinct, both Labour and the Conservatives have a strong interfering streak, in private lives and the economy.\" </p> <p>Richard Grayson, the party's director of policy, said: \"This is a bold policy which reflects the changes which are happening in modern Britain and would give older people more freedom to live the way they wish without being dictated to by big brother.\"</p>",
  "The Kosovo war was the last European war of the 20th century, and Nato's first. What do we know about it a year later? Was the Nato action a \"humanitarian intervention\", as its advocates maintained? The answer partly depends on whether there was a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo on March 23, 1999, the day before the bombing began. <p>\"Yes,\" say supporters of the action. There was still a humanitarian disaster left over from the previous year. Milosevic had begun a new wave of ethnic cleansing before Nato started bombing. German intelligence claimed to have evidence of a Serbian \"Operation Horseshoe\" initiated already in late February, designed to clear a horseshoe-shaped swathe of Kosovo. </p> <p>\"No,\" say its critics. It was the bombing that caused the mass expulsions. To adapt Karl Kraus's famous remark about psychiatry, Nato's action was the disease for which it claimed to be the cure. </p> <p>The truth is more complicated than either position. Anyone who was in Kosovo, as I was, in the winter of 1998-1999 could see that there was a humanitarian disaster. Most of the 300,000 homeless had found some rudimentary shelter, but their houses were often destroyed, their wells poisoned, and they had no means of livelihood. Moreover, in February and March of 1999 the Serbs were pouring forces back into Kosovo. Whether or not there was an actual plan called \"Operation Horseshoe\", there clearly was some operational planning for large-scale expulsions, otherwise they could not have been implemented so quickly. Serb forces started systematic cleansing as the Kosovo Verification Mission pulled out, just before the bombing started. </p> <p>However, this last month of preparations and actions could be interpreted as anticipation of the bombing that would follow from Milosevic's rejection of an unacceptable agreement. One of the sources quoted by Tim Judah in his book Kosovo: War and Revenge (Yale University Press) summarises the attitude of Serbian security forces crudely but effectively: \"We'll fuck'em if they start!\" There is no question that as soon as the bombing did start the ethnic cleansing was accelerated - a word used by General Naumann. Yet, I repeat, a humanitarian disaster was already there. In early 1999 the balance of probability was that, absent further decisive action by the West, the Albanian-Serb conflict on the ground would again have escalated to produce a still worse humanitarian crisis in the spring and summer of 1999. It is, however, a basic rule of historical logic that one can never state with certainty \"what would have happened if... \" </p> <p>There is no reason to doubt that Western leaders were concerned about this real human suffering. However, as politicians they were undoubtedly more concerned about the human suffering of the Kosovar Albanians than they were about that of the Congolese, Angolans, Sierra Leoneans, Rwandans, or Colombians, because television and the press covered Kosovo more intensely and graphically, with energetic commentaries from what one British minister sarcastically called the \"something-must-be-done brigade\". So this was also a war for which the mass media were implicitly and explicitly making a case. </p> <p>Furthermore, western European leaders stressed the motive of averting \"humanitarian disaster\" so strongly because this was the only way in which taking military action without the sanction of a UN security council resolution - something they had recoiled from doing for the best part of a year - might possibly be justified in international law. This legal expedient had been suggested by a British foreign office memorandum circulated to Britain's Nato allies as early as October 1998. Yet the Foreign Affairs Committee concludes that the operation was at best of \"dubious\" legality. For legal and political reasons, it was never called a war. In his book Virtual War: Kosovo and Beyond (Metropolitan Books) Michael Ignatieff quotes Anthony Cordesman's wry conclusion: \"One of the lessons of modern war is that war can no longer be called war.\" </p> <p>In sum, it is more accurate to say that the Nato action started as a piece of coercive diplomacy. It was designed to compel Milosevic to agree to a political settlement involving far-reaching autonomy for Kosovo. One major motive for desiring such a political settlement was humanitarian concern, but equally important was a longstanding fear for the \"stability\" of the region. Since 1992 Nato's nightmare had been that a conflict involving Albanians would tear apart Macedonia, with its large Albanian minority, bringing in Bulgaria and Nato members Greece and Turkey. Western European countries were also worried about a new influx of refugees. Finally, after so many empty threats and called bluffs, Nato leaders felt the alliance had to act to preserve its own credibility as its 50th anniversary approached. </p> <p>The first six weeks of the war hardly enhanced Nato's credibility. It is a remarkable fact that for at least a month the most powerful military alliance in history, with member states representing some two thirds of the world's economic and military strength, with four million men and women under arms, and combined defence spending of around $450bn, seemed to be losing to a small, impoverished Balkan country with a defense budget of scarcely $1.5bn and about 110,000 active-duty soldiers. </p> <p>Why did Goliath do so badly? First, because he misjudged his opponent. Second, because he fought with one arm tied behind his back, most of his weapons stuck in the sand, and several large men tugging at his belt in different directions. The misjudgment was twofold: thinking Milosevic would cave in much sooner than he did and not anticipating the speed, scale and brutality of the mass expulsions. </p> <p>Policymakers interviewed today tell you that of course they knew, privately, that it could be a long haul. Cross-questioned on American television the night the bombing started, Madeleine Albright said, \"I don't see this as a long-term operation. I think that this is something... that is achievable within a relatively short period of time.\" Note the word \"relatively\", her former spokesman James Rubin told me, when I recently talked to him. Politicians, so the argument made by Rubin and others runs, could not say publicly all that they thought privately, for fear of alienating the two big Cs: the US Congress and the Coalition. Congressional doubters, Greek, Italian and German allies, simply could not be \"brought on board\" if told the truth - that this might be a long war. Let alone that it might be a ground war. </p> <p>These retrospective claims are impossible to test, because we don't have the records of top-level secret meetings at which such private farsightedness might have been articulated. It is clearly true that the two big-C constituencies had to be coaxed along gently. Yet a strong dose of scepticism is in order. Not only do most observers who were there at the time testify that Western leaders seemed convinced that it would be over quickly. More important, senior Nato commanders say they were instructed accordingly. </p> <p>Thus, for example, the plain-speaking American commander of allied air forces, General Michael Short: \"I can't tell you how many times the instruction I got was, 'Mike, you're only going to be allowed to bomb two, maybe three nights. That's all Washington can stand. That's all some members of the alliance can stand. That's why you've only got 90 targets. This'll be over in three nights.'\" </p> <p> According to a New York Times investigation, when the bombing began on March 24 Nato had a total of 219 targets prepared - enough for less than a week. Nato's commander of southern forces, Admiral James Ellis, later observed, \"We called this one absolutely wrong.\" It's one thing for politicians not to have told their publics that they privately judged this might be a long, difficult war. Politics means being economical with the truth. But what are we to conclude if they didn't even tell their own military? </p> <p>Moreover, no western leader claims that he or she anticipated Milosevic's immediate mass expulsions. According to Ignatieff, General Wesley Clark's \"intelligence people\" had anticipated up to 200,000 new Kosovar refugees. Within a month, there were some 850,000. To those who had dealt closely with Milosevic, this response was not \"impossible to predict\". Both President Kucan of Slovenia and President Gligorov of Macedonia warned of the danger. But had we not ourselves dealt closely with Milosevic? </p> <p>So there was a failure of Western political intelligence, with both a large and a small I. For the large I: astonishingly, the Defence Intelligence Agency did not even include Kosovo in its February 1999 survey of world trouble spots. The CIA's signal contribution was to suggest the Chinese embassy as a bombing target, believing it to be the headquarters of Yugoslavia's Federal Directorate of Supply and Procurement. (This was the only target proposed by the CIA.) For the small i: Western leaders, trying to prevent \"another Bosnia,\" learned a wrong lesson from Bosnia. They thought Milosevic had been bombed into accepting the Dayton agreement in 1995. They forgot that it had first required a large ground offensive - by Croatian troops. </p> <p>Another mistake was to suggest that the high-altitude bombing campaign, prescribed by the American obsession with \"zero casualties\", could stop ethnic cleansing on the ground. One of the goals President Clinton proclaimed in his television address at the beginning of the war was \"to deter an even bloodier offensive against innocent civilians in Kosovo\". The bombing campaign did something very close to the opposite. In fact, there were two parallel but largely separate campaigns: the tactical one, aimed at preventing Serbian forces in Kosovo from doing further harm to the Albanians, and the strategic one, aimed at Serbia proper. Nato won the second, but lost the first. </p> <p>A combination of weather, peasant cunning and low-tech diversions confounded Nato's multibillion dollar high-tech weapons, as they tried to find and destroy Serbian armor in Kosovo. It turns out that laser-guided bombs are very difficult to use through clouds. Kosovo in spring is cloudy. Sophisticated cruise missiles home in on the radar of air defense systems. So the Serbs turned on the radar for a few seconds, then turned it off - and those poor, disoriented missiles wandered off into Bulgaria. One landed in a bathroom in Sofia. The Serbs built decoy bridges out of plastic; Nato knocked them down. The Serbs set up woodburning stoves, with their chimneys angled to look like gun barrels; Nato took them out with exquisite accuracy. The Serbs put painted logs on the backs of trucks; Nato obliged again. At the end of the war, Nato claimed that it had destroyed some 120 Serbian tanks, 220 armored personnel carriers, and 450 artillery and mortar pieces. But the Serbian armoured columns that withdrew from Kosovo looked in remarkably good shape. according to a suppressed US Air Force report obtained by Newsweek, Nato verifiably destroyed just 14 tanks, 18 armored personnel carriers, and 20 artillery pieces. Even if the real figures are higher than that, it is an indisputable fact that ethnic cleansing increased under the bombing. As Tim Judah observes, the main weapon of ethnic cleansing is the cigarette lighter (to set fire to houses). How many cigarette lighters can you hit from 15,000 feet? </p> <p>Of course, nothing ever goes according to plan in the fog of war. It was always hubris to believe that high-tech wars would be different. But the war Nato lost in Kosovo was not just about the humbling of high-tech hubris. It was also about the mismatch between political ends and military means. Yet the military means were themselves prescribed (and proscribed) by the politics of democratic coalition warfare. </p> <p>Why did Milosevic finally cave in? Once again: we really don't know what made the difference to that poisoned but calculating mind. Perhaps it was the fact that his wife, Mira, whom everyone agrees has enormous influence over him, got weepy at the bombing of their Belgrade house? Or was it his business cronies, worried that the West was now targeting their foreign bank accounts? </p> <p> We can point to a number of things that happened shortly before he conceded, but the direct causal connection is nowhere established. For example, on May 27 he was indicted for atrocities in Kosovo by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague. Many of us thought this could make ending the war more difficult, since he might feel that he had nothing to lose. But just a week later he accepted the peace terms dictated by the European emissary, Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, and the Russian emissary Viktor Chernomyrdin. Now some say: \"Ah, he settled because he knew that anything else would bring him one step closer to the Hague.\" But who knows? </p> <p>A plausible speculation would point to four main factors. First, Milosevic had thought the Nato coalition would crumble. Instead, it held, and grew stronger after the 50th- anniversary summit in Washington in late April. </p> <p>One of the main reasons for this growing solidity of the coalition was popular outrage at the television and newspaper pictures of the Kosovar Albanian expellees, and especially at those scenes - described with wearisome predictability as \"biblical\" - of the huddled masses in a field at Blace, on the border with Macedonia. These images outweighed the negative impact of Nato's killing of civilians, either through pilot error (the train on a bridge, the refugee convoy), or mistaken targeting (the Chinese embassy), or the deliberate acceptance of civilian casualties (the Serbian television station). There are multiple ironies here. Perhaps Nato's greatest miscalculation was not to anticipate Milosevic's swift and brutal expulsion of the Kosovars. But, as it turned out, that was Milosevic's greatest mistake. Would the coalition have held through 78 days of bombing if Milosevic had just hunkered down and said, \"Here we are, poor innocent victims, a sovereign country being attacked without any good cause or UN Security Council resolution.\"? One may reasonably doubt it. So Milosevic saved the Nato coalition. Secondly, Nato did what General Short had been urging it do since the very beginning of the war: it went \"for the head of the snake\". Crucially, the bombers started destroying Belgrade's electrical power grids. Not just disabling them for a few hours with graphite bombs, as they had earlier done, but demolishing them. This damaged Milosevic's central command and control system, and the morale of his population. It also meant that patients on life-support systems and babies in hospital incubators had their power cut off. </p> <p>Thirdly, the alliance was at last moving toward a credible threat of ground invasion, as Britain had been suggesting from early in the war. Clinton's initial television address on March 24 contained the following sentence, written by his national security adviser, Samuel Berger: \"But I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war.\" Berger has subsequently maintained that: \"We would not have won the war without this sentence.\" The US Congress and coalition partners such as Germany would have revolted. Yet by May, the same Clinton and Berger were deliberately saying that no option was ruled out. On May 20, General Clark briefed Clinton on possible timetables for a ground invasion, and on May 21 Clinton publicly suggested increas ing the deployment of Nato troops around Kosovo - ostensibly still for a peacekeeping force - to 50,000. Nato forces began building up a road to take heavy armor through Albania to the Kosovo border. </p> <p>Finally, Russian emissaries told Milosevic that the deal he was offered was the best he could get. Russia would back him no further. This was said publicly by Chernomyrdin - whom the US had deliberately briefed about its ground invasion plans. The message was also reinforced privately, in a communication from the Russian military and security establishment, brought to Milosevic by a Swedish businessman named Peter Castenfelt. The change in the Russian position must have been a major blow to Milosevic. It was, as the Yugoslav foreign minister tells Judah with most un-Serbian understatement, \"I must admit, very relevant\". To give credit where due: bringing Russia into the coalition to put more pressure on Milosevic was a characteristic achievement of the Clinton administration. </p> <p>Thus, in the end, and at vast cost, Nato won the larger war for Kosovo. </p> <p>And the consequences? It really is too soon to say. Kosovo today is liberated - and an almighty mess. Western leaders failed to prepare for peace, as they had failed to prepare for war. Crucially, the UN administration in Kosovo was not provided with the police, judges, and jailers to establish the first prerequisite of any functioning state or protectorate: an effective monopoly of legitimate violence. Anyone who thought that because the Kosovar Albanians had long been victims they were therefore \"the good guys\" has received a sobering lesson, as Kosovars have conducted reverse ethnic cleansing of the Serbs - under the noses of Nato troops. But how it turns out in the end is still a matter of human choice. </p> <p>As for Serbia proper, the question at the war's end was: will Milosevic prove to be Europe's Galtieri (the Argentinian president deposed after losing the Falklands war) or Europe's Saddam Hussein? At the moment, he looks more like Europe's Saddam. But although it looks unlikely, he may yet be defeated in the presidential elections on September 24 . After all, if the Kosovo war teaches us anything, it is that we should always expect surprises. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited version of an article that appears in the current issue of the New York Review of Books.

  "It is an admission which I make with some embarrassment but, confession being good for the soul, I reveal that, during the last few days, my thoughts have constantly turned to John Redwood. My aberrant behaviour began in the middle of last week, shortly after listening to a discussion on the Today programme. The topic was David Howell's new book on the politics of the global economy. The author's own contribution was, as you would expect, highly intelligent but totally uninspired. The international market had, he said, reduced politicians' ability to control national economies. They should, he argued, accept that truth and, instead of claiming powers which they do not possess, concentrate on creating a climate in which the people they represent gain most from the new reality. <p>That proposition is so difficult to deny that, at first, I wondered what Mr Redwood - invited onto the programme to stimulate some kind of discussion - would say, in addition to \"Quite right\". I should have guessed. First he denounced the government for damaging small businesses. Then he attacked the EU for imposing unnecessary burdens on companies of every size. Lord Howell had spoken in the language of the corporate seminar. Mr Redwood sounded like a bar-parlour Young Conservative. I have no doubt that diehard Tories who were listening loved every cliche. </p> <p>I attributed my surprise at Mr Redwood's conduct to the early hour in which the discussion took place. Had I been fully awake I would have remembered that he always behaves in the same way. During an Any Questions? broadcast in July, he was asked his opinion about the prosecution of the headmistress who was accused (and eventually acquitted) of striking one of the children in her school. He answered that New Labour encouraged an environment in which \"the wrong people get punished\". </p> <p>Earlier in the year, when we appeared together on a television programme called Powerhouse, I so despaired of provoking him into serious discussion that I spent my time drawing attention to his talent for repeating hackneyed slogans as if they were revelations of a previous unrecognised truth. If he were to make a guest appearance on Coronation Street, Mr Redwood would explain to Natalie that Les Battersby is the product of socialist-induced dependency culture. </p> <p>Mr Redwood is, we are constantly assured, a man of formidable intellect - Fellow of All Souls, merchant banking infant prodigy and head of Margaret Thatcher's policy unit. Somewhere along the way he must have been told - and shown the opinion polls to prove - that there is nothing floating voters like less than political point scoring. They disapprove of it even during overtly political debate. When party points are made during discussion of apparently unpolitical topics, they are instantly alienated from whoever made them and the cause which he or she supports. The voters the Tories must win if they are ever to form a government admire brave Doctor Mowlam and amiable Mr Steven Norris - two politicians who are thought to be above politics. Why does Mr Redwood antagonise potential support which is essential to Conservative success? </p> <p>I put aside, at once, the thought that Mr Redwood actually wants a Conservative defeat. And I discard - with almost equal certainty - the possibility that, confronted with camera or microphone, he is engulfed in a red mist which prevents him from behaving with rational calm. There is, in fact, only one plausible explanation. He knows that his party is doomed and believes it his duty to enthuse the hard core of Conservative voters who enjoy the party sniping which normal people detest. Whether he courts the diminishing band of loyalists on his own, or his party's, behalf will only be clear when the defeat which he anticipates comes about. </p> <p>The one thing to be said in favour of the Redwood broadcasting style is that it is based on a strategy - a suicidal strategy, but a strategy nevertheless. So it is just possible to argue that his behaviour, although ridiculous, is more grown-up than attempts to attract support by boasting about teenage drinking exploits and identifying ex-girlfriends. But both weird Tory campaigning techniques have one thing in common. They are the product of despair. </p> <p>The problem of the Redwood approach - at least for the Tories - is that, because it anticipates defeat at the next election, it makes defeat more certain at the one which follows. The people who wave union flags in time to Rule Britannia after the Tory leader finishes his address to party conference are, let us give thanks, not typical of the British public. Behaviour which appeals to them, antagonises floating voters. John Redwood must know it. Yet, because of inner compulsion or convoluted calculation, he continues to offend the people the Conservatives need most. For Labour, the more often he broadcasts, the better. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "George W Bush's Texas leads the union in several key indicators of what compassionate conservatism has meant during his five years as governor: among them, the country's most densely populated jail system and its busiest death chamber. <p>He has signed more death warrants than any other governor, nearly one every other week since 1995. \"I'm confident that each person who has been executed in our state was guilty of the crime,\" he said. </p> <p>To that end, 141 people have been put to death during Bush's administration. Four weeks ago a man whose IQ was thought to be as low as 63 was executed, even though courts routinely consider anyone around 70 as retarded. </p> <p>Mr Bush can only issue a reprieve on the recommendation of the state board of paroles and pardons. He appoints its members, who have never met and vote by fax. </p> <p>Texas leads the US in its enthusiasm for locking people up: more than 163,000 of its population of 20m were in jail last year. </p> <p>While crime fell in the 90s in Texas - as elsewhere - the state's prison numbers grew by 173%; again, more than anywhere else. Indeed, between 1995 and 1998 crime in Texas declined by 5.1% compared with 10% nationally. </p> <p>\"Texas processes inmates the way a fast-food restaurant processes hamburgers,\" said Steven Bright, of the Southern Centre for Human Rights. </p> <p>Mr Bush, unlike his opponent Al Gore, opposes mandatory gun registration and adheres to the standard Republican line that the firearms laws are adequate but that the determination of the Clinton administration to enforce them is not. </p> <p>Guns are part of the Texan heritage and Mr Bush is not willing to tamper with that. He has signed a bill making it illegal for Texan cities to sue gunmakers unless the state attorney general agrees; declined to do anything to assist a bill that would have imposed background checks on people who buy guns at firearms shows; and supported a law that ended a 125-year ban on carrying concealed weapons.</p>",
  "Al Gore has made fewer campaign commitments than George W Bush on foreign affairs and defence, but then few American elections have been won and lost on foreign policy. <p>Mr Gore served in the US army in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971, though he was opposed to the war. Those years give him a credibility with the defence establishment which Bill Clinton never achieved. So also do his years in the Senate, in which he gained the reputation of a conscientious independent thinker on issues such as arms control. </p> <p>As America's commander-in-chief, he would not be so self-evidently a client of the military-industrial establishment as any Republican president - and certainly Mr Bush - would be. But Mr Gore is a defence hawk, and might favour more aggressive US military stances against opponents such as Iraq. </p> <p>Last month, after Mr Bush said in his Philadelphia nomination speech that US forces were demoralised, under-resourced and, in some cases, unready for action, Mr Gore mounted a fierce counter-attack, accusing Mr Bush of seeking to \"run down America's military for political advantage\". This seems to have discouraged further Republican efforts to make defence a major campaign issue. </p> <p>Mr Gore's position on the National Missile Defence System (NMD) is ambiguous. Officially, he supports the Clinton administration's plan to deploy a limited battery of interceptor missiles, and he has deliberately not attacked Mr Bush for his more ambitious views on the issue. But he is a proven believer in international arms control, and if he wanted to put the NMD issue on hold after he was elected he could do so, and would collect international acclaim for it. </p> <p>A Gore administration would have the traditional close relations with Europe, but the vice-president does not have the sentimental attachments to England or Ireland which made Bill Clinton a close ally of Tony Blair. </p> <p>He is probably closer to the Israel lobby than any Democratic presidential candidate in modern times, not least because of Mr Lieberman's presence on the ticket. </p> <p>European diplomats expect that a Gore administration would be tougher than Clinton's on trade issues. </p> <p>Mr Gore advocates free trade and the authority to negotiate fast-track trade agreements, but he has hinted at limits to free trade which would set him apart from Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"We must set standards to end child labour, to prevent the exploitation of workers, and the poisoning of the environment,\" he said last month. In the end, of course, it depends on what those standards are.</p>",
  "Few recent presidential contenders have challenged for the White House with less experience of defence and foreign affairs than George W Bush. But the son of an avowed \"foreign policy president\" has already surrounded himself with experienced counsellors from the Reagan and Bush Sr years who seem likely to guarantee a traditional Republican approach. <p>If Mr Bush becomes president his vice-president will be Dick Cheney, a former defence secretary. He would clearly like to make General Colin Powell his secretary of state. </p> <p>The former White House Russia adviser Condoleezza Rice seems to be earmarked for the job of national security adviser. Such veterans as Bob Zoellick, Paul Wolfowitz and the \"prince of darkness\", Richard Perle, are all poised for a comeback </p> <p>The Bush team is not united on every policy issue, but the Republicans are committed to a package which revives many of the preoccupations of the 1980s. These include increased military spending, expansion of the US weapons and missile programme, a more confront ational approach to China and Russia, and an unconstrained approach to free trade, though many policies from the Clinton years would remain unchanged too. </p> <p>Mr Bush has tried to make the poor morale of the US armed forces into a campaign issue, and he is committed to spending an extra $1bn a year on military pay, as well as \"refashioning our military\" with new equipment and weapons. </p> <p>Chief among these is the national missile defence system (NMD), which he wants to extend well beyond the limits currently under consideration by the Clinton administration. </p> <p>The Texas governor has said he supports sea- and space-based expansion of the land-based anti-missile system, a scheme which echoes the 1980s star wars project and raises issues with ramifications far beyond US borders. In the worst case, his version of NMD could sour relations with Russia and China, encourage a nuclear missile race between India and Pakistan, and create fresh tension in Nato and other US alliances. </p> <p>Like Mr Clinton eight years ago, Mr Bush would become a president committed to stopping \"endless deployments\" of US forces in international crisis zones. \"The deployment of our troops creates discontent among our soldiers,\" he said recently. \"We can't be all things to all people.\" </p> <p>Neither Mr Bush nor Mr Gore is an isolationist, but Mr Bush in particular intends to ration the extent to which the US becomes directly involved in peacekeeping measures around the world. He is on record as saying that there are no US interests at stake in Africa, and has made it clear that he would not have become involved in Somalia or, in a different regional context, East Timor. </p> <p>He would also try to set a date for US troops to be withdrawn from the Balkans, and would insist on \"exit strategies\" for future commitments. Ms Rice said earlier this year that a Bush administration would demand greater commitments and higher levels of defence spending by European countries. </p> <p>Mr Bush has said very little so far on Britain or Europe generally, but a Republican presidency would trigger a sharp change in relations between the Blair government and the White House after the closeness of the Clinton years - especially on missile defence.</p>",
  "Moving in together, setting up home or whatever cosy name you want to give it is, for most of us, a significant marker in the life of a relationship. Mutual domesticity has been universally regarded as a statement of commitment, an inevitable step in a serious relationship. <p>But according to Jan Trost, a sociologist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, a growing number of couples are opting out of moving in together. \"Living apart together\", as he calls it, is already a recognised phenomenon across Europe, where it's well-known by the acronym \"lat\". While there are no figures for Britain, the growing number of single-person households - currently 16% in England and Wales, with a projection of almost 50% by 2010 - suggests that many will be committed couples who choose not to share their space. </p> <p>Living apart can be the involuntary consequence of having high-flying careers, like the banking couple I know whose jobs have taken him to London and her to Zurich. They see each other at weekends, and admit it's less than ideal. But living separately is also an increasingly viable choice for people in the same city who simply don't want to explore the netherworld of shared toothpaste. Writer Margaret Drabble and her husband were married for over a decade before finally moving in together - and still insist on a show of independence by occupying different floors of the same house. Woody Allen and Mia Farrow famously had apartments within sight of each other across Central Park for years. </p> <p>Living together forces a rearrangement of the mental as well as physical furniture which some just don't want to negotiate. Living apart together, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily imply lack of commitment, but instead an acknowledgment of boundaries. The Posh and Becks model of extreme interdependence (where does she end and he begin?) may be the romantic ideal, but those who have opted for autonomy can't praise it enough. </p> <p>\"Two people might be mad about each other, but living together doesn't always feel like a natural progression,\" observes Karen Frayn, 28, a publisher in a three-year relationship with a co-worker. \"It wouldn't exactly be unbearable being in the same living space, but I want to be able to do exactly what I want, when I want. I want to be financially autonomous, and when you're on your own you can prioritise what you do with your money.\" For her, the biggest boon is \"getting to see what I'm like. Maybe it's a control-freak thing, but if I want to do something crazy to the bathroom or something, I can. I don't want to amalgamate personalities.\" </p> <p>Her sentiments are echoed by Helen Morris, a 34-year-old nurse, who met her current boyfriend when changing careers five years ago. \"Studying for my nursing exams took up 99% of my attention, and even though I loved him I knew I had to make something of myself. It was more important to me than the relationship. So moving in has never come up. I've never wanted to get married or have kids, so this is perfect for me.\" </p> <p>She admits that living together would be practical, as she's in a cramped studio flat and he owns a large house, but can't bring herself to compromise. \"I wouldn't want to have someone else's things around the house, and I can't bear anyone telling me how to live. People think that by living together they're going to be secure because someone's there looking after them, but it doesn't work that way.\" </p> <p>Denise Knowles of Relate, predicts that separate establishments will become increasingly common as women gain financial independence and have less incentive to split the rent. \"Women are putting more time and energy into business and haven't got as much energy to put into the domestic side. So they live alone, and when they do see their partner it's special.\" </p> <p>As a teenager, living with someone was a milestone that ranked up there with leaving home, and I couldn't wait to have a go. Any hygienic male would have done, but fortunately the first person to suggest it was someone I actually wanted to live with. But within a week of installing myself in his junior-sized flat, we knew it was a mistake. Cramming two adults plus assorted junk into three tiny rooms, though we persevered for a year, ruined the relationship. </p> <p>I've never tried it again. When another boyfriend suggested buying a place together a few years later, I was enticed by the idea of coming home to someone who knew me well, but realised I needed not just Virginia Woolf's room of one's own, but a whole flat. We ended up living separately for all our six years together, and I'd recommend it to anyone. You enjoy the pleasures of commitment without the boredom and bickering over bills, and if it ends, there's none of the trauma of buying each other out or splitting up possessions. </p> <p>This alternative to cohabitation also avoids what sociologist Patricia Morgan calls the \"rotten deal\" women get out of cohabiting. Her book, Marriage Lite, published last month, argues that living together without marriage is financially and emotionally disadvantageous for women - though she's not totally sold on living apart, either. \"You might get a better deal out of keeping your own home, I suppose,\" she concedes. \"It's like the aristocrats of the past, occupying separate wings. You'd get some of the advantages of marriage, but is it really commitment?\" </p> <p>My former boyfriend now wonders the same thing. \"If you don't live with someone, it makes the long-term prognosis less secure,\" he says. \"Living together means you might lose out on the thrill you feel when you only see someone occasionally, but you gain by getting to know each other better and having greater expectations for the relationship.\" It seems to be men rather than women who want the security of a shared address. \"Well, you do expect at some stage to live together, or you might live alone for the rest of your life,\" he says. </p> <p>It's a hard one to get right, as wanting separate places can be taken as a rejection. As Karen Frayn says: \"I was anxious that it might ruin the relationship, as he'd worry that I didn't care and didn't love him. He's been incredibly brilliant, but he does want us to live together in the end.\" Just so long as she's free to do what she likes with the bathroom.</p>",
  "<p>Rentokil Initial, the security guards to pest control group, is understood to be close to announcing the sale of its plant hire business to an unnamed buyer. </p> <p>The move comes in the wake of last week's badly received full-year figures. Chief executive Sir Clive Thompson will have to step down if the company fails to meet a new target for earnings growth of at least 8% annually and the proposed sale marks the latest attempt to refocus the sprawling group as a true businesses services specialist. </p> <p>Sir Clive has been keen to accelerate the group's restructuring, which he blames for a sharp slowdown in earnings growth, and he is likely to use news of the disposal as evidence that Rentokil has finally turned the corner. </p> <p>The plant division includes rented scaffolding, lifting equipment and specialist cranes used in the offshore industry. Its sale will help Rentokil meet a promise of raising some \u00a3600m from disposals before the end of the year. </p> <p>Sir Clive, who lost his \"Mr 20%\" soubriquet two years ago when growth faltered and who has watched his share price fall from 470p to a low of 116p over the past 18 months, has promised to spend the proceeds either on fresh acquisitions or on extending the group's share buy-back programme, which has already returned \u00a31bn to shareholders. The shares have subsequently recovered to 157p. </p> <p>He has refused to be anything other than upbeat on Rentokil's prospects, declaring his resignation from the presidency of the Confederation of British Industry in July as the point at which the \"fightback\" would begin. \"I see this as a born-again Rentokil,\" he said at last week's results presentation. </p> <p>But the City has remained wary of Sir Clive's chances of success, with several institutional fund managers privately calling for his early retirement after 18 years as the group's chief executive. Sir Clive is due to stand down in 2003.</p>",
  "The fourth hole of Freetown's golf course has long presented an interesting array of obstacles. A couple of years ago someone planted a landmine next to the \"brown\" - the sand substitute for a green. On Saturday, the challenge came from a machete-wielding man and two dogs in pursuit of a monkey for the pot. <p>Still, there is nowhere else for the diminishing band of golfers to play. The Freetown club is the last surviving of six courses once dotted around Sierra Leone. Most simply fell into disuse and disrepair as the nine-year-old civil war grew more brutal, and the expatriates fled in droves. The course at Yengema was dug up by miners in search of diamonds. </p> <p>The Freetown club house is a sad reflection of the country, but also of a budding optimism. Where once there were trophies now there are bullet holes after soldiers of the defunct military junta looted the place. The lists of trophy winners carefully painted on varnished boards come to a grinding halt in 1997, the year of the coup that marked another downturn in Sierra Leone's fate. </p> <p>The mine at the fourth hole was planted by soldiers of the former military junta who were resisting a Nigerian-led intervention force that reinstated the elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. The captured soldier who showed the Nigerians the mine was promptly shot for his trouble. </p> <p>After that the army used the course as a training ground. Still the club did not close. </p> <p>\"The only time we could play golf at that time was on a Sunday when they weren't training,\" said James Lebbie, Sierra Leone's most successful professional golfer. </p> <p>The war is not as intrusive as it was. The police have pitched a tent next to the eighth hole as a guardpost for the neighbouring road. It is less intimidating than the days when the Nigerians had a machine-gun post in the bunker. </p> <p>But membership has more than halved from a peak of about 250. Most of those who play today are expatriates, many serving with the United Nations. The Sierra Leoneans are generally \"drinking members\", who spend their time in the club house. </p> <p>Freetown golf club was founded by British colonists in 1904 and moved to its present location overlooking a glistening white beach 70 years ago. Sierra Leoneans were not permitted to join until independence in 1961. </p> <p>James Lebbie was not the first black player in the country but he is certainly its most renowned after a profitable career on the \"Safari Circuit\" of professional tournaments from South Africa to the former Zaire, Kenya and Nigeria. </p> <p>Mr Lebbie was drawn into golf as a caddie to earn pocket money. He started playing when he was 15 and two years later turned professional with the encouragement of two Scottish players at the Freetown club who helped to arrange sponsorship from a Scotch whisky distiller. </p> <p>He won the Sierra Leone open every year between 1985 and 1990, and was the first African to win the Nigerian open. But pride of place in Mr Lebbie's living room is a picture of him with Spain's Seve Ballesteros, a memento from when they were opponents in the first Africa versus Europe golf competition seven years ago. </p> <p>\"I made myself a bit of money. It was from golf that I built this house. I don't have any debts. I educated my kids. But for any professional now it is much more difficult. There are no sponsors any more,\" he said. </p> <p>But what optimism there is in Freetown is reflected in the golf club. Once it was a nine-hole course, then 12. Mr Lebbie redesigned it and raised the number of holes to 17. Some serve a dual purpose. Hole number five is a knockabout football pitch on a Sunday. </p> <p>None of this discourages the young caddies who are allowed to play on weekday mornings when the members are at work. Among them is 15-year-old James. </p> <p>\"Everyone says that this is a very difficult course because of all the problems we have. If I can be good here I will be able to win anywhere,\" he said. </p> <p>\u0095 More than a week after 11 British soldiers were kidnapped by a renegade military force, and days since half the group were freed, negotiations were continuing yesterday to gain the release of the six remaining soldiers, a British official said. </p> <p>Lieutenant Commander Tony Cramp, a spokesman for Britain's military force in Sierra Leone, said negotiators were in contact with the West Side Boys, the ill-disciplined army gang that seized the soldiers on August 25, but there was no prospect of immediate release.</p>",
  "In the debate about language tests for foreign doctors ('Knowing English does not make you a good doctor', September 2), some questions are mysteriously missing from the argument . <p>Why is the UK so heavily reliant on foreign doctors? Is it just a question of money? If so, Britain is paying the high price of putting patients at risk: in almost three years in this country I have seen enough appalling foreign doctors to justify this statement. </p> <p>While it is true that most overseas non-EU doctors speak English to a degree, their abilities are often merely academic. They might be able to discuss the latest papers in the BMJ, but they cannot communicate with patients because they cannot understand the everyday language. While Dr Shanmugadasan is right that speaking English well does not make you a good doctor, he overlooks one aspect that is very important in the doctor-patient relationship: the ability to relate to the socio-cultural background of patients. </p> <p>It is true that there is racism in the NHS, but it is not only the British who are guilty of it. I have seen departments with exclusively Asian consultants that will only employ other Asian doctors. The only white doctors were recruited through a rotation where the consultants had no influence. </p> <p>Therefore it is the EU doctors who find it most difficult obtaining a post, because there are very few German, Dutch or Spanish consultants who exercise control over who is employed. </p> <p><b>Dr Ralf Genthe</b> <br>(State Exam Berlin Medical School 1996) <br>Westcliff on Sea, Essex </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 The doctors quoted in your article might be excellent speakers of English, but on the evidence of their comments their comprehension skills are dangerously inadequate.

  "Al Gore has never uttered a more important sentence than the one which came just minutes into his presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last month. <p>\"I stand here tonight as my own man,\" Mr Gore told the delegates, \"and I want you to know me for who I truly am.\" </p> <p>After two terms as Bill Clinton's vice-president, the 52-year-old Al Gore is now two months away from becoming only the third man in American history to win the presidency at the end of an eight-year apprenticeship in the deputy's job. </p> <p>If he is to emulate Martin Van Buren and George Bush Sr, Mr Gore faces three tasks. He must define himself as his own man. He must tell America - and the world - what a Gore presidency would be like. And he must win an election which, until recently, he seemed likely to lose. </p> <p>Mr Gore seemed to stumble so often in the early months of the 2000 campaign because he was failing in the first two tasks. He has seemed anonymous - an occupational hazard for any vice-president - and too calculating. His political positions have seemed to owe more to fear and focus groups than to his principles. </p> <p>His lowest point came in early summer, when George W Bush seemed to be running away with the election. Afraid of losing Florida on November 7, Gore dithered on the Elian Gonzalez question, losing more support than he won in Florida and across the US. </p> <p>A month later, fearing that a run of high-profile executions in Bush's Texas might make capital punishment, which both candidates support, into an issue, Gore froze when an interviewer asked him if he would ever authorise the execution of a pregnant woman. That week, the Green nominee Ralph Nader reached the highest position he has yet achieved in the polls. </p> <p>Since then, Gore has fought to define himself - one of his catch phrases is that he is a \"principled fighter\". </p> <p>Nothing has helped him more than selecting Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate. From the moment the Democrats' fiercest critic of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky joined the ticket, Mr Gore recovered steadily in the opinion polls. </p> <p>Like Mr Lieberman and Mr Clinton, Mr Gore has a long record of centrist politics. All three men are on the right of the Democratic party, though all would insist that they are modernisers rather than conservatives. Mr Gore's record shows he is the most traditional Democrat of the three. </p> <p>As a congressman for eight years from 1976, and as a Tennessee senator between 1984 and 1992 - positions which his father held before him - Mr Gore was a classic \"cold war liberal\". He was pro-labour on government programmes at home, tough on foreign policy abroad, and in the middle on social issues like abortion. Mr Gore's speech to the convention this year was consistent with these positions. </p> <p>As with any US politician's legislative record, there are defining moments. In 1984, Mr Gore voted for a ban on federal education funds for school districts which discriminated against school prayer groups - a mark of the Baptist faith which repeatedly surfaces in Mr Gore's self-presentation. </p> <p>That was also the year that Mr Gore broke with many Democrats by voting to keep the MX missile programme, although he later voted for a nuclear freeze resolution. In 1990, Mr Gore was again in the minority of his party in voting to keep the B2 stealth bomber programme alive. </p> <p>Probably the most significant single vote Mr Gore ever cast came in 1991, when he voted in favour of the Gulf war in the senate, joining a mainly Republican majority to support action against Iraq. Even then, Gore went into the Senate with a gap in his speech where his decision - still unmade - would come. </p> <p>During his years on Capitol Hill, he laid out some of the stances most characteristic of his agenda. He may not have invented the internet, as he once appeared to claim, but he was unquestionably the most scientifically-minded senator of his era. No one on Capitol Hill has a better perception of the potentialities and problems of innovations such as biotechnology and superconductors - and none campaigned more intensively on threats to the environment. </p> <p>Perhaps the most significant shift in his thinking over the past decade has been from universalism to targeting in benefits policies. In 1988, when he first ran for the presidency, Mr Gore was a big government man, defending the traditional rationale for non-means-tested benefits. This year, in contrast to Mr Bush, targeting and incrementalism are the central themes of his tax and benefit proposals. </p> <p>On the broad canvas, a Gore presidency would represent continuity with the Clinton years, but his tone and instincts are more populist and class-conscious than Mr Clinton's. His appeal to \"working families\" may be focus group-tested, but it corresponds to a strong theme in Mr Gore's background, and could herald a retreat from some of the more overt \"third way\" approaches of the man he hopes to succeed.</p>",
  "Crime has been falling across the US for the past eight years, which dovetails conveniently with Al Gore's term as vice-president. <p>Many reasons for this are advanced - some of them overlapping: a virile economy, better police methods, an ageing population and the end of the crack cocaine epidemic are among them. </p> <p>But the US has deferred yesterday's problems until tomorrow: tougher sentencing means the nation's prisons contain a sizeable proportion of a generation that must be released at some point. </p> <p>The number of people in jail went above 2m last year, despite the slowest growth rate in crime in 20 years. The prison population has increased by 600,000 since 1990, fuelled by stricter sentencing policies, particularly against drug offenders. </p> <p>The rate of incarceration in the US is five times that of any country in Europe. </p> <p>In particular, while Mr Gore relies on the black vote to help him win the White House, the system is considered to discriminate against the African-American community, which account for 6% of the US population but 50 % of those behind bars and 42% of those on death row. One black American man in every 11 in their late 20s is serving a sentence of a year or more. </p> <p>Rev Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, said: \"We have 2m people in prison. That is an international scandal.\" </p> <p>Mr Gore at least pays lip service to the death penalty, in keeping with those Democrats who started to realise 20 years ago that opposition to executions was making them look weak on law and order. Support for the measure has fallen but still stands at 66%. </p> <p>The vice-president supports more stringent checks to keep guns away from criminals and 18 months ago he used his casting vote in the Senate to keep alive a bill aimed at doing just that. </p> <p>He said in his speech accepting the Democratic nomination that he would propose a victims' rights amendment to the constitution, granting victims of crime a guarantee that they can testify in trials and be notified when a criminal is being released from prison. </p> <p>Other initiatives promised by Mr Gore include 50,000 more community police officers and tougher penalties against those who misuse the internet to target children and compromise privacy. </p> <p><b>A prison state</b></p> <p>\u0095The number of people in jail went above 2m last year </p> <p>\u0095The US prison population has increased by 600,000 since 1990 </p> <p>\u0095African-Americans account for 6% of the US population but 50% of those behind bars </p> <p>\u0095One black American man in every 11 in their late 20s is serving a year or more </p> <p>\u0095Support for the death penalty stands at 66%</p>",
  "He is a tabloid hero - almost 300,000 Sun readers rang to protest against his murder conviction. For a few brief months his cause was responsible for the resuscitation of William Hague's leadership of the Conservative party. He even had Tony Blair writing secret memos worrying that the Government was losing touch. Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer found guilty of murdering teenage burglar Fred Barras, has become an icon of a malcontent Middle England. <p>The man I first met more than five months ago seemed an unlikely standard bearer. I had approached Martin's team with the idea of making a documentary about the case and was invited to meet the farmer in London. Pale, stout and dishevelled, limping into the office of his unpaid publicist, Max Clifford, he appeared more like a lost soul than a hero or a murderer. Amid the walled trophies of Clifford's campaigns past (David Mellor and the Chelsea strip, Gary Glitter and child porn) - in a world far removed from his rural home - one could not help feeling for this farmer in his 50s with his unkempt hair, muddy shoes and clipped well-to-do accent. </p> <p>Other factors suggested that this sympathy was not misplaced. In the absence of information from the police, initial press reports indicated that Martin had acted in self-defence. Death threats had been issued against him. He was living in a safe house hundreds of miles from his fenland farm. He apologised for his lateness, muttering that his situation was \"surreal\", like \"being hit by a tidal wave\". Taking a seat next to Clifford, his eyes darting around his surroundings like a hunted animal, one's initial response was that this was a victim. </p> <p>But Martin was angry. Over the next hour a stream of consciousness poured forth: he railed against the police for not protecting him; described a fenland world of \"pikies\" (travellers) who pillaged unhindered from farms; vilified a system that demonised anyone with the guts to stand up for themselves. He described his thrombosis (responsible for the limp), his run-down farm, his closest companions (three rottweilers), his love of travel, farming at night, his love of solitude. This disconnected rambling ranging across his life often returned to the first thing he had said that day; what was happening to him was surreal, beyond his control, not his responsibility. </p> <p>His version of events the night Barras died was simple. He was in his bed. He had heard noises downstairs. He took his shotgun and went to the top of the stairs. He was blinded by torchlight and, terrified, he shot into the darkness in terror. </p> <p>Although some of his views were distasteful and aggressively voiced, there was something about Martin that made one pity him. Not knowing the details of the case, one was tempted to ask why the charge against him was murder. Why had the police not accepted this as a case of self-defence or at most manslaughter? </p> <p>It was agreed that we would meet again, with his solicitor present, to film an interview before his trial. In the weeks that followed it seemed impossible to resolve the contradictions that had arisen from our initial meeting. He was at once the aggressive victim, the haunted pub philosopher, the gregarious loner. </p> <p>We went to his farm, Bleak House, to attempt to get more of a sense of the man. From the lane one could hardly make out the roof of Martin's home, so shrouded was it in trees. But the property was not only protected by the wood around it; Norfolk Police had posted a 24-hour guard on the farm. Press reports claimed the protection was necessary because of threats to Martin's property. It would later unfold that the guard was on the crime scene to preserve it for the judge and jury, an unprecedented step in a murder trial. The secrets of Bleak House and the light they would shed on Martin's character would have to wait until court. </p> <p>A week before his case was heard at Norwich Crown Court we met in a location close to the safe house that had been his home for the previous six months. He was in upbeat mood - he had finally been allowed his rottweillers back- but apprehensive about the forthcoming trial and the interview we were about to record. For legal reasons we could not discuss the night Barras died so we spoke about his life before and after the killing. </p> <p>We focused on the home he was defending the night of the shooting. He described the \"mantle of trees\" around the house, how he had created a \"rainforest\" for the wildlife, how he loved the naturalness and isolation of the gardens. But for all the love he expressed, there was the barb of fear. </p> <p>His trees protected him from the outside world but also made him vulnerable to its fears. It appeared as though Martin had retreated further and further into his private, 'natural' world but in doing so had become mistrustful to the point of paranoia. </p> <p>Another \"retreat\" he often made during the interview was to his childhood. \"I don't know why, I always go back to childhood, always. And since I've been in the situation that I am now, I suddenly start going back. I think childhood was great. I'd like to have stayed there.\" His tone had changed abruptly from wistful to assertive, bitter at the curse of his adult burden. But then he fell into reverie, recalling the summer days when he would walk across the fields to see his grandparents. In the middle of his reflection was a pause, then an almighty sob. As he forced back his tears, his hand massaging his throat almost as a garrote, he lamented the loss of his \"happy days\". This momentmade one reflect on his anger at the earlier meeting, on whether his understanding of his predicament as being \"surreal\", beyond his control, was due to a childish flight from any apportioned blame. </p> <p>At no point during our discussion did Martin express any feelings for the boy who had died that night. He was so bound up in his own world he could not see the glaring parallels between his own childhood lost in time, and the lost childhood of Barras, the boy he killed. Obsessed by what he had lost he focused on what he could still protect. He described how he had made Bleak House \"into a prison\" following a burglary in May 1999, how he had barred the widows and doors from the threat of the world outside. It was becoming clear that if Tony Martin's fear, paranoia and anger had been in such excess before the killing, were they not the cause of the burglar's death rather than the result of it? </p> <p>As Martin got up from his chair after the interview he turned swiftly to the assistant producer who was meeting him for the first time. \"So,\" he asked accusatively, \"am I a murderer?\" She said she didn't know, she hadn't heard the case against him. </p> <p>A week later the jury learned the other side of the story. They heard ballistics evidence that placed Martin not at the top of the stairs but in the same room as the burglars. They learned that Barras was hit three times by an illegal, pump-action shotgun; twice in the legs, once in the back. No warning shot was fired. No phone call was made to the police. The fatal shot was fired from 9-10ft and was consistent with the theory that the burglars were escaping when they were shot. In the words of Chief Inspector Martin Wright of Norfolk Police \"he just went up to these people and shot them\". In answer to Martin's question, they decided that yes, this had to be murder. </p> <p>\u0095 A Very British Murder: the case of Tony Martin is on C4 tommorow at 9pm.</p>",
  "The war of attrition between the hunts and the saboteurs escalated over the weekend when around 50 protesters wearing balaclavas attacked fox hound kennels in Surrey. <p>With the hunting season barely a week old, Friday saw a hunt saboteur airlifted to hospital after being hit by a Land Rover in what protesters claimed was a premeditated attack. </p> <p>And on Saturday police were called to the Old Surrey and Burstow Fox Hound Kennels at Felbridge, Surrey, shortly after 7.30pm, following reports of trespassers damaging the property. </p> <p>The manager of the kennels, Mark Bycroft, 29, whose pregnant wife and 15-month-old daughter were in one of three houses attacked, called the protesters \"anarchists\" who had no respect for \"women, children, property or animals\". </p> <p>\"Three vans and a Land Rover drove down the road towards the premises.

She was forced to hide at the back of the kennels,\" Mr Bycroft added. </p> <p>\"These people have no respect for anything. They are not just anti-hunting, they are anti-everything and have an absolute disregard for the law. They are quite happy to terrify women and children in their own homes at night.\" </p> <p>Surrey police, who had been called to the premises when the group began to meet at East Grinstead railway station, did not make any arrests but have begun a full investigation into the incident, during which officers used CS gas to disperse the group. </p> <p>A spokesman from the Hunt Saboteurs Association claimed the group had gone to the compound for a peaceful demonstration but had been attacked with pick-axe handles. </p> <p>The saboteurs claimed the demonstration had been sparked by a violent incident on Friday morning when a protester had been \"deliberately run-over\" by a hunt member as they met in Horsted Keynes, near Crawley, West Sussex. </p> <p>Steve Christmas, in his 30s and from the Haywards Heath area, was airlifted to hospital with a broken pelvis and ribs, and remains in intensive care. </p> <p>Dawn Preston, spokeswoman for the Hunt Saboteurs, claimed Mr Christmas was deliberately run down by an off-road vehicle as he protested against the hunt's meeting at Warren Farm, near Crawley. </p> <p>\"I believe [Saturday night's] action at the home of the hunt followed the deliberate attempt to seriously injure an animal rights activist,\" Ms Preston said. \"I am unaware of the full circumstances of the peaceful action, but I know there were no arrests.\" </p> <p>Last night Sussex police said a man had been arrested, interviewed and released on bail following the incident. </p> <p>A spokesman said the driver was not in any way connected with the hunt.</p>",
  "A 20-year-old woman remained in a critical condition last night after a fairground ride collapsed at an Australian agricultural show, injuring 37 people. <p>The Spin Dragon ride spun out of control at the Royal Adelaide Show on Saturday night, plunging eight metres (25ft), crushing many of its 40 passengers and seriously injuring others queuing for the ride. </p> <p>\"We were all standing behind a makeshift barrier at the front and, as the thing fell apart, we had nowhere to run,\" said Angus Sutherland, who was waiting with his son for a turn on the attraction. </p> <p>\"It looked like a war zone. Nobody took control, nobody was saying 'keep the crowd back' it was every man for himself,\" he added. </p> <p>Two of the victims were in a serious but stable condition, police said. Twenty-seven of the injured received hospital treatment. </p> <p>South Australia government safety inspectors examined the wreckage of the four-year-old ride yesterday, but said it was too early to determine the cause of its collapse. A preliminary report will be issued on Wednesday.</p>",
  "The UN's attempts to prosecute war criminals in Kosovo yesterday suffered a major setback following the escape of 15 Serb prisoners from a UN-run detention centre in the north of the province. <p>The fugitives, two of whom have been recaptured, are accused of crimes including genocide and mass murder. </p> <p>Nato-led peacekeeping troops set up road blocks and conducted house-to-house searches near the jail in the town of Mitrovice throughout Saturday night and Sunday. Sniffer dogs were used to check nearby woods. </p> <p>UN officials say the prisoners managed to escape after a gun was smuggled into the prison. The breakout was initiated late on Saturday night when a prisoner was allowed out of his cell to make a phone call. </p> <p>As a guard, a Nepalese policeman serving with the UN police force in Kosovo, returned him to the cell, other inmates brandishing a pistol hit him over the head. His keys were taken and the group released others from their cells. </p> <p>Three more guards, two Nepalese and one Indian, were overpowered and tied up. </p> <p>It took half an hour before the alarm was raised with K-For peacekeeping troops during which time 13 prisoners had scaled a fence and fled the detention centre unnoticed. </p> <p>The two recaptured inmates were arrested after they had returned to one of the cells to collect their belongings. </p> <p>The escape is the second involving Serbs accused of war crimes in less than two months and is a major embarrassment to the UN. </p> <p>The prosecution of war crimes is seen by Kosovo's majority Albanian population as highly important. The UN is setting a up a war and ethnic crimes court to deal with the issue. </p> <p>The remains of over 2,800 bodies have been recovered so far from mass graves in Kosovo, but not one war crimes trial has yet been completed. </p> <p>As the UN announced an internal investigation, it emerged that police had failed to increase security at the detention centre following the escape of three Serbs in July. </p> <p>The men, who were wanted for genocide and murder, escaped when they were being treated in a local Serb-run hospital. UN officials had suggested a special police unit would be deployed to bolster the number of guards in the prison, a measure that was not put into effect. </p> <p>William Nash, the United Nations administrator in Mitrovice, voiced his disbelief at the escape. \"It is hard to express the deep concern I have over this latest incident.\" </p> <p>He also implied that responsibility for the breakout lay with police in the province and denied the local UN administration was to blame. \"For our part we continue to focus on our duties and responsibilities,\" he said. </p> <p>The escape means that only 15 of the 26 people who had been charged with war crimes or genocide in Kosovo now remain in custody. </p> <p>The head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, met the head of the peacekeeping troops in the province, General Juan Ortuno, last night to review security measures. UN officials suggested that detainees may be transferred to another prison in Kosovo.</p>",
  "In an act of rebellion against the linguistic invasion that has overrun Poland since the fall of communism in 1989, a new law has been introduced to protect the Polish language. <p>The use of words such as \"sex shop\", \"supermarket\", \"music club\" and \"plaza\" have been effectively outlawed after the Polish language purity law came into force last month.</p> <p>Foreign languages are now banned from many aspects of day-to-day life in Poland unless translations are given alongside. A \"language police\" from the newly formed Polish language council will monitor progress. Those found to be violating the law could face heavy fines.</p> <p>During the draft stages of the bill, the extreme positions of many of those supporting it, particularly the right of centre populist Peasant's party, were clearly evident.</p> <p>\"They initially wanted to punish people for not conversing in Polish during private conversation,\" said Iwona Sledzinska-Katarasinska of the centrist Freedom Union, a philologist from the city of Lodz who introduced the bill. \"The law as it stands is much less radical than its founders wanted.\"</p> <p>Among issues initially debated were whether to allow proper nouns. \"Some seriously suggested that Johnnie Walker whisky should be renamed for the Polish market 'Jasio Wedrowniczek' (or Wandering Johnnie), and Tommy Hilfiger became 'Tomek Hilfiger',\" said Ms Sledzinska-Katarasinska.</p> <p>Although the new law has received widespread support in Poland - opinion polls suggested that 83% of the country's 40m inhabitants were in favour of such legislation - it has worried some business people.</p> <p>\"When capitalists marched in here 10 years ago they brought with them an army of words which filtered into the Polish language,\" said Lech, a 34-year-old accountant who works for an American company.</p> <p>\"Many of these cannot be translated into Polish because it's a very descriptive language and we would just get bogged down,\" he added, giving as examples \"due diligence\", \"venture capital\", \"private equity\", \"marketing\", \"computer\" and \"internet\".</p> <p>Lech and others, particularly those in marketing who will be hardest hit, complain that having to translate all documents into Polish will waste valuable time.</p> <p>\"It's natural for young Poles to use English words, particularly when they're more effective than the Polish equivalent,\" said Magda Nowak, a 27-year-old business development coordinator at a Warsaw-based venture capital company, citing \"email\" as a superior substitute for \"list elektronczny\" or \"electronic letter\".</p> <p>But supporters of the law say it is necessary to empower the consumer.</p> <p>\"Over the last 10 years, with foreign imports flooding in, a large proportion of the non-English speaking public have been excluded from knowing what was really on offer, and now they will be able to know in their language what is happening in their own country,\" says Wanda Samborska, spokeswoman for the Peasant's party.</p> <p>Passed at the same time as a broadcasting law that states that one-third of music played on radio stations must be Polish, the anti-\"Polglish\" law has led to comparisons with infamous French efforts to quash \"franglais\".</p> <p>According to the Polish daily Rzeczpospolita, diplomatic sources in Brussels have warned of stiff reprisals if Warsaw does not modify the new law, which it sees as a barrier to foreign companies wishing to set up in Poland.</p> <p>But, after two world wars and the dominance of German, followed by the repression wrought by decades of communism during which time people were forced to learn Russian, many Poles are happy that their language finally has a chance to thrive. </p> <p>\"We simply want to keep the language free from pollution and to send out a signal to people that their culture is being protected despite the increasing influences from outside,\" says Ms Sledzinska-Katarasinska.</p>",
  "Iran's conservatives, forging ahead on the back of a series of political triumphs, insist that they have no interest in relinquishing institutional power or compromise their beliefs to reach an accommodation with President Mohammad Khatami's reform movement. <p>In recent weeks they have flexed their muscles to demonstrate their strength: they have closed nearly all the reformist newspapers, imprisoned nearly all the prominent progressive journalists, and blocked a bill which could have freed the press. </p> <p>In his first interview with a foreign journalist, Hojatolislam Ruhollah Hosseinian, one of the most influential clerics in the conservative establishment, said his political camp was fighting to defend Islamic principles, which they believed to be under threat. </p> <p>Islamic vigilantes, backed by the conservative establishment, are also resurgent. Last week, they prevented two reformist religious intellectuals speaking in the town of Khorramabad in Lorestan province by cordoning off the airport. </p> <p>The incident led to five days of scattered street clashes between the vigilantes and democracy demonstrators, in which scores were injured and a policeman died. </p> <p>Hojatolislam Hosseinian, a mid-ranking cleric, said his supporters were fighting to build a country based on indirect democratic rule, in keeping with Islam. </p> <p>\"Just as democrats in the west come with various qualifications, such as Christian democrats ... so the word 'republic' has the same flexibility for us. This is a guided republic. You should not compare the Islamic Republic with western republics,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The reality is that our parliament is elected by the people. The president is elected by the people. The supreme leader is appointed by a body of experts who are elected by the people. The nature of our system requires supervision so it does not deviate from the Islamic framework. This supervision is given to the Guardian Council.\" </p> <p>The council consists of six conservative clerics and six Islamic jurists. Their job is to decide whether legislation conforms to Islamic law. In recent years they have been accused of exceeding their constitutional power and becoming an alternative parliament. </p> <p>Hojatolislam Hosseinian and a group of conservatives around him have been demonised by reformers for an alleged connection to political violence. They are accused of inspiring the murders of secular intellectuals in the 1990s. But they say they had no part in the murder plots. </p> <p>Sitting in the institution he runs, the Documentation Centre of the Islamic Revolution, Hojatolislam Hosseinian hardly fits the cardboard image that reformers have tried to attach to him. An educated cleric well-versed in Shi'ite theology, he presents reasoned arguments for his beliefs and those of the conservative establishment. </p> <p>He blasts the reformers for what he calls their absolutism and refusal to engage in constructive debate with conservatives. \"The reformers won't let people speak their minds. I am not afraid and I speak my mind, but many of my friends are too afraid to do so.\" </p> <p>For the first time in several years, the conservatives have taken clear control of their reformist rivals by exercising the vast power they hold in major institutions. </p> <p>The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the symbol of the conservative movement, took the unprecedented action earlier this month of ordering parliament to kill a bill which would have gone a long way toward reviving the press. </p> <p>His intervention was a shock to reformers, but was consistent with his pattern of direct intervention in political crises in the past several months. </p> <p>A series of similar manoeuvres by the conservatives has put them on top. The reform movement has been silenced in the parliament. </p> <p>President Khatami, the leader of reform, acknowledged two weeks ago in a two-part television address that his powers were limited. In the most revealing remarks of his three years in office, he vowed to fulfill his promises of political and social liberalisation but admitted that the conservatives had tied his hands. </p> <p>The reformers accuse the conservative clerics of trying to hold a monopoly on religious interpretation. They argue that this tendency departs from the purpose of Shi'ite Islam, which historically has tried to exist in a constant state of re-interpretation. </p> <p>Hojatolislam Hosseinian accuses the two intellectuals stopped at the Kharamabad airport, Abdolkarim Soroush and Mohsen Kadivar, of stretching the limits of interpretation to the point of apostasy. </p> <p>\"What we reject today are religious intellectuals. These people see the truth in terms of western ideas and try to justify religion on the basis of western ideas. We don't feel threatened by them, but we have our concerns. </p> <p>\"We believe Islam is an historical religion which can be adapted to all periods of time. But this ability toward innovation must come from within the faith. We consider it a miracle that Islam has the power to guide humans in all periods of time.\" </p> <p>The conservative establishment was determined not to allow the west to dictate Iran's future, he said. </p> <p>\"We do have a grudge against the west, and that is that they have never taken a scholarly approach to Islam and Shi'ite Islam, especially after the revolution. If they did, many issues would become clear to them.\"</p>",
  "<p>BODY BEAUTIFUL</p> <p>Imagine, Arsenal fans, that you were Dr Frankenstein. Imagine you had enough demonic power - and, of course, electricity - to create your perfect central defender. Obviously he would be big, strong and able to shoot his hand up for offside even in his sleep. That much goes without saying. And a penchant for near-post flick-ons and the West End play 'Art' would be nice too. Hang on a minute though, that's a perfect synthesis of Tony Adams and Steve Bould - and surely that's impossible! </p> <p>Well think again, because that defender already exists. His name is Igors Stepanovs, he's a Latvian international and - control yourself you Gooners - he's signed for Arsenal. \"Igors can definitely do a job in the Premiership. He is in the same mould as Tony Adams, which is why he will fit in so well at the Arsenal,\" said Graham Johnson, Latvia's English coach (who, in case you're wondering, used to manage Cambridge). \"The lad was magnificent against Scotland [at the weekend],\" Johnson went on. \"Steve Rowley [the Arsenal scout] was full of praise for the lad and thought there was a bit of Steve Bould in his game as well.\"</p> <p>That's some billing, and the 6ft 3ins centre-back could prove his worth as soon as this Wednesday. Because with Tony Adams out - reportedly for a month - and with a fresh-smelling work permit arriving at Highbury this very morning, Stepanovs looks likely to be hurled into the lions' den (well, Stamford Bridge). Not that Johnson, Stepanov's one-man fan club, is worried. \"I have told him if he plays like he did against Scotland in the Premiership he will soon be a millionaire in England,\" he twittered. But what will Stepanovs do with the money? Buy Lee Dixon's thigh muscles, we would wager.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>NOT-SO CLEVER TREVOR</p> <p>The Fiver loves the Sunday papers.

After all, where else could you read about the latest in light fittings, catch up with the movements of your local paedophile, get the recipe for a meal comprised entirely of artichokes, or read Birmingham City chairman David Sullivan having a pop at his manager, Trevor Francis, over two pages?</p> <p>Sky pundit Francis declared over the weekend that there is a conspiracy aimed at forcing him out of St Andrews. Sullivan told the Birmingham Sunday Mercury that Francis should stop talking like that, if he doesn't want to be forced out of the club. \"I would describe Trevor's reaction as paranoia,\" Sullivan said. \"His nature is one of pessimism. He paints a gloomy picture and has a policy of talking the team down. That way if we do badly he can say 'I told you so'. But if we do well he can tell us all what a wonderful manager he is.\"</p> <p>Francis, when not making Richard Keys look like an erudite afficionado of the game, has over the course of the past four seasons used porn magnate Sullivan's millions to steer the Blues away from promotion and acquire a complete collection of Mediocre Players \u0099. Not that Sullivan believes Francis would cut it even if he did make it to the Premiership. \"The task of staying there would be phenomenal and he might say 'I don't need this in my life',\" Sullivan said. So, all in all, a ringing endorsement. That Trev should just chill out - he'll do himself a misfortune.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>QUOTE OF THE DAY</p> <p>\"It's a lie.
