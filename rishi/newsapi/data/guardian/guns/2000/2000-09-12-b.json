  "<p>Ars\u00e9ne Wenger will not be booking flights for the final in Milan next May on the basis of this poor performance but at least it gave a perfect start to Arsenal's Champions League campaign thanks to a moment of magic from Silvinho. </p> <p> The Brazilian left-back scored another memorable goal to put Arsenal on course for the second phase, but they will have to do better than this to tread with the best. </p> <p> After two successive failures in the premier European club competition, a repetition is unthinkable for Arsenal. Yet they can hardly have expected such an easy ride against opponents who came into this match fresh from a fortnight's rest and with seven wins out of seven. </p> <p> Uppermost in Wenger's mind was avoiding defeat by the team he believes will vie with Arsenal for the second group place behind Lazio. There had been much evidence last season to build his confidence as his players had visited Fiorentina, Barcelona and Solna without defeat. Home form has tended to be their undoing. </p> <p> Arsenal's defence was still without the captain Tony Adams, but Wenger, who has said he will sign no more French players because it could upset the balance of the squad, was able to recall Patrick Vieira since the midfielder's five-game suspension applies only to domestic matches. </p> <p> Not surprisingly Vieira and his team-mates spent much of the early stages on the back foot in a 20,000-seat stadium, packed despite a quadrupling of admission prices for the occasion. Arsenal's tendency to concede possession hardly helped their cause, although Sparta seemed desperately to lack a cutting edge. When a mistake by Fredrik Ljungberg allowed Petr Papousek to present Marek Kincl with a clear sight of goal the striker sent his shot wildly off target. </p> <p> For a team usually so full of pace and vitality in attack, Arsenal began disappointingly. A free-kick by Thierry Henry never threatened to beat Tomas Postulka and when Ljungberg atoned for his sloppiness by curling a cross on to Henry's head, the Frenchman nodded wide. As the Arsenal players struggled to establish a rhythm Sparta grew in confidence, forcing several corners. From one Jiri Novotny brought out an instinctive from David Seaman with a header, but shortly after the half-hour a piece of Brazilian brilliance changed the direction of the match. </p> <p> There seemed no route to goal when Silvinho picked up a pass from Robert Pires near the left-hand edge of the penalty area. But the full-back expertly flicked the ball through his legs, manoeuvred it on to his favoured left foot and, after weaving past a couple of de fenders, he lifted a shot over the advancing Postulka, the ball creeping in via a post. </p> <p> If his goal against Chelsea was spectacularly explosive this effort was memorable for balance and skill. It gave the 26-year-old his third goal in as many matches and continued an impressive rate of scoring by Arsenal left-backs after Ashley Cole's strike at Bradford on Saturday. So much for the multimillion-pound strikers. </p> <p> Soon afterwards Nwankwo Kanu worked room on the edge of the area for a shot which Postulka palmed away. Although Arsenal occasionally looked unconvincing at the back, their grip on proceedings began to grow. </p> <p> A Jiri Movotany header, which drifted wide of the far post early in the second half, offered a reminder to Arsenal that the game was far from won and also provided the sig nal for a sustained spell of Sparta pressure which left Arsenal looking increasingly vulnerable. When Papousek's cross from the right found Kincl unmarked with only Seaman to beat, Wenger must have been grateful that the striker was again ponderous and that Martin Keown's strong challenge was deemed fair by the French referee. </p> <p> Vieira lunged to make an im portant block when a Seaman punch was returned by Joses Obajdin from the edge of the area, and then Papousek summed up Sparta's weakness by shooting into the side netting when Pavel Novotny allowed him a clear sight of goal. <strong>Sparta Prague (4-4-2):</strong> Postulka; Mynar (Flachbart, 85min), Bolf, J Novotny, Grygera; Papousek (Prohaszka, 79), Z Svoboda, P Novotny, Rosicky; Kincl (Siegl, 62), Obajdin. </p> <p><strong>Arsenal (4-4-2):</strong> Seaman; Dixon, Keown, Luzhny, Silvinho; Ljungberg (Vivas, 80), Grimandi, Vieira, Pires; Kanu, Henry (Wiltord, 77). Referee: G Veissi\u00e8re (France).</p>",
  "<p>Their name says it all. Arco, when written in a musical score, tells string players to use their bow rather than pluck with their fingers. To be gentle, not heavy-handed. So there will be no guitar smashing tonight, then. Not that the trio that takes to the odd surroundings of this tiny theatre look capable of such rock'n'roll behaviour. In fact Chris Healey, his identical twin Nick and Dave Milligan look more likely to refuse that overdraft you wanted. </p> <p>They wear quizzical expressions as they look about. The stage still bears traces of the play that is currently being performed on other weeknights: there are reflecting stars dangling from the ceiling and a metallic Polaris missile in one corner. </p> <p>\"Thanks for coming to this truly bizarre setting,\" Chris Healey says chirpily. \"I hope it won't be a bizarre evening.\" He settles in a chair, picks up his acoustic guitar and begins Speak, the opening track from Arco's upcoming debut album Coming to Terms, without any fuss. Chris sings this melancholy tale of failing love in a startlingly direct voice of uncomplicated woe. \"How can I speak, you've taken all the words, nothing to say, when you know you can't be heard,\" he sighs, as Milligan's McCartney-esque bass plods and Nick Healey barely taps the drums. </p> <p>This is low lo-fi: whispers of songs that are overheard for two minutes then fade away. But their brevity only adds to their power. The crowd - all 60 of us - wait for each note to disappear before daring to breathe and interrupt the awed silence. Which is strange considering the workmanlike approach the band themselves take. As they swap instruments and roam around the stage, Milligan with his bare feet and bowl haircut, Nick wearing his permanently glum expression, Chris jokes with the crowd and eases the intense atmosphere. \"Do you want the downbeat one or the really downbeat one?\" he smiles, gently playing another ode to heartbreak while his cohorts watch respectfully. </p> <p>He is very much in control of events, but a less likely frontman would be hard to find. Or a finer observer of human frailities, capturing that moment just before the sun comes up and the big questions get asked. But while the lyrics are sharp, the music floats, inducing a calm sleepiness as it flows. An hour in Arco's company is the aural equivalent of a day in a flotation tank. It may take a bit of getting used to but you will feel better in the end. </p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",
  "<p>Work begins in earnest today to find a replacement for the transfer fee and avoid the doomsday scenario of total abolition. </p> <p>A six-man panel called the Transfer Taskforce, with the European Commission breathing down their necks, will set about devising an alternative to the current system acceptable to Brussels. </p> <p>It will not be easy. The task force wants a formula which retains the benefits of of paying transfer fees for players under contract moving between clubs - redistribution of funds, contract stability and incentives for clubs to develop younger players - while avoiding the flaw: restriction of the free movement of labour required under European Union law. </p> <p>The deadline for proposals is October 31 and there will be further opportunity for discussions until the end of the year. </p> <p>Today in Brussels a taskforce delegation meets EC representatives to discuss the terms of engagement - broadly what will be acceptable and what will not. </p> <p>Tomorrow the whole taskforce will hold its first meeting at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, near Geneva, to discuss options and strategies. </p> <p>Gordon Taylor, a member of the taskforce as head of the European players' union Fipro, is particularly concerned about youth development. He wants to end all international transfers of players under 18 and a compensation system set up for the movement of players under 24. </p> <p>Hope is based on the encouraging signals from the EC recently that it is willing to treat sport as a special case under the Treaty of Rome. </p> <p>So what alternatives do the taskforce have to play with? Here are four possibilities. </p> <p><strong> Compensation</strong></p> <p> A rigid formula, similar to that proposed for players aged under 24, to set compensation to be paid by the buying club for a player instead of a transfer fee. The formula, written into the player's contract, would take into account elements such as the player's salary, the term remaining on his contract, time he has been with the club, age, experience (ie, international caps, first-team appearances, etc). </p> <p><strong> Buy-out clauses </strong></p> <p> A common practice on the continent, particularly in Spain. A player's contract will contain a clause stipulating the fee (agreed between player and club at the time that contract is signed) payable if another club wishes to recruit him. If that fee is met, then he is free to move - as in the case of Luis Figo when he recently moved from Barcelona to Real Madrid. </p> <p>Two difficulties arise: a player will want a buy-out fee that is as small as possible so it might be easily met and in some cases so there is more money available to raise his salary. But his club will want a high fee in the hope of deterring prospective purchasers or to maximise the player's value. </p> <p>This system is not, however, a solution to the problem of ensuring free movement. </p> <p>For instance, Rivaldo recently renegotiated his Barcelona contract, agreeing to a buy-out clause setting his next transfer at \u00a3106m. </p> <p>It is ludicrous to suggest this clause does anything other than restrict his freedom of movement; the fact he agreed to it does nothing to alter that proposition. </p> <p>So buy-outs would have to be capped or regulated, raising their own problems. </p> <p><strong> Loyalty bonus</strong></p> <p> One of the best ways to ensure loyalty is to buy it. Clubs could offer bonuses on top of salary, determined by length of service. </p> <p>For instance, executives in the City are often awarded substantial bonuses under \"long-term incentive plans\" whose payment is deferred for a set period of time. If the individual ceases employment, the bonus will not be paid. </p> <p>Such arrangements are a disincentive to move. The reality, however, is that, if the player is sufficiently in demand, then the prospective employer will often agree to compensate him for a lost bonus. </p> <p><strong> Central pot</strong></p> <p>The football associations of each European country would place a levy on their clubs, based perhaps on a proportion of each club's annual turnover. This central pot would then be used to compensate clubs who have lost players during the season based on an agreed formula. As a solution, however, this is an outsider, not least because of the inherent problems in administrating it. </p> <p> Nick Tsatsas is an employment lawyer with Clifford Chance Limited Liability Partnership</p>",
  "<p>A strange pyschology appears to be at work in Group D of the Champions League. Sturm Graz, the Austrian club who face Rangers in the opening match at Ibrox tonight, touched down in Glasgow yesterday with their coach Ivica Osim all but dismissing his team's chances. The only voice more imposing in terms of gloom has been that of Dick Advocaat, his opposite number at Rangers. </p> <p>Fretting over failure, and ever under pressure from club chairmen, perhaps managers feel compelled to highlight their own teams' deficiencies. Certainly Advocaat has been busy in recent days talking up the Austrians' experience in this arena; for a previously unsung club this is Sturm's third successive outing in the Champions League. </p> <p>Osim, by the same token, has lamented his inability to add to his squad before last month's European deadline. \"Rangers should have much more quality than us,\" he said, outdoing even Scottish pessimism. </p> <p>Despite some forlorn times in Europe which have helped Rangers keep their hubris in check, the truth is that the Scottish club should still have enough qualities to win. </p> <p>Anything less than victory will be a severe blow for a proud club who are already five points behind Celtic in the championship and saved only by leaky Montrose from having the worst defensive record in Scotland. After unremitting success Advocaat is facing his rockiest period since arriving at Rangers from PSV two years ago. </p> <p>\"Our preparations have not been ideal,\" said Advocaat. \"We've had to bring players back, such as Michael Mols and Artur Numan, who has only played two games so far, while Ronald de Boer has just joined us from Barcelona. Last season I'd say we were definitely better prepared because we had all our players who knew all their positions. We've been working hard on our routines.\" </p> <p>In the longer term Advocaat's chances rest upon some fragile ligaments. Mols, their prized Dutch striker who has been out for a year since injuring a knee against Bayern Munich, is restored to the squad though still feeling creaky after returning in the 1-1 draw against Dundee on Saturday. </p> <p>Mols is an exceptional player but the news yesterday that some fresh fluid has resurfaced on his knee will only add to suspicions about his fitness. </p> <p>Jorg Albertz, Bert Konterman and Barry Ferguson, who has been suspended from domestic duty, have all been added to the squad. </p> <p>\u0095 Kaiserslautern scored three late goals in seven minutes to secure a 3-1 victory over Bohemians in Dublin. Trevor Molloy almost started the evening in style, when he came close to scoring for the home side after 16 seconds, but he ended the evening in disgrace after a 43rd-minute red card for retaliation.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Loss of Confidential </strong><br> UK Confidential, the scourge of celebrities everywhere, has disappeared mysteriously from the pages of The Sun. The beautiful and acerbic Marina Hyde was escorted out of The Plant (that's Wapping to you) on Friday. No explanations are being offered by News International. But axing the best column in the paper so suddenly means something serious is afoot. Any takers? <strong>Update:</strong> The latest rumour is that Hyde has been offered a job on the News of the World, but no one there seems to know what it is.</p> <p><strong>Keeping abreast of the news</strong><br> Is it the Monkey's imagination or is the Sun's page 3 stunna Abby, 21, from Blackpool - last seen pouting clad only in a copy of the Guardian to celebrate National Cleavage Week - looking much better informed these days? </p> <p><strong>Brotherly love</strong> <br> As crack squads on the Sun and the Mirror prepare for the climax of Big Brother on Friday and Heat magazine plans an eight-page supplement on the occasion, there is one newspaper which could, if it wanted, outdo them all in the race for the best insider's insiders guide. Step forward the Sunday Telegraph. Kevin Myers, respected columnist at the Irish Times and the Sunday Telegraph, is used to writing about affairs of the nation. But reluctantly he has also found a very special link to Channel 4's cult TV show. Anna, little butter-wouldn't-melt-in-your-mouth Anna, is his sister in law. And by all accounts, Mr Myers is none too happy to talk about it. Shame. </p> <p><strong>What a relief</strong><br> Media Monkey feels duty-bound to report the latest unsavoury incident involving Sun TV reporter Emily Smith, despite concern that it may be accused of developing a Dominic Mohanesque obsession. Earlier this week Wee Smithy apparently ordered a cab from home to the press launch for Channel 5's fab new voyeur TV-fest, Jailbreak. After the cab showed up outside her abode, Smith gathered her things and headed out the door, only to be met by the sight of the cabbie - a woman - squatting to relieve herself in the front garden. The poor lass had obviously got all over-excited at the prospect of meeting the woman involved in THAT passionate public embrace with \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman.</p> <p><strong>Up front</strong><br>Prog rock band Marillion have taken a leaf out of Steven King's book and raised money via the internet to fund its next album. Why the band couldn't find a record label to provide the required funding is something of a mystery, but, undeterred by this apparent lack of faith, Marillion decided to email its 30,000 fan base asking for money with the threat that if it didn't get the money it wouldn't reward its steadfast fans with more fine melodies. How much did they raise? Get this - a whopping \u00a350,000. Of course the fans haven't just given the band the money, they've effectively bought the CD in advance. Clearly they were so blinded by Marillion's music that they've entrusted the band not to produce a pile of shite. Could Marillion have hit onto something? Perhaps if other bands followed Marillion's lead we could see the return of such fine acts as America teen sensation Tiffany.</p> <p><strong>Second Tuesday</strong><br>There's nothing like being an out-and-out copycat is there? You may recall the reason why First Tuesday is so called is because it holds events on the First Tuesday of every month. It's called stating the obvious because it's true, us internet types aren't that bright. Other networking groups have been a little more inventive - The Chemistry, The Ecademy and The Glasshouse for example - but none have been quite so bold as to pinch First Tuesday's inspirational idea, as First Monday, one of those it does-exactly-what-it-says-on-the-tin type of events - and absolutely nothing to do with First Tuesday. And it doesn't look like stopping there - a quick skinny though Net Names and it turns out that all variations of First and a day of the week have already been registered. Prepare to be inundated. </p> <p> <strong>Top banana</strong><br>A free banana to the correspondent from Wardour Street who's come up with the first response to Media Monkey's call for Big Brother tie-in ideas. Big Brother-branded prozac \"for when you know they're watching you\" we like; but the suggestion involving nipple cams is just not appropriate for a family-oriented diary column.</p> <p><strong>Bunch of Arse</strong><br>Always up for a good old crusade against hypocrisy, Media Monkey is indebted to the TV type who pointed out some shocking inconsistencies in Granada Media's net-busting deal to buy a piece of the famous Arse. After all, is this not the same Granada Media that was just recently arguing for the Carlton/United merger to be red-carded because it would cause a deplorable widening of the north-south media divide? Surely, following this logic, if Charlie Allen's Weatherfield Rovers mob are so committed to the north, they should be putting their wonga into say, Accrington Stanley, or Bradford Park Avenue? </p> <p><strong>What an offer, Hezza</strong><br> Michael Heseltine's generous offer to sell his book to staff at the knock-down price of \u00a310 has apparently met with a terrific response. So much so that Hezza has promised to sign every one personally. \"His generosity exceeds our wildest expectations,\" said a Haymarket source. </p> <p><strong>Jungle fever?</strong> <br> A memo went round Haymarket Publishing's offices today with the following unmissable offer for all Michael Heseltine's minions: \"Haymarket has a quantity of Michael Heseltine's book, \"Life in the Jungle\", published today, at the special price of \u00a310.\" The lines to Hezza's office must be jammed. <br></p> <p><strong>Wise words</strong> <br> Andrew Neil, speaking at the recent People and Profits in the New Economy conference: \"If you have trouble with recruitment and retention, then your company sucks.\" Could that be the same Andrew Neil who has recently had quite a lot of trouble with staff retention at the Scotsman? Your words, Andrew, not ours. <br></p> <p><strong>Mo better box</strong> <br> Word that retiring Labour MP St Mo of Mowlam is considering a TV career has got Media Monkey flicking through its contacts book in search of old broadcasting muckers who may be able to help out. The first call will undoubtedly be to the ITV Network Centre, where they are still a chief executive short of a full ITV Council. St Mo would be the ideal candidate - after all, she has plenty of experience of a job where people are always knifing you in the back. But Media Monkey would welcome other suggestions...</p> <p><strong>\"Nasty\" Nick snapped</strong> <br> Media Monkey is certain the Sun, as the official Big Brother newspaper, will be gagging to get its hands on some photos reportedly doing the rounds, which show \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman in his first public clinch with a member of the opposite sex since being evicted from the house of two-way mirrors. The offending snaps, taken outside the Met Bar after the TV Quick awards on Tuesday night (September 4), are said to feature Nick in a warm embrace with, er... go-getting Sun TV reporter Emily Smith. All in the line of duty, no doubt.</p> <p><strong>Sky's the limit</strong> <br> Does the low cunning of the BSkyB marketing department know no bounds? Imagine little Johnnie and Jemima's delight when, after a spot of bulletin reading courtesy of Sky News during their visit to the Millennium Dome, they are given a videotape of the performance to take home and treasure. Imagine their disappointment when, on getting home and watching the video, they have to sit through several minutes of trailers for Sky TV services before glimpsing their brief moment of fame. Fiendishly clever. </p> <p><strong>A few Choice words</strong> <br> The dirtiest catfight in telly, Terry Wogan v Stuart Murphy, splutters on in the letters column of BBC in-house organ Ariel. You may recall that in a letter to Ariel last week, BBC Choice head honcho Murphy launched a stout defence of the BBC following La Wogan's recent attack on the corporation, telling him he was \"living in a bizarre fantasy world of an Auntie's Bloomers script\". This week in Ariel, BBC broadcasting and presentation staffers Mark Thomas and Christina Dunley leapt to Wogan's defence, accusing Murphy of \"wanting us to work for a Stalinist BBC where employees dare not utter any criticism of their masters\". The pair conclude: \"Let's face it Stuart, Choice has never delivered on the promise of its name... the sooner BBC3 rises from its ashes the better.\" Miaow!</p> <p><strong>Don't talk at Talk</strong><br> The queen of New York publishing, Tina Brown, is giving Brits abroad a bad name. Staff members at Talk magazine have been told not to approach Ms Brown directly with ideas or questions, as their input is \"driving her crazy\". New York magazine reports gleefully that the new rule is that editorial director [Bob Wallace] or his direct underling [Perry van der Meer] must filter Tina's traffic. Wallace disputes the account, saying that while Van der Meer -- who worked under Brown at The New Yorker -- was brought in recently to streamline the editorial process, \"anyone can still come to Tina and me or e-mail us at any time about any issue. And believe me, they do.\" The New York Times' source notes sorrowfully: \"No one wants to hear that they're driving their boss crazy.\" Ms Brown is in England on holiday.</p> <p><strong>Croaky name?</strong><br> It's official: advertising agency names are getting sillier. First there was Mother - the trendy, Clerkenwell-based agency that looks after Harvey Nichols and Hoegaarden Beer. Then the disgraced political lobbyist Derek Draper launched an ad agency and mysteriously decided to call it Farm. Now Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse - a company that's surely old enough to know better - has appointed an agency called Strawberry Frog to handle its ads. It makes you long for the good old days, when adland was full of egotists who called their agencies after themselves, and had done with it.</p> <p><strong>A little unfortunate</strong><br> Marks &amp; Spencer has been trying to do its bit for normal women by using unusually curvaceous models (to put it politely) in its new ad campaign. So it was unfortunate that only the day before the distinctly uncurvy Tara Palmer-Tomkinson appeared on the front page of the Daily Mail as the new face of Splendour.com - a lingerie-selling website in which M&amp;S has a stake. A small case of double standards, perhaps?</p> <p><strong>No small beer</strong><br> Far be it from us to suggest that anyone in advertising takes the whole business of making ads too seriously. But the reaction of Heineken international marketing manager Frazer Thompson to the French ban on alcohol ads may have been a little extreme. \"In France the world has gone dark,\" said a grief-stricken Thompson. </p> <p>Email the Media Monkey at <a href=\"mailto:monkey@mediatheguardian.com\">Monkey@mediatheguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Since manifesto time is coming round again, I took down my fading copy of Let Us Face the Future, the manifesto I drafted 55 years ago for the 1945 election when I was secretary of Labour's policy committee. I remember it was an easy job, all there already in Mr Attlee's head, in Mr Morrison's head, and in mine. After all this time, is anything at all from it still relevant? <p>No on the detail. But on two of the principles, perhaps yes. The first principle was of public service, the second of equity in the distribution of income. In the good society every citizen contributes to the wellbeing of the city, not because they want to get some special gain out of it for themselves as individuals but because they love the city. The ideal was public service in voluntary work, and above all in the public services like local government or in essential industries such as water, electricity, fuel and railways. </p> <p>The current government has for the moment thrown the first principle overboard. Public servants have not been given any special credit or recognition by the government. Rather the reverse - teachers have become the butts of criticism, social workers have not done much better, and even doctors and nurses have not escaped obloquy altogether. </p> <p>Of all the professions, teachers have been the hardest hit by the liability of being named and shamed by the government which employs them to teach and do paperwork. Regular testing of children has been taken to greater lengths than ever before, and all the testing also identifies the teachers who are behind the children. The nationally published league tables of test and exam results show which schools are under threat. </p> <p>The Ofsted inspectors are a greater imposition on teachers than the testing. Even the most experienced teachers quail before the inspectors, behind them always looming the figure of Chris Woodhead, HM Chief Inspector and hammer of the teachers. The naming and shaming also makes it more difficult to recruit new teachers. </p> <p>If the public service \"fails\", always ready to take over any school is what the government seems to believe is an organisation inherently superior by reason of being commercial. Even whole local education authorities can go the same way when they also \"fail\", as Leeds and others were adjudged by Ofsted to have done. </p> <p>LEAs may be particularly vulnerable but the rest of local government is not much safer. There is talk in Whitehall of abolishing local authorities altogether, even though the thrust of devolution which has taken in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales would then peter out before it reaches any really local community. It would be Whitehall to the front again but loaded with the truly impossible task of governing every little bit of each nation from the centre. </p> <p>The old-fashioned nationalised industries would have had a much better chance if the Treasury had not insisted on keeping them under detailed financial control. To re-nationalise the railways without Treasury control would be better than putting up for ever with the botched job Mr Major left behind him. Why are air traffic control and part of London Underground still being threatened by privatisation? The public services have a special advantage when safety is paramount. </p> <p>We also need to get way from the notion that public ownership has to mean state ownership. It can also mean ownership by employees (as with the John Lewis Partnership) or by consumers, like the two mutuals owned by members or policy-holders - Nationwide as a building society and Standard Life as an insurer - which are in this very year battling for their lives against carpetbaggers but with no help from the government. </p> <p>The deeper problem is that the government cannot any longer have it both ways. Thankfully, they have committed themselves to higher expenditure and higher standards in education and the NHS. If they are to succeed, and they must, for best value the morale of the people they employ must be raised. The government needs to pipe down on the criticism. Learn to praise. Recognise. Appreciate. </p> <p>When we turn to the other of those earlier manifesto principles, equality, it is worth remembering that 1945 was followed for nearly 30 years by what has been called a golden age. There was generally full employment without inflation, growth in the economy, and (the specifically socialist contribution) there was a relatively equal society. All this came to a rather abrupt end and, particularly since the early 1980s, there has been a reversal. In particular, unemployment has been higher and inequality has increased by leaps and bounds. </p> <p> The government has begun to lift up the people at the bottom. The New Deal has trained some young people in skills which are going to become more than ever necessary in a more globalised economy. The working families tax credit has made life a bit more bearable for families on low wages. A large number of children have been raised out of poverty. But not enough. When (and if) the target is reached for child poverty in 2002, child poverty will still be nearly twice as high as when a Labour government was last in office, in 1979. </p> <p>Something has been done and much promised for people at the bottom of the heap, and very little or nothing at the top end. The richer have not been called on to make any sacrifice themselves. To judge from what ministers say, poverty is not a taboo word but equality and redistribution are nearly so. Nothing much has been said about the ballooning out of income and wealth towards the top, and the extent to which this has added to inequality. The norms which used to be accepted across Britain and which used to check earned incomes at the top no longer prevail. </p> <p>According to a recent Guardian survey the pay of Britain's top businessmen went up by 16.5% in 1999, four times the average wage increase. The increase was from an elevated base. More than 110 senior executives (including one woman) received more than \u00a31m a year in basic income. Some basic! This was without counting share options with their tax advantages. </p> <p>The government has done nothing about the opulence of the rewards which directors are granting themselves. If the government is to earn a reputation as a government of social reform it will need to loosen its alliance with capitalism and remember not only Attlee but also Lloyd George. The Liberal government of 1905 not only benefited the poor through the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908 and the National Insurance Act of 1911, but was also spirited enough to call on wealthier people to make their contribution. The Liberal \"People's Budget\" introduced the first supertax. </p> <p>The conclusions: restore the pride of people in the public services and tax the rich. The ghost of Let Us Face the Future is not yet laid to rest. </p> <p>\u0095 Lord Young of Dartington is the originator of the Consumers' Association and the Open University.

  "Chechen rebels yesterday shot and wounded a top Russian general and killed six other soldiers in a series of ambushes in Russian-held areas of the republic. <p>Demonstrating their ability to strike behind Russian lines, the rebels shot up Major General Anatoly Mikh's car on yesterday on the outskirts of Gudermes, headquarters of Chechnya's pro-Russian administration. Mikh was hit by five bullets, and his driver and an officer were wounded, a Russian official said. </p> <p>The attack in an area supposedly under firm Russian control will be another major embarrassment for the Russian military, which has claimed repeatedly that the rebels are defeated and pose no major threat.</p> <p>Lieutenant General Ivan Babichev, chief military commandant of Chechnya, said the attack on Major General Mikh was motivated by Russian efforts to stop theft of oil from pipelines crossing Chechnya.

  "<p>After the Guardian's revamp last year, the Scotsman's a few months ago and now the Telegraph, it's broadsheet redesign season. </p> <p>Similar aims (to respond to falling broadsheet circulations and competition from other media) and opportunities (more colour, more flexible page make-up systems) will lead inevitably to similar solutions. But it is fascinating how firmly the formula is becoming established. </p> <p>Here are some elements of the contemporary broadsheet redesign: cleaner, more elegant teaser panels with light background; supporting sans-serif font for labelling and feature display (preferably Interstate from the Font Bureau in Boston); ranged-left headlines (perhaps slightly smaller down page than previously); extended contents panel/summary on columns one and two of page two; and more assertive folios/section openers. The Telegraph closely follows the paradigm. </p> <p>The Scotsman and Telegraph shared the problem of introducing a crisper, more modern look (without alienating readers) to papers still based on the traditions of British newspaper typography that the Guardian abandoned with David Hillman's redesign in the 80s. Both now look more like European papers than would have seemed possible a few years ago.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about the Telegraph redesign is what hasn't changed. The title piece, headline font and use of bastard measures remain. And unlike the Guardian and Scotsman, which both introduced a slightly bigger, more readable body type, little or no work seems to have been done on the text.</p> <p>Most strikingly, the Telegraph has resisted the temptation, to which the Times and Scotsman succumbed this year, to introduce a standalone tabloid features section. </p> <p>Perhaps Telegraph readers are not ready for drastic change. In the light of this, the recent changes must be deemed a success. </p>",
  "<p>The first thing that strikes you about the new-look Daily Telegraph is the much tidier front page. </p> <p>The radical decision to move the flannel panel to above the masthead and ditch the blue background strip is a huge - yet disputable - step-change for the Telegraph. </p> <p>Many stalwarts are divided about its benefits. The only other broadsheet to have its flannel panel above its masthead is the Independent, but then the Independent still has the conventional blue strip, while the Telegraph has opted for an all-white background. </p> <p>The new colour, a kind of beige, bears an uncanny resemblance to the one The Guardian uses on its flannel panel. The index strip down the left-hand side of page two could also be said to be inspired by the Guardian, except for the fact that the Telegraph's index does not have a tint. </p> <p>Other changes are more subtle. While it looks like there are a hell of a lot more picture bylines, a quick count reveals there are the same amount. The difference is that they are more scattered throughout the paper. And the first one appears on page 10, as opposed to page 18 last week.</p> <p>The overall impression is that the Telegraph is trying to be trendy and appeal to younger audiences. But, as seen with the wide array of fonts used on the front page, it is not entirely consistent. </p> <p>The mixture of serif and sans serif fonts makes the paper look a little confused, to say the least. The look is not dissimilar to the one it revealed a few months back when Dotcom.telegraph was launched. </p>",
  "The highly regarded B-movie film director, Joseph H Lewis, who has died aged 100, was born in New York. The year? It was either 1900 or 1907, with the earlier date most favoured by reference books, the American Film Institute and British Film Institute. However, the later date has gained credibility, with the suggestion that Lewis added years to his age on entering the movie business in the hope of gaining a more senior post. <p>In fact, he joined MGM as a camera loader in the early 1920s, either as a teenager or aged 23. He stayed in the business until the late 1960s, latterly working in television. His career as a movie director lasted just 21 years from 1937, and, during that period, he also served in the US Army Signal Corps. He directed more than 40 films. </p> <p>All except one of these were B-movies, often destined for the lower half of double bills. As his career progressed, Lewis moved to bigger budgets, but still directed genre flicks, considered at the time to be run-of-the-mill thrillers or westerns. His film career ended in 1958, as Hollywood, battling the inroads of television, turned increasingly to the wide screen and blockbusters, and the double bill became obsolete. </p> <p>The style of film at which Lewis had excelled became the staple diet of television - action and genre pieces to fill the greedy air waves instead of local cinemas. For 10 years, he joined the enemy, working on the Lloyd Bridges Show, the Zane Grey Theatre and A Man Called Shenandoah. He directed the pilot of Branded in 1965, and episodes of such popular series as Gunsmoke, The Big Valley, Law Of The Plainsman and The Rifleman. His television work remains a coda to his busy, central years as a film director. </p> <p>After his retirement, Lewis, like other B-directors, was lionised by the French, and later by American, British and other critics. Many of his quickly-made works were reassessed. In the US, Paul Schrader helped influence his new-found reputation - largely based on one classic - and there were retrospectives of his career mounted, not least at the National Film Theatre, where Lewis also took part in a Guardian lecture. He proved himself exactly the amiable, tough, no-nonsense professional that his works suggest. </p> <p>Over the years, the works have resurfaced on television, on 16mm and in various retrospectives. Those on view confirm that there are indeed a handful of memorable films, plus a whole series of intelligent, entertaining works - mainly westerns. The rest remain in decent obscurity, although contemporary reviews invariably praise their originality, economy and ingenious camerawork. Lewis was no slouch. </p> <p>But, as the critic and film historian David Thomson remarked, \"There is no point in overpraising Lewis.\" He worked with limited resources, often with middling actors, on series product offering mundane scripts. He transcended the material - but his liveliness and technical skill only highlight the paucity of the material with which he worked. </p> <p>Still, we do not need to overpraise him to realise that, on occasion, he created small, beautifully crafted cinema. And a handful of these films are complex works that stand up infinitely better than the grandiose, over-blown epics that were the result of his fellow directors' move into A-features. The often flabby films of the 1960s and 1970s were a riposte to the undernourished budgets of television. At the time, they seemed a valid alternative; today, less so. </p> <p> After Lewis entered the studios, he stayed there for some 16 years in a variety of jobs. He worked as an assistant editor, second unit director and supervising editor on many films, including In Old Santa F\u00e9 (1934) and Ladies Crave Excitement (1935), as well as on popular 12- or 15-episode serials, such as Undersea Kingdom (1936). In that year, he also edited The Devil On Horseback, directed by Crane Wilbur, and, in 1937, co-directed Navy Spy, with Wilbur. After years of sturdy, invaluable experience, Lewis had graduated and, again in 1937, directed his d\u00e9but, Courage Of The West, quickly followed by Singing Outlaw. </p> <p>He made three films in 1938, including Border Wolves, described as a \"visual treat\". Within the next three years, he had notched up another dozen B-movies, mainly westerns such as The Man From Tumbleweeds (1940), and three films from the East End Kids series - Boys Of The City, That Gang Of Mine and Pride Of The Bowery. This busy pattern continued with product from studios more interested in quota than quality. The titles tell most of the story - such as Bombs Over Burma and Criminals Within. Among these mainly action pictures was an odd biopic, Minstrel Man (1944), about and starring Benny Fields. The following year, he directed a lively offering in the detective series, The Falcon, in San Francisco. </p> <p>Also in 1945, Lewis made his real breakthrough. My Name Is Julia Ross was his 25th directorial credit, and probably his best movie to that date. It is a brisk, slightly loopy example of film noir about a secretary (Nina Foch) who is kidnapped and held in a remote mansion by a demented boy (George Macready) and his mother (Dame May Whitty). It is not too fanciful to view this little chiller as a precursor to Hitchcock's masterly Psycho. </p> <p>Lewis followed this with another melodramatic thriller, So Dark The Night. He was now working for Columbia, the least of the major studios, but still more prestigious than his earlier employers. They gave him the task (probably because of Minstrel Man) of directing the musical numbers for the highly successful biopic, The Jolson Story. But the main credit went to Alfred E Green, and Lewis returned to B-pictures, working with the star of Jolson, Larry Parks, on The Swordsman. </p> <p>In 1948, he made The Return Of October, before returning to better form with a stylish and stylised crime story, Undercover Alan (1949), which led on to one of two acknowledged masterworks, Gun Crazy (1949). This is often compared favourably with Bonnie And Clyde, although in truth it is a noir gem best ranked with Nicholas Ray's They Live By Night. The story, of a doomed couple, plunged headlong into crime by an obsessional amour fou , is completely unsentimental. It is distinguished by fluid camera work, two brilliant set-piece robberies, and the driven performances of the young leads, John Dall and Peggy Cummins. The tragic ending closes the circular narrative as the non-violent hero fires blindly at the police and dies by the guns he has coveted as a small boy. </p> <p>The acclaim that turned Gun Crazy into a cult movie came much later, and Lewis continued with B-movies, although with technicians and actors of a higher calibre. His next work was an excellent melodrama, Lady With A Passport (1950), starring Hedy Lamarr, followed by the Korean-set war film, Retreat Hell! and Desperate Search (both 1952) and Cry Of The Hunted (1953). </p> <p>His subsequent film, The Big Combo (1954) has less of a reputation than Gun Crazy, but boasts even more distinguished camerawork (by the great John Alton) and a remarkable trio of heavyweight actors - Richard Conte, Brian Donleavy and Cornel Wilde. This claustrophobic, violent movie is superbly structured, and remains today a dark and cynical work. It is probably Lewis's most achieved and complex film. </p> <p>Apart from a short, Man On A Bus (1955), made for the United Jewish Appeal Fund, Lewis made only four more feature films before moving into television. Of these, 7th Cavalry (1956) is a modest western, starring Randolph Scott. Although not in the same league as the Scott-Boetticher westerns, it is an attractive, melancholy work. </p> <p>The remaining trio are rather more notable. A Lawless Street (1955) is distinguished by characteristically agile camerawork and a brisk narrative. The Halliday Brand (1957) is a psychological western with a dark tone, offering themes of racism, humiliation and an obsessive family. As usual, Lewis transcends his limited budget with visual flair and energy. </p> <p> T he following year, he directed Terror In A Texas Town, an attempt at an artistic wilful example of the genre. This odd western boasts an almost surreal climax as the hero, Sterling Hayden, seeks revenge, using his dead father's harpoon as a weapon of destruction. It was a flamboyant end to a film career that led to him becoming one of the most discussed of all B-movie directors. </p> <p>His best work stands alongside that of Edgar Ulmer, Budd Boetticher and Jacques Tourneur, as well as the earlier, better films of Edward Dmytryk, Blake Edwards and Richard Fleischer - before they and others allowed inflated budgets to inflate their egos and bank balances whilst deflating their talents. And while agreeing with Thomson that we should not overrate Lewis, we certainly need never underrate him and his like. There was an integrity, energy and skill that makes such craftsmen key figures in the history of popular crime films. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Buena, and a daughter, Candy. </p> <p>\u0095 Joseph H Lewis, film and television director, born April 6 1900; died August 30 2000</p>",
  "<p>Scoot is understood to be preparing to hand over to regulators a legal dossier containing allegations of a long-running smear campaign. </p> <p>The document, which has been prepared by City law firm Charles Russell over the past five months, is believed to have identified a disgruntled former employee as the source of negative stories that have dogged the internet directory firm since the start of the year. </p> <p>Many of the reports stemmed from a file that contains allegations about the company and was circulated anonymously to newspapers. When the allegations first surfaced, Scoot chief executive Robert Bonnier said they would be investigated fully and, although he was not interested in a \"witch-hunt\", the authorities would be informed of the result. </p> <p>It is thought that the document is likely to be passed to the serious fraud office and financial services authority, and could result in a criminal investigation. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned that lawyers from Charles Russell were in the high court last Monday on behalf of Scoot, attempting to extract information from potential witnesses to the smear campaign. </p> <p>During those proceedings the law firm told the court that its client was in \"advanced takeover talks\", just hours before Scoot issued a stock exchange statement denying reports of a takeover bid. </p> <p>Charles Russell said yesterday that the information was wrong and issued in error. </p> <p>\"An incorrect statement was made in court proceedings,\" a spokesman said. \"The court has been informed and the statement corrected. The UK listing authorities have been informed accordingly.\" </p> <p>Scoot last night denied reports that the FSA planned to investigate the circumstances surrounding the takeover story and the legal mix-up, although Charles Russell said it would cooperate fully if asked to take part in any further inquiries. </p> <p>Mr Bonnier said: \"This has been a major embarrassment on Charles Russell's behalf and they have tried to rectify it as soon as possible. We just want to get on with building this business, which goes from strength to strength. </p> <p>\"People are going to see some incredible things in the future which will be value-creating.\" </p> <p>Dealers have complained that last week's rumours that a French conglomerate was about to take over Scoot and the subsequent 60% jump in the company's share price created a false market before the story was denied. </p> <p>Mr Bonnier insisted that Scoot and its advisers had done their best to clarify the situation as soon as possible. \"If anyone adheres to regulatory and fiduciary duties it's Scoot.\" Mr Bonnier had hired private detectives to track down the source of a series of price-sensitive leaks. </p> <p>Shares in Scoot fell 12.25p to 148p yesterday after a weekend of negative press reports. There were claims that some investors have been aggressively selling the stock short and that individuals offshore have been conducting a campaign against Scoot. </p> <p>A spokesman for the FSA confirmed it had received a complaint about the events surrounding last week's share price movement. </p> <p>\"We have received a letter and, in general, if there's evidence of a breach of the listing rules we would look into it,\" he said. </p> <p>When asked if the allegations against Scoot had been dismissed by the FSA, he said: \"We have not discussed in public whether we are reviewing the circumstances surrounding Scoot and therefore can't comment on any action we might be taking.\"</p>",

  "<p>Anti-smoking ads really do help people to kick the habit, according to research published today.</p> <p>Smokers in regions where anti-smoking ads were broadcast were more than 50% more likely to succeed in giving up than those in areas where there was no campaign, according to a study by the journal Tobacco Control.</p> <p>Researchers assessed the impact of an 18-month TV campaign conducted by the now-defunct Health Education Authority between 1992 and 1994. The ads, which starred John Cleese, were designed to motivate people to stop smoking and were broadcast in the Tyne Tees, Yorkshire and Granada regions.</p> <p>The researchers then compared the rate of quitting smoking in those regions with the Central area, where the campaign was not broadcast. They found that in areas where the ads ran, 7.45% of smokers quit the habit, and only 3.3% of ex-smokers lapsed, while in the Central region 5% quit and 5% of ex-smokers relapsed over an 18-month period.</p> <p>The net effect of the campaign, which cost \u00a312.5 million, was to reduce adult smoking by about 1.2%. The researchers concluded that TV campaigns were \"highly cost-effective\" compared with the huge burden placed on the NHS by smoking-related diseases.</p>",
  "Ministers were last night pressing police and oil companies to break the blockade of refineries and fuel distribution depots by road hauliers and farmers as Britain faced its worst picketing crisis since the miners' strike 15 years ago. <p>With panic-buying closing hundreds of filling stations around Britain, rationing in force in many areas and emergency services restricting all but essential calls, Tony Blair hardened his line by calling on the home secretary, Jack Straw, to ensure that extra police will be available. </p> <p>Rejecting calls from petrol retailers for a reduction in fuel duty, Downing Street made clear that additional forces were necessary to protect delivery drivers from intimidation and keep supplies running to station forecourts. </p> <p>But hopes that the world price of oil would soon fall were dealt a blow last night. Even higher prices could be in store soon after world markets ignored a weekend promise by oil producers to pump more crude oil into the system. </p> <p>As the big oil companies warned that Britain faced paralysis within a few days, the prime minister set his face against meeting militant farmers, drivers, or their lobbying organisations. He is determined not to follow his French counterpart Lionel Jospin, who has caved in to protests. </p> <p>Mr Blair believes that with vigorous policing there are sufficient refineries and exits from them to overcome the blockades. Ministers seem to believe that in practice fewer refineries are being blocked that reported in the media. </p> <p>But Roy Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, warned last night that the government's hard line is playing into the hands of the protesters. \"It is in danger of getting the motorist to fall in behind the protesters,\" he said. \"I think politicians saying they are not going to do anything about the problem is really very likely to swing public opinion firmly behind the protests.\" </p> <p>He warned that in the next 48 hours ministers would have to make some positive moves to restore supplies, particularly for emergency supplies \"because the industry was not prepared for this crisis\". </p> <p>He joined Downing Street in calling for the oil companies to consider taking legal action against protesters, but the large producers - notably Shell, and BP - appeared cool about escalating the dispute. Shell, first hit by the blockade at its Stanlow refinery in Cheshire, said it would not resort to the law. </p> <p>Police have a variety of powers - but none under the last government's trade union laws because this is not classed as a union dispute. Nevertheless, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1994 they could arrest individuals causing harm to people and property or unlawfully blocking the highway. And under the Public Order Act of 1986 they have the power to arrest protesters for threatening or abusive behaviour or harassment. </p> <p>Around the country, from Scotland to Cornwall, motorists formed long queues at filling stations. Many were turned away. Police had to be called to disperse angry motorists at one filling station in Derby which had doubled the price of fuel. </p> <p>Repercussions spread far beyond the forecourt. Liverpool taxi drivers brought the city to a standstill. Anglesey council in North Wales said rubbish collections will stop today because fuel has dried up. West Sussex had stopped all non-emergency use of fire engines. </p> <p>Matthew Aitkin, a haulage contractor protesting outside BP's Grangemouth refinery in Scotland summed up the mood of defiance. \"We would like to stop all the tankers coming out of Grangemouth so I'm afraid Joe Public is going suffer - the only thing that will move the government is Joe Public suffering.\" </p> <p>The CBI, meanwhile, urged the Government to cut duty on diesel. \"They have an opportunity to demonstrate to business that it recognises the pressure business is under.\" </p> <p>Union leaders at the TUC in Glasgow showed signs of supporting the protesters. Roger Lyons, of the MSF, said: \"The inaction of Opec is unsatisfactory and given the action of the French government last week in making concessions on fuel duty, when the French rates were lower than in Britain, the increasing cost in Britain of oil based products is looking more and more like highway robbery.\" <br> <b>Running on empty:</b> <br><b> \u0095 Texaco</b> A third of 957 garages nationwide are close to empty or dry.

  "<b> Why are British motorists paying more in petrol taxes than drivers anywhere else in Europe?</b> <p> When Norman Lamont was Chancellor he introduced the practice of increasing duties on petrol faster than inflation. The justification for the so-called fuel \"escalator\" was environmental: the government wants to discourage us from using cars and adding to global warming. </p> <p> <b> Do higher petrol costs deter people from driving?</b> </p> <p> The number of miles driven in Britain has risen by 12% since the start of the decade. However, the government believes that had fuel duties not risen so fast people would have driven even more miles. That is why Gordon Brown increased the fuel escalator from 5% over inflation to 6% when Labour came to power. Green considerations aside, it has also been a handy source of funds for Treasury. </p> <p> <b> What happened to the fuel escalator?</b> </p> <p> Mr Brown scrapped it in November last year, and promised future above-inflation increases in fuel duties would be spent on measures to improve public transport and the road network. </p> <p> <b> How much is the tax worth to the government?</b> </p> <p> The Treasury takes 71p in every pound spent on petrol. Last year, motorists contributed \u00a336bn to the government's coffers. </p> <p> <b> Is blockading refineries legal?</b> </p> <p> No, but if the French experience is anything to go by it's a lot more effective at grabbing political attention than the dump the pump campaign's rather feeble attempts to persuade people to stop filling up their cars. In France, fishermen and farmers wrung promises out of government ministers to cut fuel duties after they brought cross channel traffic to a standstill. </p> <p> <b> Could the organisers face legal action?</b> </p> <p> It is not an industrial dispute, so the organisers are not protected by legal exemptions which cover industrial pickets. In theory they could be sued by the oil companies for loss of revenue or moved on by the police for blocking a public highway. </p> <p> <b> What powers do police have to break blockades?</b> </p> <p> Individual chief constables have the responsibility for deciding what action will be taken in response to local circumstances. Powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1994 could be used to arrest individuals causing harm to people or property or unlawfully obstructing the highway. Common law powers allow police to make arrests to prevent a breach of the peace. Under the Public Order Act 1986 they have the power to arrest individual protesters for threatening or abusive behaviour or harassment. </p> <p> <b> Could the Chancellor cut petrol taxes?</b> </p> <p> Excise duty and VAT on fuel could theoretically be decreased by statutory order, without the need for primary legislation. This mechanism is used each year on Budget day to ensure that changes in taxation on consumer goods come into effect at midnight that day. Normally Parliament has to be sitting for a statutory order to come into effect, but it is possible for the Government to seek the agreement of the lord chancellor and the speaker for it to be put into immediate effect in the absence of MPs during recess. </p> <p> <b> Can he afford to do it?</b> </p> <p> Cutting fuel taxes by 2p a litre would cost the treasury about \u00a31bn which ministers say would have to be found elsewhere, either in spending cuts or tax hikes. However, there will be more money in the Chancellor's coffers than he initially expected this year, and rising oil prices is one of reasons. Analysts say it has boosted Treasury revenues by an extra \u00a31bn this year, which could be given back to drivers in tax cuts. However, that would contradict the government's environmental goals and in any case, Mr Brown would prefer to save any tax cuts for the maximum political impact in the run up to the election expected early next year. </p> <p> <b> Will the announcement that oil exporting countries are going to increase production help prices?</b> </p> <p> Not in the short term. Petrol prices are already set to rise, because of the high prices of crude over the last month. The production increase is not expected to bring the price of crude oil down below $30 a barrel, and if oil prices stay at that level petrol prices could reach \u00a34 a gallon. </p> <p> <b> Could the blockades damage the economy?</b> </p> <p> Business leaders are warning that the blockades are causing problems. They support calls for lower fuel duties but want protests to end.</p>",
  "In Indiana earlier this week a university basketball coach was dismissed for chronically aggressive behaviour. Such are the bare facts of the fall of Bobby Knight, but they go nowhere near conveying the enormity of this event in the eyes of the US public. There were near-riots in the streets. It was front-page news, led the television bulletins and dominated talkshows. <p>It was, in short, the sort of coverage normally reserved for national leaders. But that is just the point. The attention Bobby Knight commands says a lot about the preoccupations of everyday America which usually pass unseen.</p> <p>Knight is undeniably a colourful figure. His idea of a motivational technique appears to be grabbing his players by the throat. He was captured on video doing just that to a young basketball star at a practice game in 1997 and when the video came to light earlier this year, confirming some of the rumours about Knight's behaviour, it triggered a crisis. </p> <p>There had been numerous other incidents which suggested that Knight had - in the euphemistic parlance of modern US therapy - \"issues\" with \"anger management\". For several years he was wanted in Puerto Rico for assaulting a policeman and the case was only dropped after the local government gave up trying to extradite him. He threw chairs across basketball courts and launched violent invective against other staff members.</p> <p>In May, when the throat-grabbing video emerged, Knight was cautioned and placed on a \"zero-tolerance\" regime, meaning his job depended on unblemished behaviour. The probation did not last long. On Sunday, the Indiana University president Myles Brand announced Knight was being sacked for a string of ugly incidents, including the alleged manhandling of another player.</p> <p>All hell broke loose. Crowds of students took to the streets, burning university regalia. \"Wanted\" pictures appeared depicting the student who had complained about Knight's behaviour in the latest incident, and he was forced to flee campus after receiving death threats.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine comparable scenes in Europe, or anywhere else in the world. Elsewhere, college sports coaches don't count for very much, because college sports themselves are not considered important.</p> <p>In the US, they are all-consuming. Whole towns turn out to watch their college team play, whether it be basketball, American football or baseball. It is the focal point of civic and institutional pride, and in Indiana, Knight was an institution. Knight's winning ways on the basketball court helped the midwestern state hold its head up and gave it something to cheer about. </p> <p>In other down-at-heel towns, in the backwoods of Pennsylvania for example, American football is king. For many young men, playing college sports will be the high-point of their lives. They will be watched by tens of thousands, and their successes hailed as if they were military triumphs.</p> <p>The same goes for secondary school soccer and Little League baseball. They attract hundreds of spectators every weekend, and have become important social occasions in their own right.</p> <p>All this says a lot of good things about America. Parents and local communities tend to be much more engaged in their children and the games they play than in Europe. When I played football for my school in London, hardly anyone came to watch. If an American-sized crowd had turned up to any of my games, I would have been overcome with pride and stage fright.</p> <p>Furthermore, the American obsession with sport is also far more even-handed than on the other side of the Atlantic. Because of a 1972 piece of legislation called Title IX, which forces schools to spend as much on girls' sports as boys', girls get almost as much attention as boys. </p> <p>The results include a well-attended women's professional basketball league, and the best women's soccer team in the world, by far. In Britain, women's football is treated as a joke. In the US, half the nation watched as the US beat China in the Women's World Cup last year.</p> <p>There is, of course, a downside, and it is personified by Bobby Knight. College and school sports are now taken so seriously, there is no room left for humour and failure. If a child is not athletic the sense of marginalisation is all the greater on the nights the whole town goes out to watch the high school team.</p> <p>And then there is the rage. It percolates up through the playing field turf and pervades children's sports like a noxious gas. There is now a recognised syndrome called \"Little League rage\" - a pattern of assaults by parents on umpires, officials and other parents, and it applies to sports other than baseball. </p> <p>A man was killed a few weeks ago after a dispute at a children's ice-hockey match.

  "The gut belief of many Americans that gun ownership has been central to their way of life since colonial days is a 20th century invention, says a book published in the US this week. <p>There are currently estimated to be more than 250m firearms in private hands and every year 5m new guns are being bought - overwhelmingly by white men aged between 25 and 34. More than 16,000 people are shot dead each year on average. </p> <p>Those who oppose the introduction of tough laws restricting firearms argue that widespread access to such weapons is part of America's gun-toting militia history before, during and after the independence revolution that began in 1775. </p> <p>Not so, says Michael Bellesiles of Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, in a book which, according to a New York Times review this week, \"deflates the myth of the self-reliant and self-armed virtuous yeoman of the revolutionary militias\". </p> <p>Professor Bellesiles says that the fact that the modern US contains more gunshops than schools \"would have shocked the toughest resident of the early American frontier\". </p> <p>The National Rifle Association and other pro-gun lobbies often evoke a picture of the 18th-century pioneer armed and ready to kill for his supper, armed to defend his property against marauders and standing shoulder to shoulder with his equally armed neighbours against oppressive government - British or American - in defence of a free way of life. </p> <p>Prof Bellesiles says this image is almost wholly false. Most Americans in the time of George Washington and the \"founding fathers\" who signed the declaration of independence in 1776 were growers and traders, not hunters, he said. </p> <p>His book, Arming America: the Origins of a National Gun Culture, says that only some 14% of households in northern New England and Pennsylvania had firearms in the years 1765 to 1790 - years typically thought of as the heyday of gun ownership and use. Over half of the guns recorded in contemporary surveys were listed as broken or otherwise defective, the book says. </p> <p>Perhaps because they were unfamiliar and unpractised with the firearms of the day, early Americans were not very skilled with them. Prof Bellesiles points to the encounter that set off the revolutionary war in earnest in April 1775, near Concord and the village of Lexington, less than 20 miles from Boston. </p> <p>Military accounts speak of British troops withdrawing from the area through a 15-mile gauntlet of \"incessant firing\". Yet. says the book, 3,763 armed Americans hiding behind walls, trees and farm buildings along this corridor managed to hit only 273 of the withdrawing British soldiers with their bullets. </p> <p>These were the years in which the founders of the US wrote the second amendment to the constitution, on which the legal claims of today's gun culture rest. The amendment, adopted in 1791, states that: \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" </p> <p>Thomas Jefferson and his colleagues would have been shocked, Prof Bellesiles believes, to learn that one member of the current US supreme court, Justice Antonin Scalia, considers that citizens have a constitutionally protected right to own machine guns. </p> <p>\"America's gun culture is an invented tradition,\" Prof Bellesiles writes. \"It was not present at the nation's creation, whenever we fix that point.\" </p> <p>Individual ownership of guns really became possible, he argues, only when Samuel Colt began to perfect the pistol in the 1830s. But the civil war of 1861-65 was, he says, \"the moment when a large proportion of the country tried to replace elections with gunfire\".</p>",
  "<p> Eurotunnel drivers' ballot<br> </p> <p>Eurotunnel train drivers are to be balloted on strikes in a dispute over union recognition which could \"paralyse\" shuttle services. Drivers' union Aslef is urging its 230 members at Eurotunnel to back 24-hour stoppages from next month. </p> <p>The move follows a long dispute over a single union deal struck between Eurotunnel and the TGWU union, under which that union will represent Eurotunnel employees - including train drivers. </p> <p>Mick Rix, Aslef's general secretary, said: \"I hope Eurotunnel management will now see sense and avoid the disruption to the travelling public which follows from their refusal to recognise the union of their train crews' choice.\"</p> <p><strong> Japan on road to recovery</strong><br> </p> <p>Japan's economic recovery appeared to be picking up steam yesterday with the release of data showing that the country's cautious consumers are at last loosening their purse strings.

  "<p>The disturbing and fiercely disputed theory that the Aids virus was unleashed accidentally by western medical researchers in Africa in the 1950s gained new impetus yesterday, with the emergence of fresh witness testimony about the use of chimpanzees in an African mass vaccination trial. </p> <p>Ed Hooper, a writer who has spent a decade seeking the source of the epidemic, told an international conference on the origins of Aids in London that the new evidence was the \"smoking gun\" in support of his claim that Aids crossed from chimps to humans when doctors used their kidneys to prepare an experimental oral polio vaccine (OPV). </p> <p>But Mr Hooper's opponents were also triumphant yesterday, pointing to results from tests on an archived sample of the vaccine which showed that it contained no trace of DNA from either a chimp or an HIV-type virus. </p> <p>Surviving members of the US-Belgian research team involved in the trials deny that they used chimps to make the vaccine, although they have given contradictory accounts of what happened in the past. </p> <p>One of them, Stanley Plotkin, said: \"There is no gun, there is no bullet, there is no shooter. There's only smoke created by Mr Hooper.\" </p> <p>The now elderly researchers and other opponents of Mr Hooper are attending the two-day conference, in what amounts to a showdown with enormous repercussions. </p> <p>If the international scientific community ever accepted the OPV theory of the origins of Aids, there would be powerful legal, moral and political consequences for relations between Africa and the west. </p> <p>There are 34m HIV-infected people in the world today. Almost 20m people have already died, 15,000 in Britain. However, most of the dead, are from sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p>It is already accepted that the HIV-1 virus, the dominant cause of Aids, crossed into humans from a virus, SIV-cpz, carried by chimps. </p> <p>But most researchers maintain that the transfer happened as the result of an accidental blood-to-blood infection, when a native hunter with an open wound was catching or slaughtering a chimp for food - the \"natural transfer\" theory. </p> <p>In his book The River, published last year, Mr Hooper argued that the sites of most of the earliest known cases of Aids, in the former Belgian colonies of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, coincided with the sites of mass vaccinations with an experimental polio vaccine called Chat between 1957 and 1960. The vaccine was produced by a team led by US virologist Hillary Koprowski. </p> <p>Mr Hooper argues that there is powerful circumstantial evidence that the makers of Chat had used local chimps, instead of the more commonly used rhesus monkeys, to supply the kidneys used to make early polio vaccines. </p> <p>The surviving researchers, led by Dr Koprowski, say that they used captured chimps to test, not make, the vaccine. Yet there is a baffling lack of documentation on what was going on in the African facilities. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Hooper produced testimony from witnesses which strengthened his claim that Dr Koprowski's collaborators were regularly removing kidneys from chimps and sending them abroad. </p> <p>In a signed statement, Louis Bugyaki, who worked as a vet in Stanleyville - now Kisangani - where the Koprowski team's lab and chimp facility was located, said he had been told by two of the Belgian doctors working there that chimp organs, mostly kidneys, were being sent to the US. </p> <p>\"It is possible that the main purpose of sending the kidneys there was to provide cells in which the Koprowski polio vaccines could be grown,\" said Mr Bugyaki, who now lives in Brussels. </p> <p>\"I was told by the [doctors] that the sending of chimp kidneys abroad was to be kept a secret. I think there is a strong possibility that this was a commercial secret, and that the vaccine-makers did not want the role that the chimps had played to be known.\" </p> <p>Another witness, Juma Jamnadas, who worked as a microscopist at a lab in Bujumbura in Burundi in the 1950s, said that he saw single kidneys regularly being removed from chimps and sent to a lab in the Congo where a collaborator of Dr Koprowski's, Tadeusz Wiktor, worked and produced a range of vaccines. </p> <p>Dr Plotkin described Mr Bugyaki's testimony as \"hearsay\", and said that the vet had given contradictory information to him. </p> <p>Yesterday Claudio Basilico, professor of microbiology at the New York University school of medicine, revealed that there were no signs of contamination in tests by independent labs on a tiny set of samples of vaccine held by the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, where much of the Chat vaccine used in Africa was made. </p> <p>However, this does not disprove the OPV-Aids theory, since there were several different batches of Chat vaccine and it is unlikely that all would have been contaminated with chimp SIV.</p>",
  "Employers should put an end to a \"burnout Britain\" where millions of employees work the longest hours in Europe and should stop whinging about red tape, John Monks, TUC general secretary, said yesterday. <p>His call came as the TUC's annual congress demanded fresh legislation to boost workers' rights, including measures to protect staff from unpaid overtime worth at least \u00a323bn to employers each year.</p> <p>A TUC survey estimated that at least 4m employees regularly work more than five hours extra unpaid a week, with half of these working on days off, and 12m saying work stress makes them irritable and bad tempered at home.</p> <p>Unions told employers to stop complaining about the multimillion pound cost of employment protection, sums dwarfed by the value of unpaid overtime.</p> <p>Delegates overwhelmingly backed a motion demanding a new raft of measures to extend union rights at work, including paid parental leave.</p> <p>The TUC called for an end of the opting out of the EU's working time directive limiting the working week to 48 hours. It said one in eight employees - more than 3m - was still working more than 48 hours and the directive has failed to reduce the hours of 75% of workers on very long hours to below 48.</p> <p>A report by the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux found that many employers are also avoiding giving the full weeks of paid holiday to which workers were entitled under the directive.</p> <p>The TUC said official figures suggesting unpaid overtime is worth \u00a323bn to employers were an underestimate, with managers contributing more than \u00a35,000 free each year, professionals over \u00a37,000 and even the lowest paid upwards of \u00a31,000. Mr Monks ridiculed employer bodies for inflating the cost of protective measures, saying the cost of unpaid parental leave was 2p per employee a week and better maternity provision 5p per woman of child bearing age.</p> <p>He said: \"The government should be robust in the face of employer opposition to modest improvements. They should promote the benefits of necessary regulation and point out the dangers - and costs - of a lack of regulation.</p> <p>\"Employers should stop whinging about the wrong things and start worrying about the right ones. I say to the CBI - less complaining, more cooperating.\"</p> <p>He said: \"Let's help people work smarter, not longer; let's forge a better balance between work and family life. Let's look at how we can get the economy to grow faster and get to full employment. Let's ask how we can create more world class firms and how we can build better public services.\"</p> <p>A regional breakdown of the TUC survey showed that workers in London and the south-east were more likely to do unpaid overtime than those anywhere else. London workers were the most likely to need time off because of stress while almost one in two workers in the south-east were more likely to be bad tempered and irritable at work.</p> <p>Workers in the south-west and Yorkshire were among the least stressed. Most people in Wales enjoyed their jobs but more of them complained about work pressures than in any other part of the UK.</p> <p>One in three in the north-west complained that work caused a headache while Scots were among the least likely to take time off work due to stress related illness, and only a minority said they did not like their jobs.</p>",
  "Baroness Brooke, who has died aged 92, was an affable pillar of the Conservative party - a vice-chairman for a decade, and one of its most deft and tenacious committee women. It was typical of her warm nature that when her husband, Henry Brooke, the former Tory Home Secretary, fell ill with Parkinson's disease in the 1970s, she withdrew from public life to nurse him. <p>The two shared an old-fashioned puritanism. Such an attitude provoked gales of laughter in the Lords during its 1969 debate on tattooing, when Lady Brooke said: \"I can definitely say how disturbed I would have been as a young girl if I had found my noble kinsman [and husband] already tattooed with 'I love you Diana'.\" </p> <p>Born in Llanwern, west Wales, the youngest daughter of Canon Alfred Mathews, a vicar and former Welsh rugby international, Barbara Brooke went from Queen Anne's school, Caversham, to the Gloucester Training College of Domestic Science. She taught at secondary school in Dagenham, Essex, and qualified as a nurse at St Thomas's hospital, London. It was a background that inspired standards of hard work, honesty and godliness. </p> <p>She caught the eye of Henry Brooke at a party given by her brother at Balliol College, Oxford. They married in 1933 and settled in West Hampstead. After rural Wales, Barbara found London lonely: \"It wasn't until I began to push a pram that I really got to know people,\" she recalled. </p> <p>Barbara made her political debut by taking the working-class Kilburn ward from Labour in 1948, to join her husband on Hampstead borough council. She soon showed brilliance in committee work, covering her steely determination with tact and affability, and, as chairman of housing in 1951, was the first to introduce differential rents. Fellow Tories decided it was her impact that helped Henry get the Tory selection for Hampstead when the parliamentary seat fell vacant just before the 1950 general election. </p> <p>In 1954, as vice-chairman of the Conservative party organisation, Barbara beguiled many by her country-girl mock simplicity. But her enormous energy, tenacity and good nature kept her in the job for a decade. Among other things, she saw that the Tories, who relied overwhelmingly on women volunteers, underused them in mainstream politics - she was shocked to find, for example, that only one of the 19 Conservative women candidates in the 1955 election was in a safe seat. She tried to persuade fellow vice-chairman John Hare (later Lord Blakenham) to get winnable seats to interview at least one woman. </p> <p>In 1964, Barbara was made a life peer, two years before her husband. She spoke in favour of compulsory religious education, grant-aided schools, against training doctors entirely within hospitals, and in favour of giving teachers housing in slum areas into which they were being posted. In 1967, she became frontbench spokesman on welfare, while Lord Brooke was frontbench spokesman on the Home Office - the first time that a married couple had held such posts. In 1968, she became president of the National Union of Conservative Associations, only the third such woman in Tory history. </p> <p>Her greatest personal initiative probably came 25 years ago when, as chairman of Godolphin and Latymer school, she persuaded fellow governors and parents to defy the Inner London Education Authority, which wanted it to merge with another school and become a comprehensive. Her plan was to turn Godolphin into an independent school, and she helped raise the \u00a3500,000 to stake it. </p> <p>She is survived by two daughters and two sons, the elder, Peter, being a former Northern Ireland Secretary and the younger, Sir Henry, a lord justice of appeal. </p> <p>\u0095 Barbara Mathews Brooke, Baroness Brooke of Ystradfellte, born January 14 1908; died September 1 2000</p>",
  "Sitting in the number one court at Highbury Corner magistrates court in north London, Toby Springer, who has died aged 93, was one of the old-fashioned, feared and fearsome breed of stipendiary magistrates who took the then fashionable view that his role was to support the police. One of his contemporaries recalls that, during the luncheon adjournment, Springer would gently chide him for not finding enough defendants guilty. <p>He made his mark on the metropolitan bench, at the now defunct Balham and Old Street courts, before he went to Highbury Corner, the first of the 1960s mega-courts. A handsome, courteous, leonine man, one solicitor described his head as being a cross between that of a brigadier and a golden retriever. </p> <p>Springer did not grant what he considered unnecessary legal aid certificates. He was a great believer in the short sharp shock. Three weeks in custody on remand for reports was his version of judicial medicine. Then, since he had no intention of imposing a custodial sentence, there was no need to waste public money by providing the miscreant with an advocate. If an advocate was needed, he would award a legal aid certificate on the spot, give the defender five minutes to read the probation report and hear the case. </p> <p>Generally, even if the defendant had a bad record, Springer would deal with the case himself. \"I hope you won't send my client to the crown court,\" said one advocate. \"Certainly not,\" replied Springer. \"The case is far too serious.\" He was not going to take the chance that some lily-livered judge might consider probation or another form of non-custodial sentence. And generally the client was happy with Springer's three months. </p> <p>But his bark was a great deal worse than his bite. As with any magistrate who sits for 20 years, Springer developed his foibles. He took against advocates who were not in his courtroom when the case was called. When he became very deaf, it was necessary to shout at the witness. He also took to reminiscing; when a man was accused of pickpocketing in, say, Safeway, he might remark, \"Ah, yes, the old Odeon cinema\", and look balefully at the defendant, surprised that he should have sinned on formerly holy ground. </p> <p>The son of a director of the Federation of British Industries, Springer was educated at Mill Hill school, in north London, from 1921 to 1925, and read law at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar in 1929, becoming a member of Gray's Inn. </p> <p>After distinguished war service with the 60th Rifles in the Middle East - he became a lieutenant-colonel - Springer returned to the bar in 1945, and was an acting deputy chairman of the old County of London sessions in 1962 and 1963, the year he was appointed a stipendiary magistrate. </p> <p>Out of court, he was a sociable man, who had an extensive collection of watercolours. Devoted to golf, he was a long-time member at Porters Park, in Hertfordshire. Magistrates then sat for only four days a week, and Springer was always happy to sit on a Saturday - which could mean an extra half day on the course. He was a life governor of Mill Hill school and the Metropolitan hospital, and was made a freeman of the City of London in 1982. In Budapest, in 1936, he married Stella Rauchweger, who survives him. </p> <p>\u0095 Tobias 'Toby' Springer, stipendiary magistrate, born April 3 1907; died August 17 2000</p>",
  "Travellers using the Channel Tunnel face the prospect of renewed disruption next month after the train drivers' union Aslef yesterday said it would ballot shuttle drivers for a series of 24-hour strikes in its recognition dispute with Eurotunnel. <p>Eurotunnel has refused to recognise Aslef, which claims 230 members out of 270 train crew workers, but under pressure of employment rights legislation signed a single-union deal covering all staff with the Transport and General Workers' union. A limited overtime ban was called in protest last month.</p> <p>If the strikes go ahead, the impact is likely to be severe and Aslef yesterday called on the company to open talks before it brought \"chaos to its customers through its industrial intransigence\".</p> <p>The TGWU leadership says it has asked Eurotunnel to talk to Aslef, but the company is reluctant to deal separately with the drivers, who are among the lowest paid in the country, and risk having to pay more as a result.</p> <p>The strike call came as TUC delegates in Glasgow agreed to press Tony Blair to give all workers full employment rights on day one in a job and to remove some of the most serious restrictions on the union recognition legislation passed last year.</p> <p>The TUC wants recognition rights extended to workers in companies employing 20 people or fewer, the removal of the 40% yes vote ballot threshold and the right to reinstatement for all workers sacked for taking part in legal strikes.</p> <p>The congress also demanded the right for workers to take solidarity or \"secondary\" action, outlawed by the Thatcher government but provided for under International Labour Organisation conventions, signed by Britain.</p> <p>However, delegates rejected calls for the return of the closed shop and a motion from the National Union of Mineworkers urging support for those who refused to comply with anti-union laws.</p> <p>Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said trade unions needed to use their muscle on behalf of weaker groups such as pensioners, who were \"not strong enough to help themselves\".</p> <p>But Bill Morris, the transport union leader, retorted that, even when unions had successfully defied anti-union laws in the past, the TUC had never condoned action that broke the law.</p>",
  "<p>A new generation of genetically modified crops could be a key to richer wildlife and efficient food production on British farms, a leading scientist said last night. </p> <p>Sir John Beringer, the dean of science at Bristol University, was until last year chairman of the government's advisory committee on releases into the environment. He told the British Association for the Advancement of Science festival in London that the presence of more songbirds on British farms would depend on encouraging the survival of more weeds and insects. </p> <p>Many British farmland birds have been in long-term decline, and a number of British wild plants have begun to vanish because of new farming practices. But Prof Beringer said with new thinking, 10% or 20% of the crop could be weeds and farmers could still have a good yield. </p> <p>\"Perversely the only safe way I can think of doing that is to breed herbicide tolerant crops which would enable you to use herbicides as little as possible,\" he said </p> <p>\"We also need to reduce the use of pesticides to kill insects, because insects are food for birds,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We can do this by incentives for farmers to allow more insects to occur. We could do it by stopping the use of insecticides, which would be largely organic farming.\" </p> <p>The trouble with a total ban was that insects could get completely out of control. But he believed that by genetic manipulation, plants could be made insect resistant - but only express that resistance when they were heavily infested. </p> <p>\"We have to be thinking about how to have more plants and more insects in crops to provide diversity and food for wildlife,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think we have to stop ploughing if we possibly can - and that is a serious problem for organic farming - because we should leave as many plants in the ground for as long as possible.\" </p> <p>Farmers also had to reduce the amounts of fertilisers they used, because many weeds could not compete with well-nourished crops. This could be done by breeding, or engineering genes that would enable crops to \"fix\" nitrogen from the air, rather than from fertiliser. </p> <p>\"We have got to increase the amount of wildlife because we want it ... but it has to be done in a way in which farmers can survive and produce food reasonably cheaply and in large quantities,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think we have to consider, whether we like it or not, that genetic engineering may actually have some solutions, if we look at it sensibly.\" </p> <p>He was not surprised at resistance so far to GM crops, he said. \"The presentation, to date, has been absurd. </p> <p>\"Herbicide-tolerant crops have been introduced on the basis that you can control weeds, which by definition for most people implies eliminating them all. </p> <p>\"A more rational and intelligent introduction of the crops would have been to say: here is a way in which you can actually let weeds grow. And if they become a serious problem, you can get rid of them.\"</p>",
  "Sir Banja Tejan-Sie, who has died aged 83, was the last governor-general of Sierra Leone, and played many roles in the life of the former colony both before and after its independence in 1961. <p>He was brought up and educated in the capital, Freetown, becoming the first member of his family to go to university. Before leaving to study abroad, he worked as a station clerk for Sierra Leone railways and, from 1940 to 1946, as a nurse in the colony's medical department. </p> <p>That same year he married Admire Stapleton, and left west Africa for the London School of Economics, where he studied law. He was called to the bar in 1951, and, while in London, became an active member of the West African Students' Union, an important organisation which was a hotbed of debate - about the future and independence of Africa - and optimism for students, particularly those from the British west African colonies. </p> <p>On his return to Sierra Leone, Sir Banja displayed a liking for politics, and joined the nascent Sierra Leone People's party; from 1953 to 1956, he was its vice-president. In 1954, he served as a member of the Keith Lucas commission on electoral reform, which paved the way for a change in the country's electoral system that would eventually lead to the formation of the political parties that later contested Sierra Leone's first democratic elections. </p> <p>In 1955, Sir Banja became a police magistrate, first for the country's eastern, and then, northern provinces. In 1961, he was appointed senior police magistrate for the whole of the provinces. He also served as speaker of the house of representatives, the Sierra Leone parliament, and, from 1967 to 1970, he was the chief justice of Sierra Leone. During this time, he handed down a landmark judgment affecting the rights to citizenship of those born in Sierra Leone of Lebanese origins. </p> <p>Sir Banja was appointed governor-general in 1968 - the third and the last person to hold the post before Sierra Leone became a republic in 1971 - overseeing the hand-over to civilian rule following the country's first military coup of 1967. He was knighted in 1970 and, even after retirement, carried on a tireless regime of involvement in many areas, and made countless visits to lend his legal expertise to other African countries and in the Caribbean. </p> <p>Those who knew Sir Banja will recall a handsome man, who was a sharp dresser, fit and alert, as well as of keen intellect, who never felt too old to learn something new.

  "The most disappointing aspect of the petrol row (Protests grow despite oil offer, September 11) is the dearth of discussion of transport pricing policy in the UK. The fact is that our petrol is still cheap when compared with the cost of public transport. <p>While petrol prices in the UK are nearly double those in Spain, our public transport is at least four times more expensive. A 10-trip multi-journey ticket for the whole of Madrid costs 700 pesetas (\u00a32.70), compared with \u00a311 for 10 zone-one underground tickets in London; the undergound journey to Heathrow will cost you 12 times as much as in Madrid. </p> <p>The comparison is similar throughout Europe, even in countries such as Sweden where petrol costs are the same as in UK. A one-month season ticket for the entire Stockholm county is 450 kroner (\u00a334), which would barely buy a single week's commuter travel in any of the UK's major conurbations.<br> <b>Ken Thomas</b><br> Crosby, Merseyside <a href=\"ken@thomas.u-net.com\">ken@thomas.u-net.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 Tony Blair should turn to the excellent lawyer by his side whilst he ponders the problem of petrol blockades. </p> <p>She would undoubtedly advise him to get an injunction against the hauliers and farmers as granted against the south Wales miners by Mr Justice Scott in 1985.

If the refinery owners could show special damage, they could rely on the judgment of Mr Justice Stuart-Smith in 1987, when he held the union picketing of the Wapping newspaper plant constituted private and public nuisance.

  "Foday Kallay still has big plans. You might not know it looking at the skinny young man of broken spirit under interrogation at Freetown criminal investigation department, but the self-styled \"brigadier\", and leader of the West Side Boys until their encounter with the British army on Sunday, has not given up hope of making a mark on Sierra Leone. <p>He says he has seen the light and abandoned war for politics. \"No more violence. I want to be a politician,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Kallay cuts a sad figure, dressed only in a filthy Calvin Klein T-shirt and his underwear. He is no longer the big man, gun in hand with British officers desperate to save their men deferentially referring to him as \"brigadier\". </p> <p>Now he has a couple of policemen confronting him with his own reality. One threatened to cut Mr Kallay's arms off, just as his followers had hacked the limbs from innocent Sierra Leoneans. Another said that if he did not cooperate, they would dump him on a street corner and see what the citizens of Freetown did to him. Mr Kallay was very much against that idea. So he ploughed on with the lengthy statement as a policeman wrote it down longhand. </p> <p>He regretted it all, he said. All the more so because he insisted he was just about to release the six British soldiers and one Sierra Leonean officer he held hostage for two weeks. That was not the impression gained by the negotiators as the swaggering, drunk leader demanded that the government quit and his criminal comrades be released from prison. </p> <p>Mr Kallay says he knew the attack was under way the moment he heard the helicopters. He might have fought, like some of his braver, if less wise, followers. Instead he ran. As the helicopter guns cut down the men around him, Mr Kallay flung himself to the ground and lay under their bodies. </p> <p>From there he watched others jump into the river in a terrified attempt to escape the bullets pumping out from the five helicopters swarming over the villages. </p> <p>His fellow commanders, \"Colonel Savage\" and \"Colonel Terminator\", disappeared. But their loyalty was in question anyway. Mr Kallay said he had them detained at the time of the attack because they were trying to overthrow him. Perhaps they had realised that the ludicrousness of his demands would cost them their lives. </p> <p>The former \"brigadier\" - he says he no longer wants to be called that - was in awe of his captors. \"Their firepower was unmatchable. We could not escape,\" he mumbled. </p> <p>Mr Kallay spent most of Sunday night being interrogated by the British and the Sierra Leone police. Yesterday too. It was a very different encounter with British officers from the ones in which he so confidently upped his demands and threatened to kill his hostages. </p> <p>The new model Kallay has recorded a radio message calling on his followers to give up the fight and agree to go to a demobilisation camp before they are hunted down. After the British attack, more than 30 West Side Boys turned up at a Jordanian peacekeepers checkpoint asking to be taken in to the camps rather than to prison. But others quickly went back to their old ways, trying to stop buses and plunder from the passengers. Yesterday, though, the UN for once tried to put a stop to it. </p> <p>Twenty-four West Side Boys died during the British raid. Officially, three of the dead were women but the real figure seems to be five. The 25th victim was a man taken prisoner by the West Side Boys and used as a slave labourer. The British hostages knew the attack was planned and warned the man, Braima Phohba, and many other Sierra Leonean captives to stay in their huts but he lost his nerve and started running when the shooting broke out only to get caught by a bullet. </p> <p>The British raid also freed 22 Sierra Leoneans held prisoner for weeks or months by the West Side Boys. Five of them were women abducted and forced to become \"sex combatants\" in the skewed parlance of Sierra Leone. Like the West Side Boys, the larger but just as nasty Revolutionary United Front hauls lorry loads of these women with its fighters to serve as \"morale boosters\" to the rebels. </p> <p>One of the women freed on Sunday gave birth to a boy hours after the raid. </p> <p>The father, the West Side Boys camp commander, \"Lieutenant-Colonel\" Contobie, was killed in the attack. </p> <p>Had the two weeks of negotiations succeeded, and the British hostages walked free, the \"sex combatants\" would still be at Foday Kallay's mercy.</p>",
  "It is always good to see eurosceptic Tory MPs putting their money where their mouths aren't, by taking advantage of the weak euro and patriotically avoiding a bit of UK tax to boot - such as John Townend, an executive of the Tory backbenchers' 1922 committee (the one that used to be called \"influential\" in the days when the Tory party had any influence). The Yorkshire East MP was spotted by the BBC's Jon Sopel in a queue of cars stuck on the wrong side of the Channel during the blockade last week. But he was only there on the way back from Germany, having spent many thousands of the dreaded euro on a brand-new Mercedes Benz. \"It's just a shooting brake for the wife to take the dogs out,\" said John, safely back in the country yesterday and summing up in a sentence how dramatically the Conservative party has changed since its election defeat. Did you save much money on it? \"Oh yes, quite a bit.\" Still, a Mercedes is a fairly expensive \"shooting brake\". \"Oh, it's only a C-class,\" says John. Readers note: the cheapest of the C-class Mercedes on sale in the UK retails on the wrong side of \u00a320,000. <p>\u0095 It may not be the empire-spanning force it once was. But say what you like about the British army - it can still beat the daylights out of a posse of untrained and half-starved drug addled teenagers when required. </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Rawnsley's new book on the Brown-Blair relationship (Swearing At Each Other, \u00a317.99) looks like being a cracking read, and has already garnered much praise (\"A series of tittle tattle gossiping, flambeed up into some frothtastic cocktail,\" Alastair Campbell said yesterday, showing he's lost none of his tabloid touch - stick that on the dust jacket Andrew). But I'm sad to report an inaccuracy in the extract carried in the Observer: \"By the New Year of 1998, the marriage was increasingly strained by stretches of crockery-throwing.\" This is not, as you might think, a frothtastic metaphor. But while it's usually tea cups and coffee mugs that suffer the wrath of Gordon Brown, at least one innocent lamp has gone to that great occasional table in the sky. </p> <p>\u0095 The Countryman's Weekly is an excellent publication of its sort, which is for people who like to shoot things - which seems to include just about anything at all. \"Baboon hunting - an underrated sport,\" reads the page 14 headline in the September 8 issue. And, sadly, we have already missed Sunday's open working ferret show at Tichborne Park, Alresford: \"There is no place for the cotton bud, powder puff ferret.\" How true, how true. </p> <p>\u0095 Channel 4's 100 Greatest Moments From TV Hell at the weekend was very entertaining, with rare footage of the BSB sitcom Heil Honey I'm Home, a comedy involving Adolf Hitler and his Jewish neighbours. Really. (It was canned after one episode.) But the highlight was Michael Winner's finest hour: the 1994 live chatshow dressing-down of the odious Richard Littlejohn. In trying to humiliate a lesbian couple talking about artificial insemination by squirting them with turkey basters, Littlejohn thought he could rely on Michael's support. But no: \"The lesbians have come across with great dignity,\" Michael thundered, \"and you've come over as an arsehole.\" So hats off to the old boy, who began his News of the World column this week by quoting John Stuart Mill. That's not something you see every day. </p> <p>\u0095 Good news in the case of Scottish Widows and its insistence that it had a real customer named Mr Zzzz Zzzzzzzz, as we reported last week. Following the intervention of BBC2's excellent Working Lunch programme, Scottish Widows have decided to make a \u00a3500 donation to charity to apologise for all the junk mail it has been sending to the nonexistent Mr Zzzzzzzz at the address of Michael Curran in Falkirk. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The British Home Office minister Barbara Roche said yesterday she was seeking to open a debate over how immigration laws could be changed to cope with Britain's need for skilled professionals. <p>The UK, Germany, the US and other developed economies are all seeing intense debate about possible legislation that would facilitate entry by foreign hi-tech technicians and engineers. </p> <p>In the case of the US, a longstanding response is: \"Why not put resources into educating native minorities rather than importing engineers?\" A similar objection on behalf of all lowly educated residents has most recently been raised in the UK as well. </p> <p>But such legislation also raises a number of new issues. There is already far more cross-border activity and associated enabling regulation in the highly developed world than many people are aware of. The issue of legislation about hi-tech professionals now being debated in many of these countries is only a further instance of what is already being done in other economic sectors that are less visible. </p> <p>There is a set of provisions in the World Trade Organisation regulations concerning the cross-border mobility of professional workers in finance, telecommunications and a broad range of highly specialised services. </p> <p>Such regimes for the circulation of service workers also exist in many of the regional free-trade agreements as part of the liberalisation of international trade and investment in services. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for one, contains such provisions, even though it was negotiated as an agreement that had nothing to do with cross-border flows of workers. </p> <p>Other forms of such provisions are, for example, the sharp expansion in so-called \"business visas\" in the US over the last decade and, on a much more basic level, the new immigration law passed in Japan in 1990 that opened up the country to foreign professionals in finance, accounting, and other related fields. </p> <p>It would seem that economic globalisation brings with it a need for more flexible cross-border labour circulation. </p> <p>These Nafta and WTO provisions amount to a form of \"migrant worker policy\", although they are addressed to highly specialised workers, and the concept of \"migrant worker\" is usually avoided. </p> <p>The existence of these provisions is little-known even among experts on economic globalisation and immigration, let alone the general public. There was no public outcry when these provisions were instituted. </p> <p>When these kinds of provisions are part of an immigration policy, they are far more likely to become known and subject to public debate and scrutiny. </p> <p>And while these provisions are a regime for labour migration, they are so with one big difference: making such provisions part of the WTO or Nafta means an institutional reshuffling of some of the components of sovereign power over entry on to supranational institutions. It would be worthwhile debating whether it is preferably to have them discreetly incorporated into free trade agreements or made part of immigration policy. </p> <p>The incorporation into WTO and Nafta-type treaties of these provisions for the cross-border mobility of professionals and business persons signals the difficulty of not explicitly dealing with the circulation of people in the implementation of free trade and investment frameworks. </p> <p>In their own specific ways each of these efforts - whether it is the WTO, Nafta, or the far more elaborate case of the European Union - has had in the end to address cross-border labour circulation. </p> <p> So the debate about whether or not to allow the entry of foreign hi-tech workers is but one element of a far broader and more fundamental reconfiguring of specialised labour markets under the impact of economic globalisation. </p> <p>It is extremely important that this be done in the form of a public debate rather than discreetly shifted to institutional domains in practice not subject to public scrutiny. </p> <p>We need to recognise that the issue of the admission of hi-tech workers is only one in a long line of such initiatives. We are already doing it with a variety of regimes and a variety of workers - not only with the familiar cases of maids, nannies, and nurses, but also with professionals in finance, accounting and law. And a far larger set of cases are to come. </p> <p>\u0095 The author is professor of sociology at the University of Chicago<br> <a href=\"mailto:ssassen@midway.uchicago.edu\">ssassen@midway.uchicago.edu</a></p>",
  "<p>The Two Cultures debate today seems more active and urgent inside the arts than between the arts and the sciences. \"Dumbing down\" has become shorthand for a miscellany of alleged failings, but central to the argument is the battle between the traditional arts and popular culture, between art as a pursuit fully appreciated only by a select band of initiates and culture as an expression and reflection of the talents of a very large number of people. This is more often to do with the subject than with the treatment of the subject: ie, all symphonies worthwhile, all pop music pap. It reaches a higher lunacy when otherwise unremarkable people declare that they do not watch television (fair enough) but in terms that make it clear that they are thereby awarding themselves a first-class honours degree. Theatre good, television bad. </p> <p>I am about to launch the 24th season of The South Bank Show, which will again include documentaries on what are often classified as high and low art, on classical and common - even vulgar - subjects. As I look through the list, I believe that the old distinctions are not only less and less relevant to what is actually going on, but increasingly the refuge of the merely snobbish - a champagne-and-canape view of the arts. </p> <p>Perhaps the root of the trouble is that popular culture was taken seriously in the 20th century by many of its creators and by intelligent and committed commentators. What the 20th century delivered to popular culture was a ticket to posterity. Films, records, CDs, television and tapes could preserve work that in previous centuries had been snuffed out. It put popular culture on a par with the traditional forms, which had long found ways to perpetuate themselves. </p> <p>Popular culture was and is the long-overdue arrival of the masses - and that is part of the trouble. Established culture has never liked the masses, and established culture in this country became hopelessly entangled in the class system, the control system - various systems of exclusion that are sometimes only distantly related to an appreciation of the arts themselves. </p> <p>To make matters worse, the 20th century's popular culture - in films and pop music alone - threw up an enormous number of highly talented writers, performers, directors and musicians, with an innovative energy that could make traditional forms seem staid. The fact that successive generations were far more likely to be enchanted by the new popular arts, such as cinema, than the historic, such as theatre, caused and still causes anxiety. This reaches absurdity as senior citizens of our official culture take it on themselves to expel whole activities such as films and rock music from the canon of what should be considered The Arts. </p> <p>I hope it goes without saying that great art continued to flow from traditional sources throughout the last century. In the long run the established forms may prove to have outshone the new. But popular culture must now be reckoned with. </p> <p>One of the questions it raises is this: how are we to judge what more powerfully influences us and, hence, what is stronger or better? See Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron, Madam Butterfly, Phantom of the Opera or Elvis Presley at Las Vegas, and how do we set about judging differences? The cultural diktat of our day still tells us that Schoenberg is superior to Presley; many people go along with that. But is this any more than obedience to hierarchies laid down before popular culture gave itself a true chance to be compared? </p> <p>We hear more and more about the brain, and we were told recently that Mozart is good for you - but is it better for you than Motown? How do we decide this outside subjective experience and - much less reliable - fashion, which plays such a colossal part in appreciation of the arts? Puccini and Andrew Lloyd-Webber are interesting in another way: both can appeal to mass audiences and also to those who have taken the trouble to become connoisseurs, and they can do so in the same piece of music. </p> <p>Many composers have found great satisfaction in using their best skills for mass audiences - Aaron Copland is a useful example. Do we get less out of his score for the film Of Mice and Men than we do out of his concert music? And, returning to Presley, those early songs bear a great deal of repetition - every bit as much as Schoenberg, and to more people. So the accepted notion that art is partly that which endures and bears retelling and re-examining holds as much for Elvis as it does for Moses and Aaron. </p> <p>But, the argument goes, there is an altogether different quality of experience between listening to Beethoven and listening to the Beatles. Different? Granted. Quality? That's difficult. There are times when Beethoven takes you into his music so overwhelmingly that you feel your skin will burst with the sound inside your body. Yet listening to or, better, listening and dancing to the Beatles can provoke a not dissimilar ecstasy. </p> <p>One danger in this argument for the old guard is that it undermines exclusivity. If just anyone can reach peaks of musical pleasure - through pop - where does that leave the vital pecking order (vital, that is, for centuries in societies that saw and often still see high art as primarily a social badge of honour)? </p> <p>There is the important argument of difficulty and complication. Surely Wagner is more difficult than Van Morrison. You need to know more to enjoy more, and from that discipline of learning flow benefits that are simply not available otherwise. There is truth in that. But is difficulty itself a virtue? Finnegans Wake is very complicated but it is not a patch on the simple-seeming Dubliners. Yeats' simplest poems are among his greatest. Self-consciously difficult pop music is very often dire. As importantly, is Van Morrison easy? Which contemporary Faber poet could write successful song lyrics? </p> <p>There is a rooted assumption that popular culture is easy, especially popular music. Millions who try and fail to create it find out the hard way that it is just that - hard. A simple test is to consider the doomed attempts of our greatest living operatic tenors to sing popular tunes. Almost always they are not just poor, but terrible. They can't swing, they have no rhythm. They are afraid to leave the notes on the page; that magnificent growth in the throat gets in the way all the time. Pavarotti could never sing like Presley because he has neither the talent nor the training. Nureyev, although he longed to, could never dance like Fred Astaire. </p> <p>To prefer Placido Domingo to Robbie Williams or vice versa is easy, and what we all do. To try to prove that preference is likely to be very tricky. And, once again, there are figures dancing across the landscape - Leonard Bernstein is one example, David Hockney another - who cut across entrenched positions and make a mockery of them. </p> <p> We face this head on every year when putting together a new season of The South Bank Show. From its inception I thought we should tackle popular music (Blur was the latest) with the same resources and ambitions as we brought to classical music (Simon Rattle the latest); take television drama (Jimmy McGovern) as seriously as theatre (Pinter); explore high-definition performers of comedy (Billy Connolly) as well as virtuosi of the concert platform (Cecilia Bartoli); study thriller writers (Walter Moseley) as well as the more accepted literary figures (Martin Amis). We could reach even wider in our attempt to take on the real world of culture in which balances and powers are changing excitingly and rapidly. </p> <p>It is a strategy that has problems - compounded, I believe, by being pursued on television, a medium still not fully settled into the constellation of the arts despite the work of some brilliant dramatists, comedy writers and documentary directors. </p> <p>This newspaper carries popular culture and established culture with no problems. It seems less easy to achieve inside a television series. Perhaps there is an expectation that television series should be single-stranded. To switch, as we did at the beginning of this year, from Shakespeare to Michael Douglas to Sam Mendes to Dolly Parton and Emir Kusturica is, I believe, to reflect what is going on not just out there but inside the programme-making team. I can see that it might be confusing to those who like things neat and tidy. But this is the way those of us who make those programmes live, and I am certain that is the way many of our viewers see culture today. </p> <p>Gerald Fox, one of the show's producers, is this season making a film in collaboration with the artist Marc Quinn, a film on Santana and another on Amos Oz. Susan Shaw is making films on Marilyn Monroe, with Joyce Carol Oates, and on Rachel Whiteread. David Thomas has documentaries on Tom Jones and Ian Bostridge. Although they will employ different techniques, vary the approach, build the films individually, there is no classification of passion or commitment. The world of culture and arts, tub-thumpingly denounced for being dumbed down by men whose era has long gone, is to them and to all the young film-makers I know a place of multiple experiences, each one demanding equal creative engagement. Difference, not hierarchy, rules. Difference and quality - in every field. </p> <p>A friend suggested to me at this year's Edinburgh festival that some of The South Bank Show's most popular editions - Michael Flatley, Cher, Dawn French - did so well in the ratings that I ought to spin them off into a separate strand and have another one for Simon Rattle, John Tavener, Harold Pinter. All of the latter were excellent programmes, I think, and scored a respectable million or so viewers. But there was a big gap between them and the popular programmes. </p> <p>My belief is that if we had split in that way, we would have given in. We would have given in to those who desperately want the world to go back to the days when culture was a posh voice and being seen was as important as seeing. That would be dumbing down. </p> <p>\u0095 The new series of The South Bank Show starts on ITV on October 1 .</p>",
  "<p>It is often said that art worth looking at once is worth returning to, and that long acquaintance with a work reveals things about it - and us - that a first acquaintance cannot. Thus we imagine the collector wandering his echoing halls at 3am to ponder and gloat, thinking deep thoughts about art, life and the passing of time. Somehow I find it hard to picture Charles Saatchi in this role. And some things, frankly, aren't worth a second look. </p> <p>Ant Noises 2, which opens at the Saatchi Gallery in London tomorrow, might appeal to those who did not find their way to the last Turner prize show, to Sensation, or to those commercial spaces where some of the works here were first seen. For the rest of us, showing a painting by Richard Patterson which was last seen in Sensation feels superfluous. Displaying Tracey Emin's My Bed, the centrepiece of Emin's 1999 Turner prize show, appears premature, as it was last given an airing a mere nine months ago. While the bed had a kind of horrifying theatrical intimacy at the Tate, it looks lost here, and more like the relic of an old art controversy than a revelation of private excruciation. My Bed deserves a bit of a break. </p> <p>There is more point, perhaps, in displaying Jake and Dinos Chapman's etchings after Goya, or Gavin Turk's realistic, life-sized Death of Che - a life-cast of Turk as the revolutionary, in army fatigues, dead on his cement slab - if only because both are given more breathing space here than in their earlier exhibitions. However, the sculptural excerpt from Sarah Lucas's intervention at the Freud Museum earlier this year demands - like Emin's bed - a more confined and even domestic setting in order for it to work. </p> <p>Is this the moment to reconsider these works? Ant Noises 2 does nothing for the reputation of the generation of artists whom Charles Saatchi packaged in his previous exhibitions and in the book Young British Art: The Saatchi Decade, published last year. Sure, many of these artists have made terrific works at one time or another in their decade-long careers, but shows like this add nothing to our appreciation of them. I almost want to issue a disclaimer with this article: Warning - this review contains the regurgitated, twice-cooked remains of a partly digested product that has previously appeared in these pages. </p> <p>Neither Horror at Home, Damien Hirst's 1995 giant ashtray, as big as a paddling pool and inches deep in fag-ends, nor his 1998 vitrine, Contemplating a Self Portrait (as a Pharmacist), represent him at his best, his most dramatic or portentous. The vitrine is a painter's studio, replete with easel, unfinished painting, gungy palette and other paraphernalia. A big mirror at the rear of the vitrine faces the easel, as though the painter were about to embark on a self-portrait. The words I Love You are lipsticked onto the mirror. As a work about a painter's narcissism, it's all a bit flat. </p> <p>Hirst's 1999 suite of prints, The Last Supper, is a series of silkscreened images of pharmaceutical packages, the drugs' brand names replaced by the more homely Steak and Kidney, Omelette, Salad, Sandwich and the like. The perfect, fake pharmaceutical blister-pack for Spiritualized's 1997 CD Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space was, I have to say, a much more thoroughgoing gag in the same vein, even if the music was a bore. </p> <p>Rubbing shoulders with Hirst is Jenny Saville, the painter whom Saatchi has continued to support throughout her otherwise undistinguished career. Her painting here depicts the flank of a supine sow, a row of teats thrown into high, shadowed relief against yards of pinky-grey pork belly, which she paints in the same slappy, tiresome way as she renders human female flesh. Taking me to task over my opinion of Saville's work, one critic said that her detractors were all failed painters themselves or teachers at Goldsmiths College. I have been both in my time, and still feel I am entitled to think she's no good. </p> <p>As a collector, Saatchi may be brave at times. He is entitled to make mistakes, and to go on making mistakes. But he is also very close to being a dealer, even when he would perhaps like us to see him as a one-man museum, albeit one that offloads its acquisitions with alarming frequency. Writing about Ant Noises 1, I ventured the observation that some artists did not want to sell to Saatchi, especially as they frequently have had next to no control over the way their works have been shown. The morning the article appeared, the Saatchi Gallery called to tell me how upsetting Saatchi had found my remarks, and demanded a list of names of the artists. \"If we don't have the names by four o'clock, we'll ring your editor!\" I was told. Oo-er. I'm still not telling. </p> <p>Artists' relationships with their collectors are often, even at best, ambivalent. An old, sick joke had it that Mark Rothko killed himself because he met the people who bought his art. If we had more collectors in this country with Saatchi's clout, all this really wouldn't matter, but we are forced to deal with him, as well as with all the art he shows. Maybe he wants to be an artist too, maybe he wants to write himself into art history. In a sense he has already succeeded. </p> <p>Just like Tracey Emin. Here is a picture of the artist, legs apart, piles of money heaped around her crotch: Tracey in the money, the money in Tracey, or very nearly so. Her beach hut, a perfectly ordinary, weatherbeaten clapboard hut, with its rickety walls and peeling layers of gloss paint, is beached on the gallery floor. It is a very nice beach hut, distressed by the sun and rain and wind. It would look even better on the Whitstable foreshore, whence it comes. Emin's pictures, and the title given to the displaced hut, The Last Thing I Said to You Is Don't Leave Me Here, beg all sorts of stories. </p> <p>Buildings, like beds and rooms, always have stories to tell. There are stories everywhere - even in the Saatchi Gallery. It is the way you tell 'em that matters, or maybe staying out of sight and leaving such things to speak for themselves can count for even more. Emin seems incapable of such reserve. The hut has become a kind of stage-prop in the endless, dramatised retelling of her own life. Perhaps we should look at it in the same way that we regard Dr Johnson's summer house at Kenwood, or George Bernard Shaw's writing shed at Ayot St Lawrence, and imagine Emin's lost summer days, the drunken parties and tearful nights, the estuary tide lapping on the mud. But now the hut is in the gallery and there is nowhere left to hide, no breathing space, no retreat. Even the sanctuary of the painter's studio, nakedly exposed in Hirst's vitrine, has become an object for public consumption. It is time to either order a different dish or move to another restaurant.</p> <p>\u0095 Ant Noises 2 is at the Saatchi Gallery, London NW8 (020-7624 8299), from tomorrow till November 26.</p>",
  "What do you think of when you hear the words Girl Guides? A bygone age of gatherings around the camp fire, the ability to tie fancy knots, a promise to serve queen and country and the acquisition of housewife skills? The campfires, the knots and the rest haven't been banished, but there are changes afoot and a new programme for 10 to 14 year-olds has just been launched along with a campaign which starts this week to recruit adult guide leaders. <p>Girls aged 10 to 14 are one of the most under-researched groups in the UK, although advertisers have started to get interested in them as customers because they can commandeer substantial wads of parental cash. This is the age where girls are subjected to a lot of peer pressure, and self-esteem may plummet. Schoolwork can deteriorate because it's no longer cool to be a swot. </p> <p>This group are of particular interest to the Guide Association because that's the age where defections kick in. After years of faithful attendance at the Rainbow and Brownie sections girls are losing interest in the association a year or two into secondary school. Officials admit that membership has gone down in the last 10 years but they attribute this to demographics rather than disenchantment - there are 200,000 more girls involved now than in the 60s, they say proudly. And with a current membership of 700,000 it's still the biggest girls' voluntary organisation in the country. </p> <p>Barbara Mathieson, project coordinator of the Guide Association programme, admits that there are problems in keeping girls of this age interested. \"Once girls get past the first year of senior school it's an uphill struggle to keep them. Girls are much more independent spirited these days. I think we were a bit too prescriptive before and now we've introduced more flexibility. Adults have a bad image of guiding and some girls might have seen it as old fashioned - about girls who do knots and that's it - but hopefully things will improve.\" </p> <p>The new programme is the result of an extensive three year research project of 10 to 14-year-olds within the association and a wide ranging survey involving 483 girls aged 11 to 17-year-old inside and outside the guides to uncover their hopes and dreams for the 21st century. The survey, conducted by Opinion Leader Research for the Guide Association and published in May, found that 82% of girls wanted to spend more time with other girls their own age and 80% weren't bothered whether they had a boyfriend or not. </p> <p>Most were confident and ambitious and felt in control of their future. The internal Guide Association research found that health and fitness, food and growing up were much more important to guides than boys, clothes, make-up, being trendy or indeed being a guide. </p> <p>The Guide Association denies that the new programme is part of a wider rebranding exercise for the organisation. It isn't a desperate bid to draw in new girls to replace those who exit yawning, say officials, it's simply part of the organisation's evolution since a group of teenage girls sneaked into the first ever scout jamboree held in Crystal Palace in 1909. They disguised themselves in scout uniforms. When Baden Powell rumbled them in the middle of the event they demanded the right to join the scouts and he eventually agreed, setting up the Guide Association the following year. </p> <p>The new changes to the guiding programme are the first since 1968. The emphasis is on working in smaller groups of six and choosing the activity you fancy. Eye-catching new packs called Go For It have been designed around five themes: healthy lifestyle, global awareness, discovery, skills and relationships and celebrating diversity. Activities, old and new, are outlined - the stuff about building a campfire and working out where north is when you haven't got a compass is still there, but has been supplemented with tips on safety and survival in urban areas. </p> <p>So is this the kind of thing that girls entering their teenage years want, and are the core values of girl guiding - building self-esteem, taking on new challenges and achieving their potential - still relevant to them? Has working as a team and serving the community become obsolete in our increasingly individualised society? </p> <p>For Hannah Orsler, 12, no amount of shiny activity packs and promises on postcards that \"being a guide is all about getting together with other cool girls and having fun and laughs... without the lads\", will convince her to join up. \"Two of my friends are guides and they say it's really good but I didn't like the brown and yellow uniform and thought the whole thing sounded a bit babyish and old-fashioned. I imagine it to be loads of girls sitting round a table doing knitting and sewing.\" And those who are guides get teased by peers at school, more since starting secondary school than at primary school, and more by boys than by girls. \"Going to a youth group here I can do activities with boys and girls. This is more my idea of fun than being in a girls-only group.\" </p> <p>But Erica Bell, who has faithfully stuck with the Guide Association since the age of five when she was a Rainbow and is now 15, disagrees. \"When I was younger some of the activities were quite boring but there's much more choice now. A lot of my friends go to guides and although there's a bit of teasing at school we don't care. It's nice for us girls to have our own space without boys who can be very stupid at this age and just mess around. I think one of the most important things I've got from guides is the chance and the confidence to try new things. Even if you find you don't like something it's always worth having a try.\" </p> <p>Her mum Sue, a guide leader, thinks it's important that girls have an environment where they can let their hair down and not be affected by what boys think. \"Girls are much more streetwise these days and they're getting older younger, but at the end of the day they still want to have a good time.\" </p> <p>One thing that girls inside and outside the guides agree upon is that during their early teenage years they just want to have fun. How they do that keeps changing but, in a society where the culture of self takes centre stage, enticing teenage girls into organised groups is proving a continuing challenge. </p> <p>\u0095 For more information about the guides, visit <a href=\"http://www.guides.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.guides.org.uk</a></p>",
  "A US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut drifted out of the space shuttle Atlantis yesterday, making a successful climb of the international space station. <p>Edward Lu and Yuri Malenchenko laid cable and installed a boom for a navigation unit during their 6-hour spacewalk. </p> <p>The spacewalkers ventured 33 metres from the cargo bay. It was the furthest any Nasa spacewalker had ventured while tethered. </p> <p>\"Got a great view back at the nose of the shuttle,\" Mr Lu, who was on his first spacewalk, said. His partner had performed spacewalks while living aboard Russia's Mir space station. </p> <p>The spacewalk official at mission control, Mike Hess, compared the foray to working on the 11th storey of a 13-storey building. </p> <p>The work went flawlessly, and ended 16 minutes ahead of schedule even with the addition of a brief task, the manual extension of a docking target that had not deployed properly. </p> <p>\"There wasn't really anything else to do on space station and won't be, really, until the next crew gets up there,\" Mr Hess said. </p> <p>To get to the top of the station, Mr Lu and Mr Malenchenko ascended hand-over-hand like rock climbers. They were slowed by a multitude of obstructions such as antennas and docking targets.</p>",
  "The government is considering making immigration policy even more market-orientated by making a work permit dependent on a job offer \"at sufficiently high level\" rather than simply letting in people with skills in fields like IT. <p>The need to further streamline the system to meet the challenges of the globalised economy and an ageing home population was revealed yesterday by the Home Office minister, Barbara Roche, as part of a Whitehall initiative to open a debate on immigration. </p> <p>In a speech at the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank in London she linked America's long economic boom to the 11m migrants admitted during the 90s and warned that Germany's break with tradition by offering citizenship to Indian IT specialists had not attracted the numbers expected. </p> <p>\"The market for skilled labour is a global market and not necessarily a buyer's market,\" said the minister, who noted that changes to immigration policy in such countries as Canada and Australia were also designed to stress flexible and transferable skills. </p> <p>Though the government has already made it easier for people with skills, business experience and good ideas to enter Britain, ministers may now go further. </p> <p>Mrs Roche said Britain could \"make a permit contingent primarily on a job offer at a sufficiently high level, rather than seeking to identify employment sectors with shortages\". </p> <p>Britain could also follow the US, Mrs Roche suggested, in holding \"programmes of induction and guidance. We could attach greater symbolic importance to the achievement of UK citizenship\". </p> <p>Mrs Roche, MP for Hornsey in north London and herself the descendant of Polish-Jewish migrants, was speaking with Tony Blair's blessing as ministers seek to change the suspicious public mood towards immigration this year. </p> <p>Tabloid backed anger has been fuelled by the post-Kosovo wave of refugees and other recent arrivals from south and east Europe and beyond, including Romanian Gypsies and the Chinese stowaways found suffocated in a lorry at Dover. While insisting that genuine asylum seekers will always be welcome, ministers also want voters to grasp that, far from being a threat, \"managed migration\" in the economic sense has a long and fruitful history in Britain. </p> <p>Mrs Roche cited Shami Ahmed, the founder of Joe Bloggs clothing company, and 200 Asian multimillionaires as examples of economic migrants - some refugees - who enriched themselves and the country. </p> <p>Downing Street, which has shown a close interest in Mrs Roche's text, knows it is walking a tightrope. Yesterday the minister acknowledged that the high number of asylum seekers in the last year was \"unfortunate\" because it \"skewed\" the migration debate. </p> <p>Mrs Roche said: \"Asylum procedures are increasingly being misused by those who have no real fear of persecution. This degrades the integrity of the system and rewards the people traffickers. </p> <p>\"I fully understand public concern about the asylum system and about the wider threat to a properly regulated system of immigration control.\"</p>",
  "Six years after his banishment to the wilderness, the Italian parliament returned from its summer holiday yesterday to find Silvio Berlusconi making a spectacular comeback as leader of the centre-right opposition. <p>Later this month he will try to topple the government and trigger a snap general election, which the polls say he will win.</p> <p>He has mobilised his family, yacht and media empire for an American-style campaign of glamour and money.</p> <p>Posters with his tanned, beaming face are appearing on billboards in advance of his attack on the government's budget, which may lead to a confidence vote.</p> <p>Mr Berlusconi, 64, returned to Rome with 25 \"recipes\" for a better future devised with advisers at his Bermuda holiday home. He will board his yacht next weekend for a campaign cruise to signal the countdown to his restoration as prime minister, the job he lost in 1994 after seven tumultuous months.</p> <p>His daughter Marina, 34, vice-president of his holding company Fininvest, has posed in a black bikini for the lifestyle magazine Oggi, which described her as a powerful businesswoman with a super-feminine physique.</p> <p>Kristen Pazik, the girlfriend of his son Pier Silvio, posed nude for GQ magazine. She described her potential father-in-law as the most fascinating man in the world.</p> <p>But Sergio Romano, a commentator tipped to be foreign minister in a Berlusconi cabinet, warned that flaunting success and beauty might alienate traditionalists. \"For every vote he gains from the Bermuda villa image, he loses one,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Berlusconi, who owns AC Milan football club and whose family controls the private television network Mediaset, has shaken off most of the corruption allegations which dogged him through the 90s.</p> <p>He launched a new era in Italian electioneering when he made a 37,000-tonne cruiser ship his Forza Italia party headquarters for last April's regional elections.</p> <p>The nine-party government coalition, which includes Marxists, Greens, and former Christian Democrats, hopes to revive its popularity with a tax-cutting budget.</p> <p>It is split on whether to dump the technocrat prime minister, Giuliano Amato. To counter Mr Berlusconi's charisma there is a growing clamour to install the telegenic mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, who would be a fresh face untainted by corruption.</p>",
  "Fourteen young girls from a French home for people with learning disabilities have been sterilised without their knowledge over the past five years, a lawyer has claimed. <p>Acting for a local association for the mentally handicapped, the lawyer, Pierre Gonzales de Gaspard, yesterday filed a formal request for a criminal investigation with the Yonne district court in Sens, some 50 miles south-west of Paris.</p> <p>\"These girls form a captive target and are completely incapable of resisting those who have full authority over them,\" he said. \"But they are not guinea pigs, or sex objects. It is imperative that these practices stop and that those responsible be punished.\"</p> <p>The association, known by its initials ADHY, says it has conclusive evidence from a care assistant and at least one parent that hysterectomies were performed on the girls at five different hospitals in the region.</p> <p>It said the girls were escorted to hospital by an unidentified nurse from the home, the Aid through Work Centre in Sens, and were never told the true purpose of the operations they underwent.</p> <p>\"We are not making these accusation lightly,\" ADHY chairman, Pierre Manoir, said. \"We have evidence and witnesses and these people know that untrue testimony would make them liable to prosecution.\"</p> <p>The director of the home, which allows men and women to mix freely and, according to French media reports, has in the past boasted of its \"healthy lack of institutional restraints\", declined all comment on the allegations.</p> <p>But a local social services official, Marie-Chantal Aucouturier, appeared to admit they were well founded. \"This case raises the very difficult question of the sexuality of the mentally handicapped,\" she said. \"But such practices have now stopped.\"</p> <p>Under French law, hysterectomies and vasectomies may be performed only in cases of medical necessity after thorough examination of the patient and consultation with them, their family or legal guardian, and their doctor.</p> <p>But Nadine Diedrich, a research scientist and author of a 1998 study of the practice, said that while sterilisation of people with learning disabilities in France was not systematic, it was far more widespread than assumed.</p> <p>\"The sexual conduct of the mentally ill can be very disturbing,\" she said.</p> <p>\"That is why this practice exists. But no figures whatsoever are available.\"</p>",
  "Two protesters swam 150 metres in wetsuits to a Trident nuclear submarine and smashed equipment with a hammer to gain publicity for their cause, a court heard yesterday. <p>Rachel Wenham, 28, from Leeds, and Rosie James, 25, from London, who are activists from the nuclear disarmament group, Trident Ploughshares, hung a banner saying \"women want peace\" from the conning tower of HMS Vengeance which was berthed at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in February last year, Dennis Watson, prosecuting, told Manchester crown court. </p> <p>They took a hammer to testing equipment then spray painted \"Peace, no more death\" and \"Hiroshima\" slogans on the side of the submarine which was designed to carry one quarter of Britain's nuclear arsenal. </p> <p>Both women denied two charges each of causing criminal damage. </p> <p>Mr Watson said that damage to \"sophisticated and purpose built\" equipment would cost thousands of pounds to repair. </p> <p>He added that the women surrendered when they were noticed by security guards. \"Part of their purpose was to be apprehended. They were heard to say that they had missed the newspapers.\" He said this referred to the publicity they sought. </p> <p>The court heard that Ms Wenham said that she was acting to prevent a crime because she believed the nuclear programme was illegal. She claimed she was justified under international law. </p> <p>The trial continues today.</p>",
  "<p>Labour officials have rubbished Tory proposals for universities to be privatised. However, they appear to be on collision course with academic heads, who this week are considering privatisation and top-up fees as options to avert the funding crisis in higher education. </p> <p>Labour advisers say that radical Tory plans to fund universities through one-off endowments and end state grants would impose huge top-up fees on middle-class students and parents. \"The Tories don't even know what universities would participate,\" a statement said. \"The plan will cost nearly \u00a380bn in England alone and there is no detail as to where the billions would come from.\" </p> <p>The draft Conservative election manifesto plans to free universities from red tape and government control have set the tone for the highly charged political debate over university funding in the run-up to the next general election. The Tories say that universities would be endowed with money from government windfalls from future privatisation proceeds and asset sales. But they would prevent academic institutions charging top-up fees in the short term. </p> <p>Labour officials argue that the government would be powerless to stop universities charging extra fees under such a scheme. They have also attacked calls to abolish current tuition fees for university students, unveiled last week by the Liberal Democrats in their pre-manifesto document. </p> <p>Labour are likely to stick to existing policies for universities, where fees are restricted by the government to a flat rate of \u00a31,050 a year for students from the richest backgrounds. And the university funding issue may not even warrant a mention in the election manifesto. </p> <p>But privatisation is certainly on the universities' own agenda when vice-chancellors discuss future funding options for the sector during their annual conference. Universities would be able to opt out of state control and set their own level of fees under one of the proposals in a report by Sir William Taylor, former head of Hull, Huddersfield and Thames Valley universities. </p> <p>Universities say they can't deliver what politicians, employers, students and the public expect from them in the face of continuing funding cuts. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals wants a political commitment to a major review of higher education in the next Parliament. </p> <p>Under the privatisation option being presented, universities would have to set aside bursaries for 20% of undergraduates who are from the poorest backgrounds. Other options include higher upfront tuition fees with income-contingent loans; means tested fees increased by 10% each year; fees for limited numbers of courses; full costs fees and scholarships. \"The secretary of state has called for a vigorous debate on higher education funding, on which it appears the government has not yet made up its mind and may not at present be of one mind,\" claims the report for vice-chancellors. </p> <p>Vice-chancellors will be asked to fill in a questionnaire to vote on what issues should influence funding decisions. These range from concerns over student access and acceptibility to students and parents to the revenue potential for institutions and the electoral risk associated with any political backers. Detailed modelling of the funding options will not be completed until the end of the year. </p> <p>Student leaders meanwhile have also attacked the Tory proposals. \"The Conservatives' talk of ensuring some 'access for students from poor backgrounds', though sounding good in principle, begins to resemble the financially elitist funding formula for universities in the US, with Victorian-style handouts to pauper students,\" a statement from the Aldwych Group said. The group shadows the 20 elite university heads of the Russell Group and aims to counteract elitism. </p> <p>Higher education minister Baroness Blackstone will be among the speakers discussing the future of universities during meetings organised by the CVCP and the Association of University Teachers at the Labour party conference in Bournemouth next week.</p>",
  "<p>Our generation has never known a time when corporal punishment was allowed, so it is difficult for us to understand that some teachers may feel poorly equipped now that the cane has gone. Most teachers, too, recognise the sanity of the 1987 legislation, which protects children's rights in the classroom. From our experience, it is a dwindling minority who still favour the clip around the ear or rap across the knuckles - though they may feel strengthened when cases such as headteacher Marjorie Evans' hit the headlines. </p> <p>For most of the pupils we spoke to, the issue was not how children could be forced to behave better, but how teachers could be encouraged to treat their pupils better. Holly, 15, rejects corporal punishment. \"It is wrong to hit kids; you could shout at them, give them detention, but you shouldn't hit them.\" Most pupils respect their teachers, she believes, but warns, \"if the teacher is cheeky to them, they'll be cheeky back.\" </p> <p>Primary school student Conor, 10, agrees: \"As we grow up we become more unruly and less like sheep.\" </p> <p>By the time pupils reach adolescence, they will react very badly to a teacher who tries to control them. \"As young people grow and start developing into adults they are going to push the teacher and try to get independence,\" says 17-year-old schoolboy Ryan, \"and teachers try, in a sense, to take this independence away.\" This only causes trouble, he thinks, if there are problems at home: \"Sometimes young people push to the absolute limits, sometimes maybe it is to get a thrill to see what the teacher is going to do, but basically, it depends on the child's background. If the child knows that their parents will do nothing, he or she will continually push.\" </p> <p>Ryan believes that those students who constantly land themselves in trouble need counselling, not more punishment. \"Parents and schools have to work in partnership when a child's behaviour becomes an issue.\" </p> <p>According to some of the young people we interviewed, physical reprimand is still sometimes used in the classroom (and they weren't talking about duster lobbing or a little arm grabbing - none of which was considered threatening, but simply a sign that a teacher had \"lost their cool\"). </p> <p>For lower-sixth student Drew, 17, it all boils down to mutual respect. </p> <p>\"Teachers who are very calm and talk things through are the best. They get more respect because you can relate to them and be on more of an equal footing,\" he says. </p> <p>The message being clearly written on the blackboard by young people is that they want an ounce of respect and their views to be heard. </p> <p>\u0095 Children's Express is a programme of learning through journalism for eight- to 18-year-olds.

  "<p>Until a decade ago, education was a secret garden for many parents. While most parents now know something of their school's exam results and inspection reports, there has been a glaring gap in understanding what is actually being taught to youngsters through the curriculum in different phases of education. Today we hope to fill the gap. </p> <p>Mori research last year found that a third of parents did not feel very confident talking to teachers about their children's work or supporting their children doing their homework. When we talked further to parents, we found they wanted to know more about what goes on day to day in school; and with the right tips, many are more than willing to play a bigger role. Over 40% of parents asked for practical help with maths and 30% wanted guidance on how to encourage children to do their homework. </p> <p>That is why Tony Blair and I are launching a new package of materials for parents today, backed by national TV advertising. The package includes guides to the new national curriculum, special practical subject leaflets, a revamped parents' website and a new termly parents' magazine. </p> <p>Parents are a child's first educator. But whilst parents' role in pre-school is widely recognised, support provided in the home can also make a real difference as children go through school. </p> <p>I know sometimes people say government tries to preach or nanny people too much. But today's campaign is the exact opposite of that approach. It offers a practical guide to the curriculum and tips for those parents who want them. Arming parents with the facts about what's happening in their children's school not only gives them the chance to play a part at home, it empowers them to play a supportive role at school with teachers, too; and it narrows the gap between \"those in the know\" and those unfamiliar with the complexities of the education system. </p> <p>We found that this worked in the National Year of Reading and Maths Year 2000, when millions of leaflets offering practical tips were taken by parents, who told us how valuable they found them. </p> <p>I also know there are some parents who make life a misery for teachers: either by failing to ensure children turn up for classes or by verbally and even physically abusing teachers. We are tackling those problems. But the irresponsibility of a small minority of parents should not distract us from offering the majority of parents the practical support they want. </p> <p>The campaign will use a number of approaches to help parents overcome their concerns about getting more involved in their children's education. </p> <p>The Parents' Guides to the National Curriculum show parents just what their children learn at school and how they can help. There are three guides: one for parents of three- to seven-year-olds, one for parents of seven- to 11-year-olds, and one for parents of secondary pupils [see parents' reviews below]. </p> <p>The guides offer all sorts of ideas for parents, for example when your child has just started primary school, ask them specific questions. What have they done well at? What is more difficult? This helps parents to see what a child is doing and helps children to think about their work. </p> <p>There are plenty of everyday situations where parents can help children aged seven to 11. If they get a takeaway, for instance, they can let their child plan it. Give them a certain amount to spend and see if they succeed in ordering what everyone wants without breaking the budget! </p> <p>For teenagers, revision for exams is best if it's active. Try getting your child to take you through the main points - it is a really good way of consolidating learning. </p> <p>Parents can pick the guides up from schools and libraries, order a free copy (08000 96 66 26) or find them on the web. Parents, children and teachers have \"road-tested\" the guides, and most teaching unions back them, too. </p> <p>We are also publishing a magazine. Parents and Schools magazine will address topical issues - its first issue looks at how to tackle bullying, offers advice on literacy and numeracy and using the internet safely. It is an easy way for busy parents to find out about important school issues. It will be available from retail outlets, including Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Budgens and Lloyds Pharmacies, and from libraries and doctors' surgeries or by calling 0800 389 3899. </p> <p>From today our parents' website is being expanded, giving parents more access to the web. The site includes information on all aspects of education - from bullying and school meals to the curriculum. Its search facility allows parents to hunt for a school in their area and check its results. An interactive map gives information about interesting days out for children - from theme parks and pop concerts to city farms and medieval tournaments. The site is <a href=\"http://www.parents.dfee.gov.uk\">www.parents.dfee.gov.uk</a>. </p> <p>Next week we are holding a parents online week (September 18-22). Most schools now have internet access and children are picking up computer and internet skills in the classroom. But computers can be daunting for parents who feel left behind by new technology. Parents online week will give parents a chance to see what computers can do for their family and their children's education. </p> <p>A further plank of the campaign is the publication of the first 12 topic guides, which will arm parents with essential information on popular school topics, such as: electricity, Romans or plants. For example, the Romans leaflet gives ideas for places to visit, and shows you how to make a Roman mosaic with your child. The leaflets can be found on the web at <a href=\"http://www.parents.dfee.gov.uk/discover\">www.parents.dfee.gov.uk/discover </a></p> <p>Taken together, this package opens education to parents in a way which we hope will engage many who may have been put off getting involved in school. Ministers have long said that parents are essential partners in their children's education - with this extra practical support, we are helping to turn that slogan into a reality. </p> <p> \u0095 David Blunkett is Secretary of State for Education and Employment.</p>",
  "<p>El \u00e9xito en negocio requiere el entrenamiento y la disciplina y el duro trabajo - and in the future, being able to understand this David Rockefeller quotation will be a big help, too. </p> <p>Pupils at St John the Baptist school in Woking are beginning to realise this. They know that the ability to speak a foreign language not only helps on holiday, but also makes you infinitely more employable. </p> <p>The school recently won a European language award from the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research. The judges praised the way in which languages are infused into all areas of the curriculum. It's not unusual for a maths lesson to be conducted in German, for example, or a skeleton labelled in French during a biology lesson. As part of a recent design and technology project, pupils made pop-up books written in a variety of languages. </p> <p>A significant part of this is the \"international week\", which has been held at the school in June/July for the past three years. Thanks to the work of Mary Dingle, co-ordinator, the week now attracts many speakers and uses different methods to show that languages are enjoyable as well as invaluable in the new European context. </p> <p>The fun aspects are communicated during the week through such games as \"bridge the gap\". In teams, pupils answer questions about Europe - a correct response earns a token, which is used to build a bridge from Britain to France. The first one to Calais wins. </p> <p>In the past Sir Anthony Meyer, a former Tory MP, has helped year 12 pupils to participate in a mock European parliamentary election. British Airways has made a presentation to year 8 classes, emphasising that having another language is essential in today's air industry. Mr Fuhrig, of the Goethe Institute, has used games to demonstrate the importance of other languages and cultures. </p> <p>Dingle says that to get speakers to attend the week, it is simply a matter of asking them. She tries to introduce new elements each year, and hopes to boast an international footballer next year. \"I approached Chelsea football club, who said they'd be very keen to be involved but as it coincided with Euro 2000, it wasn't feasible. But I'm optimistic of getting them involved next year, which would particularly interest the boys.\" </p> <p>Not all events revolve around outside speakers. The school canteen was transformed during European cafe day and staff dressed in the national costumes of France, Germany and Italy. Pupils then had to order what they wanted in the appropriate language. </p> <p>While international week mainly focuses on Europe, the school also aims to raise awareness of the rest of the world. A Japanese intern visits the school annually for six months, teaching the language, culture and even the odd martial arts lesson. Dingle realises that pupils will not all be fluent Japanese speakers at the end of this, but she says this is all part of \"immersing pupils in other cultures\". </p> <p>This approach has paid dividends. Dingle reports that there is a bigger uptake of languages at GCSE level, with improved results and more pupils continuing their studies post-16. This is partly because the school makes it possible to combine languages with other options. </p> <p>In line with this philosophy, St John offers GNVQ programmes with a language option. Dr Holgar Briel from Surrey University's linguistics department spoke to year 12 and 13 pupils about the opportunities in higher education to combine languages with law, business, etc. </p> <p>Ani Magill, headteacher at St John, points out that many commentators warn that Britain still has a distinct lack of people with the necessary knowledge of languages to compete in today's industries. Over the next 20 years, the world market is set to alter dramatically - Mandarin and Spanish, for instance, will be the languages of the future. </p> <p>The study of a foreign language can help you to win friends and influence people - or at least those under 16. This year Stephen Fawkes, a senior education officer and project manager for the BBC, opened the international week by singing a Spice Girls song - entirely in French.</p>"
