  "<p>Claudio Ranieri is not one to waste a moment in his quest to take Chelsea to the top. While waiting for the team's flight at Heathrow yesterday morning the new Italian coach and his assistants could be seen practising English with the club's interpreter. </p> <p>\"Twentee, thirtee, fortee,\" the trio repeated parrot-fashion, though the significance of that particular numerical choice was unclear. Maybe this is the range of push-ups the reportedly disciplinarian Ranieri plans to introduce as punishment for players who flag on the training ground. </p> <p>Two sessions a day now under the new regime; a necessary hardship, Ranieri believes, if Chelsea are to banish the inconsistency that has dogged them. </p> <p>\"A great team has to be able to play against any team,\" said the coach, pointing to Chelsea's problems beating the minnows in the footballing pond. \"My philosophy is to have a lot of tactical solutions. And players have to adapt themselves to various solutions. To do this you need a lot of training sessions.\" </p> <p>So although an excursion in the Worthington Cup of Europe appears to be a distraction from Ranieri's main assignment of winning the Premiership, it does offer him a chance to try out his ant-crushing plans with his new charges. </p> <p>St Gallen are to Europe what Bradford are to the Premiership, a small-town visitor to the big city. But it is precisely Chelsea's habit of slipping up against the sort of teams they should be beating that has undermined Ken Bates's plans to win a trophy big enough to match his ego. </p> <p>The little Swiss club have to play this match in Zurich because their own ground is too small, but they showed in the first leg at Stamford Bridge that they possess the ability to embarrass Chelsea. </p> <p>Compact, well organised and dangerous on the break, they managed to restrict the home side to a one-goal win, though admittedly their task was made easier by the despondency of a Chelsea team in shock after the sacking of Gianluca Vialli two days earlier. </p> <p>Yesterday Gianfranco Zola took the opportunity to deny reports that he played a part in Vialli's downfall. \"My conscience is clear,\" he said. \"I wish I had that power.\" </p> <p>But already Ranieri has moved to restore unity. \"I will accept any result if the players have played with their hearts,\" he said yesterday. And, of course, that is exactly what Chelsea did in his first game in charge, coming back from 3-1 down to draw at Manchester United. It is the sort of spirit that will be required tonight. </p> <p>Tactically, Ranieri is expected to stick by the 4-3-3 formation that Chelsea have used of late, even though Marcel Desailly is out injured and Dennis Wise faces a late fitness check. </p> <p> <strong> Chelsea</strong> (probable): Cudicini; Panucci, Bogarde, Leboeuf, Le Saux; Di Matteo, Melchiot, Morris or Wise; Zola, Flo, Hasselbaink. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Concept music is silly by nature, but there's something especially absurd about Calexico. Like the town from which they take their name, their music sits plumb on the border between California and Mexico, or at least between the California and Mexico of old westerns, those expansive deserts populated by sly muchachos, scowling drifters, and beautiful women who lure the latter into their boudoirs only to steal their wallets and throw their pants to the hogs. </p> <p>On Hot Rail, Calexico's recent third album, the accumulation of celluloid cliches is subtly executed: the brass breezes gently, the slide guitar lilts in the background, the mood is hazy, meditative, dark. The more accurately it's reproduced on stage, the less interesting it sounds. Joined on stage by a double bassist and a pair on trumpet and vibraphone, singer/guitarist Joey Burns and drummer John Convertino conjure images of clacking spurs, smoky saloons, men in ponchos fixing for a duel, even in one of London's plush former theatres. But they do so only when they play to the hilt, when the trumpets blare, when Burns bends his strings into extravagant Morricone-styled riffs. </p> <p>Their first 10 songs, including a muted rendition of Service and Repair and a disappointingly flat version of the gorgeous Fade, are pleasant but lack verve. Calexico need their gimmicks: the more ridiculous their performance, the more engaging they are. </p> <p>Just in time for the Hispanic trills of Tres Avisos, something happens. On troops a five-piece mariachi band: mischievous, brilliant musicians sporting bell-trimmed trousers and huge sombreros, whose aim is to chuck chilli powder over Burns and Convertino's songs. With their vibrant accompaniment, the brass-laden Stray has thrilling power, while the Hazlewood and Sinatra-inspired duet Ballad of Cable Hogue exhilarates, not least because Burns is also joined by a pistol-toting Frenchwoman who sings her role of murderous seducer with brio. Of course it's possible to go too far over the top: the encore closes with improvised party music more usually heard at tacky beach resorts. But it doesn't stop you looking for a horse and dusty cowboy to take you home when you leave.</p>",
  "<p>If ever Arsenal needed the home fires of their Champions League ambitions to burn bright it will be tonight when Lazio, the Italian champions and one of the tournament favourites, visit Highbury. </p> <p>Lazio are not unbeatable; Valencia proved as much in last season's quarter-finals when they won the opening leg 5-2. But Sven-Goran Eriksson, the Rome club's Swedish coach, now enjoys an even more formidable set of options after spending \u00a352m on two Argentine strikers, Hernan Crespo from Parma and Claudio Lopez from Valencia. </p> <p>Crespo is unfit, but an Arsenal defence heavily dependent on the match fitness of Tony Adams will still have to cope with Claudio Lopez and Simone Inzaghi. </p> <p>The importance of Adams's authority at the back was re-emphasised when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger rested him at Ipswich on Saturday. Arsenal cannot risk a repetition of the bizarre first half they experienced against Shakhtar Donetsk at Highbury a week ago when the Ukrainians scored twice in four minutes. Against Lazio it would take more than the heroics of Martin Keown to turn a similar situation around tonight. </p> <p>No doubt the passions of the crowd spurred Arsenal on last Wednesday, something which was not quite working for them when they were playing their home legs at Wembley. \"In our minds we will be playing at home tomorrow and our opponents will be away,\" Wenger explained. \"At Wembley we didn't really play at home while our opponents didn't really play away.\" </p> <p>Wenger will decide today who is to partner Thierry Henry up front, with Nwankwo Kanu a better bet than Dennis Bergkamp or Sylvain Wiltord after the Nigerian's important contribution to the recovery against Shakhtar. Provided Henry gets the service, his pace should test even Alessandro Nesta, who defended so well for Italy in Euro 2000. </p> <p>First, however, Arsenal will look to Patrick Vieira to help them gain control of midfield, where Lazio are especially strong with two Argentines, Diego Simeone and Juan Veron, flanked by a Yugoslav, Dejan Stankovic, and the shrewd Czech Pavel Nedved. </p> <p>With Manchester United at Highbury on Sunday, tonight marks the start of an important five days for Arsenal. Although the outcome of neither match will decide anything, the results will give an early indication of Arsenal's true potential this season. </p> <p> <strong> Arsenal </strong> (probable): Seaman; Luzhny, Keown, Adams, Silvinho; Parlour, Grimandi, Vieira, Ljungberg; Kanu, Henry. </p> <p><strong> Lazio</strong> (probable): Marchegiani; Negro, Nesta, Mihajlovic, Pancaro; Stankovic, Simeone, Veron, Nedved; Claudio Lopez, Inzaghi.</p>",
  "<p>When the doors of Armley jail clang shut behind a new black or Asian inmate, followed by that other prison sound, the rattle of keys, one of the surprises inside is an almost immediate visit from Shaqil Murtaza or Jason Khan. The two men provide a unique inside welcome, aimed at a worrying mismatch in prison statistics. </p> <p>Blacks and Asians are over-represented in British jails and under-represented in the take-up of social care and housing after release - programmes with a proven record of cutting second crimes, keeping families together and saving the country a lot of public money. </p> <p>Niggling away at the problem prompted Khan, 33 and an instinctive doer, to do something; he invented a pioneer scheme called Habap - Housing action for black and Asian prisoners - which has just won its second national award. </p> <p>One of a series of odd acronyms (others include Lypht, Lilt and Thync) which appeal to the punsters of Leeds-based Foundation Housing, the project sounds to Asian ears like the Arabic word for \"lovely\" - habib or habab. In an unlovely world, it produces some upbeat images: here is Khan prompting a group of Rasta visitors to Armley to gasp: \"Cool, it's a Paki with keys.\" Here is Murtaza startling a new and large Afro-Caribbean arrival by being, firstly black, and secondly, starting the conversation by asking where the man would like to live when he gets out. </p> <p>Bringing that sort of hope is in the great tradition of British prison reformers and one of the reasons for Habap landing a Margery Fry award from the Howard League for Penal Reform, now followed by top prize in this year's Race and Diversity Awards, presented by the National Housing Federation and the Federation of Black Housing Organisations. </p> <p>Like Fry, Khan and Murtaza have also earned the respect of most traditionally-minded prison officers at Armley who initially had doubts about an ethnically targeted project. </p> <p>Khan won them over with his obvious eagerness, a folio of statistics on the prison/care mismatch for blacks and a sympathy with the old dilemma between wanting to punish and needing to reform. </p> <p>In Habap's lair, Khan says: \"It's hard, if you've been a victim of crime, if you've woken up to find someone standing over your bed, to think of them as a victim of circumstances. But there's no question that that person can change, if you set out to be open-minded and non-judgmental.\" </p> <p>The ethnic targeting has a downside; the tension between the dangers of singling out the black and Asian minority and the benefits of meeting their specific needs. The problem has been eased by the arrival of Ian Summerskill, a Foundation Housing colleague, to tune up Harp (Housing Advice and Resettlement Project) another acronym aimed at Armley's white majority. But Khan and Murtaza don't want to dodge the issue. </p> <p>\"Our project is still virtually unique because so many prisons say: 'We haven't got a problem; we can deal with this sort of thing ourselves', but then don't,\" says Khan. \"Time and again, you come up against the popular myths like 'they'll look after their own' or 'blacks always get somewhere to live'\". </p> <p>Out of 1,400 prisoners who have seen Khan and Murtaza since 1998, only two have refused their help - one who was completely out of it on drugs and the other because his after-prison plans were well fixed. </p> <p>The problems facing the others have been satisfyingly technical; rather than offering tea and sympathy, Khan and Murtaza have helped to inform local councils of legal provisions like the right to housing benefit for 52 weeks for prisoners on remand. </p> <p>They have also raised issues like the lack of knowledge among local magistrates about housing grant small print; the fact that benefits last for 13 weeks in prison, but not beyond, does not figure in sentencing policy as much as it should. </p> <p>Khan is dispirited about a similar example of over-arthritic justice which is threatening to undo nearly two years of patient work with a young Habap contact. Delays in the legal system mean that the man has only just been sentenced to more than a year in Armley for crimes committed, more than two years ago. </p> <p>\"The punishment fits the crime, I'm not arguing about that,\" says Khan. \"But the effect of a year inside is that he faces losing a college course he's organised and the flat we helped him get. This is someone who has tried to change his ways and make a go of it. Now it looks as if it's all kicked out from under him and of course he's bitter with 'the system'. Back to square one.\" </p> <p>Except it won't be; thanks to Habap, the man's housing association landlord is likely to hold the flat - partly because of the group's record in playing fair in the opposite direction. When Khan or Murtaza find that inmates are going to be in prison for so long that their tenancies are bound to be forfeit, they inform councils promptly and return the keys. </p> <p>\"Quite often,\" says Khan, \"it can take them weeks to discover that a tenant's inside, just as they're sometimes not up to speed with the details of housing benefit law.\" </p> <p> Habap was recently visited by Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, who joined a long line of dignitaries in praising the group's work. Unfortunately, praise alone cannot keep them afloat and the state of Habap's finances is perilous; the group is deep into a National Lottery Charities Board application - sure sign of severe problems - and needs \u00a330,000 to avoid a deficit in its current financial year ending next month. </p> <p>Ramsbotham wasn't optimistic but the great hope is that the Home Office will help, encouraged by the \u00a318,000 put in by Armley itself, where the last governor, Rannoch Daly, and his successor, Stacey Tasker, the first woman to head the jail in its 150 years, are Habap fans. </p> <p>Post Macpherson report, the awards and the setting up of Harp also point to a wider pilot. \"When black or Asian prisoners transfer here from other jails,\" says Khan (who also visits three smaller Yorkshire prisons, including a women's unit) \"they can be even more surprised to find us than the new inmates.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Habap can be contacted on 0113 234 1693 or at <a href=\"http://www.foundationhsg.demon.co.uk\">www.foundationhsg.demon.co.uk </a> </p> <p><strong>Prison figures in black and white</strong> </p> <p>Prisoners from minority ethnic groups make up 18% of all men in jail in England and Wales and 25% of all women. This compares to minority ethnic strength of 6.5% in the population as a whole. </p> <p>Of 61,000 male prisoners classified last year, 12% were black, 3% south Asian and 3% \"Chinese and other\". Of 3,000 women, the proportions were 19% black, 1% south Asian and 5% Chinese and other. </p> <p>In all, more than 12,000 prisoners are from minority ethnic groups. Their representation appears to be growing: in 1998-99, the prison population shrank 2%, but numbers of minority ethnic prisoners rose 1%. </p> <p>Contrary to popular prejudice, black male prisoners are less likely than white to be serving terms for violent or sexual offences. But they are more likely to be in jail for robbery or drug crimes. Of sentenced black prisoners, 65% are serving terms of four years or more, compared to 50% of whites. </p> <p><strong> David Brindle</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>HEY, REFER(EE)! LEAVE OUR DAVE ALONE!</strong> </p> <p>The Fiver has dubbed it \"Koogan's first law\" - and nobody who values our national game can afford to ignore it. Simply put, it states that whatever comes out of Kelvin Koogan's mouth always has an equal and opposite reaction.

United were losing 3-1 and the game was drifting into injury time when the supposedly reformed Beckham got himself booked for dissent. But worse still, instead of shaking German referee's Markus Merk's hand and wishing him the best of bully, he then turned and spat on the ground in his general direction! Luckily for Beckham, Uefa aren't going to slap a punitive fine and a long suspension on him for his behaviour. But just in case they were thinking about it, the Imperial Lord Ferg has sprung to the petulant one's defence.</p> <p>The second rule of football - just behind Koogan's first law - is that the Lord Ferg will always, always stick up for his players in public. Well, until he needs to shift a few more units of his autobiography. And today was no different. \"It's understandable,\" said the United boss, talking about Beckham's reaction and not the wild celebrations that took place after United got beat. \"They get frustrated with the referee. The referee is supposed to be at the top of his job - that's the reputation he's got.

But with the way things went on Sunday I don't think it would have been right.\"</p> <p>While the Foxes' many Stanley fans were putting the words \"D'\" and \"Oh\" together, Mr Taylor went on. \"I am fully aware of how popular Stan is with certain sections of Leicester fans and this is the last thing I wanted to do,\" he said. \"They might think that we will lose because he is not playing on Thursday.

  "<p>Gliding through a moonlit sky, space shuttle Atlantis returned from the newly furnished international space station, soon to be home to a permanent crew. </p> <p>Within moments of Atlantis' touchdown, the clocks in Mission Control began counting backward toward the next launch. In one of the faster turnarounds at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Discovery is scheduled to blast off October 5 with new space station parts. </p> <p>The space agency prefers a minimum of 21 days between shuttle launches. If Discovery soars on time, the gap will be 27 days. </p> <p>\"They did an amazing job this mission,\" flight director Jeff Bantle said. \"This moved us, I would say, a significant step closer to getting a crew on board this vehicle.\" </p> <p>The first full-time residents of the space station - Nasa astronaut Bill Shepherd and two Russian cosmonauts - are scheduled to blast off aboard a Russian rocket from Kazakhstan on October 30, following a delay of more than two years. </p> <p>They were in Russia, training for their four-month mission, when Atlantis touched down after 12 days aloft. At that moment, their space station was soaring 240 miles above the North Atlantic. </p> <p>Powerful xenon lights illuminated the 3-mile-long runway as Atlantis emerged from the gloom like a ghost ship, with a half-moon as a backdrop. Touchdown was right on time, at 3:56am, just as the launch was back on September 8. </p> <p>It was only the 15th night-time landing in space shuttle history. Night-time landings are becoming more common, though, now that Nasa has a space station in orbit. All three previous shuttle flights to the space station also ended in darkness. </p> <p>The freshly stocked space station was soaring 240 miles above the Atlantic when Atlantis touched down. It will be visited by shuttle astronauts again in just two weeks; its first full-time residents will move in at the beginning of November. </p> <p>\"We had a great time,\" commander Terrence Wilcutt said after inspecting his ship. \"We're all glad to be back.\" </p> <p>Wilcutt and his crew spent eight days at the space station, five of them inside. By the time they left Sunday night, they had hauled in and tucked away 3 tons of equipment. Among the supplies: shampoo, cream, shaving gel, moist towels and napkins, Russian and American meals, ear plugs, medical kits, labels, printer parts, clamps, brackets, camera equipment and small bags for the first permanent crew to use to relieve themselves in case the toilet jams. </p> <p>The shuttle astronauts also installed the toilet, oxygen generator and treadmill in the new living quarters, and ran power and TV cables up the outside. </p> <p>Getting an extra day helped. Nasa stretched the mission to 12 days to give the astronauts and cosmonauts more time inside. The only disappointment was with one of five new batteries that were plugged into the Russian modules. It would not charge properly and was disconnected; the first residents will deal with the problem when they arrive. </p> <p>Another shuttle crew is scheduled to depart for the space station on October 5 aboard Discovery, making Nasa's 100th shuttle flight. Unlike this mission, most of the work will be outside next time. Four spacewalks are planned to wire up the first piece of station truss, or girder, and a new shuttle docking port, and to install tool boxes and power converters. </p> <p>Nasa plans to use spacesuit parts from this mission on Discovery's flight. Workers will remove the spacewalking suits from Atlantis so the emergency oxygen packs can be installed in Discovery's suits, Nasa engineer Phil West said. </p> <p>The regulators in all of Nasa's emergency oxygen packs were found in June to be contaminated with potentially flammable oil. The packs in the suits aboard Atlantis were cleaned. Nasa does not have enough time to scrub more packs, however, and therefore will use at least two of the ones that flew on Atlantis, West said. </p> <p>Discovery's mission will clear the way for the launch of space station commander Bill Shepherd and his two-cosmonaut crew aboard a Russian rocket on October 30. They will arrive at the orbiting complex two days later and stay four months. </p> <p>As for Atlantis, it will return to the space station in January, carrying the first lab module named Destiny. Space station assembly is expected to last until 2006.</p>",
  "<p>Ask any parent what he or she wants for their child and they will say something about \"being happy\" or \"fulfilling potential\". Ask what is necessary to achieve these goals and you'll probably hear words like \"self-confidence\" and \"self-esteem\". Neither term is as popular in Britain as in the US. Yet new research confirms what has repeatedly been found to be true: self-esteem is a key to successful development and has a far greater impact on future success (and happiness) than intelligence or talent. </p> <p>The research comes from Leon Feinstein's team at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, who have published results of studies on children born in April 1970 which showed a close correlation between childhood self-esteem and adult success. </p> <p>The crucial years seem to be between five and 15, when children learn to assess their abilities and form expectations of success or failure which continue to frame their adult self-image. Parents school them in the importance of coming out \"on top\", while simultaneously they may try to support self-esteem by \"talking them up\". But the combination of pressure to perform and indiscriminate praise may confuse children. </p> <p>It is often difficult to gauge confidence because self-esteem is not simply high or low. In childhood, it undergoes daily shifts in shape and intensity, varying with the familiarity of the setting, the task at hand, the attitudes of the people around. </p> <p>Until about 10, children's daily lives are chock-a-block with discoveries about their abilities, their powers and limitations. They feel confident in one situation, but not in another. They are in control when the school bell rings, but lose confidence when someone is late to pick them up at the school gate. Adults usually only suffer such swings at times of social upheaval. </p> <p>There is no sure method of assessing self-esteem, or measuring the extent to which it is lacking. In the abstract, a child may declare herself confident, say, in maths, but freeze when the teacher invites her to work on a new type of question. Some children boast of being the next David Beckham, yet they don't feel sufficiently confident to join in a game. Dreams aren't any use, unless they give day-to-day support. </p> <p>If asked directly whether they think they can do something, or whether they \"like themselves\", children may speak with a confidence that is not really felt: they learn quickly that they shouldn't be down on themselves. </p> <p>So how can parents judge a child's self-esteem? Some of the danger signals are obvious enough: a child who constantly makes derogatory comments about herself, expresses a wish to die, or speaks pessimistically about her future, is voicing despair over her own self-image. </p> <p>But there are less obvious danger signals too, and these often involve lack of energy or interest in the world. A child with high self-esteem is curious, eager to know, and confident of her ability to understand. One who gives away little personal information may just be reserved - but may feel she has nothing of interest to say. </p> <p>A child who cries frequently when faced with new or difficult tasks is likely to anticipate her own failure and be anxious about her own abilities. One who acts impulsively, or behaves inconsistently, may believe she has no control over the outcome of her actions. Nothing is more important in building self-esteem than a sense of being effective; nothing tears it down as much as a sense of powerlessness. </p> <p>Parents can help. First, they can listen, key into what the child says, and accept her own statements about how she feels and what she thinks. They can help her find (acceptable) ways of expressing her emotions, whether of joy or sadness. Acceptance of her own emotions, and awareness of her parents' genuine wish to understand are important foundations of self-esteem. </p> <p>Secondly, parents can ease anxiety about performance by showing the child that she does have power to extend her skills and knowledge. The important message is that one's abilities and behaviour can improve with effort. If a child does badly in an exam, what reasons does she give? Does she say, \"I'm stupid/ I'm no good at this?\" or does she say, \"I didn't prepare enough/ pace myself\"? The first replies show a belief in failure as permanent and inevitable. The second show that she sees some way of improving her performance. </p> <p>Parents should also be on the lookout for what she says when she does well. If she says, \"It was easy/ I was lucky\", then even experience of success does not build confidence because she does not link it to her own efforts. Children with high self-esteem do not necessarily experience fewer failures than those with low self-esteem, but unlike the latter, they see how they can improve. </p> <p>Third, parents can foster confidence by moderating their own anxiety about performance. The intense involvement parents often have with a child's \"success\" can lead to anger and frustration at \"failure\" to shine. Sometimes, too, a parent's own unhappiness or stress blocks interest in a child's complex inner world. Being ignored can make a child feel she has nothing to offer. </p> <p>While self-esteem can be bolstered in a number of ways - by friends, siblings, teachers, even pets - parents are usually the quickest to respond to need, and so are the first to receive the instructions of pundits. But parents don't have to have perfect control of their own lives to help their children maintain self-esteem. </p> <p>Even if their own self-esteem suffers in the ups and downs of adult life, they retain the capacity to support a child's, for self-esteem involves learning how to survive in the midst of problems. After all, we are aiming at skills that help children to thrive in an imperfect world. </p> <p>\u0095 Terri Apter's The Confident Child: Raising Children to Believe in Themselves, is published by Bantam in New York and available at any internet bookshop.</p>",
  "<p>The two main nursing journals could not have treated it more differently. Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), had been nominated for election as president of the International Council of Nurses and was the sole nominee, said a brief item in last week's Nursing Standard, the college's magazine. \"Hancock looks set to quit RCN,\" ran the headline in the independent Nursing Times. </p> <p>Hancock has been the college's general secretary for more than a decade and her departure would be no great surprise. But she, and the rest of the RCN's leadership, will not have welcomed the outbreak of speculation about her future at what is a critical juncture for the college itself and nursing as a whole. </p> <p>On the national stage, nursing has its tail up. As the medical profession's stock has sunk ever lower, so nursing has been seized on and promoted by ministers as the patient and voter-friendly alternative. But nurses are waiting for Labour to deliver - on staff numbers, pay and, most importantly, power - and Hancock knows the pressure has to be kept up. </p> <p>Within the RCN, meanwhile, decisions are about to be taken on key issues. Voting ends today in a three-way membership ballot on the college's presidency, with the incumbent Christine Watson facing challenges from Roswyn Hakesley-Brown and, for a second successive year, Ray Rowden, the high profile NHS commentator, who is promising to shake up \"the closed and elitist culture of the nursing hierarchy\". Next month, voting will close on two highly controversial issues. The college's 325,000 members are being asked to agree to a hefty 29% rise in subscriptions, and to make a change to the RCN constitution to allow some healthcare assistants into a special category of membership. </p> <p>This is by no means the first time that the leadership has sought to win acceptance of those who are not qualified nurses or students. And resistance continues to be fierce: at the college's annual congress earlier this year, the move to reopen the issue was passed by a majority of just 5%. But the rise of the healthcare assistant, increasingly taking over less skilled nursing tasks and increasingly holding vocational qualifications, makes the membership question an urgent one. </p> <p>If the leadership wins the vote, to be announced at the RCN's annual general meeting on October 18, it will be a considerable feather in Hancock's cap. And it will undoubtedly prove more significant for the college than another vote with which she is already inescapably associated: the decision, in 1995, to tear up its no-strike rule. </p> <p>\"Never the same again,\" said Nursing Times at the time. But it has, in fact, since been very much the same. The college has not taken any industrial action and there is no prospect of it doing so. Yet the scrapping of the no-strike rule was a stunning propaganda coup that had reverberations across the political landscape. </p> <p>Hancock's use of that issue was much in the mould of her predecessor, Trevor Clay, who transformed what was the original twin-set-and-pearls organisation into the very model of new trade unionism. She came from an NHS management background, though she had of course been a nurse, and had to reign in some of the college's wilder entrepreneurial activity that an ailing Clay had let flourish. </p> <p>The college has, however, always been highly centralised. And this is causing dissent over the running of the current ballots. Mike Hayward, a prominent RCN steward from Portsmouth, wrote in last week's Nursing Times that he had received nine \"biased and misleading\" pieces of propaganda on the membership and subscription votes, including a postcard that has gone from Hancock to each member. Describing this as a \"scandalous abuse of power\", Hayward called for a new general secretary who would \"run democratic, open and well-informed ballots\". </p> <p>If the speculation is right, he may be getting a new general secretary soon. The college is playing down talk of Hancock going, but the international role she will formally get next June is not seen as compatible with leading the RCN. No obvious successor stands waiting, but there would be no shortage of candidates for the \u00a390,000-plus a year job. </p> <p>Hancock has always been coy about her age, but one profile five years ago put her then at 52. Nurses of her generation have the right to retire with full benefits at 55. All things considered, the timing would seem to be right.</p>",
  "<p> Few people with any experience of health care would be surprised to hear that one of the last women to leave the peace camp at Greenham Common was a former midwife. Midwives have a long history as campaigners and radicals in the NHS, and in the wider political arena, and Sarah Hipperson embodies that tradition. </p> <p>Hipperson arrived at Greenham in 1983 \u0097 two years after the first group of women set up camp at the Berkshire base, demanding the removal of US cruise missiles from British soil. In the 60s, she had become more and more concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. She became an anti-nuclear activist and visited Greenham when the women\u0092s protest began. After the original group was served a high court order, requiring them to leave, she made her home in a tent at the perimeter fence. </p> <p> She was not the only midwife at Greenham and Hipperson wonders whether her career had anything to do with her decision to protest. \u0093We\u0092re all the sum total of our experience,\u0094 she says. \u0093My nursing and midwifery experience impacted strongly on me and I went on to have five children.</p> <p> \u0093Nuclear weapons were just not comparable with any laws of nature or God. I discovered that if a bomb exploded, all my knowledge would be completely useless. I would have expected in times of war that doctors, nurses and midwives would have a role to play, but if a nuclear weapon was dropped there would be absolutely nothing we could do to help anyone.</p> <p> \u0093I have asked myself why there were so many midwives at Greenham. The whole process of bringing life into the world was part of my life, not just as a midwife but as a woman, whereas nuclear weapons were about the destruction of life. And I think that\u0092s why I went to Greenham.\u0094</p> <p> Hipperson and two other women finally quit the base this month, 10 years after the last US missiles left and eight years after the common was made \u0093redundant for military purposes\u0094. The women achieved their aim \u0097 the 1,000-acre site is now being used for peaceful means and houses a business park and a nature reserve. The women at Greenham were strongly associated with feminism and many midwives believe their radicalism and their desire to change women\u0092s health services for the better are also rooted in this movement. </p> <p> Ella Jackson, a midwife from Brighton, is an activist in the Association of Radical Midwives (Arm), an organisation formed in 1976 by student midwives who shared a frustration with the increasing medicalisation in maternity care. She says: \u0093The Arm does have its roots in feminism. Midwifery is a vocation and we genuinely care about what we are doing. I don\u0092t think you can get into women\u0092s issues without being vocal and committed. Being a midwife is about empowering women to have the kind of labour they want, it\u0092s about giving birth back to women.\u0094</p> <p>In 1993, almost 20 years after the Arm was established, the Tory government launched Changing Childbirth \u0097 a document which promised a root-and-branch transformation in maternity services. The term \u0093woman-centred care\u0094 was born and for the first time a mother-to-be would get the same midwife throughout her pregnancy. Although some mothers and professionals would challenge whether this is the case now, midwives were instrumental in forcing a change \u0097 maternity services were to be run with the wishes of women at their centre. </p> <p>Mary Cronk, an independent midwife based in London, and one of the original radical midwives, says that while it was mothers themselves who were the prime movers in forcing change, midwives quickly joined in. \u0093Changing Childbirth was the consumers and midwives working together to effect change. They said they were no longer going to tolerate things like being shaved and given enemas before going into labour.\u0094 </p> <p>Midwives have always been autonomous practitioners \u0097 a woman can go through an entire pregnancy and labour without ever seeing a doctor if she wants to \u0097 and their title is protected in law. Midwives are also fiercely protective of their professional status and woe betide anyone who confuses them with nurses. One American midwifery website equates the term nurse/midwife with that of \u0093carpenter/ballerina\u0094. </p> <p>This pride in the distinctiveness of the profession may have something to do with the fact that they are referred to as \u0093madwives\u0094 by some doctors and nurses. Jackson says: \u0093When I was a student, \u0091madwife\u0092 was used by some people but people don\u0092t think of us like that anymore. I think we\u0092re accepted and respected. Radical midwives even have dealings with the government as we have been consulted on some policies, such as changes to the UKCC [the nurses\u0092, midwives\u0092 and health visitors\u0092 regulatory body] and primary care.\u0094</p> <p>But in these anti-radical days is there a future for politicised midwives? Gay Lee, a midwife from London and one of the original radicals, thinks it is time that the radicalism which spawned Changing Childbirth took hold again. \u0093Changing Childbirth changed people\u0092s philosophy and woman-centred care became an accepted notion. The problem is we need to establish a service where this can be practised. The midwife is on call, she is providing one-to-one care, so it means that she\u0092s having to do long hours in an overstretched and underfunded service. Midwives are voting with their feet. People are worried about this, but they\u0092re not organising anything collectively to oppose it. And it\u0092s time they did.\u0094 </p> <p>\u0095 Hipperson is leading an appeal for a memorial to the Greenham women. A cheque to the Commemorative Fund Appeal should be sent to GWPC, 15 Sydney Road, London E11 2JW. </p> <p> <strong>Health and safety </strong><br></p> <p>The Greenham protest may be over, but a Hull midwife and health visitor, Lindis Percy, is campaigning to put other US military bases under scrutiny.</p> <p>A member of a group called the Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases, Percy\u0092s main target is Menwith Hill, an American intelligence base in the Yorkshire Dales. The base has come under renewed scrutiny recently because of its reported role in the proposed US national missile defence system. </p> <p>Percy became involved in peace campaigning after attending a public meeting in Souhampton about military activities on Salisbury Plain. \u0093I came out of that meeting thinking what absolute madness and I became totally committed to raising questions and opposing deadly weapons,\u0094 she says. She has been arrested and even imprisoned many times, but has never been deterred from her mission. \u0093If being a health visitor is about preventing ill health, then this campaign against weapons of mass destruction goes hand in hand with that.\u0094</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft's fight against a judge's order to break up the company received a fillip yesterday after the US supreme court declined the government's request to hear the appeal - instead sending it to a lower court. </p> <p>The decision was seen as a victory for Microsoft, because the US court of appeals has ruled in the software maker's favour in past competition clashes with the government. </p> <p>\"I think the ruling is a positive,\" said Henry Asher, president of Northstar Group, a money management firm that includes Microsoft in its portfolio. </p> <p>\"Ultimately the more important question for the business model is the success of new-generation software, but the ruling is the first piece of really good news the company has had on the legal front for quite a while.\" </p> <p>In early Nasdaq trading the shares reached $64, up almost 6%. </p> <p>In June, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson gave the company four months to devise a detailed blueprint for splitting into two separate corporations after being found guilty of abusing its stranglehold over the personal computer industry. </p> <p>To prevent a protracted legal dispute which would leave a dark cloud hanging over the industry, the justice department took advantage of a little-used rule to seek immediate supreme court review of the case when Microsoft announced an appeal. </p> <p>But yesterday the supreme court agreed with Microsoft that its appeal should first be heard by a lower court. Of the nine high court members, only Justice Stephen Breyer dissented from that view. He said the case \"significantly affects an important sector of the economy\". </p> <p>Chief justice William Rehnquist declined to exclude himself from the Microsoft case, even though the company has hired a law firm in Boston for which his son works. </p> <p>Analyst Laura Ledermen, of William Blair &amp; Co, said the decision by the US supreme court was certainly a positive for the share price because it gave the company more time to prepare its defence. </p> <p>She also noted that the decision by the lower court, which ruled in Microsoft's favour in a related hearing in 1998, was more likely to be upheld by the supreme court. </p> <p>However, Larry Wachtel of Prudential Securities warned that, with the appeals process now likely to take one or two years and sales of Windows 2000 slowing, the future for Microsoft was still unclear. </p> <p>\"It's a very complex matter, and the supreme court wants it solidified in the appeals process. All that's happened is that instead of a decision immediately, we'll get it probably over a one- to two-year basis. There is still uncertainty where it goes,\" he said. </p> <p>Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, played down the importance of yesterday's ruling, calling it \"just another procedural step in the process\", although he said that the company was glad to have the opportunity to present its case to the lower court. </p> <p>Justice department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said: \"We look look forward to presenting our case to the court of appeals as expeditiously as possible.\" </p> <p>Under the terms of Judge Jackson's ruling, one of the two Microsoft companies would own and market the Windows operating system while the other would handle the other software, such as its Word programme and internet browsers.</p>",
  "When Basil Bernstein, who has died aged 75, was a residential family case worker at the Bernhard Baron Settlement, in Stepney, east London, he first noticed what he later described as \"the discontinuity between the staff and members of the community\", which became apparent in the way they communicated with each other. <p>This connection - between social groupings and ways of speaking - launched him on a course to becoming a figure of world significance in the field of socio-linguistics. The climax of his career was as Karl Mannheim professor of sociology in education, at London University, and five volumes of his work - four in his series Class, Codes And Control - have become required reading on sociology courses worldwide. </p> <p>The son of a Jewish immigrant family, Bernstein was brought up in London's East End. At the outbreak of the second world war, he volunteered under-age for the RAF, and served as a bombardier in Africa. After the war, he started work in Stepney, with the settlement's famous boys' clubs, run for local underprivileged Jewish children, aged between nine and 18. </p> <p>In 1947, Bernstein went to the London School of Economics to take a diploma in social sciences, but transferred to sociology after a month, with the encouragement of his tutor. With neither student grant nor family money to support him, he took a succession of menial jobs, including labouring and working as a shop assistant, sleeping on the couches of friends and studying when he could. He then trained as a teacher at Kingsway Day College. </p> <p>Between 1954 and 1960, he taught classes of post-office messenger boys and dockers at the City Day College, in Shoreditch. Although his subjects ranged from maths to physical education, often his liveliest and most rewarding classses involved studying motor mechanics and road safety, even though he himself could not drive - a fact he successfully hid from his pupils. </p> <p>In 1960, Bernstein became a research assistant in phonetics at University College, London, before taking a higher degree in linguistics and gaining his PhD. Two years later, he moved to the Institute of Education, where he remained for the rest of his career. Here he swiftly moved from senior lecturer to reader in the sociology of education and, in 1967, to a professorship and head of the sociological research unit. </p> <p>It was at the institute that Bernstein produced his most influential work, on the social impediments to learning and the role that communication plays in reinforcing class structure. In 1971, his Theoretical Studies Towards A Sociology Of Language was published. This was followed by Applied Studies Towards A Sociology Of Language (1973), Towards A Theory Of Educational Transmissions (1975) and The Structuring Of Pedagogic Discourse (1990). </p> <p>Bernstein also worked with Walter Landis on Selection And Control (1974), and with Landis and Dorothy Henderson on Social Class, Language And Communication. In 1996, he published the fifth of his volumes, Pedagogy, Symbolic Control And Identity, the revised and expanded edition of which was published earlier this year. </p> <p>Bernstein was awarded a number of honorary doctorates, including from univers-ities in Athens and Lund, Sweden. His work has had a huge effect on reforming educational practice abroad, particularly in Chile and Mexico, where former students have become influencial civil servants. Earlier this year, a conference in his honour was held in Lisbon. Too ill to attend, he joined the debate via a special video link-up. </p> <p>Bernstein enjoyed music and art, but most of all, and appropriately, conversation. He leaves his wife Marion, whom he married in 1955, and two sons, Saul and Francis. </p> <p><b>Professor Mary Douglas writes:</b> I first met Basil Bernstein in 1965, just after I had handed in to the publisher the typescript of Purity And Danger. His short article, A socio-linguistic approach to social learning, in the Penguin Survey Of The Social Sciences, had had an electrifying effect on me; I did not understand it, but I still get the sense of excitement when I read his whole future programme in its pages. </p> <p>Here was a thinker who was struggling with the deepest problems of culture, but applying his method to us in modern industrial society. In the expansive days of the 1950s, established academic subjects were turning out to have a social dimension that had been overlooked: socio- linguistics was fairly new, and the learned disciplines treated the newly added social element as a decorative appendage to the main job. </p> <p>Bernstein himself had a caustic wit and could be very funny about the marginalising of so-called inter-disciplinary studies. The \"socio-\" part of linguistics, psychology and other disciplines was mainly taken as given, which meant taken from textbooks (or newspapers), anecdotal, not systematised. There was no sense that sociology itself would need to be re-thought. </p> <p>Bernstein's central idea was that language is mediated by social relations. \"Humans speak,\" he declared, \"but sociology is silent about that fact.\" At that time, the link between humans and speech acts was taken to lie within the individual psyche. To propose the social structure as the governing factor was revolutionary. For me at least, it was a shock to learn that the words I utter, and the sentiments I express, are called forth from me by the expectations of the people I live with. </p> <p>The contrast he drew was between \"elaborated speech codes\" of the contemporary middle classes strenuously seeking upward mobility, and \" restricted speech codes\" of working classes, stuck where they are. On his theory, everyone's speech responds to strong cultural pressures, not least those who most pride themselves as autonomous individuals. </p> <p>His examples of how the middle-class mother speaks to her child are hilariously funny. Her elaborated speech code, and the kind of family life she wants to establish, respond nakedly to pressures for social advancement. In the other type of family - positional families using the restricted code - members have to behave according to their position, older, younger, male or female. The system flourished where social mobility was blocked; speech was used for creating communalised symbolic resources, strengthening community solidarity. </p> <p>Bernstein used examples from the English working classes, the aristocracy, or mil itary families. It was a theory of speech forms responding to two types of social control, one through positioning and one through individualising. </p> <p>The theory fitted Bernstein's own class resentment, which did not help to make it popular. The real stumbling block for the linguists was his favourite word, \" code\". They could talk about language as a code, but not about \"speech codes\". Paradoxically, the critics in socio-linguistics suspected him of bias against the underprivileged, a bizarre perversion of his attitude. Bernstein admired the \" restricted code\", as he called it, for its power, directness, wit, and vivid, dramatic effects. Alas, his own writing is not like this, dense with technical terms, very elaborated. He was also suspected of determinism, cultural or linguistic: a complete misunderstanding. </p> <p>He certainly enjoyed recognition in his lifetime, but the power and originality of his thinking should have made a much bigger impact. He was firing the first shots in a revolution in the social sciences. That the revolution has still not arrived was no one's fault directly. He was a brilliant mind, his influence went very deep. </p> <p> Basil Bernard Bernstein, sociologist, born November 1 1924; died September 24 2000</p>",
  "<p>Ah! Jeeves, where's my new-look Daily Telegraph ? </p> <p>There on the breakfast table for you as usual, sir. Just behind the banana and apricot muesli. </p> <p>But I say, Jeeves, what's new about this? The jolly old sheet looks almost exactly the same. </p> <p>Yes and no, sir. In these times of flux and expansion, if I may quote its editor, 'clarity and elegance' become ever more important. We are all searching for a 'cleaner, more open' appearance, with our sections 'better delineated', while simultaneously seeking to make our Comment pages 'sparer and stronger'. The aim, I believe, is to render a well-loved organ more 'attractive and modern in feel while emphasising its broadsheet authority and respecting its well-loved landmarks'. </p> <p>So it's all change, Jeeves, except you're not supposed to notice it? </p> <p>Precisely, sir. Evolution not revolution. </p> <p>Jeeves, is Boris Johnson a well-loved landmark? </p> <p>And that, of course, has been the Telegraph way since Conrad Black first took control. Softly softly no losey monkey. There have been few shrewder holding actions in modern newspaper history. Ten years ago (in August, 1990) the Telegraph sold 1,080,139 copies. Last month, after a vivid decade of price warfare and challenge to its spot on top of the broadsheet heap, it still sold 1,025,027. </p> <p>The dip below the advertisers' magic million, mooted for years, hasn't happened. The pursuing pack, led by the Times , has made up no ground of late. That's a natural cue for modest refurbishment - a tidying here, a touch of paint there. The Telegraph is in no sense broke. It apparently requires only the most modest degree of fixing. </p> <p>What would Bertie Wooster note if he put his monocle in and concentrated hard? Cut-out heads of contributors and interviewees above rather than below the masthead on the front. (When I did that on the Guardian long ago it was reckoned a wild gamble in the trade; now it's conventional tinkering). A contents listing on page 2 which comes straight out of last year's Guardian revamp. A splatter of fashionably grey page titles (like the Guardian ) and sans-serif labels (like the Times ). More white space on the leader spread (like the Guardian ). More sport and family finance (like everybody else). </p> <p>There's not a single original notion on view, just a magpie catch-up. Does that matter? It never has before; there is no immediate reason why it should now. Telegraph readers like their superior high-street feel, more Austin Reed than instant boutique. This is the winter season's stock arriving. </p> <p>But the real question, perhaps, is how these surface adjustments relate to the bigger decisions down below. Just because sales in the past 10 years seem barely affected does not mean there hasn't been a lot going on. Consider the Saturday circulation explosion, which has pushed the broadsheet dailies up to a weekend sale that rivals the Sunday papers - but has also disguised a falling-away in regular purchase through the week. Consider the lingering impact of the price wars. </p> <p>Research is beginning to show a plateau on Saturdays, followed by a stalling of circulation growth across the broadsheet board. Can this Telegraph, adding more sections on Saturday, buck that developing trend? Can its rivals, thinking similarly, steal a march? Whoever wins at the weekend will have scored a significant victory, delaying the moment when Monday-to-Friday performance comes under the microscope. </p> <p>Weekday ways, however, already present a keen contrast in strategy. How many sections equal success? The morning the 'new' Telegraph launched, it had only two sections as usual (sport and the rest); the Guardian had five. </p> <p>In essence, the daily broadsheets have two contrasting philosophies for through-the-week sales. The Times, Guardian and (modestly) the Independent theme their days, feature sections and advertising, making a series of different pitches to different audiences. The Telegraph plugs along more steadily, using its own cut-price speciality (subscription sales) as underpinning - because subscriptions, of course, reinforce daily purchase. </p> <p>Don't underestimate the hidden value of that prop. Without it (and without other gambits such as bulk copies) the Telegraph's ABC sale in the home market last month would have been only 641,491 (not so far ahead of the Times ' s 580,855). Almost 300,000 readers come via the costly subscription route. Will Conrad Black, battling on many fronts around the globe, be able to keep that up indefinitely? He will need to, because subscriptions have helped make the Telegraph something of an island unto itself (taken as a solus paper by 80 per cent of its readers against, say, 59 per cent of Independent purchasers). </p> <p>If the through-the-week strategy weakens, in short, comparisons will start being made rather more regularly. That may be to the Telegraph's benefit. It's perfectly possible that busy readers leading busy lives through the week don't want piles of sections, that the newsprint mountains of Saturday are more their style. But, equally, the Telegraph would be more open to specific attack, its current skimpings more exposed to examination. </p> <p>Foreign news, for instance, barely troubled the scorer on revamp morning. Such competition matters to the Telegraph in the medium term because holding firm isn't enough if 47 per cent of your readers are aged over 55 (and nearly 30 per cent will never see 65 again). You need young converts coming in, and the figures for those (between 15 and 34) have slipped a bit over the past 12 months. </p> <p>I say, Jeeves, better keep beavering on the delineation front, what?</p>",
  "<p>The government's NHS plan has promised us thousands more health professionals, not only to overcome staff shortages faced in many areas but also to expand provision through extra hospital and intermediate care beds, GP surgeries and nurse-led, walk-in centres. </p> <p>All of this is excellent news. But there is one small problem. All the extra money and all the promises on paper will make no difference unless thousands of willing people decide to work for the NHS. </p> <p>Skilled people are the single most important resource for any health service. At present, they are also the most scarce - and the prospects of keeping them are not good. Growing proportions of nurses and inner-city GPs are nearing retirement age. Many more health workers are moving into the private sector, or to job opportunities outside the health system, and are not being replaced by sufficient new recruits. </p> <p>A recent King's Fund report, The Last Straw, found that NHS nurses were unhappy about poor pay, bleak conditions and chronic shortages of basic resources that they experience on a daily basis. They were frustrated by inflexible working arrangements, limited career development opportunities and lack of control over their working environment. Racist harassment and discrimination were also strongly in evidence. The implications of these findings for the recruitment and retention of health workers are considerable. </p> <p>There is a wider issue here, too, which should be of concern to anyone who works for, or with, the public sector. The concept of public service, which in recent history has been a source of pride and commitment, has gradually fallen into disrepute. Ambitious young people, leaving schools and universities, no longer see public service as the height of personal achievement. Instead, it is associated with ponderous bureaucracy, political manipulation, poor opportunities and low pay. </p> <p>If the government wants to succeed with its NHS plan, it must make public service seem worthwhile to a wider group of people. Ministers must show they value public sector workers, not just by saying so, but by demonstrating their commitment in practice. They must provide bigger pay packets, better (and broader) career opportunities, more flexible working arrangements and much more of a chance for workers at all levels to influence how services are run. </p> <p>The concept of public service, wrapped up in the values of another century, looks dated. The challenge for ministers is to build a new vision of public service that harnesses the values of equity and altruism, as well as chiming with the personal goals of the kinds of people the state needs to get to work for it - and for all of us.</p> <p>\u0095 Rabbi Julia Neuberger is chief executive of the King's Fund health policy institute.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday when we gathered to march through the centre of Prague, there were only a few police on the streets. Today, there are clusters of armed officers at every corner. People are being randomly stopped, searched and asked for ID. If they are unable to show a valid passport or visa they are arrested. The protest information centre is now being monitored by uniformed police officers. Protestors were arrested at a World Bank/IMF delegate hotel this morning.</p> <p>This morning, as a small number of us gathered at a main square to discuss our plans for the day, two hundred riot police arrived in armoured vans. They had pepper spray, huge batons and shields. They piled out, and into the crowd, surrounding people sitting on the church steps. We were released only if we could show valid ID. Five people were arrested as protestors chanted \"Let them go. Free political prisoners!.\" </p> <p>Yesterday we had freedom of movement around Prague. Today, it seems, police will crack down on any large assembly.</p> <p>It is because of yesterday's violence.</p> <p>It began yesterday afternoon, as my group were locked into a peaceful standoff with police and tanks at the main bridge to the conference centre. We heard reports of violent flare-ups at other railway bridges to the conference centre. The \"Blue Group\" had decided to take the police head on. Mainly German anarchists, the group came armed with Molatov Cocktails, bricks and sticks. We heard that ten managed to reach the conference centre, but most were beaten back by riot police with CS gas and water canons. We read in the Czech papers this morning that many police were injured, many protesters are in hospital. In the square this morning, some protesters were wearing head bandages.</p> <p>There was a statement today from INPEG, the Czech hosts of the protest: \"If you threw a rock, firebomb, apple, bottle or anything else at a cop during yesterdays protest and you are NOT an employee of some bullshit law enforcement agency, then shame on you. You have betrayed INPEG's commitment to non-violence, the movement and yourselves.\"</p> <p>As I write, protestors are gathering again in the main square. They are huddled into groups, discussing what to do now. Options include going to the hotels, trying to get to the conference centre, maintaining a protest at the square and waiting for the Opera tonight, where delegates will be entertained.</p> <p>One thing is certain. Because of the Blue Group's violence, any moves we make will be quickly curtailed by riot police. Smaller groups are likely to be challenged by police at every corner. Our non-violent, legitimate protests have been aborted, not by police or authorities, but by the people we call Comrades.</p>",
  "These are edited extracts from Tony Blair's speech in Brighton yesterday: <p>No prime minister, no party leader, could have a better deputy than John Prescott. </p> <p>You know why the Tories hate him: because he started out as a seaman, steward on a ship, rose to be deputy prime minister and has never hidden or been anything other than totally proud of where he came from. </p> <p>And you know why I like him: because not once in the last two weeks has he reminded me that when he was in charge in August we were 20 points ahead in the polls. </p> <p>For me, the large majority we won was never a reason to do the job quickly; but to do it properly. We knew: first base was getting the fundamentals in place. </p> <p>We said we would sort the economy out. We have. The strongest British economy for decades, delivered by this New Labour government. </p> <p>We said we'd get people off benefit and into work. We are. One million more jobs. </p> <p>We said we'd invest in schools and hospitals. It is happening. </p> <p>And because we chose to invest; because we have in this country tens of thousands of dedicated hard working teachers as determined as we are to give every child a chance to succeed, last week, Britain had the best primary school results it has ever seen. </p> <p>I could go on and on. Because we should be proud of our record. But this is not a time for lists. But for setting out the big choices facing Britain and for dialogue. </p> <p><b> Knock</b><br> </p> <p> I'm the prime minister that's supposed to be the great reader of public opinion. After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch and I take responsibility. So: what do we make of it? </p> <p>Three years ago, Britain was desperate to get the Tories out. The people liked the look of us. We were a breath of fresh air. New faces, new ideas, new policies. In some areas we've exceeded expectations. Let us be honest, a few people doubted the economy would be stronger under Labour. But it is. They like the 1m new jobs. They believe we are trying to make progress on schools and hospitals. </p> <p>But for many families life's still a struggle. It's tough, balancing work and family. Jobs can be insecure. There's the mortgage to pay; the holiday to save for. Inflation may be lower but the kid's trainers don't get any cheaper. </p> <p>Then, people hear the 20 second clip on the news. They see the ding-dong at prime minister's questions. They try to make sense of the swirling mass of news and comment in the 24 hour media age. </p> <p>And they think: you're not listening. What's it got to do with me? Where is this journey's end? And a fog descends on the very dialogue between government and people necessary to get there. </p> <p>And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it. </p> <p>The dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions. </p> <p>75p. I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message. </p> <p>But I believe that when people reflect, on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing, and we are on the right track for Britain; and the last thing this country needs is a return to Tory government. </p> <p>Let me come direct to the fuel crisis. I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship. </p> <p>But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS. Over extra investment in schools. Over more police on the beat. Over public transport. </p> <p>I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept. </p> <p>I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country's prosperity. </p> <p>Our first priority was to help the 2m pensioners, many of them elderly women, who depend on income support. I make no apology for helping the poorest first and neither should this party. Through the winter allowance, now \u00a3150, and free TV licences for over 75s, we helped people with their most pressing costs. </p> <p>We rejected returning to the earnings link. For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them. </p> <p>But I know there are pensioners not on benefit, who have saved all their lives but are not by any stretch of the imagination wealthy, and for whom the basic state pension and other government help is essential. It is right they share in the nation's wealth. </p> <p><b> Listening</b><br> </p> <p> I am listening. I hear. And I will act. The point I'm making is this. The real world is full of competing causes. Most of them good. Most of them deserving. Many of them heart-rending. And it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities. It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose. </p> <p>The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes. It's how you explain why you're saying no. </p> <p>And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest; whose voice isn't supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them? </p> <p>So I am listening. But I was also elected to lead. And if we want to reach our journey's end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made. </p> <p>Today the Tories are back with exactly the plan of 10 years ago. You don't need me to predict it. We all experienced it. </p> <p>Don't ever let them con us into boom and bust again. Never forget: in 18 Tory years, unemployment trebled. Families of three generations with nobody bringing in a wage. Record youth unemployment. And what did they say: it was a price worth paying. Unemployment is never a price worth paying. </p> <p>The New Deal has helped nearly a million people with work or training, the largest ever jobs programme Britain has seen. </p> <p>The Working Families' Tax Credit makes work pay for over a million families. Childcare and training has helped 150,000 women find work or get a better job. And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 11/2 million people the dignity of a decent living wage. </p> <p>And we have introduced the democratic right, delivered after 100 years of trying, to be represented by a trade union should you want it. </p> <p>That was our choice. Not to leave you at the mercy of markets. Not to walk by. Not to say: tough, sink or swim. </p> <p>There's Mr Hague. Standing around waiting for a bandwagon. Then three come along at once. </p> <p>Opportunism always knocks for William Hague. You want tax cuts? Have them. Spending rises? Have them too. It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints. </p> <p>John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal. After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister. </p> <p>Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over 10 years any government has produced since the war. </p> <p>In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this parliament. A promise made. A promise kept. Today I make a further commitment. Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next parliament. </p> <p>Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term. </p> <p>The waiting list pledge has been met. There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS. Every A&amp;E that needs it is being modernised. The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way. But we all know. Eighteen years of neglect isn't put right in three years. </p> <p>Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer. There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer. </p> <p>Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third. 295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer. By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research. </p> <p>Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting. </p> <p>And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004. </p> <p>By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. Four out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related. </p> <p>It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. </p> <p>Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single moth ers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. </p> <p>Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. </p> <p>These are our second term plans. A 10 year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education. A cradle to grave poverty strategy. A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport. The next steps to full employment. </p> <p>This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform. The next steps on our journey. All based on our enduring mission, to offer everyone, not just the privileged few, the chance to succeed. </p> <p><b> Unifier</b><br> </p> <p> By nature I am a unifier. I am a builder of consensus. I don't believe in sloppy compromise. But I do believe in bringing people together. </p> <p>There is no point in leading the Labour party or leading a country without having a mission and a purpose that's more important to you than anything else. </p> <p>I will do whatever I can to bring people onside but there are certain things I cannot do. </p> <p>If you ask me to put tax cuts before education spending, I can't do it. </p> <p>If you ask me to take risks with stability in this country after all we've learned over the last 30, 40, 50 years - I can't do it. Many of you would agree with that, many of the British people would, but let me tell you some more difficult things I cannot do. </p> <p>If, in order to get a vote, I have to go out and tell people that Europe is full of terrible foreigners, we want nothing to do with them, and we'll stick two fingers up to them, I cannot do that either because in my heart I know it is wrong. </p> <p>I know asylum is a problem. We are trying to deal with it, but if people want me to go out and exploit the asylum issue for reasons of race which we all know about, then vote for the other man, because I will not do it. </p> <p>If I am asked to take that overseas aid budget that helps millions of people who live in circumstances of poverty we cannot even contemplate, and I am asked as the Conservatives do, to cut that budget for tax cuts, I cannot do it. </p> <p>I was not brought in by ideology or policy. I was brought in by that simple and old principle of solidarity, shoulder to shoulder we get more out of this life, and give more in this life, than we do fighting each other as isolated individuals. </p> <p>We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish. </p> <p>We do not lie down in the testing times. We hold firm. We listen and we lead. </p> <p>We can be confident in our policies, confident in the record we will put before the British people. Confident that we will repay the trust the British people put in us. Confident that we share their basic decent instincts and values. Confident that we are winning the big arguments on the big issues. </p> <p>Stability. Or boom and bust. Jobs. Or unemployment. Investment in schools and hospitals. Or cuts. Leadership and engagement in the world. Or weakness and sour isolation. </p> <p>Our journey's end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world. </p> <p>That journey, that better Britain of hope and opportunity for all, that better Britain that calls to our best instincts and transforms our nation, I tell you, that journey is a journey worth making.</p>",
  "Since Tony Blair became the Labour leader, he never had to argue with the country. He soothed it, smiled at it, won it. His opponents were so feeble, so divided, so exhausted, so abominated, that he wasn't in a serious fight. <p>So he was never forced to make his case. He was sel dom put to a difficult question. All he needed was to avoid frightening the horses, which he did successfully from 1994-97 and then for his first two years in power. </p> <p>The merit of recent events is that they have changed all that. Yesterday, for the first time as prime minister, Mr Blair addressed the country with arguments it might not like to hear. He took on the enemies of his project because, for the first time, he had to. It brought out by far the best in him. He emerged for the first time not primarily as a likeable leader, fawning and blurring and charming. There was very little smiling. Here instead was a combative, abrasive, adversarial man only now beginning to deploy on the country the argumentative passions that modernised the Labour party. </p> <p>Going for likeable always was an error. And it did not succeed. The country never did much like the first Mr Blair. When he got into trouble with the petrol blockade, the well of popular affection was found to be as dry as every Esso station. But likeable is not what proper leaders do, as he now seems to have acknowledged. Not before time, the trouble exposed by the opinion polls has summoned the Blairite style into a new and better era. </p> <p>That is not to say the leader has abandoned the spirit of consensus. He knows a concession when he sees it needs to be made. His virtual admission that the Greenwich dome really was a failure makes it easier, despite the shocking scale of the wasted money, to move on. Much more seriously, the new promises to pensioners, in which prime minister and chancellor have finessed their differences, look like being a big advance - quite essential for the most basic reasons of justice and politics alike. \"We get the message,\" he said, rueful contrition written on his face. </p> <p>But otherwise, the speech was as unappeasing as it was uningratiating. It was addressed to a country whose apparent disbelief in him Mr Blair himself cannot believe has any basis in reason or argument. Rather than the party proving itself to the country, one had the sense it was time the country proved itself to the Labour party. </p> <p>Notably unappeased, first, was the business world. For six conferences, Mr Blair has devoted at least a page of his speech to the reassurance of capitalism. Labour as the friend of business was a message he sent equally to the party and the City. In the seventh year, he implied, the mission has been accomplished. Barely a paragraph was directed to that quarter. </p> <p>Instead, it was up to business, and the whole wide world outside New Labour, to understand that this was now the party of government, the party with a project it had only begun. The vibes could not be more different from the nervy hysteria conveyed in those April memos exchanged with the polling adviser Philip Gould. Whether this accurately conveys a solid new confidence inside the skulls of the inner cabal I rather doubt. But the choice has been made, correctly, to show Labour as the party of the famous, unruffled, undeviating long term. </p> <p>Unappeased, too, were blockaders of every kind. Here Mr Blair finally acquired a proper gravitas towards the trouble at the pumps, bringing the country to its senses against people who think their own distress has the right to be expressed by throttling everyone else. He may have touched some easy populist law and order buttons, encouraging the police to break the rules if that is what it took to deal with drug crime. He never has been much of a civil libertarian. But he offered an argu ment and not a peace offering to the haulier heroes of the Daily Mail. </p> <p>He did not concede either, it must be said, to another class of critic, those who accuse him of Napoleonism. Though he no longer seems obsessed with being liked, he has lost none of his appetite for personal power and responsibility. </p> <p>There were mentions of selected colleagues, each with his own graded ranking. Gordon Brown was \"inspired\", David Blunkett was a great education secretary, John Prescott, with whom Mr Blair's personal axis may now be the most telling in the cabinet, the finest deputy a leader could have. Alan Milburn and Jack Straw were mentioned in dispatches. But mostly it was I. \"I am listening. I hear. I will act _ I was elected to lead _ I have my irreducible core.\" Mr Blair remains unashamed as the quasi-presidential figure who once told me, when I asked him if Labour would win the 1997 election, that it certainly would - if only he alone, his uninterrupted voice, was what the electorate heard speaking for the party. </p> <p>This tendency may be regrettable, and is certainly registering a new transitional phase in the history of cabinet government. It has got the leader into trouble, as a control-freak centraliser. One response to that might have been to deflect power and collectivise the project. He is probably incapable of doing that, and thereby still runs a considerable risk. Everything will rise or fall on his performance just about alone. He is meeting this chosen fate, on the other hand, by reverting to the quality that first put him where he is today, which is his appetite for the most direct and unflinching contest about ideas: his ideas, as against those of the Tory party. </p> <p>The thing he got rid of yesterday was the pretence that there can any longer be the search for common ground. Under pressure, New Labour is forced to become a party of argument and battle over a choice about which almost all its members, in the end, have no doubt. The leader is not only the greatest non-doubter, he is also the most complete exponent of a philosophy which he, more than any other person, has raised to the level of religious conviction. Prosperity and social justice. Realism and idealism. Self-interest and common good. Circles and squares. </p> <p>He really cannot see there is any flaw. All he suddenly sees is the terrible possibility that the second term, which is the first time the large rewards will become apparent, might elude him. So he has decided to make the choice on offer much more stark. This is conviction not contrivance. The speech was the least contrived I have heard him give. At the end, everyone saw his torso dripping with sweat. I thought I could see near-tears of fury at the faint chance of the country not agreeing with him. </p> <p>So the battle is joined. The election campaign, on one side, is beginning. Mr Blair lays down a challenge to the Tories. Can they equal his organised conviction? Will they give him an argument? Or do they plan to continue wallowing in the single-issue mud they have been successful in slinging for the past six months? It is a good thing they did it. It gave Mr Blair a necessary fright. But he has set a high standard for the combat to come: one which there is absolutely no sign that William Hague, in his new eminence, is ready to match.</p>",
  "Few Brits, I imagine, find the Labour conference shocking. Foreigners watching it do. Reality actually intrudes on politics. In America, political conventions happen only once every four years, and the proceedings are sealed tight in spin- doctor plastic. The demise of clause four would have been negotiated over drinks at a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser; in any event, American candidates do not run on party platforms, they run on kisses and smiles. <p>Particularly shocking to me at the run-up to this year's Labour event is the politicians' admissions of failure. The prime minister apologises, sort of, for the Millennium Dome disaster; the transport heavies defend themselves with evident self-doubt against Will Hutton's stinging indictment of the tube privatisation. In America a politician might admit to drinking or whoring, but will never apologise for acts committed in office. </p> <p>Self-flagellation, so strangely appealing in Britain, may explain the difference. Administering oneself doses of truth may be no more than a tactic to arouse the pleasures of pain. Still, this perverse habit may do you a political disservice. </p> <p>In a fleeting moment of the televised conference, some unnamed officials attached to the foreign secretary's office spoke ruefully about the demise of \"ethical foreign policy\" as though this, too, was a dome-like error. It was anything but one. </p> <p>Pursuing an ethical foreign policy, of course, runs up against the fact that Britain is one of the world's leading arms manufacturers. The ethics of bombing Kosovo are a matter of debate. Still, if a powerful country does not worry about its own morals, no one elsewhere can do the job for it. Cynicism breeds apathy - nothing good can be done; perhaps worse, cynicism serves as a way of avoiding the truth about the consequences of one's own actions. </p> <p> These thoughts came to home to me as I watched the Foreign Office people back-track on Robin Cook's ethical impulse, because I am about to embark on a trip back to Austria. The country is not my home but, like many Jews, I had relatives who were murdered there during the second world war. </p> <p>Austria has a truly cynical political culture. To my generation it put forward the transparent fiction that Austria, like Holland, was a victim of Nazi invasion; no one believed this of course, and that was in a way the point. You could say anything so long as you could get away with it. The more impudent the lie, the greater chance of success. </p> <p>This habit has come back to haunt the country. I don't mean that Haider's minions are neo-Nazis; that's too simple. But they reacted with rage to the notion of being judged, ethically, by the outside world, and Britain was a consequent judge, perhaps the most consequent of their judges. </p> <p>American foreign policy is awash in ethics-talk, but our actions as the world's imperial power tend to dispel the bite of our words. As cynics, the Austrian right took our proper measure. Britain, however, was truly a country menaced by the Nazis, and so its words carried more weight. Last year, my maid in a Viennese hotel, after a tirade against foreigners, interrupted herself to say: \"But that Sir Cook, he is a real gentleman.\" </p> <p>You may well grind your teeth, but her description of President Clinton, delivered in rich Viennese patois, is not fit for printing in a family newspaper. </p> <p>Britons tend to be blind, I think, to their prestige in Europe. It is a compound of many elements: snobbish fantasy, like that of my maid; surviving memories of the last world war; the desire to fence off America within the English-speaking world. But this prestige has also to do with Britain in itself, now. </p> <p>Germans and Italians contemptuous of their own third ways take that shining path seriously in Britain. It seems to them a vigorous policy, rather than trimming. The control-freakery of which Tony Blair is accused at home seems resoluteness abroad; the German centre-left contrasts him with their own chancellor's endless vacillation. \"Sir\" Cook's ethical foreign policy fits into the same picture. Any French politician who repeated it word for word would be hooted out of Paris; coming from him, these words receive respectful analysis in Le Monde. And in Austria, about to end its year of ethical purdah in the European Union, those words have had a chastening effect. </p> <p>Rather than fear Europe, Britain ought to welcome full integration; you will pull more than your economic weight. </p> <p>This is why I was a little saddened to hear the diplomats speak about ethical foreign policy in the voice of dome-doom. It may bring a perverse pleasure, but it is not the voice of reality. </p> <p> \u0095 Richard Sennett teaches sociology at the London School of Economics. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "President Slobodan Milosevic's government officially announced last night that there would be a second round contest in the battle for the Yugoslav presidency - even though all polls indicated that he has been defeated and does not qualify for a second attempt to win power. <p>In a brief press conference, the federal electoral commission, which is packed with political appointees of the president, announced that the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica won 48.22% of the vote in Sunday's ballot to 40.23 for Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>\"In short, in the presidential elections there will be a second round,\" an official told Serbian television. The second round run-off is scheduled for Sunday, October 8. </p> <p>But Mr Kostunica last night said he would not take part in the run-off, insisting he won the election outright. </p> <p>\"We are talking about political fraud and blatant stealing of votes,\" Mr Kostunica said in a statement. \"This is an offer which must be rejected.\" </p> <p>The commission's announcement confirmed the worst fears of the 19 opposition parties who are united behind Mr Kostunica, a 56-year-old law professor. According to almost all the polls, he won the presidential race by around 20 percentage points. </p> <p>The opposition called an immediate press conference to condemn the latest move by Mr Milosevic to hold on to power. There is growing concern that in the 12 days before the second round Mr Milosevic will use a reserve force of paramilitary police to suppress the growing numbers of demonstrators coming on to the streets. </p> <p>The danger is that, with the opposition's announcement that they will not contest the run-off, Mr Milosevic will claim victory by default. </p> <p>Reacting to the commission's announcement, opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said: \"We are dealing with a big fraud and falsifying of results. We were aware of their intentions because it was obvious they were cooking up something to get Mr Milosevic in the second round at least. But we have firm evidence in our hands and we will defend the will of the people till the end.\" </p> <p>Earlier Mr Djindjic had said: \"Kostunica won in the first round and the elections are over for us. There will be no second round.\" </p> <p>The Democratic Opposition of Serbia earlier released its own tally based on what it said was 97.5% of the ballots. It showed Mr Kostunica leading with 55% to Mr Milosevic's 35%. The figures are said to be based on reports by the opposition's poll watchers who monitor the local counts. </p> <p>Dagor Hiber, an opposition spokesman and vice president of the Civic Alliance, said it was unlikely Mr Kostunica would accept a second ballot: \"We will look at all these results and decide, but I think that our decision will be that there will not be a second round. \"We have all the electoral materials from 97% of voting places. I think the government are buying time,\" he said. </p> <p>Dragisa Burzan, a deputy prime minister in Montenegro, the small republic that along with Serbia forms Yugoslavia, said: \"Milosevic is consistent in claiming victory and it might mean he's not just going to walk away.\" </p> <p>During the day, the United States pledged to lead an international campaign to pressure Mr Milosevic into accepting the outcome. Washington joined European powers in calling for Mr Milosevic to accept an apparent opposition victory and step down from the power after 13 years. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton said that it was clear the opposition party had defeated Mr Milosevic and that if the will of the Serbian people was respected, the US would lift economic sanctions against the nation. </p> <p>\"Despite the government's attempts to manipulate the vote, it does seem clear that the people have voted for change,\" Mr Clinton said. \"The question is will the government listen in response?\" </p> <p>In Brighton, Tony Blair told the Labour party conference that it was time for Mr Milosevic to leave. \"I say to Milosevic: 'You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough'.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anti-globalisation protesters hurling Molotov cocktails and cobblestones prised from Prague's historic streets fought Czech police armed with tear gas and water cannon yesterday as they sought in vain to halt the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>In a series of violent clashes, the police, backed up by army detachments, squared up to activists who were laying siege to Prague's heavily guarded congress centre yesterday. </p> <p>Five hours of angry confrontations resulted in injuries to at least 60 people and left delegates trapped inside the building by the security cordon set up to prevent a repeat of the chaos that marked the World Trade Organisation talks in Seattle last December. </p> <p>However, they failed to prevent the gathering of the world's financial elite. </p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, managed to leave the centre, but David Clementi, the deputy-governor of the Bank of England, was held up in Prague by the vast security operation mounted by the Czech authorities. </p> <p>Speaking as teargas canisters exploded in the background, Mr Brown rejected protesters' call for the Bank and the IMF to be abolished. </p> <p>\"We can neither return to the protectionism of the 1930s nor some free market dogma,\" he said. \"We need to strengthen and modernise our global institutions.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's demonstrations, which attracted only a quarter of the expected 20,000 protesters, got off to a slow start. </p> <p>Security forces ringed the conference centre and the only road across the valley leading from there to the middle of Prague was blocked by more than 30 vanloads of police and personnel carriers containing soldiers. Helicopters hovered overhead and balaclava-clad marksmen patrolled the roof of the centre. </p> <p>In the opening clashes, several police officers were set alight when a Molotov cocktail exploded among them. They were saved from serious injury when colleagues doused the flames with a water cannon. </p> <p>At one stage, a small group of protesters broke through police barricades set up in a ravine on one side of the congress centre and tried to storm the hotel where many of the financiers and central bankers attending the conference were holed up. The breakaway group made it to within 100 yards of the centre before being repulsed by water cannons and volleys of tear gas. </p> <p>One British witness, trapped inside the five-star Corinthia Towers hotel, said: \"There is a hail of missiles being thrown at the building.\" </p> <p>Financiers and journalists were pelted with stones until police pushed the protesters back using dogs and batons. </p> <p>There were reports that 69 people had been injured, two thirds of them police officers. One Japanese and one Russian delegate were also injured. Most of the injuries were from projectiles. </p> <p>As dusk fell, special trains were laid on to whisk the ministers and their delegations away from the scene. Police called reserves in from all over the country to add to the 11,000 officers already on guard, and the umbrella protest group Inpeg, which organised the marches yesterday morning, criticised the violence. </p> <p>\"We're really disappointed,\" Chelsea Mosen, an Inpeg organiser, said last night. \"We were really hoping for a non-violent protest on the basic issues of the IMF and the World Bank but instead now the focus has shifted to the streets of Prague.\" </p> <p>Earlier in the day, the president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn told delegates to the conference that the protesters' message should be heard. </p> <p>\"I believe deeply that many of them are asking legitimate questions and I embrace the commitment of a new generation to fight poverty. I share their passion and questioning,\" he said. </p> <p>The confrontations are expected to continue today. Protest organisers have said that they \"aim to disrupt the meetings further\".</p>",
  "The great apes, including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, face extinction in the wild within a decade unless action is taken on their behalf, an alliance of the world's leading primate experts warned yesterday. <p>Multiple threats are now a fact of life for these members of the anthropoid apes. Their habitats are being destroyed by human encroachment, wars are creating barriers preventing their protection by zoologists, and their carcasses, as highly prized \"bushmeat\", are ending up on dinner tables, sometimes in Britain. </p> <p>Jane Goodall, the primatologist and conservationist, warned: \"The bushmeat trade, particularly in the great Congo basin, is the worst conservation dilemma Africa has faced in a century. It is no longer stable hunting [practised] by pygmies but hunters from towns going in on trucks and shooting everything, from elephants and chimpanzees to birds and rats.\" </p> <p>The meat is not to feed starving people. It is often sold at far higher prices than beef or goat meat and is destined for the plates of the rich. </p> <p>Dr Goodall called on the west to help African nations enforce conservation laws. She said there was so much corruption, just a small amount of money - but enough to represent a year's salary for some locals - paved the way for bushmeat's passage across international borders. </p> <p>Chimpanzee carcasses have been found in the kitchens of a Congolese restaurant in Antwerp, and a London butcher was raided by customs and excise last year after he sold investigators a young, endangered red-eared guenon monkey from Nigeria for \u00a3350. </p> <p>Primate meat is often smoked and exported from Africa packed into suitcases. Yesterday, a conservationist accompanied by the Guardian, found bushmeat - in this case a cane rat, a type of large rodent commonly known as a \"grasscutter\" - for sale at a food shop in Brixton, London. </p> <p>The shop's staff denied selling monkey meat, but one said: \"Chimpanzee are big animals like cattle. If somebody has it in abundance in his country - you eat cows, what is the difference?\" </p> <p>Stephen Brend, UK representative for the International Primate Protection League, said that while the cane rat was not endangered, its availability demonstrated the ease with which meat from wild African animals could be exported and sold in British shops. \"Grasscutters are caught in snares which can catch anything. If the avenues exist to get this into the country, I'm sure they can get in other forms of bushmeat.\" </p> <p>A coalition of 34 wildlife charities, the Ape Alliance, launched a campaign at the House of Commons yesterday aimed at galvanising public support for primates. </p> <p>Dr Goodall, who has been studying chimpanzees at Tanzania's Gombe national park for 40 years, told a Commons press conference that chimp numbers had declined dramatically: \"There were between one and two million chimpanzees 100 years ago across what was then the equatorial forest belt. There is not a forest belt any more, only shrinking patches of forest. There are at most 200,000 chimpanzees today, probably less, and diminishing all the time.\" </p> <p>The press conference heard from an Indonesian representative of an NGO, who spoke of his \"shame\" at the large scale illegal logging in one of the country's national parks, which involved a timber baron who is also a member of Indonesia's parliament. </p> <p>Invasion of the jungle by illegal loggers and goldminers threatens the orangutan, which depends on the trees for its survival, getting 90% of its food from the forest. </p> <p>Another primate, the bonobo, faces extinction in the sole country in which it lives. Jo Thompson, a bonobo specialist, said: \"This is the species we are likely to lose first. It only exists in one country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been invaded and occupied by seven nations in the last few years. We can't get any researchers into the field while the war is going on and researchers are the best protection.\" </p> <p>The Ape Alliance is urging governments to increase funding for conservation and ensure environmental impact assessments are carried out before Britain allocates aid or loans for development projects. </p> <p>Sir David Attenborough hosts a public lecture on the future of the great apes, at Westminster Central Hall, Storey's Gate, London SW1, at 7pm tonight. </p> <p>\u0095 Undi, a 10-year-old western lowland gorilla at Bristol zoo, who gave birth two months ago, died yesterday after a short illness.

  "The micro-scooter craze sweeping Britain claimed its first life yesterday when a nine-year-old boy was hit by a taxi and killed in Liverpool, bringing calls to remove the trendy toys from the roads. <p>Aaron Jennings was riding his scooter down a busy road in Anfield in the rush hour when he was hit by a black cab. He died from his injuries in hospital. </p> <p>Tony Hegarty, the boy's headteacher, said that he understood he had been in a group of seven or eight children playing on scooters after school. A witness said: \"He obviously thought he could get across the road on the scooter. The taxi driver had no chance to stop.\" </p> <p>Roger Vincent, of the Royal Society of the Prevention of Accidents, warned that unless micro-scooters were taken off the road, more deaths would follow. \"This death is our worst fear come true. We have been warning parents for several weeks to make their children aware of the danger. </p> <p>\"Children and adults should not ride these scooters in the road, under any circumstance. They should not cross the road on them, as motorists do not expect to find them on the road and can be easily surprised. Children are not in full control on these scooters, most of which do not have brakes. </p> <p>\"In 1998, 2,200 people in the UK were involved in accidents involving children's scooters. If you consider this was before the craze started, we expect to have a problem on our hands this year. </p> <p>\"Micro-scooter incidents in the US have risen by 700% since May. Most involved children under 15 who had taken scooters on to the road. We have to learn a lesson from that.\" Carol Sherriff, director of the Child Accident Prevention Trust, warned parents not to let their children out on micro-scooters unless they were in a safe area, off the road. </p> <p>Micro-scooters are similar in shape to normal push scooters, but are made of aircraft grade aluminium - making them foldable and easy to carry. Push-started, they can reach speeds of 20mph. </p> <p>Designed by Wim Ouboter, a Swiss inventor, they appeared on the market in 1998. But demands for the Ouboter scooters outstripped production, and there are 20 imitation brands on the market. More than 8,000 a week are sold in the UK, at an average of \u00a390 each; around 60% are sold in London. </p> <p>A Department of Transport spokesman said that use of scooters on pavements and roads was probably illegal, but it was a grey area of the law. </p> <p>\"It would appear that these scooters are covered by the same 1835 Highways Act that prevents cycles being ridden on pavements. But it is a matter for police to consider in local circumstances. This needs to be tested in court. It is a very tricky area.\" </p> <p>He said parents should make children aware of the dangers of micro-scooters. They should only be ridden on private land because they were not suitable for road use. \"All protection helps, and cycle helmets are very important, but we also recommend that knee and elbow pads are worn when riding these machines.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the corporation of London said that the City of London was involved in legal efforts to ban micro-scooters from paved walkways because of the danger they caused. She said a ban would not be enforced until early next year. </p> <p>Brian Croft, trading standards manager for Liverpool, said that trading standards officers all over Britain had received complaints about safety in the past fortnight. </p> <p>Importers Olop Leisure Group and retailers Woolworths were banned from selling the 900TT model of scooter this month after it failed part of a toy safety standard test. </p> <p>A 10-year-old girl from Slough had the top of her finger sliced off and a 15-year-old from Essex was injured when part of the folding mechanism trapped his finger. \"Accidents can range from children falling off scooters to misuse, incorrect assembly, and design and safety defects,\" Mr Croft said. </p> <p>\"The problem with micro-scooters is that because they are a craze, new models imported from Taiwan and China are coming on to the market all the time. </p> <p>\"British law does not require manufacturers to tell us how they have been tested. So we are at the mercy of importers and manufacturers to conduct their own safety tests. \"</p>",
  "Few Serbs are more delighted with the opposition's apparent election victory than Natasha Kandic, founder and director of the Humanitarian Law Centre in Belgrade. <p>She is champing to get back to the frontline where she has been working for several months with the student-based resistance movement, Otpor, which sparked the first major protests against Slobodan Milosevic's rule this spring and summer. </p> <p>\"This victory is a victory for young people,\" she told the Guardian in London, where she picked up an international human rights award last night. </p> <p>\"For the first time we have young people without any nationalistic views. They represent something new, hopeful, innocent, and with no burden of responsibility for the last 10 years.\" </p> <p>Several hundred members of Otpor have been questioned by Serbian police and briefly detained this year. Some have had to go into hiding. \"Otpor young people voted for [the leader of the democratic opposition] Vojislav Kostunica of course, but they did it from a distance. No one in the opposition, except for one party - Civic Alliance - gave them support when they needed it,\" she said. </p> <p>For all her optimism that the opposition's election victory has \"created space for discussion and change\", Ms Kandic has a sense of foreboding. \"Ordinary people refuse to think about next week. They just want to keep up this atmosphere of celebration. Milosevic is trying to buy time and decide what to do. He is surprised, angry and scared, and he may use force.\" </p> <p>Long before the Kosovo crisis reached a head with Nato's intervention, Ms Kandic and her small team of human rights workers regularly visited Kosovo to compile evidence of abuse by Serb police and Albanian freedom-fighters. </p> <p>They were almost the only Serbs who took an interest in atrocities by Serb forces. Now she campaigns for Albanians held in Serbian prisons, as well as for Serbs from Kosovo who were abducted by Albanian revenge-seekers after Nato-led troops reached the province. </p> <p>\"Two days after the bombing started, I went to Pristina. I saw a city without people. I saw fear. Maybe there will soon be the same atmosphere in Belgrade. Perhaps we cannot reach peace in Serbia without going through the same things as the other peoples of former Yugoslavia,\" she says. </p> <p>Some Albanians have called Ms Kandic a \"Serbian Schindler\". On one occasion, at the height of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo last year, she drove to Prizren to rescue the wife and young son of Baton Haxhiu, the editor of the newspaper Koha Ditore, who had been reported missing. </p> <p>Last month she had an astonishing exchange of letters in a Belgrade newspaper with the information officer of the general staff of the Yugoslav army, who accused her of supporting terrorism. </p> <p>In her reply Ms Kandic wrote: \"In Serbia today, the authorities put everyone, including children, under suspicion of being terrorists. When anyone dares to raise the question of the responsi bility of the Yugoslav army, you respond with secret trials. I am one of those people who refuses to remain silent, even at the cost of being brought to trial by you. </p> <p>\"I will not remain silent about the horrors your generals sent young recruits to witness in Kosovo. I can still see the anguish on the faces of 20-year-olds who gave their rations of milk, bread and cheese to Kosovo-Albanian mothers and children driven from their homes by the army and police. </p> <p>\"The road from Kosovoska Mitrovice to Pec and Djakovica on April 14 and 15 is engraved on my memory: a column of Albanian civilians, young soldiers going up to them with tears in their eyes, pleading with them to accept their food, to forgive them, saying it was not their fault, that their officers ordered them to Kosovo, that they did not know where they were being taken. Young soldiers were the bright light of humanity and life in other localities of Kosovo too. </p> <p>\"If you can find no one else to hold accountable for these events, you may count on me. I stand here and plead guilty because I did nothing to prevent these crimes from being committed. You rebuke me for not praising the Yugoslav army, the astuteness of its commanding generals, its high morale, good tactics and ingenious camouflaging. Do you really think the people of Serbia believe you fought against a flesh and blood enemy, those you label 'Nato criminals', and you won? Every casualty of the bombing is your casualty too. </p> <p>She was the first recipient last night of a new $50,000 (\u00a334,000) award offered by the Northcote Parkinson Fund of New York for \"civil courage - resisting evil at great personal risk\".</p>",
  "Euphoric but apprehensive, Serbia's opposition parties have planned a victory concert in Belgrade tonight, despite the state election commis sion's call for a runoff in the presidential contest. <p>Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader, has already said he will accept nothing less than a first-round victory. </p> <p>With 97% of the votes counted, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia said yesterday that by its unofficial tally Mr Kostunica had 54.6% and Slobodan Milosevic 35%. </p> <p>This result was supported by both the Belgrade-based Cen tre for Free Elections and Democracy and the far-right Serbian Radical party which ran its own candidate and is still nominally part of President Milosevic's coalition. </p> <p>Cedomir Jovanovic, the opposition spokesman, said: \"It is absolutely certain we have won, and so we request the federal election commission to erase all suspicion and not misuse this critical situation.\" </p> <p>He called on Mr Milosevic's Socialist party of Serbia and the Yugoslav United Left party to respect the popular will and cede power. If this did not happen, he said the opposition would protest peacefully. </p> <p>Meanwhile Miroslav Hristodulo, deputy president of the Social Democratic Union, said before yesterday's runoff announcement that if the election commission denied Mr Kostunica outright victory, nightly demonstrations would take place from tomorrow. </p> <p>Asked about the future of Serbian hardliners who have been indicted by the international criminal tribunal in the Hague, he said Mr Kostunica's plan was retribution rather than revenge. There would be proper law and proper trials, he said. </p> <p>Few observers believed that the opposition would come together so smoothly to give the country's disillusioned voters a respected figure to support. </p> <p>Massive campaigns to mobilise voters were organised by non-governmental groups, women's organisations and the student resistance group Otpor. </p> <p>Another opposition tactic - to provide an efficient and credible vote-reporting service - caught the Milosevic regime off guard. </p> <p>Politika, a pro-government newspaper, published partial local election results yesterday that noted opposition victories in many towns. </p> <p>A Socialist party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, also admitted at a press conference that the government had lost some towns, but declared its overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections. He made no mention of the presidential poll. Some saw this as a sign that the government would eventually back down. </p> <p>\"If they have already recognised such a crushing defeat in all the municipalities, there is no chance for them to tamper with other results now,\" said Mladjan Dinkic, coordinator of the G-17 Plus group of academics and professionals. </p> <p>In another sign of the opposition leader's acceptance within the country, the head of the Serbian Orthodox church, Patriarch Pavle, received Mr Kostunica yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>In Theodore Roszak's 1991 novel Flicker - a wonderfully mind-bending paranoid thriller about cinema history - the future, and the end, of film is discovered in the shape of a teenage auteur called Simon Dunkle. He is the nihilistic genius behind avant-garde horror works such as Insect Anxiety and the apocalyptic Sub Sub, a film said to initiate a new genre, \"genocidal farce\". Dunkle outdoes even these with The Lonesome Lovesong of the Sad Sewer Babies, a work so disturbing that the novel's narrator deems it not so much a movie as \"a kind of optical acid that burns through from the eye straight down into the vital organs\". </p> <p>Flicker proposed the horrifying, yet strangely thrilling, possibility that cinema would soon belong to lawless infant-savants like Simon Dunkle. We haven't really seen one yet - even Harmony Korine seems too benignly cinephilic to qualify. However, I can think of one film-maker who has consistently been disturbing enough to come close to the Dunkle aesthetic, and that is Chris Cunningham, the British music video director whose work features in the Royal Academy's Apocalypse show. </p> <p>The exhibition's subtitle is Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art, and Cunningham is familiar with both. He has done futuristic beauty in the video for Bjork's All Is Full of Love, with the star playing two auto-erotic porcelain robots. And he has done horror in his videos for Aphex Twin, in which swarms of delinquent brats and siliconed hip-hop molls all wear the distorted features of Aphex mastermind Richard James. These grotesquely comic vignettes are not only the antithesis of MTV-friendly, they are unfriendly, period. And they make you want to see - and shudder at the thought of seeing - a feature film made by this man. </p> <p>Instead, Cunningham has taken a detour into the art world, and now exhibits at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery. But his 15-minute film, Flex, showing there and in Apocalypse, is surprisingly low-key. A naked man and woman, lit in bilious green, confront each other in darkness, exchange brutal volleys of blows, screw just as convulsively, and finally, coupling in mid-air, are struck by a ray of light that vaporises them. Who would have imagined Cunningham producing romantic abstraction of such a transcendentalist strain? </p> <p>Flex is less disturbing than it seems on paper - a coupling of brutality and beauty. What makes it transcend the apparent banality of its topic is the execution, the meticulous sound design and machine-gun editing. It's a work to be heard and felt as much as seen. </p> <p>Cunningham began as a teenage special-effects expert, working on Alien 3 and Stanley Kubrick's abortive AI project. He is not alone: sculptor Ron Mueck was a movie animatronics specialist (he also worked on Alien 3), and he too is currently at Anthony d'Offay with his waxily lifelike human figures. </p> <p>Mueck and Cunningham have moved from what you could patronise as the merely \"lifelike\" to work that strives to address the human condition. But you shouldn't dismiss the visceral impetus of effects work. The purest example I ever saw was a stall at a Spanish horror film festival. It was laden with hundreds of latex horror models - all gouged eyes, severed limbs, ripped bellies disgorging rubbery entrails. You fairly retched to look at them, but you could hardly take your eyes away. </p> <p>We usually expect art proper to demand a more complex reaction than that, but in fact one work in the Apocalypse exhibition made me react quite similarly to the Spanish atrocity exhibition - Hell, Jake and Dinos Chapman's Holocaust installation. However repelled I felt, I couldn't stop peering at it; yet that fascination stood in the way of any coherent critical reaction to it. </p> <p>At Apocalypse, Chris Cunningham and Jake and Dinos have somehow reversed career paths. The former sci-fi robotics nerd has moved away from pure effect into a more contemplative, impressionistic realm. Meanwhile, the Chapmans have reverted to teenage special-effects artists with their meticulously constructed Airfix landscape of horror. Hell, their very own \"genocidal farce\", makes them the true Simon Dunkles.</p> <p>Chris Cunningham and Ron Mueck are at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery, W1 (020-7499 4100) till October 17. Apocalypse is at the Royal Academy, W1 (020-7300 8000) till December 15.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to a special 80s has-been Court Circular this week, featuring two of the most desperate cases you could ever find in legalistic strife. Kicking off the action is 80s has-been TV actor <strong> Jan-Michael Vincent</strong>, the former Airwolf star whose life since the demise of said show has routinely made supermarket tabloid headlines. And now he's finally wound up inside, after being sentenced to 60 days in an Orange County, California lock-up for repeated probation violations, culminating in an argument with his wife which led to \"pushing and hair-pulling\". Regular readers of this column may already be aware of the hapless Vincent's troubled history, dating back - at least - to 1996, with an arrest for drunk-driving following a car crash that left him partially paralysed; since then, the erstwhile pin-up has been arrested three times this year alone, on one occasion being discovered by police rolling around in the grass in Santa Monica with over three times the legal blood-alcohol limit coursing through his veins. Currently in rehab, Vincent's jail sentence begins later this week, after which he's to return to the clinic on an indefinite basis. </p> <p>And then there's 80s has-been rock star <strong> Rick Springfield</strong>, whose career after the global smash hit that was Jesse's Girl has followed a similar trajectory to our friend Jan-Michael, right down to his arrest in Malibu last week for spousal assault. Springfield's run-in with the law came after a heated domestic argument was overheard by his sister-in-law, who then called 911; although the ruckus later subsided, police nonetheless turned up at the singer's house and - upon noticing \"minor injuries\" to his wife's face - took him down for an evening in LA County Jail.

Although a rapist can face execution, he can only be convicted on the basis of a confession or the evidence of four witnesses - so many rapes go unreported. </p> <p>The law is just one of many areas in which Saudi Arabia discriminates against women, Amnesty says. \"Discrimination against women touches virtually all aspects of their lives, including family life, decision-making, employment, education and the justice system,\" the report says. </p> <p>It notes, however, that issues of women's rights - once a taboo subject in the kingdom - are gradually being aired. </p> <p>Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, in charge of the day-to-day running of the kingdom, spoke on television about the need to include women in the country's development. And a Saudi news magazine, al- Majalla, recently published a ground-breaking feature on \"the issue that society does not like to discuss\" - domestic violence. </p> <p>Although there are no official figures on the number of men who are prosecuted for assaulting their wives, the state tolerates men who chastise their wives for disobedience, Amnesty says, although they are not supposed to cause pain or injury. </p> <p>Amnesty says there is a widespread perception that police officers will not look favourably upon a domestic-abuse complaint by a woman. In some cases, they simply send the woman back home, where she may suffer further abuse. </p> <p>The workplace is another area of discrimination, it says. </p> <p>Although Saudi women hold 40% of the private wealth and own 15,000 businesses, they cannot carry out many normal business activities. </p> <p>The report calls on the Saudi government to ratify international conventions on women's rights and to carry out a comprehensive review of its legislation.</p>",
  "He was the strangest bundle of contradictions. This was the poet who wrote, of country clergymen, that they were \"Toppled into the same graves/ With oafs and yokels,\" but was a country clergyman himself, the oafs and yokels the ancestors of his own parishioners. \"I suppose that did shock the bourgeoisie,\" said RS Thomas, who has died aged 87. <p>A poem started, \"Men of the hills, wantoners, men of Wales/ With your sheep and your pigs and your ponies, your sweaty females/ How I have hated you ...\" - and the man who wrote that was such an extreme nationalist he could not support Plaid Cymru because it recognised the English parliament. </p> <p>If he was a puzzle to his English-reading public, just think how much more so he was to his own countrymen, for this was a Holyhead man, the product of the town's schools, who spoke the English language without the trace of a Welsh accent - spoke it, in fact, with all the coldness and weariness of its own ruling class. For almost half a century, he was married to an English woman, and when I asked him once if she had not objected to his banging on about her race, he said, \"Amor vincit omnia.\" His son went to an English boarding school. </p> <p>He was in Who's Who, but, at one point, that would have told you more about the private lives of the old Soviet leaders. There was a name, \"THOMAS, Ronald Stuart\", followed by the reason for its inclusion - \"poet\" - but, after that, just a list of church livings and of books, also an address, for he was a vicar, after all. But there was no record of parents, marriage, fatherhood, not even a date of birth. </p> <p>In old age, he relented and supplied most of these, even throwing in his Queen's medal for poetry but, unlike the gardening, fishing, motoring princes of his church, never did add \"recreations\". There was only one, birdwatching, and this was there in the poems - just as everything else was there in the poems. </p> <p>It is the dilemma of the lyric poet that his material is his own life, his commodity intimacy. So Thomas Hardy, in old age, sent up a smokescreen against future biographers by guardedly writing an autobiography, which he then got his wife to publish after his death under her own name. RS Thomas wrote his in Welsh, and called it Neb - nobody. </p> <p>There was mischief in this, for the answers his admirers sought were in a language they could not understand. But it also reflected the bitterness which danced attendance on him as he grew old, that he had learnt his native language too late in life to write poetry in it. \"All those words, and me outside them.\" </p> <p>To adapt what someone said of de Gaulle, Thomas had one illusion, Wales, and one hate, the Welsh, who had been born into a tradition they neglected, and which he, like a tramp at Christmas, was doomed to stand outside. He said once that there had been no personal influences on his life, no guiding schoolmaster or tutor - and little contact later with anyone who could be considered his peer. He took no newspapers, entertained no friends. He was the loneliest man I ever met. </p> <p>It was partly the loneliness of the country priest, cut off by his cloth and learning, but a lot more was deliberate. He felt so cut off from the modern world, with its cult of personality, that, in the autobiography, he referred to himself throughout in the third person - as \"the boy\", \"RS\", \"the rector\" - as though watching himself, often with startled interest, from space. He could take this sense of distance to hair-raising lengths, as when, asked whether he felt lonely after the death of his wife, he said he sometimes felt lonely when she was alive. It is one thing to encounter bleak honesty in the poems, but quite another to encounter it in conversation. </p> <p>\"It was difficult to talk to Mr Thomas,\" a reporter wrote disgruntledly. \"He makes it almost obsessively clear that he does not suffer fools, or foolish things, easily.\" </p> <p>He would not have recognised the self-portrait of the autobiography, of a figure encased in innocence, who accommodated the ambitions and needs of others. Thomas's mother, a domineering and possessive woman, thought the priesthood a safe career; he became a priest. His wife wanted a child (\"the possibility of this had not entered his mind\") - and the child was, born, \"with his huge hunger,\" wrote the poet who could also start a poem, \"Dear parents/ I forgive you my life.\" </p> <p>He was a sea captain's son, read Latin at University College, Bangor, where he also played rugby - the forbid ding initials stemmed from the team lists, which contained more than one Thomas - was ordained, and married the painter Elsi Eldridge, then an art teacher at Oswestry high school. They had one son, Gwydion, a lecturer in education, who never learnt Welsh, unlike his father, who did so at the age of 30. </p> <p>The relationship between Thomas and his country was a strange one. It began and ended in Holyhead, so what lay between was an odyssey - from Chirk, his first curacy, on the border, to Manafon, a border parish, to another in mid-Wales, and to the last, at Aberdaron, at the western edge of Wales. This should have been a progres sion into the heart of Welshness, only it wasn't; there was much black comedy about the odyssey. </p> <p>Those who knew only the public figure of his later years, with his bitter pronoucements on English incomers - \"the cantankerous clergyman,\" \"the fiery poet-priest\" - would have been startled to meet him in his beginnings, the curate trudging dutifully towards his weekly lesson with a copy of Welsh Made Easy under his arm. But then, there was also comedy about the later years, when, in the Welsh heartland, he met English pensioners in their holiday homes (\"an Elsan culture/ Threatens us\"). It was this which produced the public figure, when the press picked up the chance remark that he could understand the motives of those who burnt down these cottages. </p> <p>There were many interviews then, and many photographs of a wild, gaunt face against the sky, or scowling over the half-door of the 16th-century cottage to which he had retired. Controversy surfaced again when he was nominated for the Nobel prize in his 82nd year, for it had been largely forgotten that this ogre was also the finest living lyric poet, ironically, in the English language. </p> <p>Acclaim came late. Thomas was 42 when Rupert Hart-Davis brought out Song At The Year's Turning, before which there had been just one book, printed at his own expense, and a few poems in magazines. John Betjeman contributed a preface, in which he wrote, \"The name which has the honour to introduce this fine poet to a wider public will be forgotten long before that of RS Thomas.\" </p> <p>There were some generous reviews, Kingsley Amis calling him \"one of the best half-dozen poets now writing in English,\" and, by the time Selected Poems appeared 20 years later, an anonymous reviewer in the TLS was starting to use words like \"major poetry\". Suddenly, nobody was making the old charge, that Thomas was a \"limited\" poet. </p> <p>Yet it was easy to see why it had been made. He wrote about the hill farmers he had met in his first parish, a people and a way of life very few of his readers would have encountered. He wrote about religious faith, when, for many, this would have held only an historical interest. He attacked modern life, modern technology, the English encroaching into Wales and the Welsh responsible for the decay of their own culture and language. </p> <p>There is no comfort in any of these poems. \"Too far for you to see/ The fluke and the foot-rot and the fat maggot/ Gnawing the skin from the small bones./ The sheep are grazing at Bwlch-y-Fedwen,/ Arranged romantically in the usual manner/ On a bleak background of bald stone.\" The hill farmer, at one moment a cosmic symbol of endurance is also greedy, joyless, physically repugnant. </p> <p>There is no comfort in the religious poetry either, and no answers. One, called Earth, begins: \"What made us think/ It was yours? Because it was signed/ With your blood, God of battles?\" Yet there is a grim compassion for the hill farmer, and there is the odd abrupt burst of lyricism, when the poet is caught off-guard by the beauty of the natural world. </p> <p>But the tone is inevitably the bleak, ruthlessly honest note Thomas now made his own. There is also a hardness about his rhythms, and a clarity about his words and images (\"Who put the crease in your soul, Davies?\") that preserved him from the misanthropy and the ranting into which some of his attitudes could have betrayed him. </p> <p>Later, he added God to his dramatis personae, a cold figure indifferent to His creation, and there were small collections with titles like H'm, in which the main emotions seemed to be weariness and disgust. \"Just souring old age,\" said Thomas. \"My mother used to ask my father, 'Haven't you a good word to say about anybody?' He thought for a long time and said 'No'.\" </p> <p>But it was an industrious disgust, for he wrote on and on, and it was startling to be reminded of just how many small collections there had been when the Collected Poems appeared, a volume of 500 pages, of near-Victorian dimensions. In old age, the poems were increasingly abstract, God increasingly absent - though much addressed - so the bursts of lyricism were winter sunlight. This is on the death of his wife: </p> <p> We met </p> <p>under a shower </p> <p>of bird-notes. </p> <p>Fifty years passed </p> <p>love's moment </p> <p>in a world in </p> <p>servitude to time. </p> <p>She was young; </p> <p>I kissed with my eyes </p> <p>closed and opened </p> <p>them on her wrinkles. </p> <p>\"Come,\" said death, </p> <p>choosing her as his </p> <p>partner for </p> <p>the last dance. And she, </p> <p>who in life </p> <p>had done everything </p> <p>with a bird's grace, </p> <p>opened her bill now </p> <p>for the shedding </p> <p>of one sigh no </p> <p> heavier than a feather. </p> <p>I met him when I was 17. He suggested we have tea in a hotel on the seafront at Aberystwyth, but in summer there are many clerical collars in Aberystwyth. A fat man in specs passed, and I hoped it would not be him, then a cheerful chap with a pipe, and I hoped it would not be him either. But then a third man came, a tall, lean athletic man bent against the wind - and it was the face of the poems. </p> <p>When I wrote about it later, I used adjectives like \"hard\" and \"severe\", and had the phrase \"almost predatory\". By return of post came a letter from Thomas, in which he signed himself \"Nimrod\". That sense of humour, faint and dry, and so baffling to the young, was the strangest of all his contradictions. </p> <p>He is survived by his son and his second wife, Elisabeth Vernon. </p> <p> The Rev Ronald Stuart Thomas, priest and poet, born March 29 1913; died September 25 2000</p>",
  "<p>George Weah scored twice in the space of five minutes last night but to the great man's disgust his Manchester City team were then obliged to put in an extra 30-minute shift as Andy Thomson knocked in his own second of the game. </p> <p>However, it was City who were left celebrating with Paul Dickov and Mark Kennedy scoring vital late goals. </p> <p>Both sides were a goalscorer light with City missing Paulo Wanchope who had a knee injury and the home team forced to plan without Carl Asaba because of a nagging achilles. </p> <p>Gillingham's leading scorer was replaced by Thomson who was on target in last season's FA Cup victories over Bradford and Sheffield Wednesday and whose instinct for an upset served him well again with 25 minutes gone. </p> <p>Before that Gillingham had shown much the keener appetite for the game and had made the City rearguard look a flimsy article indeed, with Nick Weaver forced to dive to his right to beat out a Marcus Browning drive. </p> <p>As well as Thomson seized his chance, neatly side-stepping a defender before tucking a shot inside Weaver's near post, the opening owed a lot to Paul Ritchie directing a loose header across the area. </p> <p>George Weah responded by aiming low and hard at Vince Bartram as did Paul Dickov. Neither asked too much of the keeper who earlier had been grateful to Barry Ashby's posi tioning on the goalline after Danny Tiatto had broken through. </p> <p>Mark Kennedy had replaced Ritchie towards the end of the first half and in the first few minutes following the restart he stood the tie on its head with a high corner nodded in by Weah and low cross bungled in by the same player. </p> <p>Now City were in control but Gillingham refused to be bowed and nine minutes from the end they took the game into extra time with a close in jab from Thomson after Guy Butters had met a corner kick. </p> <p> <strong> Gillingham</strong> (3-5-2): Bartram; Ashby, Hope, Butters; Southall, Smith, Hessenthaler, Browning, Edge; King, Thomson. </p> <p><strong> Manchester City</strong> (4-3-3): Weaver; Crooks, Haaland, Jobson, Ritchie (Kennedy, 37); Whitley, Wiekens, Horlock; Dickov, Weah, Tiatto. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> R Furnandiz (Doncaster).</p>",
  "<p>The government's NHS plan has promised us thousands more health professionals, not only to overcome staff shortages faced in many areas but also to expand provision through extra hospital and intermediate care beds, GP surgeries and nurse-led, walk-in centres. </p> <p>All of this is excellent news. But there is one small problem. All the extra money and all the promises on paper will make no difference unless thousands of willing people decide to work for the NHS. </p> <p>Skilled people are the single most important resource for any health service. At present, they are also the most scarce - and the prospects of keeping them are not good. Growing proportions of nurses and inner-city GPs are nearing retirement age. Many more health workers are moving into the private sector, or to job opportunities outside the health system, and are not being replaced by sufficient new recruits. </p> <p>A recent King's Fund report, The Last Straw, found that NHS nurses were unhappy about poor pay, bleak conditions and chronic shortages of basic resources that they experience on a daily basis. They were frustrated by inflexible working arrangements, limited career development opportunities and lack of control over their working environment. Racist harassment and discrimination were also strongly in evidence. The implications of these findings for the recruitment and retention of health workers are considerable. </p> <p>There is a wider issue here, too, which should be of concern to anyone who works for, or with, the public sector. The concept of public service, which in recent history has been a source of pride and commitment, has gradually fallen into disrepute. Ambitious young people, leaving schools and universities, no longer see public service as the height of personal achievement. Instead, it is associated with ponderous bureaucracy, political manipulation, poor opportunities and low pay. </p> <p>If the government wants to succeed with its NHS plan, it must make public service seem worthwhile to a wider group of people. Ministers must show they value public sector workers, not just by saying so, but by demonstrating their commitment in practice. They must provide bigger pay packets, better (and broader) career opportunities, more flexible working arrangements and much more of a chance for workers at all levels to influence how services are run. </p> <p>The concept of public service, wrapped up in the values of another century, looks dated. The challenge for ministers is to build a new vision of public service that harnesses the values of equity and altruism, as well as chiming with the personal goals of the kinds of people the state needs to get to work for it - and for all of us.</p>"
