  "<p>Forget technology, media and telecoms. In the past six months, TMT has stood for Trauma, Mayhem and Tragedy as the British Techmark index and the Nasdaq, the US equivalent, have fallen by more than 40 per cent. So why has Barclays Global Investors chosen this month to launch yet another product to invest in TMT companies? </p> <p>The answer is twofold. First, the best time to buy is often when no one else wants to. Those who bought shares after the 1987 stock market crash did very nicely; those who followed the herd into the market just before the crash took years just to get their money back. </p> <p>But the main reason BGI has chosen now to launch its iShare, the iFTSE TMT fund, is that the Stock Exchange has only just launched the index it will track. </p> <p>Like a tracker fund, iShares follow a particular index but, while trackers are unit trusts that invest in the components of the index, iShares are shares in their own right. If used correctly, they can be a lot cheaper than unit trusts. There is no upfront fee, while unit trusts can charge anything up to 5 per cent as an initial fee. The annual charge is also low - 0.5 per cent, against up to 2 per cent for a unit trust. </p> <p>But you will have to pay stockbrokers' commission whenever you buy and sell. If you shop around, you should be able to find a broker to deal in small amounts of shares for around \u00a315, but you would obviously not want to buy and sell too often. The best deal is from Comdirect, the Internet broker, which will allow you to deal in iShares as often as you like for a fixed \u00a325 a year. </p> <p>There will also be a differ ence between the price at which you buy and sell the shares, called the spread. But, with the existing iShare, which tracks the FTSE 100, the spread has been less than 5p, less than you would pay in stamp duty on a traditional share. iShares, by a quirk of the legislation, are free of stamp duty. </p> <p>The iFTSE TMT will have a fairly narrow remit. To qualify, companies must be in the FTSE 350 index, involved in the TMT sectors and trade on the Stock Exchange's automated dealing system, Sets. Currently, 36 companies qualify, including Vodafone, BT and Sage. </p> <p>Some of the companies are so large - Vodafone, for example, would represent more than 36 per cent of the fund - that the Stock Ex-change has introduced a weighting system. Thus, the top 10 components by value will be limited to 4 per cent of the new index. The next 10, 3.5 per cent and so on. </p> <p>That will still mean a high level of exposure to just a few companies, with only 20 accounting for 75 per cent of the fund. John Demaine, managing director of BGI, says investors should expect it to be highly volatile. </p> <p>Technology shares may have fallen sharply but many observers feel there could be further to go. Those who are still keen on the market should consider iShares as a good way in - but it may be worth waiting a few weeks.</p>",
  "<p>A black van driver unfairly disciplined at work has become one of the first people to benefit from the formation of a new racial discrimination legal advice unit. </p> <p>Kofi Asiedu was physically assaulted by his line manager at Euro Car Parts in Bellingham, south-east London, in August last year following an argument over a delivery. Mr Asiedu said at tribunal that his manager had called him a 'black prat' during the assault. The manager was given a verbal warning over the incident after making a full apology for the assault. But when Mr Asiedu complained about the attack, he was issued a final written warning which dragged up 10 minor disciplinary offences occurring over several years. </p> <p>Outraged, Mr Asiedu resigned and contacted the Race Discrimination Unit at the North Lambeth Law Centre in south London. The unit is designed to provide free legal advice and representation to people who are claiming racial discrimination in their workplace. </p> <p>Lawrence Davies, a solicitor and project manager for the unit, says the help provided is vital for those unable to afford legal advice and representation. Limited legal aid is available leading up to an employment tribunal (typically two hours' work at \u00a345 an hour, compared with the rate of \u00a370 for other legal aid work), but this is woefully inadequate to prepare a complicated case and no aid is provided for representation in the tribunal itself. Davies says: 'At present, 65 to 70 per cent of race claimants are not represented at tribunal, and only 5 per cent of unrepresented applicants win their cases.' </p> <p>Davies believes most claimants fail because they do not understand the legal processes or jargon involved in presenting a case. And they usually face fearsome opposition. 'For every litigant representing himself or herself, the employer has one or two sharp, experienced lawyers, and they tear them apart,' he says. </p> <p>To qualify for help from the unit, a claimant must live in a borough of London, have a case which has a reasonable chance of winning, and fall below a notional income limit (based on earnings, size of family and debts). Davies says the unit would probably not take on a single person earning more than \u00a320,000, or a couple with combined earnings of more than \u00a330,000. While these limits may seem high, so is the expense of taking your employer to court. The average discrimination tribunal costs between \u00a35,000 and \u00a37,000 to prepare and present. And Davies says even those earning substantial salaries can find themselves in need of free legal help: 'When people are discriminated against, they often become stressed and unwell. You are likely to be signed off work and often end up on statutory sick pay of about \u00a350 a week.' </p> <p>The Race Discrimination Unit is a collaboration between the North Lambeth Law Centre and barristers at Two Garden Court, a set of chambers specialising in human rights work. The barristers are providing 100 days' tribunal representation at less than legal aid rates. The unit's catchment area comprises 12 million people, and the response since its launch in May has been strong, with 90 cases in the pipeline, three that have already concluded at tribunal but await compensation decisions, and eight that have settled out of court, producing total compensation of more than \u00a3160,000. </p> <p>Despite its success, the future of the unit is already threatened. Its first year has been funded to the tune of \u00a3150,000 by the Commission for Racial Equality whose core funding was supplemented by the Home Office. Another \u00a3100,000 was won by the Northern Complainant Aid Fund in Bradford to represent race claimants in the Midlands. But although CRE funding will go up next year, it expects an increase in demands on its resources, and there is no guarantee that the Race Discrimination Unit's funding will be renewed. Implementation of the Race Relations Amendment Bill early next year is likely to result in an increase in discrimination cases over stop and searches by the police and mental health sectioning. </p> <p>Others had been hopeful that the recently implemented Human Rights Convention would enable people to claim legal aid for representation at an employment tribunal. Article Six of the convention, which covers the right to a fair trial, states: 'In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.' </p> <p>However, Michael Burd, employment specialist at solicitors Lewis Silkin, is sceptical: 'The Government will fight this tooth and nail.' He believes the Government, which has dramatically reduced the number of firms handling legal aid cases from 11,000 in 1999 to 5,000 this year, will argue that claimants should be able to secure representation through the conditional fee agreement where the lawyer is only paid a fee if he wins the case. 'But unless you have got a case that's a dead cert, you are unlikely to want to take it on this basis.' </p> <p>Davies points out that even when a claimant's case is strong, a contingency fee offers little incentive to most lawyers: 'The average award for discrimination is between \u00a36,000 and \u00a38,000. This is bad business for solicitors on a 20 per cent contingency fee: they can earn much more by doing far less stressful and complex work.' </p> <p>Mr Asiedu, like many others who have faced discrimination in the workplace, did not have the skills to present his case at tribunal. But with the help of the Race Discrimination Unit, he has won. And although he is seeking a five-figure compensation payment, he says: 'I feel wonderful. It's not about the money but justice has been done.' </p> <p>\u0095 For further information contact the Race Discrimination Unit on 0207 793 0378, or visit <a href=\"http://www.rdu.org.uk\">www.rdu.org.uk</a>.

  "<p>It has never been music to potter around the house to, or to sip cocktails to, or to wake up to on a bright Sunday morning: Polly Jean Harvey's music has always been reserved for those long, dark nights of the soul - guaranteed to make us feel much worse, but somehow better at the same time. It has been her job to Feel Our Pain. Her songs have been bleak, angry, ghoulish. And Harvey herself, all paper-doll fragility, has always been the incarnation of angst, yowling her scary, disconcerting lyrics about unsettling things (voodoo, drowning, coffins, guns). She may never have possessed the distinctive grandeur of her most obvious predecessor, Patti Smith, but she blazed a trail of slow-burning sensuality, fury and eccentricity that helped bring women's rock out of the margins and into the charts in the late 90s. She was always a cut above the maudlin Morissettes and Phairs of this world. The only trouble was that, after a while, Harvey seemed to have so much more pain to feel than the rest of us could muster. </p> <p>Until recently, that is. There were signs of a slight breeziness on her last album, and there are tracks on the latest one that even have an optimism and lightness of touch previously unheard of from the supposed cauldron-stirring lady of darkness. In the flesh, though not exactly serene-looking, Harvey looks tanned and fit, as opposed to pallid and unwell, formerly her salient characteristics. She's tiny, but not spectrally thin, as she has been in the past, and she has strikingly large, long-lashed, hazel eyes and a wide, full mouth that goes slightly wonky when she speaks in her soft, West Country lilt. She has an intense, measured way about her. She's very still and composed, speaking confidently but also cautiously, articulating each sentence carefully. </p> <p>She says that her new album, Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea, is so named not so much because of the locations in which it was written (New York and Dorset), but because she has always liked the Jungian notion of \"the sea being the subconscious and the land the conscious\". The creative process draws from reality, she says, but also from the imagination, and is about returning to the imagination that we had as children. \"It seems to me that we spend a lot of our lives trying to get back to that simplicity, the vibrant imagination, we had as kids.\" </p> <p>She's not nostalgic about her childhood, though - \"I don't dwell too much on things that have gone. I try and live on a day-to-day basis\" - and won't go into enormous detail about her childhood, because she doesn't want to. But she does say that Dorset was a wonderful place to grow up, and \"alive with ideas and the space in which to create them\". Her mother, a sculptor, and her father, a stonemason, brought up their daughter to the sound of Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, John Lee Hooker. The Harveys lived near a remote village with a population of 600, and their house, along with a few others, was set apart. There was no shop, just a post office and a telephone box. Polly used to hang around with a group of local boys. \"We had a gang in our offshoot village, and there were just boys. No girls to play with.\" Harvey began playing piano, violin and saxophone at the age of 11, and then taught herself to play the guitar at 18 - she'd been interested in writing since she was a child, and found that it was a good way to bring words and music together. </p> <p>Now 30, Harvey still lives for most of the time in Dorset, in a house by the sea. She's very close to her parents, and always plays them early demo tapes of her albums, because she respects their opinion and because they have a lot of musical knowledge and interest. \"It seems appropriate,\" she says. Having bohemian parents, her teenage rebellion took a rather different form than most. \"My rebellious stage was probably when I started buying Duran Duran records instead of listening to Captain Beefheart,\" she laughs, \"and my mum was, like, 'What on earth are you listening to?'\" </p> <p>She was 20 years old when she moved to London, and decided to defer a place to study sculpture at St Martin's art school in favour of signing a record deal. But the transfer from the countryside - and from the bosom of such a tightknit family - was a shock. In 1992, she released Dry. It was a jagged, raw album, drawing on swampy blues, with hints of Patti Smith, Captain Beefheart and grunge thrown in - the songs were angry and intense, the vocal style was a distinctive, banshee-like roar. Everything started happening at once, she says, and what should have been an exciting time, full of hope, turned into a nightmare - and the first of two nervous breakdowns. </p> <p>For a start, she was unprepared for press interviews, she says. \"I'd had quite a sheltered upbringing, and was very open and honest, and so went to interviews totally unprotected.\" Of course, that candour did her public profile absolutely no harm - she was an interviewer's dream, but she believes it harmed her. \"I was just wide open, and got damaged because of it, and ended up feeling very invaded.\" At the time, she was struggling with money, negotiating with solicitors, managers (she went through two of them) and agents. \"It was quite frightening, and all too much. Then my personal life was in tatters at the same time [she had split from photographer Joe Dilworth]. I don't know what the definition of a nervous breakdown is. I just know that I stopped functioning properly, and I was unable to look after myself, and everything kind of fell apart.\" She went back home to Dorset and \"shut off for a while\". </p> <p>The follow-up album, Rid Of Me, was no less harrowing or dark, and still full of fury and naked emotion - on the title track, she toyed with male fears of the Fatal Attraction-style bunny-boiling woman. It was her most relentless, hit-free album. The third, To Bring You My Love, was less emotionally direct but intense nonetheless, earning her a place on the Mercury Prize shortlist and a clutch of Grammy nominations. Until then, her appearance had been austere - scraped-back hair, no make-up - but with the release in 1995 of To Bring You My Love, she underwent a Ziggy Stardust-style transformation, appearing at Glastonbury in a smoulderingly glamorous ensemble of pink catsuit and exaggerated false eyelashes. \"The songs could carry it,\" she says of her image at the time. \"I've always enjoyed dressing up, and I wanted to experiment with it.\" There was a dark, theatrical edge to her performances, and her distorted, wailing told of drowned daughters and voodoo rituals. The glam image had to do with something else as well, she says: \"There was confusion with myself at that time as to who or what I was, and it was a way of looking for answers.\" </p> <p>Another breakdown ensued. The period from the end of 1995 until 1997 was a \"very dark time\", she says. By the tail end of 1995 she had been on tour for a year and was \"very worn and very disillusioned. Emotionally, mentally or physically, it wasn't a healthy time. I was running on empty. I'd kind of lost sight of why I was doing this, and I don't think that would've happened if I'd have been of stronger mind and body but, as it was, I was just very low, so I really hit the bottom of the barrel and thought about stopping it all and not even continuing with music. Even through to Dance Hall At Louse Point [a dance collaboration with John Parish and choreographer Mark Bruce], it was a very difficult time in my life, probably the hardest time I've ever had.\" She says she's not sure why it happened a second time around. \"I just think every individual is predisposed to behaving in certain ways under certain conditions, and I think it was a mixture of the person that I am, the spirit that I have, and being in those situations that wasn't right for me at that time.\" </p> <p>She was also, of course, painfully thin - and lurid rumours abounded. The phrase \"self-loathing\" was used a lot: it seemed to tally well with her nihilistic lyrics. It was generally assumed that she was anorexic; Courtney Love, a great admirer, once pointed out that one of Harvey's lyrics about lying in a glass coffin was, in Jungian theory, an image representing an eating disorder. \"I think that everyone's entitled to their own opinion,\" Harvey says carefully. \"Certainly, when I used that image I wasn't thinking about that at the time. I was probably thinking more of Snow White. Maybe Snow White was anorexic,\" she laughs. It may be that her skeletal appearance was due to something entirely different. In any case, it's not something she has ever talked about publicly, or admitted to. \"That's a conscious decision,\" she says firmly. \"And I'm not going to talk about it now. That's no one's business but my own.\" She went to stay with friends in Bristol. \"I had a lot of support around me.\" She went into psychotherapy. Is This Desire?, a rather more upbeat album, followed in 1998. </p> <p>But it is the new album that really shows Polly Jean Harvey in a different light. There are still the angry moments of visceral guitar rock for which she has become known, and the hallmark blues and orchestral balladry are there, too, albeit more finely honed. But there's a new mood that is less claustrophobic, less sinister and more positive, both lyrically and musically. She produced and performed all the tracks, along with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey. The vocals are less technically distorted than on previous ones, which sometimes goes in her favour and sometimes doesn't - there is the occasional moment when she seems to be struggling to hit the note - but it's a beautiful, seductive album, and probably her most commercial and accessible to date. The country-inflected ballad, You Said Something, for instance, and the elegiac, piano-filled We Float, with its soaring vocals, are gorgeous, and there are Bj\u00f6rkish touches in the love song, Beautiful Feeling. Then there's This Mess We're In, a soft duet with the haunting voice of Thom Yorke of Radiohead. She finds Yorke's voice very moving: \"He's an extremely good songwriter, and instrumentally they're a very strong band. They do seem to be looking for new ground all the time, which is admirable, and very exciting to see and to hear.\" It has been said that Polly Harvey is the female version of Radiohead and that, just as the music of Thom Yorke mythologises male confusion and dysfunction, so hers represents the female equivalent. She doesn't see it, however: \"They're just songs about living, not about one sex or another.\" </p> <p>Gender has never been an issue with her. She says that most of her influences have been male (Dylan, Neil Young, Captain Beefheart), because that's what she's drawn to musically, and there's no other woman to whom she aspires, though she admires Marianne Faithfull. She has never come across obstacles that have been insurmountable through being a woman, she says; she just operates from her own gut instinct. When she first emerged on the music scene, she was briefly assumed to be of a feminist inclination, then she caused a stir by posing topless on the cover of NME. \"It wasn't premeditated, and I was quite unprepared for the uproar that it caused. I really hadn't thought that was how people would react.\" </p> <p>Whether this response is naive or disingenuous is hard to say. Surely she's aware of her own sexual presence - it's certainly not something she plays down in either her music or her performances. \"Obviously, I'm aware of that and I love playing with it, and I think that sexuality is a very big part of music and of performing and making images. It would be like denying part of my character not to do it. Music's a very sexual thing. It's much more to do with the physical than the intellectual.\" </p> <p>Not that her songs are about sex. \"They're about emotions that go with love in any form, love of a cat, God, a person, the world, the countryside, anything. Some of that is sexual love. I think all songs are love songs - they're all about love or lack of love.\" She doesn't like to talk about her lyrics in detail because she believes that, once she has released her songs, it is up to the listeners to interpret them. </p> <p>The trouble with such reticence, however, is that you will often be caricatured in terms of your more extreme lyrical moments. From the time of her first album, Harvey was perceived as an angry, macabre eccentric, a witchy \"Dark Lady\", and that image has stuck. \"People like to categorise you,\" she says, \"and it happens to a lot of people. Some of my male friends are always thought of as these dark, macabre, melancholy miseries, and then you meet them and they're the funniest people with great senses of humour. Certainly a lot of my work has looked into the darker side of things, because that's what fascinated me at the time, but I think you do have to see it in context. I've been doing this for 10 years, and my work is miles away now from what it used to be.\" </p> <p>Perhaps in an attempt to escape the confines of the Polly Jean Harvey persona, she has in the past few years experimented with acting, appearing in a few short films, including a musical cameo (as a bunny girl) in Sarah Miles's A Bunny Girl's Tale. She also acted in New York director Hal Hartley's The Book Of Life, a millennial satire. She had met Hartley when he used some of her tracks in his 1994 film Amateur. </p> <p>She found acting both fascinating and \"very difficult\", and, though she's wary of the \"now I'm a pop star I can be an actress/write a novel\" syndrome, she would like to do more acting. In The Book Of Life, she plays the role of a modern-day Mary Magdalene. The Harveys were not a church-going family - \"Quite the opposite: very rarely did we go\" - but while researching the part she became fascinated by Christianity and the Bible . So much so that today she wears a crucifix around her neck. Does she have a religious faith? \"I don't know if I could answer that really yet,\" she says cautiously. \"I have my own beliefs, which I probably won't talk about. It's a very important part of my interest, and I'm aware of religion and its impact on everyone and everything.\" There was a time when she was portrayed as some kind of black magic sorceress, and there has been such darkness in her songs, let alone in her psyche, that you can't help wondering if she believes there are any forces of good at work in the world. \"Yes, I live with hope that things can change and people can change.\" </p> <p>Her music, she says, is \"a place where I can try and give something to others that might help in some way. I make the songs, and I hand them over and then people can make them their own. Music can say a lot of things that words can't express.\" She seems keen to distance herself from the violence that is still present even in some of her new songs. She can't help but respond to what is going on around her, she says: \"As a writer, I think it's one's duty to keep what's going on within your work. It's a personal response to what I hear and read and see.\" </p> <p>Of course, there's more to it than saintly duty and altruism - there's a steely, ambitious side to Harvey as well. There's the Polly Harvey who disbanded the group, known collectively as PJ Harvey, after the first two albums, with the name, of course, reverting to her - they're her songs, it's her career, and that, it seems, is the way she likes it. And with the shrewd and powerful Paul McGuinness (also U2's manager) now in charge of her business, she is well placed for a long and fruitful career. Her main ambition, though, is not, she insists, to sell more records and become more famous, but to improve her writing - both her songwriting and her poetry and prose, with which she has been experimenting lately. She likes the discipline required to write poetry. \"There are a lot more records in me yet, and it takes hard work and dedication. I want to keep doing that as I want to do it, and not be swayed by outside influences.\" </p> <p>She seems a self-sufficient kind of person. She is said to be reclusive, although she insists that it's a \"myth\" that she has neither television nor telephone in her Dorset home. \"No, it's all modern,\" she laughs. \"I don't do email, though. I write letters.\" She has friends in the music business, and others in normal jobs - \"I need both\" - and her recent spell recording in New York was a sociable time. She says she's thinking of moving to San Francisco for a while - \"A friend has a spare room going\" - and maybe spending some time in Russia, too. There have been times when she has been single, and it felt right at the time, she says. \"I don't find it difficult being in my own company, and it doesn't worry me or upset me if I'm not in a relationship.\" And she says that was true even when she was at a low ebb emotionally. </p> <p>Her most high-profile relationship was around three years ago, with the musician Nick Cave. They are like peas in a pod - not only do they look uncannily alike, their music shares the same gotha-billy intensity. It has been said that he was rather more affected by their break-up than she, and that he wrote the moving and rather beautiful album, The Boatman's Call, about her after she ended the relationship. Harvey is not sure if it's all about her, however. \"I think it's about many different loves in his life.\" But he is someone who she \"respects enormously as a songwriter\". Does she ever feel sad that it's over? \"There's a time and a place for everything,\" she says in a measured tone. \"And I look back at that time with Nick as a wonderful time. I only have an enormous amount of respect for him and admiration and love, and it really was a great time in my life.\" </p> <p>She won't say if she's in a relationship at the moment, though some of the lyrics on her new album seem to indicate that there has been someone in her life. She says she's quite idealistic about love, and not very pragmatic when it comes to relationships. \"I'm much more instinctive, and dive in and get messed up.\" She laughs lightly. She's resolutely uncynical about men, though, and, while she doesn't \"gaze out of the window thinking of red roses\", she does think it is an amazing thing. \"I don't think that true, all-encompassing love for another comes along very often. It's a wonderful thing that should be treasured.\" As for the prospect of having a baby, she's sanguine. \"I tend to think that I'll take whatever comes my way, that whatever comes my way will happen or won't happen, and that's the way it'll be.\" </p> <p>She's so focused, so apparently sorted, that it's hard to imagine how she ever wasn't. But, clearly, it is something she has worked at. Being \"together\" has helped her write this album. \"I think this myth that, in order to be creative, you need to be angst-ridden and tormented and probably addicted to something is complete rubbish. I don't buy it at all. I've found being a more balanced person with more clarity has only enhanced my creativity, because I'm able to think straight and take information in and put it out. It makes good headlines - that's what people want, musicians drugging, sexing and drinking themselves to death - but it's a pop star/rock star myth, which is actually stupid.\" Not that she's averse to the odd drink. \"Certainly, it's a nice way to relax, and very enjoyable, but it definitely doesn't help my writing.\" And drugs? \"I've never got into drugs in a big way. I just don't need it.\" And as far as any moral viewpoint on the rights or wrongs of drug-taking, she's keeping schtum. As she does. </p> <p>When she saw Marianne Faithfull perform in New York last summer, Harvey was blown away. \"I've never seen someone with so much poise and grace and absolute control. She held the audience in the palm of her hand without even trying. She had so much charismatic strength, it was astounding.\" But then, only those who have lost control are likely to prize it so highly. So you can't really blame Harvey for her careful, circumspect approach. The rather impassive, controlled way about her probably enhances the PJ mystique and enigma, but, more important for her, it must help to preserve what you'd imagine must be a rather delicate equilibrium. She's an intense creature and, with her guard up and her boundaries firmly in place, she's protected - from herself as much as from anything else. She says she's stronger now than before, and \"I know what my limits are, and what I will and won't do\". There was a time when she was so low, she felt that she wanted to stay there. She describes the feeling as \"all-encompassing. You feel numb and, for a while, you want to feel like that, but then you realise that you don't any more, and by then it's too late, and you have to work really hard to pull yourself out of the mire.\" </p>",
  "Geoffrey Robinson would like us to believe he has done the government a good turn this week. The ruling clique of the New Labour cabinet, he says, has been riven with personal rivalries and political schisms since its inception and was in need of some healing. So he obliged by writing a book, The Unconventional Minister, which detailed the nature of these splits, resurrected old grievances and accused Peter Mandelson, the prime minister's closest ally, of being a conniving mischief-maker who misled the party, the House and the public. <p>Robinson sold it for serialisation to the newspaper most hostile to the Labour party, the Daily Mail , which splashed his story. The rest of the press followed suit. The upshot was that the cabinet duly appeared as a sleazy, bickering, money-grabbing bunch of prima donnas. This coverage, says Robinson, will help not only the prime minister and Mandelson, but contribute to the government's stability and improve its standing in the eyes of the public. Bridges had to be built, so the Labour MP and former minister thought he would knock some down.</p> <p>\"There may be an initial reaction that will say: 'We could have done without that,' \" says Robinson. \"But I think the more mature reflection will be: 'Yes, there was a very important point Geoffrey was trying to make there, and I think we should tackle it.' \"</p> <p>If this sounds disingenuous it is because it is. It seems as though Robinson, the 62-year-old former paymaster general whose \u00a3373,000 loan to Mandelson forced both of them to resign in December 1998, just cannot help it. Every time he has opened his mouth this week in order to sound sincere, something ludicrously insincere pops out. If he says he has \"nothing but the greatest respect for Peter Mandelson\" you know he is about to trash him. When he writes: \"The public hates to see politicians squabbling and punishes divided governments,\" you know he is about to squabble in a way that will divide the government.</p> <p>He says he has not been surprised at the anti-Labour reception the book has got, but will be surprised if Labour does not benefit. \"It was never intended to be a political version of a kiss and tell,\" he says. \"The serious points I've concentrated on only after considerable and careful thought. I wanted it to be constructive, I wanted it to contribute to making the government more effective and I believe that over time it will have that impact.\"</p> <p>The serious and constructive points revealed in the Mail's serialisation include the following: Robinson was \"miffed\" that he had not been invited to Mandelson's housewarming party Mandelson, not him, raised the issue of a loan for his house in Notting Hill at a dinner party and Mandelson \"remains a destabilising influence between the prime minister and his chancellor\". Now Mandelson is back in government, as a minister, while Robinson remains an outcast.</p> <p>To call this revenge would be to make far too great a claim for it. By his own admission he has far more damaging material in the way of personal letters, that he says he will not release. So this is pique at its pettiest. The politics of the playground, only with far bigger stakes. It is an attempt at political assassination by biography which may well backfire. For it bears the hallmarks of the injured van ity of an insider who is now out the conflicted allegiances of a man who has status but craves respect the disingenuousness of a multimillionaire who thinks money makes no difference. If this is serious, you wonder what he would call trivial if it is constructive, you wonder what he would call damaging.</p> <p>It is a contradiction inherent in the very project he himself embarked on - to settle a score in print without appearing bitter in person. \"The two main aims of what I wanted to achieve are first to counteract the impression of me that I was the sort of person who would use money to promote his own career, curry influence even to obtain a job, which seemed to be a certain element of this from the press attacks that came into this equation. I hope people can see a different person from the one they might have imagined. The second, after considerable reflecton, to raise the issue of Mandelson's role in government. From the beginning I realised how talented he is. But he must stop briefing against colleagues.\"</p> <p>The Park Room, at the Grosvenor House hotel, is an unlikely setting for the outpourings of a victim. Its windows look straight out on to Hyde Park, the furniture is plush and a cup of tea costs more than \u00a34. Upstairs single rooms go from \u00a3267 a night. This is where Geoffrey Robinson stays when he is in London. From the eighth floor, with a glorious view of Park Lane, he sits like a benevolent Master of the Universe - sipping champagne while pontificating on the plight of the poor. It is here that he used to hold \"tax and pasta parties\" with Gordon Brown and his advisers, Charlie Whelan and Ed Balls, while elaborating Labour's economic strategy for the 1997 election.</p> <p>Robinson arrives with a limp he incurred in the gym. His friendliness often threatens to break out into charm but is kept in check by his lack of candour. Just when he appears affable, a straight question: \"What should Blair do if Mandelson fails to become a team player?\" meets an evasive answer: \"I don't want to get into that\" and the bonhomie evaporates. Despite many accounts to the contrary, he maintains that Blair did not ask him to sell the New Statesman to Robert Harris and that nobody from Blair's team asked him not to publish his book.</p> <p>His penthouse is just one of many homes. Ask him how many and he will not, or cannot, give a straight answer. \"It depends how you count them I suppose. We have a little hamlet in Italy which has several buildings on it and a house here in the country. Those are our main two residences,\" he says. And the one in Cannes? \"Yes, we do have one flat in Cannes.\" So there is the Orchards, the Lutyens mansion in Godalming, Surrey the Tuscan villa and the bolthole on the Riviera that slipped his mind. The one place he does not have a home is in his own constituency of Coventry North West.</p> <p>Robinson came by this wealth honestly, if, at times, mysteriously. While running British Leyland's Italian car division in Milan he befriended Joska Bourgeois, a wealthy, flamboyant woman who held the Belgian Jaguar franchise. He married a Maltese-born opera singer, Marie Elena, and would later become the chief executive of Jaguar before going on to run his own business. His close relationship with Bourgeois continued. She lent him \u00a35,000 to start a small company called Transfer Technology, later renamed Transtech. By the time he became a treasury minister it was worth pounds 30m. When Bourgeois died in 1994, she left him pounds 9m and had already set up an offshore trust fund for his family in Guernsey called Orion. While there is no shortage of rumours about the reson for her generosity, nobody knows for sure and Robinson will not say.</p> <p>His wealth left him well connected. He shares a health club with Gordon Brown and Michael Barrymore, and shared a lawyer and a business with the late media tycoon, Robert Maxwell. In 1994, he acquired the New Statesman magazine. Add this to his political career and you have a heady mix. A man who cannot possibly locate the blurry line where financial influence stops and political influence begins because he lives his life on both sides at once. He twice loaned the Blair family his home in Tuscany for their summer holidays, gave a huge personal loan to Mandelson and contributed generously to the offices of both Brown and Blair, as well as former Labour leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith.</p> <p>His generosity has left all three points of the troubled triangle of intrigue in government in his debt. It is a position that makes him simultaneously powerful and vulnerable, since it leaves a constant question mark over his access to power. Robinson, though, is one of the few people who sees no conflict of interest in dishing out huge sums of money to his boss and colleagues. \"If what you're saying is that most people would expect some quid pro quo, preferment, being courted or an honour, then all I can tell you is that that's not the way I operate. Everyone I have helped over the years will tell you that Geoffrey does not seek any thing in return for myself or my business or my family.\"</p> <p>A businessman who expects no return on his investment. Since he says it is so and there is no way to disprove it, then let it be so. It does not get rid of the question mark. For how would we know that those to whom he has done good turns say what they say because it is true and not because he has given them money, and they do not wish to appear ungrateful by portraying him in a bad light?</p> <p>When pushed, he will concede what most adults take for granted. When substantial sums of money change hands between friends, the friendship itself changes. \"I suppose that is bound to be true to some extent. The important thing is the extent of the extent. With me, I never refer to any kindness I've done. I certainly don't expect anything back. I just make it clear it was something I was able to do and that's that. That's the end of it.\"</p> <p>The trouble is that it is not the end of it. It is only the beginning. If ever there is an example of how wealth affects friendships then Robinson is it. Were he not in the position to lend the money to Mandelson - or be asked for it - depending on whom you believe, he would still be in government. If New Labour learns something from his experiences, the lesson has been lost on Robinson. He still insists that, if he had his time over, he would still lend Mandelson the money. \"I don't regret it all. He made a good profit on the house, so I don't suppose he does either. When we did it, it was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. Where it went wrong is that he should have declared it when he was a minister or arranged to refinance it, which I'm sure he could have done.\"</p> <p>In the absence of a job or public sympathy, it is down to Robinson to absolve himself. Quite where he gets this confidence from is not clear. He was born in Sheffield in 1938 and raised in Balham, south London, to working-class parents. His mother worked at home his father - a man with taut bootstraps and entrepreneurial flair -started in a furniture shop and ended up mortgaging the family house so he could buy a furniture factory. \"Politics weren't big in the family but we were definitely Labour supporting. By background we were working class - there were no books at home, we weren't encouraged to read but play football in the winter and cricket in the summer. I was the first of the family to go to university.\"</p> <p>Robinson won a scholarship to a grant-maintained school, Emmanuel College. His self-assurance was not diminished by mixing with children from more cultivated backgrounds. \"We were working class culturally but by that time, my father's work was going well and we were comparatively well off. So we had a sense of being better off materially than those living close to us.\"</p> <p>From there, he went to Cambridge to study modern languages, and gained another scholarship to Yale. \"I met Harold Wilson and he encouraged me to come back to the Labour party so I did.\" \"The big captivating force for me was Kennedy,\" he says. \"I hadn't been active in politics at Cambridge but I got very active in the Yale in Mississippi campaign.\" This was in 1963, one of the most dangerous times in the history of the south's most redneck state. A year later, during the Mississippi Freedom Summer, three young men were murdered in cold blood, striking terror in the hearts of civil rights workers and providing the storyline for the film Mississippi Burning. A strange place and a strange time to cut your political teeth. \"Well, some of my friends were involved in it and while I had not been politically active I had always been politically and socially aware.\"</p> <p>But his political career has been patchy. When he came back to Britain he joined the Labour party and soon started working for it as a researcher. In 1976, he was elected as Labour MP for Coventry North West and earned a sufficiently grand reputation among the Bennite left that the late Eric Heffer suggested he should become head of the National Enterprise Board. By the early 80s, he had fallen out with the left and rose through the ranks as a spokesman on science, regional affairs and then trade and industry.</p> <p>But as his wealth in Transtech grew, he lost interest in politics. In 1986, he stood down as a Labour party industry spokesman. \"Nobody was taking us seriously,\" he says. \"I couldn't operate with the people I knew from industry against the background of the policies that we were going to fight the 1987 election on.\" In 1988 and 1989, he made no speeches in the House at all. In 1989 he came close to being deselected by his local party - hanging on with just 51% of the vote.</p> <p>Given his low profile, his rehabilitation within the party during the 90s was quite miraculous. Until the mid 90s, he was listed by Labour whips as being one of the two most difficult MPs to find to vote against the Tories. But by the end of 1996 he was back as the acceptable face of New Labour by 1997 he was on the front bench.</p> <p>It is then that the various strands of his past, that had previously been of little interest to anyone, started to unravel. Questions arose over his relationship to Maxwell and the pillaged pension funds over the offshore trust, sitting pretty in a tax haven, while Robinson oversaw a reduction in the amount that most people could save tax-free through ISAs the accusation of fraudulent applications for department of trade and industry grants for Transtech. He was forced to apologise to the House by the Commons select committee on standards and priveleges for failing to register his interest in a company he created in 1996. The apology was five sentences long and took only 54 seconds. The next day, the Labour- supporting Express ran a front- page picture of him with the headline \"Has he no shame?\"</p> <p>While he had done nothing illegal, he was becoming an embarrassment to a party which had promised that the Tory years of sleaze would be replaced by an administration that was \"purer than pure\". Blair wanted him to resign but then relented \"out of deference to Gordon and me,\" says Robinson. \"Anyone else would have been out on their ear.\"</p> <p>Moreover, Robinson showed not only no shame, but no remorse either. \"These were acts of omission not commission,\" he says. \"There was no hidden agenda or money in brown envelopes or anything of that kind. The speech was short because there was nothing more to say because there was nothing more to apologise for.\"</p> <p>Then came the loan, the resignations, the bitterness and now the authored recrimination which says Robinson has done nothing wrong and Mandelson has. But Robinson got the blame and Mandelson didn't. The truth of the matter somehow seems less striking than the depths to which it has all sunk.</p>",
  "<p>This year's choice is positively inspiring. There's something for everyone: from a chic sporty look to technical hard-core gear and stylish performance clothing that doesn't cost the earth. </p> <p>Not only are the prices the best they have been in five years, but the shapes and colours are flattering with a lot of gear that is quite wearable on the high street. </p> <p>If you've skipped a ski season or two, you will notice the revolution in performance clothing. Clothes designed for maximum warmth used to be big and bulky, but now with waterproof and breathable fabrics the latest designs are much lighter. A new fabric that you are bound to see more of is Gore-Tex XCR (Xtra Comfort Rating) which eliminates the need for a liner and is 25% more breathable than standard Gore-Tex. (see Get your kit Out, page 21.) </p> <p>Look out for Outlast, an acrylic fibre lining that controls your body temperature by storing and releasing heat for when you need it. It works best the closer it is to your body and is used in underwear, socks, gloves and jackets. </p> <p>Gone are the days of cotton or wool long-johns that either itch or never dry out. Now you need layers with good wicking qualities, which means materials made of microfibres that work by transporting moisture away from the skin. Look for Patagonia's men's silkweight capilene boxers and Odlo's quick drying women's vests, bras and knickers. </p> <p>For the ultimate glam ski-suit, Killy Sport uses the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of stretch fabrics that combine winter warmth and high-street fashion. </p> <p>Another company new to the UK market is Kjus, with some excellent technical ski-wear at the top end of the market. Jackets feature the Outlast temperature- regulating liner. French label Eider has some stylish technical gear for men and women. Best value is a three-in-one ladies jacket for \u00a3199. </p> <p>At the lower end of the market, a Columbia ladies three-in-one jacket costs \u00a3125 while Quiksilver's ladies long jacket complete with waterproof liner is \u00a395. </p> <p><strong>Take a short cut to have more fun</strong></p> <p>A few years ago, ski equipment was markedly more expensive in the UK than in continental Europe. Nowadays, there is little difference in price across the European Union, so it is worth buying before you go to the slopes. </p> <p> The current trend for shorter race skis has filtered through to all recreational models. No casual, two-weeks-a-year skiers should feel too \"macho\" to step down 20cm or 30cm from the lengths they were used to on their old \"straight\" skis. For any given length, carving skis have a greater actual edge length and surface area, so they are more stable in the turn and provide greater flotation in powder. </p> <p>Atomic has just brought in an excellent new Giant Slalom ski with a tight radius of 22m, the <strong> BetaRace 10.22</strong> (\u00a3389). Other companies, such as Salomon and Head, have also increased the sidecuts of their GS models, the Salomon <strong> Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V</strong> (\u00a3400), and the <strong> Head Cyber Worldcup Ti</strong> (\u00a3370). </p> <p>It was all change for slalom skis last season. The trailblazers were the Rossignol <strong> 9S Pro 9.9</strong> , and the Salomon <strong> Superaxe Equipe</strong> . This year's versions are the Rossignol <strong> T-Power 9S Plate</strong> (\u00a3400) and the Salomon <strong> Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V</strong> (\u00a3400). All manufacturers are producing short slalom skis, and most have discontinued their old, \"straight\" skis. </p> <p>On-piste skis are also getting shorter and curvier. It is now acceptable even for experts to use skis that are about the same length as their own height. </p> <p>Rossignol has introduced a whole new range, its T-Power models, designed to be skied 20-25cm shorter than their other models. The range includes the <strong> T-Power Viper</strong> (\u00a3330), <strong> T-Power Cobra</strong> (\u00a3220), and a special women's model, the <strong> T-Power Saphir</strong> (\u00a3220). </p> <p>Salomon has a new ski intended to make life easier for beginners and early intermediates: the <strong> Verse 9</strong> (\u00a3240) - the bindings are mounted further forward than usual to make turning easier for skiers with poor technique. </p> <p>It's important to remember that you won't perform any better by buying a ski above your level of ability. If anything, this will cause your skiing to deteriorate, as the skis will be too stiff for you - you will not be able to apply enough edging pressure for them to function to optimum effect. </p> <p>Free-ride skis, with the wider waists but still shapely sidecuts, is now well-established with the public. They are designed to make off-piste skiing as easy as possible, without compromising performance on firm pistes. The best-known is the Salomon <strong> X-Scream Series</strong> (\u00a3390), now entering its fourth season. But Salomon also has two new free-ride models, the <strong> Scream 10 Pilot</strong> (\u00a3570) and the <strong> Scream 8 Pilot</strong> (\u00a3430) - these prices include bindings. </p> <p>K2 also has a new free-ride range, the MOD series, with a secondary core running like a rib along the entire length of the top surface, designed to give you a smoother ride. </p> <p>There are more ultra-wide free-ride skis on offer. Established models such as the Rossignol <strong> Bandit XX</strong> (\u00a3300), the Dynastar <strong> 4x4 Big </strong> (\u00a3350) and the <strong> K2 AK Launcher</strong> (\u00a3349) have been joined by Head's <strong> Monster Cross</strong> (\u00a3330), Salomon's <strong> AK Rocket</strong> (\u00a3430), Fischer's <strong> Alltrax Big Stix</strong> (\u00a3300) and Nordica's <strong> W9.1FF </strong> (\u00a3320). Volkl's <strong> Vertigo G41 Pro</strong> (\u00a3370) is slightly wider than last year's G40 Pro. They're all a bit of a handful on a firm piste, but they can take a lot of the work out of skiing powder for experts and most confident intermediates, although some models need a certain amount of speed to function at their best. </p> <p>Skis that bend upwards at both ends, so you can ski backwards, have been around since the early days of freestyle in the 1970s. But the \"New School\" movement of aerial tricks has given them a fresh boost, and Salomon's <strong> Teneighty</strong> (\u00a3300) were a hit when launched last season. Thousands of \"normal\" skiers found they could enjoy skiing on them, and the wide profile, originally designed for solid landings, also helped skiers stay near the surface in deep snow. </p> <p>Now, every company has a twintip, allowing a wide range of skiers to look trendy and have a ski that is easy to manoeuvre with. Pick of the bunch is the Rossignol <strong> Pow'air</strong> (\u00a3230), the K2 <strong> Enemy </strong> (\u00a3339), and the Dynastar <strong> Concept </strong> (\u00a3200). New are Nordica's <strong> Z-TT</strong> (\u00a3210), Atomic's <strong> Beta Free Zone Bump</strong> (\u00a3270), Fischer's <strong> Unlimited</strong> (\u00a3250), and Head's <strong> Air Head</strong> (\u00a3240). </p> <p> Salomon's new Pilot system is probably the biggest innovation in fitting bindings to skis since the demise of the old leather straps. Instead of screws drilled downwards into the ski, transverse bolts through the core of the ski hold the bindings on, via arches that curve down over the sidewalls. As well as making binding-mounting much eas ier, they allow the ski to flex freely along its whole length, eliminating the \"flat spot\" that is often created underneath the boot. </p> <p>It's important to take your time when buying boots. At the very least, you should wear them at home for a couple of hours before taking them abroad. If they become uncomfortable at this stage, you may have the option of a refund or exchange, if they are not dirty or scuffed. </p> <p>If possible, test the comfort of the boots with actual skiing movements; a short session on a \"ski simulator\", such as the Metro Ski or the Realli Ski, may give you an idea of how they feel without damaging or soiling the boot. </p> <p>It's even more important for boots than for skis that you buy a model with the right stiffness of flex for your ability. The better the skier, the stiffer the boot required. </p> <p>Many models offer \"thermofit\" systems, where the inner boot is heated for about five minutes on a hot air blower. When you put the boot on, it moulds itself to your foot and maintains its shape after cooling. A custom-made insole may also help with the fit. </p> <p>Less-experienced skiers may want a boot with a \"walk mode\" - this is a catch that allows the upper boot to flex backwards, making walking easier. But it's important to switch the catch back to \"ski mode\" before hitting the slopes. Head's Auto Ski/Walk System does this for you automatically, and is available on all models up to the <strong> Head Cyber</strong> <strong> C9.5 </strong> (\u00a3180). </p> <p>Nordica has changed the shape of the \"Exopower\" frame of stiffer plastic in their top-performance boots to maximise the transmission of forces. They've called their new design the \"Exopower II\", and it features in all their boots from the <strong> Wave 5.1</strong> (\u00a3160) up to the <strong> K9.1</strong> (\u00a3250). </p> <p>Salomon has a new range of boots, the X-Waves, which draw on design features of their racing boots but are more forgiving in fit and flex. Prices range from \u00a3200 for the <strong> X-Wave 8.0</strong> , to \u00a3240 for the <strong> X-Wave 10.0</strong> . The new Salomon <strong> Teneighty Pro Model</strong> (\u00a3250) is made of translucent plastic, and aimed at the young \"New School Free-ride\" market. </p> <p>Rossignol continues with its proven \"Cockpit\" system, a frame of stiffer plastic. This is moulded close to the foot for heightened edge control in its high-performance models, like the <strong> Freeride XX</strong> (\u00a3220), and mounted on the outside of the boot for greater comfort in its intermediate models, such as the <strong> Salto GTX</strong> (\u00a3170). </p> <p> <strong> Where to buy</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Snow+Rock</strong> nationwide and mail order 0845 100 1000, </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.snowandrock.com\">www.snowandrock.com </a> </p> <p> <strong>Lillywhites</strong> 020-7915 4000 </p> <p><strong> Ski 47</strong> three stores in London 020-7384 1979 </p> <p><strong> Blacks</strong> nationwide and mail order 0191 518 2002 </p> <p><strong> Ellis Brigham </strong> nationwide and mail order 0161-834 5555, <a href=\"http://www.ellis-brigham.com\">www.ellis-brigham.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Trekkitt Mountain Sports </strong> 01600 715777</p>",
  "<p>Unlimited internet access for a fixed fee is the holy grail for most people who surf the web. This week the Guardian revealed that BT plans to go part of the way. </p> <p>The company confirmed it will extend its Together package on December 1 to include three unlimited local evening and weekend schemes. BT Surf Together will offer unlimited internet access and metered talk time for \u00a314.99, while a combined internet and voice package for local evening and weekend calls, going under the name BT Talk and Surf Together, will cost \u00a317.99. BT Talk Together, an unmetered voice package will cost \u00a314.99, capping monthly local calls at \u00a35 above the new standard line rental of \u00a39.99. </p> <p>Surftime, the company's current unlimited internet package, has been partially killed off. The unmetered anytime scheme that costs \u00a319.99 survives. </p> <p>When the plan goes ahead the company is likely to be deluged with demands to switch because many similar fixed-cost schemes will be expensive by comparison. </p> <p>At the beginning of the year promises were made by some of the biggest internet service providers (ISPs) that unlimited internet access was here to stay, and for free. AltaVista made the biggest noise about its free service and suffered the biggest humiliation when it couldn't handle the massive demand. Other providers like WorldOnline suffered similar humiliation. We were marched to the top of the hill and in a matter of weeks marched back down again. </p> <p>Tanya Kreisky, editor of Internet magazine, says there have been rumours circulating for months that BT would take this kind of step and put the whole unmetered market back on track. \"The company has generated \u00a37bn from internet calls, which it never expected to make. It needed to do something like this. It is a little bit over the odds compared to pricing in the US, but BT is getting there.\" </p> <p>Off-peak unlimited access packages from the likes of Freeserve will look weak compared to the rival from BT, which has the added benefit of allowing customers to adopt any ISP, she says. </p> <p>A quick flick through the specialist internet press reveals plenty of letters complaining about Freeserve's unlimited package, which costs \u00a310 on top of a BT line rental of \u00a39.99. Many can't get on the net and those that do often get thrown off. </p> <p>The BT deal appears to split internet users into three clear camps. There is the light user , and to people who want so little from the system unmetered access is like driving a people carrier to the newsagents. </p> <p>Then there are the evening and weekend heavy users. The phrase heavy user might conjure up images of some kind of addict, but we are talking about average families with mum and dad using the net to buy plane tickets or check their bank account and children researching school work or playing games. Lastly there is the all-round heavy user, the complete addict who wants 24/7 access. </p> <p>Many readers who contacted Jobs &amp; Money after last week's article were happy with the internet access offered by their phone company. They often used a third-party phone provider like OneTel, Euphony, Atlantic Telecom or Eurobell for the the cuts in call charges they offer over BT rates. The internet services they run on top were generally considered sound. </p> <p>But for the light user a package like that offered by WorldOnline would do the trick. For an extra \u00a32.99 its Freedom Lite package gets you free calls at weekends and evenings and 1p per minute at other times. The trouble is that customers must switch to LocalTel for the phone line as well as WorldOnline as ISP. Some people solve the problem by simply putting an extra phone line for the net and keep an existing line with BT or their cable company. </p> <p>The package also works for people who want to use the system in the evening and weekend. But heavy users are likely to be on the BT Together line rental of \u00a311.99 rather than the standard rate, to be \u00a39.99. They might want a choice of ISPs and for the sake of \u00a33 a customer might want to stick with BT. Free ISPs that are rated highly to go with a BT connection include Claranet.co.uk and Redhotant.com. </p> <p>Internet users who want access all week should look at America Online (AOL). It has an unlimited package costing \u00a314.99 in addition to a BT line rental. It's quite a big difference in cash terms with the \u00a317.99 all-in offer of BT Surf and Talk Together - about \u00a37 - but the service is reliable and robust. </p> <p>Cable users can opt for Telewest's Surfunlimited, which claims to be the UK's first fixed-fee unmetered internet access service and costs \u00a310 month plus a \u00a39 rental. NTL World is one of the last free unmetered access packages and can ride on BT lines. </p> <p><strong>High-speed cable comes - but at a snail's pace</strong></p> <p>It must be 20 years since Tomorrow's World presenter Raymond Baxter, or was it Judith Hahn, cut open a fibre optic cable and declared the digital age was upon us . Fibre optic cables have been in use for some time, but only now are we being promised the superfast telecom services heralded so long ago. </p> <p>BT is slowly offering customers the chance of buying ADSL (Advanced Digital Subscriber Line). It is a way of sending digital messages down copper wires, removing the need to replace all domestic phone lines. It can reach speeds up to 10 times greater than a 56K modem, though the company only guarantees to double the speed. </p> <p>Openworld is the BT ADSL package and costs \u00a339 per month for unmetered access and \u00a3120 to install. It can cut download times dramatically, though it is not yet compatible with Apple computers. You can buy the service from ISPs like Freeserve and Claranet; the cost is the same. </p> <p>The cable companies are also in the game. Telewest has Blueyonder, a high-speed cable internet service that costs about \u00a3150 to install and a fixed fee of \u00a333 month. NTL also has a superfast cable modem service. </p> <p>Cable modems are credited with being faster than ADSL, so when the cable companies eventually get their act together its customers could be ahead on the net.</p>",
  "<p><strong> October 21</strong></p> <p><strong> HD Thoreau, 1857</strong></p> <p> Is not the poet bound to write his own biography? Is there any other work for him but a good journal? We do not wish to know how his imaginary hero, but how he, the actual hero, lived from day to day. </p> <p><strong> William Allingham, 1880</strong></p> <p> Looking at the chimney-piece, Tennyson said; 'When I began to read Italian, I wrote down every word that puzzled me on the sides and front of the chimney-piece where I lodged - painted white - and made a kind of dictionary for myself. I went away for two or three days and when I came back it was all washed off. \"Thought it was dirt,\" the woman said. Worse than that - when I was twenty-two I wrote a beautiful poem on Poland, hundreds of lines long, and the housemaid lit the fire with it. I never could recover it.' </p> <p> <strong> Dawn Powell, 1941</strong></p> <p> The gray busy rainy sky I love, and would like to be out under. But weather, sky, night, sun, wind, rain, or friends are forbidden when there is not money. The invitation of a morning must be ignored for it is a reminder that money must be made - therefore work must be attempted. Actually, there is the empty purse too - a walk, an impulse to use a phone, a bus, buy a newspaper, and these are impossible. I never see autumn anymore without the feeling that I have missed summer - out of doors so forbidden to the poor and the desperate; for us, there is no time, no sun, no daylight, but the endless crouching over a typewriter, trying to keep it from its own will, forcing it in a dozen suggested paths to fortune or at least security. </p> <p><strong> JR Ackerley, 1948</strong></p> <p>What should I do if I came upon a murder, I sometimes ask myself as Queenie [his dog] and I push our way through the vast tangles of bracken where few other people walk? The common is a likely place for murder, as it is for suicide - the angry lustful man who finds he is not, after all, to be granted the sexual relief that his pick-up has led him to expect. What should I do, I ask myself, if I suddenly smelt something nasty - as I often do - and pushing along came upon a strangled woman? I wouldn't do anything, unless I covered it up with leaves to give the murderer a better chance of escape. I certainly wouldn't report it. I have harboured thoughts of murder myself in my life; I could never help to denounce or catch anyone else. </p> <p> <strong> Andy Warhol, 1980</strong></p> <p> I ran into a boy whose job is to go shopping for John and Yoko, to buy them clothes and things. I asked him if they'd ever made him bring anything back and he said just once. I asked him if they ever wore any of the clothes they bought since they don't go out, and he said, \"They're going to make a comeback. They've been wearing them to the studio.\" Oh, and the best thing he said was that when he started to work for them he had to sign a paper that said, \"I will not write a book about John Lennon and/or Yoko One. \" Isn't that great? He said he loves his job. I should find somebody to help me shop - show me where all the good new things are. </p> <p><strong> October 20</strong></p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Gide,1929</strong></p> <p> There are certain days on which one feels oneself particularly wide of the mark; behindhand; in debt; showing a deficit. Today I see nothing but deficiencies everywhere; what I lack; where I fell short ...Take refuge in sleep.</p> <p> <strong>Virginia Woolf, 1939</strong> </p> <p> The most - what? - impressive, no, that's not it - sight in London on Friday was the queue, mostly children with suitcases, outside Warren Street tube. This was about 11.30 We thought they were evacuees waiting for a bus. But there they were, in a much longer line, with women, men, more bags, blankets, sitting still at 3. Lining up for the shelter in the night's raid - which came of course. Thus, if they left the tube at 6 (a bad raid on Thursday) they were back again at 11. So to Tavistock Square. With a sigh of relief saw a heap of ruins. Three houses, I should say, gone. Basement all rubble. Only relics an old basket chair ( bought in Fitzroy Square days) and Penman's board To Let. Otherwise bricks and wood splinters. One glass door in the next house hanging. I could just see a piece of my studio wall standing: otherwise rubble where I wrote so many books. </p> <p>Open air where we sat so many nights, gave so many parties. The hotel not touched. So to Meck [Mecklenburgh Square]. All again. Litter, glass, black soft dust, plaster powder. Miss T, and Miss E. in trousers, overalls and turbans, sweeping. I noted the flutter of Miss T.'s hands: the same as Miss Perkins' Of course friendly and hospitable in the extreme. Jaunty jerky talk. Repetitions. So sorry we hadn't had her card ... to save you the shock. It's awful ... Upstairs she propped a leaning bookcase for us. Books all over dining room floor. In my sitting room glass all over Mrs. Hunter's cabinet - and so on. Only the drawing room with windows almost whole. A wind blowing though. I began to hunt out diaries</p> <p><strong>Norman Lewis, 1945</strong></p> <p> A narrow escape today while motor-cycling along the Via Partenope. I was riding towards the Castel Nuovo, through an area badly damaged by bombing, with the sea on the right and the semi-derelict buildings on the left, when I noticed a sudden change ahead from blue sky, sunshine and shadow, to a great opaque whiteness, shutting off the view of the port. The effect was one of a whole district blotted out by a pall of the white smoke sometimes spread from the chimneys of a factory producing lime. </p> <p> On turning a bend, I came upon an apocalyptic scene. A number of buildings including a bank had been pulverized by a terrific explosion that had clearly just taken place. Bodies were scattered all over the street, but here and there among them stood the living as motionless as statues, and all coated in thick white dust. What engraved this scene on the mind and the imagination was that nothing moved, and that the silence was total. Dust drifted down from the sky like a most delicate snowfall. A woman stood like Lot's wife turned to salt beside a cart drawn by two mules. One mule lay apparently dead, the other stood quietly at its side, without so much as twitching an ear. Nearby two men lay in the positions of bodies overcome by the ash at Pompeii, and a third, who had probably been in their company, stood swaying very slightly, his eyes shut. I spoke to him, but he did not reply. There was no blood to be seen anywhere.</p> <p> This turned out to be one of a series of explosions produced by delayed-action explosive devices constructed by the Germans shortly before their departure, in each case from several hundred mines buried under principal buildings. My friend White's visit to the Central Post Office at about the time I was motor-cycling along the Via Partenope nearly involved him in disaster. He had gone there to discuss the reorganization of the postal services and - I suspect - methods of censorship, and about ten minutes after he left the building blew up, killing heaven knows how many passers-by. A senseless massacre perpetrated on the Italian civil population. </p> <p> <strong>Andy Warhol, 1985</strong></p> <p> It's the fortieth anniversary of the UN and I think Mrs Marcos is in town. It's getting so scary in the Philippines. Some papers say the Marcoses are buying up everything in the US, but that could not be true, the papers can lie. Our government must want them out, though. Like the US must have wanted the Shah to fall. But let's see, did we want to lose Vietnam? No, but after everything that's in the papers this week, I get the Kennedys were just too busy having an affair with Marilyn to worry about Vietnam. </p> <p> <strong> October 19 </strong></p> <p><strong> Florence Farmborough, 1917</strong></p> <p> I saw one of our young doctors dressing a wound before the dirt and grime around it had been washed off. I gave way to my wrath and told him that he was asking for serious trouble if he had dressed the wound before first cleansing it. He rudely told me to mind my own business; I told him that it was my business to see that our soldiers' wounds were cleaned before bandaging. We exchanged many angry resentful words. But I knew that I was right; he knew that he was wrong. But he was a doctor! I was only a Sister!</p> <p> I worked it out before I went to sleep. I knew that I was growing coarse, bad-humoured and fault-finding. At first, I ascribed it to the pressure of warfare, the many hardships and humiliations, the conditions of our everyday life at the Front, when for days we could not undress, or even have a good wash. I decided that there were, indeed, good reasons for my bad temper; yet I began to feel ashamed of myself. Before I became a Red Cross nurse, I had been fully aware that there would be many exasperating moments, but I had been certain that I would overcome them - even welcome them in order to prove the strength of my will. I would often repeat those words of Goethe: 'Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille und ein Charakter im Strom der Welt'. ['Talent is developed in tranquillity, but character is moulded in the tumult of the world.'] I had wanted my character to be strengthened and to come through, as victor, in the struggle. But recently there had been times when the knowledge that I was rude and ill-tempered did not even bother me.</p> <p> Some of our Sisters and Brothers were not noted for their self-control and when they began to throw nasty, biting words at each other, I would tell myself: 'It is lack of education,' or 'It is the Russian temperament.' And now, I am doing the same thing! And I am English! We English have a reputation here for having our feelings well under control. I really am ashamed of myself and must take myself in hand. </p> <p><strong>Sir Hugh Casson, 1980</strong></p> <p> [Goa]<br> I am approached by a smart, young, white-clad figure, who trudges from a distance across the sands like a survivor from some disastrous desert expedition. He is carrying two bottles. He suggests I need a massage. 'Ah', he says, 'you very, very old man ... very tired ... very much work' ... He pinches my leg and my upper arm ...'very, very old', he says, shaking his head. I am nettled by this, and, refusing his attentions, walk off into the surf squaring my shoulders. But he has the last laugh as a comber knocks me off my feet. I remember a previous encounter with an itinerant masseur in Agra. When I refused his administrations, he offered, in sequence, his daughter or a copy of The Reader's Digest.</p> <p> <strong> October 18</strong></p> <p><strong>John Wesley, 1749</strong></p> <p> I rode, at the desire of John Bennet, to Rochdale, in Lancashire. As soon as ever we entered the town, we found the streets lined on both sides with multitudes of people, shouting, cursing, blaspheming, and gnashing upon us with their teeth. Perceiving it would not be practicable to preach abroad, I went into a large room, open to the street, and called aloud, 'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts.' The word of God prevailed over the fierceness of man. None opposed or interrupted; and there was a very remarkable change in the behaviour of the people, as we afterwards went through the town.</p> <p> <strong> Rev. Francis Kilvert, 1870</strong> </p> <p>Old James Jones was breaking stones below Pentwyn. He told me how he had once cured his deafness for a time by pouring hot eel oil into his ear, and again by sticking into the ear an 'ellern' (elder) twig, and wearing it there night and day. The effect of the eel oil at first was, he said, to make his head and brains feel full of crawling creatures. </p> <p> <strong>Dearman Birchall, 1873</strong> </p> <p> I visited the county Prison alone and authorized the Governor to introduce gas into the carpenter's and brush shops, the expense not to exceed 10/-, the cost of necessary piping, and the work to be done by the prisoners; also purchase of new carpet for the bedroom of new laundry maid which has been papered and painted since the death of Miss Higgs from typhoid fever. I saw Butt who has a cold, and Cole who has nearly murdered his wife with a hot poker. </p> <p> <strong> Harold Nicolson, 1930</strong></p> <p> Feeling very depressed with life. Can't make out whether it is mere middle-aged depression or whether it is really that I loath journalism so much that it covers all my days with a dark cloud of shame. I feel that I have no time to add to my reputation by doing serious work and that my silly work day by day diminishes the reputation I have already acquired. I have become 'famous' as a radio comedian, and shall never be able to live down the impression thus acquired. In fact I feel a pretty feeble creature, just a soppy superficial humourist. I would give my soul to leave the Standard but I daren't risk it because of the money. Middle-age for a hedonist like myself is distressing in any case, but with most people it coincides with an increase of power and income. With me I have lost all serious employment, sacrificed my hopes of power, and am up against the anxiety of having not one penny in the world beyond what I earn. Is it this that makes me so perpetually unhappy? I have never been unhappy like this before. Till this year I have, except in rare periods of some definite worry or misery, woken each morning with the zest of being alive. Today each morning comes to me as a renewal of humiliation. It may be that I am overworked. I certainly mind things more than I should if my nerves were in order. I loathe getting fat for instance, and yet at my age, I can't expect to be young. Perhaps all this is good for me. Life has been an easy thing for me till this year 1930. And yet I shouldn't mind if I were in a position to fight my difficulties with what is best in me. What depresses me is that I can only live by exposing what is worst in me to the public gaze. I feel a fake: and it is that which humiliates and saddens me. </p> <p> <strong>James Lees-Milne, 1973</strong></p> <p> Wishing to buy another odd pair of trousers I went to what used to be called The Trouser Shop next to the Cafe Royal in Regent Street. The entrance looked different. A young man dressed in velvet, although in the middle of the day, approached me. Hesitantly I asked if this establishment still sold trousers. His greeting was 'Hullo!' which took me aback. I replied 'Hullo!' Then asked if he had any trousers that would suit me. With bland surprise he said regretfully, 'We can only cater for clients with a waist of less than 36,' and gave me a snide look. 'Besides, all our legs are much flared.' Oh dear, I found myself apologizing for being so old and untrendy. But on reflection, why the hell should a man apologize for no longer being young, as though he was thereby an inferior being? <br><strong> October 17</strong></p> <p><strong> John Evelyn, 1660</strong> </p> <p>This day were executed those murderous Traytors at Charing-Crosse, in sight of the place where they put to death their natural Prince, and in the Presence of the King his sonn, whom they also sought to kill: take[n] in the trap they laied for others: The Traytors executed were Scot, Scroope, Cook, Jones.

There were uncommon thunder and lightning here last Thursday; but nothing to that which were there on Friday night. About ten the storm was just over the town; and both the bursts of thunder and lightning, or rather sheets of flame, were without intermission. Those that were asleep in the town were waked, and many thought the day of judgement was come. Men, women, and children, flocked out of their houses, and kneeled down in the streets. With the flames, the grace of God came down also in a manner never known before; and as the impression was general, so it was lasting: It did not pass away with the storm; but the spirit of seriousness, with that of grace and supplication, continued... </p> <p>\u0095 The Assassin's Cloak will be published by <a href=\"http://www.canongate.net\" target=\"_NEW\">Canongate</a> on November 23, priced \u00a325</p>",
  "As GPs set aside thousands of doses of Medeva oral polio vaccine, the government was battling once more to maintain confidence in its immunisation programmes. <p>The latest in a series of fiascos leaves health officials conceding that voluntary measures agreed with the drug industry failed to keep bovine material from BSE-infected Britain out of vaccines. This follows controversy over the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab, linked to autism and Chrohn's disease, and the new meningitis C vaccine. </p> <p>Once again the government is having to stress how its programmes keep potentially lethal disases at bay, and to put this bove the risk, apparently minimal, of infecting children with other killers. </p> <p>The Medeva case is slightly different however. The government has in recent months kept saying the bovine materials in its vaccines were sourced from BSE-free countries. It had to, after it emerged from the BSE inquiry that guidelines issued as long ago as 1989 telling drug companies to change their supplies, had in fact taken up to four years to work through. Stocks of vaccines for MMR, diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough had to stay in use to ensure programmes could continue until replacements were ready. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the guidelines only ever referred to injected vaccines until new guidlines emanated from the EU last year and got British approval in April. Next year, for the first time they will have the force of law. But the government maintains the spirit of the guidelines was meant to apply to all vaccines. </p> <p>Yesterday's revelations were hugely embarrassing for the health department and its medicines control agency. It appears three times to have relied on assurances from Medeva, and Medeva claimed to have relied on assurances from Wellcome from whom it bought part of its product in 1991. Foetal calf serum helps \"grow\" strains of polio virus, which helps produce antibodies in those vaccinated to fight the disease itself. Polio vaccine involves three strains. Work on one in both the Wellcome and Medeva product, involving a British source, seems to have been under way in 1985, the year before BSE was formally identified in herds, and four years before it actually went into commercial use. No one yesterday could say how many doses were administered between 1989 and 1991. </p> <p>But Medeva's product involved blending two strains from non-British sources and has been administered in 35m doses. It said six batches of a third strain manufactured by Wellcome had come from BSE-free herds in New Zealand but a seventh had come from a controlled British herd. </p> <p>The government yesterday insisted that serum from BSE-infected cows did not display infectivity and that the manufacturing process would remove unwanted protein. The risk of tranferring BSE infectivity into humans was therefore \"incalculably small\". </p> <p>Experiments on mice innoculated with infected British cattle serum are thought to have so far shown no evidence that BSE can be transmitted in this way but scientists have long known of the theoretical possibility that it may be. </p> <p>Evidence to the BSE inquiry suggested officials responsible for the control of medicines had been considering such dangers as early as autumn 1987, even though the health department was not officially informed even of the existence of BSE until March 1988. </p> <p>Sir Donald Acheson, then the chief medical officer, was worried, but he was even then concerned about the threat to vaccination programmes. He told the BSE inquiry there were 180 deaths from measles and whooping cough in the 1980s because some babies had not been vaccinated in the wake of other scares. In Febrauary 1989, there were found to be more than 500,000 litres of medicines in stock using British bovine material. </p> <p>The following year it was known that at least three products were still made that way - a skin test for TB, a measles vaccine and a vaccine to prevent diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough. </p> <p>But even last year the identity of the companies was protected by confidentiality clauses in the medicines act. It is understood however the inquiry report next week will give names. It has subsequently emerged there were probably five vaccines that involved British-sourced serum with expiry dates in 1992 or 1993, although the health department could not provide exact dates. </p> <p>Now Celltech, the company which absorbed Medeva, and has just sold the vaccine business, says it acted in good faith and in a manner consistent with its knowledge. It is aggrieved that it told the control agency of the problem but was not even been informed of yesterday's recall notice. </p> <p>The reddest faces will be within government however, and questions will be asked once more about just how independent and efficient the regulatory system truly is.</p>",
  "The government last night faced calls to tighten controls over the medicine industry as it admitted that children were still being given oral polio vaccines using material from British cows 14 years into the BSE crisis. <p>Officials have been forced to recall remaining supplies of the drug as a precautionary measure, while insisting that the risk of catching the human form of BSE through innoculation was \"incalculably small\". </p> <p>An estimated 35m doses of the vaccine produced by Medeva between 1991 and this week have been given to young children, teenagers receiving booster doses and travellers. It accounted for a third of all oral polio vaccine administered. </p> <p>Guidelines to ban the use of bovine material from BSE-affected countries in vaccines have been in place since 1989, three years after BSE was identified. Until last year these were primarily aimed at those injected into people, but the Department of Health said the spirit of the measures was meant to apply to oral treatments as well. There was unlikely to be any legal action against the suppliers because guidelines are not finally turned into law until next year. </p> <p>The health department said assurances by the company had \"proven inaccurate\" but it was vital that parents continued to have their children vaccinated against polio as part of a \u00a34m-a-year national programme to keep at bay a potential killer that has virtually been eliminated in Britain. </p> <p>The news horrified families of the 84 victims of variant CJD, the human form of BSE, because the possibility that vaccines were a cause of the fatal disease in humans has been examined by the BSE inquiry which reports next week. </p> <p>Malcolm Tibbert, chairman of the Human BSE Foundation, said: \"After all these years it still looks as if we have not learned any lessons. It transpires the Department of Health didn't check out these companies to proper standards. It is very worrying.\" </p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, who has been campaigning for the government to give more information on vaccines, said: \"There has been a terrible averting of eyes on anything related to vaccines in the last 11 years. The whole reason seems to be that the vaccination programme must not be undermined. I am happy to accept BSE is a remote risk but [the Department of Health's] response has been to sweep it under the carpet.\" </p> <p>Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer for England, said the impact of the recall was likely to be minimal. \"I know this recall will worry parents but it is important to remember that polio is a potentially lethal disease which we have virtually eliminated from this country.' </p> <p>\"I am advised that the risk of a person contracting vCJD from this oral polio vaccine is incalculably small. Public confidence in medicine safety is paramount. We have to approach this from the precautionary principle, knowing that these important principles have been breached.\" </p> <p>Vaccine production uses foetal calf serum, from pregnant cows, to help grow cells using different polio strains. A vaccine using the British material was put on the market by Wellcome in 1989. But in 1991 it was bought by Medeva, which added two strains of its own to a new product. </p> <p>This became part of the huge Celltech business early this year but was sold on to Powderject Pharmaceuticals this month. Celltech said yesterday it had \"relied on assurances from Wellcome\" that the product came from overseas cattle when it said on three occasions in the 1990s that it did not use British sources. </p> <p>\u0095 Worried patients should contact their GP who will hold records of which brand of vaccine has been given.

But in my thirty-year collection of Press cuttings on a diverse range of subjects, those marked 'England and the English' from British newspapers are twenty times as numerous as any other category.\" </p> <p>Shah died in 1996; but for that, his cuttings file on Englishness would be bursting his shelves. From pop records to political polemics, from television series to reports by charities and dirty flags of St George fluttering from truck cabs, the supposedly unspoken subject of English identity has been raised ever more loudly since. Sometimes, it comes disguised as an assertion or discussion of Britishness: the brief swagger of Cool Britannia, the Runnymede Trust's recent warnings about racial prejudice concealed within the word \"British\". But you can be sure that England, where the great majority of the people and power in these islands - for good or ill - have long resided, is a looming presence. Debates about British multiculturalism tend to mention Bradford more than Bridgend. Blur's big-selling \"Britpop\" songs were about London, not Lothian. </p> <p>Yet ask someone English what their nationality means, and often as not they will still pause and look blank, or mumble something about green fields and cricket. This traditional, rural, pre-immigration definition of Englishness still dominates: for all the current questioning talk about English identity, it is the version all others must compete with. John Major may have been mocked for his sepia speech-making about warm beer and bicycling maids, but people remember what he said. </p> <p>And just as England likes to deny it is interested in itself, so its old-fashioned self-image denies how the English actually live. Most of us reside, or at least work, in big towns and cities. We move along busy grey streets. We hear foreign accents at bus stops. We have never worked in a field. This restless, claustrophobic, relatively cosmopolitan existence has been the lot of the English majority since the industrial revolution two centuries ago, and of Londoners for centuries longer. Visitors from abroad realize it; from Friedrich Engels to French language students wandering open-mouthed in Soho, England has been a place of noise, crowds and a haphazard kind of modernity - not the misty outline of distant hills. </p> <p>Roger Scruton is fleetingly prepared to admit this. \"Foreign visitors in Elizabethan times,\" he writes, \"came away with the impression of a fiery, devious and intemperate people.\" But this is not the sort of discovery his book prefers to make. Instead Scruton, who is a huntsman and Tory philosopher, and runs an austere \"experimental farm\" in the hard, dry soil of northern Wiltshire, has written a defence, of some elegance and sophistication, of the crustiest version of Englishness imaginable. </p> <p>Its cover photograph perfectly establishes his tone. A couple in blurred focus and smart Edwardian clothes stand stiffly on a beach beneath white cliffs. She wears a hat against the milky English sun, there is a wet dog at their feet and a small child playing in the near distance. To Scruton this world, which lasted from late Victorian times until the early 1960s, was the high point of English achievement, a time when his countrymen were \"famous for their stoicism, their decorum, their honesty, their gentleness and their sexual puritanism\". Nowadays, he continues, characteristically cool but regretful, \"those qualities are no longer honoured\". He refers to his country throughout in the past tense. </p> <p>Such sentiments are always around in England - especially during Labour governments. The whiff of conservative partisanship, and the tendency of nostalgics to ignore the violence and instability of much of England's past, often makes their writing easy to dismiss. Scruton, though, is a different prospect. His frame of reference, for a start, includes authors who do not share his politics, such as Linda Colley, the historian of how Britain was constructed, and Tom Nairn, the Scottish prophet of its current dismantling. And Scruton writes with vivid reverence about the culture he sees disappearing, of \"trees wrestling upwards for the light\" in neglected hedges and country churches where \"a peculiar silence had been stored\". He can even be droll: \"Sexual intercourse, Larkin tells us, began in 1963,\" Scruton starts one of the passages of personal memoir here with which he most persuasively makes his argument. \"Certainly it had not begun in 1959 - not in Marlow at least.\" </p> <p>Before his southern English idyll in Marlow, it is a surprise to learn, Scruton grew up in a grimy part of Manchester. His father was a teacher \"occupying the lowest rung\". The family name, rumour had it, came from the illicit seduction of an ancestor who was a servant at Scruton Hall in Yorkshire. Yet the Manchester Scrutons were all thrift and neighbourliness. This enabled the future philosopher to ascend to grammar school and Oxford, in a manner he now considers typical of England at the time. Mentors of infinite patience and knowledge, all male, appear in these pages, instruct the author in manners and high culture, and modestly depart to their bachelor lodgings. </p> <p>This story has some of the moral momentum and intensity of a Victorian novel. Around his grainy memories, Scruton arranges essays about the educational, legal, and geographical structures that bred his favourite sort of Englishness in others. These sections are less successful. Over-familiar assertions of national uniqueness, loosely argued - the unreformed House of Lords, for example, is justified as representing the English countryside, as if it doesn't already have MPs - replace the usual Scruton logic and economy of expression. A brief, unattractive rage rises up in him against unpatriotic intellectuals and illegitimate children who \"litter the country\", undermining the sense of tolerance here, a quality he identifies as a prime English virtue. And the absence of urban England, let alone immigrant England, or the England of pre-eminent innovation in popular culture, begins to remove authority from the pages. When Scruton mourns \"the old improving risks\" his countrymen used to take, you know he has probably never seen a pirate radio station on an east London rooftop. </p> <p>Dennis Hardy understands better that Englishness has always existed in multiple, quarrelling versions. Since at least medieval times, he writes at the start of his careful scholar's volume, \"two oppositional themes have dogged the English character ... the ideal of a benign monarchy and that of a peasant republic.\" His focus is on people of the second inclination, what you might call the anti-Scruton tendency, and their efforts to establish an alternative England during the first half of the 20th century. </p> <p>Interestingly, very few of these socialists, communists and \"hairy-headed banana munchers\", as one cartoon summarized them, put their faith in urban England (although that would change after 1945). The countryside was their laboratory, in particular the Cotswolds and the deep-green southwest, where countless commuting stockbrokers, and Scruton himself, would later live out their own rural dreams. </p> <p>One of these tiny tribes of radicals, microscopically revealed by Hardy, was the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, set up by a 22-year-old pacifist called John Hargrave in August 1920. They went on camps, wore hooded smocks and fancied themselves, at first, a dissenters' version of the Boy Scouts, then later \"the only English national movement\". They advocated state control and redistribution of money; although membership was only in the hundreds, they were keenly watched by Special Branch. </p> <p>Hargrave felt that England had \"lost itself in a meaningless and devastating commercial scramble\". Scruton, by the end of his book, comes to pretty much the same conclusion. His talk of \"spivs\" ruining the City and \"agribusiness\" razing the countryside, of Labour and even the Tories complicit in the conquests of the global market, sounds like a man beginning to slip his political moorings. Perhaps a certain sort of English person, of whatever ideology, eventually ends up on the barricades against international capital.</p>",
  "<p>Friday night and you're all dressed up but too tired to go out on the pull? Don't lose heart, just ask a colleague. Work is the place to make lasting friendships and sometimes even meet our lifetime partner, according to Friendship Works , a new study by career consultancy Sanders and Sidney. </p> <p>A punishing workload - workers in this country work some of the longest hours in Europe - often precludes meeting partners in the usual social settings. And traditional ways of meeting friends and potential partners, such as through relatives, neighbours or the church have broken down, the report says. Instead, it stresses the growing importance of the workplace as a source of community, friendship and personal relationships. </p> <p>And bosses who fear that office romances are taking their workers' minds off the job may be surprised to learn that the report says meaningful relationships in the workplace can boost business productivity and employee loyalty. It goes on to say that firms should not just allow workplace liaisons, but actively encourage them, arranging social activities for staff and helping workers to mix more. </p> <p>Chief executive Frances Cook says: \"Our study found friendships are just as important as pay and benefits in binding us to employers. These days, when employees can have the pick of jobs, firms should be encouraging friendship to attract staff.\" Yet fewer than one in 10 of the employers questioned have a formal policy for encouraging a sense of belonging. </p> <p>The workplace community is a significant factor in our decision to join an organisation and stay with it. It is also an important factor in our personal lives, with seven out of 10 men and nine out of 10 women making lasting friendships that extend beyond the workplace. </p> <p>Just as Lucy Benjamin (Lisa) and Steve McFadden (Phil), who met on the set of BBC soap EastEnders, are stepping out in real life as well as on screen, the report predicts that a quarter of us will meet our partners at work. As more women enter the jobs market and people socialise with colleagues, the office has become the place to meet new people as well as work. And thanks to email, flirting is that much easier. Nor do you need to worry about cheesy chat-up lines as you already have office life in common. </p> <p>There is little doubt that the barriers between work and play are tumbling down. Drinks after a hard day in the office to wash away the stresses and strains are de rigeur. But it is best to only gradually let a workplace or business acquaintanceship become a friendship; even then try to keep it a casual, non-intimate friendship. Be especially careful if you are new at a job or in a novel situation, like a trade show or at a team building conference. Be wary of colleagues who seem overly friendly or pump you for too many intimate details about your personal life. </p> <p>Dave McCracken met his wife through the company social club at a large pharmaceutical firm. Now a management consultant, he has observed two companies who take very different approaches to managing relationships. The first, an e-commerce firm places great emphasis on making everyone feel part of the business. It arranges inter-departmental competitions and social outings. The firm's staff retention rate has shot up, cutting its recruitment and training costs. </p> <p>The second company adopts an ivory tower approach - it is larger and more disjointed and its employees are split over three sites, with very little communication between them. Staff are less motivated and committed. </p> <p> If you don't remember anything else... </p> <p>Office affairs range from innocent flirting to the downright steamy. The ones that can cause the most grief are those involving a boss and a subordinate, or when one or both participants are married. </p> <p>Even if you are both single and at the same level, it may be prudent to check out whether your firm sees such a liaison as dangerous. If so, one of you may have to move to another department - or even to another job.</p>",
  "<p>When I took this job I wasn't sure how long the software would interest me, but the fact that we are working on a project using the very latest technology has meant it's been a fascinating 10 months. Put simply, I am responsible for creating the system that lets viewers of Sky Television's interactive shopping channel actually make purchases from their sofas using the TV's remote control. </p> <p>In many ways it's very similar to designing a website, but the most important difference is that our process is based around the remote control, rather than a mouse and keyboard. Viewers can order everything from pizzas to TVs, play games or use banking services - our basic remit is to make it as easy as possible to use. </p> <p>Once I have been briefed as to the content and size of that particular retailer's service, I'll set about creating the system that allows the viewer to move about the virtual shop and find the product they're after. </p> <p>We use a specially designed computer program that has a template from which we work. It's a case of building the shop up methodically - putting the various blocks of content together and cementing them with lines of coding. It's this computer coding which eventually enables the viewer to interact with the service. I don't get involved in the way it looks, just how it works. </p> <p>The other side of my job comes once the shop has been put together. Every system has to be rigorously tested as we go along. I am one of around 30 service developers and once we've finished creating the shop, we get one of the others to give it a thorough testing. They might make some recommendations on how it can be improved and then it's a case of going back and making those changes. </p> <p>The fact that the UK leads the world in this field just makes the whole thing more exciting. Once a week all the service developers get together to discuss how things are going and share new ideas. We have a great camaraderie and there's no doubt that working with cutting edge technology pulls us all together. The only downside can be the long hours as a project nears completion. </p> <p>I came to this via an MSc in interactive multi-media design at Westminster. I am sure it's the future - the only problem is I don't get a chance to use it at home, because at the moment I'm living in rented accommodation, and don't have access to Sky.</p>",
  "<p>You want either a first or a third. There is no value in anything between. Time spent on a good second is time thrown away. At least, that was the view of Evelyn Waugh in Brideshead Revisited . </p> <p>It can't be helped. However richly individual your circumstances, the class of your degree does say something about you. </p> <p>We all know that a 2:1 means you're bright but not brilliant, and that a 2:2 shows you're dim and diligent, but what about the other two classes of honours degree: the aristocratic first and the disreputable third? How do these rate with employers? </p> <p>A first is of course the glittering prize, and there is none more spangly than a first from Cambridge. However, even this is no longer the ticket to employment nirvana it once was. </p> <p>\"If you get a first it justifiably makes you feel good,\" says Angela Dinham of Cambridge University careers service. \"It makes your tutors and director of study feel good, and an employer will like it. </p> <p>\"It does mean you are more likely to get short-listed for exam-based careers like law or accountancy, and it is very important in academia, where it means you are much more likely to be offered a place on a postgraduate course and to get funding. It is certainly worth having, but for employment, on its own, it's not enough: you also need a rounded profile.\" </p> <p>Outside the exam-taking sectors, a first is now just a bonus. The candidate who has one will get the job if all other things are equal (but of course they never are). </p> <p>The only negative aspect to a first class degree is that its meaning changes as your career progresses. The less impressive your CV the more noteworthy it becomes. If you do well, it just looks like a precursor of your success, but if you don't, employers might start to ask if you are suited to life outside the ivory towers, and in the longer term you may find yourself lumbered with all the respect, cachet, and regard that is attached to being a member of Mensa. But straight out of university, a first is difficult to knock. </p> <p>The other noteworthy honours degree is the third. In the past, this always had a certain disreputable appeal. Indeed there were once rumoured to be City firms which, like Evelyn Waugh's character, only looked at candidates with firsts or thirds and wouldn't touch anything in between. </p> <p>Today, however, getting a third is undoubtedly a problem. A third will disbar you from high-flying careers like the civil service fast-stream, but its effects are not limited to the upper echelons. Many graduate recruiters, and not just those who rely on professional qualifications, will ask for a 2:2 or above, and offers have been withdrawn from applicants who fail to make the grade. Even teachers with a third are paid \u00a3909 less in their first year than their better-qualified colleagues. </p> <p>The one thing that can be said for a third is that it is intriguing. All other honours degrees seem to tell you something about the holder, but a third requires more information. </p> <p>With a third on your CV you could be anything: a wastrel; someone deeply involved in extra-curricular activities; the victim of unfortunate circumstances; or even a genius incapable of conforming to academic restrictions. A third class degree needs explaining, and this is how much of the damage it might do to your prospects can be limited. </p> <p>\"It's not the end of the world,\" says Andrew Whitmore of Manchester University and UMIST careers service, \"but it is essential to compensate in other areas. Companies love candidates who make things happen, so if you can refocus their interest on the skills you have demonstrated in pursuing your wider interests then you can do just as well as better-qualified applicants. Your main difficulty is getting through the initial sift of application forms. </p> <p>\"I advise people in this situation to make a personal approach. Networking, targeting careers fairs, and even simply telephoning can demonstrate that your interpersonal selling skills far outweigh your poor academic performance.\" </p> <p>And if you can't provide any evidence of extra-curricular activities and interpersonal skills? \"The tricky thing to handle is a third and no evidence of compensating activities,\" admits Angela Dinham. </p> <p>In this situation, you're best off looking for a small, idiosyncratic employer who sees disreputable failure as the mark of true character. Such firms probably do still exist, but they are not major graduate recruiters. (Evelyn Waugh, by the way, is dead.)</p>",
  "\u0095 I fear that the anti-GM bandwagon has veered out of control.

  "Broken track, skewed rolling stock and officials arguing about blame made a familiar picture yesterday - but in a railway derailment with a difference. <p>Long-planned shooting of the climax of a biting new film set during British Rail's privatisation went ahead on a railway siding in Yorkshire, airing all the issues currently in the headlines after the Hatfield tragedy. </p> <p>The scenes will be shown next year in Navigators, the latest work of Ken Loach, director of Kes. It tells the story of how a close-knit gang of British Rail track workers is broken up by privatisation. </p> <p>Arrangements to derail the freight cars were already under way at the Doncaster location when the London-Leeds express disaster happened, but the tragedy has given the filming added edge. Between takes of scenes showing different companies' staff disputing the cause of the film's crash on mobile phones, Loach attacked the \"destruction of the culture of the railway\" by the sale of BR to so many competing private firms. </p> <p>\"It is ironic that Railtrack is at last saying the same thing,\" he said. \"The fragmentation of the service and the notion of competition are what have killed the traditional integrity of the railway system. Navigators is about the people whose job was to keep the railway safe, and how their security of employment has been destroyed.\" </p> <p>The film is drawn from the experiences of its scriptwriter Rob Dawber, a former railway signals worker. </p> <p>Navigators is scheduled for TV screening by Channel 4 next year but is also expected to be shown in cinemas.</p>",
  "Anoraks, pens, tablecloths and picnic sets may not seem reasons to change your way of life, but then you're not Roman. Where others see trinkets, Romans see the holy grail: something for nothing. <p>It is an irresistible promise which is persuading thousands to abandon a venerable tradition as much part of the city as scooters and lost tourists. Fare-dodging, an art form passed from generation to generation, is dying. </p> <p>It took them a few decades, but bosses at the municipal transport company, Atac, have found a marketing ploy to make bus and metro passengers insist on paying. </p> <p>A point-collecting game which exchanges used bus tickets for prizes has been a huge hit. Atac is selling an extra 3m tickets per month, with long queues outside the company's headquarters. </p> <p>On buses the atmosphere is noticeably different. It used to be that the honest passenger would punch his or her 45p ticket in one of the little yellow machines on the bus, then observe those who remained ticketless. </p> <p>No fingers were pointed, no denunciations thundered, but the dishonest travellers would sense the watching. The brazen response of some was to smirk, for beating the system - any system - was a legitimate aspiration. </p> <p>More commonly the dishonest would respond by gazing into the middle distance, a composure very seldom broken by an inspector. Some still try it on but their numbers have diminished. </p> <p>The incentive is simple. Romans who collect 600 tickets can exchange them for the top prize: a hi-fi. A bog standard stereo it may be but it has become a fabled object sought by rich and poor. </p> <p>The puzzle is that these prizes are not free, especially for the dishonest. Money saved from 600 dodged fares would easily buy three hi-fis. So where is the attraction? </p> <p>The only answer is the desire to compete, and the ticket scheme is being marketed as a contest. Italy's love affair with television game shows is well documented. Underwhelming prizes deter contestants not one bit. A dropped pin would shatter the silence in bars during televised lottery draws. </p> <p>A neighbouring region has sworn vengeance on Puglia in the south east after it scooped the lottery a suspicious number of times. Video poker machines that flash and spin in almost every bar are notoriously rigged - police regularly charge bar owners with fraud, yet punters can't get enough. </p> <p>A 17-year-old tried to strangle his mother because she refused him money to play on the machines. A doctor attempted suicide after blowing the family savings. A woman used her son's toy gun to hold up a post office in order to pay off debts. </p> <p>On it goes, the quest for something for nothing that can cost everything. </p> <p>The irony is that Romans don't like risk. A more cautious, fretful group you would rarely meet. They insure up to the hilt, yet worries about money, health and security suffuse daily life. Maybe that's the genius of Atac. To punch a ticket is to play a game you are sure to win.</p>",
  "<p>A doctor who bungled the anaesthesia of a boy who died in a dentist's chair and a woman whose caesarean operation turned into a nightmare of pain was found guilty of 17 charges of malpractice yesterday. </p> <p>John Evans-Appiah, 58, is likely to be struck off the medical register on Monday by the General Medical Council after the professional conduct committee found the 17 charges proven. The committee will consider arguments in mitigation from his lawyers. </p> <p>Over three weeks the committee heard shocking evidence concerning individual patients, but the case also raises wider questions about the use of locums in the NHS. </p> <p>Dr Evans-Appiah had had 42 jobs in the NHS since arriving in Britain 23 years ago. The Ghanaian doctor, who trained in the Ukraine, was one of a large number of overseas-trained doctors who are apparently not deemed good enough to be given full registration, but on whom the NHS is heavily reliant. </p> <p>A fatal accident inquiry in Edinburgh into the death of Darren Denholm, 10, who died during what should have been a routine tooth extraction, referred to a \"tribe of wandering locums\". It heard that Dr Evans-Appiah's work was \"dangerous, bizarre and inept\". He was eventually given full registration as a dental anaesthetist in 1997, a year before the boy died. </p> <p>Darren Denholm had been taken to the Peffermill dental surgery in Edinburgh on October 9 1998 by his mother to have a decaying molar taken out. Dr Evans-Appiah was asked to give the boy a general anaesthetic using the drug Halothane, but he failed to sedate him adequately. </p> <p>When the dentist, Hallgeir Pedersen, began to pull the tooth out with forceps, Darren kicked out in agony. </p> <p>Dr Evans-Appiah should have given him more anaesthetic, but did not. Darren's body reacted to the pain and the stress with a natural surge of adrenalin, which gave him a heart attack. </p> <p>The boy was then injected with a local anaesthetic which also contained adrenalin, sealing his fate. </p> <p>Kirsty Thompson, the dental nurse, gave the GMC a graphic account of the tragedy. \"I watched the young boy die in front of my eyes. It was a very traumatic day. There was no one in charge of the situation at all.\" </p> <p>She said she had screamed \"he's fucking green,\" at Dr Evans-Appiah, who appeared dazed. But he just panicked, she told the GMC. She also gave evidence that the anaesthetist had tried to cover up his mistakes. \"He tried to say I had taken a blood pressure reading before the cardiac arrest, but that was not true,\" she said. </p> <p>The Edinburgh inquiry heard that the doctor had failed to attach a blood pressure monitor or a heartbeat detector to check Darren's health during the operation. Dr Evans-Appiah apologised to the GMC for inventing false blood pressure and pulse readings. </p> <p>The committee heard that he had tried to walk out of the surgery with Darren's anaesthetic form and medical history after the boy's death. </p> <p>The GMC heard that Isla Denholm, Darren's mother, ran \"shouting and screaming at the receptionist\" when she realised something was wrong. </p> <p>In tears, she told the hearing: \"I could not believe it, he had just gone in to have a tooth out. All I remember is a lady in reception saying 'sorry' and I remember thinking, 'Why are you saying this?'.\" </p> <p>Since Darren's death, the government has accepted recommendations from a review chaired by the chief medical and dental officers that general anaesthesia in dentists' surgeries should be phased out. From 2002, it will only be allowed for dental work in a hospital. </p> <p>Three weeks after Darren's death, Dr Evans-Appiah gave Hazel Woolger, 33, from Maidstone, Kent, an epidural anaesthetic for a caesarean section to deliver her son Billy. In what she described to the GMC as \"like a nightmare on Elm Street\", Dr Evans-Appiah allowed a surgeon to cut into her abdomen even though she could feel the pain. </p> <p>She says she told the anaesthetist that she could feel the \"freezing cold\" of the ethyl chloride spray used to test whether sensation has gone, but he frowned and shook his head. Then she \"screamed in agony\" as the surgeon made his incision and suffered 45 minutes of intense pain. She said the feeling of the surgeon's hand removing the afterbirth from her womb was like \"being hit in the stomach with a sledgehammer.\" She said: \"I felt terrified, absolutely terrified.\" </p> <p>When the surgeon, Prosenjit Sarker, shouted at Dr Evans-Appiah to make her unconscious, saying, \"get her out, now\", the anaesthetist made another blunder described by GMC counsel Rebecca Poulet QC as \"a shocking illustration of professional standards\". </p> <p>He picked up from the floor of the theatre a piece of surgical equipment that is used to steer tubes into a patient's throat, which he had dropped. Then he wiped it on his trousers and licked it before putting it into Mrs Woolger's mouth.</p>",
  "<p>The controversy about a new England football manager reminds us that religion is not dying out. After Kevin Keegan, who will be the new saviour? </p> <p>Aside from the fact that football clubs such as Everton grew out of churches in the 19th century, there are important parallels between Christianity and football. Christianity has its 10 commandments, baptisms, vestments, The Lord's My Shepherd, shrines and cathedrals, martyrs and saints - and Vatican City. Football has its offside law, the first team debut (often a baptism of fire), team strip - and Wembley. </p> <p>The football stadium and the church both provide an outlet for communal praise and worship. An unsuspecting visitor to Rome in August might not have realised that the crowds chanting \"Viva La Papa\" were not football supporters but part of an estimated 2m pilgrims from 160 countries celebrating World Youth Day. </p> <p>But what really binds Christianity and football, and partly explains both fundamentalism and the kind of footballmentalism which marred Euro 2000, is that they are both messianic belief systems with the idea of a saviour at their core. In Glasgow, of course, fundamentalism and footballmentalism produce an explosive cocktail every time Celtic and Rangers clash. </p> <p>For Christians, Jesus is the revelation of the God of Abraham and Moses, and, as the 4th-century Nicene creed states: \"He will come again to judge the living and the dead.\" If you are a football supporter, your messianic expectations are focused on the more immediate arrival of the manager or player who will shepherd your people to the promised land of the league title or the cup. </p> <p>Keegan failed in this respect. Indeed, had he stayed on the other week, the calls of \"Crucify him!\" would have resounded through the land, with sports writers acting as scribes and pharisees. </p> <p>During my childhood, before football was gentrified - and when you did not need to be a linguist to read the programme's team list - the question was usually \"Derby or Forest?\" rather than \"Protestant or Catholic?\" For those were the days when another messiah, Brian Clough, stalked the touchline: \"Brian Clough walks on water,\" chanted the fans on the terraces and, as far as they were concerned, he did. </p> <p>In his recent book, God's Squad (2000), on footballers who embrace Christianity, Phil Shirley recounts a conversation between former England star Cyrille Regis and his ex-boss at West Bromwich Albion, Ron Atkinson. \"What's all this about you finding God? You worked for him at West Brom for four years,\" says Atkinson. \"Actually, Ron,\" replies Regis, \"there is only one God, and you are not him.\" </p> <p>To the faithful, their football club is not simply a multi-million pound leisure industry, a nursery for advertisers, or a set of stock exchange figures. And the suits who run the game ignore this at their peril. </p> <p>Like a church, a football club provides you with a focus for worship, a community with shared beliefs, history and myths, and a way of defining who you are in a society at a spiritual cross-roads. It can lead you to the heaven of winning a trophy or to relegation hell; in between is the purgatory of replays and play-offs. Football provides what Christianity claims to do: hope. </p> <p>But unlike Christianity, it does not answer the big questions of life, death and beyond. Rather, for 90 minutes it helps us to forget about these questions. Sometimes, we all need to forget but, sooner or later, we have to remember that football, for all its communal values, is entertainment and, unlike Christianity, not a religion - even if the Manchester United website comes with the banner, \"Love your team? Build a shrine.\"</p>",
  "<p>I guess we've all had days like it. Paranoia takes hold and you fear you're Jim Carrey in the Truman Show - trapped unsuspectingly in a 24/7 soap opera for the entertainment of TV viewers worldwide. Well, I have those days and this week my paranoia was tweaked a notch higher by a sneak preview of a forthcoming book about the City. </p> <p>The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism is a socio-economic study of the corporate fabric of the stock market over the past two decades. It traces the demise of the great British brokers and merchant banks of yesteryear and the emergence of the foreign-owned investment banking colossi that now call the shots in Throgmorton Street. It's a sudsy tale of collusion and cock-up and, says the author Philip Augar, should bring a tear to the reader's eye. </p> <p>Augar is a man with an awe-inspiring curriculum vitae as the head of global equities at, in turn, NatWest Securities and Schroder Securities. He's been there, done it and, in the process, earned the soubriquet Dr. Death from his ever-so-slightly-fearful staff. He's also passed Go a couple of times and has chosen the new career path of scriptwriter rather than soap star. </p> <p>Augar's Death is meticulously researched, leaving no stone on the rocky road from Big Bang unturned. At the same time he steers skilfully \"between academic analysis and populist commentary while avoiding the trap of failing to satisfy either academic or popular audience. Most of his readers, however, will be brokers and financiers searching avidly for enlightenment about shenanigans in their organisations and the odd fruity reference to themselves or workmates. </p> <p>It's a sorry tale familiar to anyone who has worked in the stock market in recent years. The \"great\" British names such as Rowe &amp; Pitman, Greenwell, James Capel and de Zoete &amp; Bevan have either disappeared or become codicils employed by megabanks keen for marketing purposes to retain quaint, faint resonances of the past. Goodbye, J. Henry Schroder Wagg! Hello, Schroder Salomon Smith Barney! </p> <p><strong> Professional contempt</strong><br> </p> <p> Augar lays the blame for the transfer of ownership of the City into foreign hands squarely at the feet of management. Restrained no doubt by the lawyers at Penguin Books, he stops short of outright charges of incompetence, but his professional contempt for those at the helm of many leading City firms through the upheaval of Big Bang lies just below the surface of his text. Try this for size: \"I believe that the speed and totality of the submission of the City's leading firms is one of the most abject surrenders in business history.\" </p> <p>It is less clear just why management should have been so poor, although Augar suspects class might have something to do with it. His text is laced with references to the cloth from which suits were cut, and the schools from which City managers were drawn. Tellingly, he puts the failure of his employer, NatWest Markets, to buy SG Warburg down to a clash of class between NatWest Markets' chief executive Martin Owen and Warburg's bluebloods. </p> <p>\"Owen is not a merchant banker; he has a regional accent, he mixes in different circles and he did not attend Oxbridge or a major public school. The Warburg people were classic gentleman capitalists and would not have been able to stomach reporting to him\". Ironically, Owen has long since disappeared from City life, brought down by a derivatives debacle that revealed flaws in his management structure, while many of the Warburg types are thriving under Swiss ownership. This episode highlights a weakness in Augar's position. As soap star turned scriptwriter, his views of people must necessarily be coloured by his experience working alongside them. Similarly, his view of the changing City cannot fail to be shaped by the firms he worked for at the time. I joined NatWest Markets after Augar had departed. My memories of many leading players in his tale are different. I also experienced the opening of the fault lines in the organisation that led to its fire-sale to Americans and which stemmed in part from the legacy of mismanagement in earlier years. NatWest loved the pursuit of trophies first and profits second - one of the diseases that did for the gentleman capitalists. </p> <p>Showboating is a classic trait of British brokers and financiers. We love to top league tables. We love press publicity. And, we love to demand the recompense from our masters that (we believe) should chime with the headlines. By contrast, American financiers worship their revenue dollars above all else. This shameless pursuit of the bottom line often jars with us Brits, but it's been a recipe for success. </p> <p><strong> Bear facts</strong><br> </p> <p> It's not clear whether the transfer of ownership overseas is a bad thing or not. Augar believes time - in the form of the next bear market - will tell that it is. He laments the loss of the Square Mile's heart and soul and believes \"the City is a branch office of New York with no control over its own destiny.\" </p> <p>It is doubtful, given the collective character flaws identified in this book, whether subjugation could have been avoided. Augar believes it could. He cites Eddie George, the Bank of England governor defending decisions not to rescue Barings or to avert the sale of Warburgs on the grounds that it is location not ownership that mattered. Augar would have had the Old Lady step in. </p> <p>Having witnessed Barings management for a couple of years pre-Nick Leeson I'm not sure they and their bank deserved a safety net. If the City postures to live by the sword, and to enjoy the rewards this brings, then it must die by it too. The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism indeed.

  "<p>US-style powers to break up large companies that abuse their market powers are being sought by the European competition commissioner, Mario Monti. </p> <p>In a move which has angered business organisations, which believe that the EC has deliberately kept quiet about the scale of its ambitions, EU officials have confirmed that Brussels wants the power to split offending companies into two or more parts. </p> <p>The EC will need to win over member governments and the European Parliament if Mr Monti's aims are to become law. </p> <p>If it is successful, however, Brussels would be on an equal footing with the US department of justice, which has sought to use its break-up powers in its epic battle with Microsoft. </p> <p>The EC has fined companies found guilty of price fixing or operating a cartel but is now seeking to go further. </p> <p>However, critics have accused the EC of deliberately keeping quiet about its plans in order to avoid a public debate. </p> <p>Mr Monti announced a reform package last month that would give Brussels the right to levy even bigger fines on errant companies and for the first time allow it to conduct searches of suspects' homes. </p> <p>But he failed to reveal that he also wants the power to force companies to make so-called structural changes and it was only after an observer spotted the innocuous-looking clause in the 62-page reform proposals that alarm bells began to ring. </p> <p>Unice, the Brussels-based lobby group representing some of Europe's biggest employers, says it is \"very concerned\" about the proposals. </p> <p>The relevant passage says: \"The commission is empowered to impose all the remedies necessary to bring the infringement to an end, including structural remedies. This may in particular be the case with regard to cooperation agreements and abuses of a dominant position where divestiture of certain assets may be necessary.\" </p> <p>The EC already has similar powers when it comes to vetting mergers but this clause represents a radical departure for Brussels and would give it serious muscle when it comes to dealing with cartels and monopolies which refuse to cooperate. </p> <p>Unice has said it will put its concerns in writing and the signs are that Mr Monti can expect some vociferous opposition. The EC is already viewed by some American companies which have seen their merger plans go up in smoke thanks to Brussels as being too powerful and this revelation is likely to produce a torrent of criticism from across the Atlantic.</p>",
  "<p>It is being billed as a new economy groundbreaker. HJ Heinz, purveyor of just about everything edible and sloppable from a bottle or can, has declared that part of its huge cable TV advertising spend in the US will henceforth be purchased through an online business-to-business market place -namely Freemarkets.com. </p> <p>The move it seems, has been sanctioned by William R Johnson, just the fifth man to run Heinz in its 131-year history, having taken over from the retiring Tony O'Reilly just a month ago. And it has America's media sellers shaking in their boots. Yesterday's experiment promised to be the first time that a major US advertiser was using a web-market to buy traditional media. </p> <p>The specific request was that any cable channel that wanted a piece of Heinz's Bagel Bites frozen pizza bagel advertising would have to submit quotes and plans on how to reach teenage and pre-teen males through the Freemarket website - effectively an online forum for matching buyers and sellers, where the seller pays a commission for business done. </p> <p>ESPN, one of the top cable networks on the other side of the Atlantic, immediately ruled itself out of the action. \"You need the participation of premium brands to make this work and my sense is at this point that the top media brands and networks see themselves as providing solutions rather than eyeballs,\" one official told the Industry Standard news service yesterday. </p> <p>An executive from NBC was equally disparaging about the Heinz move, fuelling a long-held suspicion that the sellers of media space in all its various forms are terrified that taking humans and schmooze out of the process will lead to lower prices, shorter lunches and ever-shrinking margins - across the board. </p> <p>This is classic new economy stuff. Heinz wants to use technology to add transparency and speed to what is little more than a commodity business - paying for eyeballs to focus on big consumer brands. But it is also new economy in another all too common sense - the technology is not yet being used in any meaningful way. </p> <p>Freemarket claims to be the first B2B marketplace. Its \"asset exchange\" covers perhaps 30 different sectors - everything from agriculture to wood panel manufacturing. Within each of these sectors there are literally dozens of individual categories, most related to pieces of industrial machinery. </p> <p>And, sadly, within each of these categories there are precious few buyers or sellers of anything. </p> <p>Browse through the mining pages, for example, and click on \"drills\" or \"excavation equipment\" or \"feeders\" and you will struggle to find any goods on the electronic shelves. The most vibrant Freemarket place seems to be in \"kettles\" where 400 are up for grabs. Telecommunications is more typical, where the best promise is one digital modem - lacking a price tag. </p> <p>The idea pioneered by Freemarket, and cloned by countless others, is impeccable. True execution, however, has yet to happen. The market in media advertising is like all other markets - it does not operate unless there is sufficient liquidity. One day the shooting match will be online. But it still feels some way off. </p> <p><strong> Supra Mario </strong><br> </p> <p> The European Union's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, is hardly anyone's idea of a bruiser. But since taking over as the commission's competition watchdog the donnish - that's as in academia not Sicily - Mr Monti has shown he has the credentials to be a member of anyone's awkward squad. </p> <p>He has not been content simply to set himself up as the consumers' friend: bashing beastly corporate cartels. He has shown he is prepared to confront governments over the vexed issue of public subsidies. As that means taking on a triumvirate of politicians, businesses and unions it is hardly a recipe for popularity. </p> <p>Mr Monti is also under fire from what critics argue is his failure to understand the new economy - to stand back and allow the pace of technological change to break down barriers rather than invoke his regulatory power. </p> <p>All well and good, you might say. Just what a competition commissioner should be doing, and hardly surprising for one who was previously the single market commissioner and who is intent on using his current office to carry on the good work. </p> <p>But now Mr Monti is looking to go a step further. To back up the stiff fines (at least on paper) which are his present sanction, Mr Monti wants new powers to break up companies which abuse their market position. </p> <p>This \"supra Mario\" approach to European business needs careful thought. Brussels is already unpopular enough with Europe's voters. A European equivalent of the US justice department's battle to break up Microsoft might well be misunderstood, adding to the already significant gap which separates commission and citizen.</p>",
  "What is happening in Cape Town depends on who you believe. <p>Some say a bomb blast this week - the 21st in two years - was the work of highly trained religious terrorists bent on turning South Africa's \"mother city\" into Algeria as a means of overthrowing the government. </p> <p>Others portray it as a lame attempt by a bunch of deluded incompetents capable of rigging no more than the most rudimentary explosion, exaggerated by the authorities to justify sweeping anti-terrorism legislation. </p> <p>Scotland Yard and the FBI have been called in to help track down the individuals responsible for the explosions in Cape Town that have killed three people and injured 134. No one was killed by the latest device, planted in a car parked on a busy street. </p> <p>The police and government are confident that the bombs are the work of a once popular Muslim vigilante group turned terrorist outfit, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad). </p> <p>Last week, more charges were added to those already faced by Pagad's leader, Abdus-Salaam Ebrahim, for murder and terrorism. More than 50 other Pagad members are either being tried or awaiting trial on similar charges. </p> <p>\"I want to state clearly that we know a lot about the people involved in urban terror,\" South Africa's safety and security minister, Steve Tshwete, told parliament. \"We know who the leaders are, we know who provides resources, and we know who carries out the acts of urban terror. I am absolutely convinced it is Pagad.\" </p> <p>The Western Cape's security minister, Hennie Bester, went further. He said the bombers were trying to overthrow the government. </p> <p>\"They want to overthrow the state,\" he said. \"There is some evidence they tried to produce larger fertiliser bombs. The intent for something much bigger is there but they haven't been able to execute it. My sense is we have the more technically proficient in prison.\" </p> <p>Last month, President Thabo Mbeki and Mr Tshwete warned that Pagad could turn Cape Town into Algeria. The comparison was clearly so ludicrous and so offensive to the city's Muslim community that it was quickly dropped. </p> <p>But the portrayal of Pagad as an organisation with secret bomb-making cells is being used to justify sweeping anti-terrorism legislation that some say is as draconian as laws from the PW Botha years. </p> <p>Among the provisions of the draft legislation is a clause that categorises any threat to the functioning of the state as terrorism, a term so broad as to potentially include strikes. The police will be able to carry out random street searches, and hold anyone with \"knowledge\" of \"urban terrorism\" for up to 14 days without charge. </p> <p>But the definition of urban terrorism is so unclear that any reporter who spoke to Pagad could be accused of it. </p> <p>\"Technically civil service strikes could be interpreted as terrorist activity under the bill,\" said Irvin Kinnes at the University of Cape Town's centre for conflict resolution. </p> <p>\"According to the draft legislation the police can also stop and search for any articles that may be used in a terrorist act. It means a police officer can detain anybody that his information says has knowledge of terrorist activity. We are questioning this because we've had such a long road to democracy in this country. It's the easiest way for the police to silence opposition.\" </p> <p>Even Mr Bester had doubts about the new legislation. </p> <p>\"I have serious reservations about it. I frankly believe you only go to that when you can't achieve what you want with good intelligence, good effective policing and a fairly good criminal justice system. And we don't have that at the moment,\" he said. </p> <p>In any case, Mr Bester admitted that the police were using apartheid-era security laws still on the statute books to lock up suspects. </p> <p>\"We have taken the key people off the streets. We used minor charges to get 30 or 40 people at the core, to keep them in prison. The latest bombs are much more amateurish. We've been pretty effective,\" he said. </p> <p>There are few who doubt that Pagad was responsible for an earlier spate of about 150 small pipe-bomb attacks that killed drug dealers and gangsters operating in the Cape Flats townships. But is it behind the explosions that have plagued the city of Cape Town over the past two years? </p> <p>The doubters question why a Muslim fundamentalist group supposedly bent on overthrowing the state would bomb pizzerias and nightclubs. As a terrorist force it has not been particularly effective - three deaths from 21 bombs have not had a big impact on a city that views murder and robbery pretty much as part of life. And while the government has secured dozens of convictions against Pagad members, not one is related to the blasts. </p> <p>Above all, if Pagad is attempting to bolster support for its cause through the bombings, it could not have pursued a worse strategy. </p> <p>The vigilantes once commanded overwhelming support within the Muslim community, and on the Cape Flats as a whole. Two years ago, opinion polls gave Pagad the backing of more than two-thirds of the area's population. But the support, which had the government scrambling to respond, collapsed as a result of the bombs. And if the organisation is pursuing a cause, where are its demands and claims of responsibility? </p> <p>To the sceptics, some of the bombings and their targets point to organised crime, probably extortion rackets. </p> <p>Doubters have latched on to the testimony of a police informer, Deon Mostert, who alleges that senior police officers with links to organised crime are involved in the bombings. Others note that South Africa's private security industry is making considerable amounts of money from the fears stoked by the bombings. </p> <p>The doubts extend to the business community, which is offering a 2m rand reward (\u00a3180,000) for the capture of the bombers. </p> <p>\"By making your opponent more important than he really is you justify your own incapacity,\" said the businessman behind the scheme, Michael Rubin. \"I'm not accusing Tshwete and Mbeki of that but talk to the local security guys and they'll tell you they are dealing with a highly organised, technically advanced group. It's not true. </p> <p>\"The security industry, and that includes the police, are not people that give me a great deal of confidence. They are getting nowhere.\" </p> <p>The most significant impact has been on Pagad itself. The most senior leader still free, Cassiem Parker, last week told what may well prove to be the organisation's final public rally that it is prepared to go underground if necessary. </p> <p>\"We don't know if we are going to meet again in this format to feel the togetherness we feel today. They can split us, but meet we will. We have a common cause, whether they like it or not,\" he said. </p> <p>Then he led the audience in chants of \"one gangster, one bullet\".</p>",
  "More than 50 government soldiers and police officers were killed this week in heavy fighting with leftwing rebels in the jungles of north-west Colombia, military sources said yesterday. <p>Among the dead were 22 troops on board a helicopter gunship which crashed after coming under fire. </p> <p>The US-made Blackhawk helicopter crashed on Thursday in an isolated jungle region as it ferried reinforcements to a town under attack from around 500 guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). </p> <p>The Colombian air force chief, General Hector Fabio Velasco, said that the helicopter went down after its tail rotor grazed a hill, but he acknowledged that the Blackhawk had come under ground fire moments before the accident. </p> <p>Thirty-two troops, two police officers and an unknown number of rebels died in heavy fighting around the town of Dabeiba, 230 miles north-west of Bogota, which has been besieged since Wednesday. </p> <p>Dabeiba lies on a key arms- and drugs-smuggling route linking the Panamanian border with central Colombia. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the whereabouts of at least 47 police officers remains unknown. It is feared they were either killed by the Farc or taken prisoner. </p> <p>Earlier this year, President Bill Clinton approved a $1.3bn (\u00a3900m) aid package for Colombia, which included up to 60 attack helicopters to support a military offensive targeting narcotics installations and the rebels who Colombian officials say profit from the drugs trade. </p> <p>Military sources say that the Farc does not posses anti-aircraft weapons, but last year the rebels downed a police helicopter with heavy machine-gun fire. </p> <p>The Farc routinely attacks rural police posts in overwhelming numbers, peppering them with homemade missiles, and either killing the outgunned officers or taking them prisoner. </p> <p>The surge in fighting comes ahead of nationwide local elections October 29, which rebels and rightwing paramilitary groups might try to disrupt.</p>",
  "These are the statistics. As of midday yesterday, the slaughter now engulfing Israel and the Palestinians had left 111 dead and so many wounded that the hospitals have lost count - perhaps more than 3,000. <p>For the outside world, the slaughter has just one face: Mohammed al-Direh, the 12-year-old boy who died three weeks ago in his father's arms after coming under Israel fire for 40 minutes. It was a death recorded in horrifying detail by a Palestinian cameraman. </p> <p>Those pictures led to widespread condemnation of Israel for excessive use of force against stone-throwing Palestinians. </p> <p>They also propelled thousands of Palestinian youths - including citizens of the Jewish state living inside Israel's borders - to join the violent protests. Since Mohammed's death on September 29 scores more have died. Here are five of them. </p> <p><b> Sara al-Haq </b><br> </p> <p> At the family home in Kusra, an isolated village near the West Bank city of Nablus, there is a poster of a proud father holding a pretty two-year-old girl. The gunsight superimposed in red ink over her copper-coloured curls is not immediately apparent. </p> <p>On the afternoon of October 1, Sara was running a temperature, and the girl described by her family as a little chatterbox was quiet and listless. So her father, Abid al-Azeem Abdul al-Haq, left his potter's workshop early to take her to a doctor in Nablus. </p> <p>He found total confusion: roadblocks and scores of Israeli soldiers with heavy armour. Three hospitals turned him away as they struggled to cope with incoming wounded. \"I was ashamed. There were a lot of wounded and I was just coming with a small girl running a temperature,\" her father said. It was well past 8pm, and dark when Mr al-Haq returned home with Sara in the back seat of his car cradled in the arms of her aunt, Reema Rabia. As he approached his village, he noticed a car idling by the side of the road. Mr al-Haq slowed down, and then sped up when he saw the car had yellow plates - which meant that it was an Israeli vehicle, possibly owned by settlers from the nearby Jewish settlement of Migdalim. There were two men in the back seat wearing skullcaps. </p> <p>As he overtook, the two men opened fire. The aunt grabbed Sara and lay down. Then she screamed that she had been shot. </p> <p>The child made no sound. Mr al-Haq did not stop driving until he reached the safety of his village. When he opened the car, Sara was in the well between the seats. Her brain had fallen out of her head. </p> <p>There were eight bullet holes in the car. Mr al-Haq says the settlers used to be welcome in the village. But he doubts they can live together now. </p> <p>\"I believe the mentality of the Jews is like the wild west with cowboys and Indians. They believe the guy with the biggest weapon is the king,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The guy who shot at our car did not want to kill me, or Sara, or Reema, or even Yasser Arafat. He just wanted to kill any Arab.\" </p> <p>Thirteen children have been killed in the violence, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. But they do not include Sara. That is because the organisation is still investigating contradictory claims by the Israeli army that she was killed by her own father when he was cleaning his gun inside the house, or that he opened fire on the settlers first. </p> <p>Kusra lies in a part of the West Bank that remains under Israeli security and administrative control. Mr al-Haq did not clean his daughter's blood off the red Renault for several days after her death, expecting the Israeli military or police to arrive to begin gathering evidence. </p> <p>No one came. </p> <p>\"Mohammed al-Direh was lucky because one of the journalists recorded the minute when he was killed. Sara was not,\" said her father. </p> <p><b> Khalil Lawrence </b><br> </p> <p> A member of Yasser Arafat's praetorian guard, Force 17, Khalil Lawrence was the bearer of two historic legacies. His grandfather fought with Lawrence of Arabia, and so when he had a son he named him after his British hero. </p> <p>Lawrence Khalil Badar's name was prophetic. He spent 26 years inside Israeli jails, dying in Beer Sheva prison five months ago, one year short of finishing a sentence for guerrilla attacks against Israel. </p> <p>Khalil Lawrence, aged 25, had not been born when Badar was sent to jail and his relationship with his father was confined to 45-minute visits once a month. </p> <p>His village, Beit Dukko, about 8 miles from Jerusalem's city centre, united to bring him up as their own. His mother, Amna Hussain, who had no other children, says neighbours offered financial help and showered the young Khalil with sweets. They told him stories of his father's bravery. </p> <p>When self-rule arrived in Israeli-occupied territories, Khalil's choice of career was inevitable. He joined the Palestinian security forces in 1995. In the early hours of October 12 Khalil was killed in a gun battle with Israeli security forces outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. Thousands took part in the funeral procession in an event that became crucial to the history of the last three weeks. </p> <p>Before Khalil could be buried, scores of mourners had hacked and burned to death two Israeli reservists. His mother is too torn by grief for her husband and son to feel sorry for them. </p> <p>\"I am against violence. Before Khalil died I asked him many times not to fight,\" she said.\"Now I think he was my only son and even if they kill all the Jews in the world it will not be enough for me.\" </p> <p><b> Yossi Tabaje </b><br> </p> <p> There were nine brothers in Binyamin Tabaje's family, which came from the Ethiopian city of Gondal. Four died at home of hunger and disease, and one on the long trek to Israel. </p> <p>Now there are three. The latest catastrophe to hit the Tabajes came on September 29, when Yossi, aged 26, a lieutenant in Israel's border police, was on patrol near the town of Qalqilya, which lies on the western fringes of the West Bank. </p> <p>By his brother Binyamin's account, Tabaje was ambitious. He enlisted in the army in the hope that it would help him get into university. He was garrulous and, as Binyamin warned him dozens of times, too quick to make friends. </p> <p>On the morning of his death he had stopped to take a drink and offered a sip to the Palestinian security forces who were travelling with him on the joint patrol. As his fellow officer watched in stunned silence, a Palestinian opened fire, killing Tabaje on the spot. </p> <p>The Israeli did not fire a shot and Yossi's elder brother, Binyamin Tabaje, is demanding an investigation. His killer later turned himself in to the Palestinian security forces. </p> <p>In the spice shop in the central Israeli town of Ramle where he works as a clerk, Binyamin is inconsolable. His younger brother had survived danger before, arriving in Israel as a child of 10 after trekking through Ethiopia and Sudan. </p> <p>\"We were always afraid something would happen to Yossi, but because we lost so many brothers and our mother, we thought that God would be merciful,\" said Binyamin. </p> <p>He cannot think beyond his pain and spends his days weeping over photo albums. \"I don't care at all about politics. What will be, will be. I am hurting too much to care.\" </p> <p><b> Asil Asleh </b><br> </p> <p> Perhaps no death encapsulates the feelings of betrayal and despair that have engulfed Israelis - Arabs and Jews - more than that of Asil Asleh, a teenager from the Galilee village of Arabeh who was shot dead on October 2. </p> <p>Asil, aged 17, had a big smile and was the king of networkers. He was addicted to chatrooms and email, and even for a teenager spent an immoderate amount of time on the phone, building up an unheard of circle of Jewish and Arab friends. </p> <p>For four years he had been a prime mover in Seeds of Peace, an American summer programme designed to bring two segregated communities together. \"It took all his life, and his enthusiasm,\" said his father, Hassan Asleh. \"He was not just anybody in this movement, he was the motor.\" </p> <p>He is still struggling to make sense of his son's death. He says Asil, who had gone to join a local protest strike, was first beaten by Israeli forces and then shot in the head at close range after he fell to the ground. \"I am beyond anger. I am furious: first that the government is not investigating, but also at the way they are killing all of us.\" </p> <p>In the end, though, he is true to his son's ideals. \"It has been very hard in this last period, but in my opinion we have to find a way to live together. We have no choice.\" </p> <p><b> Wisam Yazbak </b><br> </p> <p> The Jewish day of atonement was to have been the day of Wisam Yazbak's engagement and the Nazareth man, an Israeli Arab, had been working towards the day for months. </p> <p>He had built up a machinery firm from scratch and made enough money to buy a new villa. All he needed was his chosen bride, a nurse, also from Nazareth. </p> <p>But on October 8, when the setting sun had ushered in the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, a Jewish mob from Upper Nazareth descended on Wisam's neighbourhood, stoning houses. </p> <p>Although only 26, Wisam had some standing in the community and he joined the mayor and Israeli Arab politicians trying to cool down the situation. He was shot in the back of the head by police fire - becoming one of two Israeli Arab men to die that night. </p> <p>His mother cannot accept that the oldest of her five children is dead. </p> <p>\"She cannot believe her son was taken away. She keeps checking the door and waiting for him,\" said his uncle, Mahmoud Yazbak. </p> <p>Wisam was too much of a go-getter to take an interest in politics. But his uncle, a history professor at Haifa university, is a member of the Jewish-Arab Centre for Peace. \"I have not yet had time to think about the future. I don't know if I will leave all this, or if it will give me more power to work for co-existence between Arabs and Jews.\"</p>",
  "Weeping and demanding revenge, Israeli settlers in the West Bank yesterday pledged to fight Palestinians alone if the army would not defend them - adding a new and volatile element to the worsening crisis over the collapsing peace process. <p>Thousands of mourners, many armed, streamed to the settlement of Kedumim near Nablus to bury Rabbi Binyamin Herling, aged 60, killed in a clash with Palestinian gunmen on Thursday. </p> <p>Rabbi Haim Druckman, a veteran activist, gave a tearful eulogy and called on Israel's leaders to halt peace negotiations. \"What else needs to happen before they open their eyes?\" he asked. </p> <p>Questions were still being asked about why a 36-strong group of civilians, including several children, had been allowed to go on what they billed as a hike so close to the West Bank's largest Arab town at a time of such tension. </p> <p>Palestinians accused the settlers of having started the trouble by shooting and killing a farmer picking olives on the rugged slopes of Mount Ebal - the second such incident in as many days. </p> <p>But the participants expressed no regrets. One teenage girl said she felt it her \"duty\" to be there. </p> <p>\"Many people are deeply frustrated,\" one of their leaders warned. \"We cannot pass over in silence something like this. There will be a very tough reaction.\" </p> <p>Settlers are already furious at the loss of Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish religious site inside Nablus which was abandoned by its Israeli army defenders and ransacked by a Palestinian mob two weeks ago. </p> <p>Just days later another rabbi, Hillel Lieberman, from the nearby outpost of Elon Moreh, was kidnapped and killed by Palestinians. His bullet-riddled body was found in a cave. </p> <p>Bitterly opposed to the Oslo peace process since it began in 1993, these highly-motivated and in some cases fanatical people insist they will fight to stay in what they see as God-given land. </p> <p>And with all the fire and fury of true believers anywhere, they have been quick to accuse successive Israeli governments of betraying them and appeasing their worst enemies. </p> <p>Daniella Weiss, one of their leading spokespeople, accused the army of abandoning the hiking party under fire on Thursday because the prime minister, Ehud Barak, was trying too hard to abide by this week's Sharm al-Sheikh summit call for a ceasefire. </p> <p>Many of the 200,000 settlers feel this is their darkest hour since the 1967 war, when Israel's capture of the West Bank from Jordan was followed by the creation of new outposts, often set up provocatively close to Palestinian towns and villages. </p> <p>But settlements that began 30 years ago as a few caravans and a generator on a lonely hilltop have now become small towns thanks to land confiscations, purchases through shadowy middlemen and cheap mortgages that attracted young couples, many of whom continue to commute across the \"green line\" into Israel proper. </p> <p>The largest of the 145 settlements are probably close enough to the old border, or in large enough contiguous blocs, to be annexed to Israel in any final peace deal. But the more isolated outposts - including most of those in the Nablus area, which tend to attract highly committed ideologues - would have to go. </p> <p>It is these hardliners who have regularly attacked Palestinians, often after stones have been thrown or shots fired at their vehicles on lonely roads. Tension is extremely high. </p> <p>Some of the extremists are supporters of Meir Kahane, an American-born rabbi - later murdered by an Egyptian in the US - who called openly for the expulsion of all Arabs from Israel and the West Bank. Placards saying \"Kahane was right\" can be seen plastered all over the country at the moment. </p> <p>It was the hothouse atmos phere of ideological opposition to any concessions to the Arabs that bred Yigal Amir, who assassinated the former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, the architect of Oslo, in 1995. </p> <p>Palestinian leaders accuse settlers of repeated acts of violence, and call openly for attacks against them. </p> <p>On Thursday Hebrew graffiti insulting the prophet Mohammed was discovered in Hebron, a centre for some of the most uncompromising extremists. </p> <p>Violence is in the air as Oslo dies its slow death. Israel's Peace Now movement warns that it is not enough to demand the disarmament of Palestinian militias, but says the Jewish settlers must surrender their weapons too.</p>",
  "Israeli tanks pounded a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Jerusalem yesterday as some of the deadliest clashes of the recent violence shattered any hope for the ceasefire agreed at an emergency Middle East summit. <p>On a day that resembled an undeclared war, at least 10 Palestinians were killed in clashes that raged the length of the West Bank. Fighting with automatic weapons, combat helicopters and tanks stepped up the pressure on Arab leaders to take decisive action when they gather in Egypt today to discuss the escalating crisis, and on Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak. Mr Barak said yesterday he would decide after the weekend summit whether to pronounce the peace process officially dead. If the violence continues \"we will take time out to re-evaluate the situation\" he told Israeli television. </p> <p>Yesterday he met the rightwing Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, to explore the possibilities of an emergency government. But Likud, which has been riding high in opinion polls on the back of the violence, was coy. A poll in yesterday's Ma'ariv newspaper showed that if elections were held today, 41% of Israelis would vote for the Likud leader and 31% for Mr Barak. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Israel's foreign ministry said yesterday it would not cooperate with an investigation announced by the UN human rights commissioner, Mary Robinson. </p> <p>The latest lethal convulsions killed off hope that the ceasefire brokered by Bill Clinton would take hold. Minutes before the deadline for the truce, negotiated this week in Egypt, Palestinian gunmen hiding in an olive grove opened fire on an Israeli roadblock south of Nablus. The soldiers returned fire, killing five. </p> <p>Two Palestinian teenagers died after being shot in the head by Israelis in stone-throwing clashes in the West Bank town of Ramallah and the village of Salfit, near Nablus. Other teenagers died in Qalqiliya and Tulkarm, and another man in Jenin. Also in Tulkarm, six Israeli soldiers were wounded when their lorry took a wrong turn. </p> <p> Tanks outside a block of flats in Gilo, a Jerusalem suburb built on land occupied by Israel since 1967, fired on the nearby village of Beit Jalla, hitting a church club. Israeli attack helicopters also fired on the village of Beit Sahour, near Bethlehem. </p> <p> In Jerusalem an uneasy calm prevailed after Friday prayers on the Haram al-Sharif or Temple Mount, site of the provocative visit by Mr Sharon which is widely seen as the trigger for the present crisis. </p> <p>Hundreds of troops and police were on duty, checking that only men over 45 entered the mosques. Inside the Old City's Damascus Gate, police wielded batons to keep back a large crowd of worshippers as clusters of camera crews hovered. Palestinian youths tried to break through a cordon but were rebuffed without violence. </p> <p>Throughout Israel tensions were high as security forces braced for terrorist attacks from Hamas militants freed by the Palestinian Authority. </p> <p>The movement's leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, said in Gaza: \"Not only Hamas, but all the Palestinian people, are ready for the confrontation and Hamas is at the head. We never throw away our weapons at any time.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton, who convened the Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt on Monday, had hoped that violence would diminish enough by the weekend to allow peace talks to restart. Instead, there was more killing, and more recrimination. </p> <p>The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, Major-General Yitzhak Eitan warned that any violations - especially by Tanzim militiamen from the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction - would be met with force. \"If the Palestinians won't stop the Tanzim from shooting at our forces, we will not have any choice but to shoot back.'' </p> <p>The Palestinians accused Israel of ignoring security understandings and failing to withdraw its tanks from the outskirts of cities. </p> <p> \"Since the Sharm el-Sheikh understandings were reached, the Israelis have violated them ... Their objective is to destroy these understandings,\" said Nabil Abu Rdainah, an Arafat aide. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, said Israel had never been serious about observing a truce. \"The killing field there goes on,\" he said, demanding that Mr Clinton intervene again. </p> <p> Mr Erekat said he believed Mr Barak had been looking for excuses to withdraw from peace negotiations. \"What we are witnessing is Barak's exit strategy,\" he said. </p> <p> Israel accused Mr Arafat of orchestrating the violence to use as a negotiating tool. But to the now familiar violent scenes unfolding across the West Bank and Gaza, there was a new element yesterday. In the West Bank town of Hebron, demonstrators carried a mock coffin with the words Sharm el-Sheikh written on it. \"We don't care about the deadline,\" said a defiant Taysir Natshe, 17. \"We just want a Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital.\"</p>",
  "<b> Solana faces court action</b> <br> <p> Institutional warfare broke out in Brussels yesterday after it emerged the European parliament is taking the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, to court for blocking public access to documents about security and defence. </p> <p>In an unusual move, the majority of political parties in the assembly decided to follow the example of the Dutch government and mount a legal challenge to the rules introduced over the summer which classify as secret all documents on military and crisis management issues. </p> <p>The case will be heard before the Luxembourg-based European court of justice and is a severe embarrassment to Mr Solana, who has been accused of staging \"a military coup\" over the issue. </p> <p>EU diplomats argue, however, that high levels of secrecy are essential if the EU is to develop a serious capability to match its economic muscle. </p> <p>Civil liberties campaigners fear that the sweeping new controls could be extended to cover non-military matters such as criminal justice, border controls and trade policy and believe that Nato's paranoid culture of secrecy has been let in through the back door. </p> <p>The new code will enable Nato and non-EU governments to veto the disclosure of EU documents. Heidi Hautala, a Green MEP who pushed hard for legal action, said: \"All last minute efforts by certain political groups and governments to stop this important action failed. This is a big victory.\" </p> <p> Andrew Osborn, Brussels<br> </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Recovery of Kursk dead begins</b><br> </p> <p> More than two months after the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in the Arctic in Russia's worst maritime disaster in peacetime, the operation to recover the corpses of the 118 seamen got under way yesterday when a huge Norwegian diving platform arrived at the site of the tragedy in the Barents sea. </p> <p>Eighteen divers were poised to descend to the stricken submarine from the Regalia platform to assess the possibility of bringing out the bodies after an unmanned mini-submarine had surveyed the wreckage. </p> <p>The divers are expected to start going down today in teams of three, each containing two Russians. The recovery mission could take three weeks and the first attempt to bring out the dead - if made at all - is not expected until next week. </p> <p>Despite repeated assertions from President Vladimir Putin that everything would be done to assist the still grieving relatives of the victims, the aid effort was damned as arrogant and ignorant by Irina Lyachina, the widow of the Kursk commander, Capt Gennady Lyachin. </p> <p>She announced that she was quitting the commission established to assist the relatives because it had been turned into a vehicle for corrupt local politicians. </p> <p>\"The wives of Kursk crew members took part in sessions of the commission, but nobody discussed any of the issues they raised,\" she said. </p> <p>She was disgusted at the allocation of money to certain projects, including \u00a3500 to prepare a book on the August 12 tragedy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, on Thursday, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the navy chief, said he would not risk any more lives in the recovery mission and could call off the effort. </p> <p>Russian officials said gale force winds could force the postponement of the operation by a week. Norwegian officials denied there were weather problems. </p> <p>The Russians have yet to report publicly on what caused the two explosions that sank the Kursk. </p> <p>Ian Traynor, Moscow<br> </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Hungary returns Nazi loot</b><br> </p> <p> A Budapest court ruled yesterday that 10 paintings, including works by Van Dyck, Lucas Cranach the elder, El Greco and Gustave Courbet, are the property of Martha Nierenberg, an American-Hungarian citizen, and must be handed over to her within 15 days. </p> <p>The value of the pictures is estimated at $5m (\u00a33.5m). </p> <p>The verdict is expected to trigger an avalanche of claims from other, mostly Jewish, owners of artwork. </p> <p>Ms Nierenberg is the granddaughter of Baron Mor Herzog, a Hungarian aristocrat of Jewish background and one of the country's most famous art collectors in the first half of the 20th century. </p> <p>Baron Herzog died in 1934 and divided his large collection of works by old masters between his three children. </p> <p>Hidden in a Budapest cellar from the Nazis, who occupied Hungary in 1944, they were discovered by the police and personally seized by Adolf Eichmann, the man entrusted by Hitler with the extermination of the Jews. </p> <p>Part of the collection, including the 10 paintings Ms Nierenberg has won back, were taken out of the country to the west, where they were found by US troops and returned to Hungary. </p> <p>A family representative succeeded in smuggling out some paintings and as a punishment, the state seized the rest, declaring them state property in 1954. </p> <p>Nick Thorpe, Budapest<br> </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Gadafy may face French crash trial </b><br> </p> <p> A French appeal court yesterday ruled that the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, could face prosecution in France over the 1989 bombing of a French jetliner that killed 170 people. </p> <p>In an embarrassing decision for Paris, which is trying to finesse Col Gadafy back into the international fold, the court rejected the state prosecutor's arguments that, as a sitting head of state he could not be prosecuted. </p> <p>The decision effectively gives France the green light to try and bring Mr Gadafy to trial for \"complicity in murder in relation to a terrorist act\". </p> <p>Relatives of the passengers and crew on board the DC-10 of the UTA airline, which crashed over Niger en route from the Republic of Congo to Paris, launched the action against the Libyan leader after a French court last year tried six Libyans - including Col Gadafy's brother-in-law - in absentia for the bombing and sentenced them to life imprisonment. </p> <p>Col Gadafy would be tried for Libya's alleged role in supplying logistical aid to the bombers, protecting them after their conviction and supplying false documents during the investigation. </p> <p>Franco-Libyan relations began to ease last year after Tripoli paid \u00a320m to the crash victim's families in an apparent admission of responsibility. Paris considered inviting Col Gadafy to a summit of international leaders in Marseille next month. </p> <p>Jon Henley, Paris<br> </p> <p> <b> Dozens die in Angolan road attack</b><br> </p> <p> Two buses and a car travelling along a rural road in Angola were set on fire, killing dozens of people, witnesses told a church broadcaster yesterday. </p> <p>Gunmen burned one of the buses with the passengers still inside during the attack on Wednesday at Andurie, about 75 miles east of the capital, Luanda, the Roman Catholic Radio Ecclesia reported. </p> <p>Police found corpses inside the bus when they arrived 12 hours later, the witnesses said.

  "The Irish National Liberation Army killers of the hardline loyalist Billy Wright were released from jail in Co Londonderry yesterday less than three years after they shot him dead in the Maze prison. <p>Christopher McWilliams, who has two previous murder convictions, said as he left Magilligan prison that he backed calls for a public inquiry into the assassination of Wright, 37, leader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force. </p> <p>But McWilliams, 36, denied there was any security force collusion in the killing, which happened as Wright was getting into a minibus to take him from his H-block to the prison visiting centre to meet his partner. He was shot several times at point-blank range two days after Christmas in 1997. </p> <p>There have long been allegations that Wright was set up for the killing. Unusually, the watchtowers above the yard were unmanned and security cameras were switched off, allowing the three assailants to clamber unobserved over the roof of their wing in the same H-block in order to carry out the attack. </p> <p>David Wright, the victim's father, has visited the Irish government to garner support for an inquiry, supported by British-Irish Rights Watch, more usually associated with nationalist cases. The group will release its report at Westminster next week. </p> <p>McWilliams, serving life at the time he killed Wright for shooting dead Colm Mahon, a Belfast doorman who had ejected him from a nightclub, was released with his accomplice, John Kennaway. John Glennon, the third man jailed for the murder, had been freed the previous day. </p> <p>Under the terms of the early release scheme, they were required to serve a minimum of two years for the Wright murder, despite the majority of paramilitary prisoners being freed in July. They were jailed for life at Downpatrick crown court in October 1998 for the Wright killing. </p> <p>McWilliams, greeted by about 20 INLA supporters as he left the jail, said of the Wright shooting: \"As an INLA volunteer at the time, I have no regrets. But I want to emphasise that as an individual I took no personal satisfaction out of playing my role to eliminate Billy Wright.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We would fully support anyone's call for the British government to instigate any inquiry so as to establish the facts leading to and during our participation in the operation against Billy Wright.\"</p>",
  "<p>Geoffrey Robinson would like us to believe he has done the government a good turn this week. The ruling clique of the New Labour cabinet, he says, has been riven with personal rivalries and political schisms since its inception and was in need of some healing. So he obliged by writing a book, The Unconventional Minister, which detailed the nature of these splits, resurrected old grievances and accused Peter Mandelson, the prime minister's closest ally, of being a conniving mischief-maker who misled the party, the House and the public. </p> <p>Robinson sold it for serialisation to the newspaper most hostile to the Labour party, the Daily Mail, which splashed his story. The rest of the press followed suit. The upshot was that the cabinet duly appeared as a sleazy, bickering, money-grabbing bunch of prima donnas. This coverage, says Robinson, will help not only the prime minister and Mandelson, but contribute to the government's stability and improve its standing in the eyes of the public. Bridges had to be built, so the Labour MP and former minister thought he would knock some down. </p> <p>\"There may be an initial reaction that will say: 'We could have done without that,' \" says Robinson. \"But I think the more mature reflection will be: 'Yes, there was a very important point Geoffrey was trying to make there, and I think we should tackle it.' \" </p> <p>If this sounds disingenuous it is because it is. It seems as though Robinson, the 62-year-old former paymaster general whose \u00a3373,000 loan to Mandelson forced both of them to resign in December 1998, just cannot help it. Every time he has opened his mouth this week in order to sound sincere, something ludicrously insincere pops out. If he says he has \"nothing but the greatest respect for Peter Mandelson\" you know he is about to trash him. When he writes: \"The public hates to see politicians squabbling and punishes divided governments,\" you know he is about to squabble in a way that will divide the government. </p> <p>He says he has not been surprised at the anti-Labour reception the book has got, but will be surprised if Labour does not benefit. \"It was never intended to be a political version of a kiss and tell,\" he says. \"The serious points I've concentrated on only after considerable and careful thought. I wanted it to be constructive, I wanted it to contribute to making the government more effective and I believe that over time it will have that impact.\" </p> <p>The serious and constructive points revealed in the Mail's serialisation include the following: Robinson was \"miffed\" that he had not been invited to Mandelson's housewarming party; Mandelson, not him, raised the issue of a loan for his house in Notting Hill at a dinner party; and Mandelson \"remains a destabilising influence between the prime minister and his chancellor\". Now Mandelson is back in government, as a minister, while Robinson remains an outcast. </p> <p>To call this revenge would be to make far too great a claim for it. By his own admission he has far more damaging material in the way of personal letters, that he says he will not release. So this is pique at its pettiest. The politics of the playground, only with far bigger stakes. It is an attempt at political assassination by biography which may well backfire. For it bears the hallmarks of the injured van ity of an insider who is now out; the conflicted allegiances of a man who has status but craves respect; the disingenuousness of a multimillionaire who thinks money makes no difference. If this is serious, you wonder what he would call trivial; if it is constructive, you wonder what he would call damaging. </p> <p>It is a contradiction inherent in the very project he himself embarked on - to settle a score in print without appearing bitter in person. \"The two main aims of what I wanted to achieve are first to counteract the impression of me that I was the sort of person who would use money to promote his own career, curry influence even to obtain a job, which seemed to be a certain element of this from the press attacks that came into this equation. I hope people can see a different person from the one they might have imagined. The second, after considerable reflecton, to raise the issue of Mandelson's role in government. From the beginning I realised how talented he is. But he must stop briefing against colleagues.\" </p> <p>The Park Room, at the Grosvenor House hotel, is an unlikely setting for the outpourings of a victim. Its windows look straight out on to Hyde Park, the furniture is plush and a cup of tea costs more than \u00a34. Upstairs single rooms go from \u00a3267 a night. This is where Geoffrey Robinson stays when he is in London. From the eighth floor, with a glorious view of Park Lane, he sits like a benevolent Master of the Universe - sipping champagne while pontificating on the plight of the poor. It is here that he used to hold \"tax and pasta parties\" with Gordon Brown and his advisers, Charlie Whelan and Ed Balls, while elaborating Labour's economic strategy for the 1997 election. </p> <p>Robinson arrives with a limp he incurred in the gym. His friendliness often threatens to break out into charm but is kept in check by his lack of candour. Just when he appears affable, a straight question: \"What should Blair do if Mandelson fails to become a team player?\" meets an evasive answer: \"I don't want to get into that\" and the bonhomie evaporates. Despite many accounts to the contrary, he maintains that Blair did not ask him to sell the New Statesman to Robert Harris and that nobody from Blair's team asked him not to publish his book. </p> <p>His penthouse is just one of many homes. Ask him how many and he will not, or cannot, give a straight answer. \"It depends how you count them I suppose. We have a little hamlet in Italy which has several buildings on it and a house here in the country. Those are our main two residences,\" he says. And the one in Cannes? \"Yes, we do have one flat in Cannes.\" So there is the Orchards, the Lutyens mansion in Godalming, Surrey; the Tuscan villa; and the bolthole on the Riviera that slipped his mind. The one place he does not have a home is in his own constituency of Coventry North West. </p> <p>Robinson came by this wealth honestly, if, at times, mysteriously. While running British Leyland's Italian car division in Milan he befriended Joska Bourgeois, a wealthy, flamboyant woman who held the Belgian Jaguar franchise. He married a Maltese-born opera singer, Marie Elena, and would later become the chief executive of Jaguar before going on to run his own business. His close relationship with Bourgeois continued. She lent him \u00a35,000 to start a small company called Transfer Technology, later renamed Transtech. By the time he became a treasury minister it was worth \u00a330m. When Bourgeois died in 1994, she left him \u00a39m and had already set up an offshore trust fund for his family in Guernsey called Orion. While there is no shortage of rumours about the reson for her generosity, nobody knows for sure and Robinson will not say. </p> <p>His wealth left him well connected. He shares a health club with Gordon Brown and Michael Barrymore, and shared a lawyer and a business with the late media tycoon, Robert Maxwell. In 1994, he acquired the New Statesman magazine. Add this to his political career and you have a heady mix. A man who cannot possibly locate the blurry line where financial influence stops and political influence begins because he lives his life on both sides at once. He twice loaned the Blair family his home in Tuscany for their summer holidays, gave a huge personal loan to Mandelson and contributed generously to the offices of both Brown and Blair, as well as former Labour leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith. </p> <p>His generosity has left all three points of the troubled triangle of intrigue in government in his debt. It is a position that makes him simultaneously powerful and vulnerable, since it leaves a constant question mark over his access to power. Robinson, though, is one of the few people who sees no conflict of interest in dishing out huge sums of money to his boss and colleagues. \"If what you're saying is that most people would expect some quid pro quo, preferment, being courted or an honour, then all I can tell you is that that's not the way I operate. Everyone I have helped over the years will tell you that Geoffrey does not seek any thing in return for myself or my business or my family.\" </p> <p>A businessman who expects no return on his investment. Since he says it is so and there is no way to disprove it, then let it be so. It does not get rid of the question mark. For how would we know that those to whom he has done good turns say what they say because it is true and not because he has given them money, and they do not wish to appear ungrateful by portraying him in a bad light? </p> <p>When pushed, he will concede what most adults take for granted. When substantial sums of money change hands between friends, the friendship itself changes. \"I suppose that is bound to be true to some extent. The important thing is the extent of the extent. With me, I never refer to any kindness I've done. I certainly don't expect anything back. I just make it clear it was something I was able to do and that's that. That's the end of it.\" </p> <p> The trouble is that it is not the end of it. It is only the beginning. If ever there is an example of how wealth affects friendships then Robinson is it. Were he not in the position to lend the money to Mandelson - or be asked for it - depending on whom you believe, he would still be in government. If New Labour learns something from his experiences, the lesson has been lost on Robinson. He still insists that, if he had his time over, he would still lend Mandelson the money. \"I don't regret it all. He made a good profit on the house, so I don't suppose he does either. When we did it, it was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. Where it went wrong is that he should have declared it when he was a minister or arranged to refinance it, which I'm sure he could have done.\" </p> <p>In the absence of a job or public sympathy, it is down to Robinson to absolve himself. Quite where he gets this confidence from is not clear. He was born in Sheffield in 1938 and raised in Balham, south London, to working-class parents. His mother worked at home; his father - a man with taut bootstraps and entrepreneurial flair -started in a furniture shop and ended up mortgaging the family house so he could buy a furniture factory. \"Politics weren't big in the family but we were definitely Labour supporting. By background we were working class - there were no books at home, we weren't encouraged to read but play football in the winter and cricket in the summer. I was the first of the family to go to university.\" </p> <p>Robinson won a scholarship to a grant-maintained school, Emmanuel College. His self-assurance was not diminished by mixing with children from more cultivated backgrounds. \"We were working class culturally but by that time, my father's work was going well and we were comparatively well off. So we had a sense of being better off materially than those living close to us.\" </p> <p>From there, he went to Cambridge to study modern languages, and gained another scholarship to Yale. \"I met Harold Wilson and he encouraged me to come back to the Labour party so I did.\" \"The big captivating force for me was Kennedy,\" he says. \"I hadn't been active in politics at Cambridge but I got very active in the Yale in Mississippi campaign.\" This was in 1963, one of the most dangerous times in the history of the south's most redneck state. A year later, during the Mississippi Freedom Summer, three young men were murdered in cold blood, striking terror in the hearts of civil rights workers and providing the storyline for the film Mississippi Burning. A strange place and a strange time to cut your political teeth. \"Well, some of my friends were involved in it and while I had not been politically active I had always been politically and socially aware.\" </p> <p>But his political career has been patchy. When he came back to Britain he joined the Labour party and soon started working for it as a researcher. In 1976, he was elected as Labour MP for Coventry North West and earned a sufficiently grand reputation among the Bennite left that the late Eric Heffer suggested he should become head of the National Enterprise Board. By the early 80s, he had fallen out with the left and rose through the ranks as a spokesman on science, regional affairs and then trade and industry. </p> <p>But as his wealth in Transtech grew, he lost interest in politics. In 1986, he stood down as a Labour party industry spokesman. \"Nobody was taking us seriously,\" he says. \"I couldn't operate with the people I knew from industry against the background of the policies that we were going to fight the 1987 election on.\" In 1988 and 1989, he made no speeches in the House at all. In 1989 he came close to being deselected by his local party - hanging on with just 51% of the vote. </p> <p>Given his low profile, his rehabilitation within the party during the 90s was quite miraculous. Until the mid 90s, he was listed by Labour whips as being one of the two most difficult MPs to find to vote against the Tories. But by the end of 1996 he was back as the acceptable face of New Labour; by 1997 he was on the front bench. </p> <p>It is then that the various strands of his past, that had previously been of little interest to anyone, started to unravel. Questions arose over his relationship to Maxwell and the pillaged pension funds; over the offshore trust, sitting pretty in a tax haven, while Robinson oversaw a reduction in the amount that most people could save tax-free through ISAs; the accusation of fraudulent applications for department of trade and industry grants for Transtech. He was forced to apologise to the House by the Commons select committee on standards and priveleges for failing to register his interest in a company he created in 1996. The apology was five sentences long and took only 54 seconds. The next day, the Labour- supporting Express ran a front- page picture of him with the headline \"Has he no shame?\" </p> <p>While he had done nothing illegal, he was becoming an embarrassment to a party which had promised that the Tory years of sleaze would be replaced by an administration that was \"purer than pure\". Blair wanted him to resign but then relented \"out of deference to Gordon and me,\" says Robinson. \"Anyone else would have been out on their ear.\" </p> <p>Moreover, Robinson showed not only no shame, but no remorse either. \"These were acts of omission not commission,\" he says. \"There was no hidden agenda or money in brown envelopes or anything of that kind. The speech was short because there was nothing more to say because there was nothing more to apologise for.\" </p> <p>Then came the loan, the resignations, the bitterness and now the authored recrimination which says Robinson has done nothing wrong and Mandelson has. But Robinson got the blame and Mandelson didn't. The truth of the matter somehow seems less striking than the depths to which it has all sunk. </p>",
  "<p>There are wondrous and awful things in the exhibition Spectacular Bodies, at London's Hayward Gallery. As the exhibition's subtitle - The Art and Science of the Human Body from Leonardo to Now - suggests, this is a vast collection of objects, paintings, drawings and engravings, of medical models, skeletons in cupboards, pickled foetuses, life and death masks, flayed figures, surgical tools and (inevitably) modern art. </p> <p>The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Jan Deijman, Rembrandt's ruin of a painting, depicting a cadaver with a peeled scalp, open skull and gelatinous mass of brain, is but one of the rarely seen marvels and curiosities that make this such a compelling and unmissable show. </p> <p>But we have been here before, even down to the reworkings of Charcot's dubious demonstrations of female hysteria in Paris at the end of the 19th century by a modern artist, and the display of Alphonse Bertillon's photographs of criminal types for the Paris police. This exhibition is but another reworking of the subject, done on a grand scale. Only the examples and alignments have changed. </p> <p>Franz Xavier Messerschmidt's gurning and grimacing heads, made in late 18th-century Vienna, were last shown in London in juxtaposition with drawings by Arnulf Rainer. Now they sit between a cabinet of life and death masks, including the heads of Edinburgh \"resurrectionists\" Burke and Hare, and a tormented sculpture by Marc Quinn. Where Charcot's studies in female hysteria have previously been matched, for example, with Louise Bourgeois sculptures of the Arch of Hysteria, here Charcot is allied with the American Beth B. Not that there's anything much wrong with this, except that Beth B is such a terribly dull artist, the kind that academics like because they cover all the right points and make good lecture illustrations. </p> <p>The exhibition is an inevitably flawed attempt at a kind of completeness. The return, by some of today's artists, to certain of the techniques, materials and strate gies of the anatomical model- makers of the past does not signal a continuity of purpose. Our view of the body has always been filtered by the mores of the time, and by the relationship between \"scientific\" and other kinds of enquiry. It is difficult, if not impossible, to be dispassionate about ourselves, or to be immune to the culture of our own time. Look at the changing attitudes towards the body, and the entirety of human culture is revealed with them - moral values and economics, attitudes towards women, sexuality and childbirth, sin and virtue, the treatment of different races, attitudes towards death and the place of the soul. </p> <p>When the modern artist John Isaacs constructs, in the manner of his forebears, an accurate, life-size model of a partly dismembered corpse (though one that looks as though it has been fought over and gnawed at by dogs rather than dissected by an anatomist), he presents us with an artwork contrived to fit a vacant academic niche. If it says anything about modern attitudes to death - and of what is fit to be seen - it is that we are inured to its horrors. This is a work about what is fit to be seen, and about how much one can bear. It is grisly, but not so grisly as a photo of a hacked-up corpse from a war zone. It is mere spectacle. Robbie Williams's recent pop video, in which the singer is digitally flayed and dismembered, says as much - and as little. </p> <p>Not three years ago, Deanne Petherbridge mounted a similar but smaller show about art and anatomy, The Quick and the Dead, for the touring exhibitions depart ment of the Hayward Gallery. In Visible Light: Photography and Classification in Art, Science and the Everyday - at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, in the same year - focused on some of the same issues in 19th-century photography. The keynote show for the 1995 Venice Biennale, Identity and Alterity, covered some similar ground, too, and also included Bertillon's photographs and the montaged physiognomies of Gerhard Lang. </p> <p>Spectular Bodies is, in other words, another baggy compendium. Of course, it touches - bloodily - on the ways we have regarded ourselves over five or six centuries; and it is right to include the topics it does. It is inevitably fascinating, gory, filled with pathos, horror and what, to modern eyes, are very peculiar attempts to moralise, aestheticise, illustrate and teach. Its subject - ourselves - is the most fascinating subject of all. </p> <p>The human body is a wonder, a spectacle, a thing of awesome complexity and subtlety. It is also capable of consciousness, of itself as much as of the world about it. The return to the body in the art of the past decade has certainly been a major preoccupation. The works here that deal with it, or allude to it, or revel in it, are the least impressive aspect of the exhibition. Only Christine Borland's animation of 19th-century drawings of a boy with muscular dystrophy, whose laborious and tragic attempts to stand are repeated over and over in a series of projections up the Hayward ramp, instil real disquiet and pathos. These simple images stay with me. Tony Oursler's video projections - a speaking mouth projected onto bull's testicles in a jar, and also onto a little rag doll - don't really seem to belong. Bill Viola's film of open-heart surgery, projected over a made-up, empty bed in a darkened room, is a relatively minor work, but one of the very few here that deal with the absence of the body: it is a truly disembodied work. </p> <p>Yet what contemporary artist can compete with the hyper-real anatomical waxworks of the past? Joseph Towne's Section of the Thorax at the Level of the Heart, from 1829, with its thrown-back head, cavernous open mouth and staring eyes, is in a state of absolute extremis. Nothing more can be said; it is an expression of irreducible mortality. </p> <p>The most shocking thing about Rembrandt's painting is not the peeled head, but the chasm of the thorax, and the fact that its darkness is not quite as black and inert as the painting's background. For me, it is the most mysterious thing in the entire exhibition, and I don't know why. The body may be fathomable, but this, inexplicably, is not. </p> <p>\u0095 Spectacular Bodies is at the Hayward Gallery, London SE1, until January 14. Details: 020-7261 0127.</p>",

  "By an odd twist of fate, my wife Anne and I were on our first visit to Greece when we received the sad news of the death of our friend, Pat Pottle (Obituary, October 3). <p>Pat's own links with Greece went back nearly 40 years to April 1963, when he attended the historic Marathon-to-Athens peace march which contributed so importantly to the unfreezing of political life in Greece. The march was organised by the Bertrand Russell Youth Committee for Nuclear Disarmament, which drew its inspiration from the Committee of 100, and was formed in 1962 after the Cuban missile crisis. </p> <p>Pat and all but one of the marchers - the MP, Grigoris Lambrakis, who had parliamentary immunity - were arrested. Many, including Pat, being attacked and beaten by the police. Pat responded by sitting down in the road, a tactic which Greek friends on the march told me they found novel and inspirational. </p> <p>A month later, Lambrakis was struck down by a blow to the head from an assassin on a motor tricycle, acting, it seems, on instructions from the leaders of the Greek armed forces (the events are depicted in Costa-Gavras's 1969 film film, Z). While Lambrakis's life hung in the balance, his friends phoned Russell, and Pat and his colleagues arranged for a British specialist to fly out to Greece. Unfortunately, before he could do so, Lambrakis was dead. </p> <p>But his funeral turned into the largest political demonstration in postwar Greece; Athens came to a standstill with a close to one-day general strike, and 500,000 people taking to the streets to follow the funeral cortege. </p> <p>The following month, when King Constantine and Queen Frederika paid a state visit to Britain, it was disrupted by demonstrations organised by the Committee of 100 and the ad hoc Save Greece Now Committee. </p> <p>In the subsequent Greek elections, the Centre Union Party emerged victorious, and introduced a period of political reform, only terminated by the 1967 colonels' coup. </p> <p>This was the background to the occupation of the Greek embassy in London, organised by Committee of 100 supporters. Pat was among those arrested, but he kicked open the police van at a set of traffic lights and shouted, \"Everybody out.\" Next day, he appeared in court, wearing, for once, a collar and tie, and stood bail for those of us who had not been so fortunate. </p> <p>Pat was a marvellous raconteur with a hilarious and ribald sense of humour. He could make a joke even out of his own painful experiences - as when he described, in The Blake Escape (1989), the medical examination at reception in Wormwood Scrubs. \"In full view of other prisoners, you bent over and spread your cheeks while the doctor looked up your bum. To this day, I can't imagine what he was looking for - but, whatever it was, he didn't find it on me.\" </p> <p>During our Old Bailey trial in 1991, the prosecution argued that the videotape we had made in Moscow, in which Blake confirmed our role in his escape - without the knowledge of the KGB, was irrelevant and should not be shown to the jury. Pat interrupted thus: \"It may not go towards our innocence, m' lud, but it clearly does go towards our guilt.\" The judge allowed the tape to be shown, and one of the highlights of the case was the screen appearance of Blake in the very court which had sentenced him to 42 years almost 30 years earlier. </p> <p>Pat's closing address was a direct appeal to the conscience of the jury members. They can hardly fail to have been moved by it, and I have no doubt that it was one of the factors which led to their decision to acquit us. </p> <p><b>Michael Randle</b></p>",
  "\"The 1930s were the golden age of cinema, not because of Fernandel or Sacha Guitry, but because the cinema was a closed, private and dark place where one could take girls - and I was just the right age.\" The remark was typical of the novelist and writer Jos\u00e9 Cabanis, who has died aged 78. <p>As a Catholic, he was concerned with the problems of salvation and eternity. Yet as a boy, he was fascinated by girls, and, as a man, he was preoccupied with women (and was not above mentioning that he had had his successes). He was also an intellectual, interested in theories that explain societies and interpret the individual. Yet, although aware of all that was being written about cinema in the development of mass culture, in 1974 he was still ready to explain its success by its convenience for boys looking for a place to cuddle girls. </p> <p>During the 1950s, when the French public was expected to read the nouveau roman, or new novel, which did away with stories featuring characters, Cabanis started publishing traditional novels. True, they could be described as existential, meaning that they indulged in the exploration of consciousness. </p> <p>Traditionally, the novelist presents a character who wonders when he was happy, who tries to remember a moment in childhood when a mysterious joy swept down upon him. Cabanis wrote of these feelings, but he did so like an old-fashioned novelist, telling a story, presenting characters. In all, he wrote 12 such works - one of them, Les Cartes du Temps (1963), won the booksellers' prize - and the public found it easier to read them than the nouveau roman. He also wrote against intellectual fashion with his history books. </p> <p>Contemporary writers were concerned with explaining the great movements of history in economic life and in the mentality of successive generations. But Cabanis went for traditional and glorious characters, such as Saint-Simon, who recorded life at Louis XIV's court, and Charles X, determined to be a king who ruled. </p> <p>As in everything he wrote, Cabanis had his own philosophy, which ran counter to the prevailing thought of his time. Saint-Simon did not believe that the society he observed would last; Charles X could not assume that, in 1830, he could act like the Sun King. And neither believed that this would matter in the long run. </p> <p>Born in Toulouse, Cabanis remained a Toulousain all his life. His family had practised law for three centuries, although it was widely believed that they enjoyed the privilege only for contributing to Fran\u00e7ois I's ransom after his defeat at Pavie in 1525. Cabanis was educated at a Jesuit school, then at the Toulouse lyc\u00e9e and the city's university law school. </p> <p>His diary, Les profondes ann\u00e9es (1976), records the events of the second world war, while, at the same time, expressing his love for one V\u00e9ronique. He showed a legal suspicion of the new Vichy government in 1940, when it was determined to discredit General de Gaulle and the Free French movement in London. His brother was killed fighting near Dunkirk. </p> <p>In 1943, he was among the young Frenchmen mobilised to work in Germany. He recounted his experiences of factory life, reading Montaigne and Alain in his bunk at night, discovering the beauties of the Black Forest, and looking from a distance at a nearby village, which he thought of as his own. And there was also one Anna. </p> <p>After the war, Cabanis became a lawyer, while writing at night. He had become, as he put it, the guardian of all the secrets of property and housing law. But he could equally well have spent every day with Saint-Simon. </p> <p>However, he did not always regret his past. In his last book, Lettres de la Fort Noire (Letters From The Black Forest, 2000), he imagined, as he always did, that he was a boy again, his mind filled with romance and literature. That youth would not have been ashamed at what the old man had done. On the contrary, he would have been proud. To believe that, wrote Cabanis, was to have had a good life. </p> <p>When he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1990, the speech of welcome referred to him as \"a voluptuous mystic\". Cabanis believed in the reality of sin, but he believed that a soul could save itself only in its own appointed body. In 1945, with the allied victory, he was delighted to return to France. But there was Anna. And leaving was always sad. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, son and daughter. </p> <p><b> Douglas Johnson</b> </p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Cabanis, writer and lawyer, born March 24 1922; died October 6 2000</p>",
  "There's doesn't seem to be much to Kenilworth. There's the castle, of course, but that's upstaged by the grander one in Warwick, a little way up the road. For the rest, there's a rather nondescript rabble of buildings lined up facing each other on either side of the A46, and that's about it. I could be wrong - there are probably a host of Kenilworthies ready to leap to the defence of their town - but that's how the place strikes me. So how and why Kenilworth should be home to two restaurants of serious substance is something of a mystery. One is the Restaurant Bosquet, a very French family affair, which I reviewed favourably a few years back, and the other is Simpsons, a Michelin-starred joint, where I stopped off for a solitary lunch last week. <p>People have differing views on the merits of Michelin stars, but, if nothing else, they usually guarantee that certain basic things are done correctly. Simpsons, I am happy to report, takes the principles of correctness rather beyond the basics. </p> <p>It's modern in mood, what with cream walls, tiled floor and tall mirrors in bleached oak frames, but the effect is the warm side of cool, and curious bits of fake box topiary shaped like corkscrews give the dinings rooms a bosky appeal. The menu is modern, too, specifically modern French, which comes as rather a relief after weeks of Euro-fusion. True, there was the odd Italian touch - a cep risotto and Parmesan crisp here, crab couscous there, and a cannelloni of chicken somewhere else - but the risotto and crisp were on the same plate as rabbit confit, the couscous lent support to sea bass and there was a barley and morel cream to go with the cannelloni, so the shape and feel of each dish was distinctly French. </p> <p>I had none of these dishes, preferring a chicory and asparagus salad with poached egg and walnut dressing; roast squab with braised lentils, chou-farci and jus of thyme; and a chocolate fondant with pistachio ice cream from the set-price lunch menu - two courses for \u00a315, three for \u00a320 - which offered up a choice of three dishes at each stage. As a fixed-price menu, I'd say that it was exceptionally well-conceived and generous. </p> <p>I am not sure that chicory and asparagus are on serious buddy-buddy terms, particularly as there were only about three asparagus to judge by. Asparagus is the kind of ingredient that adds an air of distinction to a dish on the menu, but is usually best eaten on its own. But I shouldn't make too much of an issue of it, because the rest of the salad was exemplary - lovely, crisp endive with a slight edge of bitterness to them offset by the blandly perfect poached egg, the aromatic walnut dressing and, unheralded, long strips of fresh Parmesan. Simple, yes, and very satisfying in a minor key. </p> <p>The squab was even better, a gentle, well-founded, well-rounded dish. The earthy grain of the lentils acted as a foil to the soft suede of the breast of roasted pigeon. The lentils themselves were made more interesting by a beautifully judged stock-based sauce, and the cabbage, stuffed with delicately sweet, saut\u00e9ed onion, was more than simply a pretty garnish. It wasn't a fancy dish, but each part of it had been precisely cooked, and the total effect would have been reduced if any of those parts had been missing. </p> <p>That left the chocolate fondant, which has become something of a staple of the restaurant pudding department. I'm sure that you've come across the kind of thing - sort of cakey/biscuity packaging for molten chocolate sauce: great portion control, delight to eat; keeps kitchen and customer happy. This one did fine, and fitted particularly well with the rest of the menu. </p> <p>So, that was \u00a320. Add \u00a314.50 for a half-bottle of pretty sumptuous Chateau La Tour du Bonnet and \u00a33 for water, and you have a total of \u00a337.50. Not a little, not a lot; a sensible price. But then, Simpsons is a sensible restaurant. It concentrates on doing the important things well. The food is conceived within sensible boundaries and is immaculately cooked. The service is charming, energetic and efficient. All are rare qualities, even in Kenilworth.</p>",
  "The parents of a 12-year-old boy with a passion for dance went to the high court yesterday in an attempt to make his local authority pay for lessons to train him in ballet. <p>In a story with echoes of the hit film Billy Elliot, Jacob Youngson started ballet classes at five, stuck with them even when his two sisters dropped out, and has performed in The Nutcracker with Birmingham Royal Ballet. After keeping his talent hidden from primary school classmates, he moved on to attend a specialist arts school, with fees of \u00a311,600 a year. </p> <p>Yesterday the boy's parents, Sarah and Keith Youngson, asked Mr Justice Scott Baker to overturn a decision by Birmingham city council to reject their application for a grant to pay the fees. </p> <p>Representing the family, who live in the Birmingham suburb of Stirchley, Ramby de Mello was not slow to draw parallels with the film. \"I wondered how long it would be before you mentioned Billy Elliot,\" replied the judge drily. </p> <p>Mrs Youngson, who cannot work because of arthritis, and her husband, a teacher, were struggling to pay fees at Elmhurst school for dance and the performing arts in Camberley, Surrey, the court was told. Mr de Mello argued that the refusal to award a discretionary grant, on the grounds that the family had failed to demonstrate \"severe financial hardship\", was irrational, and the local authority had acted outside its powers. </p> <p>He said: \"Undoubtedly here there is a young boy of considerable talent - that was not at any stage disputed.\" But his only hope of becoming a top dancer, an ambition to which he was \"committed and passionate\", was by obtaining assistance. </p> <p>The judge heard that David Bintley, artistic director of Birmingham Royal Ballet, had written to Mr and Mrs Youngson condemning public attitudes to funding young dancers, saying they threatened to deny access to a career in the arts \"to everybody except the wealthy\". </p> <p>\"Children with talent who do not have the money to afford training are falling by the wayside, and the quality of young dancers who are coming through for me to select as the director of the company is suffering,\" said Mr Bintley. He was \"personally fed up with people continually calling what I do an elitist occupation, only for the rich\". </p> <p>Clive Sheldon, for Birmingham city council, said that it was not a question of ballet being seen as elitist; the city was under no legal obligation to provide the boy with a grant, and in its view he did not merit one when there was not an unlimited supply. The boy had auditioned for a government-funded assisted place but did not get one, Mr Sheldon continued. \"One could only speculate that there were other, better candidates. [The city] exercised its discretion rationally, in accordance with the law, and with due regard to any issues under the Human Rights Act.\" </p> <p>The parents had failed to demonstrate that all appropriate alternative sources of funding had been exhausted, said Mr Sheldon, or that their son could not achieve academic and dance qualifications while at a mainstream school. </p> <p>Outside court, Mrs Youngson said she and her husband found money for the fees by \"borrowing and going without\". Her son had had to struggle against prejudice and bullying, she added. \"He kept his dancing secret all through primary school. It was really around the time that the council made its decision that it came out. There does seem to be this prejudice surrounding male dancers, but he is willing to fight against it.\" </p> <p>Reserving judgment, the judge said he would consider his decision. Jacob has also reserved judgment on Billy Elliot: he is too young to see it.</p>",
  "All new cars and houses will soon come with labels telling the purchaser how fuel efficient they are, so buyers can check on the costs they face and how much environmental damage they are doing. <p>Cars already have to be labelled for fuel consumption and soon will have an assessment of carbon dioxide emissions, but in future there will be figures for similar models for comparison. </p> <p>From January 2001 new houses will have energy efficiency labels similar to those already attached to washing machines, freezers, and other \"white\" household goods. </p> <p>The labels run from A to G, A being the most efficient, and are to comply with European Union directives to improve energy efficiency and consumer choice. </p> <p>Yesterday the government's advisory committee on consumer products recommended that all products be labelled in the same way. </p> <p>The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders supports the call for energy efficiency labelling, since it sees extra miles per litre as a selling point.</p>",
  "An ingredient found in some of the UK's leading over-the-counter cold remedies may be linked to increased risk of stroke, according to evidence from the Yale School of Medicine in the United States. <p>The Food and Drugs Administration, which licences medicines in the US, has been advised by its expert panel that the ingredient, phenylpropanolamine (PPA), cannot be \"generally recognised as safe\" any longer. </p> <p>The FDA is now considering whether to instruct manufacturers of cold remedies and appetite suppressants to withdraw their products from the market. </p> <p>PPA is used in some of the leading UK products bought from the high street chemist for colds, congestion and hayfever, including Benylin Day and Night Cold Treatment, Day Nurse, Contac 400 and Mu-Cron and Sinutab tablets. </p> <p>Yesterday the Medicines Control Agency, which licences drugs in the UK, said it was aware of the new evidence linking PPA to stroke. \"The committee on the safety of medicines will review the evidence and make recommendations to the MCA,\" it said in a statement. </p> <p>The Yale study was funded by a trade group representing over-the-counter manufacturers. This group, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, is now leading the attack on its findings, claiming the number of patients who took products containing PPA was small and that some were at risk of stroke for other reasons, such as smoking. </p> <p>But the study is in line with other research going back 20 years, suggesting there might be problems with PPA. It showed that people aged 18 to 49 who took PPA had a small increased risk of stroke. </p> <p>The British trade organisation, the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, emphasised the differences between US and UK use of PPA. Products in the US can contain 150mg of the chemical, but the MCA restricted British products to 100mg in 1985, because of concerns at that time. </p> <p>PPA is used in cold and hay fever remedies, but not in appetite suppressants - aimed at people trying to diet - in the UK, and the products therefore are only for short-term use, said the PAGB. </p> <p>\"There is no reliable evidence of a causal link between PPA and stroke if the product is used at doses approved in the UK according to the label instructions,\" said a statement. </p> <p>\"Millions of doses of PPA have been taken safely and effectively in the UK for the relief of cold symptoms. However, it has been recognised for some time that overdose of PPA can increase blood pressure, which is known to increase the risk of stroke. </p> <p>\"All labels of products containing PPA clearly say that if you are taking prescribed medicines you should consult your doctor or pharmacist.\" </p> <p>Anyone with any concerns should speak to their doctor or their pharmacist, the PAGB said. </p> <p>Products known to contain PPA in the UK are: Aller-eze Plus, Benylin Day and Night Cold Treatment, Contac 400, Day Nurse, Day Nurse capsules, Dimotapp (Elixir, Paediatric and LA tablets), Mu-Cron tablets, Sunutab tablets, Triogesic tablets and Tiomini tablets. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Public Citizen, a watchdog body in the US, has petitioned the FDA for an immediate ban on use of PPA in over-the-counter products. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's health research group, said there was \"a long history of published serious adverse events including haemorrhagic strokes attributed to PPA going back to 1979.\" </p> <p>The chemical can cause cerebral vasculitis, a severe inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain, said Dr Wolfe.</p>",
  "The most interesting aspect of the Gerald Corbett discussion is the framing of the question: should Gerald Corbett go now or retain his job (Letters, October 20)? Put this way, the answers are easy - he should stay because we do not have full information and we need him to sort things out. But such a narrow question closes out other options offering more accountability. Mr Corbett should have been given three months to take remedial steps and report back.

  "The way we behave in our working lives reflects what we perceive and what we believe. As the interplay between values and value creation edges further into the spotlight, companies aspiring to world-class ethical behaviour must get a grip on what their own employees think, perceive and believe. Worryingly, a recent survey of more than 3,000 employees of US companies with a staggering 78% response raises some major questions. <p>In its 2000 Organizational Integrity Survey, KPMG notes that: \"One of the greatest risks to success in business is improper or unauthorized corporate or employee conduct. Failure to manage this risk can result in serious harm to the organization... the marketplace rewards companies that employ effective business integrity standards and punishes those that do not.\" </p> <p>At least, that's the theory. Some of the survey results are disturbing. Employees are seeing a surprisingly high level of unethical (even illegal) conduct; misconduct tends to be of a serious nature; companies are making matters worse by sending the wrong messages to employees on how to meet their goals; management is seen as unable or unwilling to deal with unethical conduct and employees are discouraged from reporting it. </p> <p>The three warning signals highlighted by KPMG are: 76% of employees say they have seen violations of the law in the last 12 months. Nearly half, 49%, say the violations are sufficiently serious for their employer to \"significantly lose public trust\". The nature of the violation varies, with falsification of financial data most likely in accounting (18%), vi olations of privacy rights in the human resources area (38%), unsafe working conditions (56%) and environmental breaches (31%) in manufacturing. </p> <p>Why are these problems occuring? The most common reasons given were cynicism and low morale (73%), followed by pressure to meet schedules (70%), pressure to hit unrealistic earnings goals (65%), desire to advance careers (56%), inadequate training (50%) and desire to steal from - or harm - the company (22%). </p> <p>Anyone believing in the capacity of top people to sort these things out overnight may be interested to learn that 57% of respondents think their CEOs and other senior executives are igno rant of the problem, 58% say they are unapproachable if an employee wants to deliver bad news, and 38% fear they would actually authorise the illegal or unethical conduct to meet business goals. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents (61%) feel that senior management would fail to discipline offenders regardless of rank, even if the news did get through. </p> <p>What can be done? The most popular answers point to incentives and rewards for sticking to company standards (51%), stronger top management commitment and more time (both 50%), stronger support for those raising ethical questions (48%), increased communication and training (46%), more realistic earnings goals (38%), increased oversight by the board (37%) and better policies and procedures (36%). Tighter auditing and controls came bottom (28%). </p> <p>The upside of good organisational integrity includes an enhanced ability to attract good employees (only 21% of those working for the worst companies would recommend them to potential recruits against 81% in good companies).

  "Shortly after noon on July 26, 1994, under a prickly lunch-time sun, a smartly-dressed woman \"of Mediterranean appearance\" drove a grey Audi through the police checkpoints at Kensington Palace Gardens, along the dappled and guarded tunnel of trees that is London's main diplomatic quarter, and parked a car bomb next to the Israeli embassy. The security cameras on the embassy lawn and the listening devices in the branches high above quickly picked her up. One of the embassy's grey-suited guards, who cluster and stare and fidget outside its gates, asked a nearby armed policeman of the diplomatic protection corps to challenge her. <p>She told the officer she was visiting some flats next door, but that she had to go to the end of the road first, to busy Kensington High Street, to buy some cigarettes. A few seconds after she disappeared from view, in her navy jacket and skirt and matching sandals, swinging a Harrods bag, the bomb detonated. The car was thrown 50 feet; the embassy, which is built of heavy blood-red brick, lost part of its south wing. A witness in a hotel room some distance away described seeing debris rise a hundred feet above the treetops. Thirteen people were injured. The explosive was estimated as weighing 30 pounds, but the police never found a speck. </p> <p>That night, shortly after midnight, someone parked another car five miles to the north. The North Finchley High Road was quietening down: the pubs had cleared out, a few people were waiting at bus stops. Balfour House, a long, dirty, cream office building above a barber's and a shoe shop, was the second target. Behind its blinds and blank facade, it housed the London offices of, among others, the Jewish Agency for Israel, the Joint Israel Appeal and the World Zionist Organisation. A special Balfour House police unit was patrolling \"away from\" the block when the second bomb went off. The building had been strengthened against attack with slits and double doors - much of the blast blew back off its facade. Bus stops shattered and windows launched glass splinters across a quarter of a mile of a shaken-awake suburb. Six more people were injured; another burnt car chassis, this time the remains of a red Triumph Acclaim, was recovered. </p> <p>The outline of an explanation soon appeared. Just before the bombs, it was noted, the then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had shaken hands at the White House with King Hussein of Jordan. It was a year after the launch of the Oslo peace process, that was to edge along for six more years until it was halted so bloodily on the streets of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel this month. Soon after the explosions in London, a previously unknown body called the \"Jaffa Unit\" or \"Jaffa Team\" of the \"Palestinian Resistance\" said it had caused them. The motive, it was assumed, was some furious objection from Palestinians to the settlement being negotiated between their leader, Yasser Arafat, and Israel. </p> <p>Starting in January 1995, six Palestinians who lived in Britain were arrested. In October 1996, four of them were put on trial: three for \"conspiring to cause explosions\" in Britain between 1993 and 1995 (no mention was made of the actual bombings), and one for driving the Audi to the embassy. In December 1996, two of the defendants, Samar Alami and Jawad Botmeh, were convicted of the conspiracy charge. The other two were released. Alami and Botmeh were sentenced to 20 years in prison as Category A inmates, the most dangerous rating, followed by deportation. It was an unusually fierce penalty for the crime: a man found guilty of plotting to bomb the Syrian embassy in London the year before had got seven years. </p> <p> This Tuesday at the Court of Appeal, after weeks of violent confrontation between the Palestinians and Israel, Alami and Botmeh are to be judged again. Belatedly, they have been granted an appeal against their convictions. Even four years ago, though, the evidence against them seemed start-lingly incomplete. </p> <p>Nevertheless, after they were convicted, the press gave Alami, then a 31-year-old engineering student, and Botmeh, then a 29- year-old entrepreneur of erratic success, the stereotypical profile of devious Arab terrorists in the west. They \"had used their student status in the United Kingdom as a cover\"; they had \"acquired scientific expertise at British universities to make bombs\"; they were \"salon revolutionaries\", \"the offspring of elite families\", \"on the surface a charming and sophisticated pair with some influential friends\". </p> <p>They had both been politically active in Britain for years, campaigning against the illegal Israeli occupation and oppression in the Palestinian territories. In the mid-90s, as now, there was rising official anxiety - with accompanying anti-terrorism legislation - about foreigners plotting political violence from British boltholes. Yet Alami and Botmeh hardly seemed convincing as master terrorists. When they were first arrested and questioned, they did not provide alibis, the first defence of any properly prepared criminal. They insisted they could not remember where they were when the bombs were planted. And the two central pieces of evidence against them also suggested amateurism, rather than the expertise surely needed to attack outposts of one the world's most paranoid and well-defended nations. The Audi containing the Kensington Palace Gardens bomb had been traced back to Botmeh: he had bought the car with another man at a car auction, but arrived in a highly noticeable white vintage BMW. And bomb-making equipment had been discovered in a small storage locker near Heathrow airport rented by Alami and Botmeh; but the locker only came to light, and its contents discovered, because the pair had failed to keep up the rent. </p> <p>Both of them, just as puzzlingly, had also failed to take any of their plentiful opportunities to escape. Six months went by between the bombs and their arrest, and months more passed when they were out on bail before the trial. They travelled extensively, even abroad, but they always returned to Britain. </p> <p>The trial had its mysteries, too. In his summing-up, the judge described the 10 weeks at the Old Bailey as \"rather like trying to get a firm grip on a piece of soap in the bath\". The explosives in the Heathrow locker turned out to be too unstable and out of condition to have been used in car bombs. A map of north Finchley from a notebook of Alami's, triumphantly flourished by the prosecution, turned out to be a map of Sidon, a coastal town in Lebanon, drawn by her sister when visiting friends there. An application form found at Alami's flat in west London to join a Palestinian organisation with supposed terrorist connections turned out to be seven years old, filled in but unsent, and to refer to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a party that had renounced violence abroad since the late 70s. Yawns were spotted among the jury. An Israeli journalist was caught talking to jury members, and trying to give out a telephone number. He was seen holding his nose and scowling in court while defence witnesses gave evidence. One of these was Botmeh himself: he brought a radio- controlled model aircraft of his to court, and outlined a bizarre scheme to fly homemade explosives and medical supplies, in defiance of Israeli troops, over Gaza and the West Bank. He sounded more like a fantasist than a terrorist. </p> <p>The jury convicted him and Alami by 11 to one regardless. But the whole truth of the bombings remained elusive. For one thing, the woman \"of Mediterranean appearance\", who was too old to be Alami, has never been traced. Nor has anyone else been convicted of planting either of the bombs. And no apparent effort has been made since the trial - by the British or the Israelis - to secure these goals. All a spokesman for the Israeli embassy will say on the matter is: \"Given the fact that two of their [the bombers'] cronies are in jail, that's probably taken the wind out of their sails.\" </p> <p>In fact, such a tidy end to the affair has seemed steadily less likely. Instead, the avowed innocence of Samar Alami and Jawad Botmeh, and the alleged responsibility for the London bombs of others - less convenient for the Israelis - have become a cause. \"Samar and Jawad\" has become a phrase on badges and T-shirts, on the lips of traditional parliamentary campaigners (Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn), and less expected ones (the Tory ex-minister and peer Lord Gilmour), at the top of a petition that has attracted 200,000 signatures in the West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon, and in the Palestinian legislature, where more than 60 members have offered support. Amnesty International has \"concerns that the charges may have been politically motivated\". Gareth Peirce, who demolished the convictions of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four, is acting as Alami and Botmeh's solicitor. And, perhaps most suggestively of all, there have been repeated claims ever since the bombings, from Arab and Israeli diplomats and the Jewish Board of Deputies in London, that warnings they had given MI5 about imminent attacks on Jewish targets in Britain were ignored. Alami and Botmeh, their advocates say, were arrested and convicted purely to save face for the security services. </p> <p>All evidence concerning them and the bombings was made officially secret in March 1999. A Public Interest Immunity Certificate cloaks it: neither Peirce, nor the equally revered human-rights barrister Michael Mansfield, who will be representing Alami and Botmeh in the High Court, have access. \"To exonerate them,\" says Peirce, \"we have in effect to prove who did it.\" Their supporters' theories sometimes favour Iran, an enemy of Israel at the time, and sometimes - pointing to the mysterious ease of the attacks, the absence of important embassy staff at the time, the relative lightness of the casualties - even the Israelis themselves. No film of the embassy assault has ever been recovered from its security cameras. All the debris was allegedly collected from the crater by Israeli officials in a hurry. </p> <p>At this point, the speculations enter a hall of mirrors. Were the Israelis trying to demonstrate their vulnerability to assault in Britain? Was there some internal Israeli feud going on? Or were the bombs meant to smear the Palestinian cause? The embassy spokesman calls such suggestions \"heinous\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, Alami and Botmeh have spent half a decade in British prisons convicted of a crime that can seem as vague and hard to deny, at times, as the descending cloud of accusations in Kafka's The Trial. Yet even Peirce admits that their experiments with explosives came \"close to a line\", between legitimate activism and something perhaps less so, \"which they never should have ventured near\". </p> <p>Botmeh is currently serving his sentence as far away as possible, it seems, from the scene of the explosions and the homes of his supporters. On the edge of Durham, among fields he never sees, Frankland prison is a hilltop stockade of floodlights and barking police dogs. On a rare sunny day, if you squint, it could be a Palestinian refugee camp - or an Israeli settler compound - on the West Bank. </p> <p>But Botmeh, who has not been interviewed by a British newspaper before, comes to the visiting room as if dressed for Friday at a firm of management consultants. He wears a Ralph Lauren rugby shirt, gold wire-rimmed glasses, pressed jeans and shoes of some softness and elegance. He is quite tall and toned-up, and carries a plastic folder under one arm. He sits down quickly, opens it, and marks the points he wishes to emphasise with brisk waves of a pencil. </p> <p>\"We know that the Israelis know I didn't do it,\" he begins, bright-eyed and crisp. \"The Israelis know me. They know my views. I spoke to lots of Jewish students here when I was a student activist.\" He bobs a foot with impatience at it all. \"The danger to the public from the bombers is still there. I want the police to go out looking, and they're not.\" He stills his foot and looks up from his file: \"These bombs were actually the worst thing that could have happened to the Palestinians since the [terrorist] events of the early 70s. In a different era, under different circumstances, we have struggled to establish to the world that we have a cause ... The bombings are totally counter-productive.\" The only beneficiaries, he says, have been Israelis of an unbending and suspicious disposition. \"Two sensible Palestinians have been put away.\" </p> <p>Botmeh came to Britain to do A-levels. That was in 1985, when he was 17; he had already graduated with honours from a private school in Bethlehem, his home town in the West Bank. He has lived in Britain ever since, acquiring degrees in electronic engineering from Leicester University and King's College, London, and intermittently trying to establish an export business, for trade in essential supplies with the Occupied Territories, called Keeton. He is married to an English woman called Elizabeth, whose father \"is a retired policeman\", we learn in Alami and Botmeh's campaign booklet. </p> <p> Beneath such well-groomed details, though, Botmeh has lived more painfully at times. \"I was beaten by soldiers at demonstrations when I was 13 or 14,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"And coming back from school. I remember once an Israeli jeep just stopped me and two other kids. The others ran off home, but the soldiers hit me with the butts of their rifles. They slapped me in the face. I was cowering on the floor. You dare not move ...\" He stands up in the tiny visiting room, as a warder paces outside each of its windows, and mimes a raised foot. \"They keep you there. Every 15 seconds, you get a blow.\" </p> <p>At Leicester University, he set up a Palestinian Society, and entered an exile world of long meetings and cold marches, Saturdays lost to conferences, endless letters sent to pin-prick consciences. The Palestinian diaspora in Britain gathers in borrowed churches and talk-heated halls, on barely reported vigils. The men, like Botmeh, do not look as activists are supposed to: they wear blazers and loafers and the expressions of careful businessmen. The women carry banners with the names of demolished Palestinian villages in impeccable letters. Everyone seems to know everyone. Everywhere there are maps of tiny slivers of territory, currently occupied or surrounded by the Israelis. \"Why would I, or Samar, ever get involved in student politics . . . and spend years campaigning peacefully,\" asks Botmeh crossly in the campaign pamphlet, \"if what we really wanted to do was use violence against Israelis in London?\" When did he first hear about the embassy bomb? He pauses, then says slowly: \"On the news at around one o'clock, on the car radio.\" What was his immediate reaction? A longer pause. \"Difficult to say ... surprised ... um ... to tell you the truth, surprised and anxious. So close to Kensington High Street - my uncle could have been passing.\" </p> <p>It took a year to establish, at least to Peirce's satisfaction, exactly what Botmeh was doing on the day of the first explosion. By sifting through mobile phone records, she traced him to Sussex; he finally remembered that he had been looking for a language school for his younger brother. Alami's memory was even vaguer - she says she still cannot account for the whole day - but the telephone archives again showed that she had been talking to her sister-in-law, from a callbox outside the library of Imperial College in London, when the bomb went off. \"I was trying to start my thesis,\" says Alami. \"I had just got back from holiday in France, and had found something interesting from 1937 to do with [my subject] water in Palestine. I heard like a loud thud. I thought it was the IRA, to be honest.\" </p> <p>She is sitting in another tight fishbowl of a visitors' room, in Holloway prison, north London. She is as elegantly turned out as Botmeh, in pink jeans and a slim cream blouse, but she has more of a jail-cell pallor. Unlike him, however, she alternates almost casual recollections with sad-eyed hints at something more despairing. </p> <p>\"Frankly, I would rather not have my name in the paper at all,\" she says quietly, arms folded. She came to Britain from Lebanon in 1984 for a quiet life. Her father was the head of the Arab Bank in Beirut, and her mother had been a pioneering female university graduate there, but Britain felt more stable. \"This country was civilised to us until the bombings, and we were to it. This is not a frontline. If I'd felt frustrated and wanted more direct action, I could have gone back to south Lebanon.\" When she belatedly heard the embassy had been attacked, she says, some time much later that hot afternoon in 1994, she just felt queasy. \"An Arab friend of mine from Bayswater said, 'Everybody is going to be rounded up.' I remember someone else saying, 'Where are we going to picket now?' \" </p> <p>Until then, Alami had followed a similar trajectory to Botmeh in Britain, of protest and professional advancement. She obtained degrees in chemical engineering from University and Imperial Colleges in London, and was writing her thesis to conclude a third, in water resources management, at nearby City University. She was strenuously involved in Palestinian student politics. \"You can't really switch off as a Palestinian,\" she says. Just claiming your identity is a political act - with consequences. A common estimate of the proportion of Palestinians who have been arrested by the Israelis in the Occupied Territories, at some point since these lands' seizure in 1967, is one in three. </p> <p>Alami first met Botmeh through activism in 1990, the year he began going out with Elizabeth. Alami and Botmeh became comrades and close friends. Even after four years in prison, even on matters of minor West Bank doctrine, it seems difficult to separate them. And in 1992, they both agree, they met the man who may have bound them together permanently. The man, they say, who bought the Audi with Botmeh. Who persuaded them to store explosives for him. Who set them up. And who has since disappeared with complete efficiency. </p> <p>It was first at a lecture in London on the Middle East that Alami says she encountered someone calling himself Rida Mughrabi, or Reda Moghrabi - the spelling seems as slippery as his precise identity, and the name was most likely false. He was middle-aged and \"engaging\", with a clean-cut jaw and heavy eyebrows. He claimed to be a West Bank exile who had fought the Israelis in southern Lebanon during the early 80s. He had subsequently lived in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and was now in Birmingham. He said he had fallen out with both Arafat and Arafat's opponents. He seemed to know a great deal about surveillance techniques, survival on the battlefield, and how to improvise explosives. \"We saw him at meetings and lectures at the School of Oriental and African Studies [in London],\" says Botmeh. \"We would go for a cup of coffee afterwards. What he said rang true.\" Did they wonder at all why this mentor had suddenly appeared? Botmeh sounds even crisper than usual: \"I wasn't going to be his best friend. I didn't scrutinise every word he said.\" Alami has a more nuanced explanation. \"In London, so many [Arab] people are coming and going. You don't check people's ID, check things out.\" </p> <p>In 1993, Botmeh did Mughrabi a favour. As a hobby and a way of making money - Botmeh's export business was struggling, and he did not have a permanent job - he had been going to car auctions for years with friends and acquaintances, and offering his experienced judgement on secondhand vehicles for a small commission. That year, he took Mughrabi to an auction in Northampton; Mughrabi bought a Renault 25. The following year, six weeks before the bombings, Mughrabi got in touch again: could Botmeh help him buy another Renault? They drove to Northampton the same day, yet this time they couldn't find anything satisfactory for the \u00a31,000 Mughrabi wanted to spend. But he was determined; the next day they went to a Milton Keynes auction instead, in Botmeh's garish white BMW, and bought the Audi. </p> <p>The Israeli embassy says that almost all of this is fiction. Botmeh helped buy the Audi, they agree, but as for Mughrabi - \"I've never seen anything proving that he existed,\" says a spokesman. At the trial, the judge appeared to share these doubts. Mughrabi may have been \"a fictitious character\", he speculated, \"carefully tailored to fit those parts of the Crown's case for which there is no answer.\" </p> <p>Yet Botmeh's signature and fingerprints were not found on the Audi's purchase documents. Instead, there were those of another man, who gave his name, almost certainly falsely, as George Davies. A man of the same name had also bought another car two days before, on his own this time, at an auction in Birmingham. It was the red Triumph Acclaim used to blow up Balfour House. </p> <p>That attack, like the embassy's, had a carefully-planned quality. A week before, a car bomb had disembowelled the offices of a Jewish charity in Argentina, leaving more than 250 casualties. The World Jewish Congress in New York had called on all Jewish institutions to take extra precautions. Balfour House, although it sits amid the usual outer London hum and bustle, has tank traps outside disguised as flower-tubs. Even today, six years after the explosions, if you stand on the pavement nearby for more than a few seconds, a lean man in a blue blazer may ask you what you are up to. He has a dry voice, and is polite. If you are lingering near the local travel agent's, for example, he may first enquire about your holiday plans. But he does not introduce himself, and his blazer is slightly too big and boxy to conceal only a wallet. If he stops you again, he will ask for your credentials, and take them, and get someone else to call your boss with less polite questions, this time about your precise reasons for being on a public street in North Finchley in broad daylight. </p> <p>In June 1994, as well as buying the cars for the attacks, \"George Davies\" also seems to have bought a decoy. That month, he collected chemicals that could be used in bomb- making from an industrial supplier in Birmingham. Birmingham, conveniently, is where Alami and Botmeh say Mughrabi was operating at the time; and these were the chemicals that ended up in their storage locker. </p> <p>It seems a clever set-up. Just as Mughrabi used Botmeh's obsessive car-buying to incriminate him, so Mughrabi used the two Palestinians' political frustrations to make them look like terrorists. Or so their defence goes. During 1993, they say, their mentor began openly discussing ways of violently resisting the Israelis in the Occupied Territories. They had been edging in the same direction, trying to think of ways they could help Palestinians there to defend themselves. \"It was a very uncertain time,\" says Alami. \"This was the aftermath of the Gulf War [when Saddam Hussein fired missiles at Israel and attracted popular Palestinian support]. There was an argument about which direction to take.\" </p> <p>Using nail varnish remover, hair dye and other household products to make explosives, and Botmeh's boyish expertise with radio-controlled model aircraft to carry them, Alami and Botmeh had been dreaming up plans for buzzing squadrons to aid besieged villages on the West Bank. The trouble was, none of it worked. Their \"experiments\" flopped in the pouring rain in an empty corner of the Derbyshire Peak District. </p> <p> The precise motivation and extent of these \"experiments\", however, has been a problem for Alami and Botmeh's defence ever since. \"Me and Samar were in London thinking, 'How can we help?' \" says Botmeh. \"The planes were a hobby. People would say, 'Could you put a camera in it? Could this be used back home?' Had we succeeded, we might have passed the information back.\" He pauses. His foot jogs. \"Our intention wasn't to harm anybody, here or back home.\" </p> <p>Alami seems more regretful. \"It's very difficult to show what we were thinking.\" A month before the bombings, she says Mughrabi called her, said he was leaving the country, and asked her to look after two boxes of ingredients for explosives. She met him in London and took them: \"I was working against my instinct. I thought things were going to go wrong within an hour of him giving them.\" She did not see him again. When, later, she re-read all her notebooks and pamphlets, all the activist ephemera that would help convict her, there was not a scrap she could pin to Mughrabi. </p> <p>At the trial, \"The jury completely blanked out after they admitted to the experiments\", says Daniel Guedalla, one of the organisers of Alami and Botmeh's campaign. Alami herself describes a sort of helpless panic overcoming her about the explosives once the embassy and Balfour House had been assaulted. \"We didn't know what to do ... Things were moving faster than we thought, and we got entangled. Jawad was under surveillance. We had things that we didn't have an explanation for.\" She stares at her hands. </p> <p>In another small stuffy room, Peirce's attic office in north London, their solicitor looks a little pained when she discusses the locker and its contents. \"There was considerable anger against Samar and Jawad from the Palestinian community, for having been so foolish,\" says Peirce, in her small, intense voice. To most English ears, their behaviour probably sounds even worse: \"These are the hardest cases for a jury here to disentangle,\" she continues, a little lined and tired, squeezed beneath a mantelpiece of invitations to receptions for unpopular causes. \"An English jury does not share the interests, the background, or the political point of view of the defendants.\" </p> <p>This time, for their appeal, Alami and Botmeh are before three judges. Much of the evidence that might clear them is still secret. Mughrabi only lives for certain in their words, despite advertisements and photofits that they placed last year in Arab newspapers. One of Alami and Botmeh's oldest supporters puts their chances as \"sixty-forty against\". </p> <p>Perhaps their best chance went at the trial. Then, the spindly case against them had to be made. Now they have to prove a negative. And it suits many interests for them to fail, for the unfathomable waters that Alami and Botmeh entered, by accident or intent, to remain just that. \"The security services,\" says Lord Gilmour, a former defence minister with a world-weary look, sitting in an ancient chair in the House of Lords, \"are more interested in covering their embarrassments than seeing justice.\" </p> <p>This may have crueller and crueller consequences. As Peirce puts it, \"The more there are prosecutions vis-a-vis political situations abroad, the more this difficulty [of Alami and Botmeh's] is going to arise - that only the security services hold the facts which might clear them, and they consider it their job not to tell.\" </p> <p>Botmeh's sister, Samia, put it more concretely, one grey Saturday last month, as the Palestinian demonstration she was on chanted its way past Downing Street. If her brother and Alami's activities, however distantly they seemed linked to the events at the embassy and Balfour House, could be grounds for 20 years in prison, \"Anyone on this march could be arrested.\" Unless, perhaps, they were a man called Mughrabi, or a woman with a Harrods bag.</p>",

The winner, Steve McQueen, is black; and so is Younge. </p> <p>\"In retrospect,\" Younge wrote angrily about the woman's gaffe a few days later, \"I could have cleaned up with some great one-liners. 'Yes, that's right, but I must go now because I've got to read the news.'\" (At the same party, incidentally, I mistook the deputy editor of the Times Literary Supplement for someone else entirely, and with such frank stupidity that I still wake up at night screaming about it. But did I make the mistake because both men were white? I doubt it.) </p> <p>That kind of thing is one sort of British racism; not exactly malevolent, but unthinking and with consequences unimaginable to the perpetrator, who hardly suspects offence has been given. In America, things are different. In this book Younge reports his travels in the South, following the route of the Freedom Riders. In the same year that Younge's mother came to England from Barbados, they challenged the segregation laws by taking the bus from Washington to New Orleans - that, at least, was the plan - and not sitting in the seats that their race demanded they sit in. Federal law on segregation had been changed in 1960; the news had yet to penetrate below the Mason-Dixon Line. </p> <p>The idea of retracing the route is a great one, urgent and necessary; and Younge is the writer to do it, although being a black Englishman is, for many Americans, bizarre to the point of being a category error. Younge gets some good laughs out of this, without milking it. A graduate in French and Russian, he is asked to speak in the latter tongue to impress a group of parents at an all-black school. \"What do you want me to say?\" he replies. \"Damn, did you hear that?\" asks someone. \"How the hell do you get to speak languages like that?\" \"It took me a couple of seconds,\" writes Younge, \"to realise that they thought I had been speaking Russian.\" Before leaving for the States, he is told by an American journalist that when his compatriots hear him speak, they'll add 20 points to his IQ; but, following the argument of the dreadful Bell Curve, they'll knock off 15 points when they see him (which, Younge concludes, still leaves him five points ahead). </p> <p>I don't think his anomalous circumstances (for Americans) throw the curve of his investigations. Filtering one kind of reaction through another actually helps the white reader get at the essence of racism in a way he or she might not have done, or would have found too uncomfortable to deal with, had Younge set his book in the UK. For this is, in his (and our) tacit comparisons on the subject, already a meditation on being black in this country. Most salutary is the way he defends crucial aspects of American life, in the way that liberals over here tend not to (the line that goes \"race relations are much better here because blacks can date whites much more easily than in America\" is not really satisfactory). Had he grown up in America, his role models could have been \"anyone from Michael Jordan to Henry Louis Gates Jr ... whereas in Britain we had to pick between Frank Bruno, Lenny Henry and Trevor McDonald\". This book is a necessary rebuke to native liberal smugness, but delivered with wit, gentle persistence and a respect for history. It could become a classic.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Chester Himes: A Life</strong></p> <p> James Sallis</p> <p> 370pp, Payback Press</p> <p> \u00a318.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502429834,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> If Chester Himes hadn't existed, James Sallis might have had to invent him. This new biography is the fascinating culmination of Sallis's longstanding admiration for \"a novelist in whom autobiography and fiction are inextricably and often maddeningly intertwined\", a genius who, 16 years after his death, still defies easy definition. Sallis is concerned to show how and where Himes's creative work connects with his life, rather than providing new revelations about a life sensational enough without extra embellishment. </p> <p>Himes was born in 1909 in Jefferson City, Missouri, across the street from the Lincoln Institute where his parents taught. His dark-skinned father could not live up to the aspirations of his light-bright-and-damn-near-white mother (who looked \"like a white woman who had suffered a long siege of illness\"), and the family constantly moved in search of better prospects, particularly after one brother was blinded in an explosion. At 16, while doing temporary work in a hotel, Chester fell 40ft down a lift shaft, shattering his teeth, breaking both arms and fracturing vertebrae. After months in hospital, he went on to attend Ohio State University. Then, against the background of bitter, violent parental quarrels, Chester began a spree of delinquency. Brothels, bars, gambling, rakish clothes and tough-guy postures became his style. He was headed straight for jail. In 1929, aged 19, he was sent to the Ohio State Penitentiary for armed robbery. By the time of his release, at the age of 26, he had become a writer, with stories appearing in Esquire and other prestigious outlets. </p> <p>His first novel, If He Hollers Let Him Go (1945), was fuelled by all the anger, fear and violence of the American racial war, as was The Lonely Crusade (1947). A novel of prison life, Cast the First Stone, appeared in 1952, so cut by its publishers as to be unrecognisable. The US was not doing right by Himes. His early marriage (to \"the most beautiful brownskin girl I had ever seen\") was over. He lost himself in sex (with white women) and drunkenness. In April 1953, he left for Paris. </p> <p>In Europe he began a new phase: new relationships, a new genre of work. A brief return to New York a couple of years later in pursuit of another doomed interracial affair proved a mistake, but provided indelible impressions to be mined later. Visiting Harlem with writer George Lamming (Barbadian, rather than Jamaican as asserted), Himes discovered \"that I still liked black people and felt exceptionally good among them, warm and happy. I dug the brothers' gallows humor and was turned on by the black chicks. I felt at home and I could have stayed there for ever if I didn't have to go out into the white world to earn my living\". </p> <p>The books with which he was about to earn that living were nine novels known as the Harlem cycle, at once funny and violent, featuring ace black detectives Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones. In a 1970 interview Himes would claim that a major motivation was to force white Americans to confront the horror and brutalisation of the black ghettos - a reprise of the epigraph to Blind Man With a Pistol (1969): \"'Blink once, you're robbed,' Coffin Ed advised the white man slumming in Harlem. 'Blink twice, you're dead,' Grave Digger added dryly.\" Yet Himes also claimed: \"The Harlem of my books was never meant to be real; I never called it real; I just wanted to take it away from the white man, if only in my books.\" </p> <p>Sallis is not intimidated. His triumph lies in a complete mastery of the Himes oeuvre, enabling him to perform intertextual surgery on a body of work comprising a score of novels, some 60 short stories and a two-volume autobiography. The details of Himes's life, it emerges, are often multiple-choice. \"The biographer, sorting his notecards, attributing motive and design in retrospect, proceeds at peril.\" Wary of \"facts\", Sallis is assured on texts, sussing out Himes's mix-and-match techniques, outing the fictive and autobiographical avatars, the facsimiles, alter egos and surrogates. But paralleling the twists and turns of Himes's literary career are the contortions of his private life, the affairs that spanned melodrama and incongruity (including a Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-type trip to Westphalia to visit the bemused parents of a German girlfriend). </p> <p>\"Realism and absurdity are so similar in the lives of American blacks one cannot tell the difference,\" Himes wrote in the second volume of his autobiography, My Life of Absurdity. (His widow Lesley has spoken of her role as editor as well as typist: \"I'd take the manuscript back and say, 'Chester, this wasn't like that...') Or as Ishmael Reed put it: \"So this is what we want: to sabotage history. They won't know whether we're serious or whether we are writing fiction ... Always keep them guessing.\" </p> <p>Hindsight can make one disingenuous. Sallis writes: \"One forever wonders what might have happened had Himes's books been published with proper timeliness, The Third Generation, for instance, a decade later, in the midst of the civil rights movement. Or The Primitive not in oblivious 1956 but in, say, 1986, when an audience, one responding to work by such as Maya Angelou, Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, existed.\" Surely the civil-rights and women's movements affected the choices of publishers: an audience can only respond to what is presented to them, and how. </p> <p>Sallis's close textual approach makes the critical paraphernalia seem wanting. There is no chronology. Notes refer to publications not in the bibliography. Works by Chester Himes are listed with inconsistent information, original or out-of-print editions given rather than current publishers, or vice versa. Let me declare an interest: I published several Himes titles in the 1980s, and nowhere is it mentioned that Cast the First Stone, The End of a Primitive, Pinktoes and Run Man Run are still available from Allison &amp; Busby. </p> <p>Occasionally, as a black person, I found this biography uncomfortable reading. Why do I feel uneasy at Sallis's assertion that \"Negroes in America had in fact developed dissembling - saying one thing and meaning another - into an art\"? But on the whole, he carries it off with brio and sensitivity. Biographer and subject are well matched. Sallis is the author of a series of books featuring a black detective, Lew Griffin, who himself writes detective stories, the first-person narrative allowing a deliberate blurring of the truth - the writer as character, the character as writer. Sallis acknowledges: \"Himes is essential to the Lew Griffin books as well; he's mentioned in them all, the second is dedicated to his memory, in the third he actually does a walk-on.\" </p> <p>A white writer dissembling, a black writer dissembling, white writers on black writers, black writers on white - it shouldn't matter, should it? So why is it that in over a decade of reviewing scores of books I have only once been asked or allowed to appraise a work by a white writer, and that dealing with black subject matter? In the final words of Himes's Blind Man With a Gun: \"That don't make any sense.\" \"Sure don't.\"</p>",

The depths of the ex-Smiths singer's mailbag would be a thing of wonder if they were half as hilarious or harrowing as Russell's belated debut as a novelist. Educating Rita was the play that explained how Russell, himself a ladies' hairdresser, came to redirect his destiny in order to write; The Wrong Boy is essentially a novel about writing itself. </p> <p>Raymond, like Russell, is a boy who needs to write: not through any high-minded idea of authorship, but as a means of clinging on to his precarious sanity. The dispatches to Morrissey remain unsent, interspersed with poems and songs in the journal he has compiled since the unfortunate fallout from the fly-trapping incident at the canal. </p> <p>It was the fly you had to feel sorry for. There it was, buzzing along the Rochdale canal, before coming to rest on the exposed glans of some smutty teenage truant; and without any time to assess the situation - whap! - the poor thing gets asphyxiated by foreskin. It's the end of that particular fly's problems, but only the beginning of Raymond's. \"We weren't wanking!\" he protests. \"None of us were. I know we had our things out, all 15 of us - but it doesn't necessarily mean we were wanking.\" </p> <p>Onanistic or not, Raymond's patented pest-control method cuts little ice with his headmaster, who has him summarily expelled on a charge of group masturbation, bestiality and being out of bounds during the lunch hour. The scandal transforms an ordinary boy into a pariah. Shunned by friends, politely requested to leave the Scouts, Raymond retreats to his bedroom, where he is perfectly happy being miserable until Uncle Bastard Jason fixes him up with a job on a Grimsby building site and issues stern instructions to sort himself out. </p> <p>The novel is principally a cod-picaresque odyssey to the cod basket of the north, with Raymond's hapless hitchhiking bringing him into contact with all manner of short-tempered transport officials, psychopathic truck drivers and a vanful of Dewsbury desperadoes en route to a country-music convention. The dialogue - as you might expect from a dramatist - is cracking stuff: a colloquial poetry reminiscent of Roddy Doyle. </p> <p>Like Doyle, Russell is capable of pushing light fiction into some disturbingly dark corners. Though the laughs never flag for long, Ray's case history has him dredge up incidents from the deepest recesses of real misery: a litany of adult miscomprehension leading to special schools, suspected sexual abuse, suicide attempts and wasted swathes of time spent as a drug zombie on day wards. Throughout, the inarticulate adolescent lacks the resources to fend for himself, but maintains the miraculous ability to express himself privately though the written word. </p> <p>Ray, in other words, is a misunderstood talent waiting to be discovered: and while the ending may seem too sentimental for some, Russell's novel remains an alarmingly personal tract expressed in unpretentious language, which heavyweight critics, in the words of his own educated Rita, \"probably won't like, because you can understand it\".</p>"
