  "<p>The shambolic, ignominious fall of Slobodan Milosevic, for 13 years the most powerful figure in Yugoslavia, proves again that student power - the irreverence of youth - is the one enduring factor no leader should ever take for granted. </p> <p>Milosevic appeared immovable until Generation X, Serbs as young as 16 who had only ever known war, decided to dislodge him, according to Balkan specialists. </p> <p>The rottenness of the regime may have enabled it to collapse bloodlessly and in record time (three hours, witnesses say). But it was the birth and dedication of the student movement known as Otpor (\"Resistance\") which ultimately brought much-needed momentum to a process that Serbia's disillusioned democrats had otherwise given up on. </p> <p>Amidst all the mirth and mystery still shrouding the precise chain of events that lead to Milosevic's calamitous defeat, there is one thing of which historians are in no doubt: the tyrant's ouster owes as much to the irrepressible optimism of Otpor as it does to the millions of dollars invested in the opposition by the west. Eventually, Serbia's youth - wide-eyed teenagers, university attendees and graduates - did what 10 years of economic sanctions, isolation and Nato bombs failed to do. </p> <p>\"In Serbia we have seen students yet again replace the workers,\" says Robert Rotberg, director of the Kennedy School's programme on intra-state conflict at Harvard University. \"It happened in Hungary in 56, Iran in 79, China in 1989 and then Prague. Workers have more at stake. Students don't have jobs, families, children, and at the barricades they're not so easily coerced. They're fed on the rhetoric of change and they can galvanise people around them.\" </p> <p>From the start Otpor was a non-violent movement. But it had an ingenuous, grassroots strategy that it followed from the outset; one that allowed the group to build the biggest possible anti-Milosevic coalition. Its ranks ultimately included members of Serbia's Orthodox church and other once-prominent nationalists. </p> <p>By artfully blending street protests with plain silly happenings, the movement managed to channel anger into the countryside, where ordinary Serbs, manipulated by Milosevic's propaganda machine, had no idea how to vent their frustration. </p> <p>\"We made a few very simple calculations,\" explains Vuk Jeremic, Otpor's international representative who \"spread the message\" from his Tower Hill home in London. </p> <p>\"Our polls showed that 40% of the population was so disillusioned, after 13 years of war, poverty and the Nato bombing, it did not even want to vote. When we found out that at least 65% of that number was between 18 and 25 we realised we had found our target audience.\" </p> <p>The hope, he said, was to get at least 70% of the population to vote \"because you can steal 150,000 votes, but it's practically impossible to steal a million\". </p> <p>With the clenched-fist as their symbol, the activists had two slogans - Vremeje (\"It's Time\") and Gotov Je (\"He's Finished\"); three weapons - badges, stickers and posters; and one mission - to give people the courage to believe that every ballot would count in the battle to remove a regime that relied on fear. But campaigning was far from easy. \"After the Nato bombing, telling Serbs to emulate western democracies was like putting a red rag to a bull,\" says Jeremic. </p> <p>Recognising Otpor's burgeoning popularity, however, western organisations began injecting much-needed cash into the movement. </p> <p>Last April, Harvard's Kokkalis program on south-eastern Europe at the Kennedy school invited Jeremic and other Serb opposition leaders to flesh out their policies at a now historic conference. \"There was a lot of arguing, but there were US state department officals there who said, 'If you want to campaign, this is what you should do'.\" The advice was to prove invaluable. </p> <p>Otpor was originally conceived to resist the draconian 1997 university law purging higher education establishments of opposition voices. From its birth, it operated as an amorphous group that eschewed leadership as much as it avoided politics (other than the cause of democracy) in a deliberate bid to both elude detection and keep squeaky clean. </p> <p>More than anything, historians say, it was the movement's incorruptible, innocent image that helped transform it into a truly national force. By election day, Otpor had opened 140 branches across the pariah state, its clenched fist and optimistic tone infiltrating every village and hamlet. </p> <p>\"Otpor was much less institutionalised than any of the opposition parties,\" says Slobodan Homen, one of the movement's original founders. \"But it was very organised and disciplined and could adapt much more easily to any situation. Being flexible enabled us to mobilise a huge number of people who were disappointed in the opposition and saw through the lies of the regime.\" </p> <p>A lot of that initial support came from the families of Otpor members, now believed to exceed some 50,000. The sight of youngsters being beaten, or arbitrarily arrested, was more than many Serbs could take. As the repression grew so too did the resistance of exiled Serb students, who also joined the movement. </p> <p>\"We had some 2,500 arrests on record and whenever members were hauled into the police station it was mothers who went and begged for their release,\" says Jeremic. \"Entire families soon joined the cause, often under the influence of their children.\" </p> <p>Do Homen or Jeremic, whose parents fled to England with the rise of Milosevic in 1990, envisage becoming involved in the new Serbia's political scene? There are not a few who believe that Otpor activists could soon be forming the country's new political elite. </p> <p>\"I'm sure a lot of us will want to go into politics once we have finished studies that have been disrupted for so long,\" says Homen, 28. For the moment, however, Otpor is keen to just act as a watchdog \"to see that reform is done\". \"We're not going to go away,\" says Jeremic. \"We're going to watch from below.\" </p> <p>As true revolutionaries who work from the bottom, Serbia's militant youth are clearly going to be the new conscience of their new country. </p> <p> <strong>Can you help?</strong><br></p> <p> Precisely because Serbian students were the target of so much of the ancien regime's venom, Yugoslavia's new politicians are now prioritising educational reform. In deference to Otpor's revolutionary role, the Democrats have moved fast to purge the country's five state-run universities - institutions that often suffered at the behest of Slobodan Milosevic's powerful, pseudo-academic sociologist wife Mira Markovic. Tenured professors, deans and departmental heads, ousted by government-approved replacements when the regime passed laws stripping universities of their autonomy in 1998, are being reinstated. </p> <p>Professor Maria Bogdanovic, the eminent philosopher, is back as chancellor of Belgrade University. Other faculty members who had joined her in setting up an alternative university - run for two years as an underground establishment - are returning. In several departments classes have begun. \"One of our main aims is to get exiled students to return,\" says Harvard-based Ana Trbovic, who heads the organisation of Serbian students abroad. </p> <p>Academic erosion began in 1992, when the international community slapped economic sanctions on Serbia. Most of the institutions, including Belgrade University, once seen as the best in Eastern Europe after Moscow, now lack basic equipment. </p> <p>Otpor hopes that the new government will make up for the losses by re-channelling Milosevic's ludicrous expenditure on the police and military into education. \"We're in this strange wait-and-see time with a lot of reforms being put on hold until [parliamentary] elections this December,\" says Jeremic. \"We are appealing to academics everywhere to come and help.\" </p> <p> If you want to help, contact Otpor founder Slobodan Homen at slobodanhomen@hotmail.com or call the human rights group Civic Alliance of Serbia: 003811 3341696 </p> <p> \u0095 Helena Smith is currently a Nieman fellow at Harvard University</p>",
  "<p>Angie Gaunt is one that nearly got away. In the 70s in Leeds she wasn't considered A-level material and found herself doing a secretarial course. Course lecturers soon realised that she wasn't destined for the typing pool. \"My college lecturer got me a place at teacher training college.\"</p> <p> Gaunt's first job was in London, under ILEA control, where she taught business studies. Gaunt was first promoted to head of department and then to advisory teacher at the London computer centre. On the authority's demise, Angie moved north. She found herself at William Beaumont Community School in Warrington, as business studies teacher, ICT coordinator and head of year. Facilities were poor when she arrived - some teachers were still using BBC micros - but her results were soon among the best in Cheshire. In 1997 a new headteacher, John O'Callaghan, arrived from a City Technology College. </p> <p> Determined to invest in ICT he asked Gaunt for her vision for the school and its pupils. \"She convinced me that we should create a facility for the next century that would not only serve the needs of the school, but also the local primary schools and the community,\" he recalled. Three years later the school has five purpose-built ICT rooms with over 150 machines, networked with internet access. Eight feeder primary schools obtain free internet access through the school's broadband connection to the local FE college; and local community groups use the school's facilities.</p> <p>\"The investment in kit isn't an issue for me at all,\" says Gaunt. \"You're investing in the quality of children's education. We live in the computer age; schools should be the same as any other workplace. Why should we have second-class technology?\"</p> <p>But the kit alone is not enough. Teachers need the confidence to use it, so she runs support sessions for William Beaumont staff and teachers from local primary schools. She uses her non-contact time to teach year 5 and 6 children. \"Her enthusiasm and knowledge of ICT is tremendous,\" says Paul Fleming, headteacher of St Anne's Primary school. \"She has the ability to get the best out of children and to put nervous colleagues at ease.\"</p> <p>Her dedication has given her students confidence in ICT. Her year 11 group of 15-year-old students were working with Power Point, using sound, music and video to build a presentation on a local leisure centre. \"If you don't understand something she'll sit down with you until you are 100% sure,\" says student Matthew Wilson. Sarah Clarke argues that Gaunt's success in her lessons comes from creating the right atmosphere. \"In our lessons she's very relaxed,\" she said. \"If she wants you to do something you'll do it because you respect her so much.\" With the award money the school will be buying an interactive whiteboard, but \"I'd like to be able to allow parents and children to dial in to the system from home,\" Gaunt says.</p> <p> In her spare time Gaunt works out at the local fitness centre: \"The gym provides me with time and energy,\" she says. She's married and evenings are reserved for her nine-year-old daughter. \"At least until she goes to bed, then it's back onto the internet.\" She's aware that winning the national award will open up opportunities, but she's not sure where her future lies. \"There are still things I want to do here,\" she says. Whatever turns up she will resist pressures to leave the classroom. \"I'm very much a teacher and I want to continue doing that.\"</p> <p><strong>The judge says:</strong><br></p> <p>It's crucial to our children that we develop their capacity to use ICT for work as well as for leisure. We must transform our schools and do it fast. We need teachers who will not just move themselves, but who will move the system. That's what we looked for in our ICT Teachers of the Year. They had to have gained enormous knowledge about the technology, and expertise in using it.</p> <p> They had to recognise its potential throughout the school and have the character to fire up colleagues to want to have a piece of the action. They needed the obsessiveness of the visionary, but the patience that allows nervous colleagues to gain confidence exploring new territory. But, most of all, to win the award they had to excite children, motivate them, stretch them, give them the confidence to be bold and push themselves. They needed to have that wonderful control of a class where pupils fly rather than fear moving. </p> <p><strong>David Mallen</strong><br></p> <p> <strong>Regional winners: </strong><br></p> <p> <strong>Martin Ashburn </strong>North East, and Cumbria Seaton Hirst Middle School, Northumberland<br></p> <p><strong>David Blow </strong>South East, The Ashcombe School, Dorking<br></p> <p><strong>Adeline Dinsmore</strong> Northern Ireland, Belfast Model School For Girls<br></p> <p><strong>James Fanning </strong>South, Tideway School &amp; Sixth Form Centre, Newhaven<br></p> <p><strong>Angela Gaunt </strong>North West, William Beamont High School, Warrington<br></p> <p><strong>Richard Heppell</strong> East Mids, The Beauchamp College, Oadby<br></p> <p><strong>James Martland</strong> S West, Jersey College For Girls, Jersey<br></p> <p><strong>Gary Morgan</strong> Wales, Whitchurch High, Cardiff<br></p> <p><strong>Paul Noble</strong> East, The Bishop's Stortford High School, Bishop's Stortford</p>",
  "<p>After only two years in the classroom, Trenica King has inspired and influenced not only her pupils and fellow teachers, but also non-teaching staff and parents. </p> <p>King is in her first job as a health and social care teacher at a sprawling secondary in an Essex \"new town\". The winner of the award for the most outstanding new teacher of the year in a secondary school has succeeded against the odds in winning the trust of teenagers living in a socially deprived area which has the highest crime rate and the highest proportion of single parents in the county. </p> <p> At Chalvedon school in Pitsea near Basildon, her head teacher Alan Roach explains that King has faced tougher challenges than many young teachers at the start of their careers by deliberately choosing a school in an Education Action Zone. </p> <p> The school has seen the proportion of youngsters gaining A-C grades at GCSE increase from just 4% 12 years ago to 34% now. </p> <p> \"She has won over difficult pupils and made them recognise the importance of education,\" he says. \"She always goes that extra mile by going beyond the call of duty to support students whenever they are taking part in something\". In return, the pupils who accompanied her to the regional awards ceremony in Norwich rewarded her with a deafening roar of approval as she went onto the stage. </p> <p> Roach claims King's vision of what could be achieved by children regardless of their social background was clear even when she came for interview. \"It was evident even from her school record of achievement that she had something very special to offer. We consider ourselves very lucky to have her\".</p> <p> Lynn Pounder, the school's chair of governors, adds: \"From the very start Trenica impressed her mentors and senior staff, gaining the respect of all her colleagues and winning the trust and admiration of her pupils. She uses her talents to support and develop the whole team\". </p> <p> While still in her first year as a health and social care teacher King was given extra responsbilities and was later promoted to head of department. She has made the GNVQ course highly popular. Some of the sixth formers who praised her teaching abilities said it was \"amazing that she is able to make units like 'the structure of the NHS' interesting\", describing her as \"a combination of brilliant teacher and friend\". </p> <p> King is form tutor for 30 15-year-olds. Her charges confide in her, and parents report that they find her a rare and special teacher, who communicates with all age groups. </p> <p> Every single member of her form, 9P, provided a letter of support for her nomination. \"I think Miss King is the best form tutor because she is caring, helpful, honest and most of all exciting,\" said Chloe Emmons. Ross Whittaker added: \" She praises you when you need praising and helps you when you need helping\". As an extra bonus, King takes her tutor group out on weekend outdoor activities, where they benefit from her sporting and sailing prowess. </p> <p> King does not believe that winning the national award will make a difference to her personally, but it will help to put the school on the map. The school intends to use the \u00a320,000 prize money to create the first hi-tech \"staffroom of the future\" in the country. \"The award won't change me, but it's absolutely fantastic for the school,\" she concluded.</p> <p>\u0095 The judge says:</p> <p>Being inside a classroom observing these gifted new teachers was a privilege. We were recording and celebrating qualities which had already been recognised by the governors, headteachers and colleagues who had nominated them. Their good teaching practice arose from personality, education and training - and their school. They were special people who all worked in challenging but supportive schools which allowed their potential to be released. </p> <p> They were all extraordinarily mature, confident and highly organised individuals who obviously enjoyed their jobs and liked their pupils. We found absolutely no resentment from colleagues, quite the opposite. We came away from each visit full of optimism about these new entrants to the profession. <strong>Bob Finch</strong></p> <p><strong>Regional winners:</strong></p> <p> <strong>Shirley Dunn</strong> N Ireland, Belfast Model School For Girls<br> <strong>Michelle Jones</strong> E Mids, Vale of Catmose College, Oakham<br> <strong>James Kelly</strong> North, Ripon College, Ripon<br> <strong>Raza Khan</strong> N West, Elms Bank Comm.

  "<p>Cathy Roberts has been head of music at St Aidan's Church of England Secondary school in Harrogate for six years. \"My philosophy is equal opportunities in music for every child,\" says Roberts. \"They each have a creative streak, whatever their coordination and whatever their physical ability. My job is to make them believe in themselves.\" Her enthusiasm for her work has not gone unrecognised - her nomination for the Guardian Award for Teacher of the Year was proposed by the parents.</p> <p>\"We have a Down's Syndrome pupil who is learning flute and piano because she loves music,\" says Roberts. \"I believe music is a marvellous leveller, which develops so many skills - coordination, performance, discipline and listening - which can be brought to other subjects.\" Roberts, 34, has a background in both primary and secondary schools, and taught primary teachers how to teach music. At St Aidans, she heads a team of three full-time music staff, one part-time teacher and 17 instrumental teachers. Headteacher Dennis Richards said: \"In this age of focus on numeracy, literacy and science, it is so refreshing and invigorating to have a musician like Cathy involving each pupil in a subject which might have been sidelined, or deemed less important.\"</p> <p>Around 400 pupils take instrumental lessons, and Roberts directs three ensembles, including the school concert band of 120 which has played in Canada, the US and Sweden. She also heads the Chamber Choir of 52 which has toured Holland, Belgium and Germany, and reached the semi-finals of Sainsbury's Choir of the Year.\"She has a superhuman commitment,\" says Richards. \"In 30 years, I have never met a teacher who comes anywhere remotely near her in terms of devoting their own time to students.\"</p> <p> Her dedication is particularly evident when one learns that once a term the chamber choir sings live for Radio Four's daily service. This requires them to leave school at 5:30am, rehearse from 8am, go live at 9:45 and get back on the bus for school at 10am. \"Cathy works brilliantly under pressure and has enabled a bunch of not naturally outstanding youngsters to sing to a very high standard indeed,\"says Philip Billson, the producer for BBC Religion. \"She achieves this both through her own excellent musicianship, but also her inspiring leadership.\"</p> <p> Roberts' passion for her job means she is at school most nights until 8pm. \"If I've gone the extra mile for music it's in the hours,\" she admits. \"But I don't often think about it, because as soon as I arrive at a cathedral on a Sunday morning and see how excited the children are to perform, it's all worth it.\"</p> <p> Roberts's teaching methods are inclusive, and every pupil at the school will take part in a concert performance. This term, Roberts is teaching year 7 rhythm and singing through the cantata - 230 pupils will then sing at the Royal Hall in Harrogate. \"It is really important that each child experiences a live performance,\" she says. \"Every pupil must know what it is like to be on stage and see the audience clapping them. Every child should be given a voice.\" She is currently teaching rap to year 9, culminating in a performance by 13 and 14 year olds using only their voices and classroom props.</p> <p> When asked about her award, Roberts says: \"I am here to represent the school, so I have won for them. Without the support of other staff, I wouldn't be here.\" The prize money will go towards music technology teaching at the school, which has just started an A-level in the subject. \"Recording and mixing equipment and microphones are important not only for our pupils, but for the local special school and blind students.\"</p> <p> The last word should go to a parent. Pauline Hanover, whose 13-year-old son attends St Aidan's, feels she owes a debt of gratitude to Roberts: \"The musical soul of our son has been encouraged, nurtured and strengthened by Mrs Roberts. Music is undoubtedly her life, and now, through her inspiration, it is our son's.\" </p> <p> Surely that is what every teacher strives to achieve.</p> <p> <strong>The judge says:</strong><br></p> <p> Judging the secondary teacher of the year national award this year, I was very conscious of how proud each school was of their finalist. They saw the award as recognition of both their excellent teacher and their school. We spoke to ex-pupils, present pupils, other staff, parents and the community. We were continually impressed, both by the outstanding teaching and by the ex pupils, parents and others who took time to tell us about the impact of a particular teacher on their lives. </p> <p> Each visit was a school's celebration of the best there is in teaching. If only we could bottle this pride and enthusiasm and give it to those who decry our teachers. While we have teachers like these, the future is bright.</p> <p><strong>Frances Raval</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Regional winners: </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Susan Ball</strong> E Mids, Uppingham Comm.

  "<p>Alison Hatch is a great fan of chicken wire and Modroc, the stuff used to make plaster casts. They have played a part in her winning this year's Guardian Award for Primary Teacher of the Year. With them Hatch performs the feats of after-school artistry that transform her 4th Year classroom at Northdown School, Margate from a dragon's lair to an Egyptian pyramid by way of a WWII air raid shelter. One of her colleagues has described visiting her as being akin to \"walking into a storybook\". </p> <p> \"This term we are studying the Romans - hence the columns,\" she explains. On another wall is a gigantic pair of 3D lips. \"That's made from corrugated card and it's linked to a unit we're studying about language. I'm also linking it to some work on a healthy diet and fillings.\" This capacity to squeeze the maximum from every resource seems to be Alison's style. She admits to sleeping with a paper and pen at her bedside - \"in case I get a good idea in the night.\" </p> <p>It seems remarkable that Alison Hatch has any time for sleep. She is the team leader for Years 3 and 4, she is the PE coordinator, in charge of ICT, she runs dance and gymnastic clubs after school, and has recently taken on the role of teacher governor. </p> <p> Hatch has been a teacher for 11 years; this is her third school. Northdown serves what has been described as one of the most socially disadvantaged communities in Kent. Many of the parents are living in B&amp;B and refuge accommodation. \"Just when you have got the class settled, there are newcomers. And as many of them come as refugees, their English is often non-existent. Hence, the interest in language and lips!\"</p> <p> Hatch aims to create a place of order and calm in the children's lives. Her headteacher, Jacqueline Cox, who nominated her, said: \"Through her high expectations and warm personality she instils a sense of pride and delight.\"</p> <p> Hatch's enthusiasm rubs off on the parents too. One parent who supported her nomination for the Guardian Award said: \"Miss Hatch was the only teacher who actually got on the bouncy castle with her class at a fund-raising event last year. There was much laughter all round. Her fondness for the children was so apparent.\"</p> <p> Hatch is overjoyed at the attention the school is receiving as a result of her success. But this is not the first time she has put Northdown on the map. Her efforts have been central to the success of the school's football, rounders and netball teams. \"I heard that we had won the Thanet five-a-side football trophy the first time when I was in hospital and my scream of joy scared everyone on the ward.\"</p> <p> Hatch has a severe form of Lupus - which causes her immune system to turn on her own organs and joints. All the more remarkable then, that the children praise her for her consistent good humour.</p> <p> Alison sees her award as a vote of confidence for the whole school and pays tribute to the teamwork that makes Northdown such a happy place. The \u00a320,000 prize will be spent on networking. \"We hope to set up a web link to cameras in the pond and some nesting boxes in our environment garden,\" she explains. \"The children will be able to keep an eye on the caddis fly and check out what the snails are doing.\"</p> <p> <strong>Regional winners: </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Angela Bonser</strong> West Mids, Bentley West JMI Hearing Impaired Resource, Walsall<br></p> <p><strong>Pam Browne </strong>S West, Starcross Primary School, Exeter<br></p> <p><strong>Lisa Byrom </strong>N East, Bransty Primary School, Whitehaven<br></p> <p><strong>Sue Dodd</strong> East, Woodham Walter CE Primary, Maldon<br></p> <p><strong>Judith Finney</strong> West Dilton, Marsh Primary, Westbury<br></p> <p><strong>Geraldine Fitzpatrick</strong> Northern Ireland, St Malachys Primary School, Newry<br></p> <p><strong>Sarah Groves-Allen</strong> North, Belton CE Primary, Doncaster<br></p> <p><strong>Alison Hatch</strong> South East, Northdown Primary, Margate<br></p> <p><strong>Fiona Knight </strong>South, Charles Kingsley C of E Primary, Hants<br></p> <p><strong>Sharon Quine</strong> Wales, Rhosgoch CP School, Builth Wells<br></p> <p><strong>Paula Roebuck</strong> East Mids, Staniland Primary, Boston<br></p> <p><strong>Claire Vanes</strong> North West, St Malachys RC Primary</p>",
  "<p><strong>SVEN THE BOAT COMES IN</strong></p> <p>Is the appointment of Sven-Goran Eriksson as England coach, and the worst weather to hit the British Isles since Mad Jock McDoom Fiver was on work experience at the Met Office, by any chance related? Probably not, seeing as Lazio's Swedish coach is not renowned for his meteorological powers. But with the apocalyptic warnings that filled today's back pages - the Sun's John Sadler practically had a stroke - you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.</p> <p>The FA (CEO: Adam \"Del Boy\" Crozier) this afternoon confirmed that Eriksson will be the new Kelvin Koogan, signing a five-year contract to take full-time responsibility of the side from July 1 2001, with the potential before this date to coach part-time. Crozier, facing a barrage of \"Lord Nelson would be spinning in his grave\"-style questioning, explained that Eriksson would be moving to London, is very excited about working with English players, and, aside from fellow Swede Tord Grip (who will act as his chief scout), will work with the team already in place. \"Sven-Goran Eriksson was the unanimous choice of our selection team\", Crozier said. \"He is one of the best coaches in the world. We're very certain we've made the right choice.\"</p> <p>It's good that the FA are getting their retaliation in first, as Sven is unlikely to have an easy time of it. The players are reported to have preferred an English coach, the fans certainly did, and some pundits would rather see a foreigner take charge of Britain's media outlets (hang on) than England's football team. This fact was not lost on the Swedish press this morning, who observed: \"Welcome to the world's toughest job, Svennis,\" using their pet name for the former Gothenburg boss. \"Even if there are bigger tasks in the world of football,\" wrote columnist Mats Olsson in the daily Expressen, \"there's nothing that's so prestigious, charged, important and probably so wonderful as being in charge of England.\" Which is probably the best use of \"probably\" for some time.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>DANE DEAL DONE</strong></p> <p>Danish international winger Jesper Gronkjaer was born in Greenland at the height of the summer dog-sled season. So he's a quick lad. But not even he could escape the clutches of Colin Hutchinson, managing director of swanky London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea. Because today - after a 12-month chase - Hutch finally got his man, signing Gronkjaer from Ajax for an ice-cool \u00a37.8m. Unfortunately for Chelsea fans, the Dane has a slight thigh strain and so won't be arriving until January 1. But despite this problem (Greg Van Rusedski anyone?) there were smiles all round south-west London this morning. </p> <p>\"This is a great move for me,\" a delighted Gronkjaer admitted. \"I was very impressed when I visited Chelsea. I spoke with Claudio Ranieri for two hours and liked what he had told me. I am looking forward to working with him and playing with some of Europe's top players.\" And Dennis Wise too, we wager. Meanwhile, Hutch was also in a happy mood, and quickly allayed fears that Gronkjaer's injury was serious. \"Because of Euro 2000, Jesper only had one week of holiday this summer,\" he claimed. \"The present minor injury needs rest.\"</p> <p>So come January, what type of player will Chelsea be getting for their money? Well, Barcelona wanted him, as did the big clubs in Italy, especially after his performances in Euro 2000, where he averaged 12 dribbles per game - more than any other player. And if that isn't impressive enough, Gronkjaer's favourite film is The Fugitive, and his plans for life outside football include working in a bank. In fact, there's only one potential problem with Chelsea's new golden boy: Gronkjaer is often compared with the Laudrup brothers - and we all know what brother Brian did after just a few weeks at the Bridge.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We have to make the game more of a show. An idea would be to have a longer half-time and put on a show. It does not have to be music, but it is important that there is something else for the fans\" - Graham Taylor finally acknowledges what Watford supporters have known for years.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE WHIRLPOOL FROM LIVERPOOL</strong></p> <p>You can always gauge Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier's mood by looking into his eyes. For example, after a comfortable away win, his glassy orbs turn gently. But if Liverpool have been beaten at home, they begin to pick up speed alarmingly. So when they set off on a variable spin speed cycle with rinse hold and reverse tumble for an unbeatable wash performance - like they did this morning - you know something's seriously wrong.</p> <p>The out-of-control optical oscillations began when Titi Camara, upset at being left out of the first team all season, handed in a transfer request last weekend. Since Camara had been unavailable for selection until the middle of October due to injury and international duty, Houllier thought this strange. \"I can't accept that someone who has been available to this club for only ten days, during which time we played three games and won all three, wants to leave because he is not in the team,\" he reasoned pro-logically. \"It disappoints me for the fans and I don't think its being fair on the club.\"</p> <p>It soon became clear that Houllier had embarked not on an economy programme but an intensive one (with pre-iron settings). Questioning the commitment of Camara - who scored for Liverpool on the day his father died - he continued: \"He is the only player I know who has got injured without playing. The injury was so bad that he could only come back seven weeks later. I don't know what kind of injury he had.\" All this suggests Titi's time at Anfield is at an end, but as previous suitors Manchester City, Bradford and Celtic are no longer interested, he could soon be off back to France. Whatever happens, though, the Fiver hopes this will be the last time either Gerard or Titi airs their dirty laundry in public.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Leeds have again been linked with a move for Croatia Zagreb midfielder Zoran Pavlovic.

  "<p>A year ago, Teresa Kay, now 26, refused further chemotherapy or orthodox treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph glands. Doctors calculate that in her age group there is a 50% chance of cure if treated conventionally. Teresa, instead, opted to follow the Gerson therapy, a gruelling regime which consists of hourly freshly made organic juices, a strict diet, injections and five coffee enemas a day. It demands a monastic life, tough on participants, friends and relatives. It is costly and requires an iron commitment. So, in the 12 months since Teresa began the treatment, when her story first appeared in the Guardian, how has she fared? </p> <p>Before cancer was diagnosed, Teresa, who is single, worked as an art director in television and lived in Bristol. Her widowed mother, Venetia, has a cottage in Oxford where she teaches cello. After her diagnosis, Teresa moved in with Venetia (she now splits her time between the cottage and a nearby bedsit). The two say they had a good relationship before but have now become \"a team\". </p> <p>\"If you don't get on,\" says Venetia, \"it must be a living nightmare, not least because there's just so much work involved each day, every day.\" </p> <p>Wednesday, when I visit, is organic vegetable delivery day - \u00a3150 worth a week. In the overflowing kitchen, Miche, one of the helpers paid to juice and cook five mornings a week, is preparing Hippocrates soup (tomatoes, celeriac, onions and distilled water), to be eaten twice a day. On the table is a wonderful feast - unless, of course, you are irredeemably wedded to steak, chips, brown sauce and bitter, in which case it is then menu from hell. </p> <p>Gerson does not permit salt, pepper, coffee, tea, wine, processed foods, fats, butter, carbohydrate or protein. Its aim is to detoxify and boost the body nutritionally by introducing large amounts of potassium and removing excess sodium, enabling the immune system to fight off malignancies. Max Gerson, a German army doctor who refined the regime in the 30s, believed that surgery, radiation and chemotherapy hinders rather than helps by damaging the liver and other organs. Scientific proof for his theory is nonexistent. Its popularity rests solely on individual histories. </p> <p>On the table are several dishes, including baked potatoes; red cabbage and chard stalks cooked in orange juice and cider vinegar; aubergines and yellow pepper baked in maple syrup; and hokkaido squash roasted with tarragon, plus a pile of garlic cloves, which Teresa squashes over her food along with linseed oil and low-fat yoghurt. Fast food this isn't. \"We genuinely love the diet,\" says Venetia, a former carnivore. \"Eating is the pleasurable part.\" </p> <p>Teresa is a picture of health; clear eyes, beautiful skin, lots of smiles, a strong sense of humour. She radiates attitude of the most positive kind. \"I see the cancer not as a negative experience but an unexpected turning in my life,\" she says. \"When I'm well, I want to work in this field. It's given me a new beginning.\" </p> <p>Tim Littlewood, Teresa's doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, specialises in haematological cancers. \"It's rare to meet a person as serene and confident as Teresa - with or without lymphoma,\" he says. On her last visit, he adds, her blood tests were normal, she had no lumps and there was no evidence that the lymphoma had returned. </p> <p>A scan would reveal the precise state of Teresa's health but she refuses to have one. \"No matter what it revealed, it wouldn't alter how I'm choosing to treat the cancer,\" she says. \"Even after the two years are up, I'll continue with a modified diet because I just feel weller and weller.\" </p> <p>In her early 20s, Teresa developed dermatomyasitis, a muscle-wasting disease. Steroids were prescribed. Teresa refused and opted for exercise and acupuncture instead. It was a fortunate decision, since steroids might have masked the cancer. Eighteen months ago, Teresa developed a lump under her arm. It was diagnosed as benign, so she refused to have it removed. </p> <p>Three months of intense pain followed, and one lump developed into three. Twice she asked for the lumps to be looked at again; both times she was given painkillers. Finally, the specialist treating her dermatomyasitis saw the lumps and ordered tests. Teresa embarked on the first course of chemotherapy. </p> <p>It hospitalised her for three days. \"I was convinced that because my body was already so weak from the dermatomyasitis, the chemo would kill me, even if the cancer didn't,\" she explains. \"I decided on Gerson. People around me were horrified. My oncologist at the time told me that I would die and I was really scared. Since taking the decision though, I've never lost faith - not once. I'm not seeking another five years of life. My aim is to become completely well.\" </p> <p>She knows that for others, Gerson has been tougher. One friend with three small children has died. Others have minimal help; they struggle with the diet and find the experience much more of an emotional roller-coaster. Teresa says that recently, boredom has begun to bite. She finds herself skipping enemas then worrying about the effect on her recovery; she now loathes the weekly injection of vitamin B12 and liver extract and is aware that she doesn't rest enough. She has taken up yoga and begun an Open University degree in health and disease but the strictures of Gerson preclude a normal social life. \"It can be very isolating,\" she says, more as a statement of fact than in search of pity. \"But I don't have a single regret.\" </p> <p>\"A year on, it's like being in the trenches,\" her mother says. \"It's no longer a novelty, you don't have the same adrenalin rush; others naturally don't have the same degree of interest. All we can do is roll up our sleeves and just get on with it.\" </p> <p>Money is also a problem. A two-year regime costs \u00a340,000. Friends, family and strangers initially donated half that sum but now there is only enough to last five months. </p> <p>One of the positive offshoots of the Gerson regime, Venetia says with pride, is that Teresa has \"brilliant ideas\". One is for a dot.com concept which seems workable. The other is to produce her version of a Gerson cookbook. Teresa chuckles at the idea of becoming the laid-back Jamie Oliver of the alternative circuit. She is a natural star. </p> <p>\"Whether Teresa's present heath is due to the initial dose of chemotherapy or the Gerson therapy or a combination of both, it's impossible to tell, but who cares?\" says Littlewood. \"What Teresa has done is take control of her own future, and put heart and soul into the effort. That's what matters. That and the fact that she's in good health.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Gerson Support Group, PO Box 74, Leatherhead, Surrey KT22 7YD.</p>",
  "Texas is the second most populous state of the Union. It accounts for 32 votes in the presidential electoral college, more than any other state except California (54) and New York (33). It should therefore be the arena for fierce campaigning - were it not for the unassailable fact that the battle is already over. It has been won by Governor George W. Bush, the state's favourite son. <p>The tone of the state press is captured in the ringing endorsement of the <a href=\"http://www.reporternews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Abilene Reporter-News</a> \"George W. Bush has a practical, principled view that the federal government's role in American life should be restrained. He wants Washington to help raise up the poorest among us and to solve such problems as guaranteeing the future of social security. But through the device of tax cuts, he also wants to further liberate the American people and to make government less like a shadow that follows everyone everywhere.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://amarillonet.com/\" target=\"_new\">Amarillo Globe-News</a> picks up the theme: \"The plan of GOP candidate George W. Bush is based on individual choice, while the plan of Democratic candidate Al Gore is based on reducing a debt assumed by the federal government and offers little in terms of true reform ... Digging deeper into the plans of each candidate, it is apparent Bush's plan of individual choice offers taxpayers more options, rather than adding to the responsibility of the federal government, which is one of the primary reasons the social security fund got in this mess in the first place.\" </p> <p>One of the few dents in this towering wall of support for Bush, appears in the <a href=\"http://austin360.com/\" target=\"_new\">Austin American-Statesman</a>, which reports an exhaustive, though not necessarily scientific, poll putting Al Gore ahead by 53% to 35%. </p> <p>Much more representative is the <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Morning News</a>, which heartily endorses Bush, and the Republican runner for the Senate. For the House of Representatives, it endorses five Republicans and three Democrats. Of Bush, the paper says: \"The moment that usually draws the greatest applause in Governor Bush's campaign speeches comes when the Republican nominee talks about bringing dignity and character back to the White House. The vigorous response reveals just how deeply some Americans thirst for a new leader. After eight years of White House investigations, fund-raising excesses and a sordid presidential sex scandal, many voters are simply worn down. Even if they enjoy this era's economic expansion, they want honor restored to the White House.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/\" target=\"_new\">San Antonio Express-News</a>features a survey suggesting that Governor Bush is backed by 55.9% of local voters, with 23.7% supporting Al Gore, and 17% still undecided.

  "<p>A small girl of my acquaintance insists on eating cornflakes without milk, flake by flake. It's a complicated thing, eating, but there are some wonderful books on the subject that might - just possibly - help. </p> <p><strong> Eat Your Peas, by Kes Gray and Nick Sharratt (Bodley Head, \u00a39.99)</strong><br> This will strike a chord in any desperate parent's heart. Daisy just won't eat her peas, even when Mum (check out Mum's necklace) offers her 92 chocolate factories, the moon, the stars, the sun - and a new fluffy pencil case. How to resolve the problem? There's a splendidly non-didactic ending and a strong bid by Daisy for a touch of common sense. It's also great fun as a counting book - double value for the money! </p> <p><strong> How to be a Practically Perfect Pig, by Nick Ward (Scholastic, \u00a34.99)</strong><br> </p> <p>This was a massive hit with every one of my testers. There's a neat touch of reverse psychology here: the two-, three- and four-year-olds suddenly turned amazingly virtuous when confronted with the anarchic goings on in the pig household, and claimed that they never gobbled down their food. (Time will tell if the effect is permanent.) The illustrations are stuffed with the tiny details that small readers love, and there's plenty to amuse adults too. </p> <p><strong> The Last Chocolate Biscuit, by Jamie Rix (Walker, \u00a34.99) </strong><br> It's rare to find a fresh new take on the vexed question of table manners, but Rix has managed it with this gloriously daft romp of a story along with an hilarious set of pictures by the irrepressible Arthur Robins. It's marvellous to read out loud, and it's also quite possible for a non-reader to study the pictures and make a pretty fair guess at everything that's going on, as Maurice does exactly as he is told and offers the last chocolate biscuit to everyone - even Maurice Monster in outer space. Fortunately space monsters have to mind their manners too, and Maurice gets home again ... to find a final twist in the tale. Hugely entertaining all round. </p> <p><strong> Wow! It's great being a duck, by Joan Rankin (Red Fox, \u00a34.99)</strong><br> This deals with the problem of being a dinner rather than eating one. Lillee is the smallest of all the ducks, and - typical of a youngest sibling - wants to be different. Off to the forest she goes, and at every excursion she is encouraged to eat a little more and grow a little fatter by Mr Furry-legs-Long-tail-Sharp-snout-Pink-tongue, until ... until what? Read it and find out. Like the illustrations, the words are both delicate and subtle ... there's a real Beatrix Potter quality to this story. \"She glared at his furry legs. She studied his LONG TAIL. She observed his sharp snout.\" It's also beautifully designed ... a lovely, lovely book. </p> <p><strong> Growing Good, by Bernard Ashley (Bloomsbury, \u00a34.99)</strong><br> If you want to know where food comes from, try this. Illustrated in luminous glowing colours by Anne Wilson, it's a real celebration of a book - a factory is knocked down, and the wasteland is taken over by the neighbours to grow all kinds of fruit and veg and flowers, despite Mr Tott's hopes for a car park. The words alone sound good enough to eat: \"Onion and okra and sorrel and spinach. Potatoes, pumpkin and poppies.\" </p> <p><strong> Goldilocks and the Three Bears, by Tony Mitton (Walker, \u00a33.99)</strong><br> The children's favourite has never looked as jolly as this. Mitton's catchy rhyming text rattles the story along, while Liz Million's bright and breezy illustrations bounce off the page. There are flip-flap pages for extra fun, and a dog and a duck to keep Goldilocks company. Even the tiniest of my testers adored every page and shouted \"Again!\" every time I finished the story ... and then ate every mouthful of her breakfast.</p>",
  "<p>\"I'll say this once,\" says a narrator purporting to be Dennis Cooper, in Cooper's novel Guide. \"I'm extremely fucked up.\" List the subject matter of Cooper's critically adored five-novel cycle, completed this week with Period, and few would disagree. In the 47-year-old Californian's two decades of fiction, you'll find the most obsessively explored sexual pathology since Sade, an uninhibited fascination with the opening of male bodies in the search for some inner perfection, whether through sex or imagined butchery. Murder, mutilation, even paedophile rape are, to the casual observer, passed over with a cool eye. </p> <p>No wonder, you think, he has received death threats (from Queer Nation). No surprise that American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis calls him, \"the last literary outlaw in mainstream American fiction\". What, though, was William Burroughs thinking when he canonised Cooper as \"a born writer\"? </p> <p>Take another look. And beneath the Californian cool and grisly physicality you may find an artist more to your taste. From the first pages of his debut novel, 1989's Closer, a desire for love infects the carnage. The humour and tenderness in 1994's Try - the cycle's structural and emotional heart, about an 18-year-old boy's search for affection amid ongoing abuse - are undeniable. Pop culture mastery and structural daring are also part of the picture; in Period, prose is pared back almost to notes, and only a lost zombie boy, George - the beloved, damaged hero of Closer - still shows emotion. </p> <p>Cooper comes as no surprise in the flesh, simply because it is useless to imagine who could write such things. Handsome, with glinting yet evasive eyes, he's tense and nervous at first, stuttering answers, but soon settles into lucid honesty. We start talking about Period, and George, the boy who has floated from one end of his fiction to the other. Any idea that the work is that of a sick sadist is quickly snuffed. George was a real boy, his deepest love from his schooldays. Just before starting Period, he discovered that George had died: a shotgun suicide. </p> <p>\"I wanted to make a book that disappeared, that committed suicide,\" Cooper says. \"I wanted it to be a grave for George. It was written out of real grief for this friend. It was about the fact that I actually wrote all these books for him, and then found out by accident he had killed himself, that he'd been dead before I started the first book. That's why Period is so full of guilt, because I'd taken this real boy, the most important person to me, and put him through the mill in my books, until he was abstract. </p> <p>\"And it's full of failure. Because the fact he had killed himself seemed to have something to do with the books. I always thought of them as being for him, but they hadn't done anything for him. I wrote the books partly to resolve my interest in sex and violence - and I did, I got rid of them, they're a joke by the end. But the stuff with George wasn't resolved at all.\" </p> <p>Even the books without George, it turns out, have the same unexpected sentiment. \"Each book has someone in it who is really close to me,\" Cooper says. \"The reason I picked George originally, and then the others, is that I know if they're the main character, I will never hurt them. No matter how bad things get, the books will always be about caring for them.\" </p> <p>Peripheral characters aren't so fortunate. From Cooper's first short stories in the early 1980s (collected in 1992's aptly titled Wrong), beautiful young boys are blankly cut up, raped and ripped, a reason for Queer Nation's ire, and others' repulsion. These are the personally gentle Cooper's own fantasies, obsessively repeated until, with Period, they seem used up. What did he learn, putting such viciousness on the page? </p> <p>\"Clarity. The books have some confused attitudes towards some really terrible things, and so did I. I'm more reasonable for writing them. I used to use a lot of drugs, I used to be crazy, and I'm not any more. I'm not as sexual. I could never just be with someone because I was so interested in the body and what was inside it. It was psychosis to write about it. But when I wrote it, I did believe it.\" </p> <p>Frisk (1991) is Cooper's definitive account of his fantasy life; it includes a long letter describing the imagined destruction of blameless boys sure to shake most readers. Written after Cooper had spent two debauched years in the novel's Amsterdam setting, and directly after an unspecified \"incident where I realised OK, this is not good\", repulsion was not the aim. </p> <p>\"No, I wanted the book to seduce you. He writes that letter wanting company, and I wrote the book to say, 'Am I the only one?' I got all kinds of responses. I got a death threat. I'm going to live down that book the rest of my life. But on the other hand, a lot of people really did understand it. It made me feel better.\" </p> <p>Were Cooper's fiction just a safety valve for his own fetishes, it would be hard to recommend. But his resolve to write out a fantasy life that began, aged 12, when he read about three boys being raped and mutilated near his home and felt a shiver of eroticised fear and fascination - to write it even though his real-life impulses are desperately protective of the young - asks deeper questions, and offers, perhaps, deeper relief. Cooper's dissection of his sexuality, and the unexpressed twists it puts in his head, will strike a chord with more people than may care to admit it. </p> <p>It all sounds \"sick\", he knows. He has a ready-made excuse if he wants it - an alcoholic mother who terrorised him as a child with repeated threats of suicide, a father who beat him. But he won't shift the blame. \"I cut my family off emotionally when I was 16, and barely stayed at home,\" he says. \"So however horrible that stuff was, I don't feel it's the answer.\" </p> <p>Cooper rejected the hippies around him as a teenager too, instead finding his ideals later, in anarchism, punk and the perfectionist writing theory of his idol, Rimbaud, the source of his structural rigour. </p> <p>\"He had absolute purity of intention,\" he declares. \"Otherwise I don't see the point. I would never be satisfied just writing a novel that sells and gets good reviews. It has to be more than that. I'm not sure my books are really good, but I think they are unique.\" </p> <p>Constant pressure to write a more conventional, \"big\" novel, to cash in his critical acclaim, as well as Period's exhaustion of himself as a fictional source, will next see him basing a book on an American high-school shooting and the teenage murderer's taped confession: \"one of the most moving things I've heard in my life. It's another way to write intensely about incommunicable emotions. I totally related to this.\" </p> <p>Cooper will no doubt face more accusations that he's bad, a nihilist. \"I never was that,\" he sighs. \"It's just because of the subject matter, and because I don't judge it. It's such lazy thinking. If anything, I err on the side of the romantic.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Period is published on Thursday by Serpent's Tail, priced \u00a317.99.</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft is in talks to buy a stake in the satellite television business to be spun out of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in a deal that could cost the software group $1bn. </p> <p>The investment in Sky Global Networks would represent the first time that Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, and Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp, have worked closely together in a business venture. </p> <p>Through its investments in cable television during the past two years, Microsoft had looked likely to compete against News Corp's satellite-based business. However, sources close to the negotiations said yesterday that Mr Gates' Seattle-based group was seriously considering a 3.5% stake in Sky Global Networks in an attempt to dominate the set-top box technology used for interactive TV. </p> <p>A News Corp spokesman in New York declined to comment on the talks yesterday, as did a Microsoft spokeswoman in Seattle. </p> <p>Analysts welcomed signs of a deal yesterday. Shares in both Microsoft and News Corp climbed after reports of the de tailed discussions first emerged. The timing of the leaked talks is particularly important for News Corp as it prepares to spin off its satellite arm. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch has indicated that he expects the business - which will consist of News Corp's stake in BSkyB, its Star TV arm in Asia and operations in Latin America and Europe - to be valued at between $38bn and $40bn. The group has been forced to delay the planned initial public offering amid the crisis in confidence for technology shares. </p> <p>Its plans were dealt a further blow earlier this month when Vivendi, the French group, announced its decision to sell its 22% stake in BSkyB in return for regulatory approval of its takeover of Seagram. </p> <p>The forced sale is likely to act as a drag on the stockmarket value of Sky Global Networks. </p> <p>One Wall Street analyst said of the Microsoft talks: \"The key thing this would do is lock in a valuation [for Sky].\" </p> <p>News Corp has held talks with several media and technology companies about a possible partnership in Sky Global Networks. Web portal Yahoo! and Nokia, the mobile phone group, have been mentioned as the most likely partners along with Microsoft. Talks with Nokia and Yahoo! appear to have cooled during the past month or so. Mr Murdoch has made it clear during this time that he would like to do a deal with either DirecTV, the satellite business owned by Hughes Electronics, or Echostar, another US satellite business. </p> <p>Microsoft already has a partnership with DirecTV, America's largest satellite broadcaster, through a new service, Ultimate TV, due to be launched later this year. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch has a deal with American cable TV tycoon John Malone for his Liberty Media Group to take a 4.76% stake in Sky Global Networks. </p> <p>Separately, Microsoft executives yesterday sought to play down the impact of the hacking episode that prompted urgent calls to the FBI last week. </p> <p>A report in the Wall Street Journal quoted one executive saying that the company had been able to monitor the trespasser soon after the \"break-in\". </p> <p>The newspaper's report raised eyebrows among security experts who doubted that such a control would have prompted the company's decision to shut down all remote access for Microsoft's employees around the world.</p>",
  "<p>Trade secretary Stephen Byers says he wants to take politics out of company mergers and takeovers. He would in future accept the findings of the office of fair trading and the competition commission and no longer intervene except in \"exceptional circumstances\". </p> <p>But suggestions that he will adopt a hands-off approach to the takeover of the Daily Express are wide of the mark. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust yesterday lodged a bid in excess of \u00a3100m for Express Newspapers. </p> <p>Decisions on the takeover of newspapers or their parent companies are subject to rules different from those found in other industries - their role in opinion forming makes them unique. The Fair Trading Act of 1973 put newspapers into a special category - the 25% threshold on market share which triggers investigations by the OFT in other industries does not apply to the press. Proposed legislation will leave the government's more interventionist role in newspapers untouched. </p> <p>Under the rules governing newspaper ownership, a referral to the competition commission is automatically made if the total circulation of the titles being acquired plus those owned by the buyer are together more than 500,000. Any acquisition of an individual newspaper with average sales of 50,000 by another media group must also be referred. </p> <p>In other words any sizeable merger or takeover will automatically come under the scrutiny of the competition commission for a \"public interest\" test before being passed to Mr Byers for a final decision. The views of anyone from rivals to advertisers will be taken into account when making a decision but issues such as pluralism of opinion are not an exact science and are open to broadly differing interpretations. Accurate presentation of news and freedom of expression are the key criteria set out by the commission. </p> <p>It has been some time since a national newspaper merger took place and it is unclear whether the fact that the Mail and Express occupy the same mid-market space would be a deal-breaking issue. The Mail group argues that it can maintain plurality of voice within a single group. It may be encouraged by the recent takeover of the Belfast Telegraph by Tony O'Reilly's Dublin-based Independent News &amp; Media. When that deal was first announced it caused uproar among the unionist community who feared the newspaper falling into the hands of a company with its headquarters in the Irish Republic. </p> <p>Mr O'Reilly, however, managed to assuage those fears by promising a separate independent board for the Belfast Telegraph and keeping the present moderate unionist editorial line. </p> <p>The Mail group is preparing a series of similar safeguards to maintain the leftwing stance of the Daily Express, at least until after the next general election. Mail insiders argue that to maintain a different editorial line makes economic sense instead of building a Daily Mail mark II. The Mail group will also hope to win favour with the promise of substantial investment in Express Newspapers. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch's acquisition of the Times and the Sunday Times in 1980 employed an \"urgency\" caveat in the rules which can allow the secretary of state to make a decision without reference to the competition commission. The rule can be invoked if the titles are \"not economic\", that is not making money. It was argued at the time that the Times and the Sunday Times were both making a loss, although diary extracts from the late Lord Wyatt of Weeford later suggested that Lady Thatcher had colluded with Mr Murdoch and that the Sunday Times was in fact in profit. Mr Murdoch made use of the rule again in 1987 when he bought Today. </p> <p>Because of the media's role in influencing the electorate, it is easy to believe that decisions taken on mergers or takeovers are rarely based on empirical evidence alone. According to the rules the financial state of the parent company does not come into play, merely the health of the newspapers. In that case, an argument could be constructed around recent figures released by City advisers to Express Newspapers' parent company United News &amp; Media which suggested they were hardly breaking even. However, United's boss, Lord Hollick, would have to threaten the titles with closure. </p> <p>News International has since managed to build a market share of more than 30%. Put together the titles owned by the Mail and Express Newspapers would account for between 25% and 30%, depending on how the total market is defined. (The chart uses a more restrictive definition based on full rate sales.) There is no set limit on how much of the national market any single newspaper baron can control. </p> <p>Even if the government's own self-interest is high on the agenda, the decision may hinge on how seriously ministers believe the reinvention of the Express should be taken. Its turn to the left has only been in effect for the past two-and-a-half years - not long in the history of Beaverbrook's creation. Although it has made much of its transformation and the attraction of a new, younger readership, a large part of its circulation is as likely to vote Tory as ever. </p> <p>If the takeover sets a precedent in the industry it is likely to be short-lived. The rules governing newspaper ownership could be turned upside down in the communications bill (due for publication later this year) which will re-examine everything from cross-media ownership to the role of BBC governors. </p> <p> David Teather is the Guardian's media business correspondent </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.teather@theguardian.com\">david.teather@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The restaurant opposite our flat, the \"Pizzeria Venezia\" down the road, the petrol station on the corner and the towing firm which dragged my illicitly-parked car away when we first moved in, all have one thing in common. They are run by Arab Americans. <p>In fact, Arab culture is so deeply embedded in Washington it is hardly noticeable any more. The lyrical sound of the language folds into the background noise of a Washington street corner. It is just part of the urban mix.</p> <p>Until now, this anonymity has suited the Arab American population well enough. It grew anxious after every skirmish with Iraq or after any terrorist bombing in the Middle East, braced for guilt by association. </p> <p>This year, however, is different. They have found a new more assertive voice, more or less by accident. It just so happens that in a few of the most keenly contested swing states in this election, Arab Americans are a sizeable minority. In Michigan, for example, which hangs delicately in the balance, Arab American voters represent 4% of the electorate, and they traditionally vote in higher numbers than their neighbours. </p> <p>It is therefore no coincidence that the community has been courted by both sides, although with much greater success by the Republican contender, George W Bush. </p> <p>In what seemed to be a mere aside in the second presidential debate, the Texas governor mentioned what he termed the \"racial profiling\" of Arab Americans by immigration officials, and the controversial use of secret evidence in the trials of suspected terrorists - who in several recent cases have been of Arabic descent.</p> <p>With those few words, Mr Bush may well have won Michigan. Democrat Al Gore is unpopular anyway among Arab Americans for his fulsome speeches in support of Israel, and, of course, by his choice of an Orthodox Jew, Joe Lieberman as his running mate. </p> <p>Arab American leaders insist that Mr Lieberman's religion is not an issue but they have accused him of divided loyalties, putting Israeli interests above strictly American ones, despite his record of sympathy for Arab American concerns. </p> <p>The Arab world viewed Mr Bush's father as one of the most sympathetic presidents in modern US history. So when Bush junior went out of his way to meet community leaders on one of his first campaign trips to Michigan, he was greeted by a receptive audience. </p> <p>Mr Gore had scheduled a similar meeting on one of his recent campaign stops but it had to be cancelled at the last minute because he had to attend an emergency White House session on escalating events in the Middle East.</p> <p>It was hardly surprising then that the Detroit chapter of the Arab American political action committee endorsed Mr Bush a few days ago. The explosion of violence on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza has only served to sharpen suspicions, and the Clinton administration is no longer seen by Arabs as an honest broker. </p> <p>Arab Americans are also an important block vote in Ohio, another traditionally swing state now leaning towards Mr Bush. But whether or not the community's influence is seen as decisive, its emergence as a coherent interest group may yet prove to be one of the more important outcomes of this election. </p> <p>It is still not nearly as well-organised as its Jewish-American rival, but it has undoubtedly appeared on the radar screen of the national campaign machines. Arab Americans have shrugged off their invisibility and are flexing their new-found political muscle. US foreign policy in the Middle East cannot remain immune to their presence.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:julian.borger@theguardian.com\">julian.borger@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/0,2759,376727,00.html\">US election race</a><br> </p> <p><b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28julian+borger%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=julian+borger&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Julian Borger</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Washington Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pentagon/\" target=\"_new\">The Pentagon</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" target=\"_new\">The White House</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://www.capsteps.com/\" target=\"_new\">Capitol Steps political satire</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://AmericanPresident.com/xword.html\" target=\"_new\">Washington crossword</a> <br><a href=\"http://dc.about.com/citiestowns/midlanticus/dc/\" target=\"_new\">Washington DC homepage</a></p>",
  "Within two weeks the question may arise: who runs Britain? The chancellor prepares his pre-budget statement against the louring threat of a national breakdown. Hauliers, with farmers at their side, presume to insist that he should grant them a large cut in fuel duty or face the consequences they imposed in September. This extraordinary state of affairs is given respectability by ceaseless repetition, especially on the BBC. November 13 has acquired awesome legitimacy. It is the expiry date of the 60-day permit the protesters graciously allotted the government to carry on running the country, prior to resuming their blockades if ministers do not submit to the hauliers' demands. <p>When the September events unfolded, the government did not know what to do. It was quite unprepared. Mr Blair was affronted and confused. Temporarily, he lost a lot of public support for the sound reason that he, as national leader, had not ensured that people could lead their normal lives. This time, if the hauliers unite to inflict another burst of direct action, the government will not be unprepared. A lot of talking has been done, with the police, the army and the oil companies, to insure against the worst consequences of haulier hubris. But the problem for ministers is worse than that. They face, in bewilderment, a modern crisis of the governing class. </p> <p>The trivial aspect of this crisis comes from technology. Mobile telephones bring disparate protesters together fast and in secret, which makes them harder to counter. There is no Arthur Scargill to demonise or treat with. Small, scattered groups which have never met are able to scheme for a common purpose, sometimes a good one. Against the subversive internet, the instruments of government lumber vainly to keep up. </p> <p>More serious for politicians is the mercurial condition of the public mind, which seems to mirror this new fluidity. What mattered in September was the willingness of the general British public to back the protest. This may have been primarily a gesture of self-interest: everybody would like lower petrol prices. And it would have begun to wither quickly once hospitals and other emergency services became terminal victims of the hauliers' callous selfishness. </p> <p>But at a deeper level, the public showed little respect for the people they pay to defend their common interest and the society in which they live. They were unimpressed by Mr Blair's appeals. They did not instinctively back him against either the blatantly illegal impositions of the hauliers or the oil companies' combination of greed and cowardice. In the showdown, the man whose party they had elected into government by a massive majority was treated with less sympathy than a bunch of sullen, bullying whingers, parked comfortably outside petrol depots watching the country grind to a halt. </p> <p>Here we see the price of the contempt into which the trade of politics has fallen. Where are these people when you need them? Mired in bogs of ridicule and mistrust, to which they have been dispatched by their own actions and by our exaggerations of their iniquity. Every time they mislead, they stack the store of disbelief. Every time they take shady political money, they seem to be on the make for their parties, not the country. Every time they shade the facts to suit themselves, they replenish scepticism. They don't always deserve this. But when a prime minister cannot secure public support for the defence of the realm against the force of a tiny group of commercially motivated men, something corrosive has happened to democracy. </p> <p>It is cynical and perverse, however, to use this evidence against Blair. To show that democratic assent is compromised is not a good reason for saying that those who compromise it are worth defending. That is what both the Conservative party and its media backers did in September. The collapse of faith in politicians is the most striking, and arguably the most disturbing, phenomenon in public life. But the coming trial of strength in Britain should be the occasion for destroying the specious arguments that support it, not sneakily reinforcing them. </p> <p>The most common, pleaded by the Daily Telegraph, is that Britain is \"no longer a properly functioning parliamentary democracy\". That is apparently enough to justify any group using direct action to secure its aims. It is poisonous nonsense. What it means is that Labour is in power with a majority that can get its way, to the displeasure of the Daily Telegraph. Mr Blair may have handled this situation with a certain insensitivity, failing to show up very often himself, and driving his legislation through as fast as the House of Lords will let him. </p> <p>But parliamentary democracy is functioning no better and no worse than when the Thatcher government drove through the poll tax. Justifying the fuel protests by reference to Labour's unshakeable majority is a singularly perverted way of defending the British system of government. </p> <p>Under that system - does one really have to say this? - the government holds the ring between competing interests, and makes a compromise between them. No one else can do this. No one else can defend weak interest groups against strong ones or the peaceful against the violent. It is sophistry to pretend that direct action by the hauliers is designed to do anything other than violence to society. Only government can defend society against its enemies, among whom the People's Fuel Lobby and Farmers for Action, with their air of creepy righteousness and triumphalist menace, should certainly be counted. If government is denied the right and duty to do that, we deliver ourselves into the hands of the biggest bully. </p> <p>Only government can determine what the level of fuel duty should be. The cost of driving lorries is higher here than in many countries, though less so if all business taxes are taken into account. Striking the balance between fiscal needs, environmental factors and political necessity is what we elect governments to do. They have to listen to every kind of request and complaint. As Jack Straw admitted yesterday, governments are giving in to pressure all the time. When Gordon Brown has finished his pre-budget calculations, it will be surprising if his intensive conversations with the road haulage industry don't yield a change in the licensing and/or tax arrangements that give it comfort. </p> <p>For some people, though, it won't be enough. They've got the bit between their voracious teeth. They evidently enjoy the power the political discourse currently assigns them. We approach a moment of truth. Either they can continue to be called fine upright citizens, for whom William Hague has nothing but respect. This will be the temptation of newspapers that have become viciously anti-Labour in the last six months. Alternatively the protest can be seen for what it is: an attempt, by ruthless little men, to exploit the vulnerability of modern societies and the weakness of their politics. It seems important that this time the public understand which side it should be on. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Cable &amp; Wireless yesterday unveiled plans to invest \u00a5150bn (\u00a31bn) over five years and create 1,000 jobs in Japan by building a state of the art fibre optic network there. </p> <p>Britain's second largest telephone company will create networks in Tokyo and Osaka offering high speed internet access to companies. It will then roll out the service to 80 other locations. </p> <p>The biggest investment by a British company in Japan's telecoms industry will be used as a platform for further expansion into Asia. Chief executive Graham Wallace hopes to increase turnover from \u00a3300m to \u00a31bn by 2005 and turn the local Cable &amp; Wireless IDC subsidiary into a fully-fledged telecoms company offering voice and data services. It has already applied for a licence to provide long-distance phone calls. </p> <p>City analysts fear it will be competing head-on with domestic heavyweights such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). In London, C&amp;W's battered share price dropped a further 16p to 964p. </p> <p>Mr Wallace said the company could secure up to 6% of the Japanese market for business telecoms. He had not given up hopes of joining up with a local partner. </p> <p>\"Today's announcement reinforces the importance of Japan as one of the three key markets for Cable &amp; Wireless' global IP (internet protocol) and data strategy, together with the US and Europe.\" </p> <p>Mr Wallace added that Japan was the second largest market in the world for telecoms services and would be a \"strategic hub\" for the rest of Asia. His group had a stronger position than AT&amp;T and British Telecom because it had majority control of its business and a healthy balance sheet. AT&amp;T and BT each own 15% stakes in Japan Telecom. </p> <p>The Japanese international market was deregulated more than a decade ago, but it was only last year that the domestic network began to open up to outside players. </p> <p>C&amp;W cemented its reputation as a resourceful foreign competitor when it beat off fierce competition from NTT to win full control of international call operator IDC. </p> <p>The C&amp;W chief executive yesterday ruled out a flotation of Cable &amp; Wireless IDC, the Japanese business where it controls 98% of the equity. </p> <p>Mr Wallace said the chaos surrounding the Italian mobile phone auction last week reinforced his belief that subsidiaries should be kept under total control. </p> <p>C&amp;W dismissed suggestions that the sale of its 54% holding in Hong Kong Telecom to Richard Li was wrongheaded given the fall in the share price of Pacific Century CyberWorks. The company said it was assured of receiving \u00a35bn in cash which would be used for expansion in Japan. It dismissed allegations that the rest of the proceeds, paid for in shares from Pacific Century, were only worth \u00a32bn compared to \u00a35bn at the time of completion in September. </p> <p>A spokesman said C&amp;W could sell some of the shares next February. By then the Pacific Century's price could be different.</p>",
  "<p>\"People want someone with warmth, someone they can relate to.\" So said the producer of a play based on selected events from the life of Victor Meldrew. They couldn't, reasoned the unimpressed impresario, relate to the grouchy protagonist of <strong> One Foot In The Grave</strong> (BBC1), never mind reconcile the absurd nature of the aforementioned events with their own lives. Events like Mrs Warboys finding a finger in her chip supper (and Victor in her bath), Victor being sent a giant plastic fly through the post and tattooists being mistaken for dentists. \"I don't believe it\", as they say. </p> <p>Of course, we do believe it, not simply because - as the producer himself would point out later - it's the writing that matters and the writing is sublime, but because the traumas, hassles and inconveniences with which Victor is afflicted are our own writ large. David Renwick's considerable achievement with this episode is that he foregrounds the process of writing, creating a classy example of meta-sitcom - Italo Calvino meets Molly Sugden - as he again conveys the weirdness of ordinary life in all its glory and how we - and I think it is a particularly British thing - react to that nonsense. It may be magnified but there is a mote of truth there nonetheless. There is a little Victor Meldrew in all of us. </p> <p> <strong> Equinox: The Science Of Stress</strong> (Channel 4) was an illuminating, scary, and resonant exploration of the subject. My Sunday night, for example, wasn't what I would call a blast. Having avoided being splattered on the runway at London City Airport, the plane I was on landed at Stansted where it sat on the runway for some 30 minutes. After another 20 minutes on a bus waiting to enter the terminal \"because there was no one to open the terminal door\", it was onto another bus to Liverpool Street. We, the paying passengers, couldn't take bags onto the bus \"because the driver didn't want us to\", and if we did, we could \"get another bus\". The lady from Stansted Airport didn't caution the driver that this was no way to speak to people and instead positively encouraged him by saying he was \"doing her a favour\" by letting us on his bus. Curious, since it looked like he was just doing his job, but there you go. And then there was the drive to London complete with pumping UK garage soundtrack. The people you meet when you don't have a gun. </p> <p>According to Equinox, lack of control over one's situation, perinatal factors, the method of one's delivery into the world, and new technology all factor in our stress levels, though no one component is as important as the way we handle stress. In that respect, there is a big Victor Meldrew within some of us. </p> <p>What better way to unwind than watching <strong> Tweenies</strong> (BBC2)? Pretty much any other way you can imagine, actually. Muppet-ish characters with tiny hands and enormous feet, giant red dogs (that talk), a purple spongy woman called Judy who started explaining similes, and a clock that wasn't a clock at all, Tweenies is like the hallucination sequences in Jacob's Ladder. I wouldn't be surprised if Tim Robbins is lying comatose in their bathroom. </p> <p>The gang - Bella, Milo, Jake and Fist (I may have misheard that last one) - consulted their weird clock-not-clock and lo, it was time for a singsong. This Old Man (He Played One) was their choice of chorus and it was all fine - drums, shoes, knees, doors - until they reached five, at which point this old man, he played knick-knack on \"my hive\". Only it wasn't a hive at all. Or even hives (which, covered in all that man-made fibre, may be plentiful on the people inside the Tweeny costumes). It was a vase. A blue vase. I think that's asking too much of the audience to imagine a blue vase as a beehive, don't you? Even with the buzzing noises Fist and her less aggressively-named chums were making. Couldn't they have picked a cream vase or, even better, a Habitat lampshade that at least resembled a hive? Should the Tweenies be encouraging children to pick up beehives and play knick-knack on them in the first place? That's how accidents happen. And if that weren't enough to make you yodel, this old man died at seven (playing knick-knack up to heaven) only to return to earth for eight, nine and ten (gates, lines and hens respectively). No wonder children are confused.</p>",
  "A last-minute legal move in the case of the conjoined twins Jodie and Mary could halt the operation to separate them and send the case on appeal to the House of Lords. <p>Lawyers for Bruno Quintavalle, director of the Prolife Alliance, filed papers at the high court yesterday to try to remove the official solicitor, Laurence Oates, as Mary's guardian, in an attempt to take the case to the law lords. </p> <p>Last month the court of appeal ruled that an operation to separate the twin girls could go ahead. Mr Oates and the twins' parents were given permission to take the case higher, but decided against it. </p> <p>The alliance was allowed to file written submissions with the appeal court arguing that the operation should not take place. The case is provisionally listed to be heard on Friday. </p> <p>The intervention is likely to delay the operation, which had been set to take place in the second week of November at St Mary's hospital, Manchester, where the twins are being cared for. Their parents, from Gozo, had opposed the operation, arguing that God's will should prevail, but have now become reconciled to it. </p> <p>The operation would inevitably end the life of Mary, the weaker twin, but it would give Jodie, the stronger, the chance of a relatively normal life. Without an operation, both twins will die.</p>",
  "Directors and senior executives of British American Tobacco will be formally questioned this week by Department of Trade and Industry investigators after the government ordered an inquiry into allegations that the corporation orchestrated cigarette smuggling. <p>A three-man Whitehall team descended on the central London head office of the world's second biggest tobacco firm at 9am yesterday to start interviewing key personnel and study hundreds of confidential internal reports after giving the company only a few minutes warning in a telephone call. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, has the power to pass files to the police, customs or crown prosecution service if the inspectors from his department's company law and investigations directorate discover any evidence of wrongdoing. </p> <p>Mr Byers acted after the Commons health committee recommended an investiga tion following the Guardian's disclosure last January that BAT's own documents revealed how it had secretly condoned tax evasion and exploited widespread smuggling in Latin America and Asia, benefiting from black marketeering on a massive scale. </p> <p>Anti-smoking campaigners applauded the intervention which comes as tobacco firms face action by the European commission and US administration, hailing it as a \"turning point\" in the battle against smuggling, which boosts sales as tax-free cigarettes are sold cheaply, undermining the health and economic policies of governments. </p> <p>BAT said it was disappointed by the decision but pledged to cooperate with the inspectors, who are expected to spend a week in its headquarters before producing a preliminary report early next year. </p> <p>\"We will, of course, cooperate fully with the investigators but will be making no further comments during the course of their work,\" BAT said. </p> <p>Among those certain to be questioned are Ulrich Herter, managing director, and Keith Dunt, finance director, who were named in BAT documents dating up to 1995 published by the Guardian, as well as Martin Broughton, the current chairman. Kenneth Clarke, the former Tory chancellor and health secretary who is now a part-time deputy chairman, may also be quizzed. Mr Clarke made no public comment. </p> <p>Mr Byers appointed the inspectors under section 447 of the Companies Act 1985 and they have the power to order BAT to release documents and provide explanations, backed up by the threat of legal action against a director or executive suspected of being obstructive. </p> <p>Legal experts believe a prosecution in this country for activities abroad is highly unlikely since most of the allegations of smuggling relate to the 1980s and 1990s while the Criminal Justice(Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act, which makes it an offence to conspire to commit crimes outside the European Union, did not come into force until September 1999.</p>",
  "Bloodshed returned to the heart of Arab East Jerusalem yesterday when an Israeli security guard was shot dead, tightening the siege of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, as he faced a hostile opening session of parliament. <p>Two armed guards from a private firm were shot in the head at close range inside a branch of the National Insurance Institute, which is responsible for Israel's social services. </p> <p>The office is less than 100 metres from one of the city's biggest police stations. </p> <p>One man died instantly, the first Jew to be killed in Jerusalem since the uprising began, and the second was seriously wounded. </p> <p>Shopkeepers said a man fired six shots from a handgun before disappearing into the busy lunchtime crowds. The guards did not return fire. </p> <p>The office has not been fully operational for a couple of months because of a strike. It is not normally open on Mondays, adding to the impression that it was a very well planned operation. </p> <p>The attack, and the discovery hours earlier of the bound and stabbed body of an Israeli man in a river bed near a Jewish settlement on the southern fringes of the city, were an unmistakable challenge to Mr Barak. </p> <p>After a month in which more than 140 Palestinians have died in confrontations with Israeli soldiers, the intifada is becoming a guerrilla war. Armed Palestinian cells intend to take their struggle to Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of their unborn state. </p> <p>Mr Barak has never looked weaker. Hours after the killings, at the opening of the winter session of parliament, he was heck led constantly by Israeli Arab members, and by rightwing opponents. </p> <p>One Arab MP held up pictures of Palestinian children killed in the last month and a rightwing MP screamed: \"You are sacrificing your children to be martyrs.\" </p> <p>The unruly scenes drowned out much of Mr Barak's address. \"You will find us united against violence,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Negotiations are conducted around a table, not in the streets and not with shooting and stones. There will be no prize for violence.\" </p> <p>But there was also no sign of unity. Mr Barak sat alone. Labour MPs, including the former prime minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres, refused to sit beside him, or even make eye contact. </p> <p>Mr Barak was facing a further snub last night when MPs were expected to vote against the prime minister's opening address for the first time in Israel's 52 years. </p> <p>Mr Barak offered no new prescriptions for the crisis, dishing up almost verbatim the cliched mixture of threats, and cajolements to Yasser Arafat to return to the peace process, which has been dead for weeks. </p> <p>Events also appeared to be moving too fast for the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, whose visit to the Jerusalem compound housing the al-Aqsa mosque on September 28 ignited Palestinian anger. Yesterday he told parliament he remained open to the idea of joining an emergency government. </p> <p>The Knesset appeared in no mood to listen. Arab MPs screamed back: \"You are the man who lit the match.\" </p> <p>After weeks of negotiation, the prospect of an emergency government being formed was receding yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Barak is calculating that he can keep his minority government afloat with the Shas party, which has promised its support for one month provided he shelves plans for secular reform and bars two leftwing secular parties from the coalition. </p> <p>The conditional reprieve is a meagre consolation for Mr Barak after yesterday's killings in occupied parts of Jerusalem. </p> <p>But even as the battle for Jerusalem arrived on his doorstep, there was no sign of a let-up in the pitched battles that have convulsed the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>In Yabed, in the West Bank, 1,000 villagers mourned the death of two young Palestinian brothers, Bilal and Hilal Abu Salah, killed by Israeli soldiers in clashes on Sunday. </p> <p>Bilal, 20, was shot in the head and Hilal, 19, who was found only five metres from where his brother fell, died five hours later from a bullet wound to the throat. </p> <p>In Gaza Israeli tanks shelled stone-throwers near the Egyptian border during widespread clashes in which at least nine Palestinians were injured. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english/\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) <br></a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "Destinies can be shaped in unlikely ways. The chain of events that led 24-year-old Vivek Bhardowaj to a converted factory in east Berlin is more ironic than most. As he was studying for his finals at the Punjab Technical University earlier this year, a politician 4,000 miles away in the Rhineland was looking for a way to boost his regional election campaign. J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers of the Christian Democrat Union attacked the centre-left German government's plan to import up to 20,000 computer experts from the developing world. Germany, he said, needed better education, not more immigrants. Someone with an ear for a rhyme summed up his approach as Kinder statt Inder (Children not Indians). <p>A Berlin start-up, Datango, which was opening a jobs page on its website, seized on the controversy with its own jokey slogan: Sind Sie Inder ? (Are you an Indian?). A T-shirt with the slogan and the web address of Datango's jobs page appeared at an IT exhibition and up in the pages of the Times of India. Datango received 130 applications, one from Mr Bhardowaj. </p> <p>The arrival in Germany of Mr Bhardowaj and thousands like him has sparked an explosive debate that touches on labour needs, educational failure and race. </p> <p> <b> Tighter controls</b><br> The Christian Democrats are debating whether to follow Mr R\u00fcttgers' lead and make an anti-immigration stance the focus of their 2002 general election campaign. Yesterday two conservative parliamentary leaders vowed to follow his example and press ahead with plans to seek tighter immigration controls, despite warnings that they are playing with fire. </p> <p>Fredrich Merz and Michael Glos said there was widespread concern about uncontrolled immigration. </p> <p>\"It's not an issue that is being artificially whipped up for an election campaign,\" said Mr Glos, parliamentary floor leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union. \"It's a topic that the public is concerned about and it has to be resolved. Declaring it taboo is the same as saying, 'The public is too dumb for this.'\" </p> <p>The launch of the scheme that attracted Mr Bhardowaj to Germany has made the choice more difficult than it would have been a few months ago: it has inverted the terms of a debate in which the right have traditionally enjoyed a natural advantage. </p> <p>\"In the past we always discussed immigration in terms of how we could avoid bringing people into Germany,\" Thomas Mickeleit, spokesman for IBM Deutschland, said. \"Now, we're talking about the opposite.\" </p> <p>His own company's support for the scheme highlights another important novelty: that in this debate the right cannot count on support from its natural allies in business. Indeed, the government's plan grew out of a dinner for IT company bosses in February given by the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. </p> <p>It lets computer experts live and work in Germany for up to five years provided they have either a university degree or the offer of a job paying more than DM100,000 (about \u00a330,000) a year. The press dubbed it the \"green card\" scheme. </p> <p>Hans Mader, the official in charge, said that in its first 10 weeks of operation, 2,261 people had been placed: to some a disappointing result. But, Mr Mickeleit, said, scheme and the debate should not be confused. \"The number of Germans applying for courses in engineering sciences and IT has doubled since it began. It has become obvious to the public that there is a gap in their economy.\" </p> <p>But behind the green card plan looms the question of whether Germany, like other European states, needs to import not thousands but millions of workers. Could Germany cope without an outburst of xenophobic resentment? </p> <p>Mr Bhardowaj's first impression of Berlin was overwhelmingly positive. But he has been in Germany only a short time. </p> <p>Jarnail and Ramona Singh have different experiences to recount. They, too, live in Berlin, having fled from the eastern town of Meerane, where they ran a restaurant. </p> <p>On September 30, after a dispute with their neighbours, their premises were stormed by a howling drunken mob. </p> <p>Racism and racist violence are scarcely unique to Germany, but there are several reasons why Germany is likely to find the transition to a multi-ethnic society more difficult than other western European countries. </p> <p>For a start, it now includes the formerly communist east - a region in which, until just 10 years ago, the imposition of socialism was held to have obviated the need for a thorough reckoning with the racist past. </p> <p>While the level of racial violence in the west is comparable with that elsewhere in western Europe, in eastern Germany it is four times the level of that in Britain, according to conservative official estimates. </p> <p>In Germany there is an exceptionally close link in the public mind between nationality and ethnicity. Only this year have those born in Germany gained the automatic right to become Germans if their parents were born elsewhere. To most other Germans the 7m who belong to ethnic minorities are Ausl\u00e4nder (foreigners). </p> <p>For decades the main parties insisted that Germany was \"not a country of immigration\". The foreigners who arrived as cheap labour were not immigrants but Gastarbeiter (guest workers). And, like guests, they were expected to leave when no longer welcome. </p> <p>Several consequences flowed from this fundamental self-delusion. One was that when immigration rose again in the 80s it was dealt with not by a modern immigration act but by bending the asylum laws. </p> <p> <b> Just like apartheid</b><br> As Mr Schr\u00f6der and the captains of hi-tech industries sat down to their dinner, Christopher Nsoh was drafting an open letter to highlight the grievances of asylum seekers. </p> <p>\"We cannot work. We cannot study. And we cannot travel,\" Mr Nsoh, a lawyer from Cameroon who lives in a hostel in the eastern town of Rathenow, explained. \"If we want to go more than 60 miles outside the boundaries of our Landkreis [borough] then we need permission from the immigration officer. It is just like South Africa before the fall of apartheid.\" </p> <p>To add to their problems, asylum seekers are favourite targets for neo-Nazi skinheads. \"I've tried going out at night three times in Rathenow and I've been assaulted each time,\" Mr Nsoh said. \"[It is] racism on the streets, racism in the institutions and racism in the law.\" </p> <p>The green card initiative has undoubtedly helped to change perceptions. It has made the point that immigrants are a boon, not a burden. At the same time it is helping to sustain the old myth that one day, if circumstances change, the foreigners may all go home and leave Germany to the Germans. The green cardholders, with their five-year work permits, are ultimately modern hi-tech guest workers.</p>",
  "An arms dealer whose conviction for selling machine guns to Iraq was quashed after evidence emerged that senior Foreign Office and customs officials had interfered in his trial has been awarded more than \u00a31m in compensation. <p>Alexander Schlesinger, sales consultant to Atlantic Commercial, based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, has been awarded \u00a31.375m plus costs under the Home Office compensation scheme for miscarriages of justice. </p> <p>The sum was agreed by Jack Straw, the home secretary, on the advice of an independent assessor who took into account the seniority of diplomats and customs officers whose conduct was described by Sir Richard Scott, chairman of the arms-to-Iraq inquiry, as disgraceful. </p> <p>The claim is the latest in a series made by individuals and companies whose wrongful convictions for selling weapons to Iraq have already cost taxpayers more than \u00a34m. The final total is likely to be far higher. </p> <p>Mr Schlesinger was fined \u00a33,000 in 1985 for his part in the sale of 200 Sterling submachine guns to Iraq via Jordan. With Reginald Dunk, director of Atlantic Commercial, he pleaded guilty after diplomats at the Jordanian and Iraqi embassies in London reneged on their promises to appear as witnesses for the defence. The diplomats had said the guns were a gift from Iraq to Jordan. </p> <p>Documents released to the Scott inquiry revealed that, at the behest of customs, senior British diplomats agreed to have \"friendly words\" with the Iraqi and Jordanian ambassadors. One document said: \"I confess to innocent reluctance to connive at impeding the course of justice!\" </p> <p>In 1994 Lord Taylor, then lord chief justice, said what he called the \"machinations\" in the case \"to prevent witnesses for the defence being available, coupled with the non-disclosure of what had been done, constituted such an interference with the justice process as to amount to an abuse of it\". </p> <p>Last year Mr Dunk, who has since died, was awarded \u00a32.15m in compensation for miscarriage of justice, loss of business - his company collapsed - and personal distress. </p> <p>Mr Schlesinger and Mr Dunk also received \u00a3125,000 in an unprecedented settlement arising from the conduct of two senior diplomats, Cartsen Pigott and Patrick Nixon, in the arms case. </p> <p>The dealers accused them of \"abuse of public office\". It was the first compensation where damages were recovered from a government department criticised in the Scott report. The FO maintained the payment was \"without any admission of liability\". </p> <p>Mr Schlesinger, 58, said last night: \"I am relieved that after 17 years of fighting to clear my name and to obtain compensation, this is finally all over.\" If it had not been for Sir Richard Scott and the late Lord Taylor, \"the wrongful conviction would not have been quashed\", he said. </p> <p>\"My business and personal life has been destroyed and I have been denied the opportunity of a fair trial and the chance to clear my name.\" </p> <p>His lawyer, Lawrence Kormornick, said: \" This was a serious case about human rights, the rule of law and government accountability.\" He regretted that neither customs nor the FO had apologised. </p> <p>Mr Kormornick is now seeking compensation for Paul Henderson and Peter Allen, former directors of Matrix Churchill machine tools company, whose arms-to-Iraq trial collapsed after evidence emerged that the then Conservative government had turned a blind eye to the sale of arms-related equipment to Saddam Hussein in the 1980s. </p> <p>Mr Kormornick is also claiming compensation for Ali Daghir, director of Euromac, who was convicted in 1991 for supplying \"nuclear capacitors\" - equipment used to store and release energy - to Iraq. His conviction was quashed after the appeal court ruled that the trial judge had misdirected the jury. </p> <p>Paul Grecian, director of Ordtec, a military engineering company, is seeking compensation after his conviction for trying to sell equipment to Iraq was quashed. The appeal court found that crucial documents were not passed to the defence. </p> <p>The total bill for miscarriages of justice arising out of arms-to-Iraq scandals could amount to \u00a330m, including legal and court costs, Mr Kormornick said yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>In Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, 12 members of a local youth group have hit the headlines by helping to cut burglaries. They spent a weekend making elderly people's bungalows more secure by fitting more than 300 special ceiling alarms in their bedrooms. The tactic has already worked, putting off thieves who liked to strike in the early evening when people were watching soap operas on television. </p> <p>This success fits in with recent national crime figures, which show a 21% cut in burglaries, partly because more people are putting security devices in their homes. </p> <p> <strong> What are these new crime figures?</strong> </p> <p> They are part of the eighth British Crime Survey (BCS). This is published every two years. It is important because it reflects the views of 19,000 people aged over 16, who are quizzed about the crimes they have experienced and not just the crimes they have reported. It's thought to give a far more accurate picture of what is going on across the country than the six-monthly \"recorded crime\" statistics based on figures from the UK's 43 police force areas. </p> <p>The survey and the police figures do not precisely overlap. There are crimes such as fraud or drug use that do not feature in the survey. But where they do cover the same offences, the statistics show that nearly six in 10 crimes do not get reported. </p> <p> <strong> Why do people not tell the police if a crime is committed against them?</strong> </p> <p> Many people think what has happened to them is too unimportant to mention, or that the police will not be able to do anything. Much more serious are the violent crimes that remain hidden - 65 in every 100 cases. One reason for this may be that many assaults result from violence in the home, which people can prefer to keep private. By far the most frequently reported crimes are those involving cars or burglaries. The obvious reason for this is that a police crime number is needed before people can make an insurance claim. </p> <p> <strong> Does the survey suggest crime is on the increase or not?</strong> </p> <p> There was good news in this year's report - overall the crime figures were 10% down on the 1998 survey. The biggest reductions were in burglaries and thefts from vehicles. The government claims its policies are working. This drop has also appeared in the \"reported crimes\" statistics in each of the last six years. But crime in Britain is still high - far above the level in the early 1980s. For example, burglaries may be down but there are still 1.3m of them a year, putting us top of the international burglary league. </p> <p> <strong> Who is behind many of these crimes?</strong> </p> <p> Young people. The peak time for men to be convicted or cautioned for criminal activity is when they are 18. One in 10 young men of this age end up with a police record. Girls are over four times less likely to get involved in crime and they hit their criminal peak younger, at 15. Overall, teenage offenders commit over 7m offences a year and cost the taxpayer \u00a31bn. The government hopes the Crime and Disorder Act (1998) will tackle these problems by targeting young criminals. </p> <p> <strong> Who are the main victims of these crimes?</strong> </p> <p> Young men between 16 and 24 suffer five times the average number of violent assaults. Robberies also affect young people more, accounting for nearly 12% of the 14% rise in this kind of crime - mobile phones are a particular target. Another worry is that while crime is falling generally, across the country some communities have to live in hotspots where criminal activity is dug in and growing. For example, Nottingham police are routinely patrolling with guns because of shooting incidents on certain housing estates. The other cause for concern is the growth of assaults by strangers, often in pubs and clubs. Often, as with so much crime, alcohol is the root cause. </p> <p> <strong> Is a falling crime level making people feel more secure?</strong> </p> <p> For all sorts of reasons, people still feel crime is getting worse. Anxiety about crime is almost as serious a problem as crime itself. </p> <p> <strong> Curriculum links: citizenship/PSHE </strong> </p> <p><strong>More information:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 For Alcohol and Crime: <a href=\"http://www.alcoholconcern.org.uk\">www.alcoholconcern.org.uk/</a>. </p> <p> \u0095 For a sight of the Crime and Disorder Act (1998): <a href=\"http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980037.htm\">www.hmso.gov.</a>. </p> <p>\u0095 The Police Service: <a href=\"http://www.police.uk/\">www.police.uk/</a> </p> <p>\u0095 To see the BCS and details of the crime prevention programme go to: <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk\">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.

  "<p><strong> Amanda Sandford, research manager, ASH</strong> <br></p> <p>Most schools have a policy on smoking but they vary in scope and degree of enforcement. You should check the school policy and speak to the head or whoever is responsible for enforcing it. Many schools also provide smoking education, but its impact is likely to be reduced if smoking is tolerated within the school premises. </p> <p>Meanwhile, try to find out what prompted your daughter to start smoking. Research suggests that stressing the health dangers to young people rarely convinces them of the need to quit. Instead, expressing your disapproval and serious concern is more important. Even where parents themselves smoke, this can be effective, especially if you show how much you regret starting. </p> <p>You may also like to find out where your daughter got the cigarettes. Although it's not illegal for your child to buy them under 16, it is illegal for shopkeepers etc to sell them to underage buyers. Why not tackle this aspect of the problem first, either alone or with other parents in a similar situation. Cutting off the means of supply could dissuade the \"casual\" smoker from continuing. </p> <p>Many young people who do view themselves as \"casual\" smokers do not know just how addictive nicotine is. Explain to your daughter that she should not underestimate how big a part cigarettes will play in her life if she persists. </p> <p><strong> Health Education Authority spokesperson</strong><br> </p> <p>Anti-smoking activities in schools should be part of a community-wide programme of action. Simply educating young people about the risks of smoking is not enough. Young people are exposed to considerable pressures to smoke at a time when their future health often has a low priority. They must be equipped to resist these pressures. Schools may wish to tackle smoking in various ways, but they will all need a firm commitment to action from teachers, governors and parents. </p> <p>Where one does not already exist, schools should set up a working party and appoint a senior member of staff as smoking policy co-ordinator to work towards establishing a smoke-free school. To assess the extent of the problem, smoking should be monitored regularly, involving anonymous classroom questionnaires and comparisons with national and regional figures. The results should then be communicated to staff, students, parents and governors for discussion. </p> <p>School rules should prohibit smoking by pupils during school hours; prohibit smoking by staff on or near school premises or during school activities; provide for appropriate measures, including support and sanctions, given the addictive and self-destructive nature of smoking; prohibit smoking during school meetings, including governors' meetings and parent-teacher meetings; and clearly explain the rationale behind the policy. </p> <p>A written policy records the school's approach to smoking and what action it is taking. Developing a policy should involve setting down the elements of the school anti-smoking campaign, and developing the draft through discussion with students (a specially constituted group or school council), staff, governors and parents. </p> <p>As well as incorporating smoking-related topics in class teaching, schools should aim to link up with the wider community, eg get involved in national schemes such as No Smoking Day; work more closely with local shopkeepers to reduce sales of cigarettes to pupils. Local health promotion units can often provide useful resources. </p> <p>Specific anti-smoking campaigns are essential in a comprehensive smoking policy. They keep the issue fresh and enable you to vary the point of attack. Different approaches can be considered - discussion groups; posters, signs and poster competitions; presentations; practical demonstrations such as carbon monoxide (smoking breath tests) on pupils; training sessions for resisting pressures to smoke; and a smokers' clinic. </p> <p><strong> Helplines</strong><br> </p> <p>The following offer confidential, freephone services for anyone who wants to stop smoking: </p> <p><strong> Quitline:</strong> tel: 0800 00 22 00; 1pm-9pm every day; also in Bengali, Gujerati, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Turkish and Kurdish on various days<br> </p> <p><strong> Smokeline (Scotland):</strong> tel: 0800 84 84 84; 12pm-12am every day <br></p> <p><strong> Smokers' Quitline (N Ireland): </strong> tel: 02890 66328; 9am-5pm weekdays <br></p> <p><strong> Smokers' Helpline (Wales): </strong> tel: 0345 697 500; 9am-5pm weekdays <br></p> <p><strong> Next week's problem:</strong> My son has missed a lot of school through illness.

  "<p>The final straw for Liz Carnell came when her 12-year-old son John was attacked in a corridor at school. He had been called \"swot\" before, his books had been scribbled on, his pencil case and school bag and rugby kit stolen or destroyed. He had been hit on the head a number of times by another pupil, and had even needed hospital treatment for internal bruising after another boy punched him in the kidneys during a chemistry lesson. On that occasion she had called the police, though they took no action. </p> <p>But after more than a year of torment for John, and what felt like complete indifference from the school, Carnell had had enough. She had visited the school, talked to John's teacher and the headteacher, written, phoned, contacted the governors, written to the local education authority. The school told her: \"We don't have this much trouble with other parents,\" and refused to deal with any specific allegations against the bully. So Carnell took John out of school and kept him at home. She didn't know what else she could do to protect her son. </p> <p>\"We complained in a fairly low-key way to begin with,\" says Carnell, a journalist from Harrogate in Yorkshire. \"I didn't want to make a fuss. But as time went on I got very upset. I used to cry because I didn't know what I had to do to protect John. On one occasion he said to me, 'I wish I was dead.' That's a terrible thing for a parent to have to deal with, to go to work every day knowing that your child is feeling that way.\" The reaction of the school, she says, was \"thoroughly unpleasant\". She says the headteacher told her the bullying must be John's fault. In the end they started legal proceedings against North Yorkshire county council. In 1997, five years after the bullying began, the council paid John \u00a36,000 to settle out of court. </p> <p>Parents and teachers may assume that Carnell's experiences in dealing with her son's bullying are rare, but they would be unwise to be complacent. Last week a 17-year-old boy from Greater Manchester won \u00a31,500 from his local authority because his grammar school was found to be in breach of its duty of care in failing to protect him from being bullied: the first successful legal action over bullying in three decades. </p> <p>Another teenager, Leah Bradford-Smart, now 19, is pursuing a case against West Sussex county council alleging that her school also failed to protect her from persistent bullying. </p> <p>Schools are required by law to have anti-bullying policies, but it appears they will increasingly need to consider the risk of litigation if they cannot satisfy parents. Liz Carnell set up a website after John's case was settled. In less than a year Bullying Online has had 42,000 visitors, and Carnell has responded to 3,700 emails since the site launched in April 1999. A lot of her correspondence, she says, is from parents wanting advice on how to sue their local education authority. </p> <p>Mike McKay knows about the urge to \"go in and blow them all up with a cannon\". When his son Martin was 12, he got a phone call from his ex-wife saying that Martin had tried to kill himself. McKay had not been aware that the boy, who lived with his mother, was being physically bullied and on one occasion had been beaten up with an iron bar. The reaction of the school, he says, was that Martin must have brought it on himself. </p> <p>\"There was one occasion when the whole thing welled up and I was crying and angry and kicking things because I was really, really mad, but I managed to get that rage out of my system. Because of the way the LEA had misinterpreted my son's behaviour, I didn't want to demonstrate too much emotion in case they thought, well it's hardly surprising, his father is off his trolley as well. That's the effect it can have on people.\" </p> <p>Mick Brookes, president of the National Association of Head Teachers and head of a school in Nottinghamshire, agrees McKay's reasoned approach is the best way to deal with the problem. He argues that schools are now much better trained in dealing with bullying. \"In the past schools pretended bullying wasn't happening. Now people realise that it tends to happen everywhere, even in the workplace.\" His view is that no situation of bullying is beyond a solution. \"In my 22 years of being a headteacher I have found that where parents can work together with the school this issue can be cracked every time.\" </p> <p>Liz Carnell will hope he is right. She would like to see local authorities holding training sessions on bullying every year, and heads required to provide information to their governors on the number of complaints about bullying. Schemes to encourage children to support their peers by reporting any bullying should also be encouraged, she says. It is also vital for parents and teachers to be looking for telltale signs, such as cuts and bruises, missing books or repeated visits to the school nurse to try to get out of class. </p> <p>\"Sometimes it can be difficult for parents to tell what is bullying,\" she says. \"When very young children start school they can be in the rough and tumble of the playground and parents don't know whether that constitutes bullying. I would say even then to pop into the school to have a word with the class teacher and hopefully nip it in the bud. It might save a lot of problems in the long run.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Some names have been changed. <br></p> <p> <strong>What parents should do</strong><br></p> <p> \u0095 At the first sign of bullying, ask to see the teacher and explain the situation in a non-confrontational way. Ask them to keep an eye on the situation. </p> <p>\u0095 Ask to see a copy of the school's bullying policy. Procedures for staff, parents and pupils to follow if bullying occurs should be clear and well publicised throughout the school. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep a diary of what your child tells you is happening. </p> <p>\u0095 If the bullying continues, write to the teacher or head of year, asking them to note your concerns on your child's file, together with a note of the action they have taken. </p> <p>\u0095 Write to the headteacher if you are still concerned, outlining everything and including information from the diary to back up your complaint. </p> <p>\u0095 Take your child to a doctor if they are particularly distressed, as medication or counselling may be appropriate. A letter from your doctor to the school will reinforce your case. </p> <p>\u0095 Each time you visit the school take notes, and write after your meeting confirming what you agreed should happen next. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are still unhappy, contact the chair of governors. You are entitled to see a copy of your child's school record within 15 school days. </p> <p>\u0095 The last resort is to make a formal complaint to the local authority, the local government ombudsman, your MP and ultimately the secretary of state, David Blunkett. </p> <p> <strong> Web links</strong><br></p> <p> The Department for Education and Employment: <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk\">www.dfee.gov.uk</a> <br></p> <p> The National Association of Head Teachers: <a href=\"http://www.naht.org.uk\">www.naht.org.uk</a><br></p> <p> Bullying Online: <a href=\"http://www.bullying.co.uk\">www.bullying.co.uk</a> <br></p> <p> Parentline Plus: <a href=\"http://www.parentlineplus.org.uk\">www.parentlineplus.org.uk</a>, helpline 0808 800 2222 <br></p> <p> A site by George Robinson and Barbara Maines, whose materials are well-regarded: <a href=\"http://www.luckyduck.co.uk\">www.luckyduck.co.uk</a><br></p> <p> Kidscape, a child safety charity: <a href=\"http://www.educate.co.uk/bull2.htm#top\">www.educate.co.uk/bull2.htm#top</a> <br></p> <p> Childline's advice for parents of bullies as well as of bullied children: <a href=\"http://www.childline.org.uk/\"> www.childline.org.ukl</a> <br></p> <p> The BBC's anti-bullying site: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/bully/\">www.bbc.co.uk/education/bully/</a></p>",
  "<p>When is a slap not a slap? When it's administered by a teacher in \"exceptional circumstances, where there is an immediate risk of injury\", according to Section 550a of the Education Act 1996: then, it becomes \"reasonable force\". To prevent a pupil from committing an offence, injuring him/herself or others, damaging property or behaving in a manner likely to disrupt good order, \"a member of the staff of a school may use ... such force as is reasonable.\" </p> <p>The problem - one of many to emerge from the law governing teachers' rights to restrain pupils - comes with that word \"reasonable\". Is it reasonable to hit a child who is scribbling on a desk? What if the child tips that desk over, or throws a chair? What if that child then throws a chair at a teacher, or another pupil? Most parents, and teachers themselves, would say no, that to react to any of these situations with a slap is unacceptable since the abolition of corporal punishment. </p> <p>So, slapping is out. But detentions and threats of treats withdrawn often - as any teacher or, indeed, child will admit - fail to control a pupil intent on causing havoc. Is it then reasonable to lock that pupil in a cupboard, throw water in his or her face, tie two young siblings together with a skipping rope? The regulations here are not so much a grey area as a black hole. </p> <p>The above incidents were all alleged to have taken place at St Mary's primary school in Caldicot, Wales, where headteacher Marjorie Evans is soon to restart her career after 13 months of suspension. Accusations that she had slapped an unruly pupil were cast out at the Court of Appeal last month; no charges will be brought in relation to the other claims. </p> <p>Evans robustly denies accusations that she has mistreated pupils, but happily concedes that the \"skipping rope\" incident did happen. The loose tying together of wrists while the two, a brother and sister, were in a group taking part in a sponsored walk was, she insists, done for the protection of both of them - staff were worried that the boy could have run into the road and been hit by a car. It was carried out, says Evans, in a jovial manner: the children themselves were amused, and their mother has expressed her support for the school. </p> <p>Others involved in the care of children aren't so sure that such measures are as harmless as they might first appear. \"It's outrageous,\" says Carolyn Hamilton of the Children's Legal Centre. \"Tying children together definitely crosses the line. Force can only be used in very specific circumstances, ones in which children will pose a danger. Restraint is not appropriate for small children being naughty.\" </p> <p>Many teachers are not so certain. When faced with very difficult behaviour, many are unsure about the severity of any sanctions, and are afraid that if they inadvertently overstep the line they could face charges of abuse. And, reading the guidelines issued by the Department for Education and Employment in September 1998 in an attempt to clarify the 1996 Act, is it any wonder? </p> <p>\"There is no legal definition of 'reasonable force'\", the guidelines state, \"so it is not possible to set out comprehensively when it is reasonable to use force, or the degree of force that may reasonably be used. It will always depend on the circumstances.\" </p> <p>So it remains a matter of interpretation. \"Three years ago you couldn't do anything at all - it had almost got to the point where you had to stand back if a child was violent,\" says Roger Alexander, who was headteacher at a \"fairly tough\" primary school for 13 years. \"After various attacks on teachers, it's now agreed that you can use reasonable force to protect yourself, the child, or another child,\" he explains. </p> <p>So, was it acceptable to tether two children to each other with a rope? Definitely not, in his opinion. \"It just wouldn't work. It's like putting two fireworks side by side. What you need to do is attach - not literally - one child to one teacher and the other to another teacher. It sends a message to the other kids and isolates the ones causing the problems.\" </p> <p>Fiona Campbell, a primary school teacher from Sheffield, agrees. \"There is no place in education for such a humiliating thing,\" she insists. \"What worries me is that people will think this sort of thing regularly goes on in schools, but it doesn't and shouldn't.\" She admits that teachers can be pushed to the limits by the more challenging children, but argues that there are other ways to deal with such a situation. \"The key thing is safety. If you think that children will be unsafe on a sponsored walk, then you don't take them, even if it means that the whole class doesn't go.\" </p> <p>One problem for primary teachers in particular is that there are very few sanctions available to them. Young children cannot be detained after school. Removing the child from a classroom is only a short-term solution. Very quickly, the teacher can find that he or she has run out of disciplinary measures to control a child who simply will not stop misbehaving. </p> <p>Often, says Alexander, the teacher's situation is complicated by the fact that parents can be blind to their child's faults. Conversely, there are parents who are all too keen for teachers to take a firm hand with their offspring. Parents like Robert Whelan, director of Family and Youth Concern (FYC). \"A smack brings a problem to a conclusion,\" he says. So what do parents like this think of more moderate sanctions, such as the use of a skipping rope as a restraint? \"The law should not be brought to bear on a teacher who is doing her job,\" Whelan says without hesitation. \"It is up to parents to decide whether methods of discipline are acceptable. The parents in the skipping rope case supported Marjorie Evans, but she has not been supported by the system. If the parents agree, let that be an end to it. Those who don't can find another school to send their children to.\" </p> <p>But shouldn't parents be able to send their children to school in the knowledge that physical force will not be used against them? \"I'd go mad if a teacher did that to my daughter,\" says Tom Carney, who has three children aged between 10 and 21. \"There should still be punishment in schools - and I think there's still room for the cane if a kid is really naughty - but there's got to be a line you don't cross.\" </p> <p>If a child is not physically harmed, it can be easy to overlook the fact that force has been used. Paula Woodhurst recalls an incident when her son, now 21, told her that his teacher had grabbed his tie and pushed him against a wall. \"I told him he probably deserved it, because I knew what a horror he could be,\" she says. \"I should have gone up to the school, but I had sympathy for the teacher.\" </p> <p>DfEE guidelines dictate that detailed records should be kept of all incidents where force is used, and that parents should be invited to discuss it. This does not, however, allow the child the same opportunity. Children often have different ideas from adults about what can \"reasonably\" be done to them. Humiliation, after all, can be as distressing as pain. </p> <p>\"I would have felt worried, and afraid of what she was going to do next,\" says Jasmine, eight, of the skipping rope solution. \"I've never seen it done, and it shouldn't be allowed. It's not funny.\" Matthew, 12, agrees that \"it wouldn't be right,\" but concedes that \"it's a bit funny, but then it isn't really. It probably causes pain. It's probably embarrassing. And it's illegal, isn't it?\" </p> <p>Both children appreciate that pupils can wind their teachers up to the point where tempers are lost and lessons are wasted. \"There is a boy in my class who annoys the teacher, and it affects the whole class, stops us from learning,\" explains Matthew. </p> <p>The recognition that children be protected from violence has meant there is no longer any place in the classroom for the cane. It has also meant that there is little room for error on the part of teachers. At a briefing for heads, Alexander recalls being warned that few teachers could expect to retire without having been suspended at least once. Official figures indicate that such measures are still rare - the National Union of Teachers registered 120 allegations against teachers last year, of which 60% were proved false. But teachers can feel as if they are under siege: \"If a child makes a claim, then you're guilty until proven innocent. The automatic procedures just kick in.\" </p> <p>They certainly did for Sarah Foster. She too was falsely accused of assaulting a pupil, at the infant school at which she is head. She was interviewed (and photographed, and finger-printed) by police. Within 24 hours, the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was no case to answer. Nevertheless, she was suspended by the local authority while it carried out its own investigation; she was reinstated two weeks later. The child remains on the site. </p> <p>\"I still feel devastated. There is very little support for teachers. You get complaints from parents whose children have been kicked and thumped by difficult pupils, and you realise that those complaints are justified. You need to remove a child from a situation when he is disruptive, but teachers are wary about stepping in.\" </p> <p>On Thursday, the NUT will unveil its new guidelines to teachers. They promise to go beyond the advice offered by the DfEE, which many teachers find impractical. \"Teachers need more protection and more clarity,\" agrees Foster. \"At the moment, the code of conduct is just not detailed enough. Everything seems to be working against the teacher.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Some names have been changed.</p>",
  "Despite all the complaints about the difficulty of falling in love with either Al Gore or George W Bush, these two very different men have delivered a clean, well-argued campaign that offers a choice between two sharply contrasting visions of the future. <p>This is the first presidential campaign in recent history centred on an argument over how best to use real resources to address age-old domestic problems while also defining the United States' role in a world evermore dependent on it for farsighted international leadership. </p> <p>Having listened to their debate, we today firmly endorse Al Gore as the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making, and his devotion to the general welfare. </p> <p>We offer this endorsement knowing that Mr Bush is not without his strong points and that Mr Gore has his weaknesses. </p> <p>We commend Mr Bush for running a largely positive, inclusive campaign. He has not played on divisive social themes as his father did in 1988. But on women's rights, guns and law-enforcement issues, he has a harsh agenda, and the centrepiece of his domestic programme is a lavish tax cut for the rich that would negate the next Congress's once-in-a-century opportunity to move the country toward universal health care and stabilisation of social security and Medicare. </p> <p>Preserving the nation's remarkable prosperity must be considered the thematic spine of this election. Mr Gore promises to maintain fiscal rigour while using the surplus on spending programmes and tax breaks for the working families that profited least from the biggest boom in American history. </p> <p>Mr Bush's entire economic programme is built on a stunning combination of social inequity and flawed economic theory. </p> <p>Most citizens know that Mr Gore wins any comparison with Mr Bush on experience and knowledge. Yet many voters seem more comfortable with Mr Bush's personality and are tempted to gamble on him. We do not dismiss this desire for someone who they feel does not talk down to them. </p> <p>But it is important to remember that the nation's prosperity, its environmental progress and its guarantees of civil rights and reproductive freedom took years to build. </p> <p>They could be undone in a flash by a pliable and inexperienced president driven by a highly ideological Congress.</p>",

  "Three people were killed and dozens more injured when a huge car bomb exploded in central Madrid at rush hour yesterday, the bloodiest attack attributed to the Basque separatist group Eta since it broke its ceasefire at the beginning of the year. <p>The bomb, detonated by remote control, exploded when General Jose Francisco Querol, a 69-year-old high court judge, assigned to the military tribunal, was driving past on his way to work. The general, his chauffeur and police bodyguard were killed as his car catapulted into the air and flew over a bus. </p> <p>The driver of the bus, two passengers and two passers-by, including an 11-year-old girl, were badly injured. Emergency workers treated a further 60 people in a field hospital set up nearby. </p> <p>The explosion, just after 9am, turned a residential street in the north of the city into a scene of carnage as victims cried for help and ambulances struggled to reach them through dense smoke, burning cars and debris from shattered buildings. </p> <p>The bombing, which bore all the hallmarks of Eta, brought the number of people killed by the group so far this year to 19. </p> <p>Querol, a soldier and a judge, belonged to two of the professions most often attacked by the organisation, which has also killed several politicians and journalists. </p> <p>\"Eta chooses its victims among the defenders of the rule of law because it wants to subvert it. For that reason all Spaniards should feel they are victims too and stand firm,\" said the defence minister, Federico Trillo, a close personal friend of the dead judge. </p> <p>The attack marks an escalation in Eta violence. In its current campaign it had singled out specific targets but avoided injury to passers-by. Most of its victims have been shot at close range. </p> <p>This time the bomb, thought by police to contain up to 30kg of dynamite, went off 25 metres from Querol's home when his car had stopped at traffic lights and was bound to be surrounded by people. </p> <p>It recalled the worst days of Eta's random bombing in the early 1980s and took place near the spot where the group tried to kill the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, with a similar car bomb in 1995. </p> <p>The Basque regional government, led by the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), was quick to condemn the attack. \"Eta's talk of democracy is a travesty,\" its chief spokesman said. \"It has no idea of what democracy is and seeks only to blackmail and destroy.\" </p> <p>Mr Aznar has accused the PNV of being soft on terrorism after it signed an agreement with Eta in 1998 to work together for an independent state in return for an end to violence. Mr Aznar insists that he will make no political concessions to Eta in return for an end to violence. </p> <p>He argues that Basques are free to pursue any political aims through institutions set up 25 years ago when Spain became a highly devolved democracy. Eta has killed just over 800 people since it began its violent campaign for an independent state in 1968.</p>",
  "Tony Blair held talks with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, last night as the two governments intensified their efforts to save the Northern Ireland peace process from collapse. <p>With republicans and unionists trading bitter recriminations in Belfast, the two prime ministers spoke of their determination to shore up the Good Friday agreement. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, who will hold talks this week with the Irish foreign minister, Brian Cowen, attempted to focus minds. Speaking in Omagh, he said: \"If we lose it, there will be no replacement, no second chance, no coming back. It is now or never for this agreement and that's why people have really got to devote themselves to making it work.\" </p> <p>There were no signs of common ground, however, after David Trimble, first minister and leader of the Ulster Unionists, unveiled plans at the weekend to block Sinn Fein's two ministers from attending meetings of a cross-border ministerial council. His move was designed to punish Sinn Fein for the IRA's \"failure\" to disarm. </p> <p>Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's education minister, called for an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive as he pledged to attend meetings of the north-south ministerial council. \"It is hurtful to me to be told two days after an executive meeting that you do not count,\" he said. </p> <p>Sir Reg Empey, the Ulster Unionists' enterprise minister, said that republicans had created the crisis. \"The unionist community is turning against this agreement because it has not been implemented fairly,\" he said. </p> <p>With no sign of an end to the recriminations in Belfast, all sides agree that it is up to the British and Irish governments to rescue the peace process. Mr McGuinness underlined the expectations when he said: \"We want to hear how they are going to face down those people who want to drag us back to the bad old days.\" </p> <p>The London-Dublin axis has proved to be a crucial element in nursing the peace process through repeated crises. However, relations between the two governments have deteriorated over the past year. </p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Ahern, who spoke for 30 minutes last night on the telephone, still enjoy warm relations. But lower down the chain, where the day-to-day Anglo-Irish work is carried out, relations are frosty. </p> <p>Officials say it is an open secret that Mr Mandelson and Mr Cowen do not get on. A leaked Northern Ireland Office memo, which is said to have reflected the thinking of Mr Mandelson, accused Mr Cowen earlier this year of attempting to strip the province of its British identity. </p> <p>Their relations are unlikely to get any warmer when Mr Mandelson suggests to Mr Cowen that the international disarmament commission should play a more active role. Irish officials are wary of compromising the independence of the commission. </p> <p>Relations have turned sour principally because Dublin believes that Mr Mandelson has moved too far towards unionists in implementing the Patten report on policing. Irish officials are angry that the legislation enacting the reforms keeps alive memories of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. </p> <p>British sources insist that Mr Mandelson has gone out of his way to \"strike the balance which was at the heart of Patten\". This has involved radical changes - including a new name - while making clear that the RUC is not being disbanded.</p>",

  "<p>Painting the Century ambles through the ground floor galleries and corridors of the National Portrait Gallery. A picture a year for the century: 101 works, from 1900 to the millennium. It is a journey through styles and movements, an incomplete and inconclusive story. The exhibition can't quite make up its mind whether it is a show of the century's portraits, or of portraits of the century. </p> <p>As the exhibition's curator, Robin Gibson, says, this is not an anthology of the century's greatest portraits. Hence, I suppose, no Antonin Artaud, for example, and no Pierre Bonnard; instead, Hans Haake's Maggie Thatcher is here, as well as Michael J Browne's Eric Cantona, for what he's worth. Exhibitions are almost invariably constrained by what is available. There are a few great paintings - Picasso's 1905 Woman in a Chemise, Warhol's Double Elvis, a great lumpen, cyclops-eyed Philip Guston of a man smoking (the 20th century was the century of smoking) - but perhaps it doesn't always take great artists and great subjects to reveal a moment, the spirit of an age, its texture and tone. In fact, mediocrity, or at least minor art, often does just as well - at telling a story, recalling the atmosphere of an epoch. </p> <p>There are interesting oddball things. George Gershwin's 1934 self-portrait, his hand like a paw, his face self-caricatured against musical staves; Isaac Brodsky's lonely Lenin in Red Square, in working-man's clothes, the crowds milling miles away across the stones; and some works which really have no place in any exhibition at all. Stephen Finer's wretched David Bowie and Iman is one, Charles Wellington Furse's 1903 Gainsborough-esque portrait of his wife Diana, out with the greyhounds on a windy day, another. The only notable thing about this piece of Edwardian dung is that Furse's mum crouched behind her daughter-in-law as the artist painted her, blowing air up Diana's skirts with a bellows to achieve the required windy day effect. </p> <p>I find I have written \"AAARGH\" all over the catalogue page featuring Lovis Corinth's 1911 portrait of zoo owner Carl Hagenbeck. The zoo-owner rests a proprietorial hand on a great mustachioed walrus, who, with beady eye and hairy maw, seems intent on Hagenbeck's crotch. What perversity led the curator to ship this picture all the way from Hamburg? Maybe he simply wanted us to be astounded. </p> <p>The ludicrous aside, there are certain paintings here whose dramatised truths seem to provide the exact feel of their time. German painter George Scholz's self-portrait, standing in front of an advertising column, is the quintessential man in the street, a petit bourgouis in the gloom. I love this painting's quiet, the way Scholz meets us with a quizzical eye on the corner as we pass. Later, in 1940, when Scholz has retreated from public life to a small provincial German town, we meet Felix Nussbaum, who was interned in France in 1940, and later deported and killed at Auschwitz. Nussbaum portrays himself in rags in a camp, on a wretchedly bleak and bone-strewn patch of ground between the huts. I flashback to Scholz, buttoned-up warm against the cold, his collar clean, his tie neat. Perhaps one of the problems of this show is that there are too many possible stories, too many conections to be made. </p> <p>I also think of works which are not here, but ought to be: Hitler in armour, carrying a banner, by Lanzinger; Adolf Wissel's creepy National Socialist happy family group portrait, and Felix Nussbaum's 1943 self-portrait, holding up his Judenpass. Instead, for 1943, we have Meredith Frampton's remarkable painting of the London Civil Defence Control Room in South Kensington. This is no Dad's Army gag. Three senior civil defence officers are painted in their underground centre of operations: maps on the wall, memos and notes everywhere, a teacup on the table. It is a painting of details - a pint of milk, the red and cream coloured telephones, the dangling flex and sallow artificial light. Frampton really captures the dim electric light. Everything, including the sitters, seems to be made of Bakelite. It is all rendered with a hypnotic acuity which borders on the surreal. Peculiar and full of atmosphere, this unnaturally impeturbable scene could be viewed as stiff-upper-lip propa ganda, but somehow none of this makes this painting a failure as art. </p> <p>Suddenly, war is over and here's the Belgian poet and mescaline- eating artist Henri Michaux, painted by Dubuffet. We are back in the realms of modern art. But it is a fitful journey, which takes us to Dali-land and back, via New York, where Ben Shahn paints Dag Hammarskjold penning a speech to the UN, and on to the London Soho bohemia of the Colony Room, by Michael Andrews. It is 1962 now, but the Colony hasn't changed a jot. Only the denizens of the club have changed. They're all dead: Jeffrey and Bruce Bernard, Francis Bacon, the awful barman Ian Board. The Colony Room is set not so much in aspic as in fag ash and whisky. </p> <p>One of the last things Bruce Bernard produced, before he died this year, was the monumental book Century, Bernard's own month-by-month anthology of 20th century photography. Photography and film were the media of the past 100 years, and the National Portrait Gallery barely touches the subject. Let photography in, the show seems to concede, and all this painting will have to go. The proliferation of photographic images over the past century - many of which have achieved a more common iconic status than any painting (which is more telling: a movie still of a napalmed girl in Vietnam or Picasso's Guernica?) - has not meant that painting has been downgraded, but that it has become freer to do precisely those things that photography cannot, or could not do, until the advent of the digitalised, infinitely manipulable image. </p> <p>Robert Silvers' 1996 portrait of Bill Gates, composed of a digital mosaic of thousands of banknotes, owes a great deal to the paintings of Chuck Close, but Silvers' portrait isn't a painting. (And what is Cindy Sherman's self-portrait photograph doing here?) Close's own painting here, a black and white, enlarged photorealist portrait of stage designer Robert Israel, is described in the catalogue as \"nice, good-looking and 'preppy'\". His staring eyes and slack mouth make me think he looks mad. But it is as much the distortions of the close-up, the shallow depth of field accentuated by Close's painting of it, that distorts him. </p> <p>Going back to Walter Sickert's 1936 picture Jack and Jill, based on a film still of Edward G Robinson and Joan Blondell in the noir movie Bullets or Ballots, one realises how much photography and the movies have infiltrated and changed painting. Sickert can in some ways be seen as an unacknowledged precursor to many more recent painters who have worked from the photograph. Gerhard Richter's paintings, and especially those dealing with the Baader-Meinhof gang, deserve to be acknowleged here. They are portraits of German society, portraits of guilt, and portraits of our own voyeurism. If not \"portraits of the century\", they remain the most important suite of paintings to have been made in post-war Europe (post-war Germany being, precisely, Richter's subject). </p> <p>A summary of the political and cultural events of the century puts the portraits in context, but further individual descriptions on the walls are frequently more irritating than helpful. Franz Gertsch's painting of the transvestite artist Luciano Castelli being made-up by his girlfriend Marina is annotated by a stupid little commentary which doesn't tell us who the painting's subjects are, but does state that the painting \"challenges our accepted notions of gender\". What drivel. Not even a 10-year-old would be challenged, though they might well like the painting. </p> <p>This show is a bit of a ragbag. Some of it is laughable, some laudable, some of it irrelevant and some of it really captures a time. In the end, it is just another anthology. But, like the century itself, it had its moments. </p> <p>\u0095 Painting the Century is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2 (0207- 312 2463), until February 4 2001.</p>",
  "Yesterday I conducted my own little experiment. I went into the office toilet, removed my bra, then spent the day without it. <p>For as long as I can remember bras have been a source of discomfort. My earliest bra memories date back to the first year of senior school, when half the girls in class moved with a quiet pride into their trainer bras. Oh, the shame of changing for double PE to reveal a virginal white vest while the rest of them giggled in their little white bras. </p> <p>Eventually I graduated to my own trainer. It was white, with little pink roses, and made me feel very grown-up. It was utterly redundant, but reasonably comfortable - that is, until twanged repeatedly by one's fascinated male peers. </p> <p>Next came the teen bra, with its adjustable straps and vicious little hooks which were forever being undone by classmates, male and female. I began to look wistfully at my drawerful of flat white vests. By then, however, I began to need a bra and there was no turning back. That was it - for the rest of my life, just like the rest of the adult female population. </p> <p>Since then there's been lift and separate, Cross Your Heart, latex, Playtex, lycra and lace; there's been Hello Boys, push up and plunge; the balcony, the Bliss, Affinity, Lovable, and something called Essensis. Strappy, strapless, underwired, wireless, sports bras, day bras - new ones with strings to control your cleavage size and the yoghurty-sounding Bioform with revolutionary plastic inserts instead of underwiring. A \u00a3500 million industry aimed at your chest. </p> <p>Then yesterday I and tens of thousands of other women read a report suggesting that wearing a bra could damage your health. Professor Robert Mansel, of the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, and Simon Cawthorn, consultant surgeon at Bristol's Frenchay Hospital, carried out a six-month trial to see if wearing a bra influenced breast pain. </p> <p>They asked 100 pre-menopausal women to go without a bra for three months then return to wearing one for another three months and record the differences. On average, the number of pain-free days went up by 7% when the women stopped wearing bras. Which seems unsurprising to most bra-wearing females. Bras are at best uncomfortable; at worst they can be instruments of torture. </p> <p>The full findings of the study are to be released in a Channel 4 Dis patches programme called Bras - The Bare Facts, to be broadcast on Thursday, which also investigates claims by medical anthropologist Sydney Singer that breast cancer could be connected with wearing bras. According to Singer's theory, breast cancer is a problem only in cultures where women wear bras. He believes tight bras cause congestion in the lymph nodes, the body's essential defence against the spread of cancer. </p> <p>Cancer charities yesterday moved swiftly to allay women's fears. Professor Gordon McVie, director general of the Cancer Research Campaign, said: \"There is no substantiated evidence to link wearing a bra to breast cancer and I'm very concerned that women will be unnecessarily worried about this suggestion.\" </p> <p>McVie went on: \"The study carried out in Bristol and Cardiff involved just 100 women and only set out to measure breast pain from wearing a bra. It was never intended to show any link between this pain and breast cancer, and no link between the two has ever been satisfactorily proved.\" </p> <p>Likewise one of the authors of the study, Simon Cawthorn, was anxious to stress: \"This study does not link breast pain with breast cancer, and does not show any link between wearing a bra and breast cancer.\" Singer's theory that women in cultures where bras are not worn do not suffer breast cancer is more likely to be because of their diet rather than their underwear, says Cawthorn. </p> <p>But whether bras are subsequently shown to cause breast cancer or not, what emerged among women I spoke to yesterday in the wake of the report is that many of us do not have very happy relationship with our bras, whether we buy them for a tenner with our groceries in Marks &amp; Spencer, or spend \u00a3100 after a two-hour personal fitting in a leading department store. For many of us they are so uncomfortable it would hardly be surprising if they were bad for our health. </p> <p>This is what one woman had to say: \"My whole life I've had one good bra - one bra that was comfortable, that didn't leave enormous scarlet weals on my flesh, that gave me two breasts instead of one; that gave support without stopping me breathing. One good bra! </p> <p>\"It was a sort of blue pebbledash cotton thing from Sock Shop, oddly, and I kept it going for five years. It was disgustingly unattractive, but under clothes my breasts looked like my breasts when I was wearing it. I cried when the much darned strap finally gave in last year and I had to throw it out. Since then I've bought about one bra a week and none of them are comfortable. All of them leave marks.\" </p> <p>Or this from another colleague: \"I went out dancing once, sporting an all-new underwired number and returned home to find huge parts of my chest gouged out by evil, satanic wiring. I think this might be one of the consequences of wearing such items if one is not overly endowed.\" </p> <p>Or this: \"I nagged my mother for a little black satin number for my 18th birthday. I tried to ignore the unarguable truth that it gave me a comedy trapezium-shaped bust and no cleavage to speak of. I felt like an utter fraud all night and suffered nasty red strap-marks on my shoulders where I had winched up the bra in an attempt to gain cleavage. It's really not surprising that I should favour vests now, is it?\" </p> <p>Vests are fine for women with flat chests, but for women with big breast, bras are essential for comfort. One colleague described her Triumph \"Doreen\" as \"life-saving\". And our breasts are getting bigger all the time. When Tony Dixey, group general manager for Playtex, began working in the bra industry 20 years ago 34B was the average size, now it's 36C. </p> <p>\"To us comfort is the most important thing. British women expect comfort when buying a bra, far more than continental women. Now women will buy bras for occasions. Most women have a wardrobe of bras - a strapless bra, a bra for the day time, a glamour bra for night, a sports bra.\" If your bra is not comfortable, you're probably wearing the wrong size and should go for a proper fitting - 70 to 80% of us are wearing the wrong bra apparently. </p> <p>Bras may be bad for your health; they may be good for your figure; they can be a turn-on (black, lacy push-up) or a turn-off (grey, saggy, gone through the wash too many times) but according to Cawthorn they can't keep stop the natural ageing process. Not even if you wear one all night like Marilyn Monroe to keep them perky. \"There's no evidence that wearing a bra will prevent your breasts from drooping and sagging,\" he says. </p> <p>Which brings me back nicely to my own little experiment. It was much, much more comfortable going without. No red marks on the shoulders; no sore, itchy bit at the back where the label sticks and tickles; no constricted breathing or pinched ribs. Very earthy. Very pleasant. But I stayed very, very still, all day. And when I did move, I clutched something to my chest to hide any unprofessional jiggling. Bras - a necessary evil perhaps.</p>",
  "<p>A woman whose leg was amputated after she was wrongly diagnosed with cancer won a \u00a31.2m settlement yesterday following a seven-year legal battle. </p> <p>Vicki Gilbert, 27, of Leeds, underwent three gruelling operations to remove her knee and most of her shinbone after she was diagnosed with a malignant bone tumour in 1992. The shinbone was replaced with a titanium implant. </p> <p>She underwent chemotherapy, but less than a year later doctors at the Royal Orthopaedic hospital in Birmingham told her that the diagnosis was wrong and she did not have cancer. </p> <p>It emerged that she had a harmless bone cyst and most of her surgery and treatment had not been needed. </p> <p>The leg implant caused constant stress fractures and pain, so she had to have her leg amputated above the knee in September 1996. </p> <p>The unnecessary chemotherapy caused permanent damage to her kidneys for which she still takes medication, reduced sensation in her hands and feet and damage to her hearing. </p> <p>Yesterday Birmingham health authority confirmed it had settled her claim. The authority said in a statement: \"The health authority did admit liability some time ago and has not been contesting the case. We are sorry for what has happened and wish her well for the future.\" </p> <p>The saga is just the latest in a series of misdiagnosed cancer cases in which patients with benign conditions have been forced to undergo mutilating operations and harmful chemotherapy. </p> <p>Three weeks ago Jennifer Cormack, who went through more than a dozen operations, including a double mastectomy, after being wrongly diagnosed with breast cancer, won \u00a3345,000 compensation at the high court in London. </p> <p>Ms Gilbert, a college sports lecturer who also works as a disability equality trainer, said she had later learned that a report detailing shortcomings in the pathology service at Birmingham orthopaedic hospital had been leaked to a newspaper seven years before her misdiagnosis. </p> <p>\"I was very angry because they had taken my life away as it was then, all for no reason,\" she said. \"Doctors knew there were inadequacies with the pathology department. </p> <p>\"What has happened to me shouldn't happen in vain and I very much hope the regularity with which these clinical mistakes are occurring is being recognised and that something is done about it.\" </p> <p>She said it was \"particularly frustrating to see that the NHS are not learning from their mistakes\" and producing an effective system to identify errors and staff who consistently make mistakes. </p> <p>Since her leg was amputated four years ago, Ms Gilbert has worn an artificial limb. But she still has to use crutches or a wheelchair some days. </p> <p>Her solicitor, Julia Hurstfield of the Manchester law firm Pannone &amp; Partners, said that while \u00a31.2m was a large sum of money, it was to compensate her not only for the pain and suffering relating to the misdiagnosis but also for the ongoing treatment resulting from the chemotherapy, for the provision of an artificial limb for the rest of her life - a conservative estimate is around \u00a3300,000 - special adaptations to her home, physiotherapy costs and potential loss of earnings. </p> <p>Ms Gilbert, who married a surveyor in 1998, lectures in sport at Barnsley and Harrogate colleges. She is also a National Coaching Foundation tutor. </p> <p><strong>Claims: Hospitals accused</strong></p> <p><strong> Errors in cancer diagnoses</strong> </p> <p>October </p> <p><strong> Jennifer Cormack</strong> , 63, who underwent 14 operations before learning she never </p> <p>had breast cancer, won \u00a3345,000 in the high court. She endured a </p> <p>double mastectomy, seven reconstructive breast </p> <p>procedures, a thyroidectomy and two hernia repairs. She also had a hysterectomy after problems with the cancer drug tamoxifen, and one of her silicone implants burst. </p> <p>June </p> <p><strong> Carenza Lewis</strong> , 37, a member of Channel 4's Time Team, is suing an NHS trust </p> <p>after learning that the removal of both her breasts was unnecessary. </p> <p>She was one of seven patients who suffered \"serious consequences\" when their conditions were misdiagnosed by an elderly locum histologist. </p> <p>January </p> <p><strong> Seamus Kinsella</strong> , 37, was awarded \u00a3112,000 damages in an out-of-court </p> <p>settlement after a hospital removed three quarters of his stomach in the mistaken belief that he had cancer. </p> <p>When he became ill again, soon after the operation, it was discovered that he </p> <p>was suffering from a condition that can be treated with drugs. </p> <p>April 1999 </p> <p><strong> Bryan Atkinson</strong> , 60, a businessman, is suing a hospital after being told he was dying of cancer. For 37 weeks he thought he was terminally ill until a biopsy </p> <p>showed his inoperable tumour was only an inflamed bowel.</p>",
  "The father of murdered toddler James Bulger yesterday vowed to hunt down his son's killers when they are released. <p>After spending more than seven years trying to come to terms with the brutal death of his two-year-old son, Ralph Bulger said: \"Something's got to be done about it. We can't just stop now, and let these two little animals get released ... I will do all I can to try my best to hunt them down.\" </p> <p>Speaking for the first time since the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, announced that the minimum sentence for Robert Thompson and Jon Venables was at an end, meaning they could be eligible for parole within months, Mr Bulger, 34, described his fury at hearing how his son's murderers could be free by next February. </p> <p>The pair, who were 10 when they abducted James Bulger from The Strand shopping centre in Bootle, on Merseyside, in February 1993, have served their sentences in secure local authority accommodation and are now unlikely to be sent to a young offenders institution or adult prison. </p> <p>Mr Bulger, who is divorced from James's mother, Denise, said he was \"absolutely gutted\" with Lord Woolf's decision and that he would appeal against it. \"I couldn't believe it,\" he told GMTV. \"I'm going to go through [the appeal] with my solicitor and do as much as we can.\" </p> <p>He said the years since James's death had been hard and it was something he would never come to terms with. \"The things they did to James ... they even denied an open coffin. We didn't really get to say goodbye to him.\" </p> <p>Mr Bulger's warning to his son's killers contrasted with the comments made at the weekend by James's mother, Denise Fergus, who said she wanted to meet her son's killers in an attempt to answer some of the questions that still haunt her. </p> <p>\"I want to look them in the eye and ask them why? I just want to know what they did it for and how they could be so evil as to do it to a baby? Was it just for fun? I want to ask them before they are released ... if they think about James, about the life that has been taken away.\" </p> <p>It is unlikely Mr Bulger would be able to carry out his threat to hunt down Thompson and Venables because they would be given new identities when they are released. </p> <p>In addition, strict rulings made after their trial in 1993 set out terms for a wide-ranging injunction banning the media from revealing any details about their rehabilitation or printing photos of them taken after a certain date. </p> <p>Last night a spokeswoman for Merseyside police refused to comment on Mr Bulger's remarks. \"The welfare of the two teenagers are the responsibility of their carers and it is not really appropriate for us to discuss comments made on television,\" she said. </p> <p>After it emerged that Mr Bulger would not qualify for legal aid to fund his appeal, a victims' support group, Mothers Against Murder and Aggression (Mama), announced it was planning a celebrity concert in aid of James's family. </p> <p>Dee Warner, of Mama, said: \"You could say you shouldn't take the law into your own hands but if the law worked for the victims rather than the criminals there wouldn't be these vigilante attacks. I couldn't advocate anyone being murdered but I haven't had a child murdered so I am not in a position to say how I would feel.\" </p> <p>Ms Warner appealed for celebrities watching the programme to contact Mama to put their weight behind the concert, which will take place in Liverpool. </p> <p>\"There's a wealth of talent in Liverpool - Jimmy Tarbuck, Lily Savage ... Ricky Tomlinson, we want all those people, that big-hearted city, to come together, give up your time, free of charge.\"</p>",
  "Concern has been raised by the diagnosis of a 74-year-old man with variant CJD that there may be a hidden number of such cases previously diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia (New case highlights BSE fears, October 28). The question is potentially answerable by the use of dementia registers. <p>For many years all cases of dementia identified in Camberwell were systematically followed up to death and a postmortem was carried out whenever possible. Unfortunately, due to the shortsighted view of funding bodies, the register is not as complete as it might have been. However, over a period of some 10 years only one case of CJD was identified at postmortem. This was a younger man with familial CJD, not the new variant. </p> <p>A definitive answer cannot be given at this stage, but it appears that fears of a large number of cases of \"hidden variant CJD\" among patients thought to have other forms of dementia may be exaggerated. It emphasises inter alia the need to fully fund such registers and to carry out a postmortem with detailed examination of the brain in every case if possible.<br><b>Raymond Levy</b><br>Emeritus professor Institute of Psychiatry<br>RLevylond@aol.com </p> <p>You correctly state in a tiny column (CJD facts, October 27) that the cause of CJD is \"not conclusively proven\". However, the remainder of your coverage assumes as incontrovertible fact that BSE is the cause of vCJD. There have been 80 CJD deaths since 1995 - an infinitesimally small number as a proportion of all annual deaths in the UK. Have the numbers of deaths due to CJD increased, decreased or remained relatively stable over the period before and after the discovery of BSE? If there has been an increase, is it statistically significant? </p> <p>Surely we need to question society's propensity to panic about BSE/CJD? We urgently need a serious consideration of the dangers of society's current mistrust of scientific explanation in favour of emotionalism and wild speculation.<br><b>Dr Mark Wanstall</b><br>Leeds<br>mwanstall@hotmail.com </p> <p>Radio 4's Farming Today programme has said the recent mystery disease in farmed salmon in Scotland might be a brain disease and that salmon had been recycled in the feed given to farmed salmon. When will we have a law prohibiting any cannibalistic practice? Surely after BSE, and vCJD we do not need a vCJD(S).<br><b>Alan Mathison</b><br>Harrow<br>alan.mathison@ntlworld.com </p>",
  "<p>The Football Association's executive director David Davies welcomed the likely conclusion of their search for a new coach as a deal with Lazio's Sven-Goran Eriksson became imminent.</p> <p>\"We are very pleased with the progress we have made,\" he said. \"This is a very important decision for supporters and for anyone who cares about English football.</p> <p>\"His proven track record speaks for itself. I don't think anyone disputes that - football people will tell you that. He's won a championship in his home country of Sweden and he's won a championship in Portugal and in Italy. He is well known throughout world football. But let's not jump the gun here. Progress has been made, as we hoped it would be this week, and the talks will continue.</p> <p>\"We have discussed with him the possibility of taking charge of the England team both for key games in the short term and in a full-time capacity in the long term. Those talks will resume in the very near future.\"</p> <p>But Davies, mindful of the fans' anxiety over England's foreign future, stressed the role that will be played by Englishmen should Eriksson's appointment be confirmed.</p> <p>\"I understand his contract runs until the end of this season,\" he said, \"and meanwhile we are continuing to build a team of young English coaches, all with real potential.</p> <p>\"We are building that team to work with the senior England coach and our aim in this difficult process is to get the best available team of coaches to give the England players the greatest chance of success.\"</p> <p>The FA chairman Geoff Thompson welcomed the promised appointment, despite the fact that England would have a foreign manager for the first time.</p> <p>\"We said from the outset that we wanted to get the best possible coach for the England team,\" said Thompson. \"There are not many English people available at the present time, so we have to spread the net a little bit.</p> <p>\"Clearly, the appointment of Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren for the game against Italy is the first step of the process of ensuring there are Englishmen coming through the coaching system.</p> <p>\"But we have to address the issue as it stands. It is not signed and sealed yet and I'm sure I will be the first to know when it is. But I am fully confident in Adam Crozier and the team he has got around him. I am sure they will get the best person available.\" It now looks as if they might already have got him.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
