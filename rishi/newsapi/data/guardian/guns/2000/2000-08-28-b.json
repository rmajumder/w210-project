  "<p> Hands in a hole in a wall grapple as the audience settle themselves. The great Berlin company Schaub\u00fchne am Lehniner Platz are throwing stuff at us even before the performance begins. </p> <p>This company, which for the past 29 years has nurtured some of the great names of German dramatic theatre, has controversially had a change of identity. Last year Sasha Waltz became artistic director - she's young, female, and, what's more, a choreographer. </p> <p>Supremely confident of this transformation, Waltz has chosen to make K\u00f6rper (Bodies) the focus of her debut production with the company. As the lights dim, a group of dancers in dark suits begin a merciless slamming session. It makes you wince: those bones are making a lot of noise. </p> <p>Meanwhile, stage left. A great black 10 metre-high monolith looming over the action suddenly reveals a saintly body flat-framed in a window of light. Another curls into view, and another, until 11 are oozing around together in this celestial elevator, white bodies stark against black. It's nude heaven featuring Lucian Freud's fleshy, soft-folded meat, Breugel's hellish medieval souls, the smooth marble pi\u00e8tas of the renaissance, the bodies of science - all rolling together in slow motion. A whole civilisation's worth of body beautiful crop ping up in one image. Only a wizard like Waltz could collect and dissect ideas with such skill, and only then with a company as individual and experienced as the one she has brought together. </p> <p>For an hour and a half, the company whacks out an encyclopedic list of corporeal facts and fairy tales. The work flashes out myriad images of the body in art, in psychology, in medicine, in sport, in love, in society, in violence, in religion. At times there are bursts of pure, liquid dance, at others performers are grabbing handfuls of skin and carrying each other around. If you are ever lucky enough to see these K\u00f6rper, you might want to pinch yourself at the end and check that you're still there. </p>",
  "One wonders how Jack Nicklaus would explain Tiger Wood's success. In 1994 Nicklaus was asked why so few black people made it in golf. In response he pointed not to colour bars, the sport's socio-economic profile or the expense of taking it up professionally, but to biology. \"They have different muscles that react in different ways,\" he said. Woods presumably inherited the specific sliver of DNA that deals with the swing, drive and putt from his mother's Malaysian side. <p>As a mammoth summer of sport comes to a crescendo with the Olympics, two certainties come with it. The first is that black athletes will shower themselves in glory and medals in the track events. The other is that in the minds and myths of many their success will further establish a relationship between race and sporting prowess. </p> <p>Anecdotally the statistics are compelling. All the men's world running records from the 100 metres to the marathon are held by black people. No white man has ever run 100 metres in under 10 seconds - more than 200 black men have. All the finalists for the men's 100 metres in Sydney will be black. </p> <p>Logic suggests this cannot be reduced to mere coincidence. But the search for an explanation would be laudable if some of the conclusions weren't so laughable. For prime among them is that black people are naturally better at sport. Their success, it is argued, is based not on conditions in the world into which they were born but what they were born into the world with. </p> <p>Black people, they say, have \"less subcutaneous fat on arms and legs\", \"smaller chest cavities\", \"a higher centre of gravity\", \"a longer arm span\", \"faster patellar tendon reflex\", \"greater body density\", higher levels of plasma testosterone\" and a \"higher percentage of fast-twitch muscles\". So there you go. Let us forget for a minute the glaring inconsistencies. The absence of black women from the equation; the history of race-mixing that makes race science a nonsense; that west African athletes, who are presumably of a similar racial make-up to their distant African-American cousins, do not excel at athletics; or that black athletic excellence does not extend to the likes of archery or rowing. Never mind all that. Black athletes do well because it is in their genes. On your marks. Get set. Go. I'll race you to the bell curve. </p> <p>Those who hoped that Joe Louis felled such theories in 1938 when he knocked out the Nazi poster boy Max Schmeling are in for a shock. Racial determinism is back in vogue. Earlier this year the home secretary, Jack Straw, debated with Charles Murray, author of The Bell Curve, which claims that black people have, on average, an IQ 15 points lower than white people. Then came the book by Jon Entine, Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It. Next week the BBC will discuss it in The Faster Race. </p> <p>The very title of Entine's book tells a story. Its passive-agressive tone locates it in the era of the backlash - part of a continuum that stretches from Newt Gingrich's Contract with America to the outbursts of the newly blond and now single Billy on Ally McBeal. This is the voice and the strategy of the Angry, White Male who must first claim victim-hood and then assert bravery in challenging a fictitious \"liberal establishment\" before peddling his prejudices. </p> <p>For claiming that black athletes dominate sports is anything but \"a taboo\". It is a racist orthodoxy that fits hand-in-glove with that other long-established orthodoxy, that black people are stupid. Backing Entine's claim on television will be Professor Philippe Rushton, who believes that black people's brains are smaller than those of other races, leaving them less intelligent but more highly sexed and agressive. Rushton is reported to have paid 150 participants - 50 black, 50 white, 50 Asian - to answer questions on penis size. His conclusion? \"It's a trade-off: more brain or more penis. You can't have everything.\" </p> <p> A trade-off indeed. For if success is genetic, then why not failure too? \"White men can't jump\" is only a hop and a skip away from \"Black men can't think, read, write or behave\". In this field Entine is not a daring pioneer but the butt-end of a lineage stretching back centuries. In 1884 the Encyclopedia Britannica stated: \"No full-blooded negro has ever been distinguished as a man of science, a poet or an artist, and the fundamental equality claimed for him by ignorant philanthropists is belied by the whole history of the race throughout the historic period.\" </p> <p>Black people are not the sole targets of this broadside. When Jews were prominent in American basketball during the 20s and 30s the sports editor of the New York Daily News explained that \"the game places a premium on an alert, scheming mind, flashy trickiness, artful dodging and general smart-aleckness\". </p> <p>But black people are on the frontline. For there are the equally compelling statistics in the schools, jails and dole queues of the west that tell another story. Black people fall foul not simply of the law of the land but the law of probabilities in everything from employment to the criminal justice system. In the words of Jesse Jackson: \"We do well at sport because the playing field is even and the rules are public. But when blacks are kicking up the field and people start making up the rules... that's when the problems start.\" </p> <p>\"What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?\" asked the late Trinidadian intellectual, CLR James. He, more than anyone, understood that sport is not a purely meritocratic endeavour but an integral part of a nation or region's cultural, political and economic makeup. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the Caribbean, where basketball and football are fast overtaking cricket among the young. Two days before the West Indies were humiliated at Headingly, Trinidad and Tobago thrashed Panama at football 6-0. Yesterday's \"natural\" cricketers are today's \"natural\" footballers. The switch is not in their genes but in their society. </p> <p>Moreover, sport is a multi-million pound business for some and a career choice for others. People take the chances that come their way. If discrimination denies them opportunity in one place and offers it to them elsewhere, they will take it. It is not middle-class African-Americans with the chance to become lawyers, doctors and administrators who are rushing to the starting line or the boxing ring but the poor with few other options. </p> <p>Does this deny any connection between the physiology of black athletes and their sporting achievements? Not entirely, although given all the other far more plausible explanations, I doubt the motives of those who are desperate to establish it. Whatever impact race may have on black people's sporting ability is negligible in comparison to the impact that racism has on their daily lives. So feel free to make the case and I will feel free to be insulted. When the stopping, searching, jailing, bailing, executing, excluding, unemploying and underpaying are over - then, and only then, will I listen to talk of \"tendons\", \"arm spans\" and \"plasma\". </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Spike Lee's latest movie is a riot of laughs. It ought to be: it records a stand-up performance by four black comedians whose nationwide act is the most successful comedy tour ever. And the funny thing is, most white Americans have never heard of them. </p> <p>The comics - Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac - have set records in New York's Madison Square Garden and taken Washington DC's MCI Centre by storm. The tour has grossed $37m in two years, but most critics are still scratching their heads, wondering where the four came from. </p> <p>The film, The Original Kings of Comedy, is likely to change all that. \"I wanted to see this [tour] on film because it had to be documented,\" says Lee. \"Being on film would enable a lot more people to see it. This was a cultural event. The people who came out for this saved their money, bought new outfits and really got worked up. It was the most successful comedy tour ever and mainstream America didn't even really know about it.\" </p> <p>The film took $12m in its opening weekend in the US. It is already being compared to black comedy concert classics such as Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip, Martin Lawrence's You So Crazy and Eddie Murphy's Raw. Variety said The Original Kings of Comedy was \"consistently hilarious\" and Lee \"conveys a palpable sense of the rousing, communal energy of the live performance.\" </p> <p>It was filmed over two nights in February at the Charlotte Coliseum in North Carolina, where the tour had kicked off in 1997. Lee used 12 cameras, two of them weaving among the audience. Each comedian does his set in turn. Host Harvey's speciality is satire, his comedy perhaps smarter than the others: he rants against rap music and tells the story of a black sportsman who fled to Nashville to escape the police, \"like they ain't gonna find your black ass there\". Hughley, with his wry, scathing wit, verbally beats up the audience and attacks bad jobs, bad bosses and grandparents who take Viagra. Cedric is the lovable, mischievous, rotund one who sings, dances, juggles his gags and does hilarious impressions of golf-playing black people trying to make like Tiger Woods. And Mac, with his bug-eyes and raspy voice, is all in your face, raw and hardcore, making jokes about beating the kids. </p> <p>So why have these comedians suddenly made it? The key words are \"relatively unknown\". Harvey, for instance, is not a household name in the US. But his self-titled sitcom is starting its fifth season on the WB network and is one of the most popular TV shows in black households; he also hosts a Showtime at the Apollo TV series. Mac has appeared in numerous movies including Life, Friday, and Spike Lee's Get On the Bus. Cedric the Entertainer hosted Black Entertainment Television's stand-up show, Comic View, in 1994, the year he won the channel's Richard Pryor comic of the year award. Hughley has his own self-titled sitcom, The Hughleys, based on his experience of moving from the 'hood to the 'burbs, and like Cedric the Entertainer has been tearing up the black comedy circuit for years. </p> <p>So although the four were not big mainstream names, they had high profiles among their target audience. The established pattern is to build a following on the circuit, secure a sitcom which increases your profile, then go for the big one - Hollywood maybe - where your hard-won audience will ensure the black dollars come flooding in. It is a tradition of black American comedy, begun by Richard Pryor in the 70s and followed by Eddie Murphy in the 80s, Chris Rock in the 90s, and Martin Lawrence and Chris Tucker now. </p> <p> The volatile chemistry of their very distinctive styles also lies behind the Kings' success. What they all share, in Variety's words, is \"rapid-fire delivery and a take-no-prisoners attitude\". Their material covers being poor, the workplace, dysfunctional families, child-rearing, growing old disgracefully, sex, church and parents, all discussed with foulmouthed glee. </p> <p>It is all a far cry from the schoolteachers and responsible fathers they play in their sitcoms (and the Kings, aged from mid-30s to early 40s, are all family men themselves). Perhaps this is why the show has an old-school flavour; Curtis Mayfield and James Brown are the kind of background grooves they perform to. </p> <p>At 29, the tour's promoter Walter Latham is almost from a different generation. He spent his youth listening to Richard Pryor records, borrowed $4,000 from his mother and promoted his first show, a rap concert, in 1992. In 1997 he formed the Kings. He promoted the tour on black radio stations, eschewing mainstream TV and press attention. His dream is to bring together the Kings with Martin Lawrence, Tucker and Rock. But for now he is content that his company, Latham Entertainment, co-produced the film of the concert with MTV Films and Lee's Forty Acres and a Mule Filmworks. The budget for the digital production now seems a snip at $3m. </p> <p>Burt Laurent, a British comedy tour promoter and director of the Black International Comedy Awards, has been following the tour closely. It shows that \"the black pound has a high value and there should be more product geared towards that audience,\" he says. \"It's proof that black comedy is worth a phenomenal amount of money.\" Could it work here? \"Obviously it wouldn't be on the same scale but I believe it could and I'm in the process of putting it together. I'm talking to Felix Dexter, Curtis Walker, Gina Yashere, Roy Diamond and Angie Le Mar about doing something.\" </p> <p>More deals are under way for the performers on the back of Lee's film. Lorne Michaels, creator and executive producer of Saturday Night Live, is developing a variety show for them. Bernie Mac has been offered a sitcom deal by Columbia/ Tri Star Television which will be directed by Ted Demme. Hughley is releasing a comedy album this year. When the tour restarts in October Latham is going to add the all-female Queens of Comedy. It will no doubt please the women who are the Kings' biggest fans. </p> <p>Lee's film has been praised for capturing the unique flavour of the tour. Black comedy nights are always filled with uninvited and spontaneous audience participation. Black audiences will always call and respond and give the Kings as good as they get. Right now that audience is calling with its money. But it's not waiting for a response from white America.</p>",
  "<p>The current phase of American capitalism began on November 9 1989, with the formal collapse of socialism. Since then, a lot of new technology has arrived to enhance market forces. The internet is one such technology. In a few short years, it has pretty much gutted the principles of corporate socialism - jobs for life; employee and customer loyalty; all for one and one for all - and replaced them with Lord knows what. </p> <p>Any time line that describes this phase of American capitalism would also have to include April 4 1994 (birth of Netscape), November 10 1994 (birth of Amazon.com), May 5 1996 (birth of eBay) - and August 4 1997. August 4 1997 was the beginning of the end of another socialistic force in American life: the mass market. Forty years from now, when your grandson asks you, \"Grandma, how did 50m Americans ever let themselves be talked into buying the same mouthwash?\" you will say, \"Well, you have to know how things were before August 4 1997.\" </p> <p>This was the day a pair of Silicon Valley engineers named Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay started their own technology company with several million dollars from a pair of venture capital firms. Barton and Ramsay's first idea was to turn the American home into a network, but, after a few months, they went back to their venture capitalists and told them that home networking was a bad idea because they couldn't explain it to anyone but other geeks. They had another idea, though. Instead of transforming the entire American home, they decided to focus on the television. </p> <p>Barton had become obsessed with the television a few years earlier, when working at Silicon Graphics. He helped to build the only interactive television that actually worked, installed in late 1994 by Time Warner in 4,000 homes in Orlando, Florida, and then watched in dismay as his beloved project was overrun by the internet. The internet did a fraction of what the new TVs promised, but at a fraction of the price. </p> <p>Like many smart engineers, Bar ton is a man used to figuring things out. The TV gnawed at him because he didn't have the answer. The box worked. And yet no one cared. There were several lessons in this: </p> <p><strong> No 1 </strong> Brilliant gadgets for a mass market do not go anywhere if the masses cannot afford them. </p> <p><strong> No 2</strong> A big company is not necessarily the best place to create a revolutionary technology. </p> <p><strong> No 3</strong> The whims of the American consumer are the eighth wonder of the world. They can wreak havoc with the most powerful establishments. </p> <p>When Barton and Ramsay returned to the television, they devised another black box, one with a memory. Far simpler to programme than a VCR, it was also considerably more versatile. The viewer could record programming. Or he could simply tell the box to go out and find him the kind of programmes he liked. If he liked indiscreet women, he could record and store every episode of Sex and the City. If he liked intelligent blood and guts, he didn't need to wait until TNT's Clint Eastwood week - he could just instruct his box to fetch Clint Eastwood movies as they played. The viewer's only constraint on choice was that the programme had to be broadcast by someone, sometime. </p> <p>The black box also enabled the viewer to treat all television - even live television - as television he had recorded for his own private use. All he would need to do is start watching a programme a few minutes after it began. Then, by pressing a button, he could skip the credits, the time-outs, the weather and all the other boring stretches of television designed by producers to lull viewers into watching ads. He could also skip the ads. </p> <p>Over time, the viewer would create his own private TV channel, stored on a hard drive in the black box, tailored with great precision to his interests. When someone asked Barton or Ramsay, \"Tell me again what this gadget does?\" they now had a simple answer: \"It lets you watch anything you want to watch when you want to watch it.\" </p> <p>There was one other cool thing the box could do. While the viewer watched the television, the box would watch the viewer. The viewer's every decision would be stored in a kind of private museum of whims. Over time, the box would come to know what the viewer liked - maybe even better than the viewer himself. All by itself, it would record shows it calculated the viewer might like. The box was more than a box, it was a butler, and the more it learned about its master's whims, the more it would be able to fetch what its master wanted. </p> <p>Calling their company TiVo, Ramsay, 50, the chief executive officer, and Barton, 42, the chief technology officer, knew the box was not where the money was - the box was, in fact, a big money loser. To kick-start the market they would need to pay an electronics company to make the boxes and sell them below cost. The trick was to get as many into American homes as possible. TiVo's programming software would arrive in millions of homes either with existing cable boxes or, in the future, embedded in new TV sets, cable boxes or satellite receivers. The long-term goal was to become unnecessary. \"We'll know we've succeeded when the TiVo box vanishes,\" Barton says. </p> <p>The ambition of the enterprise was breathtaking. The company intended to plop itself down between the 102m TV homes and the $50bn TV industry. Once the box was in place, TiVo would be the hub of the TV industry. The company would know the subtle preferences of every viewer. It could then charge a fee to anyone who wanted to locate groups of viewers: networks, cable companies, advertisers. The trick was to get the box into those 102m homes - and that would cost money. Lots of money. Ramsay told the venture capitalists they needed to lose $300-400m before they became profitable. Prior to the internet boom, capitalists were chary about sinking one-tenth of that sum into a small, risky venture; now, says Ramsey,\"instead of saying, 'No,' they said, 'Great.' \" </p> <p>What made this enthusiasm even more astonishing was that a rival company had already sprung up. Anthony Wood, a young computer game entrepreneur, stumbled on the same idea at roughly the same time. Wood had been frustrated by his VCR's failure to record episodes of his favourite show, Star Trek. In early 1998, not long after Barton and Ramsay got their first financing, Wood generously agreed to accept $8m from venture capitalists. He called his new company Replay Networks (later Replay TV). </p> <p>By March 1999, the first TiVo and Replay boxes had already been shipped. By June this year, the companies had sold about 100,000 boxes between them, largely without advertising. Several market analysts estimate that they will have sold 5-7m boxes by the end of 2002 - and that, within a decade, they will be in 90m homes. There's room for them to coexist happily. They're seizing control of a $50bn industry from its creators; there's more than enough booty to go around. Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, who invested his own money in Replay, calls it \"the Trojan horse for the computer industry\", offering it the opportunity \"to gain control of the entertainment industry.\" </p> <p>The new companies threaten to do politely to the TV industry what Napster did to the music industry: help consumers to help themselves to entertainment without \"paying\" the networks and advertisers. Naturally, this disturbs the networks and advertisers. </p> <p>\"The one question our investors did ask us,\" Ramsay says, \"is, 'How long will it take for the TV networks to hate you so much that they shut you down?' \" Talk to people at TiVo and Replay, and in the networks and ad firms, and you realise there is an official story and a true story. The official story, believed by practically no one, is that these boxes won't destroy the TV industry as we know it; they'll merely enable its current rulers to make it an even better place. </p> <p>To persuade the networks of this pleasant notion, TiVo had to play down a lot of what made their box desirable to a consumer. Instead of a button for skipping commercials, for instance, Barton designed a fast-forward button with three speeds, enabling the TiVo user to speed through the ads but not skip them entirely. Replay TV at first viewed the networks' interests as irrelevant: its remote control has a \"QuickSkip\" button, which lets the viewer leap ahead in increments of 30 seconds, the length of a typical TV commercial. </p> <p>But when Kim LeMasters, formerly of CBS, replaced Wood as Replay's CEO, he struck a much more conciliatory note. Though he wasn't able to scrap QuickSkip, he said he would not promote the feature. So both the companies now argue to the networks that a device that steals their power and hands it to consumers is actually good for them. </p> <p>They make two points. The first is that several new accessories that promised a revolution have already appeared - the VCR, the remote control, cable TV - only to be assimilated without greatly disrupting the existing social order. The other point is that the box encourages people to watch even more television. This prospect may cast doubt on the future of intelligent life, but it should, in theory, be good for TV networks. Replay now has data proving that its new customers watch, on average, three hours more television each week. </p> <p>That's the official story. But it becomes less plausible every day, thanks to the information piling up inside TiVo and Replay about how ordinary people use their boxes. They use them to undermine, with ruthless precision, the interests of TV networks and mass-market advertisers. They have two distinctly unsettling new habits. The first is that they don't watch scheduled TV any more. According to Josh Bernoff, a TV industry analyst with Forrester Research, viewers \"get into the habit of not paying attention to when the programmes are on and just watch what they've recorded\". </p> <p>Well. If it doesn't matter when programmes run, then the whole concept of prime time - and its special market value - vanishes. Ditto the idea of pitting one show against another by virtue of its time slot. In the age of black boxes, every show ever broadcast competes against every other show for the viewer's attention; for this reason, whatever advantage a network has in the development of new TV shows disappears. </p> <p>But that isn't the worst news that TiVo and Replay have for the networks. The worst news is that no one watches commercials anymore. Eighty-eight per cent - 88%! - of the ads in the programmes seen by viewers on their black boxes went unwatched. If no one watches commercials, then there is no commercial television. </p> <p>And yet - and here is the punch line - the networks have done nothing but encourage the new technology. By the end of 1999, all three major US television networks, along with most major Hollywood studios, the two biggest Hollywood talent agencies (ICM and CAA) and all the major cable and satellite TV companies, had either made investments in or formed partnerships with both Replay and TiVo. </p> <p>\"A lot of these guys had their bell rung four years ago by the internet,\" says Steve Shannon of Replay, \"and they don't want to be humiliated a second time.\" The internet gave birth to a new corporate religion to replace the one it killed. The religion says: change is inevitable. The question now being posed by the TV establishment - and it emerges from the belly of the beast as a weak burp rather than a loud blast - is no longer \"Will this gadget eventually change how Americans watch TV?\" but \"When this gadget changes how Americans watch television, what else will it change?\" </p> <p>A lot. </p> <p>The black box means the end of commercial television as we know it. It poses two questions that demand a response from the TV industry. The first is: how do you get people to watch ads when, with a button, they can eliminate them? The sad truth about ads is that people really didn't ask to see them; people are just too lazy to avoid them. The box puts an end to that racket. Either the ads will need to become as entertaining as the programmes or the programmes will need to contain the ads, so that they cannot be stripped out. If Jennifer Aniston wants to remain a Friend, she may need to don a T-shirt that says \"Diet Coke\". </p> <p>Television advertising is currently based on data measuring how many households tune in to a programme, not how many watch the ads. But the TiVo and Replay boxes accumulate, in atomic detail, a record of who watched what and when they watched it. Put the box in all 102m homes, and you get a pointillist portrait of the entire US TV audience. And that raises the second and more disturbing question for the TV industry: what do you do when you actually know who is watching and why? </p> <p>Already, TiVo and Replay know what each of their users does every second. And they will know, in great detail, the viewer's interests. An audience of 200,000 people you know intimately might be as valuable as an amorphous mass of 20m. After all, a person with a deep interest in a subject is more likely to watch an ad about that subject. \"You and I may not care to watch a commercial for Preparation H,\" Josh Bernoff says. \"But for someone with haemorrhoids, it might be the thing he is most eager to hear about. And he's the one the makers of Preparation H want to talk to.\" </p> <p>\"This technology will encourage all sorts of niche brands,\" says Barton, \"as well as whole new markets.\" His favourite example is the hockey channel. Everyone interested in it can punch \"hockey\" into their box, and it will find and record any hockey programme. At the moment, there isn't much hockey on the tube; that will change. The maker of the new hockey shows will rent cheap time - at, say, 4am - to broadcast. Hockey enthusiasts will simply record the shows. And, voil\u00e0, a new business is born. \"The business is two guys,\" Barton says. \"One acquires hockey content. The other calls people who make hockey equipment.\" </p> <p>The same slice-'em-and-dice-'em logic applies even to such seemingly mass market events as the Super Bowl. Once the box is ubiquitous, an advertiser need not buy the whole audience; he can buy a piece of the audience. General Motors may still buy time during the Super Bowl, but the company will probably use the time differently. GM might use its 30 seconds to distribute 50 different commercials to 50 different clusters of consumers. Soccer moms will see ads for people movers, middle-aged people will see ads for sports cars, and so on. </p> <p>But even that is a retrograde example. The operative unit in TV ratings will no longer be the programme but the moment. Advertisers and networks will know with weird accuracy who and what within each programme best holds viewers' attention. The box can determine which joke in Letterman's monologue prompted viewers to switch to Leno or which medical emergency inspired viewers to exit ER. (If you thought the pressure on entertainers to be perpetually entertaining couldn't increase, think again.) </p> <p>Many things will change when television is able to whisper finely tuned messages to like-minded consumers rather than hollering crude messages at millions. The hollerers - such as GM and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the two largest buyers of US airtime - are in trouble, for a start. The TV is the mass market. Without the TV, there never would have been Daz or Rice Krispies, but a thousand versions of Daz and Rice Krispies. For the big brands, life without TV is no life at all. </p> <p>Giant corporations whose sole purpose is to mass-market consumer goods exist in their current form because television shaped the mass market. If television ceases to be a mass market, the mass market largely ceases to exist. The question isn't just, \"How does P&amp;G sell soap powder now?\" but \"How does it survive?\" It must transform itself from a maker of mass-market goods into the world's largest boutique. After all, the consumer would obviously prefer that not only the message be precisely tailored but the products as well. In this new market, there will either be hundreds of versions of Daz or no Daz at all. </p> <p>But why stop there? It isn't just the mass market that is crude and inefficient and therefore ripe for re-evaluation; it is Market Man himself. Instead of grouping the consumer by observable traits over which he has little or no control - age, race, gender - the new market will know him by his decisions about how to spend his time, every moment of which is recorded by his box. Getting inside a consumer's mind so as to get inside his wallet, TiVo or Replay will be able to present some mass-market company trying desperately to stay alive with 40,000 consumers classified as People Who Live for Onions. </p> <p>Nick Donatiello of market-research company Odyssey says that the box - along with the internet - makes it likely that ads will be tailored not to outward characteristics but to consumers' more fundamental attitudes. GM will run one commercial, perhaps, for people with a tragic view of life and another for people with a comic view of life. \"In the 50s, you could tell a lot of things about a person if you knew where he lived,\" says Donatiello. \"You can't do that any more. We've become too fragmented and autonomous a society.\" </p> <p>The mass market put a price not on individual states of mind but on the average state of mind of commercially very different people. It did this because it made no economic sense to parse in microscopic detail what every one of us did with our attention and why we did it. And so the market just lumped us together and assumed we all paid more or less the same attention. </p> <p>Now, suddenly, the technology has appeared that can unravel the collective. Maybe the best way to see what is about to happen is to observe what has happened already. To some extent, ads have become more like entertainment, and TV programming has moved in the direction in which it is about to be shoved much, much further. </p> <p>The few events that really benefit from being watched live - sports and awards and sensational unfolding news - have a greater gravitational pull, and a greater market value, than ever. Synthetic events like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Big Brother and Survivor are prescient, for they involve the viewer as a quasi-participant and require the actual participants to deploy many vendable goods, thereby offering sparkling opportunities for product placement. In a \"real\" world, real goods are more naturally introduced than in a purely fictional one. </p> <p>The new black box is really just a fantastically powerful accelerator of the fragmentation of markets caused by non-terrestrial TV and the internet. Already there's some rumbling in the netherworld of advertising and marketing that suggests it is preparing itself for the coming earthquake. Starcom now classifies TV audiences not by demographics but by something it calls \"passion groups\"; P&amp;G's website Reflect.com enables shoppers to create their own beauty products - a harbinger of an age in which every consumer will demand products tailored to him alone. The theme of all this is that groups are narrower and defined by interests and that the ultimate interest is... Me! The main thing about Me! is that he always gets what he wants, or at any rate what he thinks he wants. </p> <p>Nick Donatiello argues that the box is ideally suited for American life as it is currently configured, when consumer choice has been exalted to a fetish. \"If you had offered Americans this box 30 years ago,\" he says, \"they wouldn't have had the same reaction. One reason for watching TV in the 1950s and 60s was the shared experience. The metaphor for the country was the melting pot: people wanted to be the same. People read Time and Newsweek then mainly because other people read Time and Newsweek. Now the metaphor is the quilt.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Michael Lewis is the author of Liar's Poker and The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story. A longer version of this article appeared in the New York Times</p> <p><strong> Meanwhile . . . in Britain</strong><br> </p> <p>It is just two months before the UK gets its first taste of a personal TV service, writes Amy Vickers. Making the first move in this market is TiVo, which has the first-mover advantage and effectively guaranteed its success by signing a two-year exclusive 50/50 deal with Sky. Competitor Replay TV is remaining tight-lipped about any plans to come to Europe, although it has been rumoured to be in discussions with all the terrestrial broadcasters. Unless it enters the market within the next six months, however, it is widely believed that it will have lost too much ground to TiVo to be able to make any headway in the UK. </p> <p>It is hard to see how Sky can lose, because the biggest threat to TiVo is software company NDS - the News Corp company which developed Sky Sports Active and is widely tipped to be the supplier of personal video recorder (PVR) software to Sky's next-generation set-top box. The deal would mean that NDS's digital PVR software, XTV, would be incorporated into set-top boxes early next year and offered to all Sky subscribers for an additional monthly subscription. </p> <p>The Sky-TiVo boxes (minus the Sky branding) are to go on sale in October and will be distributed both through Sky call centres and high-street outlets such as Dixons stores and Granada's Box Clever. It is thought that the TiVo boxes will initially cost around \u00a3399 to buy, with a \u00a310 monthly subscription. </p> <p>Sky is currently signing up broadcasting partners to rent space on the \"showcases\" section of the electronic programme guide (EPG), where they can promote programmes or new channels. This additional service is initially being offered free of charge to all UK channels, with the condition that as the subscriber base grows this will be changed to a subscription/rental model. The BBC was the first broadcaster, apart from Sky, to sign a two-year deal for this service, although other channels are expected to be signed up before launch.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Garnett, the godfather of British television drama, has a knack for producing work that taps into the spirit of the times. From the ground-breaking 1960s social realism of Cathy Come Home to This Life, with its cast of mid-1990s twentysomethings more into partying than politics, Garnett has been closely associated with era-defining drama. </p> <p>Now, just as viewers are coming to terms with how traditional TV can be enhanced by the internet, Garnett's company, World Productions, is putting the finishing touches to a new BBC2 drama with a website designed to play an integral part in an interactive viewing experience. Attachments, which is due to debut on BBC 2 next month, is - appropriately enough - set in a fictional dot.com start-up. The accompanying website will carry content that changes and develops to mirror events in the 10-part TV series. </p> <p>The controller of BBC2, Jane Root, says that when she and Garnett began discussing a follow-up to his previous series, The Cops, he had in mind from the outset a TV drama about people working in an internet-related environment, with a significant interactive element. (Garnett maintained his customary reticence and was not available to discuss the new show.) </p> <p>\"To have Tony, one of the major TV drama figures of our generation, working on this is quite a coming-of-age moment,\" Root declares. \"There's something in common with what happened when the first lightweight 16mm cameras came out and location filming became easier. It provides the chance to create a different visual language.\" </p> <p>Attachments centres on the efforts of Mike and his wife Luce to transform his new music website, seethru.co.uk, from a bedroom hobby into a viable internet content business offering news, reviews and gossip. Frazzled dot.com executives will recognise the couple's struggle to secure venture capital funding without having to give away too much control of their fledgling company. </p> <p>Those lower down the new economy food chain will be able to identify with an internet start-up office divided along content writer versus techie versus programmer versus designer social faultlines. They will also recognise the long periods idled away playing computer games and emailing mates, punctuated by short bursts of frenzied, work-through-the-night activity as deadlines loom. </p> <p>Root is keen to emphasise that the programme has a universal focus on people and relationships in the modern workplace and is not an obscure tale about webheads. She quotes recent research suggesting that the office is now the place where most people meet their life partner. There is also a sense of Attachments being the older sibling of This Life, with central characters moving beyond the mad-for-it hedonism of their early 20s and making serious decisions about their lives and careers. </p> <p>Fans of Garnett's recent BBC2 work, such as This Life and The Cops, will spot plenty of familiar touches. The young and largely unknown cast, for starters. Attachments dispenses with the handheld documentary style of The Cops, but is fast-paced and has similarly been shot using a single camera. There is also an attention-grabbing opening scene, with sex and full-frontal male nudity. On a skateboard. </p> <p>However, providing an interactive element is a completely new departure for Garnett. He has brought together an in-house web production team, led by technical advisers Paul Lakin and David McCandless, which is working closely with the Attachments TV programme-makers at World. Root says that the idea is for the website to feel as though it has been created by the fictional characters from the drama. </p> <p>Seethru.co.uk is being built to operate as a stand-alone content website, with all the features anyone who comes across it while surfing the net and has never seen the TV show would expect. But Attachments fans will be able to visit the site and look at articles that feature in the unfolding TV drama, in many cases getting to read something that is only mentioned or seen in passing. They can email characters from the drama and listen to the music of real unsigned artists through seethru.co.uk. </p> <p>The fictional seethru office is also fitted with webcams, allowing viewers to have another look at footage from the show as well as extra material not seen on TV. Net users will be able to check out footage relating to the cliffhanger ending to the first episode, for instance, which takes place in the office toilet. </p> <p>The seethru site will go live when the first episode goes out, with the standards waxing and waning after that according to the fortunes of the fictional web business. So at the outset users will log on to the amateurish site that Mike has been running from his bedroom. The internet offering will get a more professional feel when funding is secured in the drama, but the quality will also deteriorate again at times of crisis during the series. </p> <p>Root stresses that Attachments is intended to work as a stand-alone TV show, with the viewing audience still the primary focus. But it has also been created to appeal to \"v-users\" - people who experience the drama through their PC screens. Anything that provokes rows or controversy in the drama will disappear from the seethru site at the exact same moment as it is fictionally deleted, according to Root. </p> <p>\"There will be lots of people watching and arguing about things - stuff that's on the webcams, that people have written - who can go and see it on the internet after the show,\" she says. \"I hope people who contact the site will be able to have a role on it.\" </p> <p>Attachments was commissioned last year, before the internet start-up boom - and the headline-grabbing trend for making people overnight dot.com millionaires - reached its surreal, get-rich-quick peak and turned into a crash. </p> <p>But Root is still confident that Garnett has not for once missed the boat. She has already commissioned a second 10-part run of Attachments. </p> <p>\"I rather like the fact that it all started to go wrong. It's more dramatic,\" she says. \"If people were still effortlessly becoming internet millionaires, there would be less dramatic potential. There is now more awareness of the pressures and the possibility of failure - that's more potent.\" </p> <p> <strong>Recognise anybody from your new media office?</strong></p> <p><strong> Mike (Justin Pierre):</strong> seethru.co.uk founder.

  "<p>America's old media establishment has lately faced a barrage of assaults from new media whippersnappers seeking to undermine everything it stands for. So far it has managed to hold the upstarts at bay, if only temporarily. </p> <p>After the music industry's brush with Napster, Hollywood, too, breathed a little easier this month when a US district judge barred Eric Corley, publisher of underground hackers' magazine and website 2600, from posting software code that unlocks scrambling on DVD players, enabling movies to be copied and swapped over the internet. </p> <p>But now it is the turn of the US news fraternity to face the nimbler, techno-savvy start-ups, and the battleground has shifted to mobile phones. </p> <p>Grandees of the news establishment including the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today and CNN have filed a federal suit against a Tel Aviv-based start-up called GoSMS.com, alleging copyright infringement, false advertising and unfairly competing against the publishers' own internet sites. </p> <p>They are suing GoSMS.com for an undisclosed sum, for taking news from their websites, then reformatting and transmitting it to Pacific Bell mobile phone users in California, from its San Diego-based website. The content has been made available to GSM (Global System for Mobiles) enabled phones.</p> <p>According to the suit, filed in New York, GoSMS.com engaged in \"the wholesale, unauthorised copying\" of original, copyrighted articles created by the plaintiffs and originally published at their respective websites. Bruce Keller, attorney for the old media fraternity at Debevoise and Plimpton, believes this is the first copyright infringement case to be brought in the mobile internet arena. </p> <p>\"You cannot copy the content of other people's websites. They are guilty as the day is long under US law,\" he says. In an extraordinary show of brazenness, GoSMS.com claims it is \"justified to take information for limited-display devices, considering the limitations.\"</p> <p>Efraim Rennert, chairman of GoSMS, says he wants the case dismissed on the grounds that the company does not provide a service, but a technology that enables users to read internet content in any form they choose, \"be it on PCs, PDAs, pagers or mobile phones.\" Rennert likens GoSMS.com to an ISP, supplying web access to alternative platforms. </p> <p>\"We are retrieving it without copying anything. The content is always dynamic, and we are essentially providing a browser and the ability to personalise and customise information from a website. We are not using the content.\"</p> <p>The company's aim is to license and sell its reformatting technology to cellular phone operators and ISPs, having successfully sold it just last week to Mobile Solutions AG, a Swiss mobile phone operator. It does not see any need to seek permission from the owners of any content. The implication is that the need for permission lies elsewhere. No doubt this will also have to be tested in court in the near future. </p> <p>The case, to be heard in November, highlights tensions both between old and new media players, and between the US and Europe. With this in mind, GoSMS.com has sites in Dusseldorf and Tel Aviv, and intends to make the same service available in Europe and the far east, as well as across the US. </p> <p>The outcome is important to content owners, start-ups, venture capitalists and players in the intellectual property business on both sides of the Atlantic, as it could determine two things: whether content will continue to be provided free on the internet by the old media players, and how the intrinsic value of new media start-ups will be worked out in future. </p> <p>As part of its defence, GoSMS.com insists it has \"fair use\" of the content, as it is not making a profit from it. \"Fair use\" refers to the doctrine in international law that permits limited copying for non-profit reasons and personal use if it does not devalue the original works. As Paul Stevens, intellectual property partner at internet law firm Olswang, points out \"This case will make people more wary and could be a pointer to what might happen over here.\" He thinks the question of devaluing the original work is central to the case. </p> <p>\"The media companies' main grievance will be that GoSMS.com is piggybacking on their existing service and utilising their goodwill. There is also the implication of some agreement between the two parties and authorisation to use their content, where there is none.\" </p> <p>Kim Nicholson, head of the e-commerce team at Olswang, suggests that such an implied alliance could affect the level of venture capitalists' interest in new media companies. </p> <p>\"If they lose this case, it goes to the heart of the valuation of their business. Some VCs make assessments of assets that include strategic agreements. If these strategic relationships are only implied, leaving the start-up open to trademark infringement, then they will lose interest in such companies.\" </p> <p>As it stands now, GoSMS.com elicits little sympathy from the industry - old or new. \"Some internet businesses seem to have based their model around exploiting material created and paid for by other people,\" says Dominic Young, intellectual property director at News International. </p> <p>\"As a general principle, I don't think that is defensible or desirable. The owners of content and brands should be able to control the way in which these assets are used: the law has acknowledged this principle for years - which is why we have copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws.\" </p> <p>Caroline Sawyer, business development director at online content aggregator moreover.com, says: \"There is a way of doing this and a way of not doing it. All the WAP/SMS issues are very much up in the air at the moment - that's why you have got to show sensitivity and be as open as possible.\" </p> <p>Whatever the outcome, there has been evidence that technology will continue to collide with established media practice and the laws that protect it. With every facet of media now under assault - the video games industry is being shaken up as right now by a month-old start-up called Swapoo, doing to Sega and Nintendo what Napster did to Sony Music and BMG - technology companies will continually chip away until the industry either bends to their will or meets them halfway, accepting that things have to change. </p> <p>GoSMS.com is providing the ability for users to consume web content in the way they want to, whether old media companies are ready or not. Of the plaintiffs, only CNN has a mobile phone news service at present. \"In cases like this, it is usually in the interests of both parties not to bring it court,\" suggests Stevens at Olswang. </p> <p>\"If the content providers lose, they will have problems preventing widespread dissemination. If the start-up loses, then its whole business model fails.\"</p>",
  "Russian firefighters were today struggling to extinguish an inferno that gutted Moscow's giant television tower as officials said there was little chance of saving up to four people feared trapped in a lift. <p>Brown plumes of smoke billowed from the 1,771ft Ostankino Tower, spreading out across northern Moscow as people watched from surrounding streets. But the smoke had disappeared by mid-afternoon and Vyacheslav Mulishkin, first deputy director of the Russian Fire Service, said his crews had finally brought the blaze under control. </p> <p>Temporary firewalls of asbestos placed 231ft up the tower had stopped the fire spreading. But bundles of steel support cables running up its middle had been damaged, possibly threatening the structure. \"The cables are weakened, but have not broken,\" Mr Mulishkin said. </p> <p>Automatic firefighting systems within the tower appeared to have failed or run out of fire-suppressing foam, officials said. </p> <p>Firefighters wearing heavy rubber coats and breathing aids, had to climb hundreds of stairs with heavy metal fire extinguishers and other equipment. </p> <p>Mr Mulishkin said that two civilians and a firefighter were trapped in a lift high in the tower. The lift was too high for rescuers to reach and the people inside may have been overcome by smoke. </p> <p>The fire, which broke out high on the tower's upper spire yesterday afternoon, cut broadcasts for most major television stations in Moscow, though channels were still able to transmit nationally. </p> <p>The tower is the world's second-tallest freestanding structure. </p> <p>More than 300 firefighters and other emergency workers were called in. A helicopter circled close to the tower, apparently checking for damage. </p> <p>\"This emergency highlights what condition vital facilities, as well as the entire nation, are in,\" President Vladimir Putin told a cabinet meeting. \"Only economic development will allow us to avoid such calamities in the future.\" </p> <p>It was the latest in a series of disasters, including gas explosions, industrial accidents and breakdowns in the power grid, which have underscored the weakened state of Russia's infrastructure due to lack of money and poor maintenance. </p> <p>It also follows the Kursk nuclear submarine catastrophe in which 118 sailors died when it sank in the Barents Sea during a military exercise. </p> <p>Responding to fears that the tower could collapse, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said \"a large danger arises from the physical condition of the concrete parts of the tower.\" </p> <p>A Moscow city surveyor on the scene, Vladimir Aleksin, said the tower's upper spire had tilted slightly. Its tip was off-centre by about two metres. </p> <p>The fire started after a short-circuit in wiring belonging to a paging company. Visitors were quickly evacuated from the restaurant and observation deck, which were engulfed several hours later as the fire descended. </p> <p>The interior minister Vladimir Rushailo said authorities considered it unlikely that arson was the cause. Prosecutors were today investigating whether criminal negligence was responsible for the fire. </p> <p>Media minister Mikhail Lesin said it would take two or three days to restore television broadcasts to Moscow, while months would be needed to renovate the tower completely. </p> <p>The Ostankino tower was erected in 1967. It surpassed New York's Empire State Building as the world's tallest structure when it was built, and held the title until 1975 when it was surpassed by the CN tower in Toronto.</p>",

Mr Salmon dashed for his camera after the bird perched on a barn roof opposite the association's regional office at Kinnerton, Presteigne. </p> <p>\"I have heard of several sightings of this rather fearsome bird of prey in the Welsh countryside,\" said Mr Davies. \"It seems that this bird is seen all over the world and has a tendency to appear wherever an industry is in serious financial difficulties.

  "Quicksilver Reef Cruises' state-of-the-art catamaran speeds out from Queensland's virgin rainforests to a small floating platform anchored on the outer reaches of the Great Barrier Reef, 30 miles off the coast of Australia. <p>Every day, 300 tourists take the boat, savouring this unique meeting of two world heritage areas. Every evening, as the catamaran returns to shore, it deposits their shit and shower water in the shipping channel between the rainforest and reef. </p> <p>Australia prides itself on its eco-tourism. It has 13 designated world heritage areas, constituting 10% of the natural areas in the world defined by Unesco as protected places of universal significance. </p> <p>The marine park authority and the wet tropics management authority are the chief conservation bodies charged with preserving the reef and the rainforest. They seek not to ban people from such stunning scenery, but promote its \"wise use\". </p> <p>Tourism is seen as one use. It is also vital to Queensland's economy: the reef and the rainforest are together worth A$1bn (\u00a3390m) each year. Before commercial logging was banned it generated A$50m. It shows \"you don't have to cut a rainforest down to derive an income from it,\" says wet tropics' Andrew McKenzie. </p> <p>Both bodies closely monitor and manage the impact of tourism on their territories. Their fates are inextricably linked. Sheriden Morris of the marine park authority judges water quality to be the biggest long-term threat to the reef. </p> <p>How the mainland is used determines what kind of water - and pollutants - drain off it and into the lagoon between coast and reef. If this water becomes too nitrate-rich from farmers' fertilisers and locals' sewage systems, green algae flourish, smothering and killing the coral. </p> <p>Quicksilver prides itself on its environmental record. It has accreditation from the eco-tourism association of Australia and employs 12 marine biologists to carefully monitor any impact its floating platform has on the reef. It needs to; if the reef disintegrated, its lucrative tourist trips would die out. </p> <p>As well as its preachy style of \"interpretive\" eco-tourism, Quicksilver takes several practical steps to minimise its adverse impact on water quality. It offers only cold showers for the snorkellers and scuba divers enjoying a day on the pontoon, to discourage what Quicksilver's chief biologist, Douglas Baird, calls \"Hollywood showers\"; lengthy soap-sudded affairs which produce detergent-filled waste water by the bucketload. </p> <p>But the dumping continues, because they use saltwater for much of their supply, and the local area lacks a sewage treatment plant sophisticated enough to deal with it. </p> <p>The council proposes to build one soon, but Quicksilver, with its 300 tourists a day, would probably require a whole plant itself. As planes packed with tourists continue to circle down from above the mountains into fast-growing Cairns, a strategy has been developed for the growth and management of tourism. </p> <p>Both reef and rainforest bodies pride themselves on it. \"We are probably the best-managed marine park in the world,\" claims Morris. </p> <p>The reef is zoned so that some sections are set aside for fishing and others for tourists. Some 80% of tourists are routed into just 5% of the reef and operators are required to pay environmental charges and meet stringent conditions before being granted permits to take visitors onto the reef. </p> <p>But, Morris admits: \"There has been a lot of talk about serious environmental management but not a lot done on the ground.\" </p> <p>The chief executive of wet tropics, Russell Watkinson, also concedes that they haven't married self-regulation with real legislation yet. For instance, they say that the state law introduced in February banning the clearing of rainforest has been, at best, \"flexible\". </p> <p>While McKenzie stresses there isn't a direct relation between the number of visitors and the impact caused, wet tropics knows the tourist business is a numbers game.</p> <p>\"Ultimately there will be a limit,\" admits Watkinson. Wet tropics has set a ceiling at 750,000 visitors a year, almost double the current number, but whether the tourist industry and the government will enforce it is another matter. </p> <p>The fragile ecology of the reef and rainforest may not be able to withstand the relentless influx of tourists. Many like the place so much that they want to buy a plot of land and build a house there. </p> <p>The main road that snakes up the coastline between rainforest and reef offers a typical environmental catch-22. Further north it becomes a dirt track, discouraging day-trippers. But the dust blown up by persistent vehicles settles on roadside vegetation during the dry season, and kills it off. Yet sealing the track with tarmac to stop the dust would simply increase the number of tourists heading further into the \"wilderness\". </p> <p>Morris says that Australia is perceived as a green country: \"But this is only because we are a young country and haven't had the time to bugger it up yet.\" Everyone involved with the reef and rainforest knows there is no shortage of people or opportunities to do so. </p> <p><b>Useful link:</b><br><a href=\"http://www.quicksilver-cruises.com\" target=\"_new\">Quicksilver Cruises</a></p>",
  "<p>A look in the car park at West Ham's training ground in Ilford tells you a good deal about Stuart Pearce. While the Hammers' flamboyant star striker, Paolo Di Canio, slides into his state-of the-art silver Jaguar, Pearce makes do with a bright red Mondeo. (\"It was only delivered yesterday,\" he says proudly.) Di Canio might win all the headlines, but Pearce is assured of the undying affection of Mondeo Men everywhere. </p> <p>Pearce, affectionately known as Psycho, is the People's Player, and it seems appropriate that he should be finishing his playing career - he is now 38, antediluvian by football standards - at West Ham. Even in this shiny, superficial corporate age, the Hammers remain loyal to their roots as a family club, a club that represents a tough pocket of East London. At the training ground a couple of hundred fans have gathered to ogle their idols and collect autographs. Pearce only joined last year, but he is already a folk hero here. </p> <p>Last season, Pearce broke his leg twice, enough you would think to finish the career of most players, let alone one who has played in the Premiership for the best part of two decades. But this season he is back in the first team, on a monthly contract, naturally taking each game as it comes, because at his age that's the way it has to be. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, when the then Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit decided that Pearce was finished as a player and humiliated him by playing youngsters in place of the seasoned international, he was ready to quit. But West Ham manager Harry Redknapp offered him a contract and Pearce, eager to prove Gullit wrong, jumped at it. </p> <p>\"I was a week away from retiring,\" he says. \"If Harry hadn't come in to get me, and if he hadn't been so supportive when I broke my leg twice last season, I wouldn't still be playing. When I broke my leg for the second time, he said 'we'll stick by you, get yourself right, and there'll be a new contract here for you'. There aren't many managers who would do that.\" </p> <p>Pearce, still a dependable left-back in a country strangely short of left-sided players, would probably have gone to this summer's European Championships if he had been fit. And even now he may add to his 78 England caps: some have suggested that Kevin Keegan will pick him to play against Germany in the World Cup qualifier at Wembley in October, in the final match at the stadium before it is bulldozed. It would be a glorious last hurrah for the old campaigner, and wonderfully resonant too. It was Pearce who missed the penalty that undermined England in the World Cup semi-final shoot-out against Germany in Italy in 1990. History demands redress. </p> <p>This week, Pearce will train with the England squad in the run-up to the friendly against France, passing on his experience but also staying in the frame in case the call comes. If it does, he will be there \"like a shot\". Pearce wears his patriotism on his sleeve, and on his face too: the emotions he has displayed in his games for his country - from the agony of 1990 to the ecstasy of Euro 96, when he was successful with a penalty against Spain in the quarter-finals - have endeared him to the public. \"A lot of people who watch football probably see a bit of themselves in me,\" he says. \"I give everything I've got, am reasonably aggressive, and they know they're going to get 100% out of me.\" </p> <p>Pearce has another task this week - launching his autobiography, a typically honest account of a career that has seen him play at the highest level for almost 20 years without winning anything beyond two League Cup medals with Nottingham Forest. In the book, he admits that his wife, Liz, calls him the \"nearly man\"; he both accepts the tag and uses it as a spur to drive himself on. </p> <p>\"I think I am the nearly man. I'm probably four semi-finals away from having a World Cup winners' medal, a European Championship medal, and maybe two FA Cup winners' medals. I've got two League Cup winners' medals to show for 17 years of professional football. But the fact that I haven't achieved as much as a lot of players gives me more motivation to carry on. There is always something there that I'm striving for. There are a lot of journeymen who have picked up as many medals as I have. But I am one of the 10 most-capped players that England have had: that's the thing I've got in my armoury. </p> <p>\"It annoys me that the big medals were always out of my grasp, but that spurred me on. When we came back from the World Cup in 1990, there was a feeling that we'd achieved a lot, but I thought 'hang on a minute, we've come back, we've won nothing'. Plus I'd missed the crucial penalty. That made me work harder. After that, I had the best season I'd ever had for Forest: adversity spurs me on more than people patting me on the back all the time.\" </p> <p>Pearce is supremely motivated, and that's why fans love him. He is talented, but it is what he makes of his talent that people admire. \"Every day you've got something to prove and once you've got that attitude you're halfway there,\" he says. \"When I signed for Newcastle in 1997, I signed with John Barnes and Ian Rush. We all got put into the same category of old players at the end of our careers, but, with no disrespect to them, I felt that my attiitude was different to theirs. They'd come from Liverpool with a sackful of medals; I'd come from Forest with nothing. They're not playing now and I am; people put us in the same category but I didn't because I was still hungry for the game. </p> <p>\"I always have something to motivate me. When I came here last year, it was to prove Ruud Gullit wrong and show that I was still good enough to play in the Premiership. Now it's proving to people that I can come back from two broken legs. I want to prove to the manager that he was right to bring me here. I'm on a monthly contract, but if he offered me a one-year contract and I broke my leg again, I'd rip the contract up. I wouldn't want to take money for nothing; I want to earn it. I've always wanted to give value for money and I believe I've done that at all the clubs I've been at.\" </p> <p>Pearce's work ethic and unflagging motivation are rooted in his background. His father was a waiter who worked 18-hour days to provide for his four children and buy a house in Shepherd's Bush. Once he had paid the mortgage, he sold the house, bought a house outright in Wembley and got a job as a postman, allowing him to see his family occasionally. That discipline and level-headedness rubbed off on Pearce junior, who trained as an electrician while playing non-league football for Wealdstone in his late teens, and made sure his job was kept open for him when he was snapped up by Bobby Gould at Coventry at the late-starting age of 21. </p> <p>\"It wasn't until after a couple of years at Forest that I realised I probably was good enough,\" he says. \"I didn't know whether it was going to work for me or not, but I did have a qualification as an electrician. The fact that I was a late starter and missed my first five years may have been a spur to play on longer.\" </p> <p>Does he regret not having joined one of the super-clubs that now divide up the spoils between them? \"No. Every time I've made a decision about my career, apart from what side to hit the penalty, I think it's been the right decision. I don't look back with regrets. I was always happy at Forest, the fans were magnificent to me, those were the halcyon days of my career, and I think I did the right thing staying put. If I'd gone to a bigger club, I know I'd have a lot more medals now, but I also know it was the right decision to stay.\" </p> <p> He was managed at Forest by the legendary Brian Clough. He talks about him in the way people talk about the Krays - firm but fair, loved him and loathed him, great motivator but ruled by fear. \"I was scared of him when I went there, but I respected him. There were good times and bad times. I can remember turning up for training and hating his guts, then by the end of training loving the man.\" </p> <p>Pearce rates Clough as one of the three best managers he's played under, the others being Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, both of whom, he believes, had more to offer to England. \"England got rid of Hoddle too quickly,\" he says. \"He should be given another chance somewhere down the road, but he probably won't be. We shoot ourselves in the foot too often.\" </p> <p>Pearce himself had a spell of management in the darkest days at Forest, when Clough's successor Frank Clark had been sacked and Pearce was left to pick up the pieces at a club hurtling out of the Premiership. The club was in dire straits financially and when a new board finally took over, there was no place for Pearce, who ended his 12-year love affair with Forest and headed off for his unhappy spell at Newcastle. </p> <p>In many ways, Pearce is a throwback to a more innocent footballing age, when fans felt in touch with players and had a sense of ownership of clubs. \"There've been a lot of changes in football while I've been playing. The plc side of things is quite alien to me. We used to have a big Christmas party at Forest, but that never happened at Newcastle. We had to pay to hire the ground for a players' Christmas party. You could turn up to see the chairman and they didn't know who you were at reception.\" </p> <p>But, regardless of those changes and the bleak end to his time at Forest, Pearce is determined to carve out a new career as a manager when his playing days finally end. He is collecting coaching qualifications - something many top players hoping to make the transition to management have failed to do in the past - and by next summer will be ready to start applying for jobs. It is one of the compensations of the uncertain world of football that the gnarled old player can overnight turn into the fresh-faced young manager. </p> <p>Inevitably, Pearce's autobiography is called Psycho, and he stares out from the cover with a gaze of steely intensity. But don't let that fool you. While he plays it hard on the pitch, off it he is polite and easygoing: a private man for whom family life - a farmhouse in Wiltshire, a wife who keeps horses, a two-year-old daughter called Chelsea (why not Forest?) - is very important. He says he still likes a drink and can let his hair down with friends, but he is definitely a lover of old-style football clubs rather than new-style nightclubs. </p> <p>\"The Psycho nickname was just a bit of fun,\" he says. \"In the 80s everyone was called Psycho or Rambo. It doesn't represent what I'm like away from football. You've got to be a bit more cute than that. If you're an idiot and try to live up to your nickname, you won't last very long. I'd like to think there's a little bit more about me than that. A lot of journalists were pigeonholing me as a lunatic who shouldn't represent England because I'd get sent off all the time. But in 78 games for England I've been booked five times and never been sent off. I've only been sent off three times playing for my club, which in this day and age is quite an achievement.\" </p> <p>So not Psycho. And not the Nearly Man either.</p> <p>\u0095 Psycho: Stuart Pearce's Autobiography is published by Headline , price \u00a317.99</p>",
  "Labour is to promise an apprenticeship place to all 16 to 18-year-olds in a skills and training package which is set to be included in the party's manifesto. <p>David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, wants to address the 100,000 16- and 17-year-olds who \"drop out\" every year, and neither stay on in education nor go into work. A report published this year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said Britain had a poor record in smoothing the transition to work for young people. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett believes that the guarantee, to be in place for September 2001, maps a route for young people to aim for if they choose not to stay in full-time education. The proposal, agreed at Labour's national policy forum in July, goes before the party conference next month and is very likely to form a plank of the manifesto. </p> <p>Most apprenticeships will be organised by the private sector. But Mr Blunkett is confident that the public sector, which pays fees to training colleges, can expand if necessary. About 250,000 16 to 18-year-olds are on private and public schemes - 80,000 have been taken on under the government's modern apprenticeship scheme. Mr Blunkett wants to expand these numbers. </p> <p>He also proposes to give union \"learning representatives\" a legal right to paid release from work. A union learning fund launched by the Department for Education and Employment in 1997 has established 2,000 learning representatives in large and medium-sized companies. </p> <p>Backed by the fund, worth \u00a310m, the representatives encourage and advise workers on further training and negotiate with employers to get time and facilities to do it. </p> <p>Though the details are not finalised, Mr Blunkett wants to put learning representatives on a statutory footing. He believes they can become \"footsoldiers\" for raising skills standards, and \"workplace experts\" on skills issues. Smaller firms that are exempt from trade union legislation will not be affected. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett also said he had brokered an agreement by employers and unions on an alternative to restoring a training levy. Labour ended its long-held policy in support of training levies, which legally obliged firms to fund training in their sector, in 1996. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett wants to nurture existing training schemes agreed voluntarily within a particular industry sector and, where employers and union request, support the scheme through law. Some sectors are opposed to a training levy. But in others, big companies and unions support it because it sidelines cowboy firms. For instance, in the construction industry, there is a skills contribution scheme, backed by employers and unions and renewed each year. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett is particularly keen on transferable training loans being piloted by the gas industry, where big companies fund training. Under the plan, individual companies do not lose their investment when an employee they have trained moves to another company in the sector. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett believes the scheme could become a blueprint for elsewhere and, if successful, he would be prepared to give it statutory backing. </p> <p>He is also promising to strengthen national training organisations, funded by employers with government and European Union money, that promote skills in 76 sectors ranging from accountancy to the water industry. </p> <p>\u0095 The Institute of Directors yesterday called for improvements to the modern apprenticeship scheme. They also demanded more resources to made available for smaller firms to help train employees, and communication and information technology skills to made integral to courses. </p> <p>Only 14% of British workers had intermediate level vocational qualifications, compared with 46% of employees in Germany, the institute pointed out in a report.</p>"
