  "<p>Sir Richard Branson may have to withstand a legal challenge in the European courts if he is to fulfil his dream of running the national lottery. </p> <p>Camelot said yesterday it was prepared to continue its fight to hold on to its licence, even if its application for a judicial review of the national lottery commission's decision to give only Sir Richard more time to improve his bid is rejected by the high court tomorrow. </p> <p>It is incensed that the commission gave Sir Richard an extra month when it rejected both pitches for the licence. </p> <p>\"We believe that the commission's ruling was totally unfair and we will do all that we can to get a fair hearing,\" a Camelot insider said yesterday. \"It is unlikely we will end it at the high court if we don't think we have had a fair chance to put our case.\" </p> <p>Camelot is so determined to keep the licence that it has considered buying GTech, the US company blamed for its failure to get it renewed. </p> <p>It believes that by installing its own management and demonstrating greater control it can change the commission's belief that GTech is not a \"fit and proper\" supplier to a national lottery bidder. </p> <p>Alternatively, it has considered buying software from GTech and operating it rather than letting GTech run it. </p> <p>GTech itself is thought to be considering a legal challenge to the commission's decision. </p> <p>\"GTech has the best operational record of any lottery operator in the world and for the past seven years has helped sell millions of tickets to millions of happy customers in the UK,\" a Camelot spokeswoman said. </p> <p>Sir Richard is expected to start talks on Wednesday with banks and his suppliers about providing an extra \u00a350m in security should lottery ticket sales be lower than expected. </p> <p>It is thought that he will provide around half the sum in the form of an irrevocable bank loan guaranteed against personal assets, with his suppliers making up the balance. </p> <p>Camelot's determination not to give up the fight follows a weekend of potentially damaging revelations about AWI, the US company which is the key technology supplier to Sir Richard's People's Lottery bid. </p> <p>The allegations of incompetence, delays, fines and resignations are similar to those experienced by GTech. </p> <p>Its founder and his successor were sacked and its most recent boss has been sued by the company. It was fined $1m in 1996 for failing to deliver software for the Minnesota state lottery on time, and has been involved in a legal dispute with the Arizona lottery after a series of complaints and software failures. </p> <p>But Dame Helena Shovelton, head of the commission, is reported to have described the revelations as \"historical\" and to be happy with AWI's record.</p>",
  "Three Israeli soldiers died at the weekend in a bungled attempt to arrest a Palestinian activist in the West Bank. The Israeli chief of staff, Shaul Mofaz, suggested yesterday there had been a \"serious operational mishap\" and said he could not rule out the possibility that the soldiers - members of the elite Duvdevan undercover unit - had been killed by \"friendly fire\". <p>The troops were looking for Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a leader of the Islamist Hamas movement, who is suspected of organising two bombings in Jerusalem in 1997 which killed at least 26 people, including five bombers, in an outdoor market and a pedestrian precinct. The Israelis say he has plotted further attacks and is at the top of their wanted list. </p> <p>Late on Saturday night hundreds of Israeli soldiers entered Assira al-Shamaliyeh, a village of 8,000 people known as a Hamas stronghold. They sealed it off, imposed a curfew and conducted house-to-house searches. Villagers ignored the curfew, taking to the streets to hurl stones and burn tyres, while Israeli helicopters with searchlights circled overhead. </p> <p>At one point, according to Major-General Yitzhak Eitan, the Israeli commander responsible for the West Bank, Abu Hanoud and another man, Nidal Daglas, fired at the troops from outside Daglas's home. In the ensuing battle, three Israeli soldiers were killed and one wounded. Abu Hanoud and Daglas were also injured. </p> <p>Israeli forces arrested Daglas and an army bulldozer demolished his home, but Abu Hanoud escaped to Nablus which, unlike the village, is under full Palestinian control. </p> <p>Voice of Palestine radio said Abu Hanoud had given himself up to the Palestinian authorities in Nablus, where he was treated for gunshot wounds to his shoulder. He was placed under heavy guard, with dozens of Palestinian officers patrolling the hospital grounds and others watching from rooftops. </p> <p>The raid on Assira came at a critical stage in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, which Hamas opposes. Yesterday, according to Israel Radio, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, declined to say whether he would ask the Palestinians to hand over Abu Hanoud. </p> <p>The deputy defence minister, Ephraim Sneh, praised the Palestinian authorities for \"making a very serious effort\" to prevent terrorist attacks. \"We are coordinating with them all the time, and they knew about this operation not before, but after it began,\" he said. </p> <p>But a Palestinian negotiator, Hassan Asfour, accused Israel of keeping the Palestinian Authority in the dark. \"The lack of coordination is an expression of disrespect for the Palestinian side,\" he said. \"The result, the killing of three Israeli soldiers, was a natural outcome of their stupid policy.\" </p> <p>Earlier this month Palestinian police arrested about a dozen Hamas members and uncovered what they said was an explosives laboratory in Nablus. </p> <p>Saturday's clash was the bloodiest for the Israelis in the West Bank since September 1996, when nine soldiers were killed in Palestinian riots sparked by the opening of an tunnel in occupied East Jerusalem. </p> <p>Mahmoud al-Zahhar, a Hamas official, hailed the Israeli casualties as \"one of the remarkable successes of Hamas in achieving their goal and defeating the Israelis\". He said: \"The number of losses indicates that Hamas is still a strong organisation.\" </p> <p>Israeli troops continued to enforce a curfew on Assira yesterday. About 150 residents who had been shut out waited to return to their homes.</p>",
  "<p>At the dawn of the third industrial revolution in the north, based on knowledge, millions of people in the south are still waiting for the benefits of the second - electricity, motor and air transport, the telephone. Yet the latest wheeze among policymakers in developed countries is to alleviate poverty in developing countries with computers and mobile phones. It sounds like a sick joke until you realise that they are deadly serious. </p> <p>At all the big international meetings so far this year - Davos in January, Washington in the spring, Okinawa last month - the hottest topic on the development agenda was how to harness the power of information and communication technology to improve the lot of the poor. </p> <p>Struck by the apparent ability of ICT to transform the performance of the US economy, envious governments in Japan, Britain and the rest of Europe have all been attempting to replicate the experience of America to boost the incomes of their citizens for some time. Now they want to spread the fruits of higher productivity further afield. </p> <p>The potential benefits of ICT to developing countries are not in doubt. The \"death of distance\" brought about by the internet allows professional services, such as software, education/training, medicine and law to be provided remotely. It opens up new opportunities in marketing, purchasing and collaboration with large numbers of potential suppliers and customers over a large geographical area. It puts separated family members in touch with each other, spreads knowledge with ease and democratises government in places where the authorities allow the internet to flourish. </p> <p>Some of the gains are already being realised and can be seen in Andhra Pradesh, the first Indian state to put government online; in Chile, which has been a leader in wiring schools; in Delhi where Harrods is thinking about out sourcing a customer helpline; and in Morocco where local craftsmen are selling their wares to a global market on E-Souk.com. </p> <p>But it does not take a genius to figure out that ICT is of limited use in places without the right physical infrastructure, level of education, business environment, and stable and democratic political regimes, effectively excluding vast swathes of the planet's population. </p> <p>Hence the experience of ICT use to date. For while ICT is spreading rapidly through developing countries - in 1995-98 developing countries connected more than 155m telephone lines, 105m mobile subscribers and 4m leased lines - the figures disguise a wide disparity between them and also with the north, where growth is even faster, opening up a huge and expanding digital divide between rich and poor nations. </p> <p>In Africa, for example, with 739m people, there are only 14m phone lines - fewer than in Manhattan - and 80% of those are in six countries. The geographical distribution of internet hosts further illustrates the wide differences in connectivity between rich and poor countries. While last year Britain had 15m internet subscribers, there were only 1m on the African continent. The average rich industrialised country has roughly 40 times the per capita number of computers of a sub-Saharan African country (excluding South Africa), 100 times as many mobile phones, and 1,600 times as many internet hosts. </p> <p>Unless, the north intervenes to equalise the situation, the south will fall further behind, widening the yawning gap between rich and poor nations to even more obscene proportions. </p> <p>Rising to the challenge will require the involvement of both the private and public sectors. In countries where there is a market for their products and services, hi-tech companies will not need any persuading to enter. After all, in an industry where prices are tumbling, they need high-volume markets to keep their shareholders happy. But they will shun countries where there is no prospect of a juicy profit. Market failure dictates that rich countries must intervene and help developing countries with technical advice and large sums of money so that they can lay the foundations of an information society. </p> <p><strong> Bridging the gap</strong><br> </p> <p> Thankfully, efforts are already under way to bridge the digital divide. Institutions such as the World Bank have long recognised the potential of ICT as a development tool, setting up, for example, InfoDev, a multi-donor grant facility with the objective of promoting innovative ICT projects in poor countries. The World Bank's latest plan is to establish the Global Development Gateway, an internet portal which will act as a one-stop shop for those interested in development issues, although it is dogged by controversy over control of content. </p> <p>In Okinawa, the Group of Eight - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia - agreed to set up the Digital Opportunities Taskforce (Dot Force), comprising two representatives, one public, one private, from each country. By next year's summit in Genoa, Dot Force is expected to have formulated a global action plan to help bridge the digital divide. </p> <p>While welcome, what is missing from all this activity is one crucial element - some humility about what can be achieved. Amid all the hype surrounding the internet, there is a danger that governments will be diverted from the most important task, that of ensuring people in developing countries have clean water, basic education and the drugs needed to fight preventable diseases. As Francisco Rodriguez and Ernest J Wilson, of the University of Maryland, put it in their InfoDev working paper, entitled Are Poor Countries Losing the Information Revolution?, the poor need penicillin before Pentiums. </p> <p>That should not prevent governments in the north pursuing their ICT development agenda but a story from Uganda, quoted in another InfoDev working paper by staff at the World Bank, makes sobering reading. </p> <p>Kisiize Hospital in the south-west of the country, 400 miles from Kampala, has tried for many years to obtain a connection from the national telephone company. But remoteness from the nearest exchange thwarted its efforts. Telephone technology, coupled with the launch of a second national carrier, gave it new hope. But the hospital's location at the bottom of a valley required the installation of at least two relay towers at prohibitive cost. </p> <p>So it finally opted for a satellite connection. But the high capital cost problem that prevented the installation of the relay towers has turned into an operating cost problem. A call costs the equivalent of about $2.50 a minute, about 30 times call rates in an industrialised country. A nurse once held on for 10 minutes trying to find out the date and duration of her next training course before giving up. Instead, she got into the next 4am minibus and, six bumpy hours later, was in Kampala where she was able to get the information she needed. The cost of her round trip? The same as a five minute telephone call.</p>",
  "There is probably no bigger embarrassment in Sierra Leone than surrendering your weapons to the West Side Boys. Of all the thugs masquerading as armies in the stricken west African country, they come the closest to pure banditry. <p>The humiliation of the 11 captured British soldiers will be compounded by memories of the scorn poured on United Nations peacekeepers when they surrendered in their hundreds without a shot to the rebel Revolutionary United Front, helping to precipitate the British intervention in Sierra Leone in May. </p> <p>To add to the pain, the West Side Boys are supposed to be on the government's side, and may well have grabbed the soldiers with British-made guns. </p> <p>The Boys - who sometimes call themselves the West Side Niggaz - run the most feared roadblocks in government-held territory because they give the convincing impression of being more than willing to pull the trigger. </p> <p>They are a motley collection of young men with an array of weapons, although among the machetes and Kalashnikovs can always be found British guns. </p> <p>Their clothing is just as varied. Women's wigs and the bloodied uniforms of dead enemies are favoured. Flipflops are the norm. </p> <p>The fighters, mostly in their teens, control an area east of Freetown around the strategic town of Masiaka, which was the scene of fierce fighting between the rebels and British-backed government forces in May, including the West Side Boys, who by some accounts fought well. </p> <p>Masiaka sits on the main road linking Freetown with the international airport at Lungi, two hours' drive away. The British soldiers are believed to have been grabbed at one of the roadblocks where the militiamen spend much of the day trying to stave off hunger and the blistering heat by sucking on \"morale boosters\", small plastic sachets of cheap gin and whisky. </p> <p><b> Drunk</b><br> </p> <p> There the Boys, and the occasional Girl, ferment until some unsuspecting driver happens upon the roadblock. A few cigarettes or a couple of bottles of alcopop can usually buy a smooth passage but the mood can easily sour, especially in the late afternoon when the young militiamen are very drunk. Then they take everything they want, including, on occasions, the car. There have also been accusations of rape. </p> <p>Five weeks ago, UN peacekeepers cleared illegal West Side Boys roadblocks but a few days later they were back as the government admitted that the aggressive youths were once again threatening and stealing from civilians driving between the capital and the airport. </p> <p>Some of the West Side Boys have been disarmed. Others have been signed up for British training for the new army, but most are not interested in abandoning the undisciplined and relatively lucrative life of a militiaman answerable only to his colleagues. </p> <p>The British have nearly 300 soldiers in Sierra Leone, one-third of them training the country's new army to fight the RUF, and the rest providing security for the training team. The captured men are from the 1st Royal Irish Regiment which is based in Benguema, outside Freetown. It is not clear if they are part of the training or security contingent. </p> <p>It is probable that the West Side Boys can be bought off to release the British soldiers, or persuaded with threats of force. Mostly they are disgruntled at having been cut loose by Johnny Paul Koroma, the former military ruler they once served. He is now in pursuit of respectability and claims to have stood down all his forces. </p> <p>The Boys have shown a willingness to fight it out with their own side. In May, government forces had to abandon a strategic town, Lunsar, after the youths started fighting with regular forces over access to ammunition. A few months ago they might have switched sides to the RUF, but the rebels have suffered a number of military defeats recently and are on the back foot. </p> <p>While the capture of the British soldiers is embarrassing, it is unlikely to prove a serious setback in the war against the RUF, whose founder, Foday Sankoh, remains under guard in Freetown after his capture in May. </p> <p>Last week the RUF replaced Mr Sankoh as its leader with a volatile young officer, Brigadier Issa Sesay, 29. The government says this could lead to a negotiated end to the war, with the RUF finally surrendering its weapons as it agreed but failed to do under last year's peace accords. \"We don't expect him [Sesay] to behave like Sankoh because he knows the consequences,\" said the information minister, Julius Spencer. </p> <p><b> Vicious</b><br> </p> <p> It may indeed be that Brig Issa, as he is known, has been persuaded that the RUF is doomed as a military force but he is also notoriously unstable and a volatile drunk. Some of the UN hostages who crossed his path this year described him as vicious and with a deep hatred of white people. He is also much feared inside the RUF. </p> <p>The change in leadership came after the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, visited Mr Sankoh in captivity and carried away a letter authorising the handover. Mr Obasanjo described Mr Sankoh as having lost a lot of weight and as out of touch with events. He mistakenly believed that one of his principal backers, Charles Taylor, had been overthrown as president of Liberia. He also appeared to know nothing of a plan by the UN and Sierra Leone's government to put him on trial before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity. </p> <p>The government has released 171 lower-level rebel prisoners as a gesture of goodwill, to encourage the RUF forces to give up the fight. President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's administration has been reinforcing southern cities in preparation for an attempt to seize the diamond fields after the rains pass. </p> <p> <b>The road to captivity</b><br></p> <p> <b> July 1999</b> Peace deal in civil war falls apart when Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front renews fighting </p> <p><b> May 3</b> Rebels seize 21 UN peacekeepers </p> <p><b> May 6</b> 318 UN peacekeepers captured </p> <p><b> May 7</b> 600 British troops arrive \"to evacuate British and EU citizens\" but remit is extended to supporting UN </p> <p><b> May 17</b> Sankoh captured </p> <p><b> June 15</b> Royal Marines pull out leaving training team of 90 and offshore backup force of 200 </p> <p><b> June 18</b> British aid worker Alan Smith freed after six weeks in rebel hands </p> <p><b> June 30</b> UN peacekeeper from Jordan killed in ambush </p> <p><b> Friday August 25</b> 11 British soldiers disappear at 3.45pm near Freetown </p> <p><b> Yesterday</b> Confirmation that their captors are West Side Boys, an undisciplined splinter from government coalition.

  "The prospect of a terrorist bombing campaign being launched in Britain with devices never seen before by the security services was raised yesterday after a cache of explosives was unearthed in an Oxfordshire wood. <p>Six army bomb disposal experts worked for almost 48 hours to make safe eight sophisticated bombs, packed with brass nuts and designed to kill or maim, which had been found buried at a former police training centre. </p> <p>Police refused to speculate on the identity of the terrorists, although it was thought unlikely that Irish splinter groups were responsible. </p> <p>They have not ruled out a theory that the bombmakers were racists planning to target the Notting Hill carnival, which was taking place yesterday and today, nor that animal rights activists could have made the devices - though they are much more sophisticated than such groups are known to have used before. </p> <p>Police are comparing the devices with another found on a stone wall at a farm 30 miles away in Gloucestershire last Sunday, and which could have been meant as a test but failed to go off. </p> <p>The cache was found by a man walking his dog at Eynsham Hall, near Witney, on Friday afternoon. The animal was attracted by the smell of the explosive and pawed at loose soil beneath a tree. </p> <p>Bomb experts spent Friday evening, all day Saturday and yesterday morning making the devices safe. Yesterday afternoon search teams continued to comb the area in case other devices had been hidden. The bombs were taken to a laboratory in Kent for examination. </p> <p>Police were surprised by the sophistication of the devices. Constructed out of clear plastic water bottles with more than 150 brass nuts packed into the bottom, they featured anti-handling mechanisms which meant they could have exploded if touched. </p> <p>It is thought that if detonated, the nuts would fly out like shrapnel, possibly as far as 500 metres. Police believe the devices had only been buried for a matter of days. </p> <p>Det Supt John Donlon, of Thames Valley police, said: \"It's very unusual to find devices so sophisticatedly put together, with such finesse and complication. They are expertly put together and were designed to maim or kill.\" </p> <p>He suggested that those who made the bombs might have a military or private-sector explosives background and would have to be highly intelligent to construct the \"unique\" devices. </p> <p>Police were not immediately certain how the bombs were to have been detonated. It was possible they had a timer, were \"victim-activated\" or made to explode via remote control. </p> <p>Experts believe they could not have been built from amateur instructions in the manner described by David Copeland, the London nail-bomber. Nor were they the sort of devices Irish terrorists commonly use. </p> <p>\"We believe that they may have been created by groups with new, different methods,\" Mr Donlon said. \"Or it may be that a new group has different members who have different methods of putting bombs together.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I would hope this find by a member of the public has thwarted a campaign and that lives have been saved. I would also hope that we have found as many as there are hidden.\" </p> <p>Asked about the possibility of a threat to the Notting Hill carnival, Mr Donlon said: \"We're looking at that very closely with the anti-terrorist branch. Because of things which have been said during the week to the promoters of the carnival, that is one thing we are looking at.\" </p> <p>Threats have been made to people connected with the carnival but yesterday Insp Rod Childs, a liaison officer, said there were no specific intelligence reports linking the cache to Notting Hill.</p>",
  "A leading loyalist politician linked to one of the factions in the bloody turf war on the streets of Belfast yesterday quashed reports that the paramilitaries had agreed a 72-hour ceasefire. <p>John White, chairman of the Ulster Democratic Party, which has links with the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Freedom Fighters, said he had seen no evidence of a truce with the Ulster Volunteer Force. </p> <p>But Mr White, a close associate of the jailed terrorist leader Johnny Adair, said a lot of hard work was going on behind the scenes. \"I would hope that there would be a permanent truce in the days that lie ahead. But, unfortunately, I can't say that there is any evidence to indicate that there is a truce at this moment.\" </p> <p>It was reported that secret negotiations between the UDA the UVF and key aides of first minister David Trimble, who is out of the province on holiday, had taken place on Saturday. </p> <p>But Mr White, who served a 14-year jail sentence for the double murder of a Catholic politician and his Protestant secretary, said the violence in the Protestant stronghold had to be sorted out by the people of the Shankill Road. </p> <p>Mr White again criticised Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, for ordering the return to jail of Johnny Adair last week. He said the minister's comments about Adair not having much influence because his supporters had not taken to the streets showed a lack of knowledge. </p> <p>\"I think it illustrates how naive he is. He clearly knows nothing about community politics and how paramilitaries work. The UDA had the capacity to put large numbers on the streets, but \"did not want to see the Shankill torn apart\". </p> <p>Four men were yesterday still being questioned by police about the murder of Sam Rocket, 22, whose family are connected to the UVF. Mr Rocket, who was gunned down in front of his girlfriend and 18-month-old daughter on Wednesday night, became the third victim of the feud. Thousands of UVF supporters turned out for his funeral on Saturday. </p> <p>The shooting is believed to have been carried out by the UFF in retaliation for the murders two days before of leading UDA man Jackie Coulter and Bobby Mahood, who were also buried last week. </p> <p>In Coleraine, Co Londonderry, security forces defused two pipe bombs thrown through the living room windows of houses on a loyalist estate. Families were evacuated from several houses During searches in loyalist north Belfast, police seized a series of items and sent them for forensic examination.</p>",
  "The safety of the meningitis immunisation programme came under scrutiny yesterday when it emerged that 11 people have died following injections. <p>Health officials insisted the deaths were not connected to the injection and maintained the programme was completely safe but the handling of the issue was criticised. </p> <p>Since the immunisation programme began last year, more than 16,000 \"adverse reactions\" to the vaccine have been reported to the medicines control agency. </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said two of the 11 had heart conditions, two died of group B meningitis - for which there is no vaccine - and one of a convulsion 10 days after the injection. The six others died of cot death. </p> <p>She added that the number of adverse reactions - which can range from a minor headache to death - was not unusual for the scale of the programme, the first in Europe. </p> <p>Officials from the Meningitis Research Foundation and Meningitis Trust said they were certain that immunisation was saving lives. </p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Liam Fox, said he was angry that no minister had come forward to quell public anxiety. \"If the public suspects that the government is withholding information, there is a danger they will lose confidence in the programme. The only way to dispel this is for a minister to say there is no basis for it. </p> <p>\"Instead they are hiding behind civil servants. That is stupid and cowardly. Ministers are paid take responsibility.\" </p> <p>John Fletcher, of the vaccination campaign group, Justice Awareness Basic Support, said: \"They always say there is no problem. Parents need to have all the information so they can make a balanced judgement. </p> <p>\"We have had many calls from parents whose children have suffered adverse reactions and believe the programme was introduced too quickly. In effect, ordinary people are the guinea pigs.\"</p>",
  "Hundreds of football hooligans could be prevented from leaving the country ahead of England's match against France in Paris on Saturday and banned from attending matches for up to 10 years under legislation which comes into force today. <p>The Football (Disorder) Act 2000 was introduced following violence caused by England fans at Euro 2000, which led to criticism of the government for failing to clamp down on trouble makers travelling abroad. </p> <p>Under the new law, police will for the first time have the right to ban those they suspect of taking part in football hooliganism even though they might not have a conviction. </p> <p>Many hooligans causing trouble during Euro 2000 were known to British police but could not be prevented from leaving the country because thay had not been convicted of a football offence </p> <p>Courts are expected to impose banning orders this week on known and suspected hooligans, from information provided by police, in an attempt to prevent them from travelling to Paris. </p> <p>The new law provides for a five-day control period in the run up to big matches abroad during which a banning order or notice to serve one can be imposed at any time. </p> <p>Surrender of passports will also become mandatory.

  "Rosemary and I are off to an Over Fifties Festival. Promises of wine-tasting and line-dancing have tempted us. But as we follow the little black arrows pointing to Over Fifties, Over Fifties, Over Fifties, I begin to feel rather glum. We are trooping along with all the other old people, which means that we are old as well. I didn't think I minded, but I do. I should have brought my mother as a cover. Then I could have pretended it was all for her benefit. I would have been the young person shoving the old, infirm one about in a wheelchair, but this time I am here on my own account. Horrid. <p>Rosemary and I enter a large room full of tables covered in leaflets. We can do arts and crafts, gardening, IT courses, genealogy, bowls, sitting-down aerobics, reminisce, be feminists and have a health check or free massage. I am in there like a shot but Rosemary takes one look and runs away. </p> <p>Who can blame her? This isn't your glamorous Covent Garden Sanctuary. It's lardy bodies covered in pale towels and flobbed about on tables - the last chance saloon. </p> <p>That is the difference. Daughter is keen on exercise and healthy pursuits and alternative therapies for fun. I am grasping on to them like a drowning woman. </p> <p>But just as we are about to run home and cry, we pass a hall full of people exercising sitting down to the music of the second world war. We join in. For some reason this perks Rosemary up. I can't think why. It only reminds us of Izal lavatory paper and rationing, which just shows how old we are. We plod on with our fun day out, have a divine ethnic lunch, but something is still wrong. </p> <p>\"Perhaps it's a bit earnest and worthy,\" says Rosemary. She is right. We fancy something more wild and pointless. My father may have been on the right track. At 79, he suddenly buzzed off to the south of France, didn't even book a seat, slept in the train corridor, arrived, hurried to the betting shop and won \u00a31,100 (picked the first three horses home).

  "If you are one of the 25m or so foreign visitors to Britain this year, you would do well to avoid meeting Christopher Henley, from Chiswick, west London. It's nothing personal. Henley is a pleasant, thoughtful and courteous chap. It's just that he happens to be in charge of one of the world's most specialised firms of undertakers - the man who is on 24-hour standby to ensure that if you are one of the 1,800 or so foreigners who annually have the misfortune to die on a trip here, your family, if they are with you, will be offered comfort by a multilingual grief expert, the complex bureaucracy of your untimely demise will be expedited and your remains airfreighted back to your home country in a suitably dignified manner. <p>Henley doesn't only look after foreign nationals who die here. If, as happened 1,581 times last year, you're a Brit and die abroad, he or one of his two competitor firms, will be on your case. His mobile phone awaits the call from your relatives, or more likely their travel insurers. </p> <p>Indeed, as operations manager of Henley Wright, International Funeral Directors, Henley's renown and experience in the funereal customs of almost every nation and religion mean that even if you aren't British and die in a corner of some foreign beach, he may still be in the background, discreetly arranging your last journey by phone and fax from Putney. </p> <p>As we chat in his office, he is dealing with a fax from a Danish insurance company asking for his best price to ship three deceased from a Greek island, the Canaries and Cyprus back to Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Happily, almost all deaths abroad are covered by insurance; if they are not, embassies, consulates or relatives back home invariably step in with payment. </p> <p>The cost of preparing a body, placing it in a basic oak, zinc-lined coffin and handling is \u00a3950, with no charge at all made for under 16s. The company also has preferential airfreight rates, typically \u00a3315 for an average weight body, say, to the east coast of the States. </p> <p>It is evident that Henley really does have the deepest sympathy. \"People are at their lowest ebb when they see a funeral director,\" he says. \"But when the person has died abroad, they're going to be at a lower ebb still, if that can be imagined.\" </p> <p>However, Henley Wright is also a business, and at the same time, Henley is also buzzing about in preparation for the all-important US Embassy's occasional visit to Putney later in the week to check out that the facilities continue to be suitably excellent for the accommodation of deceased Americans. </p> <p>The hiatus gives me a chance to acclimatise to the unsettling experience of being at a funeral director's while not a bereaved customer. There are certificates all around attesting to Henley's international qualifications. There are glossy coffin catalogues that prompt me to wonder why anyone would require a casket with 24 carat gold-plated fittings, or why anybody would pay extra for a sprung bed in their coffin - and what the heck is the attraction of buying a coffin which comes, as the best models do, with a guarantee. </p> <p>Most oddly disturbing, however, is the office calendar, courtesy of United Airlines Cargo Division. I had given some thought to my meeting with Henley, but it had never occurred in such bald terms that if you're unfortunate enough to die abroad, whether you travelled out economy or club, you are flown back in the hold. To confirm this there are diplomas from airlines affirming that Henley has passed courses in the transport of infectious substances and in the freight of dangerous goods - that's you and me after being embalmed in formalin, which is hazardous to airplanes. </p> <p>I wonder what kind of stories lead to tourists ending up in a deluxe coffin in Putney en route to a cargo hold. Henley is more than a little reticent here. Discretion and sensitivity in the extreme are the essentials of his business. That might mean anything from remaining totally mum about just whom Fred was with when he died to avoiding any suggestion of just how Jose came to die of a \"fall\". </p> <p>Not that Henley would think of it. He is a fourth-generation funeral director and extremely proud of his profession. His retired father was awarded the OBE with the unique citation: \"Desmond Charles Henley, Embalmer, for services in the aftermath of disasters.\" Henley, although he is managing a business, makes a point of getting involved when he can with the core skills of undertaking, handling the bodies, preparing the coffins - everything except embalming, which he is not qualified in. </p> <p>It would be easy to imagine such technicalities, along with the legalities of dealing with and moving human remains around the world, swamping the need to be sensitive, but Henley has the bearing of a highly effectual vicar, dispensing sympathy while always ahead of the game. He knows precisely how one country insists on sealing at each end the coffins of its deceased in the presence of a vice consul, while another doesn't mind, and how particular countries will require an embassy official to view the body and match it up with the deceased's passport picture. </p> <p>All the airlines, on the other hand, have similar rules on shipping bodies. Coffins must be metal-lined and carried in a hold designated only for human remains, normally called Hold 5. Airlines very rarely allow more than one coffin (internationally coded HUM for human remains) to be carried on a scheduled flight, as a mark of respect to the deceased. This rigid rule means that when an entire family dies, its members still often have to be shipped back one by one. And under no circumstances will any airline ship a coffin on the same aircraft as either food or live animals. \"Animals,\" Henley says, \"have a sixth sense and become very distressed in the presence of dead humans.\" </p> <p>As I left, I had to ask Henley whether, especially when he goes on his diving holidays, he ever imagines ending up as a client of his own firm. I imagine knowing how grimly holidays can end would put a lot of people off the idea of going abroad at all. \"Am I going to be a victim of my own success?\" he replies, smiling. \"Well, my job certainly makes you more aware of your own mortality.\"</p>",
  "At one time they were like ghosts, disembarking at night and hidden in the mountains by the time dawn revealed their footprints on the beach. <p>Sunbathers might find plastic bags of soggy bread and soiled clothes, but uninvited entry into the first world was generally discreet. </p> <p>They were Moroccans who had crossed the Gibraltar strait to southern Spain. </p> <p>Capture meant instant deportation, so on sight of the police they fled into the upland pine forests and cacti. After a few days they would fan north and try to melt into the economies of Spain and northern Europe. </p> <p>This summer something has changed. Thousands of sub-Saharan Africans have started following the Moroccans into overloaded dinghies for the two-hour moonlit ride. Staggering ashore are asylum seekers and immigrants from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Senegal. </p> <p>Unlike the Moroccans they do not run. They sit, or collapse, on the beach or motorway and wait to be picked up. </p> <p>Police around the town of Tarifa, Spain's southernmost tip, have intercepted more than 600 people in the past 10 days alone - an unprecedented rate of entry which shows no sign of slowing. </p> <p>The infrastructure to receive them is crumbling. A sports stadium is being used to supplement overflowing police cells. Stocks of shoes and clothes are running out. The arrivals are processed en masse rather than individually. The explanation is simple: Fortress Europe has shut one door, so the illegals are using another. </p> <p>Prompted by its European Union partners, Spain has sealed off Ceuta and Melilla, its two enclaves on the Moroccan coast which for years attracted sub-Saharans fleeing poverty and oppression. </p> <p>New fences ringed with razor wires, infra-red cameras and police patrols redirect the sub-Saharan traffic into the 12-mile Gibraltar strait. </p> <p>The strait is so narrow that car headlights can be seen on the other side, but treacherous currents and winds have claimed an estimated 3,000 lives in the past five years. </p> <p>\"After all we'd been through, we discovered we'd have to take another boat. It was almost too much,\" said Kisley Osas, 22, from Nigeria. </p> <p>With 26 other young men from his village, on June 28 he attached a motor to a fishing boat and started rowing. \"If you saw our lives there you'd understand why. We have nothing,\" he said. </p> <p>Using tyre tubes and air-filled plastic bottles as life-jackets, they stayed within sight of land and took turns rowing. They had hoped to avoid the Gibraltar crossing. </p> <p>\"About halfway across a wave from a tanker or something hit us. We were praying to God. Then a boat with white men in uniform came,\" he said. </p> <p>Maria, 25, and her three-month-old daughter were picked up last week, eight months after she left her Nigerian village to trek across the Sahara. The birth of her daughter, she said, was not easy. \"No professionals, no medicines.\" </p> <p>Other survivors tell of women dying in childbirth, and of companions dying of thirst and disease. Women are routinely raped by bandits and border guards, they say. </p> <p>With their livelihood threatened by civil guard naval patrols, the smugglers have raised the price of the crossing to \u00a31,000. The higher stakes have increased the temptation to overload the inflatable speedboats, called Zodiacs. </p> <p>The smugglers wait for calm weather, then race across in convoys of four or five to overwhelm the civil guards. Their \"clients\" are tossed overboard if a patrol boat approaches. </p> <p>A new route that has opened this summer is the unguarded 60-mile stretch to the Canaries, where surfers have watched as the boatloads of human cargo struggled to shore. </p> <p>The smugglers' tactics will have to become more ingenious - or brutal - in 2004, when Spain finishes installing an \u00a380m radar system that will form a 350-mile electronic wall across the Mediterranean. It will be able to detect boats at distances of up to seven miles. </p> <p>An underground network of activists has begun helping the new arrivals to elude police. They risk arrest but have the support of some civil guards. </p> <p>Other officers could be bribed, said a restaurant owner in the port city of Algeciras. As he spoke two officers entered and a table of four Moroccans froze. They stopped talking while the officers ordered coffee. Ten minutes later the officers left and the Moroccans exchanged tense smiles. \"If you look clean and well-dressed it tends to be OK,\" the owner said. </p> <p>At the weekend the Catholic church echoed human rights activists, saying that the government's policy was incoherent and irresponsible. </p> <p>A shrinking population and economic boom suggest that Spain will need 12m immigrants over the next 30 years. Farms and industry are crying out for labour. </p> <p>But conservative lobbying and fears of a voter backlash have prompted the government to crack down. Under a law due to be passed in the autumn it will become harder for immigrants to become legal, and it will be easier to expel them. </p> <p>This would make the traffic more expensive and dangerous, the church said, condemning the decision to seal off Ceuta and Melilla, which have orientation centres. </p> <p>\"It's tragic and stupid. No matter how many radars, police and boats we put on the beaches, these people will still come. The sooner Europe understands that the better,\" said Juan Maria Perez, an immigrant group coordinator. </p> <p>At the moment, the new arrivals are taken to Algeciras, fingerprinted, given new clothes and ordered to leave within two weeks. Then they are dumped on the street. </p> <p>They cluster around telephone boxes and the bus station, plotting to head north. Some ask the way to Italy, others have mobile phones, maps and contacts in Madrid. </p> <p>After rowing thousands of miles, Kisley Osas was not going to allow a lack of cash stop him getting a bus to Madrid last night. \"I'm going - just watch,\" he said.</p>",
  "US law enforcement officials have declared victory against an international drug-trafficking operation after a two-year effort ended in 43 arrests and the seizure of nearly 25 tonnes of cocaine worth an estimated $1bn (\u00a3670m). <p>Ivan de la Vega, the alleged leader of a smuggling ring that is believed to have shipped almost $3bn of cocaine around the world, and four others are to face drug-trafficking charges in Florida after a multinational law enforcement operation ended with a series of confrontations worthy of a Hollywood movie.</p> <p>Speedboat gun battles, jungle raids and the seizure of a freighter marked the last days of an effort to crack down on a Colombian drugs operation which used a remote location in Venezuela and the global shipping industry to transport cocaine to Europe and the US.</p> <p>In announcing the successful conclusion of Operation Journey on Saturday, Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the US customs service, said: \"We wiped out a sprawling organisation whose tentacles reached around the world.\"</p> <p>He described the organisation, allegedly run by Mr de la Vega from Colombia, as \"one of the largest drug transportation groups ever targeted by law enforcement\".</p> <p>The smuggling operation transported drugs from Colombia by way of the Venezuelan jungle to Europe using a fleet of up to 10 commercial freighters.</p> <p>Among those arrested in the international raids were understood to be several employees of the shipping industry in Europe.</p> <p>Eastern Europe has become more and more involved in drug trafficking since the fall of the Berlin wall in November 1989.</p> <p>US officials said the law-enforcement effort, which involved 12 countries, reflected the greater willingness of international agencies to work together to crack down on an increasingly global trade. Mr Kelly said in Washington that Operation Journey provided a \"powerful new blueprint for fighting the international drug trade\".</p> <p>There was particular praise for the Venezuelan authorities, who seized nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine in the country's sparsely populated Orinoco river delta last week. The largest haul in Venezuelan history is expected to help ease tensions between the country and Washington, which arose when Venezuela refused to allow American planes to use its airspace to fight the drug war.</p> <p>The end of the operation comes at a sensitive time for relations between several Latin America countries and their powerful neighbour. President Bill Clinton is due to arrive in Colombia on Wednesday to meet President Andres Pastrana. Last week, Mr Clinton authorised a $1.3bn aid package to help fight drug trafficking.</p> <p>Among the five facing prosecution in Florida is Luis Antonio Navia, a Cuban fugitive facing previous US drug charges. Others were arrested in Greece, Italy and France, and the operation saw the involvement of security forces in the UK, Albania, Belgium, the Netherlands and Panama.</p> <p>The Drugs Enforcement Administration said that it would continue to work with international agencies to end drug trafficking. Donnie Marshall at the DEA said yesterday: \"Operation Journey is only the beginning.\"</p>",
  "UN aid workers have warned that heavy fighting in Afghanistan is hampering efforts to help up to 4m people who have been seriously affected by the country's worst drought in 30 years. <p>Roads into some of the worst hit areas pass through military frontlines and are heavily mined or blocked. </p> <p>Last week the World Food Programme made the first delivery of 400 tonnes of wheat and seven tonnes of other food to Dara-e-Souf, near Samangan in the north. Children in the area are severely malnourished and some are eating roots and wild plants to survive. </p> <p>The worsening conditions may force 100,000 people in the area from their homes and create a food crisis by the winter, said Michael Semple, the UN coordinator for the region. </p> <p>Deliveries of another 15,000 tonnes of food needed in Dara-e-Souf will not get through unless roads are opened, he said. \"If they open roads a famine will not happen.\" </p> <p>The road used by the convoy is heavily mined and will be come blocked by heavy winter snow within three months. </p> <p>\"The problem will become acute when it becomes cold. People are waiting for a good winter rain. Otherwise the scale of disaster would be tough,\" Mr Semple said. </p> <p>The severe drought covers a broad stretch of land from western Pakistan through Afghanistan into Iran and north into central Asia. </p> <p>Crops across Afghanistan have been destroyed and nomadic herders have lost their animals. At least 2.3m tonnes of extra food will be needed in the country this year to make up for the effects of the drought, according to the UN. Refugees are expected to flood into neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. </p> <p>The problem in Afghanistan is being complicated by a new outbreak of heavy fighting between the Islamic Taliban militia, who control most of the country, and forces from the ousted government. </p> <p>Dara-e-Souf is still held by former government fighters who have held out against the Taliban for four years. </p> <p>\"The area was badly affected by the drought and by the war and it was a cross-line operation,\" said Mr Semple. \"On one side was the Taliban and on the other the opposition.\" </p> <p>In the past month the Taliban, a movement of religious students who seized Kabul in 1996, has led an offensive into the north, taking new ground and closing in on Taloqan, the administrative headquarters of the ousted government. </p> <p>The Taliban's reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, said the drought was divine punishment for those who were not praying regularly and who failed to support the Islamic regime. </p> <p>Alongside its latest military offensive, the Taliban has launched a new campaign to demand international recognition for its regime and prevent further sanctions. </p> <p>Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recognise the Taliban, while the ousted government still holds the country's seat at the UN in New York. </p> <p>\"Have mercy on the people of Afghanistan and give the United Nations seat to the true representatives of the people of Afghanistan whom the people like and support,\" the Taliban ambassador to Islamabad, Maulvi Mohammad Saeed Haqqani, said last week. </p> <p>\"Do not impose sanctions and bring more miseries for the people of Afghanistan.\" </p> <p>The UN security council imposed financial and aviation sanctions on the Taliban regime in November and has threatened to introduce an arms embargo unless the latest round of fighting stops. </p> <p>But a report from the UN office which provides aid in the country has warned that Afghanistan is too vulnerable to face economic sanctions, and that most people are already surviving at near subsistence levels.</p>",
  "This weekend, thousands of people will have been strolling over the heaths of Dorset and the New Forest, admiring the rare heather, birds - such as the Dartford warbler - insects and reptiles for whom such heathland is their only habitat. But it is unlikely that many will understand the vulnerability of such pockets of England's natural heritage. <p>Over the last 100 years, England has lost 80% of its lowland heaths. The system of sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) has protected rare habitats like these which have managed to survive being covered over with concrete and tarmac. But it never had the powers to ensure the sites were managed properly. In terms of conservation, SSSIs were never more than a half-way house, failing to prevent neglect and damage from intensive agriculture. Heathlands become woods unless they are regularly grazed, mown or burnt. This loophole risked making a mockery of the attempt at conservation of British wildlife. That is why bodies such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have campaigned for over a decade for tougher legislation. </p> <p>Now concern is growing that the countryside and rights of way bill, which was to deliver Labour's manifesto plans for protecting wildlife, is in danger. It is caught in a logjam of nearly 30 bills going through parliament and the fear is that it could get bogged down in debate over the 300-odd amendments tabled - many by landowning Conservatives concerned at right-to-roam measures. Conservationists are also worried that the government might axe the bill to slim the parliamentary agenda. </p> <p>This made the government's announcement proposing 80 sites for European protection as special areas of conservation (SACs) so important. Under this tough European directive, SSSIs get the kind of protection and duty to manage that they need. Being an SSSI did not protect the Hatfield moors from peat extraction, but being an SAC will. Until the countryside and rights of way bill is passed, our wildlife is better protected by European legislation.</p>",
  "You state (Motorists face 25% rise in insurance, August 23) that this increase was partly due to \"the Ogden and Woolf changes - the Law Commission's recommendation, made last year ... which means victims of car crashes can now claim for future care costs and potential loss of earnings\". <p>In fact, victims of all accidents (including car crashes) have always been able to claim for future care and loss of earnings.

The upshot is an increase in some awards for future care and loss of earnings.

  "In January 1967, when the Bahamas was still a British colony, the black population of Nassau, New Providence, and of the other 700 or so islands of the far-flung archipelago, danced with delight as the news seeped through of a famous election victory. By a whisker, black majority rule had arrived. <p>The stranglehold on power of the entrenched white elite, the so-called \"Bay Street Boys\" (named after Nassau's main business street), had been broken. For three centuries, they had dominated commercial and political life, and had been the mainstay of the \"colour bar\" that controlled most areas of Bahamian life. </p> <p>The man responsible for this historic electoral win was Sir Lynden Pindling, leader of the Bahamas for 25 years - both before and after its independence in 1973 - known as \"Black Moses\", who has died aged 70. Always ready to use robust language to denounce first, British colonialism, and later, American imperialism as the political occasion demanded, he deployed his considerable charm to court British, European and American investment and business activity. </p> <p>Most Bahamians overlooked his dictatorial manner (often accompanied by intense staring through a slow eye) and questionable business deals, as he transformed the prospects of his fellow blacks. By the time he was voted out of office, in 1992, GNP per capita was $12,000, second only to the Caymans in the English-speaking Caribbean. </p> <p>The son of a retired policeman, he did well enough at school to go to London university, from where he graduated with a law degree in 1952. He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in early 1953 and to the Bahamian Bar in the following August. On his return home, he joined the minority black-led Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), which had been only recently formed. </p> <p>He was elected to the House of Assembly in 1956 on a limited franchise and unremittingly campaigned for universal suffrage, always delayed by the white elite. Male universal suffrage was conceded in 1962, when older women also got the vote. </p> <p>Contrary to expectations, the United Bahamian Party (UBP), which had been created by the white elite to counter the PLP, won the 1962 elections, although the PLP polled a majority of votes. Crisis gripped the PLP leadership and Pindling became leader soon after. His platform was to insist on constitutional advancement, and universal suffrage for both sexes came in 1964. Despite growing prosperity, the British government reserved considerable powers to itself, and this provided a further target for Pindling. </p> <p>At the 1967 election, he switched his electoral base from New Providence to Kemp's Bay, Andros Island, where accusations of corruption against members of the UBP, vigorous PLP campaigning and support from the sole representative of the Negro Labour Party resulted in Pindling becoming premier. Shock waves rippled through the Bahamas. Racial strife and economic collapse were predicted. In fact, the white elite soon learned they could live with a PLP government, which was similarly interested in promoting business, tourism and offshore finance. </p> <p>Almost at once, Pindling insisted on constitutional change: the Assembly was dissolved and an election called in 1968 to ensure a mandate for change, which returned the PLP to power. Independence followed five years later. Thereafter, Pindling led the PLP to win five successive elections. The UBP collapsed and it took years of confusion before the Free National Movement (FNM) eventually emerged as the opposition party. Pindling paid particular attention to immigration, in the hope that black Bahamians would benefit. Yet successive clampdowns on illegal Haitian immigrants and strict work permit rules for (mainly white) expatriates had unforeseen effects. Wages rose, but not in line with skills. </p> <p> Despite impressive industrial and other development, notably at Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, black (especially youth) unemployment stubbornly remained and investment was often being directed at capital-intensive rather than labour-intensive projects. </p> <p>By the late 1970s, the Bahamas had become associated with drug trafficking and money laundering, being en route between south America and the United States. The FNM eventually focused on narcotic-related corruption in the PLP ministerial ranks. In 1983 - the year he was knighted - Pindling was accused in a US television programme of involvement in drug trafficking and was forced to launch a royal commission to investigate the claims against himself and the PLP. The commission found against several ministers but Pindling was cleared, although the report noted that his expenditure was eight times his declared income. </p> <p>Confronted by an angry US government which threatened sanctions against the Bahamas, Pindling had to grant US law enforcement officials diplomatic immunity and free passage through the archipelago, plus access to the criminal secrets of offshore banks. </p> <p>Gradually, the offshore industry was cleaned up. In 1985 a joint US-Bahamian operation in Bimini netted an incredible 34,000 tonnes of marijuana and 2,500 tonnes of processed cocaine . </p> <p>Pindling sought political vengeance for his humiliation. The FNM opposition had urged cooperation with Washington. In the 1987 election campaign, he played both nationalist and racial cards to good effect. His opponents, he said, were traitors, concerned only to appease US and white interests and to degrade the black populace. The FNM was trounced and its leadership demoralised. But change was in the air. Former PLP minister Hubert Ingraham emerged as FNM leader and his party's image became more black-orientated. </p> <p>By the early 1990s, the black population in New Providence in particular was severely affected by recession; then another scandal broke over the state-owned airline, Bahamasair, and the Pindling-headed Bahamas Hotel Corporation. In the 1992 election, the PLP was decisively defeated. </p> <p>As leader of the opposition, Pindling fought a long rearguard action against inquiries involving his business affairs. Despite his legal difficulties, he gained comfort from the knowledge that the political magic associated with \"Black Moses\" remained very much alive. His offer to resign after the 1992 election was refused by the PLP rank and file, who revered him to the end. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Marguerite McKenzie of Andros, and by his two sons and two daughters. </p> <p><b>Sir Lynden Oscar Pindling, politician, born March 22 1930; died August 26 2000</b></p>",
  "Henry Wilfred \"Bunny\" Austin, the most admirable failure in the history of British tennis, has died on his 94th birthday. Though in age he had hoped that Tim Henman might replace him, he still remained the last male British competitor to reach the finals at Wimbledon. Fred Perry won (for the third year running) in 1936; Austin lost in 1932 and 1938. At least he got there, and twice. He was also the man who introduced shorts to the game. <p>Austin enjoyed an idyllic middle-class childhood before the first world war. He lived with his parents and sister Phyllis in a large house with servants in South Norwood. He was nicknamed Bunny after a rabbit in a comic-strip called Wilfred. So keen was his father (whose own nickname was Wolf), that his son should become a sportsman that he seized the newborn infant from the doctor to check that his limbs were sound. Bunny accommodated these expectations at the earliest possible moment: he practised hitting tennis balls against his nursery wall, and joined Norhurst Tennis Club at the age of six. </p> <p>At Repton School, he played for the cricket team, but tennis was his passion, and in 1921 he won the under-16 singles in the public schoolboys' tournament at Queen's. The following year he won the junior championships in the singles, doubles and mixed doubles, and in 1923 again won singles and doubles in the public schoolboys' tournament. </p> <p>He had similar successes in 1924 and 1925: he representing England against America at Eastbourne, winning the Cambridge university singles, and reaching the men's doubles semi-finals in his first year at Wimbledon in 1926, all while still an undergraduate. Altogether, Austin reached the Wimbledon quarter- finals, or beyond, 10 times. Unseeded in 1929, he reached the semi-finals, losing to Jean Borotra of France. He was ranked ninth in the world by the year's end, and was seeded sixth at Wimbledon for the following three years. </p> <p> In 1932, Austin, aged 25, dropped just three sets en route to his first finals - he was the first Englishman to reach them for a decade - only to be overwhelmed by the American Ellsworth Vines in three sets. Sixty-six years later, as a generous-minded and gracious nonagenarian, he recalled this defeat for the Guardian's Frank Keating in the nursing-home where he spent his last years: \"Ellsworth wiped me off the court in 50 minutes. I was annihilated. It was 6-4, 6-2, 6-0 and he won the match with an ace.\" </p> <p>Austin bounced back in 1933, was seeded fourth and reached the quarter-final, going out to Japan's Jiro Satoh. As Austin recalled: \"It was the year I invented shorts. I found sweat-sodden cricket flannels were weighing me down, so my tailor ran up some prototype shorts.\" He also had his revenge on Vines, beating him 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 in Paris in the Davis Cup zone final. He and Fred Perry were national heroes, carried shoulder-high by cheering crowds on their return to Victoria Station. </p> <p>Austin was used to such celebrity. In 1931 he had married actress Phyllis Konstam. She is now remembered only by a few avid Hitchcock film buffs, for roles in his 1928 silent comedy Champagne, his early, stodgy British talkie The Skin Game and his 1930 film, Murder. At the time, Konstam was feted and beautiful, Austin was a pin-up, and theirs was a celebrity wedding of 1931. They had met on a Cunard liner two years earlier as Austin was heading for the US Open at Forest Hills (in which he reached the last eight). </p> <p>This gilded couple knew a galaxy of famous people; Bunny was a friend of Daphne du Maurier, Ronald Coleman and Michael, King of Romania, and he played tennis socially with Charlie Chaplin and the Queen of Thailand. (He found himself shouting \"Run, your Majesty, run!\" when they played doubles.) He met Queen Mary and President Roosevelt, and the future President Kennedy told him he had been a fan. The tennis ace Suzanne Lenglen insisted he play doubles with her. </p> <p> At Wimbledon, Bunny's mixed doubles partners were Betty Nuthall and Joan Lycett, and, in 1934, Dorothy Shepherd Barron, with whom he reached the finals (a 0-6 third set defeat). In the men's doubles he never played again after his second round defeat of 1931, partnered by Charles Kingsley. </p> <p> In the singles, however, he reached the quarter-finals year after year, peaking in 1935 with a respectable four-set defeat by Donald Budge, one of the game's all-time greats. It would be the longest Wimbledon singles match Budge ever played. That year, Austin was a semi-finalist in the French Championship and defeated Budge and Allison in the challenge round of the Davis Cup, which he and Perry were instrumental in retaining for Britain. </p> <p>Seeded seventh, Bunny reached the semi-finals once again in 1936, going out to the German von Cramm, and the following year, now the British No 1, he repeated this result against the same opponent. He also reached the finals of the French. </p> <p>In 1938 he met Budge again, this time in the Wimbledon final. He won only four games. \"Donald was unstoppable that afternoon,\" Austin remembered half a century on - adding, characteristically: \"He was a true great. It was an honour just to be on the same court.\" The following year was Austin's last as a Wimbledon competitor. Seeded No 1, he went out to the American sixth seed Elwood Cooke in straight sets, after beating future champion (and future Briton) Jaroslav Drobny in round three. </p> <p>It was not the end of the story. Despite their celebrity and famous friends, Bunny and Phyllis had been drawn toward the Oxford Group and Moral Rearmament, and worked for this cause from the early 1930s; during the war, they went to America to promote it. Peter Ustinov, who knew Austin, wrote that he was \"disgracefully ostracised by the All-England Club because he was a conscientious objector\". Austin had been a Club member since 1925, yet on his return to Britain in 1961, he was told his membership had \"been lapsed\". They restored it when he was 77 years old; Austin noted: \"In 1984, 40 years after getting rid of me, they suddenly let me back in and [were] all very nice to me.\" </p> <p>Austin, whose autobiography A Mixed Double was published in 1969, and his wife devoted the rest of their lives to Moral Rearmament, travelling the world to promote the cause. They were particularly involved in the MRA's Westminster Theatre, where a production about their life, Love All, was staged. </p> <p>Phyllis died in 1976. In 1995, Austin had a serious fall, and entered a nursing home at Coulsdon, Surrey, where he remained, sociable, alert, unembittered and interested in life and in tennis. He is survived by a daughter, Jennifer, and son, John. </p> <p><b>Henry Wilfred \"Bunny\" Austin, tennis player, born August 26, 1906; died August 26 2000</b></p>",
  "<p>English football is going backwards. This summer no great player has signed for an English club and there are no new big stars. Where is the new Eric Cantona, Dennis Bergkamp, Gianfranco Zola or David Ginola? Thanks to them, English football improved, but now Cantona is gone and the others - who remain the big attractions in England - are old. If English football wants to improve again it needs players of quality at their peak. A young Bergkamp, not a thirtysomething Boksic. </p> <p>Redondo and Veron prefer to play in the South of Europe not only because the food and the weather are more appealing. The Premiership has become less attractive than before because it is standing still. What is more, if you want to attract young technical players you must protect them. </p> <p>To focus on Patrick Vieira is to avoid talking about the real problems of refereeing in England. In my opinion, it is the poorest in Europe because it is so inconsistent. I've watched some games where the referee is in control and talks a lot to the players, and others where there is no sensitivity and a lot of rash bookings. You can understand the players' frustration when somebody is punished for an innocuous challenge and the next day on television you see a dangerous tackle and the referee waves play on. Roy Keane was sent off in the Charity Shield for a terrible tackle, but I have seen that kind of thing go unpunished before in English football. I remember when Ian Wright could have broken Peter Schmeichel's leg with a moment of pure aggression but stayed on the field. </p> <p> Sometimes I'm horrified when I see the brutal tackles that litter the Premiership. They are impossible in France, Spain or Italy. Football is too violent in England, but it is part of the culture. The crowd like men who fight, who try to win the ball with physical intensity, and fans applaud a great tackle - a reaction that doesn't exist in Mediterranean leagues. But the problem is that when it is done by a British player it is a fantastic challenge, yet when it is Vieira or Hamann it is a reckless foul. </p> <p>Feeling victimised by referees was not the only reason Emmanuel Petit left the Premiership, but when you watch matches in Spain you see players can actually play football. They can pass, move, run, dribble. Look at Valencia, Barcelona and Real Madrid in last season's Champions League. Technicians like Raul, Redondo, Mendieta and Figo are fantastic players who have the space and atmosphere to play football without a fight. David Beckham would improve if he played in Spain because he would have more freedom. </p> <p>Sometimes players get tired of fighting. Vieira is a great player and it's normal for lesser players to provoke him, but in fairness he has to learn to stop using his elbows. He can avoid that. Raul, for example, has his shirt pulled regularly but he manages to wait for the free-kick rather than react. Vieira is not a perfect French angel, but he is not a hooligan. If you know him he is a well-balanced, kind man. The shame is that he really loves English football - but six red cards in four years? </p> <p>I expect he will stay this season because he won't abandon Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, but in the summer he might feel the time is right to leave. Every big club in Italy wants him. It would be detrimental to English football if he left. You would end up with games contested by British players and bad Europeans. A drain of premium talent, coupled with the unimpressive state of the national team, means England is at least five years behind the top echelons of European football.</p>",
  "<p>New season, new optimism. But it seems the same old story is never far away at Goodison Park. Two goals to the good after a first half of outstanding skill and creativity, Walter Smith's Everton let it slip in dismal fashion as defensive lapses and sloppy passing allowed Derby County the draw they scarcely deserved. </p> <p>It looked so good for Everton at half time, as Smith's new signings - Niclas Alexandersson, Alex Nyarko and most notably, Thomas Gravesen - led the visitors a merry dance. </p> <p>Maybe the prospect of winning successive home games at a canter, following Wednesday night's 3-0 demolition of Charlton, injected a dose of nerves into Everton's play, but the result was the sort of collapse that has been all too common with the Blues in recent seasons. </p> <p>The rot kicked in after 51 minutes when substitutes Stefan Schnoor and Dean Sturridge combined to unlock Everton's defence. Full-back Steve Watson mistimed his challenge on Schnoor and, when the ball was played into the box, Sturridge gratefully accepted the chance. </p> <p>The fightback was complete 15 minutes later when Derby's Belgian international striker Branco Strupar showed himself for the first time in the afternoon with a free-kick outside the box. </p> <p>Everton defender David Unsworth conceded the foul with a poor challenge on Deon Burton, and Strupar stepped up to deliver a shot from the free-kick that blazed a trail through Everton's defence and left goalkeeper Paul Gerrard little chance. </p> <p>Afterwards Smith was understandably disappointed. 'We handed the initiative to Derby in the second half, which was a real shame because we were in control up until half time,' he said. 'Derby fought back well and they deserved to come back into the game because of the amount of commitment they showed. They were the better side in the second half.' </p> <p>Smith had started without Wednesday's two-goal hero, Duncan Ferguson, out with yet another injury, while fellow new boy Paul Gascoigne was relegated to the bench in a bid to taper his reintroduction to the harsh realities of Premiership football. </p> <p>But the first half proved life without the pair is not all that bad. Not bad at all. Everton sprang to life after a quarter of an hour with four chances in less than five minutes. </p> <p>Mark Hughes fired narrowly wide after Alexandersson had ripped apart Derby's marking on the right wing to deliver a dangerous, low cross. American striker Joe-Max Moore was equally effective cutting a swathe through the visiting side's back line, but goalkeeper Mart Poom turned the ball around the post. </p> <p>Everton kept up the pressure and were dominant in midfield. The reward for their effort was spectacular, with two goals inside as many minutes at the game ticked towards half time. First, young striker Francis Jeffers side-footed home with great aplomb after Moore slipped the ball into his path at the second attempt. </p> <p>Goodison was still celebrating when Danish midfielder Gravesen broke through Derby's static defence to latch on to Stephen Hughes's intelligent through ball. Poom got a finger to Gravesen's shot but it was insufficient to divert it from the bottom right hand corner of his goal.</p>",
  "<p>Cricket is hardly the most lucrative of sports, and individual rewards traditionally go into a team 'pool'. But yesterday at Lord's a young bowler had the chance to pocket \u00a35,000 - and blew it. </p> <p>Matthew Whiley, a 20-year-old whose Nottinghamshire appearances have been mostly for the second XI, was one of a group of young fast bowlers competing for the money put up by Freeserve, the sponsors of the speed gun used at all major matches. With rain dominating outside, the young tearaways stretched themselves to the limit on the smooth surface of the indoor cricket school. </p> <p>One of those competing was Yorkshire's Matthew Hoggard, who made his Test debut here, but at the end of the preliminary round the best reading was 84.1mph by the little-known Whiley, a heftily-built left-armer. After a rest, the best six bowlers delivered the decisive three balls. Hoggard now went ahead with 86.2mph. Then, with a drama that echoed an Olympic long-jump final, Whiley's last delivery registered 86.5 - but he was no-balled. It was agonisingly close. A mere half-inch beyond the line had deprived him of \u00a35,000. </p> <p>In the best traditions of the Big Loser, Whiley said: 'I came here with nothing so I've lost nothing.' </p> <p>Hoggard received his big cheque from team-mate Darren Gough, who stands to win an even bigger sum - \u00a310,000 - for the fastest ball of the summer. There has been no serious challenge to the 93.2mph he recorded in the summer's first Test, against Zimbabwe. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>Being hand-made, cricket balls vary more than balls in any other sport. And unlike, say, tennis or football, it's not the same for both sides: the variability can dramatically benefit one team at the other's expense. It seems astonishing, then, that professional cricket has been so lax in checking and monitoring balls - though that could be about to change. </p> <p>The catalyst may be the recent discovery that many Dukes balls were lighter than the permitted weight tolerances - arguably making them swing more - while some Readers balls were overweight. Clearly, the twice-a-year checks by the British Standards Institution are inadequate for this type of product. Surely that is where the umpires should come in. At present, the most they will do is check for size with two ring gauges. </p> <p>Many counties select their season's supply at the maker's factory, and the whim of bowlers seems to dictate. It is from that selection that, before each innings of a county match, the fielding side choose their ball. At long last, all this is starting to worry the England Cricket Board, who recognise that 'manufacturers are encouraged to produce a ball that bowlers like'. </p> <p>John Carr, of the ECB, says: 'We have a problem that we must address. It may well be that all balls for county cricket will have to come through the ECB offices and be checked by us.' That would certainly be a professional move. </p> <p>'Do Channel 4 producers ever read this stuff?' So asks a plaintive message, one of many placed on the cricket4.com website. Probably not, is the answer. Channel 4's cricket is delivered by a production company, Sunset+Vine, whose boss was last week unaware of a stream of messages supporting a 'Bring Back Sensible Cricket Highlights Campaign'. </p> <p>The accessible channel deserves credit for displaying viewers' opinions, many of which are supportive. But no topic, not even the switches from cricket to racing has generated such concerted criticism as the highlights programme. </p> <p>Viewers say that a 30-minute slot at 7.30pm is too short and too early, and they're particularly irked by time being taken up by this summer's 'arty', mannered introductions to the programme. Trying to catch up on the day's play, the campaigners say they just want lots of great shots and wickets - the 'People's Highlights' as one of them says. </p> <p>When contacted last week, Sunset+Vine's managing director, Jeff Foulser, was unaware of the comments on cricket4 and rather scornful of the term 'campaign'. He concedes that 'maybe we have been a bit ambitious', but argues that the highlights have to be more entertaining to draw an audience that will justify the early evening slot. 'Last year the highlights didn't rate very high. This year they've gone up a bit.' As for the ECB, their marketing director, Terry Blake, says this year the highlights have been 'really amazing - the old format was not the way forward'. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>There is no doubt that Colwyn Bay is a small ground. There were 20 sixes there last week as the Glamorgan v Sussex game generated 1,376 runs. However, the 1,354 runs at Leicester included only five sixes. Such statistics should make it clear that it is difficult to defend such small boundaries as Colwyn Bay's. Yet the game continues to sustain the perverse notion that big grounds like the Oval and Bristol are 'hard to defend'. Nonsense. They may see many twos and threes, but that just means fewer fours and sixes.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Cole sounded more like a schoolboy autograph hunter than a potential England player. \"I hope I haven't got David into trouble,\" he said after persuading David Beckham to smuggle out his shirt. It will hang on Cole's wall, perhaps beside Posh Spice's new single.</p> <p>If that was an endearing reminder that the hero-worshipped midfielder has football idols like any other teenager, his performance for West Ham confirmed he is no ordinary 18-year-old. Kevin Keegan would surely love it if Cole and Beckham were in his side soon.</p> <p>The pair were, together with Paolo di Canio, the game's outstanding performers. After Beckham's brilliant free-kick and perceptive long pass had helped Manchester United to a 2-0 lead, Cole was instrumental in West Ham's deserved late comeback. He made a darting run that earned a penalty and then figured prominently in the move that led to Davor Suker's equaliser.</p> <p>If it is players who can control a ball and keep possession that Keegan is after, he will hope Cole continues in this vein. Operating from his favourite position behind the front two, he was all quick feet, neat vision, impressive acceleration and balance. West Ham's manager Harry Redknapp compared him afterwards to Paul Gascoigne - the one of 10 years ago, that is - but Cole is by no means the finished article. He is so slight he could probably use even the new Gazza's shirt as a tent. As Sir Alex Ferguson said: \"He's got to mature physically and through that he will become a better player.\"</p> <p>Before Keegan calls up Cole he needs to play more regularly for West Ham too. This was his first start since he broke a leg in April and, since his Premiership debut 19 months ago, he has started no more than eight league matches in a row. Not that anyone would guess from the hype about him almost since he came out of nappies.</p> <p>When Cole signed a contract on the pitch here before a match against Chelsea a little under two years ago the Tannoy man proclaimed: \"You can tell your grandchildren you were there when Joe Cole signed for West Ham.\" The expectation every match is huge. \"He's still a boy of 18 and some people forget that,\" Redknapp said. \"He's our Great White Hope but he's got to get in West Ham's side on a regular basis and start scoring 10 to 12 goals a season if he's going to fulfil his potential. Everyone saw his quality with the way he surged into the penalty area leaving players for dead. I haven't seen that in anyone since Gazza. But he still has a lot to learn and he must keep his feet on the ground.\"</p> <p>Cole's words afterwards told of self-confidence but not of arrogance. He said he was no longer \"in awe\" of Beckham and Paul Scholes, and nor should he be. The surge that was halted by Henning Berg, allowing Di Canio to score from the spot, showed a rare talent. Three minutes later he released Di Canio, whose cross was sliced by Mikael Silvestre and forced in by Suker's head.</p> <p>It was the least West Ham deserved after dominating and, as is their wont, wasting chances. Ferguson did not begrudge them their first point after his side's patchy show and unusually human collapse. \"We took our foot off the gas and were punished for it,\" he said.</p> <p>The champions had looked vulnerable all afternoon, with Silvestre a liability at left-back and later at centre-half. Yet they still seemed set for victory when Beckham, who had curled in an early 25-yard free-kick, sent Ryan Giggs clear and Andrew Cole - playing alongside Teddy Sheringham in the absence of Dwight Yorke, who Ferguson confirmed had a toe injury - took a rare opportunity. West Ham's enthusiasm and attacking verve earned them the draw, albeit after Beckham twice hit woodwork in injury-time.</p> <p>\"This is the best team I've had at West Ham,\" Redknapp said. The table suggests as much only if looked at upside down but another teenage midfielder, Michael Carrick, looked assured and Redknapp said he turned down a \u00a310m offer for the injured Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanoute last week.</p> <p>Injuries make Gary Neville (groin) and Rio Ferdinand (hip) doubtful for England's game in Paris on Saturday. It should not be long before England fans are worrying about the fitness of Joe Cole before internationals as well.</p>",
  "<p>If you ever doubted the merits of European integration go and get a visa for your non-EC national spouse at any EC embassy. You'll find it a small piece of bureaucratic holiday pre-history perfectly preserved. If you're under 40 you won't even remember that it used to be like this to go on holiday anywhere - the long queues, the raffle tickets, the security man who treats you like a criminal for wanting to visit his country, the assumption that somehow you must be undesirable if you have to subject yourself to this process. </p> <p>The offices are always in a dark windowless basement. There is always security glass (as if there was any point in stealing a visa) and there is always an officious official, generally female, walking around with a clipboard. They want your bank statements, your marriage certificates, a letter from your employer and a solemn promise that you won't like their country enough to actually stay there. All the time you want to scream: 'We're only going on holiday.' But you can't because the man has a rubber stamp marked 'denied' and being grumpy might be a reason for using it. </p> <p>For me and my wife though, the Italian consulate will always stand out as the only place where our actual choice of destination was questioned. 'Ischia? Why on earth do you want to go there?' said the man behind the counter, whose blue shirt and crumpled monotone tie were the height of bureaucrat chic. We couldn't work out why he would say it, though after two hours at the consulate it was a question we were starting to ask ourselves. If good things come to those who wait, Ischia would have to be paradise. </p> <p>The island of Ischia sits in the middle of the bay of Naples, a 30-minute boat ride from the city, its holiday appeal apparently rendered invisible by the wealth and fame of nearby Capri and the overcrowded resort draw of Sorrento. The island has been treated as Capri's supposedly ugly sister for two millennia, in 29BC the Roman emperor Augustus swapped Ischia with the Greeks to get hold of Capri. The island has had an inferiority complex ever since, even to the extent of fostering a legend about an island next door where the women are incredibly beautiful. The women of Ischia are expected, presumably, to take this on their double chins. </p> <p> It takes as long to duck and dive through the smog and snarl-up of Naples to get to the boat for Ischia as does the journey from the port to Ischia itself. The journey is short enough that your companions are more likely to be commuters than tourists. But the island might as well be on another planet. When you arrive at Ischia Port, a volcanic lagoon fringed with green hills and a fishing-village picture-postcard sea-front, Naples feels 100 years away. They say you can see Naples from Ischia on a clear day. But who would bother looking? </p> <p>They, which I suppose means people who produce brochures, call Ischia the Green Island, historically because of the mineral content of the rocks, now because of the foliage that seems to cling to the volcanic summit and foothills that dominate the island. </p> <p>Ischia is small, only 47 square kilometres, and nearly half the 40,000 inhabitants live in the main town, simply called Ischia. Because of its size there are limits on the number of cars allowed on the island and restrictions on building which have stopped it turning into any kind of resort hell. Everything here feels up close and personal in the nicest sense (except perhaps the cliff edges on some of the winding roads). The two best hotels, Il Moresco and the Excelsior, are barely visible from behind trees and bushes - the lemon tree and Indian fig are trademarks of the island. There are cacti, exotic birds, fruits, trees hanging out of everyone's back garden, views from extinct volcanoes, seafood by the bucket, beaches, castles, history. So how has such a beautiful place remained relatively undiscovered? </p> <p>There have been people on Ischia since the Stone Age. It's been occupied by the Phoenicians, taken over by the Syracusans, claimed by Romans, overrun by wealthy refugees from Pompeii, attacked by the Vandals, Byzantines, Saracens and Normans, developed by the Emperor of Swabia (don't ask me where that was), routinely swapped between France and Spain, returned to Garibaldi's new Italy and occupied by the Germans between 1942 and 1945. The invading Tourists must have seemed harmless in comparison. </p> <p>Of course the real reason for its absence from most tourist radars is that the island is very small and those who got here first (the Germans again) have kept coming back. There wasn't room for many more until recently and so there was no need for Ischians to shout about the place. </p> <p>There are other reasons why it has escaped attention. It caters for the quieter crowd, which has tended to mean older and richer folk and tourists who don't like tourists. The word of mouth has probably been limited because the kind of people who like Ischia wouldn't want to tell everyone about it. Its appeal is genteel, lying less in the beaches, which are plentiful but of mixed quality, and more in the volcanic springs and heated mineral waters which hide beneath Ischia's volcanic rocks. All the best hotels have spas and for those of us who think heaven will be an eternally hot bath with a succession of books and newspapers and a constantly replenished glass of fine wine, Ischia can give you a strong hint of how pleasant eternity could be. Mobile phones only work sporadically here too. </p> <p>The island even produces its own wine, which is exclusively drunk there. The Pietratorcia (Flaming Rock) winery on the island is open to visitors and offers light lunch and a tour of the vineyard for a pittance. Don't let the kids ask what they're going to do with the luvvly bunny wabbits they keep in a stony underground hutch, though. They double as the local culinary speciality. </p> <p> You don't need to choose between the beach or the hot bath. The nearest Ischia comes to a resort is at the Poseidon Gardens, where the prettiest beach backs on to an outdoor spa and bath complex with differently styled pools supplied by the 12 local springs and varying in temperature from 26C to 40C (for those who aren't cooks or chemists, the temperature of a very hot bath). From the coastal road above it looks like a giant crazy-golf course. Poseidon gets quite crowded so we went to the Negombo, which is more to local tastes, smaller and one suspects the island's premier water-based al fresco shagging opportunity. </p> <p>All of Ischia reeks of understated unhurried good-living. In fact the only bold and dramatic thing about Ischia is its castle, which, if you saw The Talented Mr Ripley, you have already seen without knowing it. The fake coastal town of Mongibello in the film was a composite of a number of southern Italian towns, but the beach where Ripley and his prey meet and the town square with a huge island castle in the background is Ischia. The cast stayed at Il Moresco and loved it, though how Gwyneth Paltrow maintained her stick-like dignity with the overgenerous portions and five courses they serve up at lunch and dinner is a mystery to me. </p> <p>If you don't want to return home with unwelcome excess baggage on your gut then the castle does at the very least offer an opportunity for a brisk uphill walk. There is a lift (not an original feature), but the walk up the wide spiral passage that leads to the top is cool and invigorating with a couple of shrines and chapels for those who want to mask their exhaustion with fake religious fervour. </p> <p>The castle's history is typically rich. It was used as a refuge from pirates by local inhabitants and at one time was home to 5,000 people. Michelangelo is said to have designed a turret for Princess Vittoria Colonna. They claim Mona Lisa came from here. It boasted 13 churches and was a convent for the Poor Sisters of Clare. The word Poor hardly does justice to the miserable existence of the Sisters of Clare. The convent was made up of the unloved first-born daughters of wealthy folk and when they died, their bodies were not buried but sat in chairs to putrefy in the room where the nuns prayed. The remains were left to drain away through a hole in the chair into the rocks. Mortality rates were high, which I suppose, was the point. The chairs are still there. </p> <p>The only English intervention up to now in the history of the island was noisy and unhelpful - the Royal Navy bombarded the castle and destroyed part of it in 1809. Well, not quite the only intervention. The English composer Sir William Walton made a lasting, positive contribution to the island and remains the Ischians basic idea of what the English are like. Walton fell in love with the island and made his home here in 1949, creating a now beautiful garden from a lump of volcanic rock that the locals thought utterly barren. The venture was written off as a typically eccentric and hopeless piece of English bravado. Walton is no more, but his Argentinian wife Susana prowls the garden at La Mortella, now open to the public and containing at least 300 exotic plants from all sorts of places whose climate is nothing like Ischia, evangelising its beauty and the talents of its designer Russell Page. Go there in the morning or the late evening to avoid the busy times or go when Lady Walton has scheduled a recital. But definitely go. </p> <p>Perhaps as a thank you to Walton, Ischians are prepared to forget the bombardment and welcome the English back. The mainly middle-aged Germans are not coming in the numbers they were so there are vacancies which British travel agents are moving in on. The nightlife of Ischia is not sensational, your kids would get bored in less than 24 hours, but if you and your significant other want some peace and quiet and a do-nothing, feelgood fortnight away from home and work, the food, the hot spas, the beach and the sheer green tranquility of the place will send you to bed early anyway. And as for the man at the Italian embassy.

  "Consistency is a quality I neither possess nor particularly admire, but I'm a little abashed, to say the least, at the unexpected turn my life has recently taken. Here I am, embarked on an ill-considered project of selling the flat I've inhabited and worked in for 15 years, leaving London where I've always lived, and buying a house in the provinces - all, my dears, in wild pursuit of my heart's desire. In the first place, I don't do wild; and in the second, I don't have a heart. These, I would have said, were givens. I can still be heard to mutter testily that they remain so, as I instruct estate agents and fail to receive with good grace the amused congratulations of my friends, but I'm uncomfortably aware that I'm only trying to salvage a little self-respect. <p>The Poet and I have been love's middle-aged dream for 18 months now, and the 60 miles between Cambridge and London have become an insufferable distance. The more so given that Camden's resident parking policies mean that I am only allowed to have a lover who stays for four hours at a time. There are all-day parking permits, but residents are entitled to purchase no more than 10 of these a year. This interesting piece of social engineering seems to require marriage, or solitude, or brief and efficient sexual encounters for which the residents must pay Camden at a rate of 40p an hour for the first 40 hours, 80p for the second 40 hours, and \u00a31.20 an hour thereafter. This is acompetitive rate compared to the market price, I know, but being a child of the Sixties, I haven't quite managed to shake off the notion of free love. </p> <p>So when the house directly opposite the Poet came on the market (I haven't entirely lost my mind - I'm not actually going to live with him), I threw caution to the wind and decided to sell up. </p> <p>What has become clear in the past few weeks is how right I was to maintain that affairs of the heart should be secondary to keeping as emotionally still as possible. To start with, I have pitched myself into the half-lit moral desert of house-buying and -selling. One thing I know is that wanting anything badly makes a person vulnerable. A shrink once said to me that the problem was my refusal to make myself vulnerable (as in not making the necessary transference on to him), to which I replied that I couldn't for the life of me see how volunteering for vulnerability could be seen as a prerequisite for mental health. On the contrary, it is OK to want something, but not so much that it would upset your routine if you can't have it.</p> <p>If anything confirms the danger of desire, it is getting involved with estate agents who, like the most manipulative of lovers, gauge the degree of wanting and then employ maybe-you-can-maybe-you-can't games that propel you back and forth to the edges of hope and despair and make of you their plaything. A lover you can tell to get lost, but an estate agent selling the house across the road from your heart's desire is in sadomasochistic heaven when he tells you that your offer has not yet been firmly accepted and will not be unless you are prepared to put your finances and psyche on the line with inordinate bridging loans and inconvenient completion dates. If only I didn't want that particular house... if only I didn't want that particular house... if only I didn't want... I wake up sweating at three in the morning. Imagine, caught up in such helplessness at this late stage of my life. </p> <p>And in any case, what am I doing, all quiet and in control, free, independent, unbeholden, moving to a strange town on a draughty fen for a man? I know about men. But the Poet soothes me with talk of late-onset passion, of finding and keeping, of time running out. Not, now I come to think of it, entirely unlike the methods used by the estate agents. Married friends encourage the move, partly pleased that I haven't got clean away with it, but also whispering out of earshot of their partner that it's a brilliant idea to have two houses, and if only they had thought... and even my daughter, just left home and therefore instantly wise in the way of the world, smiles benevolently and says: 'You might as well, you're not getting any younger.' </p> <p>So now I am deracinated, looking into a black hole of debt ('No, no,' my more sophisticated friends explain, 'a mortgage isn't a debt' - although they have salaries, not publishers) and mortified in the sight of the god of my principles by myemotional volte-face. The first few decades of my existence were really extremely busy. My whole aim in the second half of my life was for nothing whatever to happen. It was my intention to become increasingly reclusive, decaying gently in one place, newspapers piling up, empty cat-food tins encroaching into the flower beds, clothes moth-holing, stockings sagging above my carpet slippers. Just describing it makes me feel restful, and perhaps all this will come about, but not quite yet, it seems. </p> <p>In the meantime, if you should hear of anyone who wants a charming, four-bedroomed flat with a verdant garden just a stone's throw from Hampstead Heath, previously owned by a careful, a very careful, lady writer who was last heard of going to the bad, you should not hesitate to get in touch. </p> <p>\u0095 Jenny Diski will be writing regularly in The Observer on the progress of her life-change.

Package holidaymakers whose travel plans are disrupted will be offered an alternative holiday or, if this is not possible, a flight home and possibly a refund. </p> <p>Only a handful of clients on the island of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands were affected by last week's storm. Caribtours relocated one couple staying at Biras Creek to a nearby island. </p> <p>British Airways Holidays announced its Hurricane Protection policy at the start of the summer season. In the event of a hurricane, holidaymakers are offered the option of returning to the UK or transferring to another holiday of equal value at no extra charge. All customers will also be offered 10 per cent off their holiday cost in vouchers to be used against future travel with British Airways Holidays. </p> <p>Independent travellers do not get the same protection and could find themselves footing the bill if extra nights' hotel accommodation are required due to delayed flights. Many travel insurance policies will not cover delays or expenses incurred by a hurricane as it is classified as an act of God. </p> <p>The hurricane season is officially from June to the end of October, but the most likely time for a hurricane to hit is late August or September. Brochure prices tend to reflect this fact with some of the cheapest deals being available in these months. </p> <p>Islands that have borne the brunt of tropical storms in recent years are Antigua, the Virgin Islands and the Leeward Islands such as St Kitts and Nevis. Historically, Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica and Cayman Islands have remained relatively unscathed. </p> <p>Caribtours managing director Catherine Leech said: 'Most people are pretty clued up as to when the hurricane season is. But it's difficult to warn people specifically about hurricanes when they are booking, as there is no real pattern to the season. Last year Hurricane Lenny took everyone by surprise in November.'</p>",
  "<p>As England continue to search for a central defender of quality who can bring the ball forward without looking as though he is kicking a magnetic mine, the progress of a burly Suffolk lad whose name belongs to a Thomas Hardy novel will be watched with interest.</p> <p>Titus Bramble has just turned 19 and his impact for Ipswich in the opening week of the new Premier League season has been considerable. Last Tuesday he was outstanding against Manchester United and on Saturday, as well as cramping the style of Sunderland's Niall Quinn, he scored the goal that brought Ipswich their first victory since promotion.</p> <p>It was not any old goal either. Seven minutes after half-time Bramble, having dispossessed Kevin Phillips, moved up to receive an astute pass from Marcus Stewart and then chested the ball down as he held off a challenge from Paul Butler before driving a low shot past Jurgen Macho. </p> <p>Sol Campbell may be Bramble's icon but, if the Tottenham defender possessed similar self-assurance and tight control of the ball once he crossed the halfway line, Kevin Keegan would be less despairing of England's present lack of invention. Rio Ferdinand, now out of Saturday's friendly against France with a hip injury, remains a possible answer but already Bramble looks a better defender than the West Ham player.</p> <p>Bramble's inclusion in the England Under-21 squad for the friendly against Georgia at Middlesbrough on Thursday is, therefore, well-timed. He first came into the Ipswich side at 17 but after impressive performances against Sunderland and Sheffield United in the Nationwide suffered a series of injuries which kept him out of the first team last season.</p> <p>A period on loan to Colchester United aided his recovery. Now the 6ft 1in, 13st 10lb youngster appears set to make a considerable impact on the Premiership. </p> <p>\"He's still got a lot to learn but he's been outstanding for us this season,'' said George Burley, the Ipswich manager, after Saturday's victory. \"He's so composed for a young lad,'' added Matt Holland, the Ipswich captain who on Saturday played his 170th consecutive game for the club. </p> <p>The ease with which each of Burley's three centre-backs brought the ball out of defence helped Holland and the other midfield players keep Sunderland's midfielders on the back foot, making it difficult for Don Hutchison to keep in touch with Quinn and Kevin Phillips.</p> <p>Mark Venus and Hermann Hreidarsson often preferred to create counter-attacks rather than simply clear their lines.</p> <p>In addition Bramble's handling of Quinn through a combination of physique and anticipation often denied Sunderland the advantage that the Irishman's height and heading power give their attack. As a result few chances came the way of Phillips, the only player likely to redeem a poor performance by Peter Reid's side.</p> <p>The one opportunity that fell to Phillips, five minutes before half-time, followed the only moment in the match when Bramble was caught out, his challenge on Quinn resulting in the ball rebounding to the Sunderland striker, who was left with only Richard Wright to beat. Uncharacteristically Phillips snatched at the shot and wafted it over the bar.</p> <p>Bramble's defensive capabilities were confirmed later on when he ended a run on the left from Kevin Kilblane with a tackle which both the Sunderland winger and the Ipswich supporters found stunning. \"A defender's tackle,'' said Burley. \"That's what the game's about.''</p> <p>Sounding uncannily like Kevin Keegan after Euro 2000, Reid complained that Sunderland \"didn't get the ball down well or pass it well. You can work hard at shutting people down but, if you don't pass the ball properly, you'll get nothing out of a match.''</p> <p>Though Sunderland recovered towards the end of last season their overall record since losing 5-0 at Everton on Boxing Day has undermined the pre-Christmas run that was promising a place in Europe. This time they may have to be content with keeping their place in the Premier League.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Cunning of Unreason</strong><br>John Dunn<br>HarperCollins \u00a316.99, pp367<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501008008,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The voters of the world stand on the plains and look upwards in bemusement. Journalists and politicians themselves stumble around the foothills of understanding. But the professor of political theory at Cambridge sits atop Mount Olympus, hurling his thunderbolts and mud pies with signal relish. Mere mortals, discarding their puny aspirations, must shrink from his presence. But there's no reason not to giggle and skip on your way. </p> <p>John Dunn equals wit and insight as well as scorn. This is a book - more accurately, a polemic - about democracy and the modern nation state. It begins with an abstract attempt to define the nature of politics, wearing its learning on its sleeve and dropping names with abandon. 'So are Machiavelli and Hobbes and Lenin and Carl Schmitt simply right?... Or does the truth lie more with Plato, or Thomas More, or Rousseau, or Fourier, or Karl Marx, or for that matter Confucius, or the Buddha?' But persevere: we'll get to John Major in a minute. </p> <p>The modern democratic republic, Dunn says, sounds like a fair system of rights embodied in a process of decision-making. 'But, directly encountered, it is quite obviously corrupt and feckless. Its outcomes are deeply pernicious and destructive. Its actual mode is a travesty of the system of rights which it continues to profess, and systematically distorts those rights in practice.' Our politics is 'disagreeable and frustrating'. The 'confusion and ineffectuality' of governance is endemic, 'ineradicable from the state form'. </p> <p>Everything, in sum, is charade and farce. Voting is a rough, unready way of steering the ship of state. The leaders it throws up, with their deluded dreams and phoney promises, are foredoomed to failure. And don't forget, either, how economics - the law of the allegedly free market - has come to dominate. 'The politics which it prompts most readily... is irritable, reactive, myopic: endlessly saturated with resentment.' A bilious tirade in the manner of the early Bernard Levin? Sometimes: and enjoyable in just that way. </p> <p>But Dunn strips away the cant to show us what lies behind. 'Capitalism has selected, refined and diffused quite widely a state form reconciled to human limitations (greed, quarrelsomeness, severely limited altruism) but still aimed at mitigating the vulnerability of its subjects and serving their more insistent and commonplace concerns.' This state form isn't 'inspiring or morally commanding'. 'We owe it no veneration... But we do owe it our loyalty and perhaps also some of our patience.' </p> <p>The Cunning of Unreason fizzes and stimulates precisely because it is Olympian in tone and judgment. Politics, its practitioners and servants, need to be pygmies on the plain: distance lends perspective as well as disenchantment. There is no 'progress' to high-toned goals. There is only muddling through.</p> <p>It's a valid and, at root, oddly positive thesis, the assertion of a clear-eyed reality. And yet I do have a problem. The contemporary meat in this sandwich of political science is Dunn's own take on the Thatcher years - her 'crusade against the tendency for every society's capacity for political agency to dissipate helplessly into endless factional squabbling and inanition... her Just War in which ultimate victory was in the end jeopardised by the pusillanimity of her colleagues and her (reluctantly chosen) successor'. </p> <p>When the gods of academe play pundit, they make themselves mortal. Dunn is at his frailest when he tries to fit his views about Thatcherism to the era of The Lady. Did she consciously set about 'lowering labour costs by shrinking employment'? Did she really - genuinely obsessive - set out to purge the Civil Service and the professions of education and medicine of their capacity to resist her will? Would she even have torn down the union movement if it had been cannier in its campaigning? </p> <p>None of this quite fits with the pensive, nervy Thatcher of Opposition painted so effectively in John Campbell's new biography, or with the real blankness of the 1979 manifesto. It's an unworthy thought, but you can't help wondering whether this particular Dunn vision owes more to affronted high-table chatter and the cuts that came alongside a university expansion which is (coldly considered) the biggest difference to our lives wrought in the last 15 years. More than that, he seems to think the tides of economic liberalism went out with Mrs T (which may be news to today's teachers or beleaguered doctors). </p> <p>But no harm done. Writing about politics is a human activity: and humanity's flaws are salt in the stew. Dunn attacks with a disarming lack of certainty not reflected in his surface rhetoric. He says he's 'blazing a trail, not laying down a road': and he's right. 'On present evidence, there are no dependable sources of insight, and no methods which, clearly grasped and accurately applied, ensure even the haziest comprehension of what's going on politically.' Quite. Trying to help us understand, though, is great fun - and so is this blazing book. One, you rather think, that Tony might keep by his bedside against the moment Leo wails again.</p>",
  "<p>Within seconds of our meeting at a West End hotel, I am profoundly irritated by the actress, Gina McKee. She's got a damned nerve being so pretty. Her looks - porcelain skin, soot-black hair, huge soulful eyes, long fragile limbs - lie somewhere between Beth Orton and a lost Modigliani. She's nice too, friendly and chatty, which comes as a surprise. McKee is famously tight-lipped about her personal life, to the point where past interviews read like masterclasses in stonewalling. </p> <p>Here McKee was refusing to talk about her parents. Here she was again, refusing to confirm that she had a husband and two children. Here she was yet again, just plain refusing. </p> <p>Although I loved McKee's work, and jumped at the chance to interview her, I couldn't help but feel slightly nervous about meeting such a media sphinx. I needn't have worried. Although she has a once-removed quality, which suggests a natural shyness, there was nothing like the agonised reticence I'd been expecting. </p> <p>It's true that McKee is a refusenik when it comes to discussing her personal life. 'Some people can do all that, and good luck to them,' she says. 'But I just don't feel comfortable. And I wouldn't be any good at it - showing people around my kitchen or whatever. I'd be pathetic in fact.' But from the moment she sits down, smiling and hugging her knees, she seems happy to discuss a variety of topics, including her career, emotions, insecurities, and the strange clunking noises emanating from the hotel chimney. 'Is that Santa, do you think?' she muses, deadpan. </p> <p>It isn't long before she is admitting to a fondness for football: 'I've never been emotionally engaged with football, but I did this voiceover for [a documentary about] Sunderland football club, and I was addicted,' she says. McKee's latest movie, There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, is about football, specifically a young boy's belief that a pair of magic boots is helping him to play as well as his Manchester City heroes. McKee plays Jimmy's mother with a fresh, zany warmth, quite at odds with the solemn intelligence she so memorably brought to Mary Cox, the character she played from 18 to 52 in the television drama, Our Friends in the North. </p> <p>During her career, McKee has displayed similar comic versatility: in commercials (she was the shop assistant who mortified the young boy in the Mates condom advert) and on television shows, including The Lenny Henry Show and Brass Eye. However, McKee is probably best known for bringing natural grace and gravitas to serious dramatic roles, from Mary Cox, to the disabled friend in Notting Hill, to the alcoholic mother in Mothertime, to most recently the sexually abused daughter on stage in Five Kinds of Silence at the Lyric, Hammersmith. </p> <p>But what of McKee herself? From the scant biographical details available, it seems that she is indeed married with children, and grew up in Easington, a colliery town in County Durham. During our conversation, a fuller picture emerges of a creative child from an ordinary background, who loved to draw, write stories, and act out plays. McKee confirms that, as a child, she had 'the sort of imagination that people almost criticise you for. I've always had this kind of creative energy.' </p> <p>McKee explains that while she wasn't encouraged by those around her, she wasn't discouraged either. 'It was a case of \"well, if you want to try it, why not?\"' She did try it, from the age of 14, in the afternoon television show Quest of Eagles, and then with the National Youth Theatre. At 17, McKee was turned down for drama school. Her response was to simply carry on work ing. For years, she tortured herself, thinking that she had missed out on some 'big secret', which would stop her becoming a great actress. Strangely, though maybe tellingly, McKee never thought to tell the drama school interviewers of her youthful successes. </p> <p>'It didn't occur to me,' she says, puzzled herself. 'I don't know why. It just would never have occurred to me to sit down and say: ' These are my attributes, this is what I can do. It took me years and years to understand how people promote themselves, not just in this business, but in life. It's a valuable skill, but I was never taught it. It wasn't part of my upbringing.' The merest shadow crosses McKee's face, but then she catches herself, and smiles. 'But you know, I didn't do too badly.' </p> <p>Since her Bafta-winning performance in Our Friends in the North, McKee has worked with directors as diverse as Mike Figgis (The Loss Of Sexual Innocence), Michael Winterbottom (Wonderland), Luc Besson (Joan of Arc), and Mike Leigh (Naked). 'I learned from all of them,' she says. 'But Mike Leigh was brilliant - totally liberating, but scary.' </p> <p>McKee's next project is the film Morality Place. Obviously gaining ground on the international stage, she remains a favourite with the British public. Two of her co-stars in There's Only Only One Jimmy Grimble are Robert Carlyle and Ray Winstone, which seems fitting: all three actors share a quality that makes their fans follow their progress almost as if they were rock bands. Jaded friends of mine became unusually animated at the mention of McKee's name. One friend who had seen a performance of Five Kinds of Silence reported that McKee exuded an 'integrity' which made it virtually impossible to tear your eyes away from her, even when she wasn't speaking. </p> <p> Five Kinds of Silence was the first theatre work she'd done for seven years, McKee was pleasantly surprised to find herself enjoying the experience. 'There is this thing about having a gap, which makes people think it's going to be really nerve-racking,' she says. 'But, as it got closer to the opening night, I thought I just don't feel this fear that other people are feeling on my behalf. I clearly had anxieties , but I don't think they were any worse than they would have been if I'd been in the theatre for the last few years.' </p> <p>It emerges that these anxieties are less debilitating than they are a creative spur: 'I'm extremely self-critical. Although I try not to be ridiculous about it, wearing horsehair shirts and all that. It's a private exercise I don't necessarily share with other people. A lot of the time, I'm not looking for reassurance. I suppose I'm just looking for ways to stop myself being lazy, to make sure I'm giving myself enough space to explore and create.' </p> <p>When she is talking about her work, McKee could not be more animated. When I ask her if she is still in acting for the same reasons she joined, she cries: 'What a lovely, lovely question, that's really made my day... Yes I am, yes.' Earlier she'd told me that acting was a gamble, but that you could end up with 'the most fantastic life'. It is only when the conversation dances too close to McKee's personal life that her voice trails away, and she becomes a sphinx once more. Even as we're talking, I'm realising that I'm not exactly getting anything new from her, or anything she hasn't made a concrete decision to give away. However, maybe this is a characteristic of self-made people. Early self-motivation got Gina McKee where she is, self-possession keeps her there, and, in the politest possible way, she is not about to relinquish control.</p>",
  "<p>There's something very familiar about Billy Elliot. On the surface it's the kind of British film we've come to expect. All the usual elements are in place: an urban working class background, disaffected youth, drab terraced housing and a close-knit community beset by conflict. It's the rite of passage, northern style. This tradition of kitchen sink realism is as British as wet bank holidays and equally predictable. </p> <p>But Billy Elliot, the debut from Stephen Daldry, a former director of London's Royal Court Theatre, is a film of big ambitions, a leap forward in terms of mood and scope. As cheering festival audiences at Cannes and last week Edinburgh can attest, there is something special and novel about Billy Elliot . But what is it? True, it owes a substantial debt to the documentary realism of Ken Loach. But this is realism not constrained by circumstance and location. Neither is it a feelgood fantasy like The Full Monty with an undeniable small screen pedigree. It is a celebratory, emotional film without cloying sentiment, which is no small achievement. </p> <p>More importantly, the film successfully mixes two elements, which at first might seem incongruous: gritty realism with joyous escapism. Think what might have happened if - however unlikely it sounds - Loach had directed West Side Story and you're on the right lines. </p> <p>Set in a north-east mining town during the 1984-85 strike, the story concerns an 11-year miner's son who discovers a wonderful yet inconvenient gift for ballet. Encouraged by his teacher, yet wary of telling his embattled, striking father and older brother, he learns surreptitiously. Although the action takes place a mere 15 years ago, this is a different kind of Britain, deep in the throes of the last great display of union strength. There is an air of siege mentality. In virtually every outdoor scene a policeman lurks in the corner of the frame, while barricades and riot shields are part of the landscape. </p> <p>Life is nasty, brutish and soon to be alarmingly different. But from the start Billy Elliot confounds expectations. The movie begins with a dream-like image of the young protagonist, played by newcomer Jamie Bell, apparently defying gravity, jumping through thin air. In fact, he is bouncing on his bed to the wistful sounds of Marc Bolan, but the tone is set. This is a film that intriguingly blurs reality with impressionism. </p> <p>The flights of fancy are taken further in the energetic dance scenes as Billy taps, pirouettes and slides on cobbled streets, rooftops, the bathroom - basically whenever the mood takes him. At times Billy Elliot feels like a musical. There are no elaborate, choreographed set pieces boasting a cast of hundreds but the film is reliant on movement and music to tell its story. As Billy's dancing improves so his awkwardness diminishes, but his dancing remains untamed, seemingly untutored and breathlessly evocative. As the camera swoops around the suspiciously empty streets in those scenes, the urban locale takes on a sort of grandeur. </p> <p>The film is propelled by Bell's finely balanced performance. He is an attractive but not winsome character whose bemusement, resentment and perseverance are evident. He has the soul of an artist but generally the tongue of a sullen and abrasive schoolboy. When Billy is given the opportunity to audition for ballet school his short temper proves calamitous. </p> <p> Kes, which sees a young boy's plight alleviated by a powerful hobby, quickly springs to mind. But although Loach's films contain humour, they are hardly humorous. Here, despite adversity, there is the comedy of manners, embarrassment and adolescent romance. </p> <p>The plot is admittedly conventional in its main theme, suggesting the only way out of this working class cul de sac is via a combination of natural talent and luck. Similarly, when the stricken community bonds together to pay for Billy's travel expenses to the climatic audition despite their own obvious hardship, the scene smacks of clich\u00e9. </p> <p>However, Billy Elliot is notable for its execution more than its familiar storyline. Stephen Daldry, working from Lee Hall's trenchant and witty script, displays a instinctive visual flair and cinematic understanding. 'Filmmaking is a matter of trying to find performances that you believe in and creating images that have emotional potency. Unlike most theatre, which is rooted in the re-creation of authentic experience, a lot of great movies are not about authentic experience at all, but rather they operate on a subconscious level - the language of dreams. That's the vernacular of film.' </p> <p>The 'language of dreams' has not been particularly significant in the canon of social realist films. The obvious artistry of Billy Elliot puts it at odds with many of its predecessors. The groundbreaking working class films of the Sixties such as Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, A Kind of Loving, Room at the Top were startling in their depiction of social inequities, but these were not films to savour for their cinematic verve. They were partially inspired by the similarly dour literary work of the Angry Young Men. </p> <p> The trend continued and its no surprise that influential modern British directors such as Loach, Mike Leigh and, especially, Alan Clarke looked at society from the same angle. In recent years Lynne Ramsey's Ratcatcher and Gary Oldman's Nil By Mouth have looked at urban dislocation and family neglect without flinching. </p> <p>These films were governed by a mission to document harsh experience. Personal and political themes are examined in the domestic environment. The desire to entertain might not be among the priorities, but that is exactly what Billy Elliot does. It is warm and palpably feelgood, yet thoughtful and provoking. It is hard not to be moved when Billy's dad, forced by circumstance, contemplates becoming a 'scab' worker. </p> <p> Of course Billy Elliot has been so well received partially due to the paucity of the competition. It seems, every week, another popgun gangster flick or flaccid ensemble relationship drama is unleashed, to a now suspecting public. Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels and TV's This Life have a lot to answer for. In fact, in addition to Ratcatcher and Nil By Mouth, it's often working class themed dramas such as A Room of Romeo Brass and Wonderland that have won plaudits. Like Billy Elliot though, the latter pair found optimism where others have tended to find little. </p> <p>This year has yet to see a British film that has delighted critics and set cash registers ringing. It suggests there is a captive audience for this year's Great British Film. Billy Elliot should put that straight . It has the right ingredients; charm, great cast, good soundtrack (who cares if the Bolan hits are from the wrong decade) and that all important X-factor. It gives the impression that audiences are seeing something new. For once, the billing doesn't lie. It's a breath of fresh air, which should challenge our notions of what our homegrown cinema can aspire to - both populist and persuasive. And the kitchen sink has never looked so gleaming. </p> <p>\u0095 Billy Elliot opens on 29 September</p>",
  "<p>There is a disease in the food world more rampant than any salmonella, BSE or swine fever. It has been slowly attacking our fruit, vegetables and even meat for some time and appears unstoppable. I call it creeping sweetness. </p> <p>One expects a certain sweet blandness to find its way into processed food. Sugar with everything is as much a part of general dumbing down as television makeovers. But it comes as more of a surprise when you find it has been bred into your tomatoes, peas, celery and carrots. </p> <p>It should surprise no one to find a hefty dose of saccharin in a corn cob. It ain't called sweetcorn for nothing. Yet not even this, our most sugar-coated of vegetables, has escaped the evil wand of the sugar fairy: a sugar-enhancing gene has been added to standard corn. The result is Supersweet, a cob of such heroic sugariness it should come with a dentist's warning on the wrapper. Avoid it. Unless you actually enjoy sucking sugar cubes. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: I can wolf a slice of pavlova or a sticky bun as fast as the next guy. What I have a problem with is when a vegetable, or a fruit, for that matter, has been tampered with so that its sweetness is out of proportion to its flavour. When I crunch into a hot, slithery corn cob, I want it to taste of corn, not golden syrup. </p> <p>The first of the English corn arrived only a few weeks ago and, despite our lack of sun this year, is eating well. So well, in fact, that I have had it four times already and will again tonight. There is no cheaper supper. I got six explicitly chubby cobs for a quid this morning. Just as well, because the quote for the repairs to the central heating arrived yesterday and I am still in shock. </p> <p>The first heads got their green papery husks peeled away, their strings of golden silks tugged off (so thoughtful of Mother Nature to provide us with dental floss for afterwards) and were then boiled in as much water as I could get into my largest pot. They bob about if you have the flame high, but not nearly enough to cook them evenly, so I often hold the cobs underwater with a capsized lid. Perhaps one should tie weights to them, as if you were disposing of a body in the Thames. No salt, they say, it toughens the kernels - though I must admit I have forgotten before now and it never seems to make that much difference. Boiling water, salt. It's a natural mistake. </p> <p>I approach corn in much the same way I do asparagus. Such a treat is the first of the locally grown that I do nothing more than boil-and-butter, but then, as the season moves on and the novelty thins, I get out the recipe books. </p> <p>Sweetcorn makes a velvety soup. I once had an American flatmate who would make up a vast pot for the weekend with tinned corn, thyme, bacon and, of all things, evaporated milk. It disappeared quick enough. The bacon fat settled on top in pools, holding in the soup's sweet heat. I religiously burned my tongue with every dip of the spoon, but would keep at it, like a child waggling a loose tooth. </p> <p>A soup with bacon bits and cream - what they call a chowder - is at its most wholesome when the bacon is smoked rather than 'green'. Cream and smoke always ring my bell, be it creamed kippers or that peaceful dish where you poach smoked haddock in cream and milk, then boil the cooking liquor down to a sauce_ but I am getting off the point. </p> <p>Grilled chicken and creamed corn is, like gammon and broad beans or grilled sole and creamed spinach, a perfect thing. The dish works on all counts, but especially the forkful that contains crisp, grilled skin and sweet, sloppy corn. The starch hiding in the kernels dispenses the need for any spuds. </p> <p>Depending on my level of malaise, I may use fresh corn or frozen for creaming. Sure, it is no big deal to slice the kernels off a cob, but creamed corn is one of those mysterious things I get an occasional craving for - and we all know the unwritten law of a craving is that you never, ever have its subject to hand. This, presumably, is why all-night garages sell food. I am not quite as anti the tinned or frozen corn niblet as some. I don't see the point of making a fuss when it is only going to end up in a sea of double cream and thyme. </p> <p>Two decades ago, there was a vogue for something called Chicken Maryland. Heaven on a plate for the sweet-toothed, it was a pudding masquerading as a main course: battered chicken, bacon, fried banana and, the best bit, sweetcorn fritters. My tastes have moved on a bit since then (notice I didn't say 'up'), but memories of its crunchy, greasy sweetness linger. The fritters, stripped of their battered buddies, are still worth making. Try them with the piquancy of a classic salsa verde. That'll send the sugar fairy packing. </p> <p>For those who are faced with a couple of sweetcorn cobs just too sweet to eat, I have just one word. Salt. The more salt you put on your cobs, the more the flavour of the corn will come out and the more the sweetness appears to back off. Like putting a pinch of salt in flapjacks - you taste the oats as much as the treacle. The same goes for those hybrid tomatoes, too. It may not cure swine fever, but it certainly works a treat for creeping sweetness. </p> <p><strong> Sweetcorn and bacon chowder </strong></p> <p> Serves 6 </p> <p><strong>30g butter </strong></p> <p><strong>2 plump salad onions or shallots </strong></p> <p><strong>300g smoked streaky bacon </strong></p> <p><strong>the leaves of 6 bushy sprigs of thyme </strong></p> <p><strong>4 corn cobs </strong></p> <p><strong>1.5 litres water </strong></p> <p><strong>150ml (or less) single cream </strong></p> <p><strong>a good handful of parsley </strong></p> <p>Melt the butter in a deep, heavy-based pan, the one you usually make soup in, then peel and roughly slice the onions, add them to the hot butter and let them soften over a low heat. Cut the bacon into thick chunks, about the size of a postage stamp, tearing off the rind as you go. You could use what some butchers sell off as bacon bits for this, checking them over for rind and bone, and cutting them into nuggets the size of a brazil nut. Whatever, let them fry with the onion, stirring only occasionally, so a thin layer of golden goo adheres to the pan. It will give a deep, smoky bacon flavour to the soup. </p> <p>Pull the leaves from the thyme branches and stir them in. Strip the kernels from the corn cobs - I do this by holding the cob upright on a board, one hand at the top, then slicing down with a large knife in the other. Then I turn it round and get the bit I missed at the top. You will get about 100g from each cob. Try not to catch any of the white core - it's tough. Tip the corn into the pan. </p> <p>Pour 1.5 litres of water over the sizzling bacon and corn, turn up the heat and bring it to the boil. You may get a small bit of golden froth on top, as you do with dried beans, and I think you should remove it. As the soup boils, turn down the heat so the corn rolls steadily in the simmering water. Don't be tempted to add salt - the bacon will serve for that. </p> <p>After 30 minutes, scoop out a little corn and check it for tenderness. It should be soft and, of course, sweet, with a distinct smoky flavour to it.

  "<p>It is 4.35am. The English countryside. May. Long ago, perhaps 1974. At 19 I had discovered that getting up early, really early, exactly fitted my rhythm and psyche. The early morning was mine and like any proselytizing coloniser, I felt that I alone owned this territory. I would quietly slip out into this private world, feeling like Columbus. For those of you who have never been to dawn in mid-May - and it is, without question, the best place that there is - it bubbles with birdsong. Not like March's shrill, almost hysterical dawn chorus, but wave upon distant wave of fading, gentle song. </p> <p>Now, at the end of August, this last May - any May day - seems like another country. But that particular May morning, a repetitive metal clicking drew me down the road. Not harsh, but insistent. Round a bend and the noise is coming from the top of a pair of wooden stepladders. Mr Woodhay is cutting the hedge at four-thirty in the morning. He is a dapper man, lean, with white moustache, cap, shirt and tie even at this time of day, bicycle clips tucking in the bottom of his trousers, although as far as I knew, he did not own a bicycle. For all his slimness, his forearms are beefy and his hands like great hams. In one of them is a pair of clippers. He has already done a few yards and has perhaps another 100 or more to go, right down the lane to the crossroads. I am intruding on his early privacy as much as he is on mine. We greet each other warily, me scarcely more than a boy, him older than my father but almost apologetic. </p> <p>'Thought I'd do a bit before it got too warm.' </p> <p>'It's early.' </p> <p>'Best to be up and doing. I'm always awake anyway.' </p> <p>I knew his story. Mr Woodhay had farmed a small dairy farm all his life - 120 acres on the border with Wiltshire. Small fields, all hedged, with a coppice and a stream. His father farmed it before him. He slept in the room he was born in, surrounded by the land he cared for. This is the patchwork of fields that people sentimentalise as 'The Country', only he had not an ounce of sentiment. He loved it, deep in the bone and hardly ever expressed it. </p> <p>He had the gentleness and slow strength of a man bred to the land. He loved his herd of cows. This was a deep and true passion. You can love a herd of animals just as you can love a house or a dog or a garden. </p> <p>Then the farm's 99-year lease expired and was not renewed. He had to sell up and get out in three months. Nearly 60 and everything he ever wanted over. A lesser man would have pined publicly, bitterly. I would. But he took the job offered him by the man who threw him off the land, and became his gardener. He was a refugee, watching his new employer come home each night in his Mercedes from his agribusiness that had an office but no farmhouse, grew crops that no one loved, used land with every hedge of the 2,000 acres grubbed out. And Mr Woodhay was polite and worked hard. He was delighted at little things. He had more dignity than any dignitary I have ever met. </p> <p>They had one daughter. Married, with kiddies. If the son-in-law had been interested, they might have taken on the farm, the lease safe for another century. But it was not to be. Three years after they moved, the daughter got cancer and started to waste terrifyingly fast. After a bit, Mr Woodhay couldn't bring himself to go to the hospital to see her, his little girl. She died inside six months. He got thinner, remained scrupulously polite, even smiled, but his eyes were terrified. And he got up at dawn, just as he had done all his life, for the milking, to clip the hedges of the man who took his farm from him. </p> <p>The hedge that he was cutting that morning was not a neat, foursquare job, a yew wall working like theatrical screens or a box edge marking patterns on the ground. There was no line or rule. This was a mixed hedge which was probably all of 500 years old, running around the five-acre garden. That five acres was one field that, like all fields, had a name, Pengessen, as old as the hedge and derived from the Old English 'gaerstun', which means an enclosed meadow. Fields have names because they are places with meaning and identity. Eventually the house, a Victorian villa, also took on the name of the field. </p> <p>The hedge comprised hawthorn, hazel, ash, blackthorn, oak, elder, dog rose, holly and ivy, all growing indiscriminately. It was a rolling, lumpy thing, a bit open at the bottom, and Mr Woodhay did not try and impose any particular shape on to it, merely going the way it inclined so that it ran round the garden with an organic flow to it rather than a fierce boundary. It was a marker more than a fence. Of course, cutting a hedge in May is likely to disturb nesting birds and probably not a good idea, although his clinking shears and light trim was not as hostile as the foursquare levelling of a power hedgecutter. Shears are hard work but make a good job for a fraction of the price of a hedgecutter. </p> <p>I often think of Mr Woodhay, particularly at this time of year when I cut the hedges in my own garden. At 19, I learned from him that life is both unremittingly hard and endlessly beautiful. And that you must carry on. </p> <p>I also often think about gardening as a substitute for farming, that all our little patches in a row are really the farms our hunting fathers tilled. Our English obsession with hedges is because really they are psychological remnants of the irretrievable fields that time and history have made into motorways and shopping centres. Instead of thinking of the garden as a series of outdoor 'rooms', perhaps we should more helpfully see it as a jumble of small fields, enclosed meadows, carved out of the wildwood that are our cities and suburbs and housing estates. </p> <p>The etymology of 'garden' is the same as yard and garth, and derives from the Old English 'geard', meaning enclosure or hedge. So, a hedged enclosure is the exact definition of a garden, just as it is of a field. </p> <p>'The Country' to most Englishmen is a hedged, farmed place. Every stupid, greedy farmer that rips out another hedgerow is despised not just because he is doing irreparable damage to the balance of the ecology for short-term gain but because he is clawing at the guts of the landscape and reaching into the viscera of our own gardens. </p> <p>We are all on a 99-year emotional lease. So instead of connecting the garden to the house by making it into a roofless living room, better to think of it as our land that we tend like a herd of dairy cows. We crop contentment, beauty, privacy, some prized bits and pieces of food and maintain that direct link to our own private farmed countryside. An Englishman's home is not his castle but his farm.</p> <p> <strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong> </p> <p>My lettuces have all been attacked by root aphids. This has never happened to me before, and very unpleasant it is too. I went away for a couple of days and came home to find rows of the things - Salad Bowl, Little Gem, Lobjoit's Cos - all collapsed into wilted heaps. Pull them up and you find that the rootball is smeared with a white, waxy film and dozens of white insects busily going about their daily grind. Apparently hot, dry weather causes it. So much for the miserable summer. At any rate the ground is very dry and, although it rained all day yesterday, only the top half-inch or so of open bare soil got a wetting, and where the borders are thickly planted almost nothing got through. </p> <p>While I was away, I picked up a paper and was reading an article in The Independent about garden makeovers - agreeing with almost every word - when I saw words to the effect that putting young gardeners like Monty Don on the cover of more traditional gardening magazines will harm sales. I liked the 'young' bit but was surprised at the rest. It went on to imply that you could tell that I did not know how to garden by the way I held my spade.</p> <p>I tried not to mind, but it began really niggling me, as one of the things I think that I can do as well as anybody, anywhere, is to handle a spade - especially my favourite stainless-steel, Bulldog one, ten years old now and worn unevenly at the corners through hours - weeks, months - of hard use.</p> <p>Weeks and weeks overdue we have cut the long grass in the orchard. The main problem of doing this every year is getting the machinery. I have done it before with a scythe, but is does take ages to do it not very well. Our rotary mower will not begin to do it. A rotary cutter is best, but they have to be exceptionally powerful. I finally got hold of a Honda machine which looked as though it would not mow a lawn, let alone an orchard, but I have to say it has been quite brilliant. It quietly trudges through the grass - all of which has been battered by rain and become matted, and turns it into rows of compost-to-be. I spent a happy Sunday in the drizzle, opening out the orchard and raking the grass into great heaps, fantasising of bringing magazine empires to their knees with a mere glimpse of me clutching my favourite spade in a thoroughly louche manner. Dig it!</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Monty's tips on hedge manicure </strong></p> <p>If you are cutting your hedges straight, they are best done with sides that gently slope out so that the base is wider than the top. This is called a 'batter' and lets light get to the bottom half of the hedge . </p> <p>Topiary of any kind is best done with shears or a light electric hedgecutter. If using shears, hold one hand still and 'work' only one side. This gives more precise control.</p> <p>The more you trim a young hedge, the denser it will grow. So leave it until it has reached the height you want and then trim it off. Also, try and keep young hedges narrow - it is all too easy to let a hedge become sprawling and not very thick.</p> <p>If you have a young or unhealthy hedge, give it a foot-wide stretch of bare soil either side .</p> <p>Leyland cypress can be used to make hedges but, unlike yew or box, it cannot be cut back hard, so little and often is the way to go.</p>",
  "A raven-haired lady in a cardigan, more grandmother than grand inquisitor, seizes the microphone, her voice choked with emotion. 'I would rather give up my soul than give up the krone,' she insists. <p>A sea of grey and blond heads nod in agreement. Her image is projected on a giant screen and her words are relayed to television sets across Denmark. </p> <p>A sprightly pensioner, who has been copiously taking notes for the past hour, rises to his feet and speaks in a level voice. 'Can you give us a guarantee that our economic policy will not be decided by Europe in five years' time?' he demands of economy minister, Marianne Jelved. </p> <p>The venue is Christiansborg Castle, home of the Danish parliament (Folketinget), and the public hearing is one of many events being staged in the run-up to Denmark's euro referendum on 28 September. </p> <p>The stakes are high, and not only in Denmark. The outcome will have a major influence in Britain and Sweden, where eurosceptics hope a No vote will strengthen their hand. And the closeness of it all fills British euro-supporters with unease. </p> <p>There is, after all, every reason for Denmark to join the euro zone. It has one of the strongest economies in the world. It has been involved in the European project from the beginning, if at times hesitantly. It fulfils the convergence criteria except for inflation, and its own currency, the krone, is rock solid. </p> <p>But it is emotion, not economic reason, which is driving the No campaign. In the Nineties the Danes endorsed Maastricht reluctantly, and at the second time of asking. Now they must decide again. </p> <p>With just a month to go before two-thirds of the country's 5.3 million Danes say 'ja' or 'nej', the vote is balanced on a knife edge. Polls show the margin of victory is likely to be just a few percentage points. To the outsider this is baffling, since the odds seems so stacked in the Yes camp's favour. </p> <p>The political elite in the form of the ruling centre-left Social Democrat minority government favours a Yes vote, and 80 per cent of Danish MPs agree. Most newspapers and big business and the entire trade union movement are also ready to bid 'farvel' to the krone. And the Yes camp is much better funded than the No camp after it scooped most of the 25 million kroner (\u00a32m) in public funds earmarked to fight the campaign. </p> <p>The No side is a rag-tag coalition of the extreme right and left and a couple of die-hard eurosceptic grass-roots organisations. They have little in common and in some cases loathe one another. </p> <p>The right-wing element, the ultra-nationalist Danish People's Party (DPP) or Dansk Folkeparti, wants to see paedophiles castrated, aid to the third world privatised, refugees repatriated and Denmark kept for the Danes. Many of its members compare the euro project to Hitler's failed attempt to foist the Reichsmark on occupied Europe: 'The technique is about combining power. Hitler wanted to combine power in his hands and the European Commission wants to combine power in its hands,' says Mogens Camre, a Euro MP for the party. The euro has been embraced, he adds, by 'frail, weak, badly run and corrupted' countries. </p> <p>The DPP may be extreme but the Danes are listening to what it has to say on the euro. </p> <p>The campaign is typically Danish: low key, civilised and orderly. The Yes camp has its 'euro truck' which tours the country providing a platform for high-profile government politicians to take the debate to the far-flung corners of Jutland. And the No side has its 'krone car'. </p> <p>The news is full of little else, and public hearings and TV debates are in full swing. The arguments are well rehearsed. The Yes side believes ditching the krone and embracing the euro is a small price to pay for greater influence within the EU and financial stability. They shudder when they talk about 1998, the year the krone had to be defended three times from speculative attack. </p> <p>Denmark's economic independence is in any case illusory, they insist, since the krone has been pegged to the Deutchmark and later the euro since 1982. So what is there to lose? </p> <p>'It's about influence,' says Anders Panum Jensen, the youthful secretary-general of the Danish European Movement. 'Outside the euro we lose influence on economic issues, especially in the euro zone. How much will other politicians pay attention to Danish arguments when we are not part of the core group?' </p> <p>Lars Kjolbye, international secretary of the Danish Conservative Party, agrees: 'The Danish currency is not in a position to stand alone if we remain outside the euro. We will be dependent on the decisions made by the euro 12 anyway. Denmark is better off if we have a place at the table.' </p> <p>He insists Denmark will not be giving up sovereignty. 'Do you think the French and Germans would abolish the franc and mark if they thought they were giving away their sovereignty?' he laughs. </p> <p>The idea that Denmark will be relegated to the margins of Europe as a bit player, ignored and excluded from the club and defenceless in the face of globalisation, resurfaces again and again. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democrat prime minister and architect of the referendum, has argued passionately that his country must join the euro or face obscurity. 'Denmark must be where the decisions are taken. It is unacceptable that we should not have any influence on the decisions which ultimately affect our everyday lives,' he told the Folketinget in May. </p> <p>Both sides are agreed on one thing: this is the most important referendum in Danish history and will be a decisive moment for Denmark's relationship with the rest of Europe. </p> <p>DPP board member Carl Christian Ebbesen outlines the far-right's case for a No vote. 'We don't look at it as an economic project. We are fighting to keep the krone and to keep the values of Danish society. By that we mean keeping control of Danish society in Danish hands. Denmark will have to be like other European countries and we don't want that. If there is a Yes vote the politicians will create a federal union, but we like to be Danes and do it our way,' he says. </p> <p>Holger Nielsen, dynamic leader of the Danish Socialist People's Party, the other main party campaigning against the euro, is keen to distance himself from the DPP. 'The euro is not a question of being conservative but of democracy. It's important for us to stress that it's not a right-wing or xenophobic position. It's not fair to say that resistance is built on right-wing values,' he said in an interview with The Observer. </p> <p>'But if you have a common currency, political power will be transferred from national parliaments to Brussels, to bureaucrats and technocrats. When you have an economic union you also have a political union.' And that, he adds, is bad for democracy. </p> <p>Denmark could be in the EU and outside the euro, he adds, and still be 'a good European'. Nielsen also worries that a decision to join the euro could lead to Denmark's fabled tax-financed 'Rolls-Royce' welfare state being fatally weakened and that people would be forced to start paying health insurance in the name of harmonisation. This strikes a chord with many Danes. </p> <p>What does not go down well here is outside intervention. Efforts by British Tories to raise money for the No campaign are widely mocked and despised, and almost every naysayer agrees that they can only backfire, turning off large numbers of left-wing voters. Yet on 3 September, Daniel Hannan, a Tory MEP for south-east England, will address a rally of the far-right DPP and urge the Danes to say No. The Yes camp can't wait. </p> <p>Denmark's sixth referendum on the EU is shaping up to be explosive. When the Danes said no to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, it rocked the EU and triggered a series of currency crises. Anarchists rioted in the Norrebro suburb of Copenhagen and police had to open fire. </p> <p>There are likely to be fewer fireworks on 28 September but the consequences could be just as far-reaching. If Denmark says Yes, Britain will find itself increasingly isolated outside the euro and the single currency will have absorbed one of Europe's strongest economies. </p> <p><b>There is nothing like a Dane...</b><br></p> <p> Denmark is known as the 'footnote' country because of the special exceptions it has negotiated in European treaties. </p> <p><b> History</b> </p> <p>Constitutional monarchy.

  "<p>The portents weren't good when Prime Minister Tony Blair opened Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle last June. </p> <p>What should have been a triumph for the Government - a shiny new 'Third Way' hospital built for the public using private money - turned into farce when protesting foxhunters drowned out the self-congratulatory opening speeches. </p> <p>Maybe it was indeed a sign because, since Blair's ill-fated visit, things have gone terribly wrong at Cumberland, the country's first hospital financed by the controversial private finance initiative: </p> <p>\u0095 Two ceilings have col lapsed because of cheap plastic joints in piping and other plumbing faults - one joint narrowly missed patients in the maternity unit.<br> \u0095 The sewerage system could not cope with the number of users and filth flooded an operating theatre. <br> \u0095 Clerical and laundry staff cannot work in their offices because they are too small. <br> \u0095 Expensive bespoke trolleys had to be commissioned because those supplied don't fit the spaces between beds. <br> \u0095 The transparent roof means that on sunny days the temperature inside Cumberland Infirmary reaches over 33C - the hospital has no air conditioning. <br> \u0095 Two windows have blown out of their frames, one showering a consultant and a nurse with glass. </p> <p>These 'mistakes' are bad enough, but what is worse is that in August, when hospitals are usually quiet, there are now 'bed jams' at the 444-bed Cumberland, which is currently at full capacity. </p> <p>'God only knows what will happen in the winter,' a Unison spokesman said. 'It's appalling and the whole PFI project, not just Carlisle, seems to be flying in the face of Blair's National Plan for the NHS to get more beds into the system.' </p> <p>A spokesman for the infirmary confirmed each of the problems: 'We acknowledge there have been teething problems but we don't feel they're related to PFI.' </p> <p>The summer bed jam is blamed by the Carlisle Trust on 'an unusual number of emergency admissions, which is blurring the line between summer and winter'. </p> <p>Amec, the main construction company on the project, whose shares have leapt 40 per cent in six weeks thanks to increased public spending earmarked in last month's Comprehensive Spending Review, would not comment on specifics, other than to say: 'We are extremely proud of our work in Carlisle and any problems are part of teething difficulties associated with major projects.' </p> <p>But those in Carlisle disagree. They say what is wrong with Cumberland is symptomatic of a deeper malaise. The first PFI hospital represents all that critics hate about this funding model. They say PFI is a totally unsatisfactory solution that will divert money from health provision into the hands of accountants, lawyers, surveyors and construction companies. </p> <p>The most fundamental criticism is that the NHS is paying over the odds for new hospitals. Under the PFI model, a private-sector consortium owns a building and leases it back to a health trust. Most lease contracts, including Cumberland, have rents linked to the retail price index and last 30 years or longer. </p> <p>Cumberland will pay \u00a311 million in rent this year to the PFI consortium. Inflation currently stands at 2.2 per cent. That means next year Cumberland will fork out an extra \u00a3242,000 in rent. </p> <p>While inflation is now under control, no one knows how the economy will pan out in five years, let alone 30 years. </p> <p>'We could be paying well over \u00a3500m for a hospital which only cost \u00a367m,' said one Cumberland insider. </p> <p>Small wonder an Institute of Directors survey last June found that 70 per cent of those involved in PFI believe it provides an investment opportunity with a reasonable return and without unmanageable risk. </p> <p>With the pressure to create a decent return for the private sector, all costs are squeezed. Smaller hospitals cost less to build and the British Medical Association estimates that 5,000 beds will be lost to the system once the 38 PFI hospitals, costing more than \u00a33.6 billion, are built. </p> <p>Reducing the number of beds is not necessarily a bad thing. But, as in the case of Cumberland, a reduction in beds could prove fatal come winter. </p> <p>Health Minister Alan Milburn was so concerned about PFI bed cuts that he ordered the \u00a3900m University College Hospital PFI scheme, again led by Amec, to increase bed provision. Observers say this will push costs to well over \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Architects, meanwhile, are often frozen out of the PFI design process and cheap materials are used in many schemes. </p> <p>'The main difficulty for the architect is that we are kept away from hospital workers. Our client is the consortium. This doesn't serve the best interest of design and that's why mistakes happen,' said one architect who has worked on many hospital PFI projects. </p> <p>Advocates of PFI say that following Treasury guidelines on PFI last March, the NHS is no longer forced to accept the lowest tender for a scheme and that 'best value' are now the watchwords. This will see the quality of future hospitals improve. </p> <p>That may be, but in Dudley, West Midlands, ancillary workers have more pressing concerns. They are poised to strike because new workers in the PFI hospital will not be guaranteed NHS pensions. </p> <p>In Worcestershire, there are fears that David Lock, the Kidderminster Labour MP, could lose his seat to an independent opposed to plans to merge the local hospital with one in Worcester, leading to a 28 per cent reduction in acute beds. </p> <p>But the PFI hospital bandwagon rolls on. Since May 1997, the Government has given the go-ahead for 38 - half are under way. </p> <p>Within months, NHS Estates, which is responsible for the Health Service's property portfolio worth \u00a323bn, will sell a \u00a3900m chunk of its real estate. Once sold, the money will be used to part-fund more PFI schemes because the Treasury and the Department of Health are adamant that there is no alternative to PFI. </p> <p>The days of public infrastructure projects paid and owned by the state are clearly over. But the legacy of hospital PFI schemes in years to come may make last winter's NHS crisis, when a flu epidemic nearly brought the system to a standstill, seem like a fuss about nothing. </p> <p><strong>What is the Private Finance Initiative (PFI)?</strong> <br> The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) is a method used in public sector projects such as the building and operation of trunk roads, rail and underground train networks, government computer systems and the construction of NHS hospitals. It was launched by the Conservative government in 1992 and has been enthusiastically continued by Labour. </p> <p>PFI's aim, said the Treasury in 1997, is to transform 'public sector organisations from being owners of assets and direct providers of services into purchasers of services from the private sector'. </p> <p>Once a consortium wins the right to build, for example, a new hospital, after costly tendering processes, it will lease the buildings back to the NHS at market rates for between 20 and 60 years.In the long run this is demonstrably more expensive than if the NHS was to build its own hospitals, not least because the private sector cannot borrow money as cheaply as government. </p> <p>Also, professional fees for lawyers, accountants and surveyors can lead to hefty additional costs. </p> <p>So why do it? By giving the private sector responsibility for providing services and buildings for the public sector, the Treasury can keep these projects off balance sheet which means public borrowing is lower.</p>",
  "In 1980 THEY were just a gang of neo-Nazi skinheads who spent their time disrupting concerts by the Specials and the Beat or breaking up anti-racist punk gigs in Belfast. <p>They followed Offensive Weapon, a band modelled on British Nazi-skins groups. They wore 'Hang Nelson Mandela' T-shirts and gave pro-Hitler press interviews saying that he should have 'gassed the Taigs (a pejorative word for Catholics) as well'. </p> <p>Twenty-years later these 30 to 40 young loyalists, who formed the core of the now defunct National Front branch in Belfast, are now the cadre of Johnny Adair's C company of the Ulster Freedom Fighters - the assassination arm of the Ulster Defence Association. </p> <p>These men, who are at the centre of the current Ulster loyalist feud that has claimed three lives, have been ferociously loyal to each other over the last two decades. They went to school together, they fought running street battles with Catholic Skin head gangs, they were inducted into the UDA around the same time in the Eighties and they plotted and killed in the Nineties. </p> <p>The old Shankill skinhead alterk\u00e4mpfen (old comrades) include Sam 'Scally' McCrory who was imprisoned for terrorism and met Mo Mowlam, then Northern Ireland Secretary, during her visit to the the Maze in 1998 to beg the UDA to stop killing Catholics. McCrory has 'White power' tattooed on his right hand. </p> <p>Several of C company's main killers were also in the skinhead gang. Another is a young loyalist nicknamed Top Gun because of his involvement in scores of sectarian murders. One of the armed and masked UFF men who stopped cars at a televised terrorist checkpoint a fortnight ago was a former NF skinhead and a close friend of Adair. Adair himself was a member of the NF Skinz, who graduated from soccer hooliganism to terrorism. </p> <p>A senior RUC officer has watched C company's trajectory from skinheads to sectarian assassins: 'The community on the Shankill is reaping what they sow. These boys were once just an ordinary gang of thugs who were then elevated into defenders of the people. Now they are turning on their own people. </p> <p>'They are not just motivated by drugs, that's facile. Intelligent drug dealers don't draw attention to themselves by going to armed displays and starting feuds with the UVF. These people are fanatical loyalists who want the war to start again.' </p> <p>Even with their leader back in prison this weekend, the police officer said this closely knit group still has the capability to cause mayhem and sectarian carnage on the streets of Greater Belfast. </p> <p>Their stronghold is the Lower Shankill estate, a maze of publicly owned houses close to the nationalist Unity Flats and Antrim Road. Unemployment is high, educational achievement low. The drabness of the estate is lit up by the large number of paramilitary murals dedicated to C company's exploits as well as red, white and blue paving stones and flags of the UDA. </p> <p>When the inter-loyalist violence erupted on the Shankill Road last Saturday, C company's first move was to 'cleanse' their base of any supporters of the rival Ulster Volunteer Force. </p> <p>Thirty-six families were forced out; some of whose homes were torched and vandalised. Some of the families were targeted because their sons played in the Shankill Protestant Boys, a flute band with UVF connections. By the middle of last week anyone with even a tentative link to the UVF had been forcibly expelled from the Lower Shankill estate. </p> <p>Agnes Street links the Shankill with the Crumlin Road where UFF member Jackie Coulter and former loyalist activist Bobby Mahood were killed on Monday. For Shankill residents the street has become the dividing line between the two halves of their community. The Lower Shankill is now a UFF/UDA-controlled zone, the middle Shankill Road is a UVF dominated sector. </p> <p>Throughout last week Chris McGimpsey, an Ulster Unionist councillor for the area and an ally of his party leader David Trimble, worked around the clock to re-house the 36 families forced out by the UFF. Up until last Friday his office, which is equidistant from the UVF and UDA headquarters on the Shankill, was packed with displaced, anxious men, women and children seeking new homes. </p> <p>Today's C company are second generation loyalists who followed the example of men such as John White, the chairman of the UDA's political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party. White was jailed for a double murder in the Seventies and on his release in 1991 became a hero to younger loyalists like Adair. </p> <p>White supports the Good Friday Agreement but many of the young men he inspired to join the UFF are sceptical about the peace process believing it is loaded in favour of republicanism. </p> <p>The UDP has lost the political argument with influential UDA/UFF units like C company, which are bound together solely by a visceral hatred of all Catholics and nationalists. </p> <p>Large sections of the British and Irish media have sought to portray the feud as nothing more than a squalid turf war over drugs, criminal rackets and territory. But these are secondary factors. The most important antecedent of the current slaughter is the sharp division between pro- and anti-Agreement wings of violent loyalism. The Ulster Volunteer Force is the oldest of the loyalist terror groups. It is descended from Sir Edward Carson's private army founded in 1912 to resist Home Rule for Ireland. Its present leadership has been in place for more than 20 years and is organised along strict centrist lines, whereas the UDA is run by collective leadership with individual brigadiers who are given considerable freedom to do what they like. </p> <p>The UVF's political representatives, the Progressive Unionist Party, has some of the most articulate loyalists in its ranks. David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson, both members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, are household names in both parts of Ireland. Their political analysis is that unionists and loyalists should work the Agreement for their benefit, that the peace deal is predicted on the principle that Northern Ireland cannot leave the UK without the consent of its people. </p> <p>The present feud follows the pattern of earlier UVF-UDA conflicts. In the mid 1970s there were two vicious feuds at a time of constitutional uncertainty and change. One organisation, the UVF, looked for a political way forward reaching out for compromise with republicans and nationalists. The other sought to gain hegemony within the Protestant community by becoming more sectarian and belligerent and by painting the UVF as crypto-communists and 'Fenian lovers'. </p> <p>What is really occurring on the narrow streets off the Shankill Road this weekend is a struggle for the future of Ulster loyalism. One section of the UDA in Protestant West Belfast is sliding inexorably back to wider conflict with Irish nationalists as well as their fellow loyalists. </p> <p>The UVF, however, wants no part in renewed sectarian warfare although it claims it has no choice but to stand and fight rival loyalists for its survival. </p> <p>Most disturbing of all is the third generation of junior UFF members, the Ulster Young Militants, who were behind many of the attacks on UVF homes in the Lower Shankill last weekend. </p> <p>According to born-again Christian Pastor Jack McKee, the UFF and to a lesser degree the UVF have been recruiting hundreds of teenagers from the area, preparing them for war when Northern Ireland is meant to be at peace. </p> <p>In some schools, McKee said, members of the rival loyalist youth wings have to be let out of different gates at the end of the school day to avoid clashes. </p> <p>Many of the UYM were wearing T-shirts glorifying Adair and C company along the Shankill over the last week. Beneath pictures of Adair and a row of masked men brandishing machine guns and Kalashnikov rifles were the words: 'C company, simply the best'. </p> <p>Who would have thought that the skinhead gang that ran amok at a Specials concert in the Ulster Hall 20 years ago, chasing ska fans including this writer into the back stage, would evolve into a small but ruthless terrorist unit capable of threatening 10 years of talks, peace deals and historic compromises?</p>",
  "Prisoners belonging to the Continuity IRA - a republican terror group opposed to the Irish peace process - are planning an H-block-style series of dirty protests and jail disturbances, including a return to the hunger strike tactic, in a new fight for political status. <p>The Continuity IRA has told The Observer it plans to disrupt the running of Maghaberry jail outside Belfast, the prison to which loyalist leader Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair was taken after his rearrest last week. </p> <p>The scene is now set for a major confrontation involving republican dissidents, the prison authorities who refuse to recognise the inmates as political, and the loyalists under Adair's control. </p> <p>Tommy Crossan, the commanding officer of the Continuity IRA prisoners in Northern Ireland, says he is even prepared to follow Bobby Sands's example in pursuit of political status.

I was 10 ten when he died, that's when I became interested in republi canism but everything he fought for has been sold out.

Now Adair is living cheek-by-jowl with Crossan and his CIRA comrades in Maghaberry. </p> <p>Crossan is serving 10 years for conspiracy to murder RUC officers following a gun attack on a police station in west Belfast almost two years ago. He spends 23 hours a day locked in his cell as punishment for refusing to do prison work. </p> <p>The Northern Ireland Prison Service is adamant it will not allow Maghaberry to go the way the Maze went with paramilitary-controlled, segregated wings and IRA and loyalist prisoners running the jail in all but name. </p> <p>'I am determined to go through with this protest, whether that means a dirty protest or eventually a hunger strike. I am a political prisoner, not a criminal,' he said echoing the anti-H-Block campaigns of the Seventies and Eighties. </p> <p>'There will be four more Real IRA prisoners coming on to the sentenced section of this jail in a few months. We will hopefully co-operate on the campaign for political status, and together even seven of us can make this place ungovernable. </p> <p>'I am confident that the armed struggle will go on outside here and that, sadly, will mean more of my comrades being jailed and sent into this place. The bigger we get, the harder it will be for the authorities to treat us as criminals.' </p> <p>Continuity IRA was formed after splits in Republican Sinn Fein in 1986.

  "US-style 'televangelism', currently banned from national airwaves, could be allowed into Britain. <p>Under heavy pressure from some Christian groups, the Government is considering allowing religious groups the right to apply for terrestrial radio licences in this autumn's White Paper. </p> <p>Religious groups have been prevented from running radio and television stations of the kind common in the United States because of worries about the excesses of American preachers, well known for their extremist views. </p> <p>But the Christian lobby is pushing hard for a change in the law and is threatening to sue the Government under human rights legislation unless it gives in. </p> <p>Broadcasting Minister Janet Anderson has held several meetings over the summer with interdenominational charity United Christian Broadcasters (UCB), which already has two local satellite licences but is blocked from getting the national terrestrial licence it wants for a mass audience. </p> <p>'If you have a national media, the fact that you would exclude Christians from it is extraordinary,' said Olave Snelling of the Christian Broadcasting Council, which is backing the legal case. </p> <p>'Probably there is a fear of cults, but I would have thought the Government could hedge these things around with all sorts of caveats in legislative terms,' she added. </p> <p>Government insiders, however, say it is difficult to define in law which religious groups would be eligible. There is also intense competition for spare frequencies on Britain's crowded airwaves, with new slots going to stations with the widest appeal. </p> <p>'Christianity is very much a minority pursuit,' said National Secular Society secretary Keith Porteous-Wood. 'We are concerned about vulnerable people receiving radio broadcasts in their own home.' </p> <p>However, a paper from UCB managing director Gareth Littler, submitted to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's White Paper review, insists that 'legitimate religious groups such as UCB' should be treated 'in the same way as our secular counterparts in terms of broadcasting ownership and content regulation.' </p> <p>It adds that only a change in the 1990 Broadcasting Act would avoid 'discrimination against legitimate religious organisations in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights.' </p> <p>The group has engaged David Pannick QC and is already pursuing a case. </p> <p>UCB currently broadcasts from its Stoke-on-Trent base via satellite a menu of prayer, music and Bible teachings but wants a national audience. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Culture said: 'Ministers are well aware of this campaign and it is among the things they are considering in drawing up the White Paper.' </p> <p>Details of the legislation, including control of programme content rules on cross-media ownership, will be discussed next month by its authors Chris Smith and Trade Secretary Stephen Byers.

  "Al Gore is finally on a roll. But where will it take him? This past week he's been telling Americans 'we've got to put you first' and not 'the ones with connections, the ones with wealth, the ones with power above and beyond what the average family has in this country'. He's for the people, while 'the other side' is for the powerful. <p>It's good old-fashioned hell-fire-and-brimstone political rhetoric. During the Thirties, Franklin D. Roosevelt condemned the 'economic royalists' - America's big businesses that, he said, were stomping on average Americans. In 1912, progressive Republican Teddy Roosevelt blamed the 'malefactors of great wealth' for subjugating the 'little man' of America. In the 1890s, prairie populist William Jennings Bryan (who almost made it to the White House) railed at the bankers and other 'powerful interests' who were 'bankrupting' hard-working people. </p> <p>But this kind of talk hasn't been heard from a Democratic Presidential candidate since the dismal final week of Michael Dukakis's ill-fated 1988 Presidential run, when, with his candidacy sinking like a stone, Dukakis briefly and suddenly became an economic populist. By then, of course, it was too late. </p> <p>It hasn't been heard from Al Gore, either - until two weeks ago. Quite the contrary. In the 1988 Democratic primary, Gore ran as a business-friendly moderate. A few years later he helped launch the Democratic Leadership Council - a refuge for so-called 'new' Democrats who wanted nothing to do with pro-union, corporate-bashing old Democrats. </p> <p>In 1992, Gore teamed up with Bill Clinton on a brazenly New Democrat (forerunner of Tony Blair's Third Way) platform. Then, as Vice President, he urged Clinton to slash the budget deficit and go slow on new programmes for health care and education so that American corporations could enjoy lower interest rates. And he spurred Clinton into making free trade a top priority. Gore then led the fight for the North American Free Trade Act, followed by the agreement setting up the World Trade Organization. Business loved him for it. The unions were less than overjoyed. </p> <p>But in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention Gore suddenly became a new Gore sounding like an old Democrat - telling Americans he sympathized with how 'so often powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your way and the odds seem stacked against you', and then naming the culprits: 'Big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the HMOs [Health Maintenance Organisations].' </p> <p>Gore fired up the delegates, and fired himself up as well. He pledged to 'fight' for 'working families' - a code term for 'the working-class', which he reiterated nine times - and vowed to take on the big guys. 'Sometimes you have to be willing to stand up and say no, so families can have a better life.' </p> <p>And he has kept at it since then. Will he hammer the theme all the way through the crucial presidential debates - three of them tentatively scheduled for October - and on to election day, 7 November? </p> <p>It's a calculated risk. Undoubtedly Gore got a 'bounce' from his performance at the Democratic convention. Polls now put him slightly ahead of George W. Bush. Before the convention, he was trailing by about 15 points. The new rhetoric also seems to make Gore a more passionate campaigner - a quality he desperately needs. Otherwise, he's stiff and technocratic, especially in contrast to George W. Bush's glib geniality. </p> <p>The 'people versus the powerful' theme exactly points up the distinction Gore wants to highlight between him and George W. It's the Republicans' biggest vulnerability - the public's lingering worry that Republicans only care about the privileged. That's why Bush has been pushing his 'compassionate' conservatism, and talking non-stop about education. </p> <p>But George W. Bush can't hide the facts: After all, congressional Republicans have blocked popular legislation aimed at tobacco, environmental pollution, pharmaceutical companies, and HMOs. Their recent tax cuts have all been sops to America's wealthiest. And - most important - Bush's own plan for a massive tax cut would overwhelmingly benefit richer Americans. The people versus the powerful, indeed. </p> <p>Gore's rhetoric could also fire up the Democratic 'base' - unionized workers, teachers, and public employees. Gore needs to energize them for the election. Not only do they have to be motivated to vote, but also to run the phone-banks and drive the vans that will get other Democrats to the polls on election day. </p> <p>Until now, the base been only luke-warm toward Gore. Some (especially in all-important California) have even toyed with the idea of voting instead for left-wing Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. </p> <p>But Gore's new strategy also poses substantial risks. </p> <p>It's hard to tell Americans they're powerless and vulnerable while at the same time telling them they've never had it so good. The two messages directly conflict. Yet surely Gore's biggest selling point is he's been second-in-command in an administration that presided over eight years of extraordinary economic growth. Unemployment and inflation are now lower than they've been in 30 years, median wages are rising, and even Americans at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder are starting to make progress. 'Are you better now than you were eight years ago, when they were in office?' is a more persuasive rhetorical question than 'do you feel like you're being screwed by them and their powerful friends?' But Gore can't very well expect people to say yes to both. </p> <p>In fact, most voting Americans don't like to think of themselves as powerless, and they don't much like class warfare because they hope to hit the jackpot one day and become rich. Populist rhetoric may fire up the Democratic 'base' but it's tended to be a loser with America's large and upwardly-mobile middle class. </p> <p>Meanwhile, poor and working-class Americans who have more reason to feel powerless have all but stopped voting. In 1996, less than half of adult Americans eligible to vote actually walked into voting booths, and most of those who didn't were in the bottom half of the income ladder. This is precisely why in recent years, Democratic politicians - including Bill Clinton and Al Gore in 1992 and, especially, in 1996 - have pitched their campaigns to the upscale suburbs, and why Democrats have tended to drift to the right, where suburban 'swing' voters are found. Will the new rhetoric attract back some of America's non-voters? </p> <p>Gore's new tack also risks reopening the question - already asked by Bush at almost every campaign stop - of who Gore really is and what he really believes. Gore's speeches may be full of specifics about education, health care, and Social Security, but it's not clear what they add up to. Is he a New Democrat? An old Democrat? A born-again Populist? </p> <p>As noted, the new theme seems to have nothing to do with Gore's history. It's even at odds with his chosen running mate, Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who's voting record is to the right of most Democrats. Lieberman is also pro-business, he's the current head of the Democratic Leadership Council, and he's one of the Senate's largest benefactors of contributions from the insurance and health-care industries. </p> <p>It's not clear whether Gore's post-convention 'bounce' has had anything to do with his new old-Democrat theme, anyway. Polls show he gained only 2 percentage points among men, statistically insignificant. But he gained 16 per cent of women. And it's a fair bet that what women liked most - in addition to Gore's obviously genuine affection for his wife (America is still talking about the prolonged kiss he gave Tipper after her introduction of him, probably the most notorious Public Display of Affection in American political history) - was his unbridled support for abortion rights and for equal pay for women. (Bush and the Republicans are negative on both.) Women didn't flock to Gore because of his new-found populism. </p> <p>But not to worry. There's plenty of time between now and the debates for Gore to measure the benefits of his new message against its potential risks, and make whatever adjustments seem necessary. And you can be sure he will. No modern American politician thinks more carefully before he acts than Albert Gore, Jr.</p>",
  "<p>If you thought the internet was just another big boy's toy, offering endless hours of pleasure to nerds in anoraks, think again. The web in Britain is soon to be dominated by women. New research forecasts that the number of female users will exceed the number of male surfers next summer. </p> <p>And there will be millions of them. By the middle of 2001, half of the population will regularly have some internet access, says the Future Foundation think tank. </p> <p>Only five years ago, three times as many men as women were regular surfers, and the total number of users of both genders together represented less than 10 per cent of this country's male population. Women's new internet enthusiasm has shocked analysts. </p> <p>However, the explosion in female internet use has brought disappointment for tens of thousands who thought the net promised a 'cyber-feminist' revolution, linking women across the world to discuss politics and access the zeitgeist. Instead, the battle for internet equality appears to have been fought almost solely to visit shopping and horoscope sites. </p> <p>Britain's three most high profile websites for women are entirely lifestyle-based. <a href=\"http://www.beme.com\"> beme.com</a> is typical. This weekend it enables you to catch up on 'gadget gossip', or engage in its latest discussion: 'Bi-curious - any suggestions on how?'. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Charlottestreet.com\">Charlottestreet.com</a> is another big hitter, offering one woman's pregnancy diary or the chance to 'win six months of chocolate'. </p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.handbag.com\">handbag.com</a> you can plan how to cook tomorrow's bank holiday lunch, and find an answer to the tortured dilemma of how to wax your boyfriend's back. </p> <p>'It's gone back to the time when Nike thought marketing to women meant making shoes in pink,' said the foundation's Melanie Howard. 'A lot of internet content providers did exactly that.' </p> <p>Yet only three years ago a cult British book predicted that women's networking and social skills, ideally suited to computer use, would transform their horizons. Sadie Plant, author of the best-selling Zeros and Ones, said Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, had worked on the 'first computer', basing it on the design of a weaving machine. </p> <p>In the United States, still the promised land of the cyber-friendly, women internet users already outnumber male surfers. But there, too, the content they access is not what people once hoped for from a 'womenweb world'. </p> <p>The most visited US 'women's sites' are pampers.com, avon.com and oilofolay.com. Those established with a commitment to women's issues fail to attract subscribers or advertisers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.women.com\"> Women.com</a>, launched in 1993, is typical of the survivors. It promised frank, intelligent information and discussion to 'sassy' female surfers. But its staff acknowledge that most of its daily hits are now from people wanting sex tips and horoscopes. </p> <p>Editor Judy Coyne said: 'I don't think that necessarily there's been some big change of feminist philosophy over how to put the site together, but as it grows it encompasses a lot more things. A lot of women from different backgrounds and education levels are interested in certain kinds of content.' </p> <p>A string of American businesswomen have left sites they founded with high ideals. At <a href=\"http://www.oxygen.com\"> oxygen.com</a>, started two years ago, women were promised a 'media revolution' on a cable television channel and a host of websites with a hip sensibility. The sites on offer are now largely bought in from TV shows. Last month oxygen editor-in-chief Sarah Bartlett resigned, followed shortly after by five colleagues. </p> <p>'The reason the early days of the web seemed so promising of a feminist publishing revolution was that the choir was singing to itself,' says American internet writer Janelle Brown. 'These days the web is a mass medium. Finding fluff on women's websites is like shooting fish in a barrel. The best way to please shareholders is to pander to the lowest common denominators of celebrities and beauty tips.' </p> <p>The foundation's Howard, however, insists: 'It's still very early days in Britain. There's simply been an over-expectation of what people can achieve. </p> <p>'There's been revulsion that the internet is being trivialised for women. Providers still don't properly understand what women want. In the long term they'll become much more sophisticated.'</p>",
  "'Everyone has a right to life; so why should we kill one our daughters to enable the other to survive.' This was part of the submission in which the parents of Jodie and Mary, the Siamese twins, refused permission for them to be separated, thus condemning both of them to an early death. <p>The claim that everyone has a right to life is not unfamiliar. It was, for example, the basis on which the parents of the notorious child B founded their attack on the local heath authority who refused to pay for further surgery on a child whom they though unable to survive it. The assertion of a right is always more persuasive when it is made on behalf of someone unable to speak for themselves. But there is no law entitling a foetus to life at the expense of her mother, nor entitling a new-born baby to life at the expense of her conjoined sister. So the right evoked must be a moral not a legal right, claimed under a moral principle, not a legal instrument. The complexity of this case is precisely to formulate the moral principle involved. </p> <p>The parents, Roman Catholics, invoke God's will and they will probably argue that it is God's will that everyone equally has a right to life. All are equally God's children, so equality of treatment on the twins is the paramount moral imperative. After all, they, and God love them equally; and so both must die. </p> <p>The doctors involved in the case, and the judge, regarded the saving of one life, which, given skilled surgery will probably be normal and relatively problem free has a more moral significance than the saving of the other life which could never be other than brief and totally dependent on her sister to support it. Without heart or lungs, the baby Mary could hardly be though of as a separate human being, and her dependence on her sister would ultimately destroy that potentially normal life. So the judge, and probably the majority of the medical profession, came down on the side of separation, and the immediate destruction of the life of Mary. They saw it as the saving of a life which would otherwise have been lost. </p> <p>Is this a decision with which we, as a society, should be satisfied? I believe that it is. But there is one aspect of it which is of great importance. Broadly, it is a decision of a secular society, unwilling to take seriously the religious scruples of the parents. This is a factor in the case which we cannot disregard, and which, I believe, should be examined more closely. For it is too readily assumed that the religious and the secular cannot communicate that they will always be on opposite sides in issues of life and death. Those who believe, for example, in the immortal souls of Mary and Jodie, which have been in God's hands and will be in God's hands for all eternity, are more indifferent to death than those who think that the saving of a life is of paramount importance. There is a parallel here with the case of Jehovahs Witnesses who used to be able to refuse, on doctrinal grounds, blood transfusions for their children whose lives depended on the procedure. It now seems that they have relaxed their principles, recognising perhaps that there is a consensus against them. </p> <p>The fact, I think, is that the religious and the secular are not necessarily so deeply at odds with one another as one perceived. There are those who, without repudiating religion, are capable of taking a developmental or biological view of human life. According to this view Mary's life would hardly be regarded as the life of a human being, let alone one with an immortal soul. It would more plausibly be regarded as an assemblage of human tissues that would never result in a human person, and the removal of which from Jodie could be regarded as analogous to the removal of a tumour, an unwanted and destructive growth of cells, which are undoubtedly human cells, and alive, but are nevertheless not and never will be a human being. Religion will eventually adapt itself to this view of human life, just as, in the past, it adapted itself to the Copernican Revolution, and the principles of Newtonian physics. It will so adapt because the human need for religion will not go away. But neither will the human desire to understand and manage the universe around it. </p> <p>There still remains, however, the issue of the extent to which the combined forces of medicine and the law are entitled to overrule the moral and religion convictions of the parents of a child. (I leave on one side the particular situation of these parents and these children, who were immigrants from a foreign country, and subject to the laws of this country only in as far as they had taken up temporary residence here, for their children to have the best chance of being born alive). </p> <p>There are two issues here: the faith that we place in the knowledge and experience of doctors, and the degree to which we believe that the law based on a moral consensus from which particular and personal moral principles may not divert. As for the first, it seems to me to be a recipe for disaster if our faith in medical knowledge and experience is so eroded that we can never say that 'the doctor knows best'. It is generally bad news for the patient if his treatment has to depend as much on his own choice as on the superior knowledge of his doctor. The medical profession has become so fearful of litigation that it sometimes incapable of giving advice on purely professional matters on which the patient ('or customer') can have no informed views. Judges, mercifully, remain more dictatorial, more ready to fulfil their function which is to give a judicial decision, whether or not it is in accord with what the lay person who appears before them may want. But judges (and I believe doctors as well) are not outside the scope of morality. They may not share the private moral views of those whose cases they are considering (in this case the religious scruples of the parents of the twins). </p> <p>But it is their duty to take into account the general and public morality of the society they serve. They must also take into account the peculiarly fraught circumstances of the people whose case they are considering. Everyone who has ever had a baby knows the state of acute emotional sensitivity that follows a birth. One cannot see even a kitten or a puppy, let alone a human baby, without feeling near tears of sympathy with this new life. How could it be possible for the mother of Mary and Jodie, far more than normally traumatised to make a sensible long term decision about her daughter, only 18 days after their birth? Morality undoubtedly depends as much on feeling as on reason. Yet, in the realm of public morality it is necessary to weigh reason against sentiment, and to see how precedent and general policy will be affected by a particular and emotionally charged decision. I believe that Mr Justice Johnston was right and I hope that the Official Solicitor, representing those who cannot speak for themselves, will not appeal against his judgement. And later, if all goes well can we really suppose that Jodie the surviving daughter will not be loved and cherished by her parents, as the happy outcome of God's will? </p> <p>\u0095 Lady Mary Warnock is a crossbench life peer, moral philosopher and author of the Intelligent Person's Guide to Morals</p>",
  "Although I am very happy to be back in Britain after three years, I have hardly been rejoicing. Failing intervention by the Attorney-General, I expect to appear in court soon facing possible imprisonment for breaching the Official Secrets Act. <p>But the real criminals in this affair are the British Government and the intelligence services. The Government has a duty to uphold the law. It cannot simply be ignored because crimes are carried out by friends of the Government. </p> <p>In November 1999, I sent the Home Secretary Jack Straw detailed evidence of involvement by MI6 officers in a plot to murder Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. Although the assassination failed when attempted in 1996, innocent Libyan civilians were killed. </p> <p>In a dossier I presented to Mr Straw, I included the names of those who had also been briefed about the plot within MI5. Mr Straw merely indicated to journalists in off-the-record briefings that he was 'looking into the matter'. Robin Cook labelled my evidence 'pure fantasy', an assertion now contradicted by an MI6 report posted on the Internet last February. </p> <p>When presented with this compelling evidence these very senior Ministers should, of course, have called in the police immediately. We would never countenance two police officers conspiring to murder a criminal. Why should we accept that two MI6 officers could do the same to Colonel Gaddafi? </p> <p>This week, I will be writing to both the police and the Crown Prosecution Service asking them to investigate the role of the Government in this case. As part of any inquiry, Special Branch would have to have unfettered access to Government discussions about my case. Should the Government frustrate this process, it would lay itself open to accusations of either obstructing or perverting the course of justice. And what has Sir Stephen Lander, now head of MI5, done to protect the reputation of the organisation he runs? </p> <p>When I joined MI5, I was told it obeyed the law and always had the utmost respect for civil liberties. So inevitably I am left wondering why Sir Stephen did not perform his clear public duty and call in Special Branch to investigate the Gadaffi plot as soon as he realised that MI6 did not have Ministerial authorisation to plot to assassinate a foreign head of state. In August 1998, I also pointed out publicly that MI5 had evidence of the plot on its file SF754-0168. </p> <p>Sir Stephen is, sadly, a man who keeps quiet about crimes committed by MI6 but stands by while a properly-motivated whistleblower is persecuted. I fear he has already connived in misleading the Government over MI5's failure to prevent an IRA attack on the British mainland in 1993, a matter I will seek to have disclosed at my forthcoming trial. </p> <p>The Government's failure to ensure that two MI6 officers are brought to justice for their part in planning a murder is what I would expect of despots and dictators. It is not only an abuse of power. It is an insult to those who respect the rule of law, including the vast majority of the British public. </p> <p>It is corruption. It is sleaze. And sleaze was where New Labour came in as a supposed breath of fresh air after the Conservatives had grown corrupt. </p> <p>The Attorney General's office is still determined to prosecute the editor of Punch magazine early next month for claiming that institutional failures in the intelligence services failed to prevent the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1993. That was the biggest terrorist attack on the British mainland in history. </p> <p>This all contrasts remarkably with the attitude taken towards former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson. After alleging impropriety in the intelligence services to the Sunday Times in 1996, he was the beneficiary of an immunity deal which saw him receiving a substantial sum of taxpayers' money and help in finding a new job in return for future silence. </p> <p>This tragic episode is fast becoming British Watergate. Until Nixon was exposed, the American public was generally prepared to tolerate some secrecy surrounding the work of government because they trusted their elected representatives. But our Ministers should not forget that once their president had been impeached, Americans were no longer prepared to take that government on trust. As a consequence, the American people have now won the most liberal freedom of information policy in the world. Dumb commentators still suggest glibly that 'secrets must remain secret'. That argument is an affront to the public's right to know how our intelligence services operate on their behalf. Secrecy and the ludicrous legislation which props it up is inimical to freedom of expression. </p> <p>These naive commentators do not have the wit or intelligence to realise that they undermine the proper ability of the press to hold the most secretive and unaccountable areas of government up to public scrutiny. If people want to live in a country where the intelligence services work in absolute secrecy with no respect for the rule of law or basic human rights, they should go and live in Libya, Iraq or Iran. </p> <p>As the head of Britain's intelligence services, Tony Blair now has a simple - and honourable - choice. To expose the truth. My message to the servants of the state remains simple. Don't shoot the messenger. Don't let MI6 get away with murder. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/shayler\">Special report: David Shayler</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/freedom\">Special report: freedom of information</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.mi5.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">MI5</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmbills/005/2000005.htm\" target=\"_new\">Freedom of information bill</a></p>",
  "When David Shayler appeared on Have I Got News For You last year, Paul Merton showed that alternative humour which has made him a millionaire by delivering the Wildean jibe that Shayler was a fatty bozo. Even the Telegraph could not produced wit to match this. In retrospect, Shayler's stock had nowhere to head but up. <p>He was thanked by strangers in the street for his sacrifices when he returned from exile last week. The greetings were delivered in Beaconsfield, which was not known previously as a Little Moscow of the Buckinghamshire red belt. The newspapers agreed that the tide was with Shayler. They reported the Government had ducked an Official Secrets Act prosecution against him for revealing his most damming secrets - MI6's definite knowledge of and alleged complicity in a coup attempt in Libya, and MI5's lazy handling of warnings of the bombing of the Israeli Embassy which led to the building being wrecked and the probable unjust conviction of two Palestinians. Rather than take the serious charges head on, the authorities had gone for Shayler for the laughably petty crime of telling the Mail on Sunday that MI5 kept files on politicians. </p> <p>As the politicians were Peter Mandelson and Jack Straw, two of the most conservative figures in the history of the Labour movement, I can see why many think the case will be far funnier than Have I Got News For You has been since those forgotten days when Merton had to struggle on a mere upper-middle-class income. The argument doing the rounds is that MI5 will end up being derided as a collection of numpties whatever happens. If Mandelson and Straw are real security threats, then Shayler was right to reveal the presence of traitors at the heart of Government. If they are not, and they quite clearly are not, then Shayler revealed nothing except the dangerous fantasies of a far-right secret police. </p> <p>I'm all for laughing at the spooks, but mockery can let them off too lightly. Straw is meant to be the Minister who controls MI5. Mandelson has to deal daily with its bureaucrats in Northern Ireland. They are members of a government which determines the budgets and powers of MIs 5 and 6. How are they likely to behave when they learn that they have been spied on for years after they left the Left by the wizened, vindictive souls of the 'intelligence community'? </p> <p>The best answer comes from fiction. Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel, All the King's Men, about the politics of the American South has just been re-published. It has a corrupt politician telling his sidekick, the narrator, to find the dirty secret of a judge who has got ideas above his station. </p> <p>'\"But suppose there isn't anything to find?\" </p> <p>'And the Boss said: \"There is always something.\" </p> <p>'And I said: \"Maybe not on the Judge.\" </p> <p>'And he said: \"Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something.\"' </p> <p>Quite so. Successive American presidents allowed J. Edgar Hoover to ignore the rise of a Mafia and persecute civil rights campaigners because they were terrified about what he had on them in his files. There is at least a suggestion that New Labour politicians are being told to watch what they say. </p> <p>In March, Peter Hain, the Foreign Office Minister, bravely deplored the prosecution of my colleague Martin Bright for fighting MI5's attempts to find the sources of our articles on the Shayler case. Within days, the Times and Telegraph were reporting that the Conservatives had 'revealed' that Hain was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and, as such, was unfit to represent Britain. It is impossible to decide whether this was a warning from the secret state to a democratic politician not to get ideas above his station. I wouldn't dream of speculating myself - no responsible citizen wants to be accused of being a conspiracy theorist, after all. Yet it is indisputable that Robin Cook was lied to quite spectacularly when MI6 told him Shayler's Libyan accusations were 'pure fantasy'. </p> <p>As far as we know no official has been investigated for allegedly deceiving the Ministers who are meant to control them. Being a cynical Leftie, I think New Labour would have given the most bigoted factions in the security services everything they wanted without the need for threats. Those Pollyannas among you who believe in the democratic respectability of our system have no choice, however, but to regard Shayler's allegations about the files as the most serious charges of constitutional impropriety he has levelled.</p>",
  "<p>Bleepleepleepleepleepleepleep </p> <p>Needless to say I can't quite hear myself think for the noise when my wife comes dashing in from being in the middle of trying to repair a puncture with two dessert spoons wondering how she's supposed to get anything done round here when the first sign of our ridiculous new so-called variable-browning-control toaster from Argos actually doing what it says on the box is when the smoke alarm starts screeching the house down. </p> <p>'Are you sure you read the instructions?' I ask.</p> <p>'There's something wrong with it,' she says.</p> <p>'But have you read the instructions?'</p> <p>She wafts at the alarm with a telephone directory until the bleeping stops. She is now officially red in the face. 'Look. Number four leaves it completely white, number eight sets it on fire and everything in between only toasts one side. Why should you need instructions? It's a toaster, not a nuclear'</p> <p>She leaves me to fill in the blank. Reactor? Submarine? Family?</p> <p>Obviously I'd like to stop and pretend to take an interest but it's the rabbit's birthday and as a special treat the eldest and I are supposed to be taking him for his annual jab in the neck. We drive off, leaving my wife opening the windows and doors and trying to persuade everyone to have muesli.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, the boy and I are holding Lucky against his will on the surgery table. 'What does he eat?' says the vet, poking about in his mouth. 'Rabbit food,' says our 11-year-old.</p> <p>The vet is a bit worried about Lucky's molars. She says we have to make sure he eats the green pellets. She's a bit worried about his testicles, which may harbour subcutaneous myxomatosis. She's a bit worried about his rectal corridor in case flies get up there and lay eggs. She's a bit worried about his ears in case he gets them caught in a combine harvester.</p> <p>'He seems healthy enough,' I say. Admittedly I'm thinking about the unnerving way he suddenly starts vigorously practising his otherwise redundant sexual technique on his plastic football in front of the children, though come to think of it, I suppose even this might cast doubts on his powers of observation, notwithstanding the old carrot joke that you never see a rabbit wearing glasses. And, OK, you can't expect the little furry chap to know what a member of the opposite gender looks like if he's never seen one, but you'd think he'd know it would have ears at least, and that a regular sphere rolling away from him may be merely following the dictates of physics and not necessarily playing hard to get. </p> <p>On the upside, he does get three shags a day without anyone nagging him about the state of the hutch. </p> <p>I decide not to mention it to the vet. I'd hate to give her something else to worry about. 'If you could just check his bottom every morning,' she says. </p> <p>I pay the bill, which has a pound off for paying in cash and another pound for not asking why it costs so much.</p> <p>'Dad, can we buy a present for Lucky?' says the boy on the way back. He knows someone who bought his dog an edible birthday card. So we stop off at Tesco to see if we can't find him a little treat, but everything is for dogs and cats - rubber mice, tartan flea collars, Bob Martin's range of novelty worming products - and in the end we have to choose between a box of nourishing Snack-stix and a salmon-flavour hairball remedy. On the way out I pick up a form telling you how you can save pounds on legal bills by insuring your pet against running in front of a car, which might then crash into a lamppost, causing whiplash injuries or death to the occupants.</p> <p>We arrive home to discover that my wife has been to Argos and back and is plugging in a replacement variable-browning-control toaster. 'How's the rabbit?' she asks, following us out to the run, where Lucky is giving his ball a good seeing to.</p> <p>'Er the vet says you have to check his bottom for maggots.' </p> <p>'Check his bottom for WHAT?' she says with a look of mounting horror.</p> <p>Bleepleepleepleepleepleepleep</p> <p>'Ah,' I say, 'that must be for me.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:phil.hogan@observer.co.uk\">phil.hogan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>We took a big but calculated risk when we opted to give LWT's television cameras almost total access to Easyjet staff and passengers in mid-1998. As a rapidly growing young airline there were obviously going to be certain things that we didn't want to be shown on prime-time ITV. </p> <p>Easyjet is not unique in suffering from the occasional delay or angry passenger and not all airline staff get out of bed on the right side. But only Easyjet staff have a television crew with them for eight or nine months of the year. </p> <p>The business rationale is simple: we don't sell through travel agents, so all our customers have to come to us - 70 per cent to our website and the rest to our call centre. Therefore we have to find as many ways as possible of keeping the Easyjet brand name in front of the consumer. We spend millions of pounds on press and poster advertising each year but nothing on television, so the Airline series provides us with a useful way of getting ourselves onto the screens. </p> <p>During the first series we specifically rostered more staff to work in our call centre - and during the breaks we received hundreds of calls asking if we fly to Pakistan, the US etc. </p> <p>But there is a price. Hundreds of people are quick to contact us to complain if they do not like something they saw on the show. In the most recent series, we have been affected by a number of delays which are completely beyond our control - snow, fog, air traffic problems etc. However, we believe that, overall, the series is positive as a brandbuilding exercise. </p> <p>People sometimes ask me why I have allowed a certain scene to be shown. Simple: we have no editorial control. A team of peo ple from different parts of the company - airport operations, cabin crew, flight deck, public relations etc - views each and every episode before it is broadcast, but our scope for making changes is extremely limited. We have had enough battles with LWT over content to know that if it is not related to matters of personal safety or security then we are wasting our breath. </p> <p>And that is the way it should be. We do not always agree with LWT over what constitutes good television, but our expertise is in running an airline - not in programme-making. And the number of people who regularly tune in to watch the series is a testament to the fact they know what they're doing. </p> <p>The latest series has attracted an average of 7.5 million people every Friday night at 9pm - or around 37 per cent of the viewing public and about twice the number of people who tuned in to watch the new Friends . The only programme that has done better in that slot in the last two years has been Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? </p> <p>In light of this, it is not surprising that we have agreed to LWT's requests for another series - for broadcast in early 2001. We are also heading towards a partial flotation in the last quarter of the year - having that on camera should be interesting. </p> <p>But when I stop to consider the series, I always come back to a single principle. Most of the traditional airlines would have too much to lose by letting in the cameras; but would our competitors in the low-cost market be prepared to do so? I think they probably would, and for that reason, we will welcome the cameras back sometime later this month. </p>",
  "<p><strong> Thunderstruck </strong> Traverse </p> <p><strong> Voices</strong> Traverse </p> <p><strong> Hopeless Games</strong> Komedia@Southside </p> <p><strong> War of the Worlds</strong> Royal Lyceum </p> <p><strong> Cabin Pressure</strong> Royal Lyceum </p> <p>The most audacious show that has been produced at the Traverse during the Festival is Thunderstruck. It's not the most perfectly shaped: the dramatist Daniel Danis and the Canadian theatre group One Yellow Rabbit have made a mini-saga out of an incident. But it's shot through with an original weirdness. </p> <p>It has invented a wild eloquence for its characters, who speak of terror in childlike accents. It has an unnerving appearance; none of its movements are predictable. Its staging and its vocabulary are all of one unsettling piece. </p> <p>A wooden timber-frame topped with a weathercock serves as the outline of a backwoods cabin in which three brothers and their sister are orphaned when a bolt of lightning strikes. Later, wheeled across the stage, this very unstable home becomes a cage. </p> <p>The brothers, who are eerily similar with identical boiler-suits and synchronised gestures, which can break into a hillbilly hoe-down, pop their sister into this. They guard her, they display her, and they abuse her. A 'red, red clot' on her brain has changed her from a talented country singer - a dimpling figure in gingham and glitter who swishes her petticoats as the audience enters - to an unresponsive body who is strung up in her brothers' harness like a piece of wet washing. Care can be a prison, the play suggests. </p> <p>A Dutch company is responsible for the most surprising theatrical coup of the Festival. Under the direction of Johan Simons, Jeroen Willems's one-man show is an intricate and scalding denunciation of the free market. </p> <p>The text of Voices is taken from statements by Pier Paolo Pasolini and the chairman of Shell International. Its manner shifts startlingly. Five bigwigs are portrayed with an intense realism which could be rivalled only by Johns Fortune and Bird. But every so often this realism is disturbed by a vein of grotesque fantasy, of Fellini-like extravagance. </p> <p>Set around an opulent but dishevelled dinner table, Voices opens with some donnish reflections - delivered by a crumpled, hesitant figure who sidles into the theatre as if by accident, with his napkin stuffed into his collar - on how to survive the loss of humanist belief. </p> <p>It goes on to include a drag act, a detailed dissection of one man's wolfish smile, a story about meeting the Devil, a wordless episode when Willems's tongue gets completely out of control and behaves like a terrible sea-serpent, and a defence of the ethics of multinationals. 'Reality doesn't have interruptions,' declares Willems's first character. The skill of Voices is to pick this notion apart - and then to prove it true. </p> <p>To watch Hopeless Games is to see mood-setting images, normally glimpsed out of the corner of an eye, invading the centre of the stage. It is like seeing something subterranean rise to the surface of a pond. </p> <p>This sequence of danced stories - the result of a wordless collaboration between the Do theatre of St Petersburg and the Fabrik company from Potsdam - begins with a headless squat overcoat waddling across the stage, as if tugged by the balloon it carries. It proceeds with a coat-rack writhing into many-limbed life, and interlaces its doleful acrobatic sequences with video footage. Framed by the lashes of an enormous eye, a train is seen rushing towards the audience and the band of (mostly shaven-headed) performers. As fireworks burst across the screen, the form of their bodies disappear under the patterns of exploding flowers. The melancholic images in Hopeless Games are memorable: they should be harnessed to a story, not left evocatively wafting. After Edinburgh, the show tours England, Europe and Ireland. </p> <p>You'd think it would be almost impossible to make a dull play out of the performances - biographical and cinematic - of Orson Welles. But the Siti Company, New York has managed it with War of the Worlds. Setting their investigation in front of a big silver-framed screen, they've come up with a horde of clangingly obvious formulations about the director's art - 'magic' features largely. </p> <p>The acting is so wooden that for a long time you suspect parody. As Welles, Stephen Webber bellows expressionlessly or sonorously intones. When period flavour is required, an actress flings herself on to the stage, shrieks and throws her beads and arms into the air. Every time a phrase by Welles or a description of his work is quoted, it serves as a criticism of what's being seen. 'Depth of field and sharpness of focus' enthuses one fan: this piece is shallow and fuzzy. </p> <p>The same company has produced Cabin Pressure, an inert examination of the idea that 'being an audience is a creative act' which reduces its watchers to stunned passivity. The piece was conceived by Anne Bogart, who has brought together snatches from a number of plays - the warring couples from Private Lives and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? share a stage - and added a number of quotations from theatrical sages. She has mixed in some dull audience reactions to one performance - one person says it was pretty, another didn't feel very comfortable - which are repeated with minor variations throughout the evening. </p> <p>She has also set up some would-be provocative stagings. As the audience settle into their seats, a scene is in full flood. From time to time the lights go on and off in the auditorium, while the actors continue to perform. Occasionally the performers are seen as if from backstage. </p> <p>To have any point at all, this should influence audience behaviour. It didn't. The performance was accompanied by the customary cross rustle of macs from walk-outs, but when a mobile phone went off, people shushed its owner as if it were an interruption, when surely it should have been deemed an act of creative participation? One day, declares one of the actors in Cabin Pressure, 'an audience will rise to its feet and say who do you think we are?' Let's hope so.</p>",
  "<p>' Hell-oh,' says Ren\u00e9e Zellweger primly. For a native of Texas, a state where everything is bigger, including the vowels, the clipped accent comes as a surprise. There is a reason for it, of course. Zellweger is playing Bridget Jones in the film adaptation of Helen Fielding's bestselling diary. She's been living in London, practising the Queen's English 12 hours a day, from the moment she leaves her Kensington flat to the minute her driver drops her back at bedtime. </p> <p>Zellweger is off-duty, so her speech patterns should have reverted back to a Southern drawl. But the vestiges of the crash-course phonetics (courtesy of voice coach Barbara Berkery, who tutored Gwyneth Paltrow) cannot be erased that easily. Zellweger happily goes into great detail about the mechanics of an English accent (it's all about vowel sounds and diphthongs, apparently). She'll tell you, too, how talking like a native helps her avoid being ripped off by xenophobic cabbies. </p> <p>'It's become a habit,' she says. 'Now I wake up and I talk like that, and I answer the telephone like that and when I go out, I go out like that.' </p> <p>An English accent, of course, is imperative for the role of Bridget Jones. Doubly so given the almighty fuss in the press when it was announced that this petite Texan missy - not Kate, not Helena, nor any one of a dozen other British actresses - had been chosen to play the nation's favourite Chardonnay-swilling singleton. </p> <p>'The criticism has been hurtful,' concedes Zellweger (speaking Texan now). 'Not the bit about the fact that an American girl is playing this part. I can understand that. But it's the extremes to which it's taken. They'll slip something else in there like, \"Nobody has even heard of her before\"; \"What's she ever done?\"; \"The unknown Texan comic\". That's hurtful, d'ya know?' </p> <p>Whoever branded her an 'unknown' clearly didn't see her in the romantic comedy Jerry Maguire. As Tom Cruise's love interest, her performance helped the film to take $240m at the box office. Since then, Zellweger not only commands $3m a picture, she has also found herself, with current partner Jim Carrey (star of The Truman Show ), half of an A-list couple. </p> <p>Today she's taking a break from Bridget. She's at the Dorchester Hotel to publicise Me, Myself &amp; Irene , directed by the Farrelly brothers, which has also enjoyed an exceptional run at the US box office - $88m and rising. Fresh-faced and prone to giggles - she has a habit of burying her face in her hands with mock wails of embarrassment - she seems younger than her 31 years. She explains how her relationship with Jim Carrey was kindled during the filming of Me, Myself &amp; Irene . Though wary of it sounding like a tacky on-set fling, it was not, she insists, where they met. 'We have business associates in common and a couple of mutual friends, so I'd known about him and said hello and things for a long time, and then met him a couple of years ago at a dinner party. So I'd known him for a while.' </p> <p>The consensus among US critics is that Me, Myself &amp; Irene has not merely out-grossed the Farrellys' previous films, but 'out-grossed' them too, making the toilet humour of There's Something About Mary seem like good clean family fun. 'Whether it becomes offensive depends largely on what your intentions are,' says Zellweger. 'They [the Farrelly brothers] are kind-hearted people. They don't tell these jokes with malicious intent.' </p> <p>Carrey plays a policeman with a Jekyll and Hyde syndrome, each half of his split personality having designs on Irene (Zellweger), the girl who's in his custody on a cross-country trip. No subject is beyond ridicule - bodily functions, black midgets, albino waiters, dead cows. </p> <p>Her parents have seen the film, but she hasn't had a response from them yet ('I warned them, but they were looking forward to it,' she laughs). It's harmless fun, she insists. 'And anyway, it's refreshing to move in a different direction and try something new.' However, not everyone is as amused. In the States, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) has objected, claiming the film makes light of schizophrenia. </p> <p>Next week, Zellweger can also be seen in another black comedy, Nurse Betty, co- starring Morgan Freeman. She plays a psychologically disturbed woman who, following the murder of her husband, becomes obsessed with a soap star. One of the central themes is the question of celebrity, and given that her own life has changed considerably over the past three years, this has great resonance for Zellweger - especially now that she's dating Carrey. </p> <p>She can understand the attention, she says, especially in Carrey's case, because 'he makes so many people happy'. Nonetheless, the Carrey liaison has brought intense scrutiny, making the couple very defensive, especially as Carrey is known as a serial dater of his female co-stars. (Carrey dismisses the snide comments: 'The fact is you live where you live, you work where you work, and a lot of people meet their significant other at work.') </p> <p>'It's strange,' she says. 'I have a very difficult time justifying the attention sometimes. So much so that I play down everything, even the good things. It was actually my New Year's resolution to enjoy myself more. But yeah, I have a very difficult time justifying it. You go down a carpet and people scream your name and clap. For what? Because you're lucky ? You know, I'm lucky. I get to do what I love to do and make a living at it, and that's pretty extraordinary.' </p> <p> Ren\u00e9e Zellweger was born in Katy, Texas, a pit-stop on the highway 30 miles west of Houston. She has a Norwegian mother and a Swiss father, hence the unwieldy surname, which, in a previous Hollywood age, would have been the first thing to go. Emil Zellweger, an engineer, spent his formative years in Australia. When he met Kjellfrid Irene, a nurse whose work took her to Texas, he decided to follow. Ren\u00e9e and her older brother grew up in Austin, the state capital. Her parents no longer live there - they moved to Florida - but it's still very much where Zellweger's heart lies. </p> <p>At the University of Texas, she studied drama merely as a supplement to her journalism course, but it wasn't long before it became a passion. She took the usual route through local stagework, commercials, then low-budget films. Her first was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it bit in local director Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused (1993), regarded as something of a slacker classic. Then came Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation , which lay hidden for four years, released only to cash in on Jerry Maguire . In both those films she appeared with fellow Texan and struggling actor, Matthew McConaughey. It was fortuitous. McConaughey tipped her off about a part in a bargain-basement, Natural Born Killers knock-off called Love and a .45 , and Zellweger won cult raves as Starlene, the white and trashy murderer on the run. </p> <p>In 1995, Zellweger moved to Hollywood, working in a bar while taking small parts in films like Empire Records and Reality Bites until she won her first lead, opposite Vincent D'Onofrio in The Whole Wide World, the story of comic-book writer Robert E Howard. </p> <p>And then came something that can only be described as a Ren\u00e9e Zellweger speciality. While the obvious candidates were scratching each other's eyes out to star opposite Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire, Zellweger crept up on the inside. At the audition, barely believing she was in the same room as Cruise, things took an interesting turn when he improvised a drunken scene and fondled her breast. The stunt was designed to deter frailer applicants, but Zellweger kept her cool. And, ahead of bigger names - Patricia Arquette, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder - she bagged the part. Indeed, she fairly stole the picture, shining as Dorothy, the single mother who falls for Cruise. She played the part perfectly: naive yet world-weary, cute and lovable, but also sexy. </p> <p> Jerry Maguire 's writer/director Cameron Crowe admits that casting Zellweger opposite Cruise was a risk. But she brought what he calls 'that Billy Wilder, bittersweet romantic feeling, like Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment '. He goes as far as to put the success of the film down to Zellweger. 'Even with Tom being as great as he is in the movie, having someone not delivering on the reality level would have sunk the movie.' </p> <p>Despite the acclaim, Zellweger rejected high-profile offers in favour of a more eclectic mix of projects which, though hit and miss, have kept her career interesting. </p> <p>When it was announced in February that the role of the very British Bridget Jones would be going to an American, the newspapers had a field day. 'As Bridget approaches 40, she is to be played by a pert-breasted nymphet barely out of her teens,' said The Times . 'Of all the clunking, Hollywood idiocy. The only funny thing about Bridget Jones is that she's not young and perfect,' piled on The Evening Standard . 'Casting her as a young and perfect thing is like remaking The Elephant Man with Jude Law.' </p> <p>According to Jonathan Cavendish, producer of the film, the decision to go with Zellweger was not taken lightly. It was a two- year search to find the right actress. And though they met the obvious candidates ('all the people you'd expect us to look at'), it was Zellweger who knocked them out. </p> <p>'The problem with something that is so defined in terms of people's perception as the character of Bridget Jones is that we had a very clear idea of who we were looking for,' he explains. 'They had to be the person. When Ren\u00e9e walked into the room, Sharon [Maguire, the director] and I looked at one another and said, \"This is Bridget.\"' </p> <p>It makes marketing sense, too. Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill scored massively overseas courtesy of their American stars, Andie MacDowell and Julia Roberts. Bridget Jones is, effectively, the third instalment of a trilogy, made by the same gang (Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant, et al). Helen Fielding - who now lives in LA - has given Zellweger her blessing. As executive producer (not to mention a big mate of Curtis and Maguire's), she had a consultant role in casting ('She was kept very closely informed all the time,' says Cavendish). Fielding and Zellweger get on well (the author turned up on-set to hobnob recently). When Fielding appeared to criticise the project at a book function, Zellweger interpreted the comments as a joke. 'They ah sked her about this American girl, this actress being cast, and she said she was just upset that they hadn't ah sked her ,' says Zellweger, all Liza Dolittle again. 'Not that they hadn't ah sked her about casting, but that they hadn't ah sked her if she'd play Bridget Jones. That's what she meant.' 'Helen's been nothing but entirely supportive,' Cavendish asserts. </p> <p>However, bracing himself for the howls of indignation that would inevitably follow the announcement that the part had gone to an American, he insisted that Zellweger come to England for three months to perfect the accent and, importantly, 'to immerse herself in Bridget's world' by gaining real work experience in a London media office. </p> <p>And so, while Bridgetgate raged, Zellweger was merrily toiling away undercover as a trainee in the publicity offices of Picador, Fielding's publisher. There, she posed as Jonathan Cavendish's sister. And, for three weeks in April, the staff barely batted an eyelid as new girl 'Bridget Cavendish' kept hours of 9.30 till 5.30, answered phones, photocopied, went to meetings. Their only concern was that when asked to buy cakes for someone's birthday, she came back with \u00a3100-worth of hand-made tarts, paid for out of her own pocket. (In a similar act of generosity, Zellweger instantly won over the Bridget Jones film crew by ordering \u00a3400-worth of pizza.) </p> <p>'She really helped me because I was short-staffed. It wasn't just me doing whoever a favour,' insists Camilla Elworthy, head of publicity and the only one in on the secret. Indeed, Zellweger was so helpful that one of the senior publishers asked if Ms Cavendish would be interested in a full-time job. </p> <p>'I only had to take one person into my confidence,' says Elworthy. 'Somebody who I kept hearing saying to people, \"Doesn't Bridget look like that actress from Jerry Maguire .\" I said, \"That's because she is the girl from Jerry Maguire . Now please be quiet!\"' Though colleagues often wondered where Zellweger disappeared to at lunch-times (she was either meeting her voice coach or stuffing herself with pizza in a bid to put on a stone in weight for the role), and men were swatted away by Elworthy when their attentions became too amorous, no one else on the Picador staff twigged that Zellweger was an American, let alone a Hollywood star. </p> <p>And the cruel irony of the exercise? Part of the trainee's job was to go through the daily papers each morning, cutting out articles that pertained to any of Picador's books. There were, Bridget Cavendish found, many vitriolic tirades against an oddly named American actress, an 'unknown Texan comic'. 'Yeah, yeaaaaah,' she winces. 'I had to cut them out and file them as part of my job. I couldn't avoid it.' </p> <p>Zellweger smiles again. Next spring, when she comes back to do publicity, the British public will get their chance to determine whether she's pulled it off. </p> <p>'We'll see, I guess, won't we?' she chuckles. 'If I'm lynched and hanging off Tower Bridge, we'll see...'</p> <p>\u0095 Nurse Betty opens on 1 September, and Me, Myself &amp; Irene on 22 September</p>",
  "<p>It's not just US presidential hopefuls who are worried about the cinema's influence. The ChildCare Action Project, a stringent Christian group, appoints reviewers to trawl through Hollywood's detritus, guiding parents through their multiplex dilemmas. Its <a href=\"http://www.capalert.com\">Christian Analysis of American Culture</a> rates new releases often with reference to the Bible. Many recommendations are predictable, but others are surprising. Try to match the following comments to 10 recent well-known films... </p> <p><strong> 1 </strong> I'll not watch this movie again. I'll not watch the teen stripping to seduce a married man, and sensual dancing with self-touching to sexually arouse the married man. I'll not watch again the father hitting his teen son with his fist, the teen son dealing in drugs. Nor will I watch again the teen arrogance against parental authority, or the parents speaking to the teens with the same hate in their voice and words... I hope to not sit through trash like this again. </p> <p> <strong> 2</strong> At the beginning of the movie there was a great deal of nudity as [male lead] pranced nude through what appeared to be a mall. The nudity was so bold that as [male lead] spread his legs in one scene, the stretch of the tendons in his crotch was visible. In other scenes convenient objects were used to hide his genitalia - and only his genitalia. </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> There were 137 uses of the most foul of the foul words. This film actually beat South Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut in use of the most foul of the foul words. Also there were 71 uses of other three/four letter foul words plus 17 uses of God's name in vain. </p> <p> <strong> 4</strong> Many adventures and perils happen. Some of the adventures are not kid humour. For example, as [male lead] is ton ing up the characters with callisthenics, he leans back and cranes his neck to view the posterior of [female lead] while she is in an uncomplimentary position, who is dutifully offended by his rudeness. </p> <p> <strong> 5</strong> Through war and gladiatorial battles, the film presented floods of blood with incinerations, slicings, beheadings, stabbings, arrow and spear impalements, a hanging and incineration/crucifixion of a mother and her eight-year-old son (partially seen). Also of concern is the portrayal of lust for killing and the glorification of carnage. </p> <p> <strong> 6</strong> A most violent movie. At least 26 murders, one of which was the central 'bad guy' emptying his gun into the chest of the 'hero'. The bad guy was exceptional at expressing cold hatred and orgasmic lust for killing. The shooting of the hero is another issue for serious evaluation - he was resur rected from the dead by a kiss, no less. One character mocked our Lord by telling the hero he was '[his] own personal Jesus Christ'. </p> <p> <strong> 7</strong> A delightful movie made uncomfortable by ignominy. Though the movie was free of violence and murder, God's name in vain was there, too, once with the four-letter expletive. While there was no nudity, two couples were living together unmarried. Drugs to control sleep, presentation of failed marriage as routine, and a father's fianc\u00e9e making advances at his son disrupted an otherwise neat show. </p> <p> <strong> 8</strong> The central theme was about a bad girl's desire to kill dogs to get their coats. While many people seem to value their dogs more than humans, we cannot permit elevatation of the dog to human status. God gave us dominion over the beasts of the earth. If we were to elevate the dog to human status, we would be lowering the human to the dog level. </p> <p> <strong> 9</strong> There was some dialogue about the change which makes us put away childish things ['When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child...'] A refreshing though rare example of how the entertainment industry could be an effective tool for the betterment of the condition of childhood and general behaviour. </p> <p> <strong> 10</strong> This is a skin flick. And this was just the first 32 minutes of it. Repeated full female nudity. Inappropriate touching while undressed. Dressing to maximize the female form and exposure of it. Smoking dope and drug stupor with drunkenness were part of this unpleasant movie, too. </p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> American Beauty<br><strong> 2</strong> Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me<br><strong> 3</strong>The Blair Witch Project <strong> <br> 4 </strong> Chicken Run<br><strong> 5 </strong>Gladiator <br><strong>6 </strong>The Matrix <br> <strong> 7 </strong> You've Got Mail <br><strong>8 </strong>101 Dalmatians<br><strong> 9 </strong>Toy Story 2 <br><strong> 10 </strong> Eyes Wide Shut</p>",
  "<p>There can't be many people who have done both Bond movies and Ken Loach films. That Benicio del Toro is one, if not the only one, seems perfectly appropriate when you try to unravel his career. There is something weirdly elusive about him. </p> <p>His two most famous roles - as Fenster in The Usual Suspects and Dr Gonzo in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas - are the ones where he looks least like himself. His distinctive characteristic is a bizarre mumble that often makes it impossible to know what he's saying. </p> <p>When interviewed, he is equally cryptic, given to Cantonaesque pronouncements like: 'Today I'd describe myself as an alligator on a dry stone in a swampy everglade with the sun hitting his back trying to decide whether he should go into the water.' And he seems to float free ethnically: it was his idea to play Fenster as a 'white Chinese Puerto Rican Jew'. </p> <p>The one thing that is certain is that after a couple years away from the screen, we are going to be seeing a lot of del Toro. He's in Guy Ritchie's movie Snatch, alongside Brad Pitt, whose Latino twin he sometimes resembles. That will be followed by TheWay Of The Gun, directed by Usual Suspects writer Christopher McQuarrie. Plus that small part in Ken Loach's Bread And Roses. And soon after that, StevenSoderbergh's Traffic, co-starring Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones. </p> <p>Stripping away the confusion, del Toro was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico in 1967. He comes from a family of lawyers, and gets annoyed when people assume that just because he is Puerto Rican, he must have come from a poor background. After his mother died when he was nine, he was sent to boarding school in Pennsylvania. When he arrived at the University of California at San Diego he was planning to study business, but during his first year he switched to theatre. Before long he had dropped out completely to become an actor. </p> <p>By 1987 he was doing an episode of Miami Vice, followed a first movie role in Big Top Pee Wee, and then as a henchman to a Panamanian coke king in the lacklustre Dalton-era Bond Licence To Kill (1989). But had to wait until 1995 for The Usual Suspects to make people notice him. After that, he had two very good years: he picked up awards, he was excellent in Basquiat, and impressive in Abel Ferrara's The Funeral (both 1996). He seemed on the verge of mainstream stardom when Alicia Silverstone picked him as her co-star in Excess Baggage, but the film turned out to be a flop. </p> <p>Soon after came his extraordinary transformation into Dr Gonzo, the corpulent Samoan lawyer in Terry Gilliam's unfairly maligned version of Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Del Toro says he'll never get fat for a part again, but it paid off. The scene where maniacal Gonzo sits in the bath listening to Jefferson Airplane's White Rabbit is as horrifying as anything you'll ever see on film. Now he's back: forever hip, strange, incomprehensible. Too odd to be a big star, probably, but always an interesting presence.</p> <p><strong> Five things you should know about Benicio del Toro </strong></p> <p><strong> 1 </strong>He is often mistaken for an Italian. He's actually Puerto Rican</p> <p><strong> 2 </strong>Nicknames people have given him include Benny, Bene, Bueno, Bano, Bingo and Venus</p> <p><strong> 3 </strong>Che Guevara's widow approved of a plan to have Del Toro play her husband</p> <p><strong> 4</strong> His mother, his father, his uncle and his grandfather were all lawyers</p> <p><strong> 5</strong> He directed a short film, Submission, that was shown at the 1995 Venice Film Festival</p>",
  "<p><strong>Troublemaker: The Life &amp; History of A.J.P. Taylor</strong><br>Kathleen Burke<br>Yale \u00a319.95, pp491<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502448890,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>On Monday 12 August 1957, a small man in a three-piece suit and a bow tie walked on to the bare stage of what once had been a cinema, faced a TV camera and began talking. He talked continuously (as well as informatively and amusingly) for 30 minutes, ending on the stroke of the half hour. He then walked off, having made television history - and, one might say, having made history good television. </p> <p>A.J.P.Taylor was the best-known British historian of the twentieth century, and his television performances were what he was most widely known for. 'Performances' they certainly were, delivered without notes or autocue, defying the medium's inherent hunger for visual variety, engrossing an audience who half-wanted to see him fall off his high wire (he never did).</p> <p>For more than 15 years, these unprecedented, and still never emulated, one-man shows made serious history interesting to a whole variety of viewers who may have been bored by the subject at school, or who simply grew up in bookless households. Perhaps more than one spotty, earnest teenager was sufficiently intrigued, even if not persuaded, to pursue the interest at the local library (I can vouch for there having been at least one.) </p> <p>And that is what Taylor was so good at: interesting people in history, making it seem attractive, even fun. He published 23 books, a large number of essays, and the almost unbelievable number of 1,600 book reviews. Along the way he wrote about history and politics in the Manchester Guardian, about politics and history in the New Statesman, and about anything he fancied in the Sunday Express. </p> <p>In fact, from being an academic who did some reviewing and broadcasting on the side, Taylor really became, by mid career, a professional writer and 'media personality' who still continued to do a spot of teaching. Already by 1950 (when he was 44), his freelance income exceeded his university salary: it soon became more than three times greater. He effectively gave up his regular teaching post at Oxford in 1963 when he was elected to a 'Special Fellowship' at Magdalen. </p> <p>Given this extraordinary torrent of writing and speaking, we have to ask ourselves what it was that he had to say. His own answer was dispiriting: 'As I once wrote about Bernard Shaw, I had a great gift of expression and nothing to say.' It's a characteristically Taylorian remark in some ways. It contains some truth; it's doubly self-referential, since he is also citing his own writing; and it sacrifices measured judgement (about himself and Shaw) to the pleasures of epigrammatic exaggeration. </p> <p>Politically, his sympathies were with 'the people', but he mostly wrote about the rulers. Even in his own day, his taste for narrative diplomatic and political history came to seem old-fashioned, and there was certainly a danger that in Taylor's hands history did tend to become just one damned thing after another.</p> <p>The writing was attractive in the surface, all paradox and anecdote, yet in the end it could come to seem intellectually dull and even to convey a somewhat philistine view of the world. Ideas don't matter, culture doesn't matter much, even most people don't matter that much. Things happen; politicians respond; outcomes are unpredictable. A mild geo-political determinism played some part; cock-up and coincidence were allowed to account for the rest. </p> <p>Actually, it was never clear how seriously he took his own provocative views even in private matters. He apparently believed that 'prostate difficulties were caused by too much sex'; at least that's what he told his third wife-to-be, looking 'on the bright side' of a long period of celibacy. We are not told how this great narrative historian explained his needing a prostate operation 10 years later; another notch for the cock-up theory of history, perhaps? </p> <p>Kathleen Burke, who was Taylor's last graduate at Oxford and is now professor at University College, London, has written a book which admirably combines the engaging readability of the sympathetic biographer with the tough-minded analysis of the professional historian. There is the problem that an almost equally good and well-written book by Adam Sisman appeared only six years ago. </p> <p>If Burke's has the edge, it is partly because it is based on much more thorough archival research than is usual in a work of almost contemporary intellectual biography (Taylor seems to have taught his students good habits in this respect, even if he didn't teach himself). and partly because it is much more analytical on the books and the making of the extraordinary freelance career, though Sisman's may have more to say about aspects of Taylor's complex character and unhappy marriages. </p> <p>Burt liked, and still admires, Taylor, but her portrait is not a wart-free zone: 'He was basically indifferent to most people. He was conceited and self-righteous, self-absorbed and self-contained, insensitive and thoughtless.' At least that's how he was to his friends; being married to him could be worse. (Actually, 'self-righteous' doesn't really seem justified: he comes across as, on the whole, admirably free from moralistic self-justifying cant).</p> <p>He seems to have belonged to a type not altogether unknown to history, a man who wanted sex, wanted children, and wanted a housekeeper; marriage offered economies of scale. He didn't seem to want real intellectual companionship, or perhaps just didn't know how to get what he did want. </p> <p>The one companion to whom he was unswervingly faithful and attentive was his typewriter. Writing, as Burke nicely observes, was his 'primal urge', and it was a form of obsessive-compulsive behaviour which he was never able wholly to control. Most of his writing for the really popular press was tripe, and he knew it. He was exploiting his fluency and cashing in on his fame: after all, he had several families and a large ego to support. But along the way he managed to write quite a bit of really good history (The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, English History 1914-1945 ), several highly readable popular works, and an impressive number of skilful, thought-provoking reviews.</p> <p>Notoriously, he wrote in very short sentences. This was good for his journalism. It was not always good for his history. He liked to provoke. This was a weakness which led him to say silly things. He also made everything seem clear. But some things in history aren't really clear. He made them clear anyway.</p>",
  "<p>The Irish novelist Colm To\u00edb\u00edn, soon to embark on a year's fellowship at the New York Public Library's Centre for Scholars and Writers, is a very lucky guy. I should know. I am one of the inaugural Fellows who will shortly - and most reluctantly - be making way for To\u00edb\u00edn and his colleagues in the sleek new \u00a312 million facility overlooking Fifth Avenue, fast establishing itself as a brave new force in New York's intellectual life. </p> <p>For a writer like myself, unattached to any academic institution, the opportunity to research full-time in so fertile a vineyard, and be paid for the privilege, is such stuff as impossible dreams are made of. The NYPL's Centre is the kind of literary Xanadu that does not exist in Britain, whose Iron Chancellor has yet to wake up to the blessings of tax-deductible private philanthropy - described by the library's president, Paul LeClerc, as 'the perfect embodiment of the principles of the Enlightenment'. </p> <p>Will the day ever come when anyone can walk in off the street to consult a book in the British Library, built by the taxpayers' billions - as do more than two million people a year from all over the world at the New York Public Library? Like the inscription over the fireplace in the its Trustees Room - 'The City of New York has erected this building for the free use of all the people' - the Centre for Scholars and Writers is, in microcosm, what this great democracy is all about. Small wonder British visitors invariably ask for an application form before heading home. </p> <p>Which I, for one, won't be. When I arrived in New York 12 months ago, the proud if startled bearer of a scholar's visa, I thought I had come for a year researching my next biography. By the time I returned briefly to the UK in November, for publication of my life of Shakespeare, I knew that I was already sliding helplessly back into the love affair with America I began 20 years ago as The Observer 's Washington-based US editor. By the time I popped back to Britain in January, to judge the Whitbread awards (and inadvertently spark a national nervous breakdown over the relative literary merits of Seamus Heaney and Harry Potter), I was editing my life into a skip after selling the family home. </p> <p>That old, familiar feeling had returned with a vengeance: that I was far more comfortable in the UK as an occasional, affectionate visitor than an increasingly reluctant subject of the Crown. Every time I crossed the Atlantic, whether for book tours, poker tournaments in Las Vegas or summer vacations at Cape Cod, I felt so much more at home. Ten years ago I even married the US in the luminous shape of the novelist Cindy Blake, an adopted Londoner these 22 years yet still an all-American girl at heart. Together we always planned, once our five children were grown, to lead a transatlantic life, its centre of gravity gradually shifting west towards the country we both call home. </p> <p>It's not just that Britain, viewed from a real democracy, more than ever exudes its lethal combination of self-satisfaction and backward thinking: still dithering xenophobically about Europe (for me, its only hope of any future as even a wannabe world power); keeping 92 hereditary peers, for pity's sake, not to mention that pantomime horse of a monarchy; blowing a billion pounds' worth of schools and hospitals on that hollow, doomed, vainglorious Dome; grumbling nationalistically about immigrants when they are the pulsating lifeblood of my adopted homeland, its raison d' tre . No, for me, it's also that the intellectual, cultural and literary life of the Eastern seaboard is (like the language) more alive, more alert, much feistier than the primping and preening of London's cosy circle of back-patting glitterati. Viewed from here after a month back in Britain, the old country seems more than ever like some overgrown, nose-in-air, single-sex Pall Mall club, whose pettifogging rules it is so rejuvenating to escape. </p> <p>New York City thrives on change; it can't wait to pull down buildings, for instance, to erect even more thrilling ones. Hence - along with its throbbing masses of new arrivals, each community making contributions from the cultural to the culinary - the unique vitality of the place. There is no undue reverence for the past, or indeed the present, for its own sake. </p> <p>The very essence of Britain, by contrast, is and has always been a profound resistance to change, especially change for the inspiring sake of change. Yet fundamental change is, I believe, what Britain sorely needs. Tony Blair appears to grasp this, while mysteriously failing to do much about it. To spend July in London was to be reminded almost surreally that politicians in Britain have abandoned policy for packaging. Here is a Government elected with a huge majority that is far more concerned with being liked - and so re-elected - than putting its mandate into action. Politicians of true conviction go out there and implement their manifesto, braving the consequences. This lot - and I speak as one of who rejoiced in their election - have mired politics in the era of the permanent campaign. </p> <p>I hold these truths to be self-evident. As long as Britain retains a hereditary head of state, an oligarchic government formed in the name of that monarch rather than the electorate, an established but irrelevant Church, not to mention such class-drenched fripperies as an honours system adding antique handles to lists of autopilot names, it cannot truly call itself a popular democracy. As long as its people remain subjects rather than citizens, with no written rights and no Supreme Court to adjudicate them, it is not a country in which any self-respecting democrat can comfortably hang his or her hat. </p> <p>Like his Government, Blair is Her Majesty's Prime Minister, not ours; we are defended by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, not our own; it is illegal even to post a letter without a stamp bearing the monarch's head. 'You can tell a lot about a country,' as William Cobbett put it, 'which refers to the Royal Mint and the national debt.' Or, as John Updike more recently mused in the New Yorker : 'Without their crowns and coronets, how could the English be distinguished from the Icelanders?' </p> <p>As The Observer argued recently, the monarchy promotes 'privilege over people, chance over endeavour'. This culture of 'being something rather than doing something' filters right down to the cult of celebrity which sees Britain's irredeemably philistine middle class protesting about arts subsidies while worshipping what Bryan Appleyard has aptly called 'a succession of vacant bimbos and talentless hoodlums'. </p> <p>Even more distasteful, and far more retrograde, is the pervasive reluctance to acknowledge that Britannia no longer rules the waves - that insular, Last Night of the Proms mentality which clings to dreams of empire so long after its death. Having linked this to football hooligans abroad in a recent article here, I was gratified to see the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, take up the theme the next day. Hooliganism and racism, he said, were 'largely caused by English people with a distorted view of their own nationality', still carrying 'the baggage of empire' and thus 'distorting' what it means to be English. </p> <p>Right on. After the rank, enseamed sweat of English racism, how sweet it is to breathe the air of a nation based on the simple, pure intent of seeing if all the peoples of the world can live and work together, side by side, in mutually supportive harmony. It is surely the greatest experiment in the history of mankind; it has worked stunningly well for two increasingly prosperous centuries; and it is a privilege to tag along - to be so welcomed by Liberty's open arms, another refugee from bigotry and hypocrisy, humbug and cant, if not (like so many) dictatorship and repression. </p> <p>No, I am not blind to America's running sores: the aching gap between rich and poor; the failure to tackle gun control and political funding; the excesses of political correctness and religious fundamentalism; a taste for latter-day imperialism and sanctimonious witch-hunts, from the political to the sexual (the latter brilliantly savaged in Philip Roth's new novel, The Human Stain). But all, in their way, are by-products of the quest for individual freedom, and all are constantly under address. </p> <p>Equally unwelcome, for me, is the return of capital punishment on a truly reckless scale. But this, too, is a by-product of genuine, grassroots democracy. The same would be true in Britain if any government were rash enough to hold a referendum on the issue. The US, as Jonathan Freedland has so powerfully argued in his book Bring Home the Revolution, is a country run from the bottom up rather than the top down - a nation founded on expatriate English notions of civic rights and responsibilities, imported by Brits on the run from an unelected monarchy two centuries and more ago. </p> <p>To some extent, I confess, my departure amounts to a forlorn confession of failure. For more than 20 years, since I was first pilloried for challenging the monarchy before it became voguish, I have banged my head against the status quo's all too solid brick wall in a vain quest for constitutional reform - campaigning via lobby groups such as Charter 88, helping launch new ones like Common Sense . But even the simplest notions - that the head of state should take an oath of allegiance to the people, rather than the other way around - still elude Blighty's supposedly proud sense of fair play. </p> <p>So now, with Coriolanus, I am mustering the arrogance to banish you. I prefer to walk a city whose streets are numbered, rather than named, not just for practical reasons but to avoid any divisive hierarchy of personality. Streets which are now, moreover, safer than London's, thanks to the draconian (but undeniably effective) methods of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Manhattan is so compact I can walk everywhere, which is good for my waistline, and enjoy a feast of music and art (if not always theatre) as fine as even London has to offer. I can savour a restaurant boom which does not masquerade, as in Britain, as some sort of cultural revolution. And I can venture forth into a country the size of a continent, filled with fascinating mini-countries, each with its own distinctive character. </p> <p>Capping the joys of my vita nuova is its headquarters, a 48th-floor apartment I call A View with a Room. From my tiny balcony, on a clear day (most), I can see way beyond the Hudson to the Catskills and across the East River beyond JFK airport, from a central vantage point majestically framed by the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. Five hundred feet beneath me, day and night, throbs the most dynamic city on earth. </p> <p>So what will I miss, apart from some treasured friends (most of whom pass through New York regularly, anyway)? I already have three regular Manhattan poker schools to compensate for the loss of my 30-year-old seat in London's Tuesday Game (where I am still welcome, as I was last month, to make cameo appearances). And my beloved Arsenal are available here both on cable TV and at the Gooners' New York headquarters, McCormack's Bar on 3rd Ave - where, with my sports-mad wife and son, Joe, an editor on Tina Brown's Talk magazine, I suffered in May as they lost the Uefa Cup Final. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, concluding my last US column for The Observer before heading back to the Britain, I wrote: 'From a country alive to its future, back to one which seems able only to take a decaying satisfaction in its past.' </p> <p>Two decades on, for all Blair and his semi-works, I see little reason to change a word. As I said during the Potter furore, Britain is a nation which seems to derive a perverse pleasure from refusing to grow up and take itself seriously. The result, viewed from the not-so-new world, is a glorified theme park of a nation, Europe's constitutional Disneyland (where most of the rides, alas, do not work). </p> <p>You may well choose, after hearing me out, to bid this particular emigrant 'Good riddance'. But please don't sink to quoting at me, yet again, those hoary old words of Dr Johnson: 'A man who is tired of London is tired of life.'

  "<p>What should Martin Bell do next? This is the question underlying his new book, An Accidental MP , which recounts his brief Parliamentary career as the Independent MP for Tatton. Of course, he is still the Independent MP for Tatton but he promised when elected that he would only serve for one term, so he will be replaced at the next election.</p> <p>But his book reads very much like a job application - he is now addicted to being an MP and hopes some other constituency will select him. He says that he has already had a few approaches, and will decide at the end of the year. It slightly depends how fit he is.</p> <p>I must say I was shocked by how much he has aged since we used to see him reporting from the war zones on television. Even after his shooting in Sarajevo in l992, he could pass for fortysomething; now he looks his age - 62 - or more. His face is gaunt and hollow-eyed, he has an alarming tremor in his hands, and he is currently hobbling on two sticks having had a second hip replacement operation. The actual shooting, he says, had no lasting effects (though he still has a piece of shrapnel in his abdomen). But when the doctors X-rayed him they told him, 'By the way, you've got a degenerative disease of the hip,' and it started affecting him about four years ago. </p> <p>So Tatton was good timing for him - physically, he couldn't have carried on as a war reporter much longer, and mentally he was deeply at odds with John Birt's BBC. He believes that news and journalism died in the Nineties. 'Foreign news ceased to register as something there was an obligation to cover. Indeed, it risked your ratings! And if you're sitting in Bosnia, and there are important events going on and you can't get it on the air because Andrew and Fergie's divorce announcement wipes everything off - then, yes, I got out just in time. I'd been doing it for 33 years, so I'd had a long innings.' </p> <p>But the manner of his getting out was purest chance. He agreed to open a photography exhibition for his friend, Tom Stoddart, and afterwards went to dinner with Stoddart and his partner, Kate Hoey. They talked about Tatton and the idea of getting an 'anti-sleaze' candidate to stand against Neil Hamilton. Hoey asked if Bell would volunteer, and he said yes, but thought it was dinner-party chat. </p> <p>Next day, Alastair Campbell was on the phone asking about his politics. He said he didn't have any; he'd been a Young Liberal at Cambridge but had barely even voted since. Apparently this was the right answer, and a few days later he was in Tatton. It all happened so fast, he didn't even consult his then girlfriend, now wife, Fiona Goddard. Twenty four days after announcing his candidacy, he was an MP. </p> <p>He loves being an MP. 'It's very agreeable, working in this wonderful palace, with the illusion of being at the centre of things, and initials after your name. I never walk into the House of Commons without a sense of being privileged to be there - however dismayed I am by what I find once I've got there.' </p> <p>His book is by way of a protest at some of the things that dismay him. He thinks party funding is out of hand, and puts politicians in the pockets of rich donors. He believes the honours system is 'corrupt - look at Ashcroft'. He says the quality of debates is generally dire and: 'Prime Minister's Question Time is a disgrace to democracy. I get quite upset, I walk out of there quite regularly because it's so dreadful. Latterly, Tony Blair has just been acting as a chorus master, bringing in his backbenchers on cue. There has to be a better way of doing it. I don't accept the confrontational and gladiatorial nature of politics; I hate that.' </p> <p>Of course, most people standing as an anti-sleaze candidate would start by searching through their cupboards in search of potential skeletons. He claims he didn't even think of it. He had nothing to hide; he even offered to show journalists his bank statements. He said there was only one thing in his life he was ashamed of - that he had once doorstepped a relative of Princess Michael of Kent's to ask about her father's Nazi connections. I asked if that was seriously the worst thing he had ever done, and he said: 'Well, if we take out the way my first marriage ended... yes.' </p> <p>He left his first wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the mother of his two daughters, and still regrets it. But she remarried a French diplomat (she is French) and they are good friends now. He then married an American television journalist, Rebecca Sobel, but the marriage was 'a disaster', he says flatly, and only lasted four years. (A stepdaughter from that marriage bobbed up in the tabloids, saying she had been a drug addict and porn star. But it was hardly Bell's fault because she was already grown up when he married her mother.) Then he had a relationship with a German woman while he lived in Berlin, and now is married to Fiona Goddard, who at 34, is not much older than his elder daughter, Melissa, who campaigned for him in Tatton and married one of her fellow-campaigners. He also has a younger daughter, Catherine, another raving beauty who is at university in the States. </p> <p>They live in a very sweet but tiny cottage in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He says he could happily live out of two suitcases, except that he likes having his books around him - or rather his father's books. </p> <p>His father, Adrian Bell, was known as 'the sage of Suffolk' and wrote 20 books on country matters, including a minor classic called Corduroy (1930) which is still in print. He also invented the Times crossword, and compiled it all his life. However, it was his grand-father, who was news editor of the Observer under J.L Garvin, who inspired Martin Bell to become a journalist. </p> <p> He spent 30-odd years 'racketing round the war zones' with his fellow news nomads. I asked if he saw any similarities between them and MPs - alcohol and adultery are two that spring to mind. 'Yes, and insecurity,' he agrees, though actually the drunkenness in the House of Commons is less than he expected. 'Both careers attract a pretty rum bunch of people, and not altogether dissimilar people I would have to say. As a wandering reporter, the company you keep is part of the attraction - people you wouldn't normally give the time of day to become close friends. But politics also has these strange, driven characters, people who live on the edge.' He says that he knows of at least two MPs who are definitely 'in need of psychiatric care', but Matthew Parris puts the loony count much higher - seven on the Tory backbenches alone. </p> <p>So where does he fit in among all these strange, driven characters? He seems, on the face of it, a bit grey, a bit colourless. I wouldn't have thought he had any dark secrets to hide, except that he talked very oddly about how he 'survived the ordeal' of being interviewed by Anthony Clare and plotted his strategy beforehand. 'I did my homework on him - because he is a very clever chap and you have to study him as much as he studies you. But then I came charging out of my defences and attacked psychiatry in all its forms.' He added courteously that he hadn't felt the need to make any such preparation for me. </p> <p>Even his friends describe him as 'complex' and certainly there are some curious anomalies in his character. For instance, he describes himself as 'an Anglican with doubts', but used to go into the warzones cluttered with pagan fetishes - his white suit most obviously, but also Cornish piskies, silver dollars, four-leafed clovers. He talks like the quintessential pukka Englishman and quotes Chesterton and Kipling by the yard and yet he has chosen to live most of his adult life abroad. He wears his regimental tie and cufflinks and uses so many military expressions in conversation, you would think he had been a brigadier at least. But he was only a corporal in National Service; he was turned down for officer training. He says this was because he was a very shy young man, and failed his intelligence test the first time round, but then he got a first at Cambridge, which again seems odd. </p> <p>He is also very thin-skinned; he huffs like crazy at any hint of personal criticism. He particularly resents the label 'sanctimonious' which sticks to him as firmly as his white suit. I raised the question with unusual tact (I thought), asking if he had ever been accused of being sanctimonious BEFORE he became the anti-sleaze candidate? But he erupted just the same: 'Well, OK, I didn't still steal, rob, rape, so I was sanctimonious! You can't win this argument. Nor did I fiddle my expense account, which was unusual.' Would people have said he was rather priggish as a young man? 'No, they would have said I was serious. In my twenties I was very serious. For a long time I didn't have much of a life outside work. I probably worked harder at Cambridge than I should have done, but it was partly because my Dad bankrupted himself to send me to expensive schools and I really felt I had to succeed in order not to let him down. I felt I had a big debt to pay back, not only financially but morally. Now if that makes me sanctimonious, it makes me sanctimonious.' </p> <p>He is proud of what he has achieved as an MP, first and foremost 'restoring the good name of Tatton'. If he hadn't made his promise to stand down after one term, he'd be back like a shot. As it is, he hopes to find a new seat. </p> <p>'But I honestly haven't made up my mind. First of all I've got to make sure I'm fully recovered from this hip thing. I also want to see what the response is to this book, if it touches a chord. It's a question of what the public wants. I mean I get a huge mail - certainly a bigger mail than most other backbench MPs - and one of the things it's telling me is that people are tired of the name-calling of party politics. And if that were the case... I mean it's a bit inconsistent to write a book which says among other things that there should be more independents in politics, and then walk away.' </p> <p>But he knows that he will never be offered a seat as safe as Tatton, in fact he will have to do a 'reverse chicken run', moving from a safe seat to a marginal. Would he have the stomach to fight a marginal, given that it could get quite nasty? 'Well,' he agrees complacently, 'I've met some world-class intimidators in my time, it wouldn't bother me too much.' </p> <p>I'm not sure that's true; he seemed pretty intimidated by Christine Hamilton at their first encounter on Knutsford Heath. But anyway, I said, I didn't really mean that: I meant he would have to get nasty. 'No, no, that's not the way I do it. Never attack, never attack. I think that people are really tired of politicians bad-mouthing each other. You don't have to play that game. As soon as you play that game you've lost anyway - it's just part of the mud-wrestling.' </p> <p>\u0095 Martin Bell's An Accidental MP is published next month by Viking (\u00a316.99).</p>",
  "<p><strong> Wyndham Lewis: Painter and Writer</strong><br>Paul Edwards<br> Yale \u00a340, pp583<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502448041,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Who, today, reads Wyndham Lewis? Who derives enrichment or recognition from the paintings and drawings in half a dozen media? Arguably, the last Wyndham Lewis hour was that of his retrospective at the Tate in the summer of 1956, the year before the artist and writer's death. What successor has he had, with the single exception of that other splendidly gifted outsider, Michael Ayrton?</p> <p>It is this condition of eclipse which, manifestly, incenses Paul Edwards. He bears witness to a sense of scandalous injustice. Wyndham Lewis the artist, novelist, social critic, pamphleteer, must be restored to his high place in the pantheon of English arts and letters. </p> <p>This quest (the quixotic is generously in order) has engendered an awesome monograph. It is awesome in its dimensions, in the floodtide of scholarly detail, in its tone of relentless advocacy.</p> <p>Yale University Press has produced a resplendent tome. Though the type is very small, the layout is inspired and the 332 illustrations are of extraordinary quality. They leap off the page as Lewis purposed. The 'select bibliography' is appropriately monumental. The sheer weight of the work makes for awkward handling, but this again is apposite to its subject and polemic voice. A coffee-table volume would be wholly inappropriate; something stronger, more bitter is called for.</p> <p>Edwards analyses, minutely, the aesthetic and intellectual background. What he justly identifies as a most unusual fusion of philosophy and satire, of aesthetic ideology and journalistic mockery, had tangled roots. These comprised cubism and futurism, the vitalist psychology of Bergson and the tactical 'primitivism' of Picasso, but also a lineage of anger in British letters which includes medieval 'flyting', as well as the ironies of Swift and of Hazlitt.</p> <p>From the outset, moreover, Wyndham Lewis strove to break through both as painter and novelist, as literary adviser and graphic virtuoso. It was not till the summer of 1914, with the publication of Blast, that the concept of vorticism, in which Ezra Pound's role was seminal, achieved definition. </p> <p>It may be, even beyond Edwards's inferences, that the founding text was Shakespeare's Timon of Athens. Like Marx and Karl Kraus, fellow adepts at anger and haters of the bourgeoisie, Lewis prized this erratic block in the canon. He felt kinship with Timon's assault on human greed and hypocrisy, with the inspired loathing of Timon's solitude. The portfolio of abstract evocations of the play (1912-1913) is among Lewis's finest works. The fury is made colder by the unyielding stricture of the lines. </p> <p>Having experienced fitful but exposed action in the First World War, Lewis returned to the shredded bohemia of London. He was now convinced that European civilisation was, as Pound put it, 'a bitch gone rotten in the teeth'. Almost single-handed, Lewis set out to expound a blueprint for renascence. Steiner and Nietzsche, the purities of egotism and the dream of a new man inspired his raging critique and proposals. From The Apes of God to Self-Condemned 30 years later, there followed an outpouring of programmatic fictions, satires, political-cultural tracts and pamphlets.</p> <p>Edwards examines these with often ecstatic care. Thus Enemy of the Stars 'was probably the most comprehensively self-reflexive text produced in English since Tristram Shandy... it is impressively successful'. Time and Western Man, which is commented upon as if it were Aquinas or Hume, turns out to be 'one of the great books of the twentieth century'. The Childermass, with its allegory of true modernism, was left incomplete - 'an appropriately Michelangelesque note on which to conclude this analysis'.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, most of this material borders on the illegible. There are sparkling passages, mordant sarcasms. Often, Wyndham Lewis achieves a distinct level of hectoring energy. Overall, however, the books and tracts are moribund. Edwards's hype makes this more evident.</p> <p>Even his cult of Wyndham Lewis is severely tested by certain publications during the Thirties. Hitler appeared in 1931; The Jews: Are they Human? in 1939. Edwards's embarrassed apologies are no doubt valid in so far as Lewis's brand of 'proto-Nazism' was idiosyncratic and utopian.</p> <p>Much in these and other pronouncements is muddled crankiness. 'The Hitlerist dream is full of an imminent classical serenity - leisure and abundance.' An Arcadia marred, hitherto by the wretched Jews. Behind 'this ill-judged populist rhetoric', pleads Edwards, lies a 'desperate sincerity'. No doubt. But, to echo Ren\u00e9 Char's great maxim: 'It is not given to everyone to be midnight.' In C\u00e9line's loathsome views, in Pound's, the context of formal genius is undeniable. Not in Wyndham Lewis.</p> <p>Lewis the painter and draughtsman is another matter. A number of his portraits are classics of incisiveness. His hieratic portrayal of Edith Sitwell remains definitive; there is a wonderful, gently ironic perception in the representations of T.S. Eliot; the drawings and canvases which have Ezra Pound for their subject are generous in their penetration.</p> <p>Lewis's drawing of Rebecca West, the Portrait of the Artist's Wife (now at Kelvingrove), the relatively early seated figure of Edwin Eaves or the Smiling Gentleman of 1939 will, surely endure. As may some of the depictions, at once apocalyptic and down-to-earth, of Canadian gun-pits and batteries first drawn in July-August 1917. And there is a magic of bucolic forgiveness in the pen and ink sketches and water-colours of bathing women which Lewis produced during his long absence from England in the Forties. </p> <p>In the art also, however, there are problems. Nothing or almost nothing seems to have evolved. The harsh linearity, the tricks of semi-abstraction in faces and figures, the cubist angles are constant from the start. What ripens? Edwards's phrase, a 'cryptic immaturity' applies to far more than Lewis's early literary products. It is in play throughout. Are we dealing, as Edwards claims, with a willed concentration on the 'imperfections of life' and the saturation of modern existence by the mechanical? Or, rather with a clenched lack of humanity as insidious in the art as it is in the writings? There is a betraying myopia in Lewis's condescensions towards the thronging humanity of Joyce's Ulysses.</p> <p>A shorter, critically balanced study would have done more to advance this controversial cause. None the less, Edwards's impassioned industry and the splendour of the illustrations command respect.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The PowerBook</strong><br>Jeanette Winterson<br>Jonathan Cape \u00a314.99, pp243<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450139,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Jeanette Winterson has changed her name. She is Jeanette.Winterson and her new novel is The PowerBook. It looks like an Apple Mac manual. The first impression is of confident, wacky gimmickry. The chapters have headings such as: 'Open Hard Drive', 'New Document', 'Search', 'Show Balloons', 'Chooser' and 'Really Quit?'. There is even one called 'Empty Trash'.</p> <p>The narrator offers, by e-mail, 'Freedom just for one night', to become someone else through fiction. Winterson is about to prance into virtual reality, fearing nothing. She is going on-line (not for real, Cape remain her publishers). But she is about to put herself on the line - more than ever before. There seems every reason to sign on cautiously. </p> <p>It takes no more than a page or two before it becomes marvellously clear that Winterson has no future as a boffin. The computer is, for her, a conceit, an invitation to explore, a way of making narratives come and go faster than the speed of light. It never holds her up or back. Her writing is graceful, jargon-free, light as thistledown.</p> <p>Computers are fickle and provisional: suited, perhaps, to the telling of love stories. And yet this novel is in no way 'state of the art'; its heels are in the past, its heart outside time. It is more like a book of spells than a computer manual, written by someone determined to be a witch through words, convinced that lives are transmutable, open to the power of wishes. She believes that we can be authors of our own lives. </p> <p>Love is Jeanette Winterson's subject - or the only one to which she has been faithful. Sometimes her writing about love has been fey and pretentious (I could not get on with The Passion and its cute Napoleonic posturing), sometimes brave and true (Written on the Body was an extraordinary, extended love letter).</p> <p>There is something gallant about Winterson's persistence - she has never been a faint-hearted romantic. She has never stopped trying to unriddle love: The Passion, Sexing the Cherry, Written on the Body are all romantic crusades. And Winterson's lesbian identity is essential to this: she writes with the zeal of a St George liberating a princess from the dragon's mouth.</p> <p>Indeed The PowerBook reads, more than anything, like a rescue operation. She is resolved to salvage love from everything that endangers it. But she knows - it is a refrain: 'There is no love that does not pierce the hands and feet.' The Christian overtone recalls Oscar Wilde's The Selfish Giant and although her wit is not Wildean (it is all her own), she does share his romantic, quasi-religious morbidity. She knows what lovers are up against. </p> <p>In The PowerBook, the narrator and her punter fall in love in a range of imaginary incarnations, in several different countries and periods of history. There is only one aspect to this that is irritatingly tricksy: the sustained pretence that the novel is 'interactive', that it has two authors or more. Winterson tries for audience participation, collars us directly. But her 'you and me' has an uneasy facility. This is because there can be no doubt about who is in charge. Winterson writes with evangelical assurance, vaulting ambition, total control. Sometimes the book reads like a DIY bible. She is the only one with her hands on the keyboard. </p> <p>The story starts in 1591. A young woman is about to import tulips from Turkey to Holland. She disguises herself as a boy, the tulip bulbs are convincingly stitched into her trousers. It is a lightly fanciful idea - in the virtual world, anything goes. A woman can become a man, as Winterson puts it, 'by a little horticultural grafting'.</p> <p>Then follows a wonderful scene aboard a ship on which the tulip-boy is travelling. The Islamic captain advises (while eating chicken) on the unreality of the material world and as he does so - to perfect his point - lightly tosses the chicken carcass into the waves. He says: 'You will live in this world as though it is real, until it is no longer real, and then you will know, as I do, that all your adventures and all your possessions, and all your losses, and what you have loved - this gold, this bread, the green glass sea - were things you dreamed as surely as you dreamed of buffalo and watercress.' </p> <p>The captain is a master of virtual reality before its time and there is something uplifting and moving about the lightness of his speech. At its best, the writing takes your breath away: the coquettish philosophising, the elegance and caprice, the ability to move easily between the metaphysical and the visible world - and even to crack good jokes without doing any structural damage to the story. And when the tulip boy has to instruct a princess in the erotic arts, the tulip proves surprisingly potent. Winterson gets away with murder - or should that be love? </p> <p>She writes: 'The partition between real and invented is as thin as a wall in a cheap hotel room.' And the idea that all circumstantial detail is a mirage is part of the pleasure of the book. Life in Paris is full of details that seem too vividly incidental to have been invented: the pair of Dalmatians, the buskers playing Vivaldi on the metro blocking the exits and entrances, the French waiter who flares his nostrils with 'that hotel trade mixture of servility and disgust'.</p> <p>In Capri, Winterson tells the marvellous story of a frisbee that lands on a statue of the Madonna, giving her a halo she was not bargaining for. At times, reading the novel is like being on a strange package holiday with a wonderfully unreliable guide. It comes as no surprise when, in the tradition of Thomas Hardy and John Fowles, Winterson offers alternative endings to her chimerical story. </p> <p>Jeanette Winterson is like the ancient (or not-so-ancient) mariner: she holds us with her glittering eye and, even when we doubt her, we must hear her out. But unlike the ancient mariner, she is too witty, original, and good at what she does to spoil any wedding party.</p>",
  "The four members of a Channel 4 television crew imprisoned in Liberia on espionage charges arrived back safely at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning after a week of threats, interrogation and learning last Wednesday that they faced trial on charges punishable by the death penalty. <p>Speaking for the first time of their ordeal, the four men described conditions in the police holding cells of President Charles Taylor's Liberia, where they witnessed the torture of a youth, a near-rape and the misery of the long-term inmates. </p> <p>'The violence was extraordinary,' said cameraman Tim Lambon yesterday. </p> <p>The four journalists - Zimbabwe-born Lambon, presenter Sorious Samoura from Sierra Leone, British director David Barrie and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were granted official permission to make a documentary in Liberia, which is fast approaching the status of an international pariah because of its trade in 'blood diamonds' and its support for the rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone who routinely chop the hands off children. </p> <p>But prior approval meant nothing when the four were bundled into lorries by 20 police brandishing rifles. Samoura, who is a household name throughout West Africa and celebrated for his documentary Cry Freetown, about Sierra Leone's brutal civil war, told a Heathrow press conference: 'These men in black started beating us and pushing us out into the street in the dark. We thought that was it.' </p> <p>Barrie said it had been a moment of 'total terror, considering the number of officers there, the number of rifles there and the extent to which these guys had absolutely been hyped up'. </p> <p>Lambon added: 'There might not have been all the serious physical abuse, such as rifle butts in the back of the head, although there was some of that, it was a situation of mental terror.' </p> <p>They were taken to police holding cells. Conditions were dire: the one toilet stank, the heat was unremitting, other prisoners had to pay bribes to go to the toilet and there were constant fights. Lambon and the others were searched in an aggressive and intimidating way, and had no choice but to witness the routine barbarities of Liberia's strange version of law and order. </p> <p>'They slapped one boy, he must have been 17, against the wall so hard he must have fractured his wrist. I will never forget the sound of him howling with pain. They almost gang-raped two women, but they were saved at the last moment. And there were constant fights,' Lambon told The Observer . </p> <p>'I told the others how not to display edges, to look down, to droop your shoulders, keep out of the way, but not out of sight, to hold your elbows in, so that you have a profile that is lower than shark-shit,' he said. </p> <p>'Conditions for the other prisoners were far worse. They had to pay bribes of five Liberian dollars to go to the toilet, 20 dollars to get out of the cell. </p> <p>'Let me tell you, we met hundreds of people who today are still in those jails, whose families don't even know they are there. And they don't have a hope. If you don't have money, you don't get water and you don't get food.' </p> <p>On Tuesday night, as international pressure for their release grew, they were taken from the police cells to the feared headquarters of the National Security Agency. Here Samoura was separated from the rest of the team. He was taken into a pitch-dark solitary cell the size of a 'broom cupboard' and threatened with a knife. 'The knifeman said: \"We're going to cut out your heart and use your blood to write Cry Liberia.\" Every time anyone touched my door I thought that was the end.' </p> <p>The President had been angered by the discovery of a bidding document by the team to CNN, setting out in lurid detail the dark side of the Liberian regime. The document had been brought into Liberia by mistake, Samoura admitted. </p> <p>In London, Insight News, the production company behind the documentary, and Channel 4 journalists worked around the clock to bring pressure to bear. Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, former South African President Nelson Mandela, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Bill Clinton's envoy to Africa, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, all pitched in. Obasanjo called up Taylor several times, pointing out the difference between espionage and normal journalistic practice. </p> <p>Their court appearance was a low point. The Liberian judge refused bail, and the crew had little idea of how much pressure was being generated on their behalf. </p> <p>Then things slowly started to go their way. On Thursday it was announced that former world footballer of the year George Weah - who plays for Liberia - was to intercede on behalf of the four journalists. Weah has film-star status in his homeland, and the ear of his President. Meanwhile, Channel 4's lawyers came up with an apology for the bidding document with which the regime could save face. </p> <p>The statement issued under the journalists' names read: 'We, the four journalists currently held in Monrovia Central Prison, wish to express our unreserved apology to both His Excellency the President of Liberia and the people of Liberia for any offence which our actions or statements have caused.' </p> <p>Channel 4's chairman, Vanni Treves, also sent a letter of apology to Taylor, the contents of which have not been released. Looking pale and exhausted, Barrie said: 'We went there to do a job, we meant no offence. We went in there to try and understand the country.' </p> <p>Taylor claimed the documentary would have fuelled an 'international conspiracy' to destroy Liberia by implicating it in gun-running and diamond-smuggling. </p> <p>If broadcast, the allegations would have been sufficient to trigger international sanctions or military action by the US and UK against Liberia, he said.</p>",
  "The Government was last night accused of a cover-up over the safety of its mass meningitis immunisation programme after The Observer obtained confidential documents that show at least 11 people have died after injections to prevent the disease. <p>Although doctors have reported the deaths as part of routine monitoring of effects of the vaccine to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the Government has not published the figures and last night insisted the programme was safe. </p> <p>Documents from the MCA obtained by The Observer show that since the immunisation programme began last year there have been more than 16,000 adverse reactions reported by GPs under the so-called Yellow Card system. The Department of Health estimates only 10-15 per cent of reactions are reported under the scheme so the real figure is likely to be far higher. </p> <p>Britain is the first European country to introduce the vaccine. Although GPs have been told it cannot induce symptoms of meningitis, two of the deaths after vaccination have been attributed to 'septicaemia meningicoccal', the infection of the blood that results from the disease. </p> <p>Each year around 1,500 people contract meningitis C, with about 150 fatalities. The Government has said the programme had reduced cases by 70 per cent since it was introduced last year. So far 13 million babies, children and adults have been immunised. </p> <p>Shadow Health Secretary Liam Fox last night called on the Government to launch an inquiry into meningitis C immunisation, which was rushed in because of an expected rise in cases over the winter. 'If information has been withheld, it will lead to suspicions that officials have not been entirely frank. If 11 deaths have not been made public, the Government risks the public losing faith in the system. This is woefully incompetent.' </p> <p>Fox, a GP himself, added: 'Immunisation is about a balance of risks. Although the balance is almost always in favour of immunisation, without information parents cannot be expected to make an informed decision.' </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said it chose not to make the deaths public for fear of panicking parents into withdrawing their children from inoculation. The Medicines Control Agency had investigated all the deaths and decided there was no evidence of a link to the vaccines. 'We maintain the vaccine is safe,' she said last night. </p> <p>A report from the Government's Committee on the Safety of Medicines last Thursday gave the vaccine the all-clear after extensive inquiries into the level of reactions. The main supplier of the drug, US company Wyeth, said it had not been informed of any fatalities by the Department of Health. Spokesman Don Barrett said: 'We are always in contact with the Department and the rate of reactions is considered to be at a very low level for the number vaccinated.' </p> <p>Isabella Thomas, of vaccination support group Jabs (Justice Awareness Basic Support), said she had had reports of children having fits after being given the vaccine: 'I am not convinced by government reassurances. We are receiving daily calls from parents whose children have had serious reactions. We believe the Government introduced it far too quickly.' </p> <p>Dr Jayne Donegan, a London GP who has seen an increase in reactions among children at her surgery, spoke of a campaign, encouraged by the Government, to brand people who do not have their children vaccinated as irre sponsible. 'This is not necessarily true, especially with something as untried as the meningitis C vaccine.' </p> <p>Adam Finn, a paediatric expert at Sheffield Children's Hospital who is carrying out trials of the vaccine, said he believed the drug was safe, although it had induced extreme reactions in some children. 'We don't want children having fits as a result of a drug that hasn't been properly tested, but equally we wouldn't want a perfectly good drug maligned on the basis of hearsay.' </p> <p>He said the normal trials on a new vaccine were not possible in Britain because of the relatively small numbers of people who contracted the disease. Instead scientists had tested whether the vaccine produced sufficient antibodies. </p> <p>He said the Government had a duty to give the public all relevant information about the drug: 'The public has sufficient intelligence to make the decision for themselves. The way to get them to accept it is to tell the whole story.' </p> <p>Liberal Democrat health spokesman Euan Harris said he had already raised questions in Parliament about the vaccine. 'I am very pro-vaccinations,' he said, 'but I have been concerned about this.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:martin.bright@observer.co.uk\"> martin.bright@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Reggie Kray, the last surviving member of Britain's most infamous gangland family, is finally to leave prison this week after Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled yesterday that he should be allowed home to die. <p>Kray, 66, is terminally ill with cancer of the bladder and has a life expectancy of only a few weeks. Having spent 32 years behind bars, he faces a world changed beyond all recognition from the one he left behind, but friends and family say knowing that he will not die in prison will be a great comfort to him. </p> <p>He was said to have been overcome with emotion after being given the news by his prison governor. Although Kray is currently too ill to be moved, his solicitor, Trevor Linn, said yesterday he hoped to be at home with his wife, Roberta, by the end of the week. </p> <p>Rather than returning to London's East End, Reggie is likely to live out his last days at his wife's home a few miles from his Norfolk prison, where she moved two years ago to be closer to him. Insiders at the hospital say Kray is unlikely to leave his bed, let alone take part in any welcome home parties. </p> <p>Anne Osborn, acting chief executive at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital said: 'Mr Kray will not be leaving in the foreseeable future. 'He hasn't recovered sufficiently to be fit to go.' </p> <p>Reggie and his twin, Ronnie, led Britain's most notorious criminal clan. Their gang, The Firm, established a Mafia-style grip on London's criminal underworld in the Sixties, specialising in protection and extortion rackets. The Twins, as Ronnie and Reggie were universally known, were born in Bethnal Green, east London, in 1933, with Reggie the younger by 45 minutes. The family was part Irish, Jewish, Gypsy and Austrian. Their father was a second-hand clothes dealer. Their mother, Violet, made them the centre of her world and they worshipped her. </p> <p>By the time they were 17, both were accomplished amateur boxers but decided against turning professional for fear of losing their looks. </p> <p>Both were dishonourably discharged from National Service in 1954 after spending much of their time in military prisons, and within two years they established the biggest criminal racket in London's East End. The turning point for them came when they bought a seedy snooker club in Bethnal Green which was the scene of almost constant fights. They renamed it the Regal and within weeks had turned the club around, making it a popular celebrity haunt. It was while running the club that their reputation for violence became established. </p> <p>When a team of Maltese gangsters came to the Regal trying to collect protection money, one had a bayonet thrust through his hand and the others were beaten unconscious. </p> <p>Despite their violent associations, the twins brushed shoulders with the famous and appeared in public with the likes of Judy Garland, Diana Dors, George Raft and Lord Boothby. </p> <p>A feud with a rival gang led to their downfall. Ronnie shot George Cornell dead in the bar of the Blind Beggar pub in the Mile End Road, east London. A few months later, Reggie lured Jack 'The Hat' McVitie, with whom he had fallen out, to a flat in the East End on the pretext of attending a wild party, and stabbed him to death. </p> <p>Believing they were above the law, the Krays relied on the fact that no one would testify against them. But they were sunk when one of their gang members decided to turn supergrass. They were convicted of the respective murders at the Old Bailey in 1969 and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum 30 years. </p> <p>The twins have been a source of huge fascination, spawning books and in 1990 a film, The Krays. Among the celebrities who have supported calls for Reggie's release were Patsy Kensit, Roger Daltrey and Barbara Windsor. </p> <p>In March 1995 Ronnie died of a heart attack at the age of 61 at Broadmoor. In April this year elder brother Charlie died at the age of 73 while serving time in Parkhurst prison for drugs offences. Reggie swore then that he would not die in prison and began campaigning harder than ever for his release. </p> <p>'Although this is what we have been fighting for,' said Roberta Kray, 'the circumstances under which it has been given mean it is tinged with sadness.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\"> tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a> </p> <p> <b>Britain then and now</b><br></p> <p> <b> 1969 - the year the Kray twins were jailed</b> </p> <p>Pint of beer in London: 2s 0d (10p) </p> <p>Bottle (26 fl oz) of whisky: \u00a32 10s 0d (\u00a32.50) </p> <p>Tin of beans: 1s 2d (6p) </p> <p>First class stamp: 5d (2p) </p> <p>Colour TV licence: \u00a311 - black and white \u00a36 </p> <p>Fashion: long boots, maxi skirts and mini skirts </p> <p>Number one hit in the week the gangsters were imprisoned: 'Where Do You Go To (My Lovely?)', Peter Sarstedt </p> <p>Chart music: Beatles, Marvyn Gaye, Neil Sedaka, Amen Corner </p> <p>Pop culture: flower power and the Woodstock festival </p> <p>Car: Ford Escort 1300: \u00a3838 3s 5d (\u00a3838.17) </p> <p>TV favourites: Dr Who, Dixon of Dock Green, Coronation Street, The Woodentops </p> <p>Radio: The Archers </p> <p>Popular films: True Grit, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie </p> <p>Kray birthplace, Hoxton: poor housing </p> <p>Events: Concorde maiden flight on 2 March in France; Victoria tube line opens </p> <p> <b> 2000 - year of Reggie's release</b> </p> <p>Pint of beer in London: \u00a32.40 </p> <p>Bottle (1litre) of whisky: \u00a316.45 </p> <p>Baked beans: 31p </p> <p>First class stamp: 27p </p> <p>Colour TV licence: \u00a3104 - b/w \u00a334.50 </p> <p>Fashion: pencil skirts, cashmere and tweed </p> <p>Number one: 'Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)', Spiller </p> <p>Chart music: Eminem, Moby, Posh Spice </p> <p>Pop culture: Glastonbury and Reading festivals </p> <p>Car: Ford Focus Zetec 1.6litre: \u00a313,000 </p> <p>TV favourites: Big Brother, Coronation Street, The Tweenies </p> <p>Radio: The Archers </p> <p>Films: Perfect Storm, High Fidelity, X-Men </p> <p>Kray birthplace, Hoxton: trendy bars, expensive lofts </p> <p>Events: Concorde grounded; Victoria line closed south of Victoria </p> <p> Dorota Nosowicz</p>",
  "Ally McBeal may complain that all the best men are married, but a new breed of self-confessed serial mistresses say women in the know would not want it any other way. <p>Today's mistresses are a different species from the old-school Other Woman, whose lonely days revolved around the phone call that never came. The modern mistress is in control and in demand. Her position empowers her and, best of all, she never has to watch football in bed. </p> <p>Victoria Griffin - author of a new book, The Mistress: Histories, Myths and Interpretations of the 'Other Woman', and a mistress herself - believes the modern mistress has discovered what men have long known: sex without commitment is fun and empowering. </p> <p>Griffin believes that, while marriage forces women to cede control over their lives, illicit love affairs allow them to protect their autonomy while enjoying loving relationships. </p> <p>'I value my independence and have a horror of domesticity and family life,' said Griffin, a serial mistress for 15 years and in her current illicit relationship for three years. 'At the same time, I thrive on having an intimate relationship in the background - stable, but not obvious. Thus, someone who is unable to be with me all the time but who, when he is with me, is fully with me, is ideal.' </p> <p>Griffin believes that, although society likes to pretend women are free to co-exist in equal relationships with men, the reality is different. 'It's getting more difficult to admit to being a serial mistress because marriage isn't the oppressive and coercive institution it once was,' she said. 'People don't have to get married so they're expected to remain faithful when they finally do. </p> <p>'But we're deluding ourselves. Society still conditions women into taking a second seat in relationships and teaches them to compromise their lives for the benefit of their male partner,' she added. </p> <p>'I know myself well enough to know I simply don't have the internal boundaries to resist putting myself in second place in a relationship. I know the sort of life I want to lead and I know the characteristics in me that could endanger it. I've chosen my life carefully to get what I want: the best of both worlds.' </p> <p>Griffin believes the empowered mistress relishes her anarchic, secret life and thrives on the excitement of falling in love and living for the moment. 'You can end up with no power at all as a mistress or you can end up holding the full deck of cards. It's completely up to you,' she said. </p> <p>Phyllis Rose, author of a book on Victorian marriages, Parallel Lives, maintains that modern mistresses get their power from questioning society's definition of a successful relationship. 'The plots we choose to impose on our own lives are limited and limiting,' she said. 'And in no area are they so banal and sterile as in love and marriage, where we filter out experience through the romantic clich\u00e9s of popular culture.' </p> <p>Margaret Emsley, a 45-year-old antiques dealer from Eastbourne, East Sussex, has been a mistress to three men for the past nine years and says she's never been happier or more in control of her own life. </p> <p>'I have a thriving business, my own house and a comfortable lifestyle. But as a mistress, I get the best of a man while being able to ignore the worst,' she said. 'After three failed marriages, I've found my recipe for happiness.' </p> <p>'I don't have to wash his socks, clean his kitchen floor or do the countless chores a wife has to, and instead I get taken to the best restaurants, given expensive presents and get treated like a queen. </p> <p>'I wouldn't marry any of my lovers for the world. I'm never going to give any man the power to have a say in how I live my life or be unfaithful to me. I'm holding the pack and I'm not giving away a single card.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\"> amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "When Christopher Robb collapsed on the stairs of Dunfermline High School at 1.30pm on 17 December 1999, his world collapsed with him. He had been feeling strange for two hours since being given the vaccine for the meningitis C virus. <p>'The next thing I remember was waking up in hospital later that afternoon with needles and equipment sticking out of me,' says Robb, now 17. </p> <p>Staff at Queen Margaret Hospital in the Fife town, suspecting meningitis itself, gave Robb a brain scan and attempted a lumbar puncture for diagnostic purposes. He was discharged the next day, but collapsed again and was readmitted to be kept under observation for three days. His life has not been the same since. He made a slow recovery and his schoolwork suffered as a result. After Christmas he fell into a suicidal depression that his family is convinced was caused by the trauma of the reaction to the vaccine. </p> <p>Robb has just heard that he did not get the exam grades he needed to get to the university of his choice. </p> <p>His mother Una said: 'We have no idea what went on in his brain that day. We just feel there must be a connection to the jab. He was a young man with everything to look forward to. This has affected his whole life.' </p> <p>Robb has now recovered from the effects of the vaccine and will soon come off medication he has been taking for depression. He hopes to retake his Scottish Higher exams next year and study sports science at Edinburgh or Stirling universities. But it remains mystifying that a fit young man with no history of fits or fainting, who played rugby and football for his school, should have been affected in such a devastating way by a simple vaccine. </p> <p>Robb's is one of 11,000 cases reported by GPs across the country in which the new meningitis vaccine has caused adverse reactions. The vast majority are relatively minor, involving the usual headaches, rashes and dizziness associated with vaccination jabs. But some are far more serious, and have resulted in hospital treatment and even death, say doctors. </p> <p>Una Robb was told that there were no other cases similar to Christopher's. She was instructed not to talk to the media when she rang the Meningitis Trust's helpline for advice. 'It has never been disputed that this was a reaction to the vaccine, but the school doctor insisted it was an isolated case,' she told The Observer. </p> <p>The family kept quiet until they heard about the case of another Scottish boy, 14-year-old Keith MacGregor, who died last March five days after a menigitis C jab at Inverurie Academy in Aberdeenshire. MacGregor was taken ill while playing a Saturday football match. He died the following morning. </p> <p>'The whole thing has been covered up,' says Mrs Robb. 'That's what really annoys me. I read about the boy from Inverurie and thought \"that could have been me\".' </p> <p>She is now furious that she was told to keep quiet about his case: 'We kept asking them to make it public, to make sure people were careful. But they kept telling us not to talk to the media.' </p> <p>The small northern Scottish town of Inverurie has been devastated by Keith MacGregor's death, although health officials immediately reassured the family that the death was not connected to the inoculation. A letter sent by Dr Jon Cresswell, consultant in public health medicine at Grampian Health Board, to all parents at the time said: 'Although your child may have had menC vaccine recently, I want to reassure you that [Keith MacGregor's death] is not related to the vaccine, which is very effective in preventing meningitis C.' </p> <p>MacGregor's father was told his son's life might have been saved if he had had the injection earlier. </p> <p>Graham Richie, acting head of the academy at the time the boy died, said the letter had reassured parents and teachers, who had felt responsible. The school will make a statement about the possible link to the vaccine this week, after talks with the MacGregor family. </p> <p>There are also serious concerns for young babies who are now vaccinated against meningitis C, when they receive their other jabs at the ages of two, three and four months. Of the 11 deaths reported to the Medicines Control Agency, six involved sudden infant death syndrome, and GPs are reporting thousands of cases of reactions among babies. </p> <p>One north London couple said they wanted The Observer to tell the story of their son, who nearly died after a meningitis jab earlier this month. They have chosen to remain anonymous because of their need to maintain good relations with their hospital and GP. </p> <p>The baby, 'Ralph', developed a high temperature and started vomiting after his third meningitis jab. He was taken to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. As happened in the case of Christopher Robb, staff immediately treated it as a case of meningitis, although they said 'Ralph' couldn't have developed this from the drug. His parents were told he could die if doctors couldn't get his temperature down. </p> <p>Eventually, after administering heavy doses of antibiotics overnight, his temperature returned to normal. Again the family were told this was an isolated case. Their GP told them Ralph had 'a slight reaction'. </p> <p>'We kept asking for information,' the mother said last night. 'But they wouldn't tell us what was happening. We were told the vaccine was safe, but I couldn't believe the seriousness of it.' </p> <p>Her husband is now convinced babies are given too many vaccinations at the same time. 'It would be extremely unlikely that our son developed meningitis on exactly the same day as the injection,' he said. 'I am a great believer in vaccination programmes, but there must be better ways of doing it. It is devastating to watch your child dying.'</p>",
  "It would be hard in the modern age for a 12,000-tonne cargo ship, loaded to the gunnels with furnace slag, to disappear from the face of the earth. But that is exactly what happened to the MV Cheung Son, a Panama-flagged bulk carrier, as it ploughed through a slow swell in the South China Sea about 200 miles east of Hong Kong in November 1998. <p>It didn't vanish, of course. It was 'shipjacked' by pirates. The modern-day Long John Silvers gathered the crew of 23 together on the deck and shot them. Their bodies were weighted, bound and gagged, and dumped overboard. Later, six bodies were recovered in fishing nets off the southern Chinese port of Shantou. Of the ship and its cargo, there is no trace. The suspicion is that it has been given a new identity, with the collusion of corrupt officials. </p> <p>The shipjacking of the Cheung Son was one of nine in the past two years. The rising problem of piracy on the high seas has led Foreign Officer Minister Peter Hain to call for global action. 'Piracy is deadly,' Hain told The Observer. 'Attacks on sailors, ships and their cargoes are increasing, by both opportunists and organised crime groups. They also steal huge vessels such as oil tankers, worth millions of pounds, and whose cargo if not protected poses a dreadful threat to the environment.' </p> <p>Pirates work mainly from wretched places of the earth - Somalia in the Horn of Africa, west Africa, Bangladesh, and Indonesia - using speed boats capable of 30 knots to overtake ships going half as fast. The choke-zones of the high seas are favoured places to strike: the Malacca Straits between Malaysia and Indonesia and the lawless waters where the Red Sea enters the Gulf of Aden, a short boat ride from Somalia. </p> <p>The Piracy Reporting Centre of the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) has a standard instruction that the coast off Somalia is a no-go area. The advice is to sail 50 or 100 miles off shore and keep radio use to a minimum. </p> <p>Recently, pirates in small fast boats have tried to board ships off Bab el Mandeb in the Red Sea's southern tip. Masters report that small boats wait at the northern end of the traffic lane where ships slow down to turn towards the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>The Indonesian archipelago and the Straits of Malacca - the world's busiest sea lane after the English Channel - have seen increased attacks. 'Piracy is increasingly concentrated in South-east Asia and the Indian Ocean,' said Hain. 'The number of pirate attacks worldwide in the first six months of this year was 161, an increase (of 56) on the same period last year.' </p> <p>Captain Jayant Abhyankar of the IMB said: 'Most ships that are targeted are going eastbound through the Straits of Malacca, loaded, fairly low in the water and because the way the traffic system works, close to the Indonesian shore.' </p> <p>Incidents logged in the past week by the IMB give a picture of modern piracy. </p> <p>\u0095 In the Malacca Straits two speedboats showing no lights approached a bulk carrier from the stern at night. The ship directed an Aldis lamp at the boats, which sped off. </p> <p>\u0095 Off Chittagong in Bangladesh, four pirates in a small wooden boat tried to steal zinc anodes - worth around $200 each - from the rudderpost of an anchored chemical tanker. Crew spotted the sea-thieves, who fled. </p> <p>\u0095 A would-be pirate was spotted on the forecastle of a tanker anchored off Vietnam, attempting to lower a rope to fellow raiders. When crew raised an alarm, he climbed down and escaped in a motorboat. </p> <p>\u0095 Off the coast of Conakry, Guinea, nine men armed with shotguns attempted to board a bulk carrier. The ship's crew fired flares at their wooden boat, and they fled. </p> <p>Modern-day piracy - like that of old - requires organisation and funds. Impoverished fishermen cannot afford speedboats. The Foreign Office believes five or six gangs, some linked to Chinese triads, are behind some attacks. One gang operated from a mother-ship, where Indonesian police found handcuffs, masks, knives, immigration and ship stamps, and paint. Rogue regulators from flag-of-convenience states sell ship's papers for as little as $6,000. </p> <p>And the IMB points to evidence that rogue Chinese military units have, in the past, colluded with pirates. </p> <p>The Louisa was bound for China sailing on the South China Sea, out of Malaysia, with 5,000 tonnes of palm oil, when pirates struck in September 1998. A band of 25 toughs with automatic weapons, dressed in army camouflage and aboard what looked like a Chinese Navy boat boarded the Louisa. They accused the ship's master of smuggling illegal aliens and robbed him. They bound the crew and changed the name of the ship to 'Holly', flying Panama's flag. They kept the crew in fear of their lives for six days, then left with all that they could carry. </p> <p>IMB investigators were alarmed. Five months earlier, pirates 'shipjacked' the Petro Ranger, bound for Ho Chi Minh City with a cargo of jet fuel and diesel oil. The pirates, balaclava-clad, and armed with machetes, boarded from a speedboat and beat Australian captain Ken Blyth. As the ship sailed on, the intruders ate, drank and watched blue movies. Then Blyth's crew managed to contact Chinese authorities. The pirates were arrested - with paperwork for the 'Holly'. </p> <p>Captain Blyth was interrogated by two Chinese law enforcement agencies, the People's Liberation Army and the Public Security Bureau. One PSB officer even suggested he made up the pirate attack. The pirate gang, however, were released by the Chinese authorities - and, it seems, went on to attack the Louisa. The International Chamber of Commerce said it was 'a result of inefficiency and infighting amongst seemingly inept Chinese authorities concerned, or part of a deeper plot to cover up China's participation in criminal activity.' </p> <p>'We had evidence of collusion at the highest level,' said Captain Abhyankar. </p> <p>Named and shamed, the Chinese authorities hanged several suspects. </p> <p>Marine investigators now suspect that pirate loot is still being smuggled into China, via Vietnam. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the search for the missing Cheung Son continues, so far without luck. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.sweeney@observer.co.uk\">john.sweeney@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<b>Dave Hanrahan:</b> In my 22 years as a fencing coach, I never thought I'd get within spitting distance of the Olympics. <p> James first walked into my club, Cyrano, 14 years ago as an eager eight-year-old. His hand was unusually fast and I could see he had the confidence to win. A year later, I started giving him lessons in my garage in Essex, where I train my particularly good pupils. </p> <p> By day, I moonlight as a tax inspector in London, but after a quick cup of tea at home, the fencing begins. As well as two club sessions, I do three evenings in the garage, teaching for three hours at a time. It's an ordinary garage - washing machine, freezer, ladders on the wall - but we build up a tremendous atmosphere. Lessons with James are intensely competitive. Whereas an average lesson might last 15 minutes, we train for more than an hour, which often has James on his knees by the end. We're both perfectionists, and our need to achieve the perfect hit keeps us going. </p> <p> The 2000 Olympics became possible when the British Olympic Association awarded James a scholarship 18 months ago, allowing him to fight on the world circuit. Sydney was still a long shot - only 40 people get to compete - and James still had to get through the Olympic qualifying competition. I knew as long as I could keep him relaxed we had an outside chance. </p> <p>I am normally Mr Cool at competitions - my job is to watch and analyse the fight - but in the last minutes of James's final qualifying fight, I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. I just couldn't believe it. It's such an enormous thing to achieve - it's like the Lottery win. </p> <p> His success certainly feels like my glory, too. I honestly don't wish that I was the one going to Sydney to fence. I like the buzz of coaching, and I'm very happy to be the Svengali in the background, creating good, fully rounded fencers. </p> <p> Sadly, Olympic fencing is given very little television coverage in Britain. Because it has a strong public-school background, it is seen as an elitist sport. But the fact that a boy from the back end of Essex has got to this level proves that is not the case. We believe that James has a chance in the Olympics. I don't want to say he's going to win the gold, but anything's possible. James and I are a team with a shared vision - we've developed together, and we're definitely not going to Sydney as tourists. </p> <p> <b>James Beevers:</b> I did my first fencing in the back of a sick-animal dispensary with my grandad, who was an army fencing coach. My parents are both international fencers and they chose Dave to teach me. Cyrano is a serious club; the atmosphere's highly competitive. But I was enthusiastic, and from the moment I met Dave, I remember I just wanted to hit him! </p> <p> It felt like a real promotion when Dave suggested lessons in the garage. When I go to the club and train in the big gym, I get tired quickly. But in the garage I could go on all night. Because I come from a fencing family, I've got a natural flair, which gives me an edge over more robotic fencers. Dave also coaches my brother and sister, and my brother is now British under-18 champion. </p> <p> I won my first national competition when I was 11. Though I've learned to cope with the pressure at competitions, I like having Dave there to relax me and stop my hand from tightening up. My Olympic scholarship has meant I've been to a lot this year that Dave can't afford to attend. I get really annoyed that my coach isn't given the funding to come with me.</p> <p> Britain is just about the only country that doesn't provide adequate sponsorship for its fencers. I'm one of two British fencers going to the Olympics this year, but the only foil competitor. Before I got the scholarship, the 2000 Games weren't really a consideration, and I was extremely wound up at the qualifier. When I won, both Dave and I were in tears - I've never seen him so choked. It's just as much an achievement for him as it is for me. </p> <p> The last six months have been intense - I did a degree in English and art history, and I'm looking for a job in the media. As for fencing, it's a case of some intensive technique training and getting really fit. In Sydney, every round is direct elimination, so my entire Olympic career could last three minutes! I'm going as the underdog, but that's how I like it.</p> <p> Without so much pressure, it's easier to fence your best.</p>",
  "<p>It's taken 226 years. But next month, John Smedley, the British knitwear company renowned from Tokyo to Toronto, will open its first shop. Just along from Issey Miyake's Pleats Please, on London's chic Brook Street, it'll be slick and modern, designed by the cutting-edge architects Soft Room. And the rails will be crammed with brightly coloured New Zealand wool, Sea Island cotton and - exclusive to the shop - a few pieces of Smedley cashmere, the company's first steps into the more luxury end of the market. The Smedley celebrity hall of fame - including Paul Weller, Tom Cruise, Robbie Williams, Guy Ritchie and the Gallagher brothers - will have a new shopping destination. This small, two-storey shop is about to become Fashion Central. </p> <p>It is the start of a new era for a company that began in 1784 at the onset of the industrial revolution. Many of its staff have been with the company for years, and many are related to each other. Moreover, the business, with an annual turnover of \u00a315m, is family owned - the president is Andrew Marsden-Smedley, the chairman is his cousin Lowry Maclean - but instead of getting bogged down by family feuds, it has a team of professional managers to maintain the quality and tradition that have made the label a household name. </p> <p>For years, Smedley has manufactured limited editions and small runs for other fashion houses. It has been a secret weapon, quietly making knitwear for such designers as Yves Saint Laurent, Margaret Howell, Paul Smith, Agn\u00e8s b, Lanvin, as well as some of British fashion's more funky names, such as Antonio Berardi and Sonja Nuttall. </p> <p>But Smedley has never been seen as directional or trend-setting. Instead, you can always rely on the brand for a perfect polo shirt, a prim crew neck or a classic cardie. Fans will spend a few pounds extra for Smedleys because they won't shrink, turn into a bobbly mess or go all misshapen; they can be thrown in the wash and come out like new. Like Levi's, Doc Martens and Kangol berets, they are made to last. Nor will they go out of fashion. But this autumn, there is a new treat in store. There's the sparkle of Lurex, a sprinkling of sequins, the sexiness of a tie-neck, twinsets cut to cling rather than drape, necklines designed to flatter rather than cover, and colours that will make your mouth water. </p> <p>It's a radical departure for the Derbyshire-based company, which is still on its original site. The new look is the result of a collaboration between the head of design, Dawne Stubbs, and the London-based stylist Sally Courtis. Designers often use magazine stylists to work on their collections, but it is only in the past 10 years or so that Smedley has used a designer at all. Before that, the business was very technically based. Courtis, previously a fashion editor at Elle , was asked to consult on a capsule collection last year. And London's most fashionable boutiques, The Cross in west London, and Browns Focus on South Molton Street, are very impressed. 'I've used consultants to advise on colour,' says Stubbs, 'but never on style and styling. The idea was to do a capsule collection which would be just a step away from the main collection, but would be the icing on the cake. It has become a test bed for new yarns, designs and surface decoration.' </p> <p>It is amazing to see the process each Smedley jumper goes through before it is packed and boxed, ready to be shipped to Japan, Italy, America, or - if it hasn't quite made it past quality control - into the factory shop to be sold at bargain prices to coachloads of Japanese tourists. Each week, some 12,000 garments leave the factory. </p> <p>The process begins with bales of New Zealand superfine Merino wool, which are combed, conditioned and put on to big reels. The yarn is so fine you can't even see it spinning through the machines. It is lubricated to stop it snapping, and then goes into the knitting department, where the sleeve and collar ribs are knitted on ancient machines that are part of the Smedley secret. Next, a team of women put each rib on to machine knitting needles, stitch by stitch. Drop one stitch and the jumper will have a run in it. From there, the jumpers start to take shape on the 70-year-old knitting machines, which are gradually being replaced by new ones from Japan. The pieces are all joined together by hand and sent downstairs into the damp, sheep-smelling bowels of the factory to be washed, pressed and steamed. After that, each jumper has a neckline cut by hand, the trim attached and hand-stitched. After a final inspection under the magnifying glass, the jumpers are pressed and folded into a bag, ready for distribution. Each one goes through 35 different processes. If you unravelled your prized Smedley, you would find that the yarn stretches out for 4.5km. </p> <p>If the first John Smedley had been set up in America or Italy, it would have a turnover far in excess of \u00a315m. Lowry Maclean would be the chairman of a multi-million dollar empire. His office would be at the top of a skyscraper. There would be sunglasses, luggage, shoes, golf wear. There would be Smedley aftershave. We would have Smedley's jay bird logo coming out of our ears. As it is, the company is more interested in quality than quantity, and is still relatively small and happy to progress slowly into the 21st century. Smedley is determined to be around in another 200 years' time. </p> <p>But when the shop opens, be sure to get there early. Those capsule pieces with their sequin trims and Lurex threads will not hang around long. As for the cashmere, it could be the start of a beautiful relationship.</p> <p><strong>Stars who sport Smedley</strong></p> <p>Paul Weller </p> <p>Dave Stewart</p> <p>Vinnie Jones</p> <p>Tom Cruise</p> <p>Liam Gallagher</p> <p>Guy Ritchie</p> <p>Robbie Williams</p> <p>\u0095 John Smedley opens at 24 Brook Street, London W1 on 18 September</p>",
  "Twelve years ago, I visited an alternative health practitioner with some non-specific health symptoms. I'd hardly sat down before he told me that my diet needed radical attention - I had to cut out all dairy, wheat, alcohol and caffeine, and substitute protein in the form of soya milk and tofu instead. Nowadays this kind of advice is routine, but at the time, it seemed glamorously radical: I had to trek to Clapham's one health-food shop to stock up on soya milk because Sainsbury's certainly didn't have their own brand (as they do now) and veggie/soya sausages were just a glint in Linda McCartney's eye. <p>In the event, I lost a stack of weight and felt immensely rejuvenated. So much so that, four months later, I started eating normally again. Just as well, because it has now been found that soya - far from having the magical, health-giving properties that the alternative medicine brigade endlessly bangs on about - can actually be bad for you. Its reputation as an anti-cancer, cholesterol-lowering, osteoporosis-fighting, low-fat all round good egg of a product is based on bad science and superlative marketing by the powerful soya industry. </p> <p>Worldwide, the evidence is starting to stack up against soya. In this country, MAFF is so worried about the possible health problems of phytoestrogens in soya that they are funding a rolling programme of 19 separate research projects, due to end in 2002. Preliminary findings by Professor John Ashby of AstraZeneca Central Toxicology Laboratory in Macclesfield, for example, confirm that soya infant formula (currently the sole food of 6,500 British babies) has an oestrogenic effect on rats. According to public health minister Yvette Cooper, no new advice will be given on soya until the independent COT (Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment) has reviewed the programme's findings. </p> <p>This could take several years. Meanwhile, if you've been seduced by the message that soya is the healthy 21st-century superfood, read on...</p> <p><b> Is soya bad for you? </b></p> <p> It contains high quantities of various toxic chemicals, which cannot be fully destroyed even by the long cooking process. These are: phytates, which block the body's uptake of minerals; enzyme inhibitors, which hinder protein digestion; and haemaggluttin, which causes red blood cells to clump together and inhibits oxygen take-up and growth. Most controversially of all, soya contains high levels of the phytoestrogens (also known as isoflavones) genistein and daidzein, which mimic and sometimes block the hormone oestrogen. </p> <p> <b> Surely, the Japanese eat huge quantities of soya, and as a result have low rates of breast, uterus, colon and prostate cancers? </b></p> <p><b> </b> That's the big myth on which the idea of 'healthy' soya is built. In fact, the Japanese don't eat that much soya: a 1998 study showed that a Japanese man typically eats about 8g (2 tsp) a day, nothing like the 220g (8oz) that a Westerner could put away by eating a big chunk of tofu and two glasses of soya milk. Secondly, although Japanese people may have lower rates of reproductive cancers, this is thought to be due to other dietary and lifestyle factors: they eat less fatty meat, more fish and vegetables and fewer tinned or processed foods than in a typical Western diet. Thirdly, Asians have much higher rates of thyroid and digestive cancers, including cancer of the stomach, pancreas, liver and oesophagus. </p> <p> <b> I'm vegetarian and eat loads of tofu and soya milk. Should I stop? </b></p> <p> Soya has become vegetarians' meat and milk, the major source of protein in their diet. But eating soya actually puts vegetarians at severe risk of mineral deficiencies, including calcium, copper, iron, magnesium and especially zinc. According to Dr Mike Fitzpatrick, a New Zealand biochemist who runs a soya information website (see below), this is because soya contains high levels of phytic acid, which blocks the absorption of essential minerals in the digestive tract. To reduce the effects of a high-phytate diet, you need to eat, as the Japanese do, lots of meat or fish with tiny bits of soya. </p> <p><b> I'm intolerant to cow's milk, so should I drink soya milk instead? </b></p> <p> Soya has become the fashionable option for people 'intolerant' to dairy products. It's little known that soya is the second most common allergen. Only 1 per cent of the population is truly allergic to cows' milk and, of those, two-thirds will also be intolerant to soya milk. In addition, soya milk is high in aluminium. That's because the soya protein isolate it's made from is acid-washed in aluminium tanks. No wonder it tastes bad. </p> <p> <b> Can soya affect your thyroid? </b></p> <p> It's been known for years that phytoestrogens in soya depress thyroid function. In Japan, 1991 research showed that 30g of soya a day results in a huge increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone. This can cause goitre, hypothyroidism, and auto-immune thyroid disease. </p> <p> <b> I'm pregnant. Should I avoid soya? </b></p> <p> Probably, and especially if you're vegetarian. A new study of babies born to vegetarian mothers showed that baby boys had a five-fold risk of hypospadias, a birth defect of the penis. The researchers suggest this was due to greater exposure to phytoestrogen rich-foods, especially soya. Inappropriate hormone levels such as that caused by a high intake of soya during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy can also cause damage to the foetus's developing brain. </p> <p><b> But surely I can feed my baby soya formula? It must be safe: it's available in every supermarket and chemist. </b></p> <p><b> </b> Soya-fed babies are taking part in 'a large, uncontrolled and basically unmonitored human infant experiment', said Daniel Sheehan, director of the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, in 1998. A newborn baby's sole food is the milk it drinks: a soya-fed baby receives the equivalent of five birth control pills' worth of oestrogen every day, according to Mike Fitzpatrick. These babies' isoflavone levels were found to be from 13,000 to 22,000 times higher than in non-soya fed infants. </p> <p>As a result of this phytoestrogen overload, soya-fed babies have a two-fold risk of developing thyroid abnormalities including goitre and auto-immune thyroiditis. Boys risk retarded physical maturation, while girls risk early puberty (1 per cent of girls now show signs of puberty, such as breast development or pubic hair, before the age of three) and fertility. Researchers have also suggested that diabetes, changes in the central nervous system, extreme emotional behaviour, asthma, immune system problems, pituitary insufficiency and IBS may be caused by high phytoestrogen intake in early life. Last year, compounds in soya were also implicated in the development of infantile leukaemia. Current government advice is that breast is best and that soya formula should not be given to infants unless on the advice of a health professional. </p> <p><b> Can soya help with prostate cancer? </b></p> <p><b> </b> Ex-junk bond trader Michael Milken certainly thinks so. He consumes 40g of soya protein every day with that hope in mind. The science is less conclusive - a recent study on Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii showed that men who had eaten two or more servings of tofu a week during mid-life not only had 'accelerated brain ageing', and more than twice the incidence of Alzheimer's and dementia, but also looked five years older than those men who didn't. </p> <p> <b> My mother died of breast cancer and I've been advised by both mainstream and complementary medical sources that increasing my soya intake may offer me protection against the disease. Is this true? </b></p> <p> The evidence is highly inconclusive. In The Breast Cancer Protection Diet , published last year, Dr Bob Arnot states that eating between 35g and 60g of soya protein daily protects against breast cancer by raising intake of the oestrogen-blocker genistein. But this ignores contrary evidence. In 1996, research showed that women eating soya had an increased incidence of epithelial hyperplasia, a condition that presages malignancy. In 1997, genistein in the diet was also found to stimulate human breast cells to enter the cell cycle. As a result, the researchers advised women not to eat soya products to prevent breast cancer. </p> <p> <b> But surely soya prevents osteoporosis, the bone thinning that particularly affects post-menopausal women? </b></p> <p> No. In fact, soya blocks calcium and causes a deficiency of vitamin D, both of which are needed for strong bones, say American nutritionists and soya debunkers Sally Fallon and Mary G Enig. </p> <p> <b> Is there any kind of soya product I can safely eat? </b></p> <p> Yes. Fermented soya products, such as soy sauce, tempeh and miso. The long fermentation process counteracts the effects of natural toxins in soya. </p> <p><b> Can I avoid soya? </b></p> <p><b> </b> It's hard. You can stop eating the obvious candidates such as soya milk and tofu, but soya is also to be found in breakfast cereals, ice cream, convenience food such as hamburgers, fish fingers and lasagne, and all manner of baked goods from cakes and biscuits to tortillas and bread. If that's your mission in life, read labels carefully, and eat organic processed foods wherever possible. </p> <p> <b> Finally, the pro-soya lobby always says that, in the US, a quarter of the population has been fed infant soya formula for 30 to 40 years, with no adverse health problems. So why should I worry? </b></p> <p> Scientists are only just beginning to research and understand the harmful long-term effects that eating large quantities of soya can have on the human body. As Fallon and Enig write: 'The industry has know for years that soya contains many toxins. At first they told the public that the toxins were removed by processing. Then they claimed that these substances were beneficial.'

This is categorically not the case but Eastern said that, if Norweb had become my supplier incorrectly, Norweb was responsible for transferring me back.</p> <p>As I have not signed any gas supply contract with Norweb, I assume it cannot charge me for the gas it supplies, and presumably Eastern cannot charge me either as my contract ended with the final gas account. </p> <p>I am baffled about how my gas supplier can change without my knowledge, but, from talking to these two companies, I gained the impression that this may not be an uncommon problem.<strong> <br> SC, South Molton </strong></p> <p>Norweb confirms that erroneous transfers happen frequently. Switches from one gas provider to another take place through Transco where, if an account number is mistyped, the wrong customer is moved to a different supplier. But Norweb admits that Transco is not to blame on this occasion. Rather, its own staff typed in your meter reference number when they should have been transferring someone else, probably with the same surname. </p> <p>It then assumed you were still getting your gas from British Gas and tried to send you back there, which confused British Gas. This has all happened within the 28-day cooling-off period, so you never stopped being an Eastern customer and Eastern will charge for the gas you have used in that period. If the confusion had lasted longer and you had lost money through Norweb's mistake, the company confirms that it would make good its error. </p> <p><strong> Woolwich windfall: Perpetual problem</strong></p> <p> My Woolwich windfall shares are held within Perpetual Pep and I do not receive any communications from Woolwich.

  "<p>Anyone who has 'owned' a leasehold flat and dealt with an unscrupulous or incompetent landlord will have found that this can be a short route to near-madness. </p> <p>Last week the Government announced its Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill, whose proposals aim to help the 2 million people living in leasehold flats and houses. But will they work? </p> <p>First, the problem. Flat dwellers do not own the right to live in their homes forever. This stays with a landlord, or freeholder, and the building is often managed by a third party. </p> <p>The Government-backed Leasehold Advisory Service (LAS) receives 16,000 calls a year. Among the most common issues are: </p> <p>\u0095 Freeholders who do not carry out repairs. </p> <p>\u0095 Exorbitant repair and service charges. Failure to pay them can put at risk an owner's right to their home. </p> <p>\u0095 Shoddy repairs and maintenance. </p> <p>\u0095 Problems with buildings insurance. Freeholders set themselves up as 'brokers' to receive commission on the premiums and take a discount which is not passed on to the leaseholders. </p> <p>\u0095Often lenders will refuse to advance mortgages on flats with leases that still have a lifetime - up to 80 years - to run. </p> <p>\u0095 Red tape facing those buying freeholds from landlords. Two thirds of the flat owners in a block must agree. Half of the participating leaseholders must have lived in their flats as their main, or only, home for the last year, or periods totalling three years in the last 10. Peter Hayler, LAS chief executive, says this process is 'slow and cumbersome'. </p> <p>\u0095 Criticisms of the length of time tribunals take to settle disputes over service charges and extending or buying freeholds. Sly landlords and their solicitors know how to milk the system. </p> <p>The Government aims to solve the problems by: </p> <p>\u0095 Allowing flat dwellers to take control of the management of their buildings as long as half of them agree. </p> <p>\u0095 Letting leaseholders buy their freeholds if half of them want to. There will be no requirement for those voting in favour to have lived in the properties for a certain period. </p> <p>It will be easier for flats in blocks that are part-commercial, part-residential to buy their freehold. </p> <p>\u0095 Simplifying the complicated mechanism for valuing freeholds and extensions to leases. </p> <p>\u0095 Introducing a new form of ownership, called commonhold. Leaseholders can convert to commonhold, but only if 100 per cent of those in a property, and the landlord, agree. Developers on new blocks can choose commonhold or leasehold. </p> <p>But Joan South of the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association is unhappy about the planned reforms. She called them 'a disgrace' because they fail to abolish leasehold altogether. </p> <p>And the measure that would give flat owners the right to manage their properties will be ineffective because the landlord must remain involved, Smith said. </p> <p>'In most blocks where people want the right to manage, the relationship would have broken down already. It will end in endless litigation.' </p> <p>Another campaigner, who asked not to be named because of a legal dispute he is having with his freeholder, described the proposals as 'absolutely inadequate'. </p> <p>The LAS's Hayler, who has been involved in a working party assisting with drafting the Bill, said the campaigners' demands are unrealistic. Unless the Government put up money to buy out every landlord's freehold, it would be impossible to abolish this form of tenure overnight. </p> <p>However, he identified some weaknesses. It would have been preferable to outlaw leasehold ownership in new blocks. Hayler would like to have seen statutory regulation for managers of flats. </p> <p>David Hewett of the Association of Residential Managing Agents agrees, although he is generally positive about the proposals. Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy of the National Association of Estate Agents believes the changes would enhance the saleability of flats. A solicitor who acts for developers of new blocks agrees. </p> <p>With so many members of the property 'establishment' lined up in favour of the Bill, there must be a suspicion that the landlords have won again. As long as leaseholders feel compelled, out of dissatisfaction with the way their homes are being cared for, to confront freeholders there is potential for conflict. </p> <p>Campaigners can be forgiven for fearing that landlords will prove themselves adept at flouting the new legislation. </p> <p>But it is not just landlords that flat owners have to fear. As they obtain increased powers to manage their properties they also take on heavier responsibilities. Many a flat owner is familiar with the difficulties of obtaining agreement among fellow residents to buy out freeholds and have repairs done. </p> <p>Hayler accepted that this is a problem, and will remain so. In other countries where the commonhold system is well established, co-owners are much more willing to attend meetings and participate in decision-making. </p> <p>In the US there are even special management courses for commonhold managers. </p> <p>Last week's Bill skews the balance of power a little further in favour of flat dwellers in England and Wales (leasehold does not exist in sensible Scotland). But it will take time to become effective. Meanwhile, buying a flat will require vigilance about how the building is run, and by whom. </p> <p> The Bill can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.open.gov.uk/lcd\">www.open.gov.uk/lcd</a></p>",
  "<p>When Richard Rooney's elderly mother died a little over a year ago and the family house was sold he was faced with choices about what to do with his future. </p> <p>Richard, 48 and single, had cared for his mother for several years before her death. One option was to stay in England 'buy a matchbox and keep working eight days a week, but never get further ahead'. The other was to move to the Mediterranean, where he has been holidaying in Greece for several years. Richard had also lived in Italy as a child when his father was in the RAF. </p> <p>He feels he has researched his new home well enough to feel confident that his decision to leave England will pay off. He did not return to his Greek holiday spots to live, but chose Crete, where he had not lived before, because it was large enough to have plenty to do. </p> <p>'Other islands were a bit too small.' He is determined to become integrated into Greek life and chose his home, the town of Agia Fotia, because it is not in the thick of the tourist trade. He believes that learning Greek will be 'absolutely essential'. </p> <p>'The town is a Cretan working town that also allows tourists. If you want to buy a length of hosepipe you have to talk to the local shop owners.

He is thinking of investing in olive trees and may work with a local English teacher who hopes to pay him to help her students with conversation. Richard says he talked to people who had moved abroad and was told about the pitfalls. </p> <p>If Greece can be a financial struggle for the under-researched, those with relatively modest pensions can do well there.Barbara (who does not want to be named) moved to Crete five years ago after taking early retirement. She has a pension of about \u00a36,000 a year, on which, she says: 'I manage very well.' She drives a second-hand car and she finds utilities inexpensive. </p> <p>'Water is metered, but it's not expensive. Electricity is not expensive as long as you don't have every room air conditioned. Two or three times a week I go out with friends to eat. We avoid tourist places but the food is excellent and never costs more than \u00a33 a head.' </p> <p>Barbara says newcomers can come unstuck when renovating houses. </p> <p>'With my first house I came a cropper.

It's first seen from a train as a corn circle in a field, then as a giant Catherine wheel, as a pattern drawn on a beach, and finally, when he spins out of control, as a sculpture he creates from plastic binliners in a Shepherd's Bush street. </p> <p>Craig's sad, unsentimental Ray is complemented by Morrissey's concerned, frequently exasperated brother, whose own life as hard-working caf\u00e9 owner, diligent son and rejected husband has been no bed of roses. The film's final sequence, in which the pair are reconciled as they cook an omelette together, is reminiscent of the end of Stanley Tucci's Big Night. Some Voices is accompanied by Bring Me Your Love, a short directed by Morrissey, also set in a mental hospital. This brief study in bad faith and self-deception stars Ian Hart as a journalist visiting his troubled wife. It's well worth seeing, though less impressive than Morrissey's earlier short, the historical anecdote A Secret Audience. </p> <p>Every comedian from Chaplin and Keaton through Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Bob Hope and Martin and Lewis, down to the Carry On team and Mel Brooks has made a spoof western. Now Jackie Chan, though at 46 a trifle old to respond to the injunction 'Go west, young man', has followed the trail with Shanghai Noon. It's virtually a transposition to Nevada of his last movie, Rush Hour , where he played a Hong Kong cop assisting a member of the LAPD to find the kidnapped daughter of a Chinese consul. </p> <p>Here he's Chon Wang (pronounced 'John Wayne'), a member of the Imperial Guard, lowliest member of a team sent from the Forbidden City in 1881 to rescue a Chinese princess (Lucy Liu of Ally McBeal fame) whisked away to Nevada. His first act there is to frustrate a train robbery and join forces with one of the thieves, a laidback outlaw played by Robert Red ford lookalike Owen Wilson. The ramshackle plot links a succession of carefully choreographed fights, there's a comic reprise of the finale of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , and there are patronising jokes at the expense of Native Americans of a sort we haven't heard for years. Terence Young's Red Sun (teaming Toshiro Mifune and Charles Bronson) and the TV series Kung Fu handled the idea of an Asian on the American frontier with greater dignity and more wit. The best thing about Shanghai Noon is its title. </p> <p>Exactly 40 years ago this month, Hitchcock's seminal Psycho exploded on the world, and its latest grandchild, Cherry Falls, arrives as a birthday present. It's an unpleasant creature that comes knife in hand and tongue in cheek, a version of those slasher flicks, usually starring Jamie Lee Curtis, in which revenge for some depredation of 10 or 20 years back is taken on apparently innocent teenagers, usually while they're having, or have just had, sex. </p> <p>The joke here is that the remorseless killer (a woman or a man in drag) is deliberately targeting virgins in the comically named Cherry Falls, Virginia. The principal of the local high school (who is one of the half-dozen or more suspects) fears that if word gets out 'we'll have a goddam fuck-fest on our hands'. It does, and 'we're talking hymen holocaust here' as one female pupil says, while her friends are preparing a 'Pop Your Cherry Party'. Australian filmmaker Geoffrey Wright directs as if swinging a cleaver, and a typical joke has a cop being cut in twain with an axe half-a-second after he's said: 'This is my post, I can't just split.' There are just two killings in Psycho. Cherry Falls has upwards of a dozen; I lost count. </p> <p>In Davis Guggenheim's slick, empty, dislikeable thriller, Gossip, a trio of smart undergraduates at a New York university concoct a story about two fellow students as a class exercise (they're studying the way rumours circulate). They unleash a horrific train of events in a convoluted movie in which the emphasis is on the 'con'.</p>",
  "<p>On 18 September 1970, the rock world was shaken by the news of Jimi Hendrix's death. It had been known for some months he'd been in an increasingly bad way due to the escalating amount of drugs he was using, and his recent appearance at the Isle of Wight Festival had been largely panned, but nobody was prepared for this. In a basement flat in Notting Hill his girlfriend, Monika Dannemann, woke up, couldn't rouse him and called an ambulance. Hendrix was pronounced dead upon arrival at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. Possessed of an extraordinary musical talent that was still developing, he'd only been in Britain for four years. </p> <p>His death, on 18 September 1970, stunned a business that, apart from Brian Jones's drowning in 1969, hadn't yet been hit by the relentless overdose toll of the Seventies. The anniversary will be marked next month by a flurry of reminiscences in the mainstream and music press. I was working on a music paper when it happened and had met Hendrix a few times. Contrary to his initially scary appearance - so cool, so wild, so amazingly dressed - and powerful on-stage presence (I've seen his opening chord cause a nosebleed), he was gentle, courteous (a door opener, a stand-up-when-you-entered-a-room guy) and shy. </p> <p>Probably the most famous image of him is the one here, taken in calmer and more lucid times for Hendrix back in 1967. It was a photo session organised for his first album Are You Experienced , taken against a plain backdrop one lazy afternoon. Nobody, particularly the photographer Gered Mankowitz, could realise what an iconic image it would become. </p> <p>The session had come about through a mixture of location and Mankowitz's growing reputation as a rock photographer. His tiny studio in Mason's Yard, just off Piccadilly, was next to one of the hippest clubs of the time, the Scotch of St James, and close to the offices of Hendrix's manager, Chas Chandler. </p> <p>Says Mankowitz: 'Chas was a hard-assed Newcastle bloke, nice, straight who had been the bass player with the Animals. I'd never photographed them, but done some work with him. He told me he'd found this phenomenal guitarist who was extraordinary looking, who he reckoned was going to be huge. </p> <p>'I went down to the Bag O'Nails to see him. It was a seething mass of people because word had got around: Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton were all there. And Jimi was mesmerising. I'm not sure if it was his music as much as his style - he was doing things with a guitar that had never been done before.' </p> <p>In the late Sixties and early Seventies the music business was small and contained. Everybody knew each other and hung out together, so news of this remarkable new guitarist went round like wildfire. A friend, Yardbird bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, remembers a hilarious impromptu evening jamming with Hendrix as a background to some Scaffold poetry with, incredibly, Jane Asher's mother on violin. There were no VIP areas in clubs, no bouncers, no security guards. You were quite likely to run into Hendrix or Jagger buying clothes in Granny Takes a Trip, or rummaging for antique shirts and coats in Chelsea Antiques Market. </p> <p>Mankowitz, 20 in 1967, in his Take Six velvet suits and perennial dark glasses was very much part of the scene. He was truly cool because he was never starstruck due to growing up surrounded by the stars that inhabited the world of his film-producer father, Wolf Mankowitz. Gered had done film stills on sets, toured America with the Rolling Stones in 1965 and photographed Marianne Faithfull. </p> <p>He'd acquired his first floor studio in Mason's Yard when he was 17. Painted brown and white with orange water pipes, on the landing there was a blown-up comic image of Batman with a bubble coming out of his mouth saying: 'It's as well to remember that evil is a pretty bad thing.' It was a hip hangout. Rock stars would often call in on their way to the Scotch, smoke some dope and carry on their way. </p> <p>For the Are You Experienced session Hendrix arrived with bass player Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell at around midday: nobody ever got up much before about then. They were wearing the clothes they were to be photographed in and wore them to a gig later (they weren't well off and didn't possess that many) and make-up artists, PAs and stylists were unknown commodities then. </p> <p>'It was all very relaxed. I always got some food in from Fortnum and Mason round the corner, and we smoked some dope and took the pictures. It wasn't difficult to capture Jimi's image because he exuded this extraordinary power and charisma - the guy just took hold of the camera. </p> <p>'People are naturally nervous in front of a camera and Jimi was no different. He didn't like it much, and he didn't smile because the whole idea of it was to appear cool and moody - we wanted to be the antithesis of the publicity photograph. The famous smoking shot was with an ordinary cigarette - you had to be really careful in those days and it would have been irresponsible to publish a picture of someone smoking a joint, although I do have a picture of Keith Richards with one.' </p> <p>A couple of months later, Mankowitz did the second Hendrix studio session - an indication of how intensively he was being worked. 'I'd seen him around in clubs and he'd always pop in to the studio for a smoke on his way to the Scotch. We'd chat, gossip. I liked him a lot. He had no side to him, no hidden agenda. He was a good guy.' </p> <p>Little did Mankowitz realise the value of his photographic archive which moved from studio to studio in plastic carrier bags. His father had advised him to never throw anything away, so he stowed the bags in the corner and gradually the Sixties and Seventies began to gain iconic status. Mankowitz started to exhibit the pictures of Hendrix, the Stones, Marianne, Kate Bush, Eric Clapton and many others. He organised the prints into limited editions and collectors started to pour in. He also got together with graphic designer David Costa (son of DJ Sam) and produced a series of silk screen prints from the pictures. Inevitably there is piracy. Sometimes Mankowitz is successful in reclaiming or charging for the use of his images, more often in the case of T-shirts and posters the process is too complicated. The Hendrix legacy is now big business run by his family, and there is a museum in his birthplace of Seattle. </p> <p>For the older generation remembering how you heard of Hendrix's death ranks alongside Lennon and Kennedy. </p> <p>'By the time he died a lot of people were accidents waiting to happen,' says Mankowitz. 'Hendrix was appallingly overworked and not cared for properly. The whole cult status thing is a madness, not an easy thing to live with and he could have gone on to do extraordinary things.'</p> <p><strong>Hendrix: The life</strong></p> <p><strong> Born </strong> 1942 Seattle</p> <p><strong> Died </strong> 1970 London </p> <p><strong> Music:</strong> Self-taught guitarist who become one of the biggest musical influences of all time.

  "<p>What does TI Group, one of the few world-class engineers left in Britain, have to do? Interim results this month easily topped market expectations and TI also promised double-digit profit growth for the year, after a cracking performance from automotive components. </p> <p>Yet the shares have since dropped from 370p to 333.5p - 40 per cent off their value just 12 months ago. Blame it on the dog days of August if you like; now looks a good time to buy, before the market gets back into full swing after the holidays. </p> <p>Trading at just nine times earnings, the shares are cheap on fundamentals. But there may also be rumblings on the corporate front. Frustrated by the market's measly valuation, chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton is canvassing all options, including disposals, splitting the automotive and aerospace arms in two and even a management buy-out. That, in turn, means TI is up for grabs if a serious bidder emerges. And there are plenty of US and European engineers who'd surely love to grab TI's strong market positions. Broker Henderson Crosthwaite puts a 450p valuation on the shares. UBS Warburg thinks 550p is right. </p> <p><strong> Sherwood spurt</strong><br> take a look at Sherwood International, the software group. Despite a tough industry background, the interims showed solid growth. Yet the shares have eased to 725p. </p> <p>That's not to say, by conventional yardsticks, that the shares are cheap. But, trading on around 50 times earnings, Sherwood stands at a discount to its peers. And it has similar growth prospects to the likes of Sage and London Bridge, thinks broker HSBC. </p> <p>Analysts are most excited about prospects for e2-One, the venture set up to market Sherwood's Aeos online broking software outside the insurance industry. </p> <p>HSBC has set a target price of 900p and ABN Amro also rates the shares a 'buy'. </p> <p><strong> Emap hits form</strong><br> Publisher Emap is another whose shares have eased over the summer when there is little to grumble about. </p> <p>New circulation figures for Emap's magazines are ahead of market expectations. FHM continues to widen its lead over IPC's Loaded . Smash Hits is benefiting from cross-promotion with The Box, Emap's TV music channel. Emap has also aggressively raised cover prices on its strongest-growing publications, which bodes well for revenue growth. </p> <p>Broker UBS Warburg values the shares at 1700p, while rival Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's 12-month price target is not far off at 1680p. Those values match Emap's peak at the start of the year and represent a 50 per cent upside on today's 1117p. </p> <p><strong> S&amp;N bubbling</strong><br> Scottish &amp; Newcastle, our biggest brewer, has had a busy year. After buying Kronenbourg from French food group Danone last month, last week it snapped up Portugal's biggest brewer. Now the group is on the verge of flogging off Center Parcs holiday camps to another French outfit for \u00a3700m or so. </p> <p>New executive chairman Brian Stewart must be hoping that that deal perks up S&amp;N's share price. The stock has slipped 20 per cent since June, when the Kronenbourg euphoria was overtaken by worries that the \u00a31.7 billion price tag was too high. </p> <p>But Kronenbourg, remember, gives market leadership in France, plus Alken Maes and Peroni, the number two beers in Belgium and Italy. And there's also the chance of taking Danone's interest in Spanish number two San Miguel in due course. </p> <p>Strategically, it's hard to fault S&amp;N's footwork. If it doesn't perform, the group will be an attractive target for giants such as Anheuser Busch. The shares should be tucked away for the medium term.</p>",
  "<p>The day traders are restive. The bulletin boards are up in arms. The internet is positively revolting. What's sparked the outcry? An end to share tips on <a href=\"http://www.Sharepages.com\" target=\"_new\">Sharepages.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Digitallook.com\" target=\"_new\">Digitallook.com</a>, two of the burgeoning number of financial websites, courtesy of the suits in hobnail boots at the Financial Services Authority (FSA). </p> <p>From some of the press reports last week, readers may indeed have gained the impression that the regulators were now cracking down in the most cackhanded, discriminatory and Canute-likefashion on the net. And why pick on just these two? After all, they were simply printing round-ups of newspaper tips. So why should that constitute giving 'unauthorised financial advice'? </p> <p>What about the papers themselves? And other websites, like <a href=\"http://www.Breakingviews.com\" target=\"_new\">Breakingviews.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Sharecast.com\" target=\"_new\">Sharecast.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.TheStreet.com\" target=\"_new\">TheStreet.com</a>? And, for that matter, <a href=\"http://www.FT.com\" target=\"_new\">FT.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.GuardianUnlimited.co.uk\">GuardianUnlimited.co.uk</a> and all Fleet Street's online shadows? Or, indeed, the venerable Reuters news agency, which produces its own round-up of Sunday newspaper tips for traders at the start of every week. </p> <p>The reality, however, is less dramatic. For a long time the FSA has been concerned about the net. It would be nonsensical if it weren't. After all, a year ago there were no online brokers and now they number 30-plus. Flotations are being handled over the net. And, of course, insider information - or juicy titbits dressed up as such - is increasingly being posted anonymously on the web, with share prices gyrating wildly as a result. </p> <p>The travails of Dan Wagner's old Dialog site (now Brightstation.com, see graph) through the net rumour mill are legendary. Deals like Reckitt &amp; Colman's merger with Benckiser have broken on bulletin boards, prompting hasty announcements. So the FSA is quite right to try, at least, to 'police the net'. It's nothing to do with stopping free speech. It's about stopping market manipulation. And market abuse usually means it's the ordinary punters, including many now mouthing off on the net, who get suckered. </p> <p>Since its inception three years ago, the FSA has been in constant dialogue with financial websites. And what happened last week was that, in the course of talks, Sharepages voluntarily withdrew its own summary and spin on newspaper tips. Digitallook.com, meanwhile, had altered its service nine months ago. So, presto, there was no 'crackdown' or 'net blackout', despite the dramatic headlines. And importantly - if you do use the web for tips - there's also no implication, therefore, that one site is 'safer' or more reliable than another simply because it's not been 'cracked down on'. </p> <p>The truth is, in this greyest of areas, that the FSA has to make do with legislation - the Financial Services Act 1986 - drawn up when the world wide web was but a twinkle in a spider's eye. At the moment - for the protection of investors - no one can give 'investment advice' unless they are registered with and regulated by the FSA. Newspapers and magazines are specifically exempt and can tip shares, as long as this is not their principal business. It's an anomaly, certainly, and one highlighted by the antics of the Mirror 's ex-City Slickers. But it's one the FSA, for now, has to live with. </p> <p>So, for financial websites, there are two ways to go. Register with the FSA, as some popular sites like Hemscott.net and Interactive Investor already have and others, such as Sharecast and Sharepages, are now doing. Or get yourself registered as a newspaper. This, however, is where the present law falls down. Websites have taken to scribbling issue numbers in page corners to try to satisfy definitions of what constitutes a periodical or publication under present law. </p> <p>Pragmatically, the FSA exempts the likes of FT.com, because it is part of a newspaper group. Pragmatically, too, Reuters poses no problem as it has a long track record of objective reporting. But the FSA appreciates that in today's environment this is arbitrary, to say the the least. And that's why there's been no crackdown, but rather a behind-the-scenes dialogue. </p> <p>Not before time, the law is now finally about to embrace the net. Next month, the Treasury will consult on an updated list of exemptions before the new Financial Markets Bill becomes law next year. So there's no reason why online news services shouldn't be treated like their newsprint rivals. Furthermore, either by legislation or through tightening of the Press Complaints Commission's Code of Practice, share-dealing by press tipsters is either going to be restricted or better disclosed. And everyone - in the markets, in Fleet Street or on the net - will be caught by new civil powers to prevent 'market abuse'. </p> <p>Naturally, there are many on the net who say, why bother? Let caveat emptor apply. People are smart enough not to be taken in by scurrilous rumours. That, however, is an argument against any regulation at all and, the trouble is, people do get taken to the cleaners. </p> <p>Clearly, investors who use bulletin boards should always be wary, and realise that a website's registration with the FSA is no guarantee of either good advice or a con-free zone. Before dealing on internet tips, readers should see FSA's succinct warning about bulletin boards. Go to <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk\">www.fsa.gov.uk</a>, click on 'Consumer Help', then 'What's New' for 'Consumer Alerts'. </p> <p><strong> Shake-out survivor</strong><br> Whither Durlacher, the pioneering broker whose fortunes are most closely identified with the net? After a breathtaking rise at the height of dotcom mania, Durlacher's shares have since plummeted in the shake-out. To phrase the question in quite those terms, however, is to miss the point. </p> <p>The broker, headed by Geoffrey Chamberlain, is no more finished because the market's come to its senses than any pilot who makes a safe landing. And, remember, investors have still done exceedingly well out of Durlacher's impressive seven-year rise as nurturer of internet start-ups and flotations. </p> <p>Known for backing success stories like Autonomy and 365 Corp, Durlacher is now using its expertise to mould and take far bigger stakes in technology companies. The latest is KVault Software, which helps firms archive and retrieve emails using technology first developed at Compaq. There's life, therefore, in Durlacher yet. Like the internet, the firm's developing all the time.</p>"
