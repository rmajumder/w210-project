  "<p>Kapil Dev, one of the giants of Indian cricket, says he has walked away from a game that has been \"murdered\". The man who led his country to their triumph in the 1983 World Cup, and was national coach until he resigned on Tuesday after being questioned over alleged match-fixing, has poured scorn on the Board of Control for Cricket in India. </p> <p>In his resignation letter Kapil, the former world record holder for Test wickets and the man who has sent down more deliveries in Tests than any other, said he was \"being put down on every occasion\" by his employers. </p> <p>\"I have taken what came to me,\" he said in an emotional letter to the BCCI president A C Muttiah, \"but I would request the board to be kinder to the next coach and give him his due respect if they have the welfare of the game at heart. </p> <p>\"This is not a battle of flexing our muscles. The game which has been murdered has to be slowly brought back to life.\" </p> <p>Kapil has been under investigation by the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the match-fixing scandal that has blighted world cricket. </p> <p>Last May he was reduced to uncontrollable weeping during a television interview when answering allegations of impropriety made by another former India all-rounder, Manoj Prabhakar. </p> <p>Two months later his home was raided by tax officials, and last week the CBI questioned him further about Prabhakar's evidence. Kapil has consistently denied any wrongdoing. </p> <p>\"The game that gave me everything has now taken its pound of flesh,\" he said in his letter. \"I now go without looking back, and will be happy if the board would not associate me in any way with its future plan of events connected to cricket.\" </p> <p>Kapil said he had wanted to wait until his name had been cleared before resigning \"as I did not want it to look like some sort of admission of guilt\". But the coaching camp for next month's ICC Knockout Trophy begins this week and he did not wish to start something he could not finish. </p> <p>He has been replaced by the former coach Anshuman Gaekwad while an overseas replacement is sought.</p>",
  "<p>New figures showing unemployment at a 20-year low and an easing in wage inflation were seized upon by ministers last night desperate to switch attention from the mounting crisis over fuel and the debacle of the millennium dome. </p> <p>In a double piece of good economic news, the office for national statistics announced that unemployment had fallen to a 20-year low while tight pay deals are keeping wage inflation firmly under control.</p> <p>The number of people out of work and claiming benefit last month fell by 18,000 to stand at 1,051,300, while the proportion of the workforce claiming benefit has fallen to 3.6%, its lowest since October 1975.</p> <p>Employment minister Tessa Jowell hailed the figures as adding to the government's \"sustained record of achievement\" while the TUC general secretary John Monks said the figures were \"excellent news\" and showed that full employment was now attainable.</p> <p>The claimant count has fallen by an average of nearly 20,000 a month since June, according to the ONS, raising hopes among Labour strate gists that it will fall below the key 1m level by Christmas.</p> <p>On the government's preferred measure on unemployment, based on the labour force survey, the number of people looking for work has also declined. The internationally comparable rate of unemployment fell to 5.3% in the three months to July, from the 5.7% of the previous three months.</p> <p>The tightening labour market does not appear to be sparking wage inflation. The ONS said average earnings increased by 3.9% in the year to July, a fall from the 4.1% rate recorded the previous month. The last time earnings were rising this slowly was August 1996 when the annual rate was 3.7%.</p> <p>Economists said the subdued earnings figures strengthened the chances that interest rates would be kept on hold.</p>",
  "<p>John Osborne once described a play as \"impossibly French\". I'd call Yasmina Reza's piece, first seen in Paris in 1987, as exquisitely Gallic. It is exactly like one of those delicate Eric Rohmer movies in which little happens on the surface but where by the end a whole set of relationships has been exposed and subtly changed. </p> <p>The title is exactly right: six people gather in the Loire countryside for a family funeral. Three of them are siblings and it becomes clear that there is a dark rivalry between Alex, an agitated literary critic, and the older Nathan who is a Nanterre lawyer. In part it stems from the enigmatic Elisa who was Alex's mistress and now loves Nathan: much of the tension stems from whether Elisa, whose car has broken down, will stay the night and in which bed. Watching helplessly are Edith, sister to the fractious brothers, their ageing uncle and his nervously new wife. </p> <p>Death, said Hazlitt, cancels everything but truth; and part of Reza's point is that it forces antique grudges, failures and longings into the open. Above all, you sense the heavy hand of the dead father on his three unmarried, middle-aged children. The neurasthenic Alex was expected to be a writer but settled for the quieter pastures of criticism. Nathan was the precociously brilliant older brother who lapsed into the law. Even Edith, who has a transient lover, sees herself as \"a dried-up old apple.\" While parents are alive, suggests Reza, we nurse our disappointments: once they are dead our alibis are gone. </p> <p>It may not display Reza's cutting edge. But it is poignant, graceful, wise: one notices the quiet skill with which Reza implies the marriage of the uncle, Pierre, is built on shifting sands. And Christopher Hampton's translation highlights the play's self-consciously literary quality: at one point the marooned Elisa remarks that her enforced return is like something out of a novel and when Pierre refers to Alex's \"rattlesnake compliments\" one is clearly meant to relish the choice phrase. </p> <p>Howard Davies's production, with an autumnal set by Rob Howell, is acted with finesse. The delicious Amanda Root is not my idea of a fading spinster, but Paul Higgins as the Hamletesque Alex and Matthew Marsh as the assured Nathan spar convincingly, Clare Holman is suitably mysterious as Elisa, and it is luxury casting to have David Calder as the Baudelaire-quoting uncle and Claire Bloom radiating stylish insecurity as his wife. All lend Reza's elegant text an elegiac Chekhovian sadness. </p> <p>Until October 21. Box office: 020-7359 4404.</p>",

  "<p>At the end of 1998, two FT.com executives were having a drink at the bar of the Pudong Shangri-La hotel in Shanghai, lamenting the difficulties of doing business far from home.</p> <p>Almost two years later, Donal Smith and Jonathan Schmidt are about to launch eCountries (due September 28), an internet business designed to address those complaints. As media executives wrack their brains at trying to turn their content-rich sites into money-makers, eCountries may have outfoxed the opposition with its admirably direct premise.</p> <p>Sometimes described as an online version of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which also churns out country analyses, eCountries is a site that provides news and analysis for 150 countries. As with most publishers, the information comes free of charge. The site consists of profiles on countries from Austria to Venezuela and up-to-date news feeds.</p> <p>eCountries is hoping to attract traffic by being listed on various news sites such as ABC.com and would eventually like to license its content to news outlets that have trimmed their foreign coverage. But the ace up the company's sleeve is its Marketplace matchmaking service for companies wishing to do business on foreign turf. </p> <p>Marketplace seeks to take the hassle out of international transactions, sparing companies the trials and tribulations that afflicted Smith, 38, and Schmidt, 36, during their dealmaking for FT.com years ago. Matchmaking has proved to be a successful formula for technology and internet networking group First Tuesday and eCountries has taken the concept further by adding a global twist.</p> <p>\"There is a large volume of international professional services that gets traded,\" Mr Smith said from eCountries's headquarters in Clerkenwell, the area of London where internet companies are proliferate as fast as the trendy cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood. \"But the market is very disaggregated. The internet is a fantastic way of introducing buyers and sellers to each other.\"</p> <p>Say a British company needs a translation of Bulgarian telecommunications legislation in a hurry - an actual request that came to eCountries recently. The company then fills in a form at the eCountries site and eCountries will try and come up with matches for appropriate services; at least two or three. </p> <p>If the transaction is completed, eCountries takes a cut of up to 10% of the fees. Transactions are expected to range from \u00a35,000 to \u00a3100,000, with eCountries counting on commissions to make up at least half of revenues.</p> <p>Other companies have spotted the potential for business matchmaking via the net. Business.com and Work.com are doing something similar for firms in the US. The two American companies have constructed big directories organised around business topics and plan to place partners' services and news feeds around these databases. But shrewdly, eCountries has its eye on the global market.</p> <p>With cross-border trade growing, eCountries believes there is plenty of scope for its venture as companies seek out reliable lawyers, accountants and other professionals in the countries in which they are doing business. </p> <p>Building up a database of service providers from accountancy firms to law firms was tough at first. It took six months to sign up the first supplier, but then momentum built up and eCountries now has about 400 service providers in its database, which covers four areas: legal translation and market research; recruitment; property services and insurance; and financial services. When a client posts a request on the site, it will get, at the very least, a global and a regional player in the specified sector.</p> <p>Great care is taken to vet the companies for marketplace. Of the 400 Russian companies suggested for eCountries's marketplace, only 50 survived the cull. In the most important part of the vetting process, a candidate who wishes to be included has to provide references from three companies with which it has done business. </p> <p>Clients \"are entering a walled garden for vetted suppliers,\" said Smith, who sold a broadcast monitoring business to Pearson in 1995 for \u00a34m and then went on to run the company's FT.com subsidiary. Schmidt, meanwhile, founded Asia Intelligence Wire and ran the Asian division of the Financial Times. </p> <p>eCountries expects to break even by 2002. Investors like the look of the top team, which includes Michael Elliott, the editor-in-chief, who jumped ship as international editor of Newsweek to get involved. He had no qualms about joining the new venture. </p> <p>\"I'd become more and more thrilled by the possibilities of the net,\" he said, \"Especially by its ability to be a global distribution mechanism for international news and information and I thought, 'If I don't make the leap into something new now, I never will.' I'm having a blast.\"</p> <p>eCountries has undoubtedly hit upon a good idea. The dual keys to success will be the thoroughness of its vetting process to keep out less-than-reputable companies and of course, whether people use the service. </p> <p>It could be cheaper and easier to conduct searches on the net and call up a few local companies, though there is no guaranteed safety net like with eCountries. If companies want their hand held as they strike out into new markets, eCountries could be their guide.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.eCountries.com/\">eCountries</a></p>",
  "<p> The Long Wait between two embryos being placed in my womb and finding out if either of them had implanted, meaning I was pregnant, wasn't as long as I expected. On the 10th day, I started bleeding. </p> <p>First I swore a lot. Then took revenge on the medical procedure I had been subjected to for months. I stopped inserting a progesterone pessary every night, \"to make the uterus lining as receptive as possible to the embryos\". I threw out my folic acid. I staggered up to the attic to make a pile of those things I would have to give away - the high chair, the box of baby clothes, the unbleached eco-friendly re-usable nappies, as if I were any more likely to use this ridiculous fop to world environmental destruction the second time around. </p> <p>I was clearing out my life, moving on, and in that way in felt good. But maudlin and awash with self-pity, I wrote in my diary: \"Today seems unbearably long. I cannot wait for the time when this sadness is gone.\" </p> <p>On the 12th day after my embryo transfer, I did a pregnancy test. The clinic requires it. </p> <p>The blue line was so strong I thought it must be faulty. I sent my boyfriend out to buy another. The blue line was just as strong. The bleeding, said the doctors, was one of those inexplicable things; despite what the textbooks say, there's no such thing as normal. I am pregnant. </p> <p>Now, a week or so later, I see the confusion surrounding my pregnancy test as a reminder, a warning even. Everything in this world is down to chance - especially childbirth. </p> <p>We like to think that we can control almost everything. Infertility treatment both bolsters and confounds this hope. It promises to overcome the chance of barrenness. Yet, infertility itself unsettles all our plans. It wasn't supposed to be that way. Aged 41, I wasn't supposed to be attending the Assisted Conception Unit. It is as if my life plan had been hijacked. </p> <p>Here is the fairytale, how it is supposed to be: we grow up, we fall in love, we have children. This is still the narrative young people read. It is what my seven-year-old daughter is reading now. Even today, there is no alternative tale. Infertility is not an option any of us imagine for our futures. </p> <p>Yet, once you know that everything doesn't necessarily turn out as predicted, you can never unlearn that knowledge. I have entered a world of agonies, other women's as well as my own, and it is as if my innocence has been lost. When someone tells me they're planning to have a child next year, after they have moved to a bigger flat, I can't feel unfiltered joy. When someone says they're pregnant, my congratulations are feeble. </p> <p>I know life doesn't always turn out as you may want it to. One of the most painful paragraphs I have ever read was in the classified small ads section at the back of Issue, the magazine of the National Fertility Association. \"Issue was extremely saddened to hear that baby Emily Isabel Jones died suddenly and unexpectedly earlier this year, from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Our profoundest sympathies go to her parents, Heather Roberts and Neil Jones. Emily Isabel Jones: born November 18 1999, died January 1 2000\". The parents must have thought the plan was back on track. </p> <p>I expect everything to turn out fine; it usually does. But I do not regard a positive test as the end of the road. Pregnancy is a long and winding road. </p> <p>I am, just, beginning to view happenstance as an essential part of being human. Even though we would not wish agonies on ourselves or others, a regimented, predictable, utterly expected 77 untroubled years in this world would hardly be worth living. The vagaries of pregnancy and childbirth, above all, teaches us that. We cannot control it; we will never be able to. That's life.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:leahwild@cswebmail.com\">leahwild@cswebmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Things move quickly these days - but until I had a baby earlier this year I hadn't realised just how quickly. With two children aged 14 and 12, everyone assumed I'd simply be repeating my previous performance. Instead, I find myself feeling like I have become my own tut-tutting mother: \"We didn't do it that way in my day.\" </p> <p>Getting pregnant, being pregnant, having a baby, looking after a baby, and generally acting the parental part: sometimes subtly, sometimes quite fundamentally, there are times I feel that it's all changed. For the better? Not necessarily. </p> <p>Some changes are well-publicised: the rise in assisted conception; the advances in genetic screening; the extension of immunisation programmes against childhood diseases - and the fears of what additional problems the vaccines might bring; the latest findings in cot death research; and what Madonna thinks of British maternity hospitals. </p> <p>The fact that child-bearing and raising make front page news is in itself different from when I started out. Then, having children was a much more low-key, less self-conscious affair. </p> <p>I had my first two children in the 80s - the so-called style decade. That was me in the John Galliano jacket, with the Conran shop armchairs and the Dualit toaster. But my babies were not privy to such excesses. </p> <p>When I was expecting my first child I headed straight for the second-hand children's gear shops of west London where I was delighted to find a rather worn brown corduroy carrycot. It was wonderfully multifunctional: it sat on wonky wheels (as a pram), on a wooden stand (as a cot) and strapped in the back seat of the car (as a car seat). And it only set me back \u00a310. Why would I spend more on something that would be needed for such a short time? </p> <p>Since then the baby gear industry has gone into overdrive. The choice is vast and ever-changing. Just to take a newborn for a walk you are faced with a plethora of options: two-in-one or three-in-one \"travel systems\", front-facing or rear-facing, traditional pram, all-terrain pushchair. And you are still probably going to want a removable car seat, a Baby Bjorn carrier, and maybe a sling as well. And you'll probably stop using most of that within the first year - a period, according to Prima magazine, when the average parents spend \u00a34,500 on their baby. </p> <p>Everything costs a packet - a Land Rover all-terrain buggy for example is around \u00a3385 - and comes in a bewildering choice of \"designer\" patterns and colourways, as you might expect if you were purchasing a top-of-the-range BMW. As for second-hand, whether it's because of the scare over a connection between \"used\" mattresses and cot death, or simply that parents are gaining status from the fashionableness of their baby equipment, it does not seem nearly so common. </p> <p>That doesn't mean I'm not happy to join in this time around. As a baby-proud new mother, I was delighted to discover Tim Waterstone's newest enterprise, Daisy and Tom, an easy-pram-access shop on King's Road in Chelsea selling great clothes, good books, educational toys, an edited selection of prams and strollers, and even a kiddie haircutting business. In my day, Mothercare was almost top of the range. </p> <p>But the huge increase in things to buy - from sterilising units to magazines to the glories of Baby Gap - is only part of the change. There is a different mindset now. From the very point of conception, parents of the 21st century expect to be in control more than I ever did. A large number of women know the gender of the baby they are carrying. They write plans for the kind of birth they want and follow books that outline the rate at which their child should be developing. Yes, there were childcare manuals in 1986, but not many, and you felt rather foolish resorting to them. Now it is a market worth around \u00a36m a year in this country. </p> <p>The starkest current example of the quest for control is the runaway success of The Contented Little Baby Book by Gina Ford, a maternity nurse. If you follow its schedules - which start off with an hour-by-hour regime for a two-week-old baby - you will be able to set your watch by your newborn, and sleep through the night by at least four months. I suspect its popularity may be partially a result of modern parents witnessing the ghastliness of kids born to their libertarian predecessors, but it is spookily like the four-hourly feeds and leave 'em to cry disciplinarian tactics that my mother remembers guiltily from the 50s. </p> <p>Information is key for the contemporary parent. Everything has a name and every problem has a solution; they daren't sit back or wait and see. Having absorbed the antenatal classes, books, TV programmes, magazines and newspapers, first-time mothers reach the labour ward knowing almost as much as their consultants about the most arcane bits of obstetrics. </p> <p>The perfectly normal struggle to get a baby to sleep at night is now called \"sleep training\" for which there are a number of regimes to try. A London housewife called Annabel Karmel has become a baby food guru by writing books about what is basically mashing up fruit and vegetables. There's very little sense of doing what comes naturally - of having any kind of instinctive feeling for what might suit your particular child. </p> <p>The plethora of research into child development has thrown up fascinating stuff - I never knew small babies were drawn to black and white images for example - but has also created new terrors that are treated with deadly seriousness. When, for example, a new mattress was delivered this week, the cot death warning boldly stated: \"Do not let your baby get too hot (or too cold).\" </p> <p>Back in the 80s I blithely placed my babies on their tummies to sleep; routinely fed them delicious sloppy scrambled egg, and peanut butter sandwiches. While pregnant I drank coffee, wine, gin, whatever, and ate liver, unpasteurized cheese and seafood. I gave up breast feeding after a couple of months. I had never even heard of separation anxiety - and my older children seem fairly normal. Nowadays all of that is verboten , mostly because some report or other has shown them to be \"bad for baby\". </p> <p> But, for all that feeling of proscription and orthodoxy, I have welcomed some changes in modern motherhood with open arms. Seeing celebs like Catherine Zeta-Jones, Madonna and Patsy Kensit with pregnant bellies stylishly bedecked did make me feel less drab when pregnant. Women are no longer routinely weighed at their antenatal class appointments. Antenatal yoga classes are a wonderful invention. Epidurals are readily available and much more acceptable among all types of women, even the staunch NCT-types. From the hospital to the local health centre, there is much more information and help on offer (even if half of it freaks you out). Fathers are generally more involved, and welcomed. </p> <p>There is also one area in which progress has really changed the life of a new mother, and that is nappy technology. I am not talking about the change from cotton nappies to disposable - that did happen between my mother's childbearing years and my own - but the change from barely adequate disposable to miraculously absorbent, totally reliable disposal. And the best thing of all: some frighteningly efficient gel hidden within the depths of these lightweight new inventions means that there is simply no nappy rash anymore. Praise be to God and chuck out the Sudocreme.</p>",
  "Leading Communist party officials went on trial today accused of smuggling and taking bribes in China's biggest corruption case in 51 years of communist rule. <p>Court officials said hearings began in five cities in the south-eastern province of Fujian. But they were unable to supply more information, as most court staff were banned from the courtrooms, while judges and prosecutors kept tight control on the proceedings. </p> <p>The secrecy illustrates the potental damage the scandal could cause to China's leaders. President Jiang Zemin, who heads the 61m-member Communist party, has declared clean government a goal of his rule.</p> <p>Among the unspecified number of defendants were the general manager of the Fujian-based Orient Group, Cao Xinghai, who went on trial in Putian. Court officials refused to specify the charges against Mr Cao.</p> <p>The Fujian scandal has tainted members of the elite ruling circle, among them one of Mr Jiang's proteges. The government has used occasional prosecutions of high-level officials to show the party's determination to end rampant corruption that has eroded support for communist rule. </p> <p>State-run newspapers today reported that the deputy head of transport for Sichuan province had received a death sentence for taking bribes and amassing wealth beyond his means. The court sentenced Zheng Daofang's wife and son to 15 and 12 years in prison and seized property worth \u00a3140,000. </p> <p>By contrast, no mention was made of the Fujian trials.

  "<p>It is widely accepted that the welfare settlement after the second world war was based on the assumption that there would be stable families and full-time work for men. Given the increased insecurity and flexibility of the labour market, the growth in women's employment and the rapid pace of family change in the late 20th century - divorce up threefold and the proportion of children born outside marriage up fourfold in one generation - it is no wonder that the principles underpinning the welfare state are in question. </p> <p>The old welfare model assumed that men would be breadwinners and women would take responsibility for the care of young and old in the family. While the model never wholly accorded with reality, it acted as a powerful prescriptive model reflected in public and private law. </p> <p>At the beginning of the 21st century, government's assumptions have changed dramatically. The drive of \"welfare-to-work\", begun by the Conservatives and developed by Labour, assumes an \"adult worker model family\". All adults who are capable will be in the labour market. But how far does the model fit social reality? And what about unpaid care work? </p> <p>The old male breadwinner model has certainly eroded. According to the general household survey, 81% of men and 62% of women aged 16-64 were economically active in 1975. By 1996, this figure was 70% for both sexes. Married women are just as likely to be employed as non-married women. In contrast, men's labour market participation has fallen; indeed the contribution by men to family income fell more than 10 percentage points between 1979-81 and 1989-91. </p> <p>However, the vast majority of the post-1945 increase in married women's employment is accounted for by part-time employment in the service of the welfare state (much of it low paid); 44% of women workers were part-time in 1998 and almost a quarter work \"short part-time\" - under 20 hours a week. So while families supported by a single male breadwinner are now undoubtedly in a minority, the division of paid work in dual earner households takes a variety of forms. Dual career couples are in fact relatively rare. The norm in Britain, as in many European countries, has become the more or less one-and-a-half-earner household. </p> <p>Government has been stressing the obligation to engage in paid work. But there is also an obligation to care and these two things must be balanced. The Labour government has not neglected the issue of care work. The national child care strategy is a first for a country that has consistently occupied a place near the bottom of the European child care league. The child care tax credit embodied in the working families tax credit scheme is also an important initiative in a country where the issue of reconciling work and family responsibilities has been historically ignored. Further, there is the new strategy for carers and proposals for second pension credits for those caring for young children or adults. </p> <p>However, all these positive initiatives are relatively small alongside the major programmes to get people into employment: the New Deal and the working families tax credit. There is no coherent policy on the care of dependants, young and old, to match the policy on paid work. </p> <p>The problems of moving towards a full adult worker model are fourfold. Unpaid care work is unequally shared between men and women, which has substantial implications for women's position in the labour market. Given the lack of good quality affordable care in the formal sector (public and private), many women have little option but to continue to provide it. A significant number of female carers want to feel that it is \"right\" to prioritise care over paid work. Women's low pay, especially in care-related jobs, means that full individualisation is hard to achieve, on the basis of long part-time or even full-time work. </p> <p>Just as policy assumptions based on a male breadwinner model disadvantaged women in particular, so assumptions based on an adult worker model are likely to do so. This does not mean that policy should swing back to a more traditional family model. Given the likelihood that all adults will have to rely more on self-provision in future, not least in respect of pensions, it is important that as many adults as possible are able to earn. However, it is important that government pays attention to the context for the promotion of a new adult worker model. Without access to affordable, good quality support for care, women in particular may resist the injunction to enter the labour market on more than a short part-time basis. Or they will enter and risk adverse effects on dependants. </p> <p>There are two examples of a long-standing adult worker model. In the US, the obligation to enter the labour market is embedded in a residual welfare system that often borders on the punitive. The US has extremely high rates of child poverty and high rates of juvenile imprisonment. Sweden and Denmark also operate an adult worker model, supported by an extensive range of care entitlements in respect of children and older people. Child poverty rates are the lowest in OECD countries and juvenile crime rates low. </p> <p> These contrasting experiences show there are policy choices. Taking care work seriously should be a priority and we need to share unpaid work between men and women more fairly. Policies that would promote the sharing of care include: paid parental leave, with a portion set aside for use by men (the so-called \"daddy month\" in the Scandinavian countries; a right to a shorter working day (as in Scandinavia) or a shorter working week (as in the Netherlands) for parents with small children; and greater provision of good quality child care and elder care. </p> <p>On the care side, jobs need to attract a living wage and certainly pay no less than working the checkout at Tesco; and the social security system needs to take account of people's lifetime labour market experience, particularly in respect of pension guarantees, so that carers do not suffer further consequences of low-paid work and periods with no pay. </p> <p>It is difficult to work full time and care for dependants. Something has to give. Policy-makers are concerned about the family and about parenting. They are concerned about work. It is strange that they are so little preoccupied with policies on care.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Lewis is Barnett professor of social policy at Oxford University.

  "<p>When Joyce Headley came to Birmingham from Jamaica with her parents and sisters in the early 60s, she dreamed of the snow and of becoming a nurse. She never imagined she'd end up in prison. </p> <p>But here she is working in one of Britain's most troubled prisons, the notorious HMP Brixton in south London, which has witnessed nine suicides and gone through three governors in the last four years. </p> <p>Headley's job, part of a scheme set up by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders four years ago, is to help inmates find an alternative means to a life of crime after their release - the key ingredients to which are employment and housing. </p> <p>She became interested in community work via a playscheme for disadvantaged children where she worked as a volunteer in her 20s. \"I lived in a very deprived part of north London, in Stoke Newington, and so I saw what happened to people who had nothing - they turned to wrong-doing,\" says Brixton's lone rehabilitator. (Her planned nursing career ended after three years, and she confesses: \"I couldn't bear being around sickness and laying people out. It was an environment where I had no control or influence.\") </p> <p>After becoming a teacher's helper, Headley went to teacher training college (deferred after she decided her children needed her at home more) and then joined another ex-offender charity before landing a post in a \"jobclub\" at Pentonville prison, north London. </p> <p>Now aged \"50-ish\", she spends five days a week in Brixton, talking to men about their futures. \"I can help because I'm not judgmental,\" says Headley, whose own family struggled to make ends meet on arrival in Britain. \"You can't just write people off as bad because they've broken the law, especially if you are in a position to make a difference. Anyway, it's in everyone's interest to try to reduce repeat offending. I always tell the employers I invite into Brixton for seminars: 'It could be your mum or a member of your family who is burgled or attacked next.' Everyone deserves a chance at a job.\" </p> <p>Around 40 to 50 inmates visit Headley each week. \"I emphasise to the men they must always try to be rational and positive, and not behave like a victim,\" says Headley. This comes from her own experience bringing up a family in a white-dominated society. When she found her children bleaching their faces to be whiter, she told them they could be whatever they wanted to be if they wanted it enough. Still, she knows it's hard for inmates to retain a positive attitude to life on the outside when there is so much discrimination against them. Without a job to go to, she knows some 65% are likely to re-offend. </p> <p>Ken Hawley, a governor at Brixton with responsibility for inmate activities, says of Headley's work: \"It's about making the prison accessible to those who can help and advise inmates. Joyce is a great organiser, persuasive, and approachable. That, combined with her in-depth knowledge and understanding of inmates' problems, means she is really superb for this role.\" </p> <p>Most of the inmates Headley sees are from disadvantaged backgrounds - many with inevitable literacy and drug problems. \"They're at the bottom of the pile, with no way out,\" she says. \"And with no job, they revert to underhand dealings. </p> <p>\"I want to break down the barrier of employer prejudice, which is largely fear. By getting employers such as Iceland and Kwik-Fit into the custodial setting, I try to break down the myths about ex-offenders. When they see a prisoner in an education class, they often see someone who really is trying to do the best with what they've got instead of someone who is just bad.\" </p> <p>Headley has found jobs locally for several inmates with Iceland, which has pledged to expand the practice to employing ex-offenders nationally, and Kwik-Fit has also expressed interest. She says: \"There's nothing more satisfying than bumping into an inmate on the outside, which I often do, and finding they are working, or have set up a small business.\" </p> <p>She helps inmates to find accommodation, sorts out welfare benefits and gets those in financial difficulty on to debt management pro grammes. She listens to their emotional and domestic problems, and is the only civilian ever to win the prison's \"employee of the month\" award of its 500 staff, 200 of whom are officers. </p> <p>One inmate who acts informally as a \"buddy\" to other prisoners says: \"Men can have a confrontational attitude to other men, whereas they are kinder and gentler to a woman. Joyce is gold. Having her comforting presence and care is so important in a hostile environment like this, it's like water in a desert.\" </p> <p>\"When I walk around, there's such a high black population here I think: 'God, why are you all here? Wouldn't you rather be somewhere else?' None of them did it, of course - they were all fitted up - but quite a few of them do want to change their lives, and with the right help and support they could actually do it. Sadly, there isn't usually a budget for this work in prisons.\" </p> <p>The government has just announced funding for careers and housing advice for seven prisons, including Pentonville, to be run along similar lines to Brixton's Nacro project. </p> <p>Jobs can't get much tougher than persuading employers to take on men who've been in prison. Headley attributes her success to her parents, but not in a totally positive way. She says: \"They were terribly Victorian and strict, but they were in a strange country and were unquestioning of those in authority, such as doctors and teachers, in a way that only immigrants are. I was determined not to be the same. I don't have tunnel vision. I'm more challenging and exploratory, and I'm grateful to them for that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Christine Barton can't write. She has a PhD, is an equal opportunities consultant, a trustee of various charities, and received an MBE in the recent birthday honours list, but she can't write. </p> <p>Christine is my partner. It's not that she doesn't know how to write. She knows how to write rather well; words are part of what she does. But she has multiple sclerosis and there are a lot of physical things she can't do. Not being able to hold a pen might seem trivial in comparison with not being able to stand, walk or feed yourself, but the consequences are far-reaching. </p> <p>Strictly, it's not writing that's the problem; with a personal computer and the latest voice recognition software, Christine can put words on screen almost as fast as she can think. The problem - and it's a big one - centres on that untidy, personal and often illegible squiggle which we all take for granted: our signature. Without the means to identify ourselves, we don't exist. And Christine can't sign her name. </p> <p>Because multiple sclerosis is a progressive condition, what begins as a minor inconvenience can rapidly become a major problem. As writing became more difficult, I started signing her cheques. Holding a pen at the very top produced a good approximation of her shaky signature, and no one ever queried it. Yes, I know it's illegal, but it's the best we could think of at the time. </p> <p>At first, I think we both accepted that further limitation of Christine's independence was inevitable. By now, she couldn't sign cheques, use her credit or Switch card, sign a passport or an insurance application, and I didn't even want to think about what might happen if we ever wanted to sell the house. </p> <p>Early solutions tended to accept the limitations. Christine arranged for a credit card to be issued in the name of her personal assistant. This solved the immediate problem of shopping, but wasn't a lot of use when she was out with friends or her daughter. A joint bank account was suggested, but Christine has always steadfastly resisted this - something to do with my belief that, if God had wanted us to keep our accounts in credit, he wouldn't have created overdrafts. However, I did become an authorised signatory on her account. </p> <p>People made helpful suggestions. Could Christine hold a pen in her mouth? Could a pen be put between her fingers and someone else move her hand? </p> <p>All were well intentioned, but the reality was that Christine's capacity to make her own decisions, to control her own life, was being progressively eroded. She was being penalised for not being able to write her name. But who is at fault - Christine, or a system which insists that she must? </p> <p>Attempting to open a new building society account was the catalyst: \"Certainly, madam, but we need a signature - someone will need to take power of attorney.\" </p> <p>Power of attorney involves handing over responsibility to someone else. Christine was not prepared to allow this. It would reduce her independence still further and reinforces the tacit link in the public mind between physical impairment and mental incapacity. It's the \"does she take sugar?\" syndrome, and it's unacceptable. Physical impairment need not and should not equal dependency. But it frequently does and that's why the system needs challenging. Christine started with the building society. It took a number of phone calls and some intensive consultation between the local branch and head office, but she now has her Nationwide Isa. The forms were filled in by the branch manager without signature and she can withdraw money from the local branch at any time, again without signature. The Inland Revenue was quite sniffy about the arrangement, claiming that there had to be a signature for the account to qualify for tax exemption, but Nationwide managed to overcome these objections. </p> <p>Next, the bank. Christine had been in protracted negotiations with Barclays because, being unable to sign, she could not use either her Barclaycard or Switch card in shops. Initially, they were unable to come up with any solution, so it was time to try a different tack. </p> <p>Christine is a trustee of Voluntary Action Sheffield. Its legal adviser suggested she try a number of routes, one of which eventually led to the British Bankers' Association in London - and this turned out to be the key. Joanna Elson, a director of the association, wrote to Christine enclosing a leaflet advising banks and customers what can be done when customers find it difficult to sign. This leaflet contained the crucial statement: \"English law recognises as a valid signature not only one written manually by the signatory, but also one appropriately embossed using a facsimile signature stamp.\" </p> <p>Christine now has a facsimile stamp. This was easily obtained by taking a copy of an old signature to a legal stationer who produced the stamp. Barclays supplied new Switch and Barclaycards which were embossed with the stamp (slight prob lem: on the cards, the ink from the stamp took three days to dry). A copy of the signature has also been scanned into her computer so that she can use this on letters. </p> <p>Now, when Christine goes shopping, she pays. Whoever accompanies her will use the stamp on her behalf, but she is in control. No retailer has ever questioned this method of payment. In fact, the reaction of most has been: \"What a good idea!\" </p> <p>There has been one challenge, almost inevitably from the legal profession. Christine was until recently a trustee of Age Concern Sheffield and, in this capacity, agreed to sign a lease for office accommodation. The solicitors handling the transaction initially refused to accept the facsimile, suggesting that the advice from the British Bankers' Association counted only as custom and practice and was not in fact law. Back to the association and Elson was able to supply the necessary references and precedents. Lease stamped! </p> <p>Christine is angered and frustrated by the barriers which society creates. \"You stop being a real person with the same rights as everyone else,\" she says. \"The more impaired you become the less rights you seem to have and this is not how it should be.\" </p> <p>But there's always another battle. Christine's passport needs renewing. The Passport Agency will accept a facsimile stamp on passport applications, but only with a covering statement from the applicant's GP. Do the rest of us need a statement from our GPs? No? Oh dear, here we go again.</p> <p><strong>Right impression </strong></p> <p>Nobody knows how many people cannot sign their name, or have problems doing so, but it is likely to number many thousands. As well as people with degenerative illnesses, there are those with severe physical and learning disabilities who may never have had a signature. </p> <p>The British Bankers' Association leaflet, which prompted Christine Barton to find a solution in the form of her own \"rubber stamp\" (pictured left), says some banks will provide templates to help position a signature on a cheque book or credit card, or will issue cards with a photograph of the user.</p> <p>The leaflet, available from the association on 020-7216 8800 or at www.bba.org.uk, offers tips for people who have difficulty producing a consistent signature: a weighted cuff may help curb a tremor; a thick or felt pen makes writing easier. An occupational therapist may advise further.</p> <p>\u0095 The British Bankers' Association can be contacted at Pinners Hall, 105-108 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1EX</p>",
  "<p>Councils in England and Wales this week enter the brave new world of rigorous monitoring with publication of the first reports from the new local government inspectorate. They face the ultimate sanction of Whitehall intervention if performance in particular sectors - from refuse collection to housing management and libraries - is considered consistently below par. But fears that under-performing authorities face Ofsted-style \"naming and shaming\" have been allayed by the woman who will lead the new regime. </p> <p>Unlike the abrasive Chris Woodhead, who leads Ofsted, Wendy Thomson is a friend - albeit a critical one - of town and county hall. \"Some authorities are excellent, doing an excellent job,\" says the head of the new inspectorate in the audit commission, whose 300-strong army has begun fanning out across England and Wales. \"Others are complacent, keeping their head down. Then there are a few bad ones that everybody hears about.\" </p> <p>Thomson, credited with turning around the east London borough of Newham during her three years as its chief executive, this week produced her first seven reports on council services, ranging from housing management in Sutton, south London, to waste management in Dudley and building control in Sefton on Merseyside. </p> <p>Not the most earth-shattering services, she agrees - but vitally important to people in local communities. \"Local government may not always be sexy, but it spends \u00a370bn annually of public money . . . so there is an important question to be asked about how you get the best value without jeopardising local democracy and the need for local areas to have their own way of doing things.\" </p> <p>In the end, the seven councils acquitted themselves well with \"two star\" ratings in a four-tier system, ranging from three stars for excel lence to one (could do better) and none (bad). </p> <p>Thomson, a Canadian who came to Britain 18 years ago for a PhD in social administration, is young enough to have wider ambition - as a future head, perhaps, of a super-inspectorate embracing Ofsted and the Department of Health's social services inspectorate (SSI)? The two services, after all, account for the bulk of council spending. Naturally, as a good diplomat, that's something she declines to discuss, although her inspectorate has to work closely with both Ofsted and the SSI. </p> <p>But as someone with experience of Ofsted during her time at Newham (\"I know how focusing it can become - we were one of the ones that came off well,\" she laughs dryly) the chief inspector is clearly determined to offer more of a carrot than a stick. Her inspectors, while mainly \"the best [local government] service managers we can find\" also come from the private sector. Significantly, she is also recruiting from charities - \"because we want that community perspective\". </p> <p>She says: \"I know if you want to change organisations you've got to have some pretty strong ambition and vision to do that and you've got to both support people and also challenge the existing ways and try to get that balance.\" It's about \"how to work with people to drive up improvement\". </p> <p>That should please the Local Government Association which - with a critical eye on Ofsted - warned last week that inspection must deliver long-term improvement \"not just short-term headlines\". </p> <p>As part of the new regime, councils will have to produce a best value performance plan for a particular service every year, while looking at all services in detail every five years. Best value, underpinned by a bewildering array of performance indicators, is all about continuous improvement through community involvement. </p> <p>Thomson, while firmly committed to strong local government, is keen to make it clear she can be tough as well as tender. </p> <p>As a final sanction, she will issue authorities running failing services with a tight time-frame to improve them. And if that fails to work, she can make a recommendation to the government which can order another authority, or service provider, to take over. </p> <p>But for now, that powder is being kept very dry.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The drain strain</strong><br> </p> <p> The brain drain of voluntary sector executives to the civil service (Headhunted, September 6) does indeed reflect Whitehall's acknowledgement of the wealth of talent and experience that resides in the sector. </p> <p>But it does more.It also reflects the impact of the skills and knowledge gaps created by civil service restructuring and \"delayering\" of recent years and by the current constant turnover in membership of departmental teams. </p> <p>Paul Convery rightly points to the need for government to underpin organisations from which it has recruited top talent. What better way to do this than by revisiting the issue of dwindling core funding for the voluntary sector? Its gradual disappearance is responsible for a quiet crisis which may soon render the sector unable to nurture the talent from which the government now benefits. Civil society will be all the poorer for it. <br> <strong> Eva Lloyd</strong> <br>Chief executive<br> National Early Years Network </p> <p><strong> Funding fiasco</strong></p> <p> Timothy Hornsby says that the National Lottery Charities Board (NLCB) does not have the money to \"fund forever the ongoing costs of organisations\" (letters, August 30). Of course it does, if it chooses to use its funds in that way. Instead, it chooses to fund mostly for very limited periods of time. </p> <p>It would be really interesting to know what possible good will come of allowing projects to start, or to expand, and then taking the funds away three years later, especially when the funds being applied by the NLCB are so large that there is no hope of the projects being picked up by other funders. Not only is it difficult to see what good is being done, for many of us in the sector these stop/go policies appear to be positively harmful. </p> <p>I would like to see an organisation like the NLCB looking at its policies in terms of their actual effect on the beneficiaries, and on the structure of the voluntary sector, rather than sticking with the nonsensical idea that the most useful way to spend money is to spread it around liberally. </p> <p>It might also be useful if the NLCB looked at the government code of good practice on funding. </p> <p> <strong> Carole Howells</strong> <br>Director<br> Newcastle Council for Voluntary Service </p> <p><strong> Housing realities</strong></p> <p> It would be a great shame if the debate over the future ownership of Glasgow council housing (Out of stock, September 6) were to rest on the assumption that only housing associations can borrow against rental income. </p> <p>It is quite clear that with minimal changes to central government accounting rules - within EU and international criteria - Glasgow council could, by means of a local housing corporation (not company), borrow in the same way as any housing association and therefore retain control. </p> <p>There may be democratic arguments for transfer of housing stock, but these need to be differentiated from false economic ones. <br><strong>Martin Earl</strong><br> London</p> <p>There is no question that the battle over whether council housing in Glasgow should, in effect, be privatised is one which will have an impact throughout Britain. Soothing talk of mutuality and social ownership, together with the poor state of much council housing, have been used to push through privatisations in other areas. </p> <p>Before Labour councillors anywhere go down the road of privatisation, however, they need to ask themselves: if councils cannot provide cheap, well-run and maintained housing for those who can't afford to buy their own homes, then what exactly are they and local councils for? </p> <p><strong> Keith Flett</strong><br> Haringey Against Privatisation<br> London </p> <p><strong> Give and take</strong> </p> <p> Diana Grimes (letters, September 6) is wrong to punish cancer researchers just because their fundraisers have to be paid. </p> <p>Fundraisers do a dirty job but bring millions to the coffers of their employing charities. Without them, the charity would die - if for no other reason than someone else's fund-raiser would soon seduce its donors into switching loyalties. </p> <p>If \u00a370,000 is what is needed to buy a top-grade head of fundraising, then it is money well spent. </p> <p>This is the same reasoning that keeps capitalists paying their running-dog/fat-cat directors huge salaries. And it reflects the fact that \"charity\" is an industry almost like the manufacture of, say, automotive parts. The difference is that parts' quality can be measured objectively whereas that of charity has to be taken largely on trust. </p> <p>My advice to Ms Grimes is to keep giving. She might consider not sending her donations in the form of responses to mailshots, as such donations may be \"skimmed\" of fundraising commissions before reaching the target charity. (This is not the case with Oxfam and charities of similar good standing.) </p> <p> <strong> Lionel Shapiro<br></strong> London </p> <p><strong> A land not fit for heroes</strong></p> <p> I happened to read Bob Holman's moving account of his wartime childhood (A world set on fire, August 23) the same day I visited the Spitfire summer exhibition at the Imperial War Museum. </p> <p>I could not but reflect how badly we have let down some of those heroic \"ordinary\" people Holman describes, who more than rose to the occasion in 1940. </p> <p>Many of them are now frail and alone, receiving indifferent care at best, in nursing homes that are privately run for profit. </p> <p>It is ironic that they almost certainly were offered a better cup of tea in an air-raid shelter than they might be served today. </p> <p> <strong> Sheila Millington</strong> <br> Weybridge <br> Surrey</p> <p>\u0095 Write to Guardian Society, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\">society@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Gianfranco Zola will not become Chelsea manager it was announced this morning, as speculation increases over the identity of Gianluca Vialli's successor. Zola, installed as the bookmaker's favourite for the Stamford Bridge job, was ruled out of the race by the club's managing director Colin Hutchinson.</p> <p>\"Gianfranco Zola will not be promoted to the manager's job,\" Hutchinson said today. \"We are a Continental side playing football in England and this will be reflected in the choice we make. But we do not believe that we will take anybody from the current staff despite what some people have been suggesting.\"</p> <p>Hutchinson's comments seem to confirm the general feeling in this morning's newspapers that the Blues will turn to Serie A for their new coach.

  "<p>Space shuttle Atlantis' crew completed several projects aboard the international space station this morning, snapping new batteries into place and hauling gear into the growing outpost. </p> <p>The focus was on bringing full power to the two Russian segments of the station. </p> <p>Astronaut Edward Lu and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko finished sliding three new batteries into the station's newest addition, the Russian service module Zvezda. </p> <p>Three of Zvezda's eight batteries were kept back on Earth to conserve weight aboard the hefty spacecraft, grounded for more than two years because of Russia's economic problems. Though Zvezda launched in July, it made its debut in orbit when Atlantis' crew cracked open its hatches Tuesday. </p> <p>Down the hall from Zvezda, astronaut Daniel Burbank and cosmonaut Boris Morukov replaced one of six batteries aboard the Russian-built control module Zarya. They were to replace another one Wednesday night, to complete an upgrade of the craft's battery system. </p> <p>In May, astronauts had to replace four of Zarya's batteries, which were damaged via careless overcharging by Russian flight controllers. The two up for replacement this time were near the end of their operational lifetimes, and may also have been improperly charged. </p> <p>All of the batteries in both modules will have to be brought online, one by one, under the watch of Russian flight controllers. That usually takes about a day after installation, Nasa said. </p> <p>The battery work wasn't without its difficulties. Four small nutplates, riveted to Zarya's floor, obstructed a pair of bolts that Burbank and Morukov needed to loosen to replace a voltage converter that goes with the new battery. Mission Control quickly consulted with engineers in Houston and Russia for a solution. Their high-tech answer? Knock the nutplates free with a hammer and chisel. </p> <p>Mission Control sent Burbank to retrieve the space station's tool kit, with a motherly reminder to remember his safety goggles. He then chipped the end off the rivets holding the offending nutplates down, enabling him to remove a bracket that blocked part of the battery compartment. </p> <p>Aside from that small challenge, the shuttle and station appeared to be running very well. </p> <p>During their five days inside the station, the crew has to transfer 6,100 pounds of equipment from the shuttle and an unmanned Russian supply ship which docked with Zvezda in August. </p> <p>The gear is for the station's first resident crew, who are due to spend four months on board beginning in November. </p> <p>Atlantis is scheduled to undock from the space station Sunday and finish its 12-day mission with a September 20 return.</p>",
  "<p>It's a typical slice of daily life at the palm-fringed hub of the new economy: a workplace, undoubtedly, but one where an unusual definition of \"work\" holds sway. Engineers are chasing each other down the hallways, firing soft-tipped darts from Nerf guns. Their programmer colleagues are busy playing table football, or hunched over video-games. And when real work begins, it is as likely to take the form of a \"bug bash\" - where programmers stay in the office long into the night until they have fixed a certain number of glitches in the system - as it is a conventional meeting. </p> <p>Or, at least, this is what the male ones are doing. These are scenes from Valley of the Boys, a documentary by Monika Khushf, director of engineering at the software company Intuit, which alarmed many by demonstrating just how male-dominated Silicon Valley's working culture really is. Khushf, interviewing male and female engineers from major technology companies including <a href=\"http://www.sun\" target=\"_NEW\">Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Apple Computers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.netscape.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Netscape</a>, portrayed a workplace where men spend long hours - weekends included - constructing elaborate model cities in Lego while their female colleagues look on, depressed or simply resigned. \"They're having a great old time,\" one woman told Khushf. \"And I'm sitting there going, 'Oh, please!'\" </p> <p>These women would not be surprised by a new list of the most influential people in the valley compiled by the San Jose Mercury, its leading newspaper. Not one woman made the top 10. And in Britain, we're no better - our three biggest internet companies, <a href=\"http://freeserve.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Freeserve</a>, the auction site <a href=\"http://www.qxl.com\" target=\"_NEW\">QXL </a>and the software firm <a href=\"http://www.autonomy.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Autonomy</a>, have one woman director between them. In any sector this would be a cause for concern - but in the supposedly revolutionary crucible of e-business, where casually attired workers pride themselves on abandoning the hang-ups of the old economy, it is little short of a disaster. </p> <p>It's not as if there aren't any women entrepreneurs to begin with: according to the National Foundation of Women Business Owners, the number of women-owned businesses in the US has more than doubled in the past decade. Indeed, American women seem positively fuel-injected when it comes to start-ups: they are launching businesses at twice the rate of their male counterparts. </p> <p>But it is becoming increasingly clear that the old boys' network that has been consigned to history is being replaced by a new one, focused on the venture capitalists who provide the speculative backing for the valley's big ideas. </p> <p>Insiders like to portray the new economy as running on little but caffeine and ideas, but of course, deep down, it runs on cash - and here, a new boys' network is vigorously asserting itself. According to Venture One, an organisation that provides information to venture capitalists, only 5% of the total venture capital funding in the States goes to companies with women chief executives. Of the 3,000 venture capitalists currently working in the US, only 90 are women, says Diana Reid, of the San Francisco-based Forum for Women Entrepreneurs. You do the math, as they say in San Jose. </p> <p>Reid and others are starting to mobilise the valley's women, in a movement that includes Women in Technology International - which holds an annual Silicon Valley summit in Santa Clara - and a range of \"incubators\", such as the San Francisco-based Women's Technology Cluster, which aims specifically to nurture technology start-ups run by women. Not that you will ever get anyone in the politics-free valley to admit to being an activist. \"We don't consider ourselves to be an affirmative-action group,\" says Reid. \"We're just trying to jump-start excellent business plans.\" </p> <p>In Britain, the situation is even worse when it comes to venture- capital funding. Lucy Marcus, who set up <a href=\"http://www.HighTech-Women.com\" target=\"_NEW\">HighTech-Women.com</a> to support women in technology-related fields by mentoring and networking, says there are a pitiful number of women venture capitalists working in London. \"I can name them without running out of fingers,\" she says. </p> <p>Launched in March this year, High Tech-Women already boasts 700 members. Recent months have also witnessed the launch of Busygirl.co.uk, the first business technology portal dedicated to women internet entrepreneurs, and Webgrrls.org.uk, another networking organisation. </p> <p>\"In the UK, getting VC finance is made more difficult because the VCs in town have always been traditional city boys of the old-school network,\" says May Chong of Webgrrls. \"They are men who have very little experience of doing business with women - let alone women who are younger and more 'techy' than them.\" </p> <p>The best-known American exception to all this is Carly Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the first woman to head one of America's 20 largest companies as measured by revenues. Recently named by Fortune magazine as the most powerful woman in business, she sees the gender divide as part of a wider problem of conformity - exactly the personality trait that most valley entrepreneurs expend energy trying to deny. </p> <p>\"Diversity needs to become a priority in the hi-tech industry,\" Fiorina says. \"Right now there is a virtual wall between available talent and available jobs: diversity is not a hiring practice nor a hiring priority in many Silicon Valley companies.\" This, combined with the \"less-than-open perspective of many hiring managers\" means, says Fiorina, that \"this industry has far too much conformity\". </p> <p>Strenuous attempts are being made to change things. The American Computer Experience, for example, offers free places to girls on its computer camps (predictably, computer summer camps are dominated by boys: only 10-15% of campers are girls). Other educational projects seek to educate the educators: surveys show that girls are put off computing by dull programming classes dominated by nerdy boys nursing violent videogames and an inability to communicate in anything other than computer programming languages. </p> <p>Wendy Tan is one of the lucky British women to be shown the money. At 29, she is the founder and chief executive of Moonfruit, a service provider specialising in website-building tools. \"In my career, it's so normal being the only woman that you don't notice it any more,\" she says. Of the 40 businesses in the investment portfolio of their major backer, the investment-fund firm Europ@web, Tan says she is the only female boss. </p> <p>Ultimately, the valley's unstoppable appetite for talent may force change. Says Carolyn Leightton, founder and chair of Women in Technology International: \"As the demand for talented technologists grows, and the supplies continue to shrink, those companies which are committed to removing the barriers for the advancement of women will certainly be the winners.\" Although it may be drowned out by the sound of the table-football games and the Nerf-gun shootouts, a quiet revolution may soon become an economic necessity.</p>",
  "The career of the bibliographer and curator Donald Gallup, who has died age 87, was entirely spent at Yale University, and closely parallels the rise of American literary archives to their present unchallenged supremacy. With sharp-eyed rivals at Harvard, Princeton and the University of Texas at Austin, Gallup was that bit sharper, and better connected. His skills as a courtier were no less fabled than his gifts as a bibliographer. <p>He was for three decades curator of the Yale collection of American literature, during which period he published the standard bibliographies of TS Eliot and Ezra Pound, and edited numerous manuscripts by Gertrude Stein, Thornton Wilder, Pound and Eugene O'Neill held in the Yale library. He curated exhibitions at Yale, addressed learned societies on bibliography, and seemed to have his thumb on virtually every modern literary discovery. </p> <p>The son of a lumber worker in Sterling, Connecticut, Gallup attended Yale during the height of the depression. The Johnsonian scholar Chauncey B Tinker singled out his promise, and, after graduating in 1934, he wrote his doctoral dissertation on Giuseppi Baretti, a friend of Johnson's biographer, James Boswell. </p> <p>The discovery of the Boswell papers at Malahide castle in Scotland, and their purchase by Yale in 1949, strengthened the identification of the university with 18th-century scholarship. After Gertrude Stein's death in 1946, Yale purchased her papers, and Gallup joined the team which published her unpublished writings. It was Stein, not Boswell, who represented the future direction of the Yale literary archive. </p> <p>Gallup was crucial to the emerging reputation of Yale as a force in modern writing, having published a catalogue of Eliot's first editions, which were exhibited at Yale in 1937. That early catalogue formed the basis for a more detailed Eliot checklist in 1947, and for Gallup's full-scale bibliography of Eliot, published in 1952. It was not a commercial success, selling only 150 copies a year before being pulped in 1963. An expanded edition appeared in 1969. </p> <p>When the manuscript of The Waste Land was discovered in the New York Public Library, Gallup was asked by the Times Literary Supplement to write an evaluation of the manuscript. In effect, he introduced the literary discovery of the century to a wider public. </p> <p>Gallop's earliest literary passion was as a collector; while still a graduate student, he spent his spare money purchasing Eliot's early, and, on London trips, began collecting the sketches and paintings of Edward Lear. Back in wartime Britain with the US army, he continued to acquire first editions and rare titles by British writers, and, in 1945, spent a term at Magdalen College, Oxford, studying bibliography with David Nichol Smith. </p> <p>In 1997, Gallup donated his $1m collection of Lear materials, which included seven oils and more than 300 drawings, to Yale's British art centre. Later, he donated a 13-shelf foot collection of the works of Lawrence Durrell. </p> <p>Gallup's enthusiasm for Eliot was soon followed by an interest in Ezra Pound. Both writers had notoriously complicated private lives, and it took all of Gallup's charm and persistence to keep Pound's parents, wife, mistress, son and publishers sweet. He visited the Pound materials looked after by the poet's former mistress, Olga Rudge, at Sant'Ambrogio di Ripallo in 1957, and returned to Italy in 1961 on a Guggenheim fellowship, by which time the Pound papers were under the control of the poet's daughter, Princess Mary de Rachewiltz. Gallup's monumental Pound bibliography of 1963 was built upon materials he had purchased over the preceding two decades. </p> <p>Yale University Library published two volumes of Gallup's reminiscences, Pigeons On The Granite (1988) and What Mad Pursuits (1998). Last spring, Jonathan Edward College, at Yale, staged an exhibition of paintings and drawing by Elie Lascaux from the Gallup collection. As a bibliographer, he was responsive to the needs of scholars, rare-book dealers and collectors. The purpose of a bibliography, he argued in a lecture in 1970, was \"to establish the facts, clear away confusion, and create order.\" </p> <p>He never married. </p> <p>\u0095 Donald Clifford Gallup, bibliographer, editor and curator, born May 12 1913; died September 6 2000</p>",
  "1.

It gave the US box office the old one-two, grossing a perfectly shapely $17.2m (\u00a312.2m) in its first weekend.</p> <p>3. Latin, of course, equals feisty in the ever-so-subtle world of Hollywood and so Jennifer is seen showcasing her typical gutsy style, playing a psychotherapist forced to delve into the mind of serial killer Vincent D'Onofrio. <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0034/taubin.shtml\" target=\"_new\">Not exactly virtuoso stuff</a>. </p> <p>4. Still, it could be worse. Latinos in decades of previous Hollywood films have mostly just been of the unhinged <a href=\"http://www.clinteastwood.net/pix/gallery/large60/goodbad3.jpg\" target=\"_new\">\"Eh! Senor! You want guns?\"</a> variety. Antonio Banderas was invariably <a href=\"http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~hgb/1492/filmimaj.html\" target=\"_new\">typecast</a> in such roles, occasionally broadening his scope to portray Latinos of the over-amorous variety.</p> <p>5. Currently Ms Lopez is the only Latin film star to command heavyweight fees and displays humour and general believability in virtually <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Name?Lopez,+Jennifer\" target=\"_new\">every role</a> she's been in. Blood and Wine, Selena, and Out of Sight - in which she can be seen smooching with the <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/3526/\" target=\"_new\">George Clooney</a> - are stand-out roles.</p> <p>6. Then there's her music career. Her background is as a dancer and singer and, though truthfully she's probably a better actress, her mission to get the globe writhing to tepid Latin-tinged pop has so far been successful. Her debut album <a href=\"http://allmusic.com/cg/x.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A417448\" target=\"_new\">On The 6</a> went double-gold in the UK and sold even better globally. The follow-up is due this autumn.</p> <p>7. Surely it's only a matter of time before movie and music careers converge and we witness the sort of cross-promotional orgy flogged to death by the shameless (but still somehow charming) <a href=\"http://www.willsmith.net/main.html\" target=\"_new\">Will Smith</a>.</p> <p>8. Of course, Sean \"Puffy\" Coombs helped out producing on her debut and began stepping out with Jen shortly afterwards. Their relationship's since become the stuff of celebrity lore, with her inexplicably sticking by him throughout his numerous <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3945529,00.html\" target=\"_new\">fracas</a>, not to mention his gut-wrenching hip-hop karaoke.</p> <p>9. Ms Lopez's bounteous curves, reportedly insured for $1bn (Puff Daddy has since gloated that they're worth at least $5bn), have rather inevitably <a href=\"http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/pics/mask/pics/57.jpg\" target=\"_new\">captured the imagination</a> of the sort of teenage males who populate the internet. Fansites are <a href=\"http://www.bestcelebritysites.com/jennifer-lopez/\" target=\"_new\">legion</a>.</p> <p>10.

  "<p>RTL Group, the ambitious broadcasting giant which controls Channel 5, is to increase its financial firepower by releasing more shares onto the market.</p> <p>RTL was formed this year through the merger of the TV interests of German media giant Bertelsmann, Spain's Audiofina and the UK's Pearson - owner of the Financial Times. </p> <p>Following its July flotation on the London Stock Exchange, the company plans to break into the FTSE 100 index through increasing the amount of shares on the market from 10.3% to 15%.</p> <p>The group today signalled its intent by acquiring an additional 6.23% holding in Spanish television channel Antena 3 for E155.7m (\u00a395.2m).

  "This is Blair's first out-of-our-control crisis. So what is he to do? It is clear what model the prime minister has in mind: Lady Thatcher at her most determined. Determined (like her) to expose the pusillanimous weakness of the French government in rapidly conceding \u00a3300m worth of tax breaks to militant truckers. <p>Mr Blair asserted - in a made-for-TV soundbite on Monday - \"We cannot and we will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets. That is not the way to make policy in Britain and, as far as I am concerned, it never will be.\" </p> <p>Fighting talk and Gordon Brown echoed it yesterday in his speech to the TUC in Glasgow, albeit with a few crafty caveats which may yet provide ministers with a necessary loophole. It is all very well to sound \"Churchillian\" as Michael Portillo mockingly put it (and he should know), but only if you can make it stick and do so at modest political cost. </p> <p>Clearly caught off-guard, Mr Blair's remarks were a gut response to a campaign he instinctively dislikes. They were made without consulting his pollsters or his focus groups and - surprise, surprise - they rapidly turned out to be as out of touch with the mood of the moment as his WI speech in Wembley. </p> <p>What he sounded like was less Margaret \"Lady's Not for Turning\" Thatcher than John Major in mid-1992 telling anyone who would listen that a devaluation of sterling inside the EU's exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was a \"fool's gold\" option which simply would not happen. The markets thought otherwise and, backed by public opinion, may do so this time. Lady Thatcher, a more pragmatic politician than it ever suited her to admit, would not have been so rash, though she might have let a colleague play mini-Churchill and carry the can for subsequent failure. </p> <p>In 2000 it will be hard for Mr Blair to walk away from a climbdown. There are no quick fixes here. By invoking emergency powers the cabinet hopes to force the colluding petrol companies to try harder to get their fuel out and force the police to treat the truckers as if they were striking miners. </p> <p>It may even work, in which case fickle public opinion - and the Mail - will applaud. But if it does not then the government's duty is to talk, even it that means \"discussions, not negotiations\", a distinction the hapless French transport minister tried to make last week. It may not mean immediate concessions, but a nod from Mr Brown that he has got the message - and will do something in his pre-election budget. Even Mr Jospin's package will be spun out over two years. </p> <p>After all, this is a government which prides itself on listening to middle England and appeasing its newspapers. It is a government which does not want to alienate motorists, of whom there are a lot. Many need their cars and will still need them when John Prescott has miraculously transformed public transport. </p> <p>There is no shame in admitting that factors outside its control (rising world petrol prices) have combined with some within its control (green taxes and budget balancing) to threaten real hardship to important producer groups and - politically more important - consumers on wheels. </p> <p>So far the Blairites have usually managed to pick on easy targets for their tough stances. But Downing Street would do well to remember the fox hunting controversy, where a seemingly easy target turned into the formidable Countryside Alliance. The government backed off then. It may have to again. At last night's No 10 press conference Mr Blair already sounded more emollient. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:michael.white@theguardian.com\">michael.white@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The police launched a nationwide strategic response to the fuel crisis yesterday as the home secretary Jack Straw and Sir John Evans, head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, held emergency talks over possible ways of ending the protests. <p>The Acpo-run national information centre, which collects intelligence from all forces in England and Wales so that officers can be deployed effectively, was reopened at Scotland Yard for the first time since Millennium eve. </p> <p>Mr Straw and Sir John also convened the civil contingencies committee in the cabinet offices to discuss ways of breaking the deadlock. </p> <p>Although yesterday's meetings were amicable, Sir John reminded the Home Secretary that chief constables are \"operationally independent\" and will not bow to pressure to use force against demonstrators. </p> <p>Before yesterday the police had done very little to stop protesters setting up camp outside refineries and depots, preferring to \"manage\" the demonstrations as best they could once they were in place. </p> <p>Many senior officers believe the government has drifted unwittingly into a full scale crisis and cannot look to the police to sort it out. Scarred by the experiences of the miners' strike when they were accused of being Margaret Thatcher's stormtroopers, forces re very reluctant to be drawn into protracted conflict again. </p> <p>\"Policing by consent is what it is all about in Britain,\" said Kevin Morris, president-elect of the Police Superintendents Association and a veteran of policing protests against live animal exports in Shoreham. \"It would be appalling to go back to the way things were during the miners' strike. We don't want to get involved with that again.\" </p> <p>Circumstances are different now. Before the miners' strike, the Conservatives introduced specific powers through the Employment Act of 1980 and 1982 to restrict picketing and secondary picketing. </p> <p>\"The government introduced laws to deliberately take on the miners in an industrial dispute and even then it took nine months to defeat them,\" Mr Morris added. \"This is not an industrial dispute in the same way. It is a dispute involving an industry but there are different parties involved so those powers cannot be used.\" </p> <p>The police can turn to the 1980 Road Traffic Act and the 1986 Public Order Act. They give officers the right to intervene when protesters are obstructing the highway or if they are turning violent. There are also common law powers relating to unlawful assembly and breaches of peace. </p> <p>So far, there has been little appetite to use them. Other factors have also steered the police towards a policy of non-intervention. People are allowed to protest lawfully and human rights legislation demands that the police response be \"proportional\". </p> <p>Many of the demonstrators have allowed emergency supplies to leave the refineries after talks with the police, so is it \"proportional\" to break up a peaceful protest forcibly, probably with an inevitable escalation to violence? </p> <p>There are practical problems too. Very few police officers have heavy goods vehicle licences. If hauliers are arrested, the police will not be able to drive their lorries away. Officers would rather take the details of protesters and deal with them later rather than be confrontational. </p> <p>\"The government and the police have to respect the fact that these protests seem to have widespread public support,\" Mr Morris said. </p> <p>Privately, senior officers say they would prefer the government to sanction army intervention rather than applying pressure on them to act. </p> <p>Although the police have made it clear this is not a mess of their making, the forces were undoubtedly caught on the hop by the escalation of the dispute. </p> <p>There was very little, if any intelligence on the likelihood of demonstrations, which has forced the police to adopt a defensive position. </p> <p>The national information centre, at Scotland Yard, is used to coordinate police resourcing of critical situations, such as Millennium eve, and is linked to the Metropolitan police's \"golf tango\" special operations unit, which oversees London's uniformed response to emergency situations. </p> <p>\"There is no frustration between the police and Mr Straw,\" said a Home Office spokesman. \"He respects the position the police are in. A strategy is being formulated but it is being kept under wraps unless and until it is needed.\"</p>",
  "<b> Public transport</b> <br> <p>Leaving the car at home and using public transport looked futile last night as bus companies stopped night services, diesel trains were cancelled, London Underground drivers struggled to get to work and taxis in the north began to charge double rates. </p> <p>Stagecoach spokesman Barry Gardner said 75% of buses nationwide had enough fuel to run normal services until Friday. After that, less popular routes outside 8am to 6pm would have to be cancelled. </p> <p>The worst hit were buses in the north-west and Wales. The Stagecoach bus depot in Chadderton, greater Manchester, yesterday ran out of fuel as did three other bus depots in Bolton, Wigan, and Glossop, Derbyshire. Bullocks bus company suspended all services in Cheshire and south Manchester between 10am and 3pm, while callers to BBC Greater Manchester Radio complained that taxis in the area were charging double rates. </p> <p>In Gwent, Wales, around 50% of Stagecoach buses were cancelled and 30% of services stopped in Cheltenham and Gloucester. </p> <p>From tomorrow, rural areas in Cumbria and Suffolk could become cut off outside rush hour. </p> <p>Electric trams in Blackpool and Manchester were taking extra passengers and in Merseyside electric trains were preparing to run extra services. </p> <p>But two-thirds of the national train network runs on diesel fuel and the Association of Train Operating Companies said yesterday that companies only had enough to last until Friday. </p> <p>South West Trains began cancelling services yesterday, terminating its London Waterloo to Paignton, south Devon, service around 30 miles short at Exeter. This was likely to be repeated today. </p> <p>The Brighton to Reading service was being terminated at Basingstoke. </p> <p>Railtrack had to call in extra staff to control crowds at peak hour times, and some train companies reported a 50% increase in passengers. </p> <p>Railtrack has brought in extra beds at key locations so that staff can sleep between shifts. Diesel fuel supplies a considerable part of the rural network so train operating companies in these areas will be the first to suffer when supplies dry up. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the British Airports Authority yesterday advised airlines to refuel at Heathrow or Gatwick airports, which have so far been unaffected because they have private pipelines for fuel. East Midlands, Luton and Liverpool airports asked airlines such as Easy Jet to refuel abroad and enter Britain with enough for a round trip. <br> Angelique Chrisafis and Keith Harper </p> <p><b> Health service</b><br> </p> <p>The Department of Health warned last night that the fuel blockade was putting the NHS under \"massive pressure\" as people who could not get home visits by GPs and district nurses turned up at hospitals' accident and emergency departments. Many ambulance crews were answering emergency calls only. </p> <p>A spokesman blamed the crisis for the cancellation of dozens of operations yesterday. \"There is no doubt that the longer the blockades continue, the more chance there is of lives being put at risk,\" he said. </p> <p>\"GPs and district nurses are not able to visit elderly and vulnerable people in their own homes. Ambulances have cancelled non-emergency journeys and NHS staff are having great problems getting to work in many areas. </p> <p>\"This means that operations are now being cancelled and A&amp;E departments are coming under more pressure as people cannot call out doctors easily.\" </p> <p>The department said NHS blood stocks were reasonably high, but fuel shortages were hindering the collection of newly donated blood in some parts of the country. \"Blood supplies are being moved around the country causing delays to deliveries. Vital hospital supplies - including medicines - are beginning to run low in some places,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>NHS managers were working to find emergency fuel supplies and pool meagre resources. Emergency planning teams, normally only used to ease pressures in the health service during the winter, were being set up to deal with the crisis. </p> <p>Some local health authorities were issuing doctors, nurses and other health workers with special certificates to allow them to access emergency fuel supplies. </p> <p>Protesters yesterday allowed fuel supplies earmarked for local ambulance services through the noose round refineries at Stanlow in Cheshire and Grangemouth, near Edinburgh, as well as distribution depots in Ipswich and Leeds. </p> <p>Motorway garages also introduced a guaranteed supply system for emergency services, including all 42 sites run by Granada. London's big hospitals also held a joint meeting to draw up emergency plans to pool fuel for back-up generators if the crisis deepened, while routine operations were cancelled in mid-Wales and Staffordshire ambulances imposed a 55mph limit on non-urgent callouts. <br> John Carvel and Martin Wainwright </p> <p><b> Supermarkets and shops</b><br> </p> <p>Some shops and supermarkets have seen customers clearing the shelves of bread, milk, flour and sugar as panic buying has shifted from petrol to groceries. </p> <p>Although supermarkets assured customers they had enough fuel for food deliveries for the foreseeable future, this actually meant up to the weekend, according to the British Retail Consortium. </p> <p>Drivers at the frozen food company Iceland claimed they would not be able to make food deliveries after tomorrow. </p> <p>Tim Mason, marketing director at Tesco, said yesterday that ultimately fresh food supplies would be affected by the fuel crisis. However, a company spokeswoman said there had been no evidence of panic buying. </p> <p>Staff at shops and supermarkets in the West Country have witnessed panic buying of fresh and dried milk, bread and flour. Pat Bint, acting manageress of Londis in South Cerney, near Cirencester, sold out of bread and milk within 90 minutes of the shop opening yesterday. </p> <p>Sales at Somerfield's supermarket at Malmesbury, Wiltshire, had increased by 7% over the last four days. Shelves were being cleared of bread, milk, eggs and sugar, according to store manager Stuart Yeandel. </p> <p>Roy Litchfield, treasurer of the National Association of Shopkeepers, warned that commerce could grind to a halt because of the shortage of fuel. He said the impact could be felt by shopkeepers within the next five to seven days. \"It is really going to start to bite in the next few days. How are they supposed to get food to people if there is no petrol and there are no buses to transport people into towns and cities?\" <br>Helen Carter </p> <p><b> Business</b><br> </p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry yesterday warned that the country's hard-pressed manufacturing sector would start shutting down production lines today because of the fuel crisis. </p> <p>The motor industry, food processing and steel manufacturing were running out of raw materials, had fuel shortages or had nowhere to store the goods which could not be delivered. </p> <p>Service industries were finding difficulty getting out to see clients and workers in rural areas without public transport could not get to work. </p> <p>A CBI spokesperson said: \"It does look serious but some sectors are worse hit than others.\" </p> <p>Transport companies saw their shares take a battering on the stock market as companies such as P&amp;O, Hays and Excel were marked down by City pessimists. </p> <p>A spokesman for P&amp;O, which delivers containers and other goods from Tilbury and Southampton docks, said the crisis \"is beginning to impede the flow of goods around the country.\" </p> <p>Virgin said its megastores could run out of CDs and mobile phones within two weeks if they could not be restocked. </p> <p>The Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steelmakers and papermakers, said: \"We have seen gas prices rise by 50% this year already and have been having a private fuel crisis which is only just registering with politicians now.\" <br>Terry Macalister </p> <p><b> Local services</b><br> </p> <p>Local authorities have begun suspending non-essential public services amid mounting concern that the continued blockade of refineries and oil depots could soon start to force school closures in some parts of Britain. </p> <p>Council leaders urged ministers to ensure that any emergency powers were used to direct fuel resources to priority areas such as fire services, refuse collection and care services for the elderly and other vulnerable people. </p> <p>Emergency plans have already been drawn up by councils to eke out dwindling fuel stocks by dropping non-essential services such as mobile libraries, grass cutting and street cleaning. </p> <p>In Devon, as in other rural areas, bus operators are being advised not to take children to school unless they know they have enough fuel for the return journey. </p> <p>In Somerset, three rural primary schools will be closed today because staff are unable to get there. Free schoool meals for 10,000 children have been suspended and hundreds of pupils will miss school because some bus companies have run out of fuel. </p> <p>In Leeds, 1,300 children at 11 special schools have been told their bus service may stop. In Essex, 44 pupils at De La Salle secondary school in Basildon woke up to be told their school bus would not be running. In Nottingham, two private bus companies providing school transport are running out of fuel. <br>Geoff Gibbs </p> <p><b> Tourism</b><br> </p> <p>Tourist operators in rural areas said yesterday they were facing a disastrous collapse in bookings unless the fuel crisis was resolved in the next few days. </p> <p>Chris Collier, chief executive of the Cumbria tourist board, said scores of small businesses were likely to fold as holidaymakers rushed to cancel bookings in the Lake District, amid fears that they would become stranded without petrol. </p> <p>She said the tourist board had been inundated by calls from worried hoteliers, including the owner of a bed and breakfast who reported taking cancellations worth \u00a32,500 in the space of a morning. </p> <p>\"The situation is extremely serious for Cumbria,\" she said. \"September and October are traditionally our busiest months, and 95% of our visitors come by car.\" </p> <p>One hotelier in Ambleside said he had lost \u00a31,400 in cancelled bookings in 24 hours. Michael Fletcher, owner of the Nanny Brow country house hotel on Windermere, said he had only a week's supply of fuel oil left to heat the 18-bedroom hotel, and had asked guests to ration the number of baths they take. \"We have quite a lot of staff here and we have to run the place whether we have 25 guests or 10 guests. If we're still in the same situation next week it will start to bite very hard indeed,\" he said. </p> <p>Simon Bradley, the head of operations at South-west Tourism, said the situation was \"very serious\" for the economies of Devon and Cornwall. \"We depend heavily on tourism in this region - in some areas it is the major employer,\" he said. \"Undoubtedly, visitors are deciding not to come and that makes it absolutely crucial that this situation is resolved. September is a critical month.\" One major tourist operator in the south-west said it was laying on accomodation at rock bottom prices in case holidaymakers were stranded without enough fuel to travel home. </p> <p>News of the fuel crisis is beginning to affect bookings from overseas, the British Tourist Authority said, with holidaymakers and business travellers thinking twice about coming to Britain while the shortages continue.</p>",
  "The oil companies were on a collision course with Tony Blair last night over their failure to dispatch tankers from storage depots immediately to replenish the country's empty petrol stations. <p>With a relatively small number of pickets managing to immobilise Britain, some ministers privately accused the companies of either colluding with the protesters or taking a line of no resistance. </p> <p>Police around the country insist that there is free movement in most areas and only limited picketing. But outside some depots small groups of protesters are discussing with managers which deliveries should be allowed and giving \"dispensations\" only to fuel for the emergency services. </p> <p>After crisis talks in Downing Street, John Prescott gave a hint of the government's frustration by telling the companies that it was their responsibility to ensure that supplies got to the forecourts. </p> <p>Ray Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said it was right to ask why tankers were being kept in the depots despite the fact that the police had cleared almost all the blockades. </p> <p>\"It is reasonable to postulate that the oil companies have made a collective decision not to send out their tankers. We have to establish whether there is a real picket line and there is danger to the drivers, or if it is just protesters. And if there is no picket line, then you would be perfectly right to ask why not.\" </p> <p>The government's anger was underlined by Lord Mackenzie, a former senior policeman who now advises the home secretary, Jack Straw, on law and order, who said he was baffled that tankers were not leaving depots. </p> <p>\"It does not add up to me,\" he said. \"The people who are demonstrating, in a sense, I suppose, are supporters of the Conservative party. There's something not right about it. It's not a normal demonstration and they should get their sleeves rolled up and start delivering the oil where it belongs, at the petrol stations.\" </p> <p>Lord Mackenzie, a senior officer during the l984-5 miners' strike, said many protests seemed so minimal that they could not be regarded as picketing. \"Roads are often not blocked - if they were, the police would not hesitate in arresting people,\" he said. \"It seems to be the companies causing the difficulty, and there does seem some collusion with the protesters. Perhaps it's because if the fuel duty was reduced they would sell more petrol.\" </p> <p>With conspiracy theories flying thick and fast, Dave Bryan, the TGWU transport union national officer representing truckers, said tankers were idle \"because there has been a number of incidents in recent days where drivers have been physically abused by motorists and even followed home there is evidence of intimidation\". </p> <p>When the Guardian contacted several leading oil companies, they maintained a common line. Asked why their tankers were not leaving refineries and depots, a spokeswoman for Shell - more than half of whose 1,100 stations are running dry - said: \"We are concerned for the safety of our drivers and do not want to take any risk.\" </p> <p>Asked what threats drivers were facing, she mentioned an \"incident\" last Friday in which a traffic cone was thrown at a tanker. </p> <p>BP, with close to three quarters of its 1,500 stations out of action, came close to hinting it that was the victim of a government-inspired smear campaign, and said tankers would only leave depots with a police escort. </p> <p>The oil companies have been making bumper profits as the result of soaring crude prices, but not from the higher pump prices. Their profit margins on the forecourt are slim because of intense competition . </p> <p>Their profit comes from the rise in wholesale price of the oil they sell on to other corporations. They would like to see the government reduce the cut it takes at the petrol pump to stop consumer anger. </p> <p>In theory the companies can take out injunctions to remove the protesters from their depots and refineries. </p> <p>Andrew Ward, the corporate communications manager of TotalElfFina, told the BBC: \"We have investigated the legal implications of this. We are advised injunctions would be difficult because the protest is not by an official union presence, so therefore it would be difficult to serve injunctions, because we would have to serve many injunctions on individuals.\" </p> <p>Told that the police were saying that the roads were free of illegal picketing, he replied: \"We are at the moment liaising with police on a terminal basis to try and get our vehicles out of the terminals.\" </p> <p>Later, a company spokesman said \"The mood of the protesters is fairly amicable, and if we were to send drivers out it might change. Getting fuel to the pumps would only solve the short-term problem and not deal with the original concerns of protesters.\"</p>",
  "Trade union leaders yesterday queued up to condemn the petrol protesters and called for pickets breaking the law to be arrested. <p>General secretaries criticised the blockades after hearing reports that nurses, council staff and other employees had been told to stay at home. </p> <p>Bill Morris, head of the Transport and General Workers Union, said: \"This campaign has crossed the line from democracy to anarchy. If they are breaking the law, the protesters should be arrested.\" </p> <p>The most effective industrial action for years is overshadowing the annual TUC congress in Glasgow and risks embarrassing a sidelined labour movement. </p> <p>While union delegates discussed training and partnerships with business yesterday, the demonstrators they opposed were triggering Tony Blair's biggest industrial crisis. </p> <p>John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, said the government would have faced even bigger problems if the unions were involved. But the unions' problem is that they are not involved. Instead they are watching helplessly as farmers, self employed drivers and hauliers make the running. </p> <p>An embarrassed senior official in one of Britain's biggest unions joked that the TUC should launch a \"let us work\" campaign against employers in revenge for the 1926 General Strike or, in the spirit of true partnership, join their bosses on the picket lines. </p> <p>Most union leaders have little sympathy with the non-union drivers and firms. They recall that lorry drivers have repeatedly driven through picket lines. </p> <p>Danny Bryan, national secretary of the TGWU's road transport group, accused some pickets of bully-boy tactics. \"We have evidence of the windscreen of a lorry being smashed over the weekend, our drivers being physically abused and there are rumours of drivers being followed to their houses,\" he said. </p> <p>Rodney Bickerstaffe, general secretary of the Unison public service staff union, contrasted the support of Tory tabloids for the oil blockade with their opposition to union strikes. </p> <p>The oil giants, added Mr Bickerstaffe, would almost certainly take legal action against unions if they took industrial action before winning a ballot. </p> <p>\"The vast majority of these pickets are self employed. I'm not saying that there is a conspiracy but I believe that there is an unwritten agreement with the petrol companies.\" </p> <p>Steve Pickering, the GMB deputy general secretary, said: \"It is an amazing situation when bosses are picketing the workers. It would be strange if small businesses and Tory spokespeople were to force concessions by the same tactics they so vehemently denounced during the 1980s.\"</p>",
  "David Blunkett's invocation yesterday of the Winter of Discontent - the industrial explosion that helped sink the last Labour government and the party's bitterest crisis of the past half century - is an unmistakable sign of ministers' determination not to let the hauliers' oil blockade run out of control. <p>\"We are all bound by history,\" he warned. \"We all remember the 'Crisis, what crisis?' of 30 years ago.\" </p> <p>The words Crisis, what crisis? - which actually came 21 years ago - were the Sun's headline caricaturing prime minister Jim Callaghan's apparent nonchalance as he returned from a world summit in Guadeloupe: it epitomised the media onslaught which helped to create a lasting mythology about the strikes. </p> <p>The wave of stoppages dur ing the winter of 1978-79 was targeted at a 5% government pay norm at a time when inflation was almost double that. It followed two years of pay restraint which had seen millions of workers' wages fall in real terms. </p> <p>After the TUC and Labour conferences voted to reject a third year of real pay cuts, one group of workers after another walked out in protest. Ford and bakery workers were followed by railway workers, and petrol tanker and road haulage drivers. By January they had been joined by more than a million low-paid council workers. </p> <p>The pay limit - seen in retrospect as a mistake by the Labour ministers who tried to impose it - was broken. </p> <p>Disruption was widespread, compounded by intensive picketing, and was mercilessly exploited by the opposition leader, Margaret Thatcher. But much of the reporting - of bodies left unburied, for example - was wildly exaggerated. </p> <p>Certainly the 1979 lorry drivers' strikes were a very different industrial phenomenon from the current protests by owner-drivers and farmers against fuel prices and taxes, and, despite dire predictions at the time, their impact on consumers was less dramatic. </p> <p>This week's blockades of fuel depots and refineries are being organised largely by small groups of self-employed hauliers, with apparent toleration from some oil companies and the indulgence of Conservative politicians and newspapers, in support of lower taxes. </p> <p>The pay revolt of 21 years ago was staged by millions of workers, many of them among the lowest-paid in Britain, to head off a further squeeze on their living standards. </p> <p>In the short term at least, it was also successful. </p> <p>The outcome of the current fuel tax protests remains to be seen.</p>",
  "Returning from the UN special assembly in New York last week, Tony Blair was relatively confident that his government would see off the just-gathering petrol blockades. <p>In a private conversation, President Jacques Chirac had told him that the French government would not make concessions to the farmers and hauliers paralysing his country. It seemed to Mr Blair that this might even be the moment when the Socialist French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, confronted the labour unions and irrevocably joined the Blairite Third Way. </p> <p>By the weekend Mr Blair was rudely disappointed as Mr Jospin succumbed first to the fishermen and then to the hauliers. </p> <p>Just as capital has globalised, so has protest. It gave fresh heart to the nascent demonstrations in Britain. </p> <p>But at Chequers Mr Blair had other things on his mind. He had sent troops to fight in the Sierra Leone jungle, and he had to brace himself for the potentially damaging serialised books portraying a feuding cabinet and a jealous chancellor. </p> <p>Over the weekend he held two conversations with Gordon Brown, and they agreed that the best solution was to put pressure on Opec members, particularly the Saudis, to bring the price of oil down to as low as $24 a barrel. </p> <p><b> Caught out</b><br> </p> <p>Mr Brown, who had been repeatedly warned by Scottish Labour MPs of the danger of the high petrol prices, promised that he would ensure that EU finance ministers stood firm against fuel tax cuts. The pressure on Opec to increase output would remain. </p> <p>In retrospect, Whitehall admits that it was slow to recognise the speed with which the crisis would escalate. Mentally, ministers remembered the miners' strike of 1984-5 and the unions' failure to halt energy supplies. No one foresaw the scale of the menace ahead. One reason for that, it seems, is that there is no coordinating machinery to report to ministers that garage forecourts could be pumped dry. </p> <p>By Sunday, however, it was apparent that panic buying was starting to eat into supplies much faster than expected, especially in the north and Wales. It was agreed that Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, should convene an emergency meeting of the civil contingencies committee. </p> <p>It was also agreed that Mr Blair should go ahead with a two-day visit to the midlands and Yorkshire, designed to highlight the burgeoning dot.com economy. Cancelling would be to betray signs of panic and increase the run on petrol. </p> <p>The visit rapidly developed a surreal quality. The more Mr Blair enthused about the increasing pace of internet traffic in Britain, the slower vehicle traffic moved around the country. Privately, he knew that two of his industry ministers had rushed to Balmoral for the Queen's consent to invoke emergency powers. </p> <p>He had decided that he faced a battle of wills. There would be no change in petrol duty outside the normal budgetary cycle. He would not meet the protesters, or even the Road Haulage Association. The price of petrol was not out of line with Europe, and in any case the farmers did not pay special levies. </p> <p>The country would have to be patient as the oil price came down. In Thatcherite tones, he told colleagues that he would not be held to ransom. \"We cannot allow what happened in France to happen here.\" </p> <p>But there was also a mystery. His Whitehall planners had told him there were enough oil refineries, and enough of them unblocked, to ensure a proper flow of petrol. The picketing was good-natured and did not represent a genuine unlawful blockade, the police had reported. The oil companies said their drivers feared physical intimidation if they went through the picket lines. </p> <p>Mr Blair concluded that there needed to be greater coordination between the oil companies and the police.The police said the depot exits could be cleared if the tanker drivers were willing to use them. The oil companies said otherwise: the safety of their drivers was paramount. </p> <p>Why were the oil companies refusing to ask their drivers to go through the picket lines? One view in government circles is that oil company drivers have a lot of sympathy with the hauliers. They do the same job, share the same motorway cafes, and know that many hauliers are close to the financial edge. Some political sources pointed out that the oil companies had little economic stake in preserving the current level of petrol duty. </p> <p>By mid-evening he knew his tour was becoming untenable. The last straw came when he had to pull out of a dinner to celebrate John Prescott's 30 years as a Hull MP: protesters had blocked the routes to the restaurant with their cars. He drove back to the Sheffield Hilton where, in further overnight conversations, it was agreed that he had to return to London. </p> <p>The Education Secretary, David Blunkett, was left to spell out the eerie historical parallels with the Winter of Discontent. He said: \"We are all bound in by our history and we all remember the 'Crisis? What crisis?' of 30 years ago. The Prime Minister needs to be able to sit down, take the necessary advice and to decide what measures need to be taken. We are on the edge of a very real problem. The problem we face is panic buying. We need to ask people to be very calm, not [to] believe we are going to run out of petrol.\" </p> <p>By lunchtime Mr Blair was in Downing Street discussing the crisis with Mr Prescott; the Chief Secretary, Andrew Smith; the police; civil servants; the Industry Secretary, Mr Byers; and Mr Straw. Once again he focused on the companies' refusal to distribute petrol and decided to speak to their chief executives personally. </p> <p>At lunchtime Mr Prescott finally made the government's anger clear. \"We are quite convinced that the oil companies can face up to their responsibilities to see that oil is distributed properly.\" </p> <p><b>The special powers:</b></p> <p>\u0095 The Queen has given the government unprecedented powers to assume control of fuel distribution to keep the emergency services going: the cabinet's emergency contingency committee can instruct oil companies to deliver to ambulances, hospitals and schools </p> <p>\u0095 Ministers on the committee are expected to list up to 200 filling stations solely for the emergency services. Police will be in attendance in case of protests </p> <p>\u0095 If necessary the provision can be extended to buses and supermarkets to ensure that food supplies are maintained </p> <p>\u0095 At the Balmoral Privy Council meeting the Queen approved an order in council to set in motion the powers \"because there is imminent in the United Kingdom a threatened emergency affecting fuel supplies which make it necessary in Her Majesty's Opinion that the government should temporarily have at its disposal exceptional powers for controlling the sources and availability of energy\" </p> <p>\u0095 If protesters refuse to let oil tankers leave refineries, the government could fall back on a 1,500-mile network of pipes, normally used to to distribute fuel to military bases, to distribute civilian fuel </p> <p><b> Nicholas Watt </b> and<b> Michael White</b></p>",
  "Six days ago there was nothing more to be seen than a cloud over Cheshire, the size of a band of farmers on a freelance expedition to try to shut down a single refinery. Now there is raging crisis: the prime minister back in London, having called off all other engagements to take charge of the government response; petrol supplies exhausted throughout the capital and forecasts that very soon none will be left anywhere in the country. How could this autumn of discontent have blown up so fast out of nowhere? <p>The government was all too clearly unprepared for the scale of it. On Monday evening, as the lights went out in service stations all over Britain, Mr Blair was still trying to keep a dinner date with John Prescott in Hull. Ministers had badly underestimated the forces ranged against them. What had begun as a rising of the Poujadist self-employed, a political constituency with which past Labour governments might have been only too happy to do battle, was now looking much more formidable. People whose roads were obstructed, who were forced to sit for hours in queues to fill up their tanks, seemed on the whole more upset by the chancellor's tax take than they were with those causing disruption. Whatever they thought of the tactics, they welcomed action which if successful would cut their own petrol bills. </p> <p> So the government's message of \"no surrender, wait for the budget\" failed to find many takers. Nor did it play too well at the TUC yesterday, as Gordon Brown insisted that Labour must not amend its strategy to deal with an oil price increase which might prove only temporary. The trouble is that all experts see prices continuing to climb; none predicts a slipping back to acceptable levels. But by now, pertinent questions were surfacing as to how and why the protest movement has achieved such swift, overpowering success. Why have the pumps run dry when the picketing in many places was light, verging on vestigial? Why have oil companies made so little apparent effort to lift what in many places was hardly more than a token siege? Why, where the police had cleared the barricades out of the way, was nothing, even now, moving? One analyst even alleged that oil companies wanted to see the demonstrations succeed, in the hope that the chancellor would be forced to cut tax, thus boosting their takings. </p> <p>The sun must have come out in Downing Street as the first signs appeared that the focus of public disquiet was switching from government unreadiness to oil company duplicity. But that could yet switch back again. Beyond Tony Blair's upbeat assessment and promised measures last night, he and Mr Brown need to move fast and purposefully to recapture control of the agenda. They need to be far more robust in defending taxes on petrol as essential to protect our threatened environment. They need to show that the Treasury's windfall from petrol price increases (a mere \u00a3400m in the past year, the chancellor says) will not simply disappear into the Treasury's maw, but be used for the public's long-term benefit through spending on enhanced public transport and investment in alternative sources of power. They must also resist the temptation to talk, as Jack Straw regrettably did yesterday, as if all street demonstrations, whatever their cause, constitute a form of disruption which society should not tolerate. Where disruption takes forms which are clearly illegal, there must be action to stop it. Where it is merely troublesome and discomforting for authority, no government with any liberal pretensions should try to deny its legitimacy.</p>",
  "A German friend told me how she had once gone to see an English acquaintance at her workplace. <p>As she was taking off her coat she asked who the Africans were in the outer office. Her English acquaintance was nonplussed.</p> <p>\"Africans?\" she asked. \"Yes. You must know they're there - all those black people taking down files and writing out forms.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, them,\" said the Englishwoman. \"No. They're not Africans. They're British.\"</p> <p>My German friend says it was a moment that changed her whole outlook on a part of life.</p> <p>\"For the first time, I realised you could have a concept of citizenship that was completely separate from the idea of ethnic origin.\"</p> <p>Her anecdote is particularly relevant in the week in which a new commission, headed by the respected Christian Democrat politician, Rita S\u00fcssmuth, starts work on a what promises to be a lengthy review of Germany's laws on nationality and immigration.</p> <p>German, like Britain, has begun to suspect that it needs more, nor less, immigrants for its economic wellbeing.</p> <p>But in Germany, to a far greater extent than in Britain, the issue is bedevilled by the concept of citizenship which my friend had unwittingly carried around with her till the day she went to that office in London.</p> <p>But then it was only last year that a law was introduced by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's centre-left coalition to break the bond between blood and nationality.</p> <p>It allowed foreigners to become citizens after living in Germany for eight years, provided they gave up their existing passport.</p> <p>Those who had been born in Germany of foreign parents could keep dual citizenship, but were obliged to choose which to keep by the age of 23.</p> <p>By the time it became law, the measure had been watered down in response to bitter resistance, including a petition got up by the opposition Christian Democrats.</p> <p>The new nationality law cost the Social Democrats, the senior partners in the ruling coalition, a defeat in the first regional vote to be held after their general election victory - a result which, in turn, cost them their majority in the regionally appointed upper house.</p> <p>Like my friend, Germans of all classes and persuasions had been conditioned by the fact that, for years, both main parties subscribed to the view that Germany - to use the stock phrase - was \"not a country of immigration\".</p> <p>It was thus neither feasible nor desirable for people to be both black and German.</p> <p>Or to be German and, say, Turkish or Serbian or Italian by origin. Even if you had been born in Germany and spoke accentless German, you could not be a German citizen unless your parents were.</p> <p>Yet the country was, and is, teeming with people of foreign origin. More than seven million of Germany's 82m inhabitants are what, in other countries, would be called immigrants. But not here.</p> <p>One group is made up of the workers from Mediterranean Europe who provided the cheap labour for the \"economic miracle\" and their families.</p> <p>For decades, the politicians sustained the myth that they would one day go home. They were thus not immigrants, but \"Gastarbeiter\" (guest workers).</p> <p>The other group was made up of those who had been accepted since. But they were let in as asylum seekers. The authorities knew full well that most were not genuine political refugees.</p> <p>According to official estimates, only five per cent of those who entered in the early 1990s were fleeing political persecution. But, again, the important thing was to sustain the idea that Germany was \"not a country of immigration\".</p> <p>One result is that Germans continue to refer to the seven million people of foreign origin in their midst, as \"foreigners\" or, at best, \"Mitb\u00fcrger\".</p> <p>At first, that sounds fine. Its dictionary definition is \"co-citizen\". But then, strictly speaking, \"Mitarbeiter\" means \"co-worker\", and in practice it is used as a euphemism for \"employee\".</p> <p>The unspoken tenent is that Germany's foreigners are in the country on sufferance. It is one that infuses all areas of life, as the setting up of the S\u00fcssmuth commission on immigration demonstrated.</p> <p>Until the fact was pointed out by irate leaders of the Turkish community, it had no one on it to represent the views of Germany's almost non-exisitent immigrants.</p>",
  "If all had gone according to plan, today, September 13, would have seen the birth of the state of Palestine, after a gestation period of more than 50 years. <p>But instead of a state - whose due date was delayed for the second time at the weekend - there is the birth of a strange new vocabulary, the creation of those trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> <p>Their offerings include: divided sovereignty, joint sovereignty, shared sovereignty, delayed sovereignty, suspended sovereignty, functional sovereignty, custodial sovereignty and extraterritorial sovereignty.</p> <p>Because while the battle of sovereignty may seem archaic in an age of globalisation and free trade, this is the Holy Land, where religion, history and sacred sites complicate everything.</p> <p>The newly minted terminology is intended to apply to the Haram al-Sharif, as Muslims call it, or Temple Mount as it is called by the Jews.</p> <p>The site, within the walls of the old city of Jerusalem, is revered equally by Muslims and Jews, and claimed with equal passion by Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>The Haram, which contains the shimmering gold Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosques, is the third holiest shrine in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.</p> <p>For Jews, it is the most sacred soil on the planet, the site of their temple, which was destroyed in 70 AD except for the Wailing Wall, and is visited by hundreds of worshippers every day.</p> <p>The panoply of definitions, which have come into wide circulation in the last two months, represent attempts by those trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to strip the notion of sovereignty of its emotional charge.</p> <p>The logic behind the lexicon is to finesse the present understandings of sovereignty so that both sides can claim victory in the most intractable of their disputes, thus overcoming the single most formidable obstacle to peace in the Middle East.</p> <p>Today, Israeli radio talk shows invented yet another definition: vertical sovereignty. However, that may just be a fancy way of describing subterranean sovereignty.</p> <p>That would see the Palestinians declared the masters of the Haram al-Sharif from the ground up, granting them control of the plateau where the mosques stand, but leaving Israel in control of the ground beneath, where the ruins of the temple are believed to lie.</p> <p>Or humans could simply appeal to the almighty to take the whole dispute off their hands: divine sovereignty.</p> <p>That would grant God title to the Haram, leaving mere mortals with the task of delegating responsibility for such human concerns as policing, rubbish collection, and the issuing of renovation permits for the holy site.</p> <p>The inspiration for such creative solutions to the future dispensation of the Haram has come from some unexpected quarters - the frozen ice cap of Antarctica, a US naval base in the Caribbean, and the secessionist-minded Canadian province of Quebec.</p> <p>At one point, Israeli academics were considering the International Law of the Sea as a possible model for land-locked Jerusalem.</p> <p>The treaty assigns rights to oil, gas and fishing up to 12 miles beyond a country's shoreline - or \"functional sovereignty\".</p> <p>Then there is \"qualified sovereignty\" or \"relative sovereignty\", which describes the extra autonomy enjoyed by the Canadian province of Quebec.</p> <p>Although such ideas are engaging, many Israelis - including the former prime minister and Nobel peace prize laureate, Shimon Peres, has dismissed these efforts are word play.</p> <p>They are seen as far less benign by Palestinians, who accuse Israel of presenting these ideas as fancy formulas to prevent Yasser Arafat from exercising full sovereignty over all areas of East Jerusalem occupied by Israel since 1967.</p> <p>Some of the Israeli proposals would merely sanction the status quo, under which, Israel has exercised ultimate security control over the Haram, while the Palestinians, through the Muslim Waqf, or property trust, are in charge of daily administration.</p> <p>As might have been predicted, the welter of definitions has encouraged imitators, although some are less than earnest.</p> <p>When the idea of God's sovereignty, which was first raised by Jordan in the mid-90s was aired in the Israeli press, some commentators were less than reverential.</p> <p>\"Which God should get sovereignty? The Lord of Hosts, Allah or the father of Jesus?\" asked Zvi Barel, an Arab affairs columnist for Ha'aretz newspaper.</p> <p>\"Maybe the best idea of all would be to transfer sovereignty over the entire Temple Mount compound to the Disney company so it could build a Park of Holies there.\"</p>",
  "TUC leaders yesterday accused the government of undermining its campaign for entry to the euro by watering down improved employment rights and denying UK workers benefits enjoyed by the rest of Europe. <p>But efforts to unite British unions behind a compromise policy on the single currency, before the general election, fell apart when Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU, and Sir Ken Jackson of the AEEU, reignited their public row over how to handle the issue. </p> <p>John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said the best way for the government to fight its pro-Europe campaign was to set out a vision of a Europe that brought social progress and benefits. </p> <p>\"But, frankly, it does not help us to build a positive case for Europe if the TUC has to keep taking the British government to the European court of justice to win back employment rights which are clearly enshrined in European directives and which are freely accepted elsewhere in Europe,\" he said. \"I would like to see [this] Labour government leading Europe on social improvements, not being the last in a very long convoy expressing arrogant disapproval.\" </p> <p>The TUC is appalled that the government cut the three to four weeks annual holiday guaranteed under EU law to take account of public holidays, and won public backing from Anna Diamantopoulou, the Brussels employment and social affairs commissioner, for its stance. </p> <p>Ms Diamantopoulou told the annual congress in Glasgow that the UK had a poor track record on social partnership, whereas the EU envisaged a much longer role for unions in collective bargaining on issues such as new forms of jobs, and favoured modern regulation rather than deregulation. The EU's social policy agenda, she said, was critical to the success of transforming Europe into a 10,000bn-euro economy, with living standards up 25%, within the next five years. </p> <p>Tony Dubbins, leader of the GPMU print union, said: \"To persuade people to vote for the euro, it has to be integrated with a government commitment to underwrite and extend the social dimension.\" </p> <p>The united front shown by unions backing the euro collapsed when Mr Morris said the British people could not be \"bullied or bounced\" into adopting the single currency. He said: \"There is no majority in the country for the single currency. No wonder, because we have a strong economy and a stable currency. Investors have confidence in our country despite some of us running Britain down. Foreign investment rose last year by 25%.\" </p> <p>Sir Ken, the target of this jibe, insisted that foreign investors had warned him and Tony Blair they would pull out of Britain if the government did not clarify its position on the euro. He said of Mr Morris that he was \"the only man who can support the chancellor and the shadow chancellor [Michael Portillo] on the same day\". </p> <p>Mr Morris's approach was echoed by a fervent anti-euro proponent, Fawzi Abrahim of the college lecturers' union, Natfhe, who said the motion was \"tainted\" because it did not represent the views of the trade union movement. </p> <p>\"It talks of ensuring members understand the benefits of joining as if they were stupid, but they do understand,\" he said, pointing out that two years of TUC campaigning had produced more people opposed to UK entry. </p> <p>The only thing that united the TUC was the common view that Britain could not join at the exchange rate of DM3.20. That was \"a suicide note for much of our economy\", said Mr Edmonds, who saw it as a compelling reason against immediate entry. Unions now favour an entry rate of about DM2.80.</p>",
  "The United Nations security council is to agree a resolution on Friday to increase its peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone from 13,000 to 20,000, a move it is hoped will end the bitter dispute between the Indians and Nigerians over leadership. <p>Diplomats see the increase as an opportunity to remove the controversial Indian commander of the UN force in Sierra Leone, Major-General Vijay Jetley, who is due to finish his term in November. </p> <p>A memo leaked to the Guardian last weekend revealed him to be at loggerheads with the Nigerian contingent. The Nigerians are now threatening not to serve under him. </p> <p>Ambassadors representing the UN security council members met in New York on Monday to discuss the Sierra Leone crisis. </p> <p>The draft resolution they agreed, which they described as close to the final version that will go before the security council on Friday, will not only increase the size of the peacekeeping force but widen its remit and change the command structure. </p> <p>The strengthened force will increase the UN's annual bill for Sierra Leone from an estimated $400m (\u00a3285m) to $780m (\u00a3555m). </p> <p>The Nigerians will be pleased to see Gen Jetley lose the command. But, in a move that will anger the Nigerians, some permanent members of the security council are pushing for another Indian to replace him. The final decision will be made by the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan. </p> <p>One diplomat, with inside information about the negotiations at the UN, said that although the Nigerians had the biggest contingent, there was resistance to giving them the command. </p> <p>Mr Annan warned on Monday that the UN, the government of Sierra Leone and west African nations must \"harmonise\" their work if peace is to be restored to Sierra Leone. </p> <p>The draft resolution notes \"with concern serious shortfalls in capability encountered by Unamsil (the UN mission in Sierra Leone) in the recent past with regard to the command and control, equipment, training and preparation of military personnel and the implementation of rules of engagement\". </p> <p>It adds that success of the mission will depend on \"an effective command and control structure and capacity, a single chain of command and the commitment to implement the mandate\". </p> <p>That mandate is to be made clearer: to respond robustly to any hostile action and \"to extend state authority, restore law and order and further stabilise the situation progressively throughout the entire country\". </p> <p>Gen Jetley's memo complained that Nigerian politicians and soldiers had been sabotaging the peace effort in order to prolong the profits they were making from illegally trading in diamonds from Sierra Leone. </p> <p>In response to the accusations, the Nigerian chief of army staff, Major-General Victor Malu, said his army could no longer serve under Gen Jetley and has demanded his immediate removal. </p> <p>\"We are not going to serve under that man in whatever circumstances. If he is not removed, he will not get our cooperation, and we are the largest contingent in the force,\" he said. </p> <p>The two most senior Nigerian officials implicated in the report - Mr Annan's special representative in Freetown, under-secretary-general Oluyemi Adeniji, and Gen Jetley's immediate subordinate, Brigadier General Mohammed Garba - have both denounced the memo. </p> <p>The increase in the number of troops to 20,000 means a higher-ranking soldier than Gen Jetley will be required. Western diplomats see that as a stroke of luck as it provides an excuse for his removal but they are equally adamant that he will not be replaced by any of the existing Nigerian commanders in Sierra Leone, whom they regard as being equally culpable for the row. </p> <p>\"You'd have to say that all of their positions are untenable,\" said one senior UN official. \"Jetley clearly does not command the confidence of the largest contingent in his force. The Nigerians have stopped just short of saying they won't obey his orders. But there is also a strong feeling among the other contingents that whatever Jetley's shortcomings as a commander he is basically right about the Nigerians. </p> <p>\"There are not many here who want to be commanded by them because they don't trust them to serve the interests of Sierra Leone or the UN.\" </p> <p>After the Guardian's revelations, Gen Malu responded by accusing Gen Jetley of \"trying to justify his ineptitude, inaction and inefficiency in the leadership of a multinational force\" and that he is resentful of the Nigerians because they opposed the \"dominance of Indian generals\" at the UN's headquarters in Freetown. </p> <p>Gen Jetley, who has been resting in New Delhi after suffering from malaria, has said he cannot recall writing the report and declined to comment. The UN insists that he will be returning to his post next week despite considerable speculation in his Freetown headquarters that the general will not be back.</p>",
  "The increasingly accident-prone Bush presidential campaign was accused of dirty tricks yesterday, after it was discovered that the word \"rats\" appeared subliminally in a Republican political broadcast targeting Democratic health care proposals. <p>The offending word, in large white capital letters, flashes against a black background for a thirtieth of a second as a woman narrator criticises Vice President Al Gore's plan for government funding of prescriptions for pensioners. </p> <p>George W Bush ridiculed as \"bizarre and weird\" accusations that his campaign was trying to use such underhand techniques to discredit his opponent. Yesterday, however, he announced that the $2.5m (\u00a31.3m) advertising campaign would be withdrawn. </p> <p>Alex Castellanos, the Republican campaigner responsible for producing the advertisment denied trying to send subliminal messages. </p> <p>\"We don't play ball that way. I'm not that clever,\" he said. </p> <p>However, Mr Castellanos has been involved in controversial political broadcasts before. In 1990 he produced an advertisement for the rightwing Republican senator for North Carolina, Jesse Helms, which used racial imagery in a contest with a black businessman, Harvey Gant. At one point a white pair of hands receives a job rejection letter and crumples it up, but for a fraction of a second the letter fades to a picture of Mr Gant and the hands appear to be crushing his head. </p> <p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who analyses the advertisement in her book Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction and Democracy, said Mr Castellanos insisted then that the imagery was accidental. Ms Jamieson believes the Helms advertisement was the first instance of subliminal imagery in US political advertising and Mr Castellanos's \"rats advertisement\" is the second. </p> <p>Gore campaign workers were scarcely able to contain their glee yesterday as the Bush campaign was forced into emergency damage limitation for the second time in eight days, at a time when it is losing ground in the polls. </p> <p>Last Monday - apparently unaware that he was speaking close to a live microphone - Mr Bush was overheard describing a New York Times reporter as \"a major-league asshole\". The reporter, Adam Clymer, had written a critical account of the Texas governor's record on health care, and the gaffe made Mr Bush appear peevish and unsettled. </p> <p>Campaigning in Florida yesterday, the candidate seemed rattled by the new controversy yesterday, struggling to pronounce the word \"subliminal\", and raising doubts as to whether he understood its meaning when he argued: \"The idea of one frame out of 900 hardly in my judgment makes a conspiracy.\" </p> <p>After seeing a double-digit lead in the polls evaporate in less than a month, splits have emerged in the Bush camp over how to pursue the campaign, and when to \"go negative\". Last week the candidate's staff were trying to increase their control over the Republican National Committee's campaign office responsible for producing political broadcasts, because it was unhappy about the harshly negative tone of some of its output. </p> <p>Mr Castellanos insisted that the word had appeared accidentally as part of a visual effect which broke up words from campaign slogans into fragments and flashed them across the screen. The word \"rats\" was supposed to be part of \"bureaucrats\", he said. </p> <p>In the controversial segment of the advertisement, other words and groups of letters appear before the slogan \"The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide\" crystallises on the screen. However, the word \"rats\" is larger than the other word-fragments. </p> <p>The word was spotted only after 4,400 screenings in 33 regions, by a Democratic supporter in Seattle, Gary Greenup, who alerted his local party. </p> <p>\"Initially, I was just kind of intrigued... but when I taped it and looked it I thought this is not really very good. It's somewhat underhand and a little bit devious and it should be brought to light.\"</p>",
  "The government has agreed to give the public some form of access to details of sex offenders, the parents of the murdered eight-year-old schoolgirl Sarah Payne said yesterday. <p>Emerging after an hour-long meeting with the Home Office minister Paul Boateng, Michael and Sara Payne said he had agreed to their request for a version of a \"Sarah's law\", giving parents access to the sex offenders register. </p> <p>Outside the Home Office headquarters in central London, Mrs Payne said: \"We have been assured there will be a Sarah's law. We are very happy indeed. It's what we were all working so hard for. Unfortunately we haven't got our daughter, but it might help somebody else's.\" </p> <p>Mr and Mrs Payne refused to give further details of assurances made by Mr Boateng. </p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"There were constructive discussions between Mr Boateng and the family of Sarah Payne. The proposed direction of government policy was part of those discussions. We expect to make an announcement shortly.\" </p> <p>She refused to give further details of what had been agreed or to confirm claims that Mr Boateng had promised to introduce a Sarah's law. </p> <p>Ministers have been looking at ways to strengthen police powers to deal with paedophiles, expected to be announced this month. These could allow police to photograph and question offenders on the register, and possibly authorise police to enter and search their homes. </p> <p>But the plans had been expected to stop short of a Sarah's law - based on the US Megan's law, named for a schoolgirl killed by a paedophile in California in 1994 - making the names and addresses of sex offenders public. </p> <p>Access to the information varies from state to state. In some states, names and pictures can be downloaded from a police website. </p> <p>There has been scepticism over how effective Megan's law has been in stopping offenders repeating their crimes. The law has also been undermined by vigilante attacks. </p> <p>In Britain only the police and certain other officials have access to the sex offenders' register. It has a higher compliance rate of offenders keeping it updated than US equivalents. </p> <p>The former Tory home secretary, Michael Howard, said he had considered a British version of Megan's law in 1997 when the sex offences register was launched, but rejected the idea after advisers warned him of the dangers of paedophiles going to ground. </p> <p>Lawyers have warned that the move could be challenged as a breach of the right to privacy guaranteed by the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>The Paynes were whisked off in a Jaguar with the News of the World's editor, Rebekah Wade, and managing editor Stuart Kuttner, who also attended the meeting. The paper has been campaigning for the introduction of a Sarah's law. </p> <p>This included \"naming and shaming\" people on the sex offenders register by publishing their details, a move thought to have led to vigilante attacks on innocent people. </p> <p>Before the meeting, the Paynes handed the home secretary, Jack Straw, a 700,000-name petition calling for a Sarah's law, mainly from News of the World readers. </p> <p>The couple, from Hersham, Surrey, said Mr Straw agreed to the need for tougher sentencing and more powers for families of victims. </p> <p>Mr Payne said the massive public support for their campaign since their daughter was snatched on July 1 from a country lane near her grandparents' home in Kingston, West Sussex, had helped them cope with her death.</p>",
  "<p>As battles for control of middling-sized British corporates go, the antics surrounding the future of our glorious 200 year-old London Stock Exchange take some beating. </p> <p>Yesterday's admission that the merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse is dead in its current un-thought-through form was inevitable. The whole idea was badly planned and terribly presented from the outset. </p> <p>With hindsight, one of the great howlers of the aborted iX deal was the idea that trading in \"growth\" companies go to Frankfurt, while blue chip trading was to reside in London. Who, one senior market man asked recently, might decide what is a growth company and what is not - since anyone who has the ability to spot them should have retired by now to somewhere warm and light on taxes. </p> <p>The deal was not thought through in advance. So it is little surprise to learn now that the exchange's management did not feel capable of fending off the hostile approach from Sweden's OM, while simultaneously selling (if that is the word) the London-Frankfurt merger to their shareholders, who also double up as their customers. </p> <p>The exchange is now a commercial business and has to play by the corporate rule-book. In turn, corporate precedent says that when a management sees its plans for the business trashed by the owners and then lands itself with an opportunistic approach from a predatory rival, the owners tend to move in and sack the managers. An experienced pair of hands is then installed who can be trusted with extracting value and/or rebuilding the confidence required to remain independent. </p> <p>In the case of the exchange, this is a bit tricky, since the new chairman, Don Cruickshank, was supposed to be the very man. (And anyway, David James is much too busy folding up that tent in south east London.) </p> <p>On the other hand, the position of Michael Marks, a board member and a grandee of the London stock market in every sense, is much clearer. It is untenable. </p> <p>Traditionally, the authorities (including the exchange itself and the financial services authority) have always frowned on City advisers who sit on the boards of corporate clients. Whatever the Chinese walls, there is perceived to be a potential conflict of interest. In the case of Mr Marks, his firm, Merrill Lynch, is the exchange's prime corporate finance adviser as well as its biggest customer. </p> <p>More to the point, whether he likes it or not, Mr Marks is credited as the architect of the iX merger. He should resign now before the shareholders vote him off the podium at Thursday's annual general meeting. </p> <p>But regardless of who sits around the exchange's boardroom table, mapping the future of this institution has not become any simpler after yesterday's events. The pressure for consolidation, in order to bring transaction costs down, is as great as ever. At the same time, there is no sign that the regulatory hurdles - where varying market rules, tax regimes, and supervisory structures in different jurisdictions make seamless cross-border equity trading impossible - are being dismantled. </p> <p>This is an area where a confident London Stock Exchange, in partnership with the FSA, should be taking a European lead. </p> <p>For all its flaws and technicalities and suspicious price movements, the London market remains rich in terms of integrity and practical experience - certainly when compared with any bourse on the continent. Sadly, rather than confidence, all any of us expect in the short term is more bureaucratic squabbling, with the occasional outburst of bluster. </p> <p><strong> Next lesson </strong><br> </p> <p>Just 18 months ago, Next's finance director David Keens declared that people who wanted to choose clothes on the internet were \"sad\". </p> <p>He dismissed the idea of putting the company's clothes catalogue online, because he thought Next's customers were too impatient to wait for pictures to download. Since Mr Keens' attack of foot-in-mouth disease, the group has put more than 1,200 pictures of shirts, skirts and jackets on the web. Next now expects more than \u00a320m of online sales this year. </p> <p>Mr Keens was guilty of underestimating the appeal of Next's unthreatening, classic clothes - even internet addicts want to get their hands on them. </p> <p>Others have made a similar mistake - it has taken the City years to come round to the company. </p> <p>Next has pulled off quite a feat by prospering while the rest of the middle-market has been suffering. Its secret is simple - each year it takes its unexciting range and just adds a few trendy twists. The company has stuck to one brand, avoiding the trap of diversifying into unknown areas. Others, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, should watch and learn.</p>",
  "<p>Celltech, Britain's biggest biotech company, yesterday moved into the black for the first time but saw its shares dive 5% as analysts branded its interim results \"uninspiring\". </p> <p>The Slough-based group, which recently entered the FTSE 100 index, made profits of \u00a310.7m before exceptional items, largely owing to its acquisition of drugs firm Medeva in January. </p> <p>Finance director Peter Allen said: \"These profits are a first for us but we're rather cautious about life. We view them as just a start.\" </p> <p>By buying Medeva, Celltech added a sales network and a portfolio of mature drugs to its portfolio of emerging products. However, Medeva operating profits fell slightly during the period to \u00a325.7m, owing to declining sales of its top three drugs. </p> <p>Mr Allen said the fall was due to Celltech's policy of encouraging customers to keep lower stocks of the key drugs - methylphenidate for attention deficit disorder, Tussionex for flu and heart drug Zaroxolyn. </p> <p>The figures were accompanied by the unexpected departure of Garry Watts, the former finance director of Medeva who was retained after the takeover to continue running the business. Mr Allen said: \"We wanted somebody with more of a pharmaceutical background than an accounting background.\" </p> <p>Initial sales of Mylotarg, the recently launched drug for leukaemia, reached $3.8m. But analysts were disappointed by a modest contribution from Chirocaine, the group's new anaesthetic. Mr Allen admitted that it would take time to establish, saying: \"Anaesthetists are a relatively conservative bunch.\" </p> <p>There was also concern at the size of a \u00a3349m goodwill charge on the purchase of Medeva. Eva Haas of Old Mutual Securities said: \"I'm mildly disappointed with the results. Some people might say that the size of this goodwill charge means they rather drastically overpaid for Medeva.\" </p> <p>Celltech's shares closed down 77p at \u00a344.20. Steve McGarry of Goldman Sachs said: \"There's nothing really here to excite the market.\"</p>",
  "There are fears that organised crime is spiralling out of control in Kosovo after the murder of a senior Albanian official working for the UN mission in the province. <p>The UN has ordered a security review for local staff after the mission's director of planning, reconstruction and development, Rexhep Luci, was shot dead in what K-For officials say was a \"mafia\" killing. </p> <p>Unidentified gunmen shot Luci, 58, in the back six times as he returned to his apartment in the regional capital, Pristina, on Monday evening. </p> <p>Luci's tasks included signing demolition orders for illegal buildings. At the time of his murder, the department was in the process of demolishing a hotel complex. </p> <p>Colleagues said Luci had been threatened twice in the last 10 days. </p> <p>An initial K-For report on the killing says Luci may have been killed by \"mafia\" figures related to the hotel industry. </p> <p>The hotel complex was partly financed by the Kosovo Hotels Association, which the department said was set up by former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army who seized control of property across the province when Nato troops entered Kosovo last June.</p>",
  "Still the skies darken for the Millennium Dome and its ministerial chief, Lord Falconer. On the back of last week's \u00a347m bail-out by national lottery money and the verdict of David James, the corporate fixer brought in as chairman to resuscitate the project, that the dome was built in the wrong place, too quickly and should probably not have been built at all, comes the news that Nomura, the Japanese bank which had been planning to buy the site for \u00a3105m, has pulled out of the deal. This appears to bring down the curtain on what had been the project's one bright prospect and makes the question of whether Lord Falconer has a right to continue in office more urgent. <p>Not that Nomura should escape blame. At first glance one might think that a bank which had offered hard cash and a realistic future as a theme park for the corpse of a dying attraction would be the wounded party. Far from it. Though Nomura abandoned the deal only after getting a comprehensive briefing from the author of a crucial report on the dome's financial position, this report (which neither Nomura nor the public have been allowed to see) is not the only cause of the breakdown. Its details have been known for some time and for the bank to cite them now as its excuse for quitting is unconvincing, as is talk of blaming 12 small holes in the building's great plastic roof. Some may suspect a mere negotiating ploy; after all, Nomura announced its decision as ministers reeled under a still greater crisis. </p> <p>This, though, may not help Lord Falconer, whose continual refusals to resign begin to look foolish. Not long ago he had a viable defence: that the errors which doomed the dome occurred before he took office and that he had done all he could to save the project, not least by selling it to Nomura. Now that has been blown apart. Under his watch things have gone badly wrong, even as he has insisted that they were going right. Nor does he seem to have acted on these problems. It is stretching credibility to believe that he was not aware of the background to the inconsistencies cited by Nomura as a reason for abandoning the deal, yet he seems to have ignored them. The dome may yet end up with Nomura, or may be picked up by the Legacy consortium, whose hopeful bid the government previously rejected. Or it may even be bulldozed. What is increasingly hard to accept is that its fate should remain in the hands of Lord Falconer.</p>",

  "Jack Straw said this week that victims of crime or their relatives would be able to lay complaints under the new Human Rights Act if there was evidence police had failed to carry out a proper investigation of a crime. He said of the act, due to come into force on October 2: \"It is about the rights of victims and the wider community\". <p>But the home secretary is also considering giving victims a greater role in the judicial process. He has suggested that the court could be provided with a \"victim personal statement\". He is rightly sympathetic to the feelings of those who feel ignored in a process which directly affects them, but careful distinctions must be drawn. Helping victims by way of counselling or compensation is vital and doubtless much could be done to improve the support they receive; but the prosecution of the perpetrators of crime is another matter. </p> <p>Protestors in Portsmouth who believe their children to be the target of child abusers have every right to air their views publicly but they have no role in the court's function of deciding guilt, innocence or punishment. Centuries have gone by since catching criminals was left largely to victims and their families. Punishment was seen as making reparation to the victim. In modern society, while reparation may still have its place, maintaining the rule of law has become the responsibility of the state. The whole process has become professionalised. </p> <p>Jack Straw is certainly entitled to consider whether the pendulum has swung too far. Occasionally, reminders of the medieval rights of the victims have surfaced. In 1817, Abraham Thornton was tried by judge and jury for the rape and murder of Mary Ashford. They had been to a dance in the rural neigbourhood of Erdington, now a suburb of Birmingham, and they walked home together. Next morning Mary's violated body was found drowned in a pond. There were signs of a bloody struggle nearby. Abraham was the obvious suspect. </p> <p>He claimed they had intercourse by agreement and then parted peacefully. He denied any involvement in her death. In the days before fingerprints, blood tests or DNA, the means of proof were lacking. The judge pointed out that there was no evidence to link the accused directly with the crime. The jury acquitted. In their grief, Mary's family tried to use an archaic legal procedure, \"appeal of felony\", to have Thornton re-arrested and brought before the Court of Queen's Bench. Thornton's lawyer arrived at court with a large pair of gloves which he handed to his client. Those who have seen the recent production of Richard II would recognise what happened next. Thornton threw down his gauntlet in front of Mary's brother, William Ashford. </p> <p>Thornton claimed that the medieval law entitled him to trial by battle - the primitive idea was that winning a physical fight would prove who was right. Ashford refused the challenge - Thornton was younger and fitter. Ashford's lawyers argued that he should have a second jury trial but the judges said he had to fight or abandon his claim. Prudently he did so. The judges had rather effectively consigned the appeal of felony to the dustbin of history; it has never been attempted again. </p> <p>The victim's family has no longer the right to challenge an acquittal. And why should the accused, who has stood trial and been acquitted, have to face another trial merely because the victim is unhappy at the outcome? Where a suspect has not been tried and acquitted and the the Crown Prosecution Service declines to prosecute, there remains the possibility of a private prosecution, but, as the family of Stephen Lawrence discovered, it has pitfalls. </p> <p>The high standard of proof of guilt of crime must be achieved, yet the state's investigative resources are not available to the private person. As the Lawrences discovered to their dismay, an acquittal rules out a future public prosecution (though this could be changed following the recommendations of the Lawrence inquiry). </p> <p>The Human Rights Act is opening up promising opportunities for victims of crime to put greater pressure on the police and prosecuting auhorities to take action. The right to a fair hearing enshrined in the European Human Rights Convention has already been held by the Court of Human Rights to entitle the victim of crime to demand a thorough investigation and hold the police accountable if it is not carried out. From next month the English courts will have to enforce this requirement; the Scottish courts already have to do so. It is also important to remember that the victim has the right to take civil proceedings for compensation but this has little value where the criminal has no means or they are effectively concealed. </p> <p>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board may provide more certain recompense but there are features of that system which may themselves fall foul of the Human Rights Act. Jack Straw is right to try to improve remedies for victims but, other than as a witness of fact, the victim has no proper voice at the trial of the alleged perpetrator. To give the victim a role in deciding innocence or guilt would flout our notion of impartial and independent justice. It would violate the right of the accused to a fair trial. To give the victim any right to influence the sentence would raise the same fair trial issue.</p> <p>Within the criminal process itself the victim or the family may be able to contribute something to the sentencing process by providing information which will assist the judge. To this extent a \"victim personal statement\" may be of value. Beyond that, sympathy for the victim cannot in modern days detract from the state's responsibility to ensure the independence and impartiality of the justice system. </p> <p>\u0095 Geoffrey Bindman is a solicitor<br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hoffice/rights/rights.htm\" target=\"_new\">Rights Brought Home: the Human Rights Bill (White Paper)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/hract/hramenu.htm\" target=\"_new\">Home Office Human Rights Unit</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/hract/hrafaqs.htm\" target=\"_new\">Human Rights Act FAQ</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm\" target=\"_new\">Full text of Human Rights Act</a></p>",
  "<p>Every night in the city of Prague, up to 170 passengers squeeze on to a converted barge named the Secret. Crew members take them through an aeroplane-style safety drill, complete with life-vests and polystyrene floats, as the boat sets off along the Vltava river, accompanied by a Hungarian Gypsy band. The light fades; gnats dance in the boat's headlights. </p> <p>This is not the Czech answer to the bteau-mouche, but rather the latest venture by Petr and Matej Forman, the identical twin sons of film director Milos Foreman. Petr calls it the Czech Millennium Dome. The pair have ploughed almost \u00a3130,000 of their own cash into this floating theatre with its all-singing, all-dancing puppet play, Secrets of the Crimson Sails - and so far they are losing money. </p> <p>As the boat slides past the trams, the cubist villas and the soaring TV tower, a complex production unravels on the revolving stage: human actors cavort as floppy drunks, virtually indistinguishable from the life-size puppets with which they share the limelight; toy boats zoom over the audience's heads; merchants appear on stilts, unravelling multi-coloured silks that envelop the stage; and then, most enchanting of all, the stained-glass table tops in the stalls light up to reveal tiny doll's house-size scenes. </p> <p>Written by the Russian storyteller Alexander Grin, this is the tale of Assol, a poor sailor's daughter convinced that one day a handsome prince will whisk her away on a ship with crimson sails. \"It's about the fact that real life can also be like a fairytale, and that people can make miracles happen for others,\" says Petr. He and Matej say that after this project they know all about miracle-making. \"Everyone said the project was mad from the outset,\" says Petr. \"Even our dad said we'd bitten off more than we could chew.\" </p> <p>The tale of the show's tortuous birth encompasses all the nightmares one might expect to face in a bureaucratic, cash-strapped and land-locked country. When the brothers came across an old communist-era barge rusting in a boat yard last year, they approached the ministry of transport with plans to turn it into a theatre boat, only to be confronted with unending lists of conditions. Now they are convinced they know enough about boats to qualify as waterways engineers. </p> <p>Next came attempts to convince the culture ministry that the project was worth supporting. They had a chance to get their hands on extra cash because of Prague's status as a European City of Culture - but only if they could fight their way through Kafkaesque bureaucracy. </p> <p>Carpenters, construction workers and craftspeople worked for months on the conversion, earning as little as 300 crowns (\u00a35.50) a day. Once the boat was completed, the 22-strong team had become so involved the Formans couldn't bear to let them go. \"They were an integral part of it, so we employed all of them as actors,\" says Petr. Apart from the twins, there are only three professional actors involved. </p> <p>Petr and Matej attribute their remarkable achievement to the fact that they are twins. \"We've got something that many people try and fail to find all their lives,\" says Petr. \"I trust my brother 100% and we have a natural communication that helps the creative process and enables us to do crazy things.\" Indeed, so united are their thought processes that they initially insist that there's no point in my speaking to both of them. </p> <p>The brothers, who live on separate floors of the same Prague house, bought for them by their father, stress that they are not alone in their latest venture. They are co-operating with the French cabaret theatre Dromesko and the Theatre National de Bretagne. After Prague, they plan to visit Hamburg, Dresden, Strasbourg, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Nancy. And they are keen to find backers in London to help them negotiate the Thames. </p> <p>Animation and skilful puppetry are traditions strongly associated with Bohemia. Under the Hapsburg empire, the Czech language was squeezed off the mainstream stage in favour of German, but was allowed to survive in puppet theatre. Under communism, the authorities considered puppetry mere child's play, so it was allowed to thrive almost unsupervised, giving directors the freedom to create some fascinating subversive productions. </p> <p>Petr Forman graduated from Prague's puppet school in 1987, and Matej studied as an animation illustrator at the academy of fine arts. They started out as film actors, using their father's name to promote their double act. But after their first puppet show, for which they built a portable barn, they became popular in their own right. </p> <p>Born in 1964, the twins were the product of Milos Forman's second marriage, to Vera Kresadlova. Four years later, their father left Czechoslovakia for the US. Now he is hovering proudly in the background. \"He came to see the boat a month before the premiere,\" says Petr. \"He was at the Berlin film festival catching the Golden Bear award for The Man on the Moon, and he rented a car to pop over the border, sleeping in our caravan on the river's edge.\" Since then he has telephoned every day. </p> <p>Despite their father's financial and moral support, and the fact that Crimson Sails is playing to a packed boat every night, the money is running out. Each performance loses them around 65,000 crowns (\u00a31,200), and the musicians have to be paid from the proceeds of the boat's bar. \"We'll soon have to go begging to the ministry again,\" they say in unison.

  "Australia knew in advance of the 1975 Indonesian invasion of East Timor and stood by for three days while Jakarta's troops prepared for the attack, secret documents released yesterday by the government revealed. <p>Memos, cables and letters sent and received by Australia's foreign department between 1974 and 1976 confirmed that Australia gave tacit approval to Jakarta to annex the former Portuguese colony. </p> <p>East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence last year and is under temporary United Nations control after the referendum triggered a wave of violence by pro-Jakarta militias. </p> <p>Australia's foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, said the release of the documents ahead of the usual 30-year wait would help to clear the air over what is considered one of the most controversial events in Australian history. </p> <p>The papers show that Australia's embassy in Jakarta received full details from Indonesia of the timing of an attack on the Timorese town of Balibo in October 1975 - three days before it occurred. </p> <p>Five Australian journalists were killed in the assault. </p> <p>Mr Downer said that although the Labour government of Gough Whitlam had advance warning of the attack, there was no evidence that Australia could have prevented the journalists' deaths. </p> <p>\"The Department of Foreign Affairs had no information beforehand of any intentions to kill the journalists, although it did have prior knowledge of the planned invasion,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm not today, with 25 years of hindsight, going to pass judgment on the actions of Australian ministers and officials during this critical exercise, nor will I offer opinions about the conduct of other governments at the time.\" </p> <p>Australia's two main political parties have come under fire for their actions at the time. Mr Whitlam's Labour party was in office when Indonesia's then president Suharto ordered the invasion, and Malcolm Fraser's Liberal/National coalition was in power by the time Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976. </p> <p>Cabinet minutes from the time will not be released until the 30-year waiting period is up, and Mr Downer said intelligence reports might never be released for reasons of national security. </p> <p>Australia was the only western nation to recognise Indonesia's rule over East Timor. </p> <p>Human rights groups said up to 200,000 people died during the invasion and subsequent fighting and famine in East Timor, sparked by Portugal's withdrawal in 1975. </p> <p>Indonesia and its western allies reacted to the withdrawal with alarm, fearing that pro-communist East Timorese were taking over and that another communist stronghold would emerge in the region, months after the fall of Saigon to the communists. </p> <p>President Suharto also had tacit US support for the invasion, which took place just after a visit by the then president, Gerald Ford. </p> <p>With Vietnam fresh in mind, Australia told Jakarta it did not want to get involved in East Timor - a territory it had once called \"an essay in the hopeless\". Critics said this gave President Suharto a green light to invade. </p> <p>\"While preferring the integration of Portuguese Timor with Indonesia, the Whitlam government wished there to be a genuine act of self-determination in the territory,\" Mr Downer said. </p> <p>\"Fears that Indonesia might seek to obtain the territory otherwise than by these means led the Whitlam government to adopt a policy of studied detachment.\" </p> <p><br>Reuters</p>",
  "<p>An attack of the technicals was about the best explanation for the strong performance of London's three blue chip pharmaceutical stocks yesterday. </p> <p> <strong> AstraZeneca</strong> advanced 115p to \u00a333.00 - a new closing high - while <strong> Glaxo Wellcome</strong> added 65p to \u00a319.75 and <strong> SmithKline Beecham</strong> rose 29.5p to 893p. </p> <p>Certainly, there was some positive background music for the sector. There was some defensive buying as the fuel crisis deepened and AstraZeneca announced higher than expected British wholesale orders for Nexium, its successor to Losec, the world's biggest selling drug. There were even some wild rumours that Franco-German group <strong> Aventis</strong> was in merger talks. </p> <p>All of this, however, was a sideshow, the real explanation for the moves was much more mundane. </p> <p>On the one hand there was the level of the dollar against the pound, which fell below $1.40 for the first time in 14 years. SmithKline and Glaxo make the bulk of their profits in the US and bring them back to Britain. A strong dollar tends, therefore, to flatter profits. </p> <p>On the other hand, there was news of some important index changes. From next Monday, the companies which make up the widely followed Dow Jones STOXX family of blue chip indices will be selected on the size of their free float (the number of share freely tradable) rather than on market capitalisation. </p> <p>The implications of the move could be significant. According to one estimate there is \u20ac50bn (\u00a329bn) of institutional cash tracking the Euro STOXX 50 index and \u20ac10bn following the STOXX 50 index. </p> <p>One consequence of the index rebalancing is that AstraZeneca will be joining the STOXX 50. This means funds which track the index will need to buy more than 4m AstraZeneca shares by the close of play on Friday. Another is that Glaxo and SmithKline will see their weightings increased in the STOXX 50 index and trackers will be forced to buy 1m and 1.6m shares respectively by Friday. </p> <p>Although these changes have been flagged well in advance, dealers said, it was buying by the trackers that really pushed the trio higher. </p> <p>Other leading shares, meanwhile, ended lower as investors decided to ignore an early rebound for tech stocks on Wall Street and concentrate on events closer to home. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 closed down 26.5 points at 6,555.5 as investors started to worry about the impact the fuel crisis. The FTSE 250 fell 46.4 to 6,907.7 and the Techmark dipped 26.07 to 3,964.57. </p> <p>As the fuel crisis worsened, with some City wags labelling it the \"Autumn of Discontent\", transport stocks came under pressure. Logistics group <strong>Exel</strong> was one of the worst affected, falling 70p to \u00a310.10, while <strong>P&amp;O</strong> eased 25p to 580p. The misery was not just confined to the blue chips. FTSE 250 logistics group <strong> Tibbet &amp; Britten</strong> slipped 27.5p to 715p, while <strong> Securicor</strong> shed 9p to 124p and <strong> National Express</strong> closed down 30p at 765p. </p> <p>Oil groups <strong> BP</strong> and <strong> Shell</strong> were also weaker, falling 6p to 665p and 8.5p to 618.5p respectively. </p> <p>In sharp contrast to the rest of the media sector, which had a thoroughly miserable day with big declines for <strong> WPP</strong>, down 57p to 910p and <strong> EMI</strong>, 30p lower at 550p, news and information group <strong> Reuters</strong> moved higher. Its shares rose 12p to \u00a313.56 lifted by a report from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which claimed that trading remains strong. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate scale, <strong> Recognition Systems</strong>, the credit card fraud group, moved 18.5p higher to 410p. The buying came ahead of a dinner organised by broker Investec Henderson Crosthwaite at Claridge's last night. Apparently 12 heavyweight institutions were invited to the hear background on the company's investment propositions . </p> <p> <strong> Brunel Holdings</strong> gave back some of its recent gains, losing 1.25p, or 27.78%, to 3.25p.</p>",

  "Local authorities are to be urged by the government to use children, working under cover, to trap newsagents and shopkeepers who sell cigarettes to those under 16, and provide evidence which can be used in court. <p>The strategy is part of a government crackdown on under-age smoking. Ministers want trading standards officers to come down hard on retailers selling cigarettes to children. Today, the Department of Health, and the Department of Trade and Industry, launched a code - the tobacco enforcement protocol - outlining approaches proven to work. </p> <p>Child sleuths are already used in some areas. In Kingston, Surrey, a girl aged 13 helped trading standards officers establish the extent of the problem in 1990 when 45% of local shopkeepers were found to be willing to sell her cigarettes. A series of high-profile prosecutions since then has reduced the number selling to children; by 1995, only 10% were agreeing to sell tobacco to the child volunteers. </p> <p>Although the use of children for entrapment purposes is controversial, ministers have accepted that it may be the only way to gather proof that will stand up in court. Yvette Cooper, minister for public health, said: \"Any action that can be taken to stop harmful tobacco products falling in to the hands of children will reduce the chances of [their] becoming smokers.\" </p> <p>Kim Howells, DTI minister for consumer protection, said: \"Local trading standards officers will now be able to use these guidelines to come down hard on retailers who are breaking the law.\" </p> <p>The government wants to cut the number of child smokers, which has risen from 8% of 11- to 15-year-olds in 1988, to about 11% in 1998. Girls in this age group are most likely to smoke; nearly one in three were smoking regularly two years ago.The government has pledged, by 2010, to cut smoking among children from 13% to 9% or less. </p> <p>The code has been agreed with the local authorities' co-ordinating body on food and trading standards, and the Local Government Association, and says retailers should be urged to adopt a \"no proof, no sale\" policy. There are a number of safeguards. The children used must not be given inducements, they must operate in an area where they are not known, and they must be followed the entire time. </p> <p>Ted Forsyth, head of trading standards in Kingston, said: \"We have to be sure that the child is happy and not doing it just because of a pushy parent. We ensure they are instructed always to tell the truth and they are not allowed to wear makeup or jewellery or dress to look older.\" </p> <p>In Kingston, children are also used to check whether retailers are selling other goods to under-age children, such as butane lighter fuel, a solvent that can kill.</p>",
  "In the oppressive heat of Pakistan's North West Frontier hundreds of young boys huddle together on the floor around a handful of electric fans, rocking backwards and forwards as they memorise verses from the Koran. <p>This is a normal school day for these children just as it was for their fathers and their fathers' fathers for centuries before. Many of those former pupils went on to fight with the mojahedin against the Soviet forces in Afghanistan and are now fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir. Others are among the top leaders of Afghanistan's repressive Taliban militia. </p> <p>Pakistan's military regime, under pressure from the west to curb terror groups, wants to modernise teaching in these Islamic schools. But the military is risking a confrontation with the increasingly influential religious right. </p> <p>\"The government can do nothing,\" said Sami-ul Haq, the hardline cleric who runs this madrassah, the Darul Uloom Haqqani, one of the leading Islamic seminaries in Asia. </p> <p>\"The United States wants to be the supreme power in the world and it knows that these madrassahs are the hurdles in its way so they put pressure on the government,\" said Mr Haq. </p> <p>\"But the madrassah is not just the building. If a teacher stands under the shade of a tree with his students that is a madrassah . If the United States closes down one madrassah we will build thousands more under every tree.\" </p> <p>Mr Haq stroked his long, hennaed beard and reflected proudly on some of his star students now leading the Afghan Taliban. They include the interior minister, Khairula Khairkhwa, and the head of the feared religious police, Qalam Uddin. </p> <p>After 53 years of military rule and corrupt democracy Pakistan was now ready to become an Islamic state like neighbouring Afghanistan, he said. </p> <p>Few Pakistanis, however, voted for the religious parties when they had the chance. The clerics' power has always lain in the fear that they might bring students from the thousands of madrassahs out on to the streets. </p> <p>It was the religious leaders' opposition that forced Pakistan's leader, General Pervez Musharraf, to back down this year on his proposal to make a slight procedural change to the country's blasphemy law. The law is often misused to target religious minorities, particularly Christians. </p> <p>Then the religious parties backed shopkeepers in their opposition to a new income survey and the introduction of a new sales tax. Clerics want the weekly holiday switched back from Sunday to Friday. </p> <p>Now the government has provoked their anger again by trying to survey the madrassahs and introduce new classes, like science and computing. </p> <p>\"Our main objective is that the ulema (clerics) should join the mainstream and make some positive contribution to society,\" said Mehmood Amed Ghazi, the member of Gen Musharraf's national security council who is in charge of the madrassah issue. </p> <p>Gen Musharraf has met several religious leaders in the past month, including Mr Haq. He is reportedly planning to bring some of them, along with some former politicians, into his government as advisers. </p> <p>Mr Haq is at pains to point out that his madrassah is no threat. It has no weapons and no military training. \"You see, there is no terrorism in the madrassahs ,\" he said. But the thoughts of war in Kashmir and Afghanistan are not far from the minds of his young students. </p> <p>\"There is a vast difference between an Islamic war, which is a jihad, and terrorism,\" said Arshad Yusuf, a 24-year-old in his sixth year at the Haqqani school. </p> <p>\"Jihad is to fight for a very great cause, like Kashmir. If there are people who restrict the Muslims, then the Muslims are allowed to fight them. People in the west should understand the spirit of Islam.\"</p>"
