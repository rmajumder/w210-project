  "<p>Ipswich Town and Wimbledon were embroiled in a row over the future of Hermann Hreidarsson last night, with Ipswich claiming to have bought the defender for a club-record \u00a34m and Wimbledon insisting they had not even agreed a fee for the sale. The south London club, meanwhile, are lining up Everton's Richard Dunne as a possible replacement. </p> <p>Ipswich announced yesterday that the 26-year-old Iceland centre-half would join at the end of the week subject to a medical. </p> <p>The Premiership club said their chairman David Sheepshanks and Wimbledon's chief executive David Barnard had agreed a fee on Saturday by telephone and that personal terms had been settled with the player on Sunday before he flew to Iceland for tomorrow's friendly against Sweden. </p> <p>\"We are delighted that we have got a proven international player to boost our defence,\" said Sheepshanks, who negotiated Hreidarsson's contract along with the Ipswich manager George Burley. </p> <p>Within hours, though, Barnard accused Ipswich of jumping the gun. \"We have not yet accepted the offer they have made,\" he insisted. \"They made an original bid which we rejected as unsatisfactory. They have since made a second offer, which we are now considering. </p> <p>\"Nothing can be done until Hermann returns [on Thursday] and I can tell you from experience that a week in football is a very long time indeed; anything can happen.\" </p> <p>Despite Barnard's retort, Ipswich said they expected Hreidarsson to sign before their opening game at Tottenham on Saturday. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Everton manager Walter Smith yesterday told Wimbledon that \u00a32.5m would secure Dunne's services. The centre-back is expected to travel to London today to discuss personal terms. </p> <p>Smith will use his windfall to fund his bid for the Newcastle United striker Duncan Ferguson, who is poised to return to Everton less than two years after departing for Tyneside in an \u00a38m deal. The former Scotland international is arguing with Newcastle over loyalty bonuses but is expected to undergo a medical today. </p> <p>Everton have agreed an initial \u00a33.75m fee plus an additional \u00a31m when - or if - he features in 60 senior games. </p> <p>Charlton have snapped up the Iran international Karim Bagheri from the Iranian club Piroozi for \u00a3400,000, potentially rising to \u00a31.1m. As an attacking midfielder the 26-year-old scored 20 goals in qualifying for France 98, but can also operate as a sweeper. </p> <p>Bradford City hope to complete the \u00a31.5m signing of the Blackburn striker Ashley Ward in time for their opener at Liverpool on Saturday. </p> <p>The Cardiff City striker Dai Thomas has been fined the maximum two weeks' wages for his part in the Euro 2000 riots. The 24-year-old was caught on camera as hundreds of supporters ran riot in Brussels before an England game. </p> <p>\"This is as near as we have come to letting a player go for non-playing matters,\" said Cardiff's chairman Steve Borley. \"Clearly, his full apology went a long way towards our decisions.\" </p> <p>Barcelona will take their summer spending to \u00a348.5m today when the Spain striker Alfonso completes an \u00a38m move from Real Betis.</p>",
  "<p>No matter what embarrassments Joe Royle and City suffer on the opening day of the Premiership against Charlton, Manchester will not be turning pink this Saturday evening - nor any other Saturday. The Pink is dead. Long live the Sunday Pink. </p> <p>For decades the Football Pink Final of the Manchester Evening News has faithfully charted the ups and downs of the Blues and Reds and in its heyday, when websites were found only on the fringes of park ponds and Saturday night television reporting meant a talking head, The Pink was mandatory reading. </p> <p>Students leaving the city for far-flung universities, polytechnics or teaching colleges demanded their mothers parcel up The Pink and send it on so that nothing was missed. Up to last weekend it was an institution, its glory faded but still much loved and cherished. </p> <p>Now it is gone, buried a week before a particularly titillating season, with both City and United in the Premiership. It is bizarre timing. </p> <p>And, even though the soccer fanatics of Greater Manchester have been promised a \"fantastic new-look Sunday Pink\", it will never be the same. For Saturday Pinks or Greens or Blues and occasionally Buffs are dangerous animals, produced on a tightrope, with the thrill of the chase from reporter to printing press to shop counter or street corner redolent of thinly disguised panic. </p> <p>The first place to look is always the late scorers column, for a front-page headline proclaiming \"Tense struggle for United\" might disguise an 87th-, 88th- and 90th-minute hat-trick. </p> <p>Football Finals are a modern marvel, with match reports reaching the public not much more than an hour after the final whistle. Ceefax and the internet may have bruised the magic but a warm Pink 'Un after one's team has won is as lingeringly loving as any other Saturday night caress. </p> <p>My footballing youth did not include away matches, which made the rush for the Football Final all the more memorable. The Grimsby Evening Telegraph always included on its front page a simple, child-like representation of a face whose mouth was upturned for a win, down-turned for a defeat and in a straight line for a draw. I can still feel that lurch of the stomach when the mouth signified the Mariners had sunk. </p> <p> For close to 40 years David Meek revelled in the challenge of writing his Manchester United match reports for The Pink. \"It wasn't exactly an exercise in quality writing but it was the most exciting part of the week for me.\" </p> <p>And he remembers how Tom Henry, a football-daft former MEN editor, would check the front page of The Pink and often rewrite the headline. One painful afternoon at St James' Park, after United had been thrashed 6-1, he came up with: \"United lose seven-goal thriller\". </p> <p>This may not quite match the Dundee Evening Telegraph's blazing \"Broughty ferryman dies in sea tragedy\", run with a smaller, subsidiary headline: \"Titanic Sunk In Maiden Voyage\", but it underlines the wonderfully one-eyed nature of football pinks. </p> <p>The new MEN Sunday Pink promises \"more in-depth match analysis\". Meek takes umbrage. \"Our match reports were entirely our own thoughts and not influenced by what the managers might say later, or the players.\" </p> <p>The story is told of an elderly MEN news editor who, as a boy, was sent to Old Trafford on a Saturday to attach the reporter's match report to the legs of homing pigeons and despatch them to the office a few miles away. </p> <p>To stop the birds flapping he clamped their wings with elastic bands. After attaching the first couple of paragraphs he rushed to the back of the stand and released the pigeon with a steady throw. Splat! He had forgotten to remove the elastic. This Saturday it would not have mattered.</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore believes the threatened abolition of the transfer system would hit England harder than any other nation. </p> <p>Officials from Fifa, Uefa and all Europe's football associations are desperately trying to protect the traditional transfer market, which is under investigation by the European Union, who could decree it illegal, possibly by the end of the year. </p> <p>Yesterday Fifa, the sport's world governing body, said this week it was sending the EU proposals that could avoid some of the most feared consequences of abolition. </p> <p>After analysing the Perugia case, in which the Italian club refused to pay a fee for a player signed while he was still under contract in Belgium, the EU is set to challenge the requirement of compensation for contracted players changing clubs. </p> <p>EU officials believe the transfer system may infringe workers' right of free movement under its employment law. </p> <p>Fifa's general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen has already predicted \"the end of football\" should a workable solution not be found. </p> <p>Although Scudamore does not make such a stark assessment, he left little doubt about the Premier League's concern. </p> <p>\"It is the number one issue in the game just now,\" he said. \"It is top of our agenda because it would affect us more than any other country. </p> <p>\"The depth of professional football is greater in England than anywhere else in Europe. If the transfer market collapses it would affect 30 clubs in France and 40 in Spain. Here, you are talking about 92 and even some beyond that.\" </p> <p>The consequences of abolition would be that players could move clubs at will, without cost to the buyer, and with a minimum amount of notice. </p> <p>Scudamore added: \"One of the fundamental principles of the game is that you have to be able to build a team. There must be a mutual agreement between a player and club for a contract to be ended. You can't have a system where someone signs an agreement then says, 'I'm off tomorrow'.\"</p>",
  "<p>Twenty years ago this month, Nicolas Roeg's Bad Timing was briefly and reluctantly released into the community, its own distributor, Rank, condemning it as \"a sick film made by sick people for sick people\". Roeg, then 52, was the visionary firebrand of British cinema, a great underground artist in full flow after the dizzyingly edited mosaics of four earlier works - Performance (1970), Walkabout (1970), Don't Look Now (1973) and The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). </p> <p>He was used to controversy and the repulsion of financiers. Warner Brothers had suppressed Performance for two years and wanted to sue him for unprofessional conduct after viewing its disorienting gender meltdown. But the reaction to Bad Timing was something else. \"Sick... sick... sick,\" said the man from Rank. And it has stayed buried ever since, like a guilty secret. It has never been re-released. It hasn't been available on video for many years - almost uniquely for work from such a major director. </p> <p>Bad Timing barely has a plot. It only really has four characters: psychology professor Alex (Art Garfunkel), his lover Milena (Theresa Russell), her husband Stefan (Denholm Elliott) and Austrian detective Netusil (Harvey Keitel), who interrogates Alex after Milena's attempted suicide. </p> <p>All that really happens is that Roeg unravels the strands trapping two people in love. Flashbacks show Garfunkel - poised, repressed, a professional voyeur who lends his expertise to Nato military intelligence - and Russell, a chaotic force who needs to be free, dragging each other to breakdown in Vienna, while in the film's present Keitel leads Garfunkel toward the memory of what he really did in the hours before the drugged Russell reached hospital: he raped her unconscious body. Scenes of Russell during orgasm and tracheotomy are spliced with surgical flicks of Roeg's editing knife. Keitel probes into Garfunkel's head; Garfunkel and Russell mangle each other's. </p> <p>\"Did you pirate it?\" Roeg asks when we meet to discuss it. \"I like pirate copies. There are some around.\" Bad Timing began with a favourite Italian paperback of the producer Carlo Ponti, a story of sexual obsession that neither Roeg nor his screenwriter, Yale Udoff, read. Its premise proved a gift. \"It was all about frailties,\" Roeg says. \"It was about the fact that you cannot intellectualise your genes, which make aspects of your life inevitable. You cannot intellectualise yourself out of obsession. You cannot cure yourself of it.\" </p> <p>Vienna in 1979 impregnated their work. \"It was an unstable city, a border city, only just handed back from the Russians. To be in a place with so many strange rules and so many dangers, so many police and spies - all that was in the film.\" </p> <p>Next, Roeg mixed the acting elements that would combust in this border zone. Keitel, as the detective who investigates the truth so hard that at one point he seems to hallucinate the facts, and Elliott, beginning a decade of despairingly noble roles as Russell's wry cuckold, were perfect. But it was Garfunkel, with only Mike Nichols's Carnal Knowledge to recommend him, and Russell, a 21-year-old ingenue, who were plunged into Bad Timing's heart. Garfunkel was chosen because Roeg heard he'd once been a mathematician as well as a singer: \"a man of the world, of ideas and connections\". Russell, too, \"wasn't caught up in theatricality, being a star\". </p> <p>Four days into the shoot his two tyro stars begged Roeg to let them leave, and he knew he was on the right track. \"Theresa came first. She said, 'I don't think I'm up to this. I'm terribly nervous. Please let me leave.' I said, 'No. I won't let you. I'm glad you feel that way.' Then I asked Art in. I told them, 'This isn't like another movie. We're shooting fragments of scenes; there's nothing to rehearse. We're in a city none of us knows, an empty landscape. I must ask you to trust that I know where I'm going. It's a maze, but there is an end to it.' We had some Martinis, and they agreed. Somehow, it was a release. I felt all right about pushing them further and further.\" </p> <p>One of the many emotional scatterbombs stumbled over was that Roeg and Russell fell in love (they later married). I wonder if the fearless chaos of her performance is what he fell for. \"When you admire someone's work, you are amazed by who you think they are,\" he says. \"But their real secret is masonic: they keep it right to the end. Very few people are prepared to let you all the way in - to Kafka's 'point of no return'. We went very far. As it turned out, not all the way. Theresa knew it was too dangerous. That's all in the movie.\" </p> <p> It was worse for Garfunkel. Like his repressed character, he had little idea what was in store. \"As we worked, I think he recognised a truth in his character's obsession in himself,\" says Roeg. \"Then he had to decide whether to play it so people he knew would recognise it. It was like coming out. The actors were all nervous and guilty.\" </p> <p>The actors' immersion into their parts became painful. At the film's half-way point, when Russell vengefully demands sex with Garfunkel on the stairs, and he looks up at what's on offer like a naughty schoolboy, fearfully grabbing her, her skin mottling and flushing, the old claims that there was real penetration on the set of Performance seem small beer: here, psyches are stripped. And soon the fever spread through the crew. </p> <p>\"Everybody was peeling themselves open,\" Roeg remembers. \"It was a wild time, there was a great feeling of release - sexually, emotionally. It was exhilarating. I remember one day we shot for 24 hours. I think I was the one who said, 'I can't take it any more. I've had enough.' We were shooting six or seven days a week. It was claustrophobic - play the part, go to sleep, go back. I abandoned control, and something magical came in. Bad Timing began to live itself. I kept out of the way of its forcefield. It was a bit of suspended time. A parallel universe.\" </p> <p>Everyone caught their breath when Garfunkel and Russell's characters took a break in Morocco. Shooting on the edge of the Sahara, they felt free, adventurous. But it was the calm before the storm - the long day, back in Vienna, spent filming the rape. It looks deeply uncomfortable - Russell's head hanging back from her bed, while Garfunkel tears her clothes with a penknife, and enters her over and over. Shooting it was \"shocking\", Roeg remembers. 'The actors were frightened when they realised the disgust you feel when you can't control yourself. It's an extraordinary, horrible crime, rape. And you don't often see the rape of the unconscious. Usually it's someone dragged screaming into the bushes. There's a lot of acting going on. There wasn't a lot of acting in that scene.\" </p> <p>After a break, some of the crew reassembled for a final scene in New York. But Garfunkel's performance was distant. They'd left their parallel universe and couldn't go back. Roeg scrapped the scene. But he began post-production thrilled at the work they'd done, sure audiences would recognise the characters' emotions. </p> <p>But, Roeg recalls, \"it was received for the most part very poorly.\" At the first test screening in America, I was going to meet a friend, a quite well-known actor. Afterwards, he got into his car, drove it at me, and swerved off. He wouldn't speak to me for three years. I didn't realise till then how seriously people resent you holding a mirror to their face.\" </p> <p>Keitel and Garfunkel became firm friends from the experience. Roeg and Russell returned to Bad Timing's themes in other undervalued work such as Cold Heaven (1993), in which Russell's half-dead, cuckolded husband recovers from the surgeon's scalpel to test their love. </p> <p>The dashed dreams they all had for Bad Timing 20 years ago still bond them. \"When Rank called it 'sick', it hurt,\" Roeg says. \"I was surprised and upset for the actors. No matter how much I said they were terrific, they didn't get the recognition they patently deserved. It doesn't help much, years later, when people say, 'Oh, that movie...\"'</p>",
  "This is Northern Ireland's most dangerous part of the year, when politics cool down and paramilitary tempers heat up. The Protestant marching season doesn't help; nor do military republican efforts to show that they are \"protecting\" their community. This year the marches have mostly gone to peaceful plan, yet still the hard men are snarling at each other. <p>There has been a spate of tit-for-tat sectarian attacks in north and east Belfast, where loyalist and nationalist communities live cheek by jowl, and where the ugly steel and breeze block barriers which disfigured the city in the worst years of the troubles, have been dismantled with the outbreak of partial peace. </p> <p>It doesn't feel peaceful now in places like Ardoyne, an epicentre of sectarian clashes for 30 years. There and in other pockets of the city, families are once again packing their cases, hammering thick boards over their shattered windows, and moving to live with relatives in their tribal heartlands. </p> <p>The thugs are taking back control, and gunfire is once again heard in the dark of night. The loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) are threatening to rescind their ceasefire, unless the IRA reins in the attacks on Protestant families. The IRA isn't - yet - threatening to respond in kind, but republican hardliners are also battening on to the fear in the streets. </p> <p>Former UFF commander Johnny Adair, one of the hardest of the lot, claimed today that he was attacked by republicans with a pipe bomb. He said he was sitting in a car in the Ardoyne district when its windscreen was shattered by the blast. Adair was immediately accused of concocting the story, to stir up violence against Catholics. </p> <p>Sinn Fein Assembly member Gerry Kelly flatly denied that republicans were involved in the alleged bomb incident. Police said they had not been called to investigate. That's how it goes: claim and counterclaim, attack and counterattack, until someone says a word too many, or fires a shade too accurately. </p> <p>Just like in Omagh two years ago to the day, when members of the IRA planted a car bomb in the middle of a busy market town, and gave police the wrong location in their warning call. Twenty-nine lives were taken that day; sacrifices in the ancient rituals of hatred. </p> <p>There is no particular reason why the temperature should be rising this summer. There have been no great explosions of anger and, thank God, no real explosions of the Omagh kind. The same old frustrations are around, to be sure, just like the same rhetoric and politicians. </p> <p>The IRA has still not disarmed, and the RUC is still not reformed. But the peace is slowly taking hold, and the hard men are slowly being edged back to the periphery of day-to-day life, where they belong. That is why, from time to time, they do their best to revive their influence by doing what they know best: terrifying people. </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland\">Special report: Northern Ireland </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.com/cgi-bin/todaysnews\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a><br> <a href=\"http://scripts.ireland.com/tardis.plx?main=newspaper/front\" target=\"_new\">Irish Times</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.irishnews.com\" target=\"_new\">Irish News</a><br> </p>",
  "<p>Quality watchdogs have warned UK universities to tread carefully as they move into lucrative new markets for overseas students, in the aftermath of a report criticising the University of Derby for the poor standards of students enrolled on degree courses established in Israel.</p> <p>The Derby case is the latest of a small but damaging number of scandals where UK universities have been found to be mismanaging franchised operations abroad. </p> <p>Following the prime minister's calls for the UK to capture a larger share of the global higher education market, universities now have their sights set on large untapped student markets in China, India and Japan. </p> <p>But the chief executive of the Quality Assurance Agency for higher education, John Randall, has warned that institutions should be careful not to sacrifice standards in the rush to recruit fee-paying overseas students.</p> <p>\"There are a number of possible lucrative markets emerging,\" says Randall. \"But anyone who wants to operate in the market should do so properly and responsibly. If one institution gets it wrong it can blow the reputation for the whole of the UK academic community.\" </p> <p>Last year the prime minister unveiled bold new targets for UK universities to attract a quarter of the world's share of international students by 2005. International students represent one of the fastest-growing revenue streams for UK universities, bringing an estimated \u00a31.5bn annually into academic coffers. </p> <p>Since Derby restructured its operation following concerns raised by the Israeli higher education authorities, the running of the courses has greatly improved, says the QAA in its report published last week.</p> <p>But the investigators uncovered a number of disturbing instances suggesting poor quality control of the courses run in partnership with the Israeli Inter College. Some students could not speak English to the standards required for entry. At least one student graduated with a degree after only one year of study.</p> <p>In April 2000, there were some 6,400 students registered for University of Derby degrees at Inter College, which was set up in 1996 by three private Israeli education organisations to run the courses. </p> <p>\"The inquiry came to the general conclusion that the link with Inter College was established without sufficient care and prudence and, initially, was managed in a way that did not secure the quality and standards of the programmes offered,\" concluded the QAA report.</p> <p>Last year the QAA criticised the University of Hertfordshire over the quality of its franchised operations in Malaysia. </p> <p>A survey by the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals has revealed that universities are stepping up their international programmes in light of the prime minister's initiative. The priority countries for many institutions are China, India, Malaysia and Japan.</p>",
  "British Airways today suspended its Concorde operations with immediate effect after advice from regulatory authorities. <p>BA said it had taken action after being told that the aircraft's certificate of airworthiness was about to be suspended. </p> <p>The decision comes after last month's Air France Concorde crash near Paris, which killed 113 people. </p> <p>The BA chief executive, Rod Eddington, said: \"BA's first concern is always safety. All our aircraft are subject to continuing and exhaustive safety checks. </p> <p>\"We have been in constant contact with the airworthiness authorities in the UK and France, the airframe and engine manufacturers and Air France throughout Concorde's flying life, and particularly closely since the accident in Paris last month. </p> <p>\"Since then, we implemented an extensive series of additional procedures and checks on the aircraft's airframe, engines, tyres and wheels, hydraulics and other systems and operating procedures, above and beyond Concorde's already demanding schedule of maintenance, inspections and operation parameters. </p> <p>\"The British CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] was in complete agreement with our decision to resume Concorde's services shortly after the Air France crash. </p> <p>\"We were notified this morning by the AAIB [air accident investigation branch] that, in the light of latest information available to it, it and its French counterparts, the BEA, would tomorrow recommend that the certificate of airworthiness for the aircraft should be suspended. </p> <p>\"We discussed this with the CAA and we understand that it would be minded to accept this advice. As soon as we heard this, we immediately withdrew our supersonic fleet from service this morning.\"</p> <p>He said BA had cancelled its Concorde service BA001 which was about to depart for New York. Passengers on that flight and on the return BA002 from JFK were being transferred to alternative services.</p> <p>Passengers flying from Heathrow airport Terminal Four today greeted the decision to suspend all Concorde flights with mixed feelings. </p> <p>Andy Young, a 35-year-old chief financial officer flying to Cairo, who had previously flown by Concorde two years ago, said he was not surprised by the decision, believing that it would take a long time for Concorde to re-establish any kind of confidence with passengers. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't have gone on Concorde again after the crash in France,\" he said. </p> <p>It is not yet known exactly what was discovered by the AAIB and its French counterparts that would prompt BA to ground its supersonic fleet. </p> <p>But clearly the airline, despite all its checks and its confidence in the plane in the immediate aftermath of the crash, is now concerned enough to have made today's decision.</p> <p>Today's announcement could put an end to supersonic passenger travel, almost three decades after the Anglo-French project which developed what became the world's most famous aeroplane. </p> <p>The safety of British Airways' Concorde fleet has come under intense scrutiny in the weeks following last month's horrific Paris crash. </p> <p>Fears about the supersonic jet's airworthiness were fuelled by four worrying incidents aboard BA planes shortly after the tragedy. </p> <p>There were also concerns just days before the crash when tiny cracks were found in the wings of the aircraft - which had previously suffered no fatal accidents in 25 years' flying. </p> <p>One was taken out of service after the cracks in the rear wing spar grew from 60mm to 76mm in length, while the remaining six aircraft were ruled fit to fly. </p> <p>But in the aftermath of the crash at Gonesse the probe has largely focused on the aircraft's high-pressure tyres. French investigators believe the \"initial cause\" of the Air France accident on July 25 was a metal strip on the runway at Charles de Gaulle. </p> <p>It is thought it punctured a tyre, sending huge chunks of rubber into the area of the fuel tanks on the left-hand side of the plane. Jet fuel then poured out into the super-hot \"afterburner\" engine used for take-off, sending flames shooting from the back of the wing. </p> <p>Preliminary theories that a thrust reverser on one of the engines, which was repaired on the runway shortly before take off, were quickly dismissed. But it emerged after the crash that BA Concordes had suffered four \"potentially catastrophic\" blow-outs shortly after it came into service in the 1970s. </p> <p>One of the early incidents damaged an engine, punctured fuel tanks and left a large hole in the top of the wing. Records from the US National Transportation Safety Board show a number of incidents after burst tyres, with one particularly serious blow-out in June 1979 and three less dangerous ones over the next two years. </p> <p>Crucially, BA Concorde pilots have long complained about the problem on board their aircraft. The problem became so acute that BA installed an alarm system on the cramped Concorde flight deck to alert pilots when a tyre bursts. BA also installed special strengthened \"mud-catchers\" above the undercarriage to counter the risk of debris flying up and hitting the fuselage. Air France have not said if they installed similar devices. Former BA Concorde captain David Brister said he had been involved in an incident in 1982 but maintained the aircraft was \"very safe\". </p> <p>A burst tyre caused the brakes to catch fire during take-off but he managed to bring the plane to a safe stop on the runway, he said. But he warned that with two engines so close together on the aircraft, they were susceptible to being knocked out at the same time.</p> <p>Ken Smart, the AAIB's chief inspector, told PA News today that he would be explaining the latest development to the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. Asked what investigators had now found to prompt the safety recommendation, Mr Smart replied: \"The French authorities will be explaining this tomorrow.\" </p> <p>BA cancelled two Concorde services on the night of last month's crash but after extensive checks and discussions with all interested parties, decided to resume services the following day. </p> <p>Since then, the investigation into the tragedy has led to a number of official announcements, and plenty of unofficial theories, about the cause of the accident. </p> <p>Last week investigators said a strip of metal found on the runway where the jet took off probably punctured a Concorde tyre, turning the rubber and metal mix into shrapnel which damaged one or several fuel tanks on the left wing, causing a fuel leak and fire. </p> <p>Earlier, New Scientist magazine claimed to have seen details of the study which said that some of these could lead to \"catastrophic problems\" - including uncontrolled fire and multiple engine failure. </p> <p>The risk analysis of the supersonic jet's Olympus 593 engines was commissioned by British Airways two years ago. It was carried out in conjunction with Rolls-Royce, which built the engines, and BMT Reliability Consultants of Fareham, Hampshire. </p> <p>But BA insisted that the CAA had looked at the programme and the findings and did not find any need to demand action to improve the safety of the aircraft. </p> <p>Concorde has been one of the most rigorously tested planes in history and until last month's crash had never suffered a fatal crash.</p>",
  "<p>Breasts epitomise femininity. Firm, heaving bosoms have through the ages inspired men to awe and poetry, and remain potent symbols of sex, nurturing and motherhood. At least, this is what you might think if you were an advertising executive, a Sun reader, or a 19th century Austrian psychoanalyst. In fact, for millions of British women, the reality of breast ownership is very different. For many, their breasts are little more than a source of tortuous pain; inescapable repositories of fear, loathing, lumps and confusion. </p> <p>Breast pain affects two-thirds of women at some stage in their lives, and is often much more than a few days of premenstrual discomfort. For many, sport is impossible, even with the sturdiest of sports bras. They may even find it difficult to walk without their arms crossed over the chest. They may avoid hugging their children, dread sex and live in fear of an accidental knock. For 15%, it interferes with sleep. </p> <p>Disappointingly, little medical progress has been made in this field since Astley Cooper, one of the leading surgeons of the 1800s, announced that breast pain was \"the result of a nervous disposition\". </p> <p>Today, with nearly all research into mammary glands focusing on finding a cure for breast cancer, hardly any funds are earmarked for investigating breast pain. This may explain why there is no treatment available apart from paracetamol, evening primrose oil (how many other cripplingly painful conditions are treated with a vegetable oil?) or hormone treatments which can get rid of the pain but at the cost of gaining a deeper voice and facial hair. </p> <p>Denise Wellbeloved, from Cardiff, suffers pain for three weeks out of every four. \"There were times of the month when I just stayed home and cried,\" she says. \"The pain got so bad that some days I just had to lie in the bath for hours on end. It affected my work, my home life and my sex life. Sometimes I couldn't bear my husband to come near me.\" </p> <p>Denise was initially told it was \"perfectly normal for a woman to have pain in her breasts\". She now has it somewhat under control with high doses of evening primrose oil. Dr Eleanor Clarke, an adviser to the Breast Care Campaign, says: \"Unfortunately, there are still very many things we don't understand about benign breast disease.\" She adds that if it was a condition that affected men: \"We might well have got a lot further by now.\" </p> <p>The problem with breasts is that, more than any other organ, they are constantly changing. Age, stages of the month, pregnancy, weaning and menopause give rise to an alarming variety of lumps, bumps, pains and swellings, all of which can be normal. </p> <p>With confusion reigning even among the experts, it's hardly surprising that some women are too frightened even to approach a doctor, or to examine themselves every month, which is recommended. Even if they get to hospital and cancer is ruled out, they will be sent home, often still confused and worried about their inexplicable pain. </p> <p>\"So few women really know what normal is, that it can lead to a lot of unnecessary anxiety,\" says breast-care nurse Nikki West who works at the University of Wales college of medicine in Cardiff. She urges women to become more \"breast aware\", adding: \"Women should be giving their breasts the same care and attention as their face, hair and skin.\" </p> <p>Clarke says: \"The first thing that women with pain think of is cancer, and this fear is often magnified by the media. Appointments with consultants doubled in the fortnight after Linda McCartney died of breast cancer, and at present in the Radio 4 soap opera, The Archers, for example, there is a 32-year-old character with breast cancer. The chances of a woman that young really getting cancer are tiny.\" </p> <p>The fear factor is well illustrated by a survey Clarke carried out at her own surgery in Chorley Wood, Hertfordshire. \"I saw 137 women in one year who were concerned about their breasts,\" she says. \"Sixty per cent of them had pain but, in the end, only one had cancer. Pain alone is a very uncommon symptom of cancer.\" </p> <p>Breast pain, nearly always benign, can be cyclical or non-cyclical. Cyclical pain is by far the most common, and is thought to be caused by an abnormal sensitivity of the breast tissue to normal levels of hormones, which build up the milk-producing tissue each month after ovulation, and then fall rapidly when the period starts. This sensitivity is linked to low levels of a fatty acid called gamolenic acid (GLA), which governs the body's responses to its own hormones. Levels are rarely low because of any dietary deficiency, but due to inefficient conversion processes in the body. Non-cyclical pain is often more worrying. Constant pain, usually described as burning, pricking or stabbing - especially if it is in only one breast or in a woman over 35 - can unsurprisingly give rise to fear, sometimes more debilitating than the pain itself. It is most likely, however, to be caused by a cyst, bad posture, or strain or injury of the ribs or muscles of the chest wall. </p> <p>Ill-fitting bras could be another cause. According to Marks &amp; Spencer, up to 60% of British women are wearing the wrong size bra. Women often continue to buy the same size throughout their lives, even though the shape and size of their breasts can change significantly. Either kind of pain can start at any time, and can be just as bad in totally flat-chested women as in a size 44DD. Clarke says: \"It seems to start often in the 20s and 30s, and could be to do with weight or lifestyle change, or having babies.\" </p> <p>She says it may also be linked to eating fatty foods, caffeine and stress - although pain afflicts plenty of yogically calm vegetarians who never touch coffee or Coca-Cola. Cruelly, chocolate, most women's solution to PMS, may also be a cause. </p> <p>The best treatment for benign breast pain is evening primrose oil, which can help in up to 70% of women. However, the amounts in health food supplements (around 15mg) are nowhere near enough to have any effect. Large quantities are needed - around 320mg per day - and these are available only in prescription preparations such as Efamast and Epogam. Further, it must be taken for at least three months before it has any benefit. After this time, the supplements often seem to help the body \"click back\" to normal, with the pain disappearing and no need for further supplements. </p> <p>The other treatments are synthetic \"anti-hormones\", which work quickly - but can have unpleasant side effects. Danazol usually relieves pain within the first cycle, but can cause nausea, greasy skin, weight gain and deepening of the voice in up to a third of women. Bromocriptine can cause dizziness, nausea or constipation. Neither can be used at the same time as the contraceptive pill. </p> <p>Clarke says: \"These are not nice drugs, and a GP will rarely give them without a consultant's opinion. In my 30 years of practice I have never prescribed Bromocriptine, and Danazol only twice.\" </p> <p>Other past suggestions have been categorically shown to have no effect. These include antibiotics, diuretics (the pain is not caused by fluid retention), progesterone suppositories and vitamin B6 tablets. </p> <p><strong>Breasts: the facts</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Each breast contains 15-20 clusters of glands designed to produce milk. Channels from each of these join together, rather like a bunch of grapes, and each cluster has a main duct which opens at the nipple. The glands are embedded in fatty tissue which gives the breasts their individual shape. </p> <p>\u0095 Breast pain is known as mastalgia. Mastitis is inflammation, usually due to infection, and is most common during breastfeeding and pregnancy. It may also be caused by smoking, and if untreated can go on to form abcesses. </p> <p>\u0095 Pregnancy will stop cyclical breast pain because the periods have stopped, although it often brings its own aches and pains as the breasts grow and swell from early on in the pregnancy, especially during breast-feeding. </p> <p>\u0095 Similarly, the pill may (but not always) reduce pain. Not recommended solely as a means of controlling breast pain. </p> <p>\u0095 Nipple disorders include eczema, which can be treated with moisturisers or steroid creams, polyps and cysts which can be surgically removed, and duct estasia, where the ducts close to the nipple dilate because of blockages and fill with thick fluid. Symptoms are a hot, red, swollen breast and possibly a retracted nipple. </p> <p>\u0095 Fibroadenomas are firm, pain less nodules of fibrous tissue which usually occur in young women and may enlarge during pregnancy. They tend to disappear without treatment. </p> <p>\u0095 Cysts, most common in women in their 40s and 50s, are fluid-filled sacs which often appear suddenly, causing a lot of pain. There may be several in one or both breasts. They may disappear on their own, or a doctor may draw off the fluid with a hypodermic needle. </p> <p>\u0095 Some women have generally knobbly breasts, a condition known as diffuse nodularity, which can occur at any age. </p> <p>\u0095One in 12 British women gets breast cancer, but this is a lifetime risk. You're most likely to develop it after the menopause, and until then the risk is less than one in 100. The prognosis is good if caught early - two thirds of all sufferers are still alive after five years, and one-third are cured. </p> <p>\u0095 Although the risk of getting breast cancer is higher after 10 years of HRT use, the risk of dying from it is less - possibly because this is a different type of cancer, or women on HRT are more breast aware. </p> <p>\u0095 Women with breast cancer in the family are usually more breast-aware than others - although only 5% of breast cancers are genetic. It is much more likely that a relative had the disease because it is common, rather than because it is hereditary. </p> <p>\u0095 Although some studies have suggested that the breasts are the body's rubbish dump, collecting toxins such as aluminum from deodorants and barium from lipsticks, this has not been proven. </p> <p>\u0095 For more information on benign breast problems, go to the Breast Care Campaign website at <a href=\"http://www.breastcare.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.breastcare.co.uk</a></p>",

  "Since Russia commissioned its first nuclear-powered submarine more than 40 years ago, the vessels have suffered numerous accidents. <p>Between 1956 and 1991 there were at least 121 incidents involving Soviet nuclear submarines, according to Greenpeace. Lack of resources since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 have aggravated the difficulty of servicing the fleet. </p> <p>Many submarines are not only driven by nuclear reactors but are also armed with ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear warheads. At least 10 accidents have involved damage to nuclear reactors. Twice, it is thought, partial meltdowns occurred. </p> <p><b> July 1961</b> The captain and seven crew died when radiation spread through the Soviet Union's first nuclear-powered submarine. A pipe in a reactor's control system had ruptured. </p> <p><b> March 1968</b> A Golf-2 class diesel-powered submarine armed with three nuclear SS-N-5 missiles sank in the Pacific. </p> <p><b> April 1970</b> A November class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank in the Atlantic off Spain. It was carrying two nuclear torpedoes. </p> <p><b> September 1977</b> A Delta-1 class nuclear-powered submarine accidentally jettisoned a nuclear warhead off Russia's eastern Kamchatka peninsula. The warhead was recovered. </p> <p><b> August 1985</b> An explosion devastated the Shkotovo-22 ship repair facility which services Soviet nuclear-powered vessels. Ten people were killed and many died later from radiation exposure. </p> <p><b> October 1986</b> A nuclear-armed submarine caught fire and sank 600 miles east of Bermuda. A Russian scientist later claimed that nuclear warheads broke open, spewing plutonium-239 into the Atlantic. </p> <p><b> April 1989</b> The Komsomolets, a Mike class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank in the Barents sea with the loss of 42 lives after a fire. </p> <p><b> September 1991</b> A missile misfired on a Typhoon class nuclear-powered submarine in the northern White Sea during a training exercise. The submarine, armed with nuclear missiles and torpedoes, returned to base safely. </p> <p><b> June 1992</b> An explosion killed an officer and injured four crewmen while a nuclear submarine was being repaired on the Kola peninsula in northern Russia. </p> <p><b> November 1992</b> A nuclear submarine caught fire while under repair in the Arctic port of Murmansk. </p> <p><b> March 1993</b> A Delta-3 class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, operating in the Barents sea, was struck by the US nuclear-powered submarine USS Grayling. Both returned to base. </p> <p><b> Summer 1993</b> An accident in a nuclear submarine killed 21 sailors and injured two more, but navy commanders tried to cover it up. </p> <p><b> March 1994</b> Two Russian submarines with nuclear weapons on board grazed each other during an exercise in the Barents sea. </p> <p><b> September 1995</b> Mains electricity to nuclear submarines was cut off, causing a cooling system on one vessel to break down. It took emergency measures to stop its reactor from overheating. </p> <p><b> January 1998</b> An accident on board a nuclear-powered submarine at an Arctic base in Listafjord, on the Kola peninsula, released toxic fumes that killed a naval officer and injured four sailors. There was no radiation leak. </p> <p>The US navy has also lost nuclear submarines at sea. In April 1963, the USS Thresher went down in 8,500 feet of water, 220 miles east of Boston. Five years later the USS Scorpion sank when a torpedo malfunctioned; all its crew were killed. In March 1986, the USS Nautilus ran aground in the Irish sea and was retired from service. </p> <p>The Royal Navy has suffered no serious accidents to its nuclear submarine fleet, although HMS Tireless has been undergoing repairs in Gibraltar since May after its cooling system developed a leak. </p>",
  "A former loyalist terrorist leader survived a murder attempt early today when a pipe bomb exploded on his car. Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair, former commander of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, escaped with minor cuts and bruising. <p>The attack happened on Beechpark Street in the Protestant side of the Oldpark district in north Belfast at 12.30am. Mr Adair had just parked his Proton car and was about to get out to talk to a group of loyalists when the assailants drew up alongside him in a vehicle and threw the device, shattering the windscreen. </p> <p>\"He's very, very lucky to be alive,\" said John White of the UFF's political wing, the Ulster Democratic party. Army bomb disposal experts later recovered the remains of a pipe bomb from the scene. Mr White said: \"If that device had landed inside the car, there's no doubt everyone inside would have been killed.\" </p> <p>Mr Adair has survived numerous past attempts on his life. He was the IRA's intended target when it bombed a fish shop on the Shankill Road in Belfast in 1993, killing nine Protestants and one of the bombers. </p> <p>He was jailed for directing terrorism but was released from prison early under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The device used in today's attack is a weapon usually associated with loyalist terrorists but Mr White blamed republican paramilitaries for the attack. </p> <p>He said: \"The pipe bomb has been sophisticated by the IRA in the form of drogue bombs and coffee jar bombs. I believe the reason they used a pipe bomb is that a gun can be traced back, whereas anyone can make a pipe bomb.\" </p> <p>Last week the RUC warned Mr Adair that republicans would attempt to kill him, Mr White said. He added: \"I think this attempt on his life was republicans trying to provoke reaction from loyalists and create the instability on which they thrive, and in order to gain more concessions in their quest to undermine our Britishness and bring about a united Ireland.\" </p> <p>North Belfast has been the scene of a series of sectarian attacks on property in recent days. Last Thursday the Ulster Freedom Fighters reinstated a threat issued earlier this summer to shoot anyone attacking Protestant homes. Mr White said: \"I would say to loyalists and republicans to draw back from the brink.\"</p> <p>Mr Adair once boasted of being behind the killing of over 20 Catholics, before being the only man ever charged and convicted of \"directing terrorism\" in 1995. Following his release late last year he was active during the Drumcree protests, and has forged links with the Loyalist Volunteer Force in Portadown.</p>",
  "<p>For a man who has been dead these past 15 years, George Orson Welles seems more than commonly busy. Like Elvis, Dick Nixon and Tupac, his ubiquity seems to increase the longer he spends in the grave. In recent years we have had the wonderful restored version of Touch Of Evil, while his planned film about the staging of The Cradle Will Rock eventually spawned Tim Robbins's Welles-bashing movie.</p> <p> He's been more sympathetically treated in Tim Burton's Ed Wood (very briefly) and RKO 281, well played by Liev Schrieber. Best of all is Pinky And The Brain, the cartoon about a Wellesian lab mouse who tries to take over the world: any doubts about the Brain's inspiration were brushed away by an episode based on The Third Man. </p> <p>The latest, and in some ways strangest, dead Orson moment is the mini-series adaptation of The Magnificent Ambersons about to start shooting in Dublin. </p> <p>Rather than going back to Booth Tarkington's novel, the series will use the script for the 1942 film, thus including the scenes lost when RKO excised and destroyed 44 minutes of the picture that Welles believed was \"much better than Kane\". </p> <p>The story is central to the Welles myth, because the film was particularly close to Welles's heart, and oddly prophetic. The Magnificent Ambersons was made as the commercial failure of Citizen Kane became clear. Despite the disappointment of that film's reception, Welles was still the great prodigy, only 26. He thought The Magnificent Ambersons, which was about love and families, might have a better chance of success with the public. And although it stuck closely to Tarkington's novel, the film is hugely autobiographical. </p> <p>The character played by Joseph Cotton is an inventor involved in the early days of the car industry, as was Welles's father. But that's just the taster: the key character is a boy called George - like Welles, utterly and totally indulged by his parents - like Welles, with the result that he eventually destroys his mother's one chance at true happiness. The townsfolk spend their time waiting for the arrogant George Amberson Minafer's \"comeuppance\"; in his Welles biography Rosebud, David Thomson entitles the section following 1942, \"Comeuppance\". The film is full of wisdom about the folly of youth, about the sad inability of 40 to teach 20 anything. The irony of the film being made by a 26 year old with a raging ego wasn't lost on everybody: Welles's own painful path to wisdom, was just around the corner. </p> <p>Towards the end of post-production in 1942, with a rough cut finished, Welles went to Brazil to work on the never-completed It's All True. While he was having a fine old time with the Rio carnival girls, RKO were panicking at test-screening reactions to The Magnificent Ambersons. \"People like to laff, not be bored to death\", read one comment. So RKO had the film re-edited to make it less gloomy, giving it a slighty less unhappy end at the cost of what legend has it were the most affecting scenes Welles ever filmed. The missing footage was disposed of. The bowdlerised film was still a flop, Welles's masterpiece was permanently damaged and his career started its steady downward slide. </p> <p>Which is where the mini-series comes in. \"What we now want to do is complete our homage and obligation to Welles\", claims RKO's Ted R Hartley, to which Welles would probably reply, it's a bit late. Nevertheless, the mini-series is a respectable project, directed by Alfonso Arau (Like Water For Chocolate) and with a strong cast that includes Madeleine Stowe, Jennifer Tilly, James Cromwell, and Jonathan Rhys-Myers. There is no reason to think it won't be good. But sticking to Welles's script - if they really do - would be a mistake. </p> <p>What made Welles's film great - and even the hacked-up version is outstanding - was the cast, the cinematography, the direction. As Arau is unlikely to use vintage cameras, or have his actors act in the style of the original cast, or pace the series like a movie from the 1940s, the new Ambersons will tell us nothing about those reportedly peerless lost 44 minutes. All it proves is that Welles - who when he was alive was offered nothing but sherry ads and guest spots on bad TV shows - is hot in Hollywood in a way he hasn't been since he arrived with a fanfare in 1939. </p> <p>A final thought: just in case you thought the vandalism inflicted on The Magnificent Ambersons belonged in the past, it was just last year that the filmmaker-friendly FilmFour managed to destroy the outtakes from Peter Mullan's excellent Orphans. Mr Welles would surely raise a sardonically amused eyebrow at how little has changed.</p>",
  "The message is definitive: it covers a wall. \"Goodbye Mr President. Farewell to the Commander-in-Chief\". But a Proustian ambivalence haunts the marbled corridors of the mausoleum. We've come not to salute William Jefferson Clinton as his moment dies - but, in search of times past and future, to visit Richard Milhous Nixon at his final resting place amid the palm trees of suburban Los Angeles. <p>Wallowing in LA money, soft and hard, these past few days, President Bill has raised $40m for would-be President Al - but also $10m or so towards the Clinton memorial library. Presidencies, as they pass, are entombed like pharaohs in the burial chambers of artefacts, papers and slavish tribute. When power ends, so the Little Rock temple of pyramid selling - all $120m of it - must rise. What will it be like, this Clinton edifice? Consider the Nixon reality of Yorba Linda: a stretch of colonnades and vibrant flowers, a hushed entrance hall, servile flunkeys - and the first exhibition hall. \"Two American icons - the First Lady and Barbie together\". Yes, here are all the Presidents' wives of history wearing their inauguration dresses as Barbie dolls. Do you like Barbie Bush in pearls and blue velvet? Or Barbie Hillary in turquoise, blonde hair piled like an ice cream cone? I cherish Barbie Mamie Eisenhower in truly shocking pink. How did you enjoy the show, Mrs Lincoln? </p> <p>So to the memorabilia. Some is standard. The poster that reads \"Ike and Dick, Sure to Click\". The sanitised story of Alger Hiss. A TV rerun of the Kennedy debates which somehow doesn't let JFK get a word in. Bulbous yellow campaign Chevrolets and tank-like presidential Cadillacs. Yet we're only warming up. In a vaulted room, life-size statues of history's greats consort. Mao, de Gaulle, Kruschev, Churchill - and Dicky. (Whatever happened to Mrs T? Or, indeed, Spiro Agnew?) \"Please\", it says round the corner, \"Do Not Touch the Berlin Wall\". And there's an eight-foot lump of concrete covered in joyful graffiti as though our hero - out of time - had borne it back from the east in person. Next door the \"gifts of the people\" sit in sombre cabinets. A wooden clockwork elephant - \"donor anonymous\". Hand-knitted portraits of Nixon's dogs. A Colt 45 semi-automatic presented by a Mr Elvis Presley of Memphis, Tennessee. </p> <p>Beyond, a long, dark tunnel tells the \"story\" of Watergate, mostly concentrating on those who spoke out for truth and justice. \"I'll be damned if we're going to let this ugliness obscure the positive record of the President\" (George Bush, 1973). Then, suddenly, the great dissembler lives. \"Ask President Nixon a question\" by pressing computer screens and a video in a little chapel of resurrection brings you his answer. \"Did you ever feel unfairly treated by the press?\" \"Is it true that you only ate Milky Way for breakfast?\" \"What was your greatest poker hand?\" And the oracle of Yorba Linda responds at length. \"There will be a 17-minute time delay on your question\" the computer reports. Bizarre!</p> <p> Outside, on a lushly watered, grassy plot, Richard and Patricia Nixon lie side by side. Inside the justifications never end. Far outside, the Republican party - pledging to restore \"dignity and honour\" to the Oval Office - continues on its pious way. Do you feel under-appreciated Mr President? Answer in 36 minutes. Will it be like this, too, in Little Rock? The Paula Jones room with muzak from Gennifer Flowers, the Monica salon where the oracle Bill repeats that he never had sex with that woman, not ever, and broods through eternity on the meaning of \"is\"? Will his party, too, turn its back in forgetfulness once the final orations, the testaments to prosperity and 22m new jobs, have faded? Probably. </p> <p>History is a half-eaten hamburger at Camp David. Kitsch comes naturally in the valley of the pharaohs. But, for the moment, watching him joshing, grinning, raising the spirits and the boodle, it's hard to believe. After 1960, Richard Nixon wrote: \"The campaign had an intensity of spirit at once exhausting and uplifting.\" Campaigns are Clinton's adrenalin, his life. And now, in life, there is death. </p>",
  "<p>Robert George is a member of a dying breed. He bought his first fishing boat when he was still a teenager. Lining for mackerel underneath the cliff tops and in the coves and inlets along the coast near Land's End, he paid off the \u00a3500 he borrowed from the bank manager within the year. </p> <p>He had the grades to go to university but the lure and rewards of the sea kept him going back. </p> <p>The work has always been hard: weeks away from his family, living with five other men in cramped and grubby conditions; enduring the mountainous seas in the fabled ground of the Irish Box, or following the shoals north into the icy winds off the Shetland Islands. Days begin at first light and end when the sun finally sets over the endless horizon. </p> <p>But for most of Robert George's 35 years at sea the rewards have been worth the hardship. A hold full of cod or haddock could fetch its weight in silver in Newlyn harbour. Every voyage was a treasure hunt for the men on the Dew-Gen-Ny (God with us). Each member of the crew got a share, so even the lowliest deck hand could earn a small fortune after a successful week. Three trips in a row Mr George broke the port record for a catch into Newlyn. </p> <p>\"It is not a job, it is a way of life, 365 days a year,\" said Gordon, the engineering officer on the Dew-Gen-Ny. \"I'm a dying breed but I love fishing. Maybe it's the sunrises at sea, I don't really know; maybe its the fact that when you're out there that's all there is. You leave everything else behind and just concentrate on the fishing. I don't want to do anything else.\" </p> <p>But now the Dew-Gen-Ny is up for sale and Mr George wants out of the industry. Sitting in his local pub after 12 gruelling days at sea, he said the excitement has gone out of the business. What used to be a treasure hunt has had its heart ripped out by dreaded EU quotas and overfished waters. </p> <p>No longer can hard work and a good trip guarantee a healthy bank balance. More often than not half the catch has been thrown back because the fish are too small or because the boat has reached its quota. </p> <p>Not that the nets are full anymore. The seas around the UK have been trawled out, and while more and more boats work the grounds the pot of gold on the ocean floor is now little more than a thimble. </p> <p>\"There are too many boats trying to make a living out of not enough fish. The efficient will survive but the inefficient won't,\" he said. </p> <p>According to the other fishermen in Newlyn Mr George is one of the most efficient there is, and when he decides to get out it really is time to start worrying about their industry. </p> <p>He is not an isolated case. An atmosphere of doom and gloom pervades the quays and streets of Newlyn. Nearly every inhabitant is linked with the industry, from the men who make the nets to the landlord in the Dolphin pub. </p> <p>The fleet has been in steady decline for the past 10 years. The boats are ageing beyond repair and when the government offered generous terms for decommissioning in the early 1990s, more than 40 owners jumped at the chance. </p> <p>\"That is more than 120 jobs lost,\" said Nathan de Rozarieux, chief executive of the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation. \"If they offered the same terms again a lot more skippers would take them up on it.\" </p> <p>According to Mr de Rozarieux, the quotas, brought in to protect falling stocks, have been a disaster, as well as a source of antagonism against the Spanish and the French. The fishermen of Cornwall claim their waters have been plundered by the foreigners with their bigger, more efficient boats and bigger quotas. </p> <p>They want no-fishing zones, areas of the sea bed where the fish can replenish their dwindling numbers. But they have little faith in the government and even less in the EU to do what they see as the right thing. </p> <p>\"We are fast becoming just a cottage industry,\" said one of the local fish merchants. \"There will still be fishermen, but the industry won't support the jobs it does now. We have managed to keep things going so far, but if there is not a change soon we will have to start laying people off.\" </p> <p>But the Cornish fishing industry is not just suffering from an acute lack of fish, there is also an acute lack of men. A sign above one of the merchants reads \"Save our fish\". But perhaps it should also read \"save our fishermen\". The older fishermen and merchants remember when the quay would be full of boys helping to unload the fish, bunking off school to wash down the boxes. </p> <p>Justin, whose father and grandfather were fishermen, was one of those boys. From the age of 12 his teachers were lucky if they saw him more than one day a week when the trawlers were unloading. </p> <p>He began his first job as a deck hand on his 16th birthday and he has been at sea 250 days of every year ever since. He is now 25 and works on the Dew-Gen-Ny, but although he says he loves the life, he would not advise any teenager to go into the industry now. </p> <p>\"Where is the future in it? Its just not viable. It would be all right if we were whales or seals or something like that. The country would be up in arms to save us. We're an endangered species,\" he said. </p> <p>Even the experienced skippers and mates are leaving the industry in their droves. They are working the supply ships that feed the rigs in the North sea for a steady wage. </p> <p>W Stevenson and Sons is the biggest fishing company in Newlyn. It runs 36 boats, many of them named after long deceased family members who have built up the business over the past 150 years. The company employs a further 100 people on shore. </p> <p>But only 19 boats are working at the moment. Half a dozen are having re-fits, but they can't find crews for the rest. \"There is a real shortage of experienced skippers; they seem to have just disappeared into thin air,\" said Elizabeth Stevenson. </p> <p>\"Its partly all the forms and things they need to fill in, all the rules and regulations that have had imposed. Suddenly from just having a good knowledge of the sea and of fishing they need to be a bloody mathematician as well. If he makes an honest mistake he can be up in court for thousands of pounds.\" </p> <p>And the state of the industry? \"It's really quite grim. If things don't start changing soon I suppose redundancies are a possibility.\" </p> <p>Robin Turner, whose family have been fish merchants since 1760, said it was hardly surprising the young were turning away from fishing. </p> <p>\"They go down to the quay and they see these old rust bucket vessels and it must frighten them to death. They look and think to themselves that they don't want to be working on those boats for the next 40 years, and you can't blame them. It is their necks they are putting on the line. The sea does not take any prisoners; I attend enough bloody funerals to know that.\" </p> <p>Fishing is acknowledged to be one of the most dangerous industries to work in, on a par with mining. During his 10 years in the industry the number of people Justin knows who have been killed is well into double figures. </p> <p>He counts off the names of people and boats on one of his hands. \"There was a friend of mine swept overboard while he was shooting the line ... there was a boat that was hit by a cargo ship ... they didn't even realise until they found the mast on the deck the next morning ... they never found his body....\" </p> <p>According to Justin the shortage of men is making the problem worse. Skippers are having to take whatever crew they can to get to sea.</p>",
  "<p>A quarter of the world's fish catch now comes from pirate boats, flying flags of convenience and flouting international law to hunt down valuable but endangered species such as tuna. </p> <p>Pirate fishing has doubled in the last 10 years, threatening to drive some fish to extinction. Fearing the collapse of world fisheries, the UN is to crack down on the illegal business at a meeting in Rome in October to agree international controls. </p> <p>The UN refers to the practice as IUU fishing - illegal, unregulated and unreported. Draft rules due to be agreed by 180 countries would close all ports to IUU fishermen to prevent them refuelling, taking on fresh crews or landing catches. The rules would also demand the closure of companies that own and control the illegal ships. </p> <p>Pirate ships are regularly registered in countries such as Panama, Honduras, Belize and Cyprus to avoid fishing regulations but are owned by companies in Europe, the United States and Japan. </p> <p>These boats, often large factory-style trawlers roam the Atlantic and Southern Ocean catching tuna and the Patagonian toothfish. Toothfish, sold as Antarctic or Southern ocean sea bass in Britain, is known as white gold to the pirate fishermen because of its high value. </p> <p>In 1997, according to UN estimates, the illegal catch of Patagonian toothfish was around 100,000 tonnes with a value of more than \u00a3300m. Illegal fishing is expected to cause extinction of the toothfish in two to three years. </p> <p>Although an international fishing agreement is in operation in the Antarctic to try to save the toothfish, the commission for the conservation of Antarctic marine resources has no method of enforcing its rules, and illegal vessels outnumber legal ones three to one. </p> <p>One boat suspected of carrying illegally-caught bigeye tuna worth up to \u00a31m is being held in the Japanese port of Shimizu while officials investigate the origins of the catch. Greenpeace tracked the Japanese owned and crewed freezer vessel flying the Panamanian flag from the Atlantic where it was filmed loading the tuna from two other vessels, one flying the Belize flag and the second a Cambodia flag. </p> <p>All three were acting illegally under international law, because in the Atlantic only countries that are members of the international commission for the conservation of Atlantic tunas can legally fish. </p> <p>In 1999, the governments of Japan and the US tabled evidence identifying 345 flag-of-convenience vessels fishing for tuna in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. They flew flags from 17 countries, notably Honduras (103), Belize (83), Equatorial Guinea (51) and St Vincent and the Grenadines (50). Most are owned and managed by Taiwanese enterprises. </p> <p>Simon Reddy of Greenpeace said: \"Ultimately, it is the lure of big money paid for high-quality tuna, especially on the Japanese market, that provides the incentive for the activities of the pirate fleet. </p> <p>\"In recent years, the wholesale price paid at landing for top sashimi-quality tuna has reached more than \u00a370 a pound, with some of the largest, high quality individual tuna fetching up to \u00a330,000 each.\"</p>",
  "Evidence emerged yesterday of how hearsay and score-settling played a role in the creation of a \"paedophile\" hit list used to justify nightly demonstrations on the Paulsgrove council estate in Portsmouth. <p>The protesters' original list of 20 names included two people against whom no charges had been brought, three people placed purely out of vindictiveness, and a 17-year-old boy involved in a relationship with a 15-year-old girl. </p> <p>The 20 names were compiled in \"mental lists\" known to leaders of the marches on the Paulsgrove estate, and were the basis for the list phoned to police at the weekend as part of the demonstrators' truce with the authorities. </p> <p>In return, Portsmouth city council yesterday agreed to offer rehousing to those named, but stressed that it had no legal powers to move former offenders. </p> <p>The council's acting chief executive, Roger Ching, condemned the actions of a lawless minority but reflected public concern in a strongly worded statement. </p> <p>After a meeting with residents, he said: \"We will speak to the people on the list and if they feel under threat, we will move them to a place of safety.\" </p> <p>The council plans to set up a working group with residents, which will help them seek changes in the law concerning sex offenders \"especially on length of sentence and housing priority\". </p> <p>However, one of the residents' leaders admitted there was little or no foundation for naming over a quarter of those on the original list. </p> <p>Five innocent families have been forced off the estate by the marchers and 24 people have been arrested for their part in the disturbances since the News of the World started naming former sex offenders. </p> <p>Barry Pettinger, 51, a residents' spokesman, said some names had been removed from the list before it was phoned to police. He said: \"Of the 20 suggestions in the first instance there were two people who had not faced prosecution. </p> <p>\"Three of them, maybe somebody was stirring it up, but we just had to blank those out because there was no evidence against these people whatsoever. </p> <p>\"One person who was mentioned, we know for a fact that it is not what we would call sexual abuse against children. It was a 17-year-old boy who apparently had sex with a 15-year-old girl.\" </p> <p>Mr Pettinger went further than previous claims about the source of the list, saying: \"The list has been compiled from evidence from members of abused families. Lots of it has been verified by newspaper cuttings. It is local knowledge.\" </p> <p>Police said not all those on the list handed to them were known paedophiles. </p> <p><b>Useful links: </b><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Sexual_Predators/index.asp\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fdle.state.fl.us/Sexual_Predators/index.asp</a> Florida's sexual predators database</p> <p><a href=\"http://nt2.ec.man.ac.uk/risk\" target=\"_NEW\">http://nt2.ec.man.ac.uk/risk</a> Collection of information on the creation of sex-offender registers</p>",
  "<p>Hasnat Khan has never been one to follow his own advice. As a heart surgeon he tells his patients to stay away from greasy foods, do lots of exercise and keep healthy. As an individual he eats takeaways, smokes heavily and drinks a lot of coffee. Those who know him say he is a quiet, shy man who likes to keep himself to himself. In 1995 he started dating the most famous, least private individual in the world - the Princess of Wales. </p> <p>But while Diana's ill-fated escape from the long lens and tabloid obsession has at least saved her from the pain of further intrusion, Khan has lived on as one of the few remaining people in her life around whom some mystery remained. </p> <p>Until now, at least. For just when we thought there could not possibly be anything more to reveal, yet another branch of the Diana memorial industry has emerged with news that Hasnat was not just the man she loved, but the man she intended to marry. </p> <p>In a documentary tonight, Imran Khan (no relation) will confess that the princess asked him to act as a marriage broker between her and Hasnat. \"It was clear she was very deeply in love with him,\" says the cricketer-turned-politician. \"I don't think she could have got over it that quickly.\" His confession comes hot on the heels of another book, Diana: Her Last Love, by Kate Snell, which is dedicated solely to the affair. </p> <p>Khan is as unlikely a candidate for tabloid fodder as he was as a partner for Diana. He is neither indiscreet nor of aristocratic stock, like James Hewitt; nor is he a flashy playboy type like the late Dodi Fayed. He is a chubby-faced, unimposing, moustachioed doctor dedicated to his work. </p> <p>True, he has been compared to Omar Sharif and described as the \"dishy doctor\", and, after she broke up with Prince Charles, Diana vowed she would never again become involved with an Englishman. But place him in a lineup of probable mates for the late princess and it is doubtful that he would be picked out. </p> <p>Nor is there much in his background to suggest that he would find himself in such a situation. Contrary to reports about his humble beginnings, he was raised in a wealthy, middle-class family in Pakistan, near the city of Jhelum, about 120 miles north of Lahore. </p> <p>He was the eldest child in a family of four. His father, Rasheed, helped to found a successful business making glassware and bottles for the domestic market. But the real head of the household was his grandmother, Mrs Forkhunda Ayyub, known as Nanny Appa, a fact that would be of vital importance as his relationship with Diana developed. Hasnat attended and excelled at a Convent school in Jhelum, which he left to study medicine in Lahore after his A-levels. When his studies were over he went to Australia, where he started to specialise in heart surgery thanks to his uncle's contacts. He finally settled in England in the early 90s. </p> <p>By all accounts his first meeting with Diana did far more for her than it did for him. He was working in the Royal Brompton heart and lung hospital, assisting in a triple heart bypass operation that was being performed on Joseph Toffolo, the husband of Diana's acupuncturist, Oonagh. </p> <p>Diana had just arrived to see Joseph when Hasnat walked in. \"He merely acknowledged her with a formal nod then proceeded to focus on Joseph's condition,\" Oonagh told Snell. \"It is doubtful whether the Princess of Wales had ever made less of an impression on anyone in her entire life.\" Hasnat rather incredibly claims that at the time he had no idea who she was. \"I didn't even recognise her,\" he says. </p> <p>But as her visits to the hospital became far more frequent they got to know each other well. When she was spotted making a late night visit to the Brompton one winter's evening by a News of the World photographer, she called the paper's Royal editor on his mobile and told him she was simply there to comfort the sick and dying. </p> <p>The knowledge that the media were on to something did not temper her ardour. Indulging Hasnat's love of jazz, she bought him CDs of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Dave Brubeck, and accompanied him to Ronnie Scott's jazz club in Soho. </p> <p>But even though the affection was not exactly one way, Diana had invested far more in the relationship than Hasnat did. He had never been lucky in love. He was engaged to a Pakistani doctor, Nazra Nasim, for three years before she married somebody else. And his second fiancee, Furial Anwar, called off their relationship after a year. Diana wanted to run away with him to Australia or South Africa where she thought they could \"be alone\". </p> <p> During a visit to Pakistan in 1997 Diana slipped away from the media pack to visit his family in Jhelum. Whatever Hasnat's feelings, there could be no marriage without the consent of Nanny Appa, and while the subject was not broached directly Diana felt she should meet his family. </p> <p>A year earlier she had entertained Nanny Appa at Kensington Palace, where Diana presented her with a silver rose bowl. A video of the meeting shows Diana's relief as Hasnat's grandmother touched the princess's cheek in gratitude. At one point, Mrs Ayyub, a Muslim, lifted up the corners of her sandwiches, apparently checking to see if they contain ham. Diana assured her the filling was salmon. </p> <p>But within a year Hasnat's affections had cooled. He was fond of the princess but could not handle the media scrums and intrusive reporting. It was around this time that she sought the help and counsel of Imran Khan. \"I was going to talk to him to find out the reason,\" he says. \"Having married someone from outside my culture, if there was something that could be cleared up, or some advice given, maybe I could help.\" This is why he believes that the pictures of the princess's final days with Dodi Fayed were deliberately calculated to make Hasnat jealous and win him back. </p> <p>\u0095 Diana: Her True Love, Channel 5, tonight 8pm</p>",
  "The military ruler of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, proclaimed his support yesterday for the guerrillas fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, giving an unashamedly anti-Indian slant to the celebration of Independence Day. <p>\"Pakistan stands united with its Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their just cause and will continue to extend all moral, diplomatic and political support to their indigenous struggle against state-sponsored terrorism,\" he said. </p> <p>\"South Asia is an extremely volatile region due to the intractability of the Indian government over Kashmir.\" </p> <p>India accuses Pakistan of arming and funding the guerrillas, as well as giving them political support, an accusation which Pakistan always denies. </p> <p>A wave of violence has claimed more than 100 lives in Indian Kashmir in the past week since a leading Pakistan-based militant group, the Hizbul Mojahedin, called off its ceasefire after only 15 days. </p> <p>On Sunday 22 people died and 52 were injured in gun battles and by landmines in the state. Indian forces expected more violence on the eve of their Independence Day celebrations today. </p> <p>In Islamabad banners lining the capital's broad avenues condemned India for human rights violations in Kashmir. \"When you hear a wounded valley cry do you turn and walk away?\" one read. </p> <p>Market stalls sold national flags with a portrait of the country's founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, alongside the newest medium-range missile, the Ghauri, which can carry a nuclear warhead to New Delhi. </p> <p>Badges were on sale with pictures of Kalashnikov rifles over the slogan \"Crush India\". </p> <p>Others had pictures of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the scientist behind the country's nuclear industry, and the date and time of the nuclear tests in the deserts of Baluchistan two years ago which made Pakistan the world's newest nuclear power. </p> <p>A stallholder, Asak, said: \"Dr Khan is a great man and Pakistan needs this bomb. It has made us a leader in the Muslim world. He is a man without any scandal, not like the politicians. But we hate India for what they are doing in Kashmir. If the Kashmir dispute is solved everyone will love the Indians.\" </p> <p>Gen Musharraf, who seized power last October, admitted that Pakistan was struggling with huge economic, social and political problems. \"It is the elite that has exploited the people and abused the immense potential of the country for their petty personal gains in total disregard of greater national interests,\" he said. </p> <p>Later, in a televised address, he announced his government's final plans for local government reform, involving 21-member councils elected on a non-party basis in place of the system of appointed local officials established by the British 200 years ago. </p> <p>In the elections, beginning in December, women will compete for a third of the seats and religious minorities will elect their own candidates. </p> <p>The reforms have been in the pipeline for several months, and some politicians have accused the general of trying to weaken national party organisations while others say the changes look too similar to those introduced by previous military dictators, Ayub Khan in the 1960s and Zia ul-Haq in the 1980s.</p>",
  "He is 77, and needs two sticks to walk, but the American novelist Norman Mailer last night proved he could still kick up a storm by condemning the sexual revolution in which he played such an active part. <p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Executioner's Song and The Naked and the Dead, claimed women had won the sex war \"hands down\" and were \"walking all over\" their broken menfolk. \"Women have won everything. Men have sunk into their dugouts and pulled the metal covers over while women are rampaging over them.\" </p> <p>The six times married Mailer, who stabbed his second wife Adele in 1960 after an all-night party, said the women's movement has been \"sold down the river for a mess of corporate pottage\" and sympathised with President Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair. \"Mon frere, I thought. I'd have done it myself.\" </p> <p>The US had become \"like a wife or a lover you want to throw out the window in order to rescue them\". </p> <p>The one-time champion of 1960s radicalism told an audience at the Edinburgh International Book Festival that the time had come for a reaction against the sexual revolution. </p> <p>\"It's got cheesy around the edges. It was once something noble, we were fighting the system with it. In the course of freeing sex we were freeing mankind. If one now has the equipment and the desire one can have a good time anywhere. Even local papers in the smallest, uptight German towns are full of ads for sex. </p> <p>\"Like everything, it has got corporate. So I don't look with horror on the prospect of repression coming along, so we can have another sexual revolution at a higher level.\" </p> <p>Women were kidding themselves if they thought the \"mediocrities\" who run the corporate world would let them get right to the top, argued Mailer, who once ran to be mayor of New York. </p> <p>\"You can't take power from mediocrities because they work 24 hours a day to keep what they have. You see these women in their marvellous tailored black suits and their laptops on the aeroplanes and you realise how the women's revolution has been sold for a mess of corporate pottage, because the mediocrities at the top will never let them in. The intensity of anti-feminist feeling in America is now greater than anti-semitism.\" </p> <p>Corporations were running the country by remote control, he claimed. \"American politics is being consumed and devoured by them. The presidency has in effect become like the monarchy in England.\" </p> <p>The real horror of Clinton's \"non-horizontal sex with Lewinsky\", he said, was the \"piety of the hypocrites who say he has defiled the presidency and who at the same time do oil deals that destroy forests and pollute the seas. Men do it, women do it, corporate executives do it, ordinary guys do it between dustbins down alleys.\" </p> <p>But he added: \"Clinton was a huge disappointment to me. \"His major sin was the dreadful way he kissed up the corporations and did away with poor people's welfare but not the corporations' welfare.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Meanwhile, the Edinburgh Film Festival started yesterday - after an embarrassing hitch when the projector broke down before the premiere of Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark. The opening gala, attended by Billy Connolly and Robert Carlyle, got underway 20 minutes late. </p> <p>And there were queues around the block at the Assembly Rooms, where the voice artists of the TV cartoon show The Simpsons appeared in a classic episode.

  "Four British soldiers were injured in violent clashes in the Kosovan town of Mitrovice yesterday, as the UN launched an operation to reassert its authority in the province. <p>Three soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, suffered head injuries and were taken back to their base in Pristina. Another suffered a hand injury. Six Serbs were also injured in the clashes outside a factory complex in the predominantly Serbnorth of the town. </p> <p>The operation saw 900 troops from Britain, Denmark and France take control of the lead smelting plant which the UN said was polluting the local environment. </p> <p>The violence erupted as workers arriving to start their shifts at the Serb-run complex gathered outside an entrance. British troops manning checkpoints nearby were attacked by up to 500 people angry at the operation. </p> <p>Rubber bullets were fired and the crowd was charged by the Fusiliers with batons as the soldiers came under a hail of stones. The British troops were ultimately ordered to withdraw and were replaced by French troops. </p> <p>It is only the second time this year that British soldiers have been deployed in Mitrovice. A spokesman for the French army, Henry Aussavy, put the violence down to local hostility. \"It seems that the Serbs do not like the English,\" he said. Britain is hated for its prominent role in Nato's bombing of Kosovo last year. </p> <p>UN officials said that the takeover was prompted by an increase in lead emissions from the factory, which began to work full-time in June. They that said that air samples indicated pollution levels 200 times above World Health Organisation standards. </p> <p>But the American UN administrator of Mitrovice, William L Nash, said that the takeover was part of a much broader security operation. He admitted that the UN was going to change the structure of local municipal boards in the region over the next few days. </p> <p>Sources inside the UN said that members of Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party (SPS) were expected to be removed from their posts. Local Serb leaders have accused the party of attempting to undermine their authority in the region. </p> <p>Mr Nash said that the UN wanted to see a change in the political balance of local authorities. \"We are quite anxious to deal with those people who are interested in democracy, and those that are not interested in democracy can go elsewhere. They can leave Kosovo in a variety of ways.\" </p> <p>Doctors from the local hospital in northern Mitrovice dismissed claims that the smelter was causing pollution. Doctor Radosav Jankovic said: \"We haven't had a patient with a toxicology problem for years. Today only soldiers and Unmik [UN Mission in Kosovo] police officers suffer problems of lead in the blood.\" </p> <p>The head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, denied those claims, saying that at least 160 cases of lead poisoning were being reported a year. He also confirmed that an international consortium had been appointed to run the plant and that the UN had promised workers an advance of 50 deutschmarks (\u00a315.40) on their wages. A $16m (\u00a310.7m) investment package was also announced, funded by Britain, France, Spain, Germany, and the EU. Money is to be spent on a full-scale refurbishment of the plant. </p> <p>Local leaders have voiced concerns that workers may have to be laid off and part of the factory closed. This was also denied by Dr Kouchner. </p> <p>\"We have no intention of closing any part of the Trepca mining complex. On the contrary, we're going to make it safe and profitable.\" </p> <p>Outside the factory there was scepticism about the UN's plans. \"We don't know if they're just going to pay us once and then get rid of us,\" one woman said. </p> <p>At the same time as the operation to close the factory went ahead, a Jordanian special police unit working with the UN closed down a local radio station which had been ordered off the air on Saturday night. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, responsible for media regulation in Kosovo, said that Radio S had failed to apply for a broadcasting licence. The station's director is also a member of the SPS.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton was set to make one last bravura appearance in front of the adoring Democratic faithful last night, opening the party convention in Los Angeles, before slipping quietly out of town and leaving Al Gore to see what he can make out of his mixed legacy. <p>It was the climax of a long weekend in Los Angeles during which Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary have rarely been out of the spotlight, before leaving Mr Gore to put his own stamp on the Democratic party when he arrives in Los Angeles tomorrow. </p> <p>Before then the president will symbolically pass the torch to his deputy at a campaign event in Michigan, after which, the Gore campaign desperately hopes, Mr Clinton will conquer his instincts and fade into the background. </p> <p>The president was expected to mount a trenchant defence of his eight-year administration last night, arguing that it was absurd for the Republican presidential candidate, George W Bush to say that he and Mr Gore deserved no credit for America's soaring economy and greater social peace. </p> <p>America's sustained growth, budgetary surpluses and record home ownership would be at risk under anyone other than Mr Gore, he was expected to say. </p> <p>The speech was not expected to mention the Monica Lewinsky affair or the impeachment crisis which followed it. </p> <p>Aides did not expect him to offer another apology for his behaviour, since any mention of the scandal would snatch the headlines away from a speech designed to set out what he hopes will be his more lasting political legacy. </p> <p>In preparation for the valedictory address, aides said, he had been studying the much-admired way in which Ronald Reagan choreographed the similar moment in his own career, when he passed the baton to George Bush at the Republican convention in New Orleans in 1988. </p> <p>While Mr Reagan was widely applauded for the way he quickly left the stage, many critics have asked this week whether Mr Clinton can bring himself ever to do so. </p> <p>Mrs Clinton was also due to address the convention last night, becoming the only presidential spouse since her idol Eleanor Roosevelt to speak at three successive Democratic conventions. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday Mr Clinton rounded off an intensive three days of fundraising with a series of meetings with some of the Democratic party's core supporters, including blacks, Latinos and trade unions. </p> <p>He told reporters that he was confident that Mr Gore could overtake Mr Bush's persistent poll lead, but said it would take hard work to energise the electorate in a prosperous era, without the major divisions or crises of the past. </p> <p>\"We can turn around these polls, but it's not the work of a day. It's going to take every day between now and November,\" he told a brunch in honour of his cabinet. </p> <p>\"You've got to go out of this convention committed to telling people this is a big election, there are big differences, in spite of all the good that's been done in the last eight years you haven't seen anything yet.\" </p> <p>Everything Mr Clinton said and did in Los Angeles reflected the bitter-sweet character of these final months of his presidency. On the one hand, he wants to draw attention to his achievements by any and every means possible. On the other, he is aware that the more he appears to hog the limelight, the more difficult he is making Mr Gore's task. </p> <p>As he toured a succession of star-studded fundraising functions at the weekend, he showed yet again how much he is being pulled in opposite directions. </p> <p>\"How quickly it all passed, and what an absolute joy it was,\" he told a gathering in his honour on Saturday night. </p> <p>\"For me this was not only the greatest honour of my life but every day, even the bad days, were good days.\" </p> <p>Interviewed by the Los Angeles Times yesterday, he once again stressed his desire to surrender the leading role to Mr Gore while simultaneously demonstrating a characteristically obsessive interest in all aspects of the campaign to succeed him. </p> <p>And he could not restrain himself from looking forward to playing a back-seat driver's role in a Gore administration. </p> <p>\"I told Al once that if he got elected president, my main goal would be to stay out of his way, because America can only afford one president at a time,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But if he wanted to talk to me, I'd be glad to talk to him.\"</p>",
  "The government is expected to make it a criminal offence to publicise the names or addresses of scientists, bankers and shareholders involved in drug testing on animals as part of a wider crackdown on animal rights militants. <p>After years of targeting individuals engaged in violent acts at the extremist end of the animal rights movement, ministers are now working with research groups and police to target the planning behind individual acts. </p> <p>The Home Office confirmed last night that the minister responsible, Mike O'Brien, is engaged in efforts to tighten a range of laws which fail to address such problems as criminal damage and harassment. </p> <p>Such tactics extend to intimidating telephone calls at midnight, and to floods of unwanted goods that arrive at targets' homes - goods which range from clothing to skips which arrive by lorry. </p> <p>\"I once had 40 calls as a result of a small ad to sell my cement mixer. That was clearly harassment. After the 39th call I changed my telephone number,\" Mark Matfield, spokesman for the Research Defence Society (RDS), said last night. </p> <p>After Mr O'Brien visited Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), Europe's biggest contract research company, he convened a meeting with police and scientific interests. </p> <p>The company's shares have slipped since fund manager Phillips &amp; Drew sold its 11% share cheaply after a bomb threat in February. </p> <p>Though tighter restrictions on the use of names and addresses is a frontrunner for change, the DTI is examining the implications for companies which must, by law, publish such details of shareholders. </p> <p>Home Office officials distinguish legitimate public protest from the increasingly sophisticated violence, often attributed to the loosely designated Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and associated bodies. </p> <p>The Prohibition of Harassment Act, 1997, which has been used successfully against people who target fur traders, is being looked at again in the light of the 1,200 reported incidents of animal rights protest in 1999. </p> <p>But the scientific community is convinced that those convicted of dangerous assaults do not get the sentences they might if their perceived \"ideals\" were not being taken into account. </p> <p>Dr Matfield said last night that the AFL had shifted its tactics in recent years away from car bomb spectaculars towards harassment campaigns against individuals associated with research, either as employees or investors.</p>",
  "Gore won a standing ovation as the Democratic convention kicked off by telling a delighted audience that the United States had become \"the greatest terrorist and the largest rogue state\" in the world. He was also applauded loudly after announcing that today \"only corporate America enjoys representation\". <p>This was Gore Vidal, it should be said, former Democratic politician, novelist, playwright, historian, mischief-maker and cousin of young Al. He was addressing a full house at the Leo Baeck temple just opposite that symbol of corporate authority, the Getty Centre, as the delegates assembled for the first day of the convention. </p> <p>Vidal lamented that \"50 years ago I used to be the only Gore\" and used his presentation to a \"town hall\" meeting organised by the magazine the Nation to urge whoever was the next president to use his entire first term of office to \"tame the American military\". He attacked the Pentagon as a major reason for the collapse of the democratic system in the United States and for the waste of public money. </p> <p>\"Congress has been hijacked by corporate America and its enforcers,\" Vidal said. \"Our empire is now the greatest terrorist of all.\" </p> <p>He said that since the Soviet Union \"unsportingly disbanded\", the world's 1bn Muslims have been demonised as wild fanatics in order to justify the continuation of military spending. </p> <p>Since 1946, he said, $7.1 trillion had been spent on defence while national debts totalled $3.6 trillion. </p> <p>Vidal also attacked the American drug laws saying that \"we started the damn country\" to get away from such restrictions and suggested that the founding fathers had included many laudanum addicts. \"Anything taken for joy is against God's will,\" had become the justification for the drugs laws, he said. </p> <p>People had forgotten the effects of prohibition, he said: \"We have become the United States of Amnesia.\" He accused the US of \"swaggering round the world smashing countries like Colombia\" and finished his address to a standing ovation and cries of \"run, Gore, run!\" from the audience. </p> <p>Tom Hayden, now a Californian senator but arrested at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago during the anti-war demonstrations, voiced his support for the thousands who have already taken to the streets of Los Angeles in some of the rolling demonstrations taking place during the week. </p> <p>\"The Democratic party should not try and stigmatise the people who raised hell in Seattle and gave birth to a new generation of radicalism,\" said Mr Hayden. </p> <p>\"More and more people are feeling that there is no other way than to get out on the streets. It is a great blessing instead of a danger to the city of Los Angeles. Everyone in this room was someone real and vibrant before they became middle-aged.\" </p> <p>Jesse Jackson Jr, 35, congressman and delegate at the convention, said that people now believed that they had a right to a gun but not a right to a proper education. A few miles away his father addressed a rally outside Loews hotel in Santa Monica to call for union rights for the hotel workers there. </p> <p>The gatherings were just two of dozens due to be held this week by those who suggest that the real issues are not being addressed by the convention. The first of the major demonstrations, in support of the journalist and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal who has been on death row in Pennsylvania since 1981, took place on Sunday as did a large picket of Gap. There were protests yesterday to support abortion rights and highlight \"corporate shame\".</p>",
  "Two teenage sisters who fatally attacked and robbed an 87-year-old family friend and neighbour were yesterday warned they would face long jail sentences. <p>Jean Lyons, 19, and her sister Kellie, 17, kicked and beat Lillian MacKenzie at her second floor flat on the Woodberry Down estate in Manor House, north London, before leaving with about \u00a3800 of her savings in January. Mrs MacKenzie died in hospital a week later after suffering seven broken ribs and severe bruising to her back and chest.</p> <p>The sisters had lived with their mother two floors below Mrs MacKenzie and had received money, birthday cards and advice from the widow, known as Rose, who had taken an interest in their lives.</p> <p>A jury at the Old Bailey yesterday cleared the sisters of murder but convicted them of Mrs MacKenzie's manslaughter. Kellie was also convicted of robbing Mrs MacKenzie, a charge Jean had previously admitted.</p> <p>Judge Michael Combe warned the sisters that they would face a long time in jail after they were sentenced on September 4. \"These crimes cry out for and must have substantial sentences in order to deter others,\" he told them.</p> <p>He also lifted the ban on identifying the teenagers, saying the \"very serious crime and the circumstances of it\" meant such a ban was not in the public interest.</p> <p>Ann Curnow QC, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs MacKenzie, who was 4ft 10in tall and suffered from chronic heart disease, had been expecting a visit from a hairdresser when the sisters, who were wearing black clothes and balaclavas, called at her door.</p> <p>\"It was a fearsome attack,\" Ms Curnow said. \"They later bragged to friends that they had 'done an old lady'. They were in a 'hyper' mood as they described how they knocked on her door, hit her, turned out the light, kicked her when she fell and stamped on her.</p> <p>\"She was screaming for mercy but received none.\"</p> <p>Jean, a cocaine and heroin user, had later demonstrated to friends how she had wielded an iron bar which had since been thrown into a canal, Ms Curnow said.</p> <p>The sisters took about \u00a3800 and Mrs MacKenzie's bank and pension books from behind some tiles in her bathroom. The widow, who lived alone, had previously confided to the teenagers where she kept her valuables.</p> <p>The court heard that Jean and Kellie Lyons had been inseparable before they were arrested and had both been training to sell perfume door-to-door. They had been arrested after they boasted of what they had done and friends went to the police.</p> <p>Jean admitted robbery but said it was her younger sister who had kicked Mrs MacKenzie. Kellie had told police she had not been involved in the attack but had been ill in bed at the time.</p> <p>She said she had loved Mrs MacKenzie \"like a nan\".</p> <p>\"I was really close to her,\" she said. \"I enjoyed her company and she enjoyed mine. I went to the shops with her on occasions and we sometimes ate fish and chips together. I miss her. I wish she was not dead.\"</p> <p>Outside court, Mrs MacKenzie's great-nephew, Jeff Bennett, said: \"She was an elderly lady who would not do anyone any harm. She trusted these girls. If she had survived, she would have been even more shocked to know it was them. I am quite grateful that she never knew.\"</p> <p>Her sister-in-law, Wynn Smith, said: \"She was a perfect person who never harmed a soul. She should have been able to end her days in peace rather than having her life shattered and dying in agony.\"</p> <p>Mrs MacKenzie had lived in the flat for 40 years and was popular on the estate. The first person she had asked for after the attack was Bridget Kinsella, the sisters' mother.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Patricia Gallan said: \"They were both young girls who liked to have a good time. We have never discovered the motive for the attack.\"</p> <p>She added that neither sister had shown any real remorse over the attack.</p>",
  "For a brief moment things looked hopeful in the unhappy valley of Kashmir. But after a weekend of attacks on Indian security forces, the recent ceasefire by Hizbul Mojahedin is taking on the musty smell of ancient history. On July 24 Hizbul Mojahedin declared a ceasefire. The group is one of the oldest and most powerful of those fighting the Indian army. Expectations for a new beginning ran high, and seemed to be justified as India first suspended its offensive against Hizbul and then officially met its representatives. <p>However, the talks soon broke off. India refused to accept the involvement of Pakistan. Hope lingered until Thursday. But Hizbul's attacks have put paid to any negotiations in the near future. None the less, the whole episode gives an insight into the movement of the greatest fault line in south Asian politics. </p> <p>Kashmir has been the flashpoint for two wars since 1947. Pakistan's claim to the territory rests on its Muslim population and its border with Muslim Pakistan. India's claim rests on the decision of Hari Singh, the last maharajah of Kashmir, to join the Indian Union in 1947, and on the fact that his kingdom, which became the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, was home to many Hindus and some Buddhists, as well as Muslims. </p> <p>It was not until 1989 that guerrilla movements sprang up among the easygoing Kashmiris. The Afghans' success against the Soviet army inspired similar tactics. And some of the western weapons and money that were flowing through Pakistan were easily diverted towards Kashmir. Soon, foreigners (Pakistanis, Afghans and even Arabs) became involved. </p> <p>The insurgency developed a season. Fighters cross the mountains dividing the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir as they become passable in late spring. The insurgents operate through the summer against the 125,000 Indian soldiers stationed in the valley. They are supplied with food, shelter, weapons and medicine via Pakistan. As the autumn snows fall in the mountains the guerrillas retreat across the porous \"line of control\" separating the combatants. </p> <p>Last year witnessed a twist to this pattern. By early spring, fighters had already crossed the mountains and seized the region of Kargil. Battle was joined with India shelling the insurgents' salient and the United States pressing Pakistan to have its clients withdraw. The insurgents' eventual retreat was seen as a defeat for Pakistan. It led swiftly to the overthrow of the civilian government of Nawaz Sharif and the resumption of military rule. </p> <p> Pakistan's fingerprints are all over the recent ceasefire. Officially, the government was neutral. Pakistan only gives what it describes curiously as political, diplomatic and moral support to the insurgent groups. General Musharraf, who seized power in the coup, refused either to praise or criticise the ceasefire. However, it is no coincidence that the ceasefire was offered by one of the few groups of Kashmiris who support union with Pakistan. Musharraf himself called the ceasefire \"an opportunity for dialogue with India\". That it broke down over the issue of just such a dialogue confirms Pakistan's involvement. </p> <p>In the eyes of the world the ceasefire has left Pakistan looking relatively moderate over Kashmir. India, on the other hand, triumphant last summer, now appears unwilling to go the extra mile. General Musharraf's peaceful noises will have pleased the Americans, which is vital if he is to drag his country out of its economic and political morass. Meanwhile he has lost nothing. No one in his army can say he took the pressure off India. The insurgency went on throughout Hizbul's ceasefire with, for example, the murder of 90 Hindu pilgrims. </p> <p>Yet Pakistan's position remains weak. The insurgents are a doubtful weapon. They pin down Indian troops and goad them into acts of oppression, no doubt. But meanwhile the fighters encourage the spread of Islamism in the Pakistani army. They also let the Taliban blackmail Pakistan over the presence of its paramilitary camps in Afghanistan. </p> <p>The support of foreign states also has its pitfalls. CIA revelations that China helped Pakistan develop ballistic missile technology will serve only to frighten the west. China already occupies part of northern Kashmir. It would be happy for the Tibetan people of Ladakh to fall under its control. It is willing to help Pakistan compete in an expensive and time-consuming large arms race. But China will be less keen to sell small arms that could find their way to its own Muslim insurgents in Xinjiang. </p> <p>With the prospect of mutually assured destruction hanging above south Asia, peace in Kashmir is not a luxury but a necessity. The west must invest in economic and political stability in Pakistan. Then all the peoples of Kashmir should be asked what future they want: status quo, union with Pakistan or independence. This question, however, cannot be posed until fair elections are possible. The fighting must stop and paramilitary weapons must be silenced. Hizbul Mojahedin's short ceasefire has at least set a precedent for that silence. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A couple who have been on the run for seven years after defying the forced marriage system are to use the Human Rights Act to try to win greater protection from vindictive relatives. <p>Jack and Zena Briggs have been forced to move home 27 times since their secret wedding in 1994, because of fears that their false identity package is too thin to deceive Zena's family, who had previously planned her marriage to a cousin in Pakistan.</p> <p>The pair, who courted in Bradford after meeting in one of the city's parks, say that they are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and cannot get jobs, because the protection package includes no employment history or references and the Home Office has refused to issue birth and marriage certificates to go with their new names and passports.</p> <p>\"The police, local authorities and even senior government ministers have chosen to ignore our problems. Now we want justice. We want them to admit they got it wrong,\" said Jack, 39.</p> <p>\"We were hunted like animals, and when we turned to the authorities for help we were treated like animals. They have lied to us, passed us over, betrayed us and abandoned us.</p> <p>\"We set out so full of hope of starting a new life together, but those hopes have come to nothing. We are worse off than when we started out.\"</p> <p>Zena Briggs, 28, who came from a prosperous Muslim background in contrast to her husband's lack of qualifications and succession of manual jobs, said that she had thought about suicide because of the \"dreary and friendless\" regime of being holed up for 23 hours a day.</p> <p>She said: \"All we did was get married and we have been punished for it, not only by my family, but by a system that has chosen to ignore us.\"</p> <p>The couple plan to bring a case when the Human Rights Act becomes law in October, suing for the complete new identities offered to police \"supergrasses\" and former terrorists. They say that the case has implications for other victims of attempts at forced marriages - an illegal perversion of the arranged marriage system used by some Asian-origin families with prospective partners' consent.</p> <p>The Briggses have highlighted the issue in a book published three years ago, and they lobbied the junior Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, last year, with Ann Cryer, the Labour MP for Keighley, who has been prominent in attacking forced marriages.</p> <p>But Mr Briggs said that they now felt they had been \"used\" in order to spotlight the issue, but had subsequently been left to founder.</p> <p>The Home Office said that the issue could be tested when the Human Rights Act became law, but denied that the couple had been short-changed on protection.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"At Mr O'Brien's meeting with Jack and Zena Briggs, he made it clear that the handling of the case was an operational matter for police and that ministers had no authority to intervene.</p> <p>\"The police acted properly and the couple are now adjudged not to be at risk,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>The Home Office added that police had offered the couple suitable safe accommodation at one stage, but this had been rejected.</p> <p>However, Mr Briggs said that the offer had been too risky, because it was in a town with a large number of asylum seekers and a recent history of racist attacks.</p> <p>The couple say that they do not feel out of danger, because one of Zena's relatives had told her that the family would bide its time.</p> <p>Mr Briggs added: \"If we had been given the full new identity package, we could have started a new life. We believe that our civil and human rights have been breached.\"</p>",
  "Foyle's, until recently the world's most eccentric bookshop, has discovered - a little late in the day - that it is bursting at the seams with unwanted paper. <p>Yesterday it launched its first ever book sale, a vulgarity unthinkable in the era of the bookloving autocrat Christina Foyle, who ran the company for almost 70 years until she died last June. </p> <p>A tenth of the stock in the enormous shop in Charing Cross Road, central London, has been reduced in price, at least 50,000 volumes and music sheets, many of which have languished unsold for up to 30 years. </p> <p>These are the fruit of decades of \"bad stock management and over-zealous buying\", according to Anthony Foyle, a director and nephew of Christina. </p> <p>The fiction sale offers Irma Kurtz's 1993 novel Jinx for \u00a32. In fact, many books in the sale date from 1993, the year Foyle's unwisely opted to buy from wholesalers instead of publishers. This meant publishers stopped buying back works which proved unsaleable. </p> <p>In the music section, Davidoff's Romance sans Paroles is going for a song at \u00a31.30. Astronomy tomes once costing \u00a380 to \u00a390 are reduced to a few pounds. </p> <p>Browsing among the bargains is a reminder of the awesome comprehensiveness which has made Foyle's internationally admired. The Latin section still stocks a school crib to Julius Caesar's De Bello Civili, as it did 50 years ago. </p> <p>For specialists, it remains the supreme bookshop. Even so, \"We have got to bring Foyles fully into the 21st century,\" acting manager Robert Palmer said. </p> <p>In October the store will get its first electronic stock control system so customers can check if a book is in stock without searching a labyrinth of shelves. Soon - even more unthinkably to Christina Foyle - it will start selling volumes on a website.</p>",

  "We are very good at collective emotion when it comes to children. This was demonstrated recently by the nationwide response to Sarah Payne's abduction and death and, in a darker, more distorted way, by the paedophile witch-hunts being conducted on housing estates where locals claim child abusers are living. <p>Both are responses to the unbearable awfulness of what happened to a small girl and proof positive, surely, that we care passionately about what happens to all children not just our own. I, as much as anyone, was caught up in the sense of anguish and impotence. And like many others I longed for a way to do something to make the situation better. But if we step back from the emotion centred on Sarah and the irresponsible fanning of hatred against alleged paedophiles, spuriously justified as a response to public feeling, there is an important question to be addressed. How far are we prepared to go to try to protect children before something goes wrong, to act to prevent the small-scale abuses as well as the ones that enthral us with their horror? </p> <p>This is not an idle question. Every day thousands of children are subjected to abuses of one kind or another, whether it is being emotionally neglected, humiliated, hit, sexually exploited by someone known or, far more rarely, abducted. And often enough it is happening where we can see, hear or know it if we care to do so, behind Designer's Guild curtains as well as on grim housing estates, by men and women who look unimpeachable as well as those who fit our stereotypes of men with shifty eyes, unkempt bodies and impenetrable lives. </p> <p> Yet it is possible that much of this could be prevented or stopped if we reacted when we saw things that were worrying, disturbing or which seemed downright cruel. But to do so means burying our fears of interfering, of making a fool of ourselves, of getting it wrong. Easier to laugh and say we're being silly, that what we saw didn't mean what we feared it might. I know because I was confronted with just this a while back. I was in the carpark of a large supermarket one hot Sunday afternoon when the place was more or less empty. I saw two well-dressed men manoeuvring a small boy into the back seat of a smart saloon car. The child was protesting, although not very loudly. But I glimpsed his face. He looked scared and the men didn't seem to have much rapport with him. </p> <p>It didn't feel right, but even so my first impulse was to reassure myself - two dads out shopping together, a tired child who was being troublesome. They were keen to get home for tea and had had enough. But what if it wasn't like that? What if next day I read in the paper that a small boy had been abducted from this supermarket... I took the number of the car before it drove off. Even then I hesitated before phoning the police, fearing that they would think me interfering, stupidly anxious. Instead when I phoned, apologising for troubling them, they told me it was the right thing to do, they would much rather get the call than not, they would check out the car and ring me back if they found anything worrying. </p> <p>I am not alone. Some 750 people a week phone the NSPCC helpline to report anxieties about things to do with children, whether it's a slap in a shop or a succession of men visiting a house where a small girl lives. The charity talks it through with them then decides whether to ask social services or the police to act further. But an awful lot of people including, I suspect, some of those who are quickest to make a fuss or join demonstrations in a self-righteous way, do not see that protecting children means each of us taking responsibility for acting if we are worried. </p> <p>Of course the flipside of this is that we must not mind if, as presumably happened with the two men I reported, we are stopped and questioned by police, visited in our homes by social workers and so on, uncomfortable and intrusive though this may be. If nothing is wrong it should be a short-lived interference. Isn't it worth putting up with if it is a result of someone trying to ensure that a child is safe and well? </p> <p>At last, long after the passing of the Children's Act and the adoption of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, there does seem to be a growing awareness that children are society's responsibility as well as their parents'. But acting on this has to be more than the collective, and often symbolic, emotional catharsis that may make us feel good but may actually do little to protect children who are victims of the daily suffering which does not make the newspapers but goes on in our streets, our car parks, our society all the time. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Children under the age of 14 are working on the ranch of the Mexican president-elect, Vicente Fox, sowing onions and potatoes in contravention of laws banning child labour, a newspaper reported at the weekend. <p>The Mexico City daily Reforma said on Saturday that it had found at least 30 minors and teenagers being taken by truck into the Fox family ranch, San Cristobal, in the central state of Guanajuato, to work in the fields for about 65 pesos (about \u00a34) a day. </p> <p>The Mexican constitution bans children younger than 14 from working. Children between 14 and 16 are only allowed to work six hours a day, and the country recently ratified an International Labour Organisation convention against some of the worst forms of abuse of children as workers. </p> <p>Nevertheless, child labour, especially in the impoverished countryside, is common. </p> <p>Mr Fox, who recently returned from a tour of South America in his first foreign trip before taking office on December 1, spent the weekend at the ranch. His aides could not be reached for comment. </p> <p>Reforma said that among the more than 30 youngsters picked up at 5.30am on Saturday were 12-year-old Jose, 13-year-old Juan and 11-year-old Sanjuana. </p> <p>It said the children showed its reporter their 390-peso (\u00a328) weekly paycheck. Reforma said that since the children were hired as seasonal workers, they received no other benefits. </p> <p>Many of the children had left school to help earn money for their families. They worked from 7am to around 4pm, taking an hour lunch break. </p> <p>A young man who appeared to be taking care of them, Mario, aged 20, complained about the hard work and low pay. \"It barely pays for food and they don't pay you for every day you work,\" Mario said. </p> <p>On July 2 Mr Fox broke the Institutional Revolutional party's 71-year grip on the presidency. Running for the conservative National Action party, he promised to battle against corruption and a widespread disregard for the law.</p>",
  "\u0095While Mr Tony Blair enjoys his Italian holiday, his enormous, rock-solid lead in the polls suggests a long and secure political future. Suppose, however, that as in Nigel Farndale's compelling new novel A Suitable Hanging, an assassin took Mr T out. Who would take over? <p>This is what West Highland terrier Steptoe, conqueror of TV's Thommo (45) in the 1995 Great Tipster Stakes, has been considering. After Gordon Brown's wedding the dog has revised his market as follows. Gordon Brown is now the 4-6 odds-on favourite, with current Blairite preference David Blunkett second best at 13-2. Jack Straw, John Prescott and Mo Mowlam are all 12-1, while O'Mandy Mandelson is 14-1. At 18-1, with Ken Livingstone and Sir Alex Ferguson, is public health minister Yvette Cooper. That's with a proper haircut. While she still looks like a swotty 14-year-old boy, Steptoe quotes her at 50-1. Bunched at 100-1, meanwhile, are Alan Milburn, Stephen Byers, Keith Harris, Orville, Margaret Beckett, Caroline from Big Brother, Robin Cook, Bruno Brookes and Geoff Hoon. Clare \"Bomber\" Short is 250-1. \u0095And so to our favourite UK tourist attraction: the Yelverton Paperweight Centre in Dartmouth. \"Both the casual visitor and the serious collector,\" says the leaflet, \"are fascinated by the range of beautifully handcrafted millefiori and abstract designs.\" I certainly was on Friday when I nipped in to what is \"reputed to be the largest private collection open to the public in Europe.\" Indeed. The centre is only three miles from Drake's home, and some scholars may wish, in the light of this, to reassess what he originally had in mind for the potato. Admission is free, but parties of 25 or more should ring before a visit on 01822 854250. </p> <p>\u0095Brace yourselves for some truly shocking news. Gerald Kaufman, who arrived last week on loan from Spitting Image producer Roger Law to prepare for his tour to Leeds in the Rolls-Royce Corniche RR1, has vanished. He was last seen in the office on Friday reading his Guardian and playing solitaire, but yesterday morning he was gone. Rumours that a party of Finnish tourists saw him in the West End negotiating with a tout outside Abba musical Mamma Mia are being investigated, but the police are taking the matter extremely seriously. </p> <p>\u0095In the down-market Daily Telegraph, the Peterborough column impertinently tries to tease Steven Berkoff over an Observer article about the Edinburgh festival. \"Yes there is in this festival an element of the preacher, the divulger of valued thoughts; the dissenter; lamentations on the state of man; burning issues; contentious views, passionate beliefs. We are gathered together,\" he goes on, \"to bound our values, to weave a giant tapestry of beliefs.\" Wonderfully acute - and how dare my so-called rival seek to ridicule Steven over this. Frankly, I'm too angry to go on. </p> <p>\u0095In the Spectator, meanwhile, my old friend Andrew Neil contributes his diary, taking as his main topic his own wealth, which runs to a home and a satellite dish in France.

  "<p>It is the issue that has been dominating the back pages of the tabloids all summer. David Beckham, Manchester United's star player, has reportedly fallen out with his boss Sir Alex Ferguson and could be moving overseas for a world record transfer fee. </p> <p>Offers of \u00a340m are said to have been tabled by foreign clubs. Mr Beckham is reputedly being offered a \u00a32m signing on fee and \u00a3120,000 per week to forsake Manchester for Milan. Mrs Beckham could even get her own TV show as part of the deal. </p> <p>While football transfer fees and players wages have seemingly spiralled out of control this summer, big City institutions have started to set up wealth management divisions aimed at sports' huge earners. If David and Spice Girl wife Victoria do decide to pack their bags for Italy it would be little surprise to see advisers from Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group and UBS Warburg jostling with the paparazzi on their villa doorstep. </p> <p>Merrills is the latest Wall Street group to start providing asset management services for athletes and \"celebrity net-worth individuals\". </p> <p><strong> Unrivalled roster</strong><br> </p> <p> Last month it announced a joint venture with sports agency IMG's Investment Advisers International to form McCormack Advisers International. IMG was founded in the 1960s by Mark McCormack, the grandfather of sports agents. Driven by the success of his first client, the golfer Arnold Palmer, he now boasts an unrivalled roster of clients, including the Williams sisters in tennis, US basketball player Vince Carter and golf's Tiger Woods. </p> <p>According to Merrill Lynch vice chairman John L. Steffens, the entity will offer wealth-management strategies and advisory services, including financial planning, tax preparation, cash and investment management and income collecting. They will be competing with Swiss banks UBS Warburg and CSFB which have both launched financial management services tailored to sports players. </p> <p>Previously private banking was the preserve of wealthy, long-established families but twenty-something athletes on Hollywood-style wages are now just as exciting a proposition. </p> <p>UBS's team is based in London and headed by Neil Grainger, who previously spent 20 years working at IMG, and Paul Miller, a Uefa cup winner with Tottenham Hotspur, who has been working in private banking for the past seven years. While the company says it has advised sports stars on their finances for several years, spiralling players wages have encouraged it to expand operations. </p> <p>\"We want to offer athletes cradle to grave financial advice,\" Mr Miller says. \"We're not just about asset management, we will help with ISAs, pensions, insurance against injury, property, estate management, the lot. </p> <p>He says footballers go through three five-year stages in their career. Between 16-21 they are at the apprentice stage and need to be helped with the basics of financial management. In their mid-to-late 20's they are at peak earnings stage and then they enter winding down time. Footballers need to take a different financial approach to each of those stages. </p> <p>Even today many footballers think that investing for the future means buying the local pub. Although sports stars have a potential for rapid escalation of earnings while they are playing sport, they rarely have a second chance to recreate any \"lost\" wealth, UBS says. </p> <p>\"When I was playing we got little advice on financial planning and much of it was not brilliant,\" adds Mr Miller. \"I've been down the same road as today's players, played in cup finals, moved club and had to renegotiate contracts, so they can relate to me.\" UBS is targeting the richest sports: football, tennis, golf and motor sport. On the purer entertainment side it is also building up a client list from the worlds of media, pop and classical music. </p> <p>The bank plans to extend its presence to Germany, Italy and the United States. \"If a young man is transferred from London to Barcelona, UBS in Barcelona can take charge of his affairs,\" says Mr Miller. Rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse offers a service in partnership with Interbroke, a British-based sports insurer, providing coverage for things like loss of sponsorship contracts, or injury and similar risks as well as financial advice. It has 100 clients, aims for 1,000 by 2003 and is run by Olivier Jaquet, who was a silver medallist at the 1994 World Fencing Championship. Both banks work closely with leading accountancy and legal firms because of the complex financial and tax issues that high-earning sports stars face. </p> <p><strong> Dodgy knees</strong><br> </p> <p> Extended family members often need to be provided for and pensions that kick in when the knees give up at 35 need to be arranged. Chicago Bulls basketball player Ron Artest reportedly employs a security consultant, a clothier and a barber, as well as supporting several family members. </p> <p>Many of the world's top tennis players and motor racing drivers have started to manage their tax liabilities by basing themselves in havens like Monaco (David Coulthard) and Bermuda (Pat Rafter) when they are not on tour. </p> <p>Yet not even some of the world's leading entrepreneurs and oldest dynasties can compete with the allure of British Open golf winner Tiger Woods. The 24-year-old's career earnings could reach $6bn, according to ESPN magazine.

  "If this were not a deadly serious, indeed a seriously deadly issue, the Ministry of Defence's latest statements over Britain's bombing performance during the Kosovo war would be worthy of a Yes, Minister script. We now know from the leak of a confidential Whitehall report that, far from scoring a resounding success, the RAF's \"dumb\" bombs hit their targets only 2% of the time. The guided bombs were better but, overall, the RAF had a worse performance than in Bosnia or Iraq. Faced with this embarrassing disclosure, the MoD now says its earlier statement that the Kosovo campaign was the \"most accurate ever conducted\" was \"relative\". The boast was true \"relative to the operational environment\" - ie taking account of the facts that the weather over Kosovo was cloudy much of the time, the RAF had run out of \"smart bombs\", and pilots were told to fly so high that they could not easily see what they were trying to hit. In other words, the RAF won the race relative to the fact that all the other runners got to the finishing line before it. <p>The MoD's nonsense is not unique. The US secretary of defense, William Cohen, claimed last September that \"of the thousands of bombs that were dropped and the missiles that were fired, nearly all of them hit the intended target\". Presumably, it all depends what you mean by a \"target\". If it is a general target zone with a centre and an enormous circumference, perhaps you can justify that comment. General Wesley Clark, commander of Nato forces during the Yugoslav campaign, tried a different tack. He purred last October: \"I just want to emphasise the incredible precision of the bombing: the fact that on 78 days with over 23,000 weapons dropped or fired, there were only 20 incidents of collateral damage.\" Decoded, that means Nato was extremely lucky. The bombs mostly failed to hit anything military. Fortunately, they also missed civilians - at least some of the time. The independent agency, Human Rights Watch, has calculated that Nato bombs killed about 200 people in Serbia and 300 (mostly Albanians) in Kosovo. The killing has not yet stopped, as unsuspecting people unexpectedly trigger hidden cluster bombs. </p> <p>The human damage apart, the worst aspect of the newly revealed inaccuracy is the way the government hushed it up. Perhaps because it took place in Europe, but certainly because it was Nato's first shooting war, public opinion throughout the alliance's member nations was engaged as never before. The propaganda battle was vital. But it is now clear that the authorities deceived the public about the effectiveness of the air strikes, not only while the conflict was under way, but even after it ended. The leaked report about inaccuracies was given to a closed conference of defence analysts in February, a day after the same officials who heard it had been sitting with journalists for a much more triumphant public presentation. This was classic Whitehall whitewash - one story for the public, the truth for the experts. When the magazine Flight International bravely prepared to reveal this, it was served with a D notice. </p> <p>Nato prides itself on being an alliance of democracies, but the Kosovo war showed a disturbing lack of public accountability. The overwhelming message which emerges from this latest \"lesson from Kosovo\" is that an independent inquiry into Nato's targeting policy is needed. Parliamentary select committees have already looked at many aspects of the war, but yesterday's revelations hint at further crucial answers still waiting to be given.</p>",
  "Three decades after playing a starring role in one of the 20th century's most notorious American trials, the leading Chicago lawyer, Thomas Foran, has died at the age of 76. <p>Foran was the abrasive federal prosecutor in the 1969-70 case brought against the radical protesters, known as the Chicago 7, for allegedly conspiring to cross state lines to incite the riot that wrecked the 1968 Democratic party convention in Chicago. In fact, eight people were originally charged, but the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale clashed so vehemently with the bench that Judge Julius Hoffman had him bound and gagged in the dock, and later jailed him for four years for contempt - thus removing him from the case. </p> <p>This, however, was only the most dramatic episode in a four-month trial in which the defendants ostentatiously read newspapers in court, pulled faces at Hoffman, passed sweets and marijuana to one another, and barracked the judge and prosecution lawyers with obscene comments. </p> <p>The charges had been filed under provisions in President Lyndon Johnson's 1968 Civil Rights Act designed to curb the spreading protests against the Vietnam war. Since many observers assessed the mayhem in the streets surrounding the convention hall as a police riot, the US attorney general, Ramsey Clark, was extremely reluctant to act against any demonstrators. </p> <p>That infuriated Chicago's mayor, Richard Daley, who wanted someone's head on a charger for the slur on his city's reputation. With the encouragement of the newly installed Nixon administration, he persuaded a crony on the federal bench to convene a grand jury to rule whether the law had been breached. In March 1969, the jury issued indictments against eight demonstrators and eight police officers. Foran, who owed Mayor Daley his previous year's appointment as US attorney for northern Illinois (a regional office of the federal government), presented the initial case to the grand jury and, 13 months after the riots, took charge of the prosecution. </p> <p>In later years, he described his daily conflicts with the defence team and its clients as \"root canal work all day long.\" The battle opened with jury selection. The defence wanted to probe the 300 candidates' attitudes through a list of 54 questions, including \"Do you know who Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix are?\" Judge Hoffman only allowed one; whether or not prospective jurors had relatives or friends connected with law enforcement. </p> <p>Day after day, Foran, relying in part on the evidence of government agents who had penetrated the protesters' organisations, relentlessly questioned them about their inflammatory speeches in the months before the convention. His case was greatly helped when Judge Hoffman refused to allow the defence to cite other speeches which emphasised the defendants' intention to demonstrate peaceably. </p> <p>The case proceeded amid growing chaos in the courtroom, with the defendants verbally attacking the judge and covering the floor with rubbish. They denied ever meeting as a group and one of their witnesses, Norman Mailer, said that the left was incapable of conspiracy \"because they're all egomaniacs\". </p> <p>No sooner had the jury retired than Hoffman gave all the defendants, and their lawyers, long prison terms on 159 counts of criminal contempt. </p> <p>The jury eventually acquitted all defendants of conspiracy, but convicted five of crossing state lines to incite a riot. Each was given five years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. All the sentences were quashed on appeal, and Hoffman's conduct was condemned, particularly his refusal to allow full questioning of potential jurors. All the policemen were acquitted. </p> <p>The lesson that Foran, a lifelong Democrat, drew from the experience was entirely political. \"The worst thing about the convention,\" he mused much later, \"was that it gave us Richard Nixon. And because of that, the Vietnam war continued for another four or five years\". </p> <p>The case certainly did not blight Foran's career. He had taken to the law after serving as a torpedo bomber pilot in the second world war. Having qualified in 1950, he opened his own partnership in Chicago in 1957. During Mayor Daley's frenzied redevelopment of the city centre, Foran frequently acted for the municipality in major projects, including its vast water reclamation scheme, one of the most expensive construction projects in the world - with commensurate legal fees. </p> <p>In his role as a US attorney, Foran spent the years after the Chicago 7 case mounting a highly successful campaign against the mid-west's many prominent Mafia figures. Among the 150 he managed to haul before the courts over a two-year period were such local bigwigs as Felix Alderisio, Jackie Cerone, Fifi Buccieri, Richard Cain and William Daddano. </p> <p>Foran is survived by his wife, Jean, and their six children. </p> <p>\u0095 Thomas Aquinas Foran, lawyer, born January 11 1924; died August 6 2000</p>",
  "Recipients of some early editions yesterday were left reading the racing page of June 5 (page 10, Sport). This was due to a computer-system error at the printers, for which many apologies. <p>A leading article yesterday, page 17, said it was time to vary who ran the national lottery, and Sir Richard Branson's company, the People's Lottery, deserved a chance. For the record, the outgoing managing director of Guardian Newspapers, Caroline Marland, is, in her personal capacity, a non-executive director of the People's Lottery.</p> <p> Also touching on this subject, Tom Bower, page 9, G2, August 10, said the National Lottery Commission's choice of the next operator \"requires the approval of Chris Smith and probably Tony Blair\". The Department for Culture, Media and Sport points out that the commissioners' decision requires no political approval under the 1998 law governing the lottery.</p> <p> A hundred children aged five to 14 were murdered in England and Wales last year, not five as in yesterday's G2 cover story. Five was the number killed by strangers. </p> <p>A column yesterday, page 15, said that the campaign in Scotland against section 28 (which inhibits discussion of homosexuality in schools by banning its promotion) was financed by millionaire Brian Souter.
