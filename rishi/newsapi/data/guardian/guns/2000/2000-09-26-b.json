  "<p>As a workplace question, \"How are you?\" has only three acceptable answers: \"Stressed\"; \"Oh, you know, really busy\";\"Frantic, absolutely frantic.\" Any other answer, especially one that implies you are not running around like a headless chicken, can be taken as a sign of slacking. </p> <p>Stress and activity are the new white-collar sources of identity. I don't have time to think, therefore I am. And the trouble is that once one person plays the stress card, the pressure to conform is huge. Forget the business struggle: the busyness battle is where it's at. We are engaged in a craziness competition. </p> <p>Of course, it is not enough to say you are rushed off your feet - you have to be seen to be busy to be believed. Herein lie the roots of the presenteeism culture flowering in many workplaces. It is no good being frantically busy where no one can see you, after all. </p> <p>The pressure to stick around is not new: Napoleon used to leave a bust in a lighted window so his generals thought he was still working. Now, though, the senior people are the most likely to work long hours and expect others to follow suit. </p> <p>Robert Kennedy, investigating union-mob ties in the US in 1957, and in particular the role of the Teamsters Union boss Jimmy Hoffa, was heading home one night when he saw lights still on in the Teamsters HQ. Bobby ordered the car to turn around and went back to work. Hoffa, learning of this, ordered the lights left on every night. The exhausted Kennedy didn't get his man (not until 1964, anyway). </p> <p>The visible busyness craze is particularly absurd given the rise of IT. Not just because laptops, modems and mobiles make it easier to work outside the workplace, but because computers have made it easier than ever to avoid work in the workplace. A person sitting at a desk looking at a screen is \"working\". Oh really? Chances are they are emailing their mates, booking holiday flights or paying their phone bill. That's why firms are rushing around blocking access to internet sites, monitoring email and devising policies designed to make people use their PCs for work rather than play. </p> <p>IT can and should support flexible working. And everyone is in favour of flexibility. The problem is that there are two kinds: corporate flexibility and worker flexibility. When firms say they want their staff to work flexibly, outside of \"normal\" hours (whatever they are now), they mean on top of those hours. Workers want the flexibility to work hours instead of the fixed ones: in a recent survey by the Institute of Directors, just 20% of employees said they wanted a fixed nine-to-five, 50% wanted flexibility between 7.30am and 7.30pm, and the rest wanted to work any time. </p> <p>Working time is still based on an industrial era in which workers needed to be physically present, slacking was quickly spotted and control of bodies was more important than control of brains. Work is moving back towards a more fluid, pre-industrial pattern, with bursts of productivity followed by more fallow, reflective periods. The eight-hour, five-day week is a straitjacket on this kind of working. It is fine to work in the evening so long as you don't have to clock on at 9am the next day. Control over working hours - and the ability to work at times that make sense to us as individuals - is the key, rather than the number of hours worked. It is time sovereignty we should be fighting for now. </p> <p>It is difficult for many managers to let go of the need to see their staff to know they are working. But the truth is that different people work better at different times of day and under different circumstances. Would Archimedes have shouted \"Eureka!\" from behind an office partition? Let's ditch the nine-to-five and the \"clocking on\" culture, and work according to our own individual patterns. For in work, as in much else, timing is everything.</p> <p><strong> That Friday feeling</strong></p> <p>There is now another reason to Thank God it's Friday. Certain merchant banks have discovered that people who are fired on Fridays are more likely to take their own lives than those \"let go\" on another day. As a result, Friday firings have been banned. The theory is that the routine of a normal weekday - and the fact that recruitment agencies are open - allows victims to feel they are taking control of the situation. Saturday and Sunday just allow the news to fester and sink in, apparently. \"It is our idea of being humane,\" says one director of a major bank that has adopted the policy. So that's the good news. The bad news: today is Wednesday.</p> <p>Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society.

  "<p>It is either one of the biggest daily hazards of modern working life or a myth concocted by the idle to justify their laziness: it all depends on your perspective. For those who believe in it, sick building syndrome has long been thought to stem from poorly maintained air conditioning systems, toxic photocopiers and dusty offices. Now, in a curious echo of another of our greatest workplace fears, it seems the explanation could lie in a particularly nasty form of computer virus. </p> <p>According to a team of Swedish scientists, flame-retardant chemicals used in plastic computer casings could be to blame. The researchers conducted experiments which showed how, as computers heated up during the course of the working day, they began to emit into the air an allergenic chemical, triphenyl phosphate. Eighteen leading brands of computer were tested and now the experts are urging manufacturers to \"bake off\" new computers for 10 days to release the worst of the chemicals before they arrive in office buildings. </p> <p>The discovery may finally provide the evidence needed to convince those who still need convincing that sick building syndrome has a scientific basis, instead of being a malingerer's charter. The Health and Safety Executive, which monitors office environments, estimates that between a third and a half of all new or re-conditioned buildings are afflicted; the employees at highest risk, according to a recent study by the University of Strathclyde, are clerical workers who wear contact lenses and work at computers in air-conditioned buildings. Airborne bacteria in such offices, which often have low levels of humidity, become electrically charged and settle on computer screens or on contact lenses, or are breathed in. </p> <p>The travels of bacteria around offices and into workers' nostrils may not be an appetising field of study, but professor Derek Clements-Croome of Reading University has made it his own. The author of Creating the Productive Workplace, Clements-Croome advises companies on how to avoid sick building syndrome. He talks zealously about \"the emotional content of space\" and is evangelical about improving the quality of air in the workplace. </p> <p>\"It takes just four seconds for a single breath to travel from your nostrils to your blood supply,\" he says. \"But if the air is stuffy or polluted, you can't oxygenate that breath, so you become tired and sluggish.\" </p> <p>His research notwithstanding, the most alarming thing about the bacteria with which we share our workspaces is how little we know them. \"The biggest problem with these types of airborne chemicals is that we don't yet know the effects of long-term exposure to them,\" says Professor Vyvyan Howard, a toxicologist at Liverpool University. \"They are pernicious because you breathe them in but then the body doesn't get rid of them. They are fat-soluble and persistent - our bodies retain the toxic chemicals. If you're a woman and become pregnant, experiments have shown you pass a dose to your child. In the past 20 years, there's been a 60-fold increase in these compounds in breast milk - and in the last five years the figure has doubled.\" </p> <p>Likely effects of exposure can include skin rashes, allergic reactions akin to hay fever, tiredness and flu-like symptoms. So far the only known way to alleviate the effects is really vigorous ventilation - not exactly a speciality of most British offices. </p> <p>When companies ask Clements-Croome about the ideal office space, he sends them to Japan, to the Kajima building in Tokyo. There they have an atrium filled with birdsong and a scented garden. \"There's music, but it's not constant - human beings like contrast and change. From time to time, people walk by and offer trays of refreshments. You don't order from a cafeteria, they just bring you things so you feel cared for. </p> <p>\"The mistake architects make when designing office spaces is that they appeal only to the aesthetic. Office environments need to stimulate all five senses in a harmonious way. That means providing a good amount of natural light, nice smells and no jarring background noise. Touch is often forgotten - we need to be surrounded by natural surfaces such as glass, wood and stone.\" </p> <p>That's all very well for moneyed multinationals moving into new premises, but even companies stuck with decrepit buildings can go a long way to creating a healthy environment. \"All companies should provide alternative spaces where workers can take breaks,\" Clements-Croome says. \"A coffee break is of no use. Generally, we work in two-hour cycles, then we feel a dip because our brain is asking us to do something else. Rather than be inactive, we need to be stimulated in a different way - by listening to music, meditating, taking exercise or having a massage.\" </p> <p>Even the most expensive office technology may contribute to the problem, rather than alleviate it. \"As human beings, we have a deep desire to control our environment,\" Clements-Croome says. \"If the windows are locked because of the air conditioning, that will create resentment and depression among workers.\" </p> <p>A glimpse of what the future may hold is to be had at Home, a new London-based firm of estate agents. Oak floorboards have replaced depressing carpet tiles; there are TV screens built into corrugated iron, leather armchairs, poodle-hair upholstery and a help-yourself jelly- bean dispenser. The purpose, of course, is to sell houses, but there is more to it than that, according to Rosalyn Dexter, Home's \"design and ergonomics consultant\". (She avoids the term \"feng shui\" because firms are increasingly suspicious of it, she says.) </p> <p>\"Our workspaces are constantly subliminally sending messages to us and that has an impact on our health and wellbeing,\" Dexter says. \"You don't want offices to be Zen-like and calm, they need to stimulate creativity and productivity, and design can do that. Artwork, symbolism and colour can help - empty walls are very negative.\" </p> <p>The positioning of desks can create subtle hierarchies, she argues - power divisions in open-plan offices that can cause stress among workers if not managed properly. The confrontational opposition of desks so common in contemporary offices is a particularly bad idea. \"We all bring emotional stuff to our desks,\" she says. \"We don't need to be dealing with other people's emotions over them.\" </p> <p>Yet the best advice may ultimately be the most old-fashioned: plenty of plants (especially spider plants, which help oxidise the air) and plenty of happy photographs. Not that these need to be the traditional gallery of spouse, family or friends. \"A great trick is to put pictures up all around your desk of the things you want to buy or achieve through your job,\" Dexter says. \"One chap I worked with in a City firm had large photos of his dream place in the sun. It worked wonders for his sales technique.\"</p>",

  "Escalating Yugoslavia's political crisis, Slobodan Milosevic has defied international calls for him to step down and called a runoff election against the dour law professor who the opposition claims defeated him. <p>The state election commission announced today that opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica finished first in the weekend presidential elections but without enough votes to avoid a runoff with Milosevic. </p> <p>The commission said Kostunica won 48.22 percent of the vote in Sunday's ballot to 40.23 for Milosevic. </p> <p>\"In short, in the presidential elections there will be a second round,\" TV said. The announcement could escalate the Yugoslav political crisis. The opposition claims Kostunica won outright and has refused to join the runoff, scheduled for 8 October. </p> <p>Yugoslav opposition leaders had given the commission until tomorrow to release the final election results.</p> <p>By midday today, the commission had not reconvened after a brief meeting Sunday night, according to Sinisa Nikolic, a commission member from the ranks of the opposition alliance. </p> <p>But the chairman of the commission, Borivoje Vukicevic, told several dozen foreign observes from \"friendly\" countries - such as Russia, China and some African countries which had monitored the balloting - that the commission was working \"efficiently and in accordance with the law.\" </p> <p>More than 40,000 people turned out for a second night yesterday in Belgrade to celebrate what the opposition and much of the international community has said was a stunning victory. The mood was jubilant, with people celebrating what they thought was the final end of Milosevic's 13-year autocratic rule. Opposition supporters also flooded streets in other towns across Serbia, cheering long into the night. </p> <p>Frustrated by the delay, opposition spokesman Cedomir Jovanovic said Monday that Mr Kostunica's supporters would give the commission two days - until tomorrow - to announce results or they would \"proclaim official results no matter what the government thinks.\" </p> <p>Mr Jovanovic said it was becoming clear that Milosevic could not accept defeat. </p> <p>The United States and dozens of European countries issued stern calls for Mr Milosevic to recognise the opposition tally and step down. </p> <p>The United States has pledged to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia - including blocking international bank loans, an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials - once Mr Milosevic accepts defeat. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, today renewed his call for Mr Milosevic, to stand down. Speaking at the Labour party conference in Brighton, he revealed that results from more than half the polling stations in Serbia showed that Mr Kostunica had won \"convincingly\". </p> <p>The foreign secretary argued that Mr Milosovic could not legitimately continue in power with \"any credibility or any authority\". He said that the only thing that would keep Mr Milosovic in control now was the use of naked power, which would be disastrous for the people of Serbia. </p> <p>Mr Cook said that the west was eager to make a new start with a new government in Belgrade. \"The European Union and other countries have made it abundantly clear that we want a new relationship with the Serb people. We want to end the sanctions. We want to bring Serbia into integration with the European institutions.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair did his best to put pale blue water between Labour and the Tories this afternoon by telling voters they face a clear choice: social commitment from Labour or irresponsible extremism from the opposition. In doing so he delivered a speech which was arguably his most \"old Labour\" since he took office in 1997. <p>Though in parts it read like Majorism warmed up and at other points like a leader feigning contrition, there was a passion and an energy to the prime minister's delivery which both reassured and enlivened the conference. Within minutes of the start of his address Mr Blair had proved that he had not lost his nerve.</p> <p>The prime minister repeatedly highlighted the differences between the two political forces, presenting Labour as the party of mature government and the Conservatives as the party of cuts.</p> <p>Significantly, he also set out what he called his \"irreducible core\": a clear, and largely successful, effort to overcome his image as a failing, rootless populist. In a passage which was presented as an unscripted aside (but which gave the appearance of having been rehearsed) the prime minister ran through a shopping list of actions he was not prepared to take but, he said, the Tories would - from \"sticking two fingers up\" at Europe to attacking asylum seekers and cutting overseas aid.</p> <p>His own pale blue shirt was left dripping with sweat after the 56-minute address, which earned him a standing ovation lasting 4 minutes and 26 seconds - one second longer than the applause yesterday for chancellor Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Today's speech was an attempt by Mr Blair to stamp his authority on the party after splits over pensions and petrol and a Downing Street \"poison squad\" accused of undermining the chancellor. Admitting that the government had \"taken a knock\", the prime minister accepted responsibility for its fall in the polls. He apologised for the Dome and made it clear that pensioners would get a significant rise, admitting he had \"got the message\" that this year's 75p rise was a mistake - though he ruled out any linking of future increases to wages.</p> <p>Mr Blair set out an unashamedly tough policy on law and order, including renewed backing for on-the-spot fines. The idea sparked ridicule when it was first floated and was swiftly dropped.</p> <p>The old \"s\" word, socialism, was not used once but Mr Blair employed a new \"s\" word, solidarity, in a passage that could apply to his feuding ministers as much as the country.</p> <p>Mr Blair said he believed in \"that old principle of solidarity, that by standing shoulder to shoulder you get more out of this life instead of fighting each other as isolated individuals\".</p> <p>The prime minister sketched out Labour's next election manifesto, promising that a commitment to raise again the share of the nation's wealth spent on schools and training would be the first line of a new contract with voters. \"Education. Education. Education. Then, now and in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>Rattling through a list of core issues concerning voters, he committed himself to action against cancer. \"Under plans we publish tomorrow, there will be 1,000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third,\" he said. \"By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research.\" That pledge had echoes of Bill Clinton, who launched his own attack on cancer earlier this year.</p> <p>There was no escape from the problems over pensions and petrol that have rocked the government in the past two weeks. A humbler Mr Blair vowed to listen but a defiant streak also emerged as the two sides of the politician competed for the support of the electorate. He promised he was listening to the nation's grievances - but set popular concern about tax on some issues against demand for higher spending on others.</p> <p>\"I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers, to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS, over extra investment in schools, over more police on the beat, over public transport.</p> <p>\"I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept.</p> <p>\"I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country's prosperity... and I will act.\" But he stressed: \"The world is full of competing causes, most of them good.\"</p> <p>One of those competing causes is, of course, Mr Blair's bid to win a second term in office and the coming election ran through his words like lettering in a seaside stick of rock. Did he do enough today to win back the electorate's confidence? Not quite, not yet - but the prime minister's speech, like the chancellor's yesterday, certainly made a good case for the Labour fightback.</p> <p>Tipped for bronze, the prime minister and his chancellor have certainly won silver this week - and if the reaction in the media pen afterwards is to be trusted, they might even be said to have brought home an unexpected gold.</p>",
  "<p>When the Olympics were last held in Australia, in Melbourne in 1956, the winner of the triple jump was Ademar Ferreira da Silva, a Brazilian who moved on to a successful career as a soap-opera actor.</p> <p>Jonathan Edwards has faced so many trials and tribulations recently that there must have been times when he felt he was living out his own private soap opera. But there was no cliff-hanging finale in last night's closing scenes.</p> <p>Under the admiring eye of Da Silva a third-round leap of 17.71 metres - the best in the world this year - blew the opposition out of the water and secured for him the honour of becoming Britain's first Olympic triple-jump champion proper.</p> <p>Timothy Ahearne had won at the London games in 1908 representing Britain but was so outraged at being forced to compete under the union flag that during the medal ceremony he shimmied up the pole, tore it down in protest and replaced it with the tricolour. He now appears in the record books as Irish.</p> <p>There was no doubt where Edwards' loyalties lay. Draped in the union flag, he took what must be the slowest lap of honour in history. He took so long, constantly stopping to be photographed by British fans in the crowd, that after 15 minutes an official asked him to hurry up. If he was determined to savour the moment after succeeding on his fourth attempt at Olympic gold, then it was perfectly understandable.</p> <p>At Seoul in 1988, as a 22-year-old, he failed to make the final, being placed 23rd in the qualifying round. Four years later Edwards genuinely felt he could bring home a medal from Barcelona but once again failed to make the final.</p> <p>Then came the magnificent summer of 1995 which made his a household name. He won at the world championships in Gothenburg with an astonishing leap of 18.29m, the first man to jump more than 60 feet.</p> <p>Many accolades followed, including his coveted BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. He remained unbeaten until the Olympics in Atlanta, where America's Kenny Harrison leapt 18.09m to snatch the gold medal.</p> <p>His start to 2000 did not suggest that this would be his year. Indeed, after a poor performance at the Rome Golden League meeting at the end of June, Edwards' confidence was so deflated that he fled to Israel to find sanctuary. But he returned to produce excellent wins in London, Zurich and Leverkusen which put him back on top of the world rankings.</p> <p>However, only days before the opening ceremony Edwards' preparations were again in turmoil. First, he was involved in a row with Britain's swimmers when he labelled them party-going medal no-hopers in a website column and was forced to apologise. Then his wife's mother, ill for a year with cancer, died after he had arrived in Australia.</p> <p>It deeply affected the devoutly religious Edwards and he contemplated not travelling down to Sydney. But, with the blessing of his wife Alison, he decided to compete, in a last attempt to take the one prize in the sport that had eluded him.</p> <p>He succeeded brilliantly. His third-round jump established a marker none of his rivals could get near as Cuba's Yoel Garcia took the silver with 17.47m and Russia's Denis Kapustin the bronze with 17.46m.</p> <p>Britain's Larry Achike, with 17.29m, was denied third place in the final round as he slipped to fifth, one place ahead of his young team-mate Phillips Idowu, who jumped 17.08m.</p> <p>\"This was a very tough competition,\" said Edwards, who had jumped further in Atlanta where he leapt 17.88m but took only silver. \"I feel very grateful with everything. I don't know what to say - I'm overwhelmed.</p> <p>\"I didn't feel good. I didn't feel fluid. I was praying like mad. I was hanging on a little bit and I've come through by the skin of my teeth.</p> <p>\"This was my last chance. I knew when I looked at the field I had the talent to win. I owed it to God to win. I feel happy for everyone else.\"</p> <p>Four years ago, in Atlanta, Edwards had been in such a state that Alison had tried to persuade him to return home to Newcastle before the final. There were no such dramas this time as his sons Sam, eight, and Nathan, five, with Edwards' mother, father and father-in-law watched the final on television.</p> <p>However, Alison was nervously pacing the streets when he achieved his ambition. \"I have never been good at watching Jonathan,\" she said. \"I'm afraid I had to go out for a walk with a friend but I was in contact with the house over the phone. He wanted to get the gold for us so that we would all have something to celebrate because we have all had a difficult time.\"</p> <p>A few hundred miles away, at the Cardiff home of Colin Jackson's parents, there were no celebrations. Like Edwards he was competing in his fourth games unlike Edwards, Jackson failed to claim the one title he had never won, in the 110m hurdles.</p> <p>The world champion and world-record holder appeared not to recover from the false start he caused and hit a series of hurdles as he finished only fifth in 13.28sec in a race won convincingly by Cuba's Anier Garcia in 13.00. America's Terrence Trammell was second in 13.16 with his team-mate Mark Crear taking bronze in 13.22. The defending champion Allen Johnson finished a mere 0.01sec outside the medals in fourth.</p> <p>Jackson, the most naturally talented hurdler the event has seen, will now retire with only an Olympic silver medal to his name - won in Seoul on his debut in 1988.</p> <p>\"Obviously I'm very disappointed but, when you make mistakes like that, you know you are going to run into trouble - especially in a high-class field like that - and I paid the penalty,\" Jackson said. \"There is no sadness. When you see how many championships I won, how could I possibly be sad?\"</p>",

  "Lord Archer was today charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice after he allegedly asked a friend to lie for him in court during his 1987 libel case, Scotland Yard said. <p>A police spokesman said: \"Jeffrey Archer has been charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice, two counts of perjury and one count of using a false instrument.\"</p> <p>The 60-year-old former Conservative party deputy chairman and MP could face a jail sentence if he were found guilty of perjury, which carries a maximum prison term of seven years. Attempting to pervert the course of justice can, theoretically, carry a life sentence.</p> <p>He was bailed to appear next Tuesday at Bow Street magistrates court in central London.</p> <p>A Conservative party spokesman said: \"This is a matter of criminal law. We have no comment to make.\"</p> <p>The charges follow claims that he asked former friend Ted Francis to concoct an alibi for him during the libel case against the Daily Star. Lord Archer had been accused of sleeping with prostitute Monica Coghlan. </p> <p>Coincidentally, the author was due to make his stage debut this evening in his courtroom drama The Accused, playing a doctor standing trial for the murder of his wife. At the end of the drama the audience is left to decide whether he is guilty or not, using electronic keypads. </p> <p>Lord Archer is expected to appear for just under a month at a Windsor theatre before going on a national tour, ending up in the West End. He was taking part in a dress rehearsal of the play today before the first show, which begins at 8pm.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Theatre Royal said: \"The show must go on.\"</p> <p>The millionaire peer was questioned by police earlier this year over the perjury allegations, which were first made against him during his campaign to become mayor of London. </p> <p>He visited a Wimbledon police station this morning in a green BMW with his solicitor to hear the charges, spending an hour and 15 minutes inside. </p> <p>One photographer was taken into the police station for questioning after Lord Archer left as photographers and journalists scrambled to get access to the disgraced peer.</p>",
  "<p>Daryl Hannah is looking fantastic: clear skin, sparkly eyes, glossy hair, not a day over 30, though she's just months away from the big four-oh. She's pale, but then she always has been. Let's just say that she shines . You'd never guess that a couple of hours ago she was throwing up in a theatre toilet. </p> <p>\"It's the second day I've been ill in a fortnight,\" she says. \"All I've eaten today is a banana, and I couldn't even keep that down.\" She gulps and looks worried. Perhaps I do too, because she leans over and touches me on the elbow. \"You won't catch it,\" she says with exaggerated concern. \"I promise I won't kiss you.\" </p> <p>Hannah has spent the afternoon rehearsing George Axelrod's 1950s comedy The Seven Year Itch, not just her West End debut but her first ever stage role. With a week to go until previews, rumours are flying. The producer has hinted she may strip off to play the lusted-after girl-next-door, and some imaginative soul has claimed that Hannah is \"channeling\" the ghost of Marilyn Monroe, who played the same part in Billy Wilder's film version. Not only is the deceased blonde bombshell giving Hannah hints about her acting; she's telling her the winning lottery numbers. </p> <p>After the frenzy over Nicole Kidman baring all for theatregoers in The Blue Room, followed by Kathleen Turner and Jerry Hall in The Graduate, Hannah knows there's no chance of the critics forgetting to turn up on her first night. \"Everyone keeps warning me,\" she says. \" 'In England they're so mean. They're so hard-core. The press is out of control.' Everyone says I shouldn't even bother reading the reviews because they're so horrible.\" </p> <p>So is it nerves that are making her ill? There was never any question of her appearing naked, she says: that suggestion was just \"a cheap and cheesy way to sell tickets\". But she feels exposed all the same. \"Being in front of an audience for the first time will be the scariest thing. I just hope I get through it and don't embarrass anybody. I missed a whole section of the script during the run-through today. What if that happens in a week's time? What if I freeze or panic?\" She has prescribed herself ginkgo biloba to improve her memory, but says she keeps forgetting to take it. </p> <p>She doesn't seem paralysed by the danger - more anxious and thrilled, like someone watching a horror movie. But still. With more than 30 films under her belt, why did she want to try her luck on stage? \"I'm not sure I did really,\" she says. She was talked into it by the play's director, Mike Radford, who had just finished bossing her around in Dancing at the Blue Iguana, his recently completed movie about strippers. \"I was so honoured that he wanted to work with me so soon afterwards. But I still said no. Then I realised this might be the only time I'll ever have the chance to do something like this.\" </p> <p>Does she go to the theatre a lot? \"Not that often,\" she admits. </p> <p>When Hannah was a teenager, she couldn't even get into the high-school play. Now she's the show's main selling point. The posters have just gone up on Shaftesbury Avenue: there she is in profile, looking unusually buxom in an underwired bra. \"Yeah,\" she says, gesturing towards her breasts. \"A much more 1950s shape. I really have a sort of boy's figure.\" As a kid she was known as Broomstick. </p> <p>She makes this West End business sound very spur-of-the-moment. But Hannah has being trying to reinvent herself since the early 1990s. Her first big role, in Ridley Scott's 1982 movie Blade Runner, cast her as a homicidal android sex slave and won her a certain cult following; but she really made her name two years later in Splash, Ron Howard's charming updating of the Little Mermaid story, which stuck her in a fish tail opposite Tom Hanks. Oliver Stone put her in Wall Street (1987), his study of capitalist greed, Steve Martin wooed her in the romantic comedy Roxanne (1987), and she even got a chance to act dowdy alongside Dolly Parton in Steel Magnolias (1989). But she was heading for a string of forgettable features and kooky comic eye-candydom. Just the title of her 1993 telemovie tells all you need to know: Attack of the 50ft Woman. </p> <p>By the early 1990s she was known more for her boyfriends than her career. After a violent argument to which the police were called, she left the rock singer Jackson Browne and began a relationship with John F Kennedy Jr that was to last three years. She would never talk about it, but that didn't stop the speculation about pregnancy, impending marriage and Jacqueline Kennedy's fury/ indifference/delight about her son's actress girlfriend. When a passer-by filmed the couple kissing on their doorstep for an impressive 16 minutes, the footage was broadcast coast to coast. </p> <p>She's obviously bright, but it wasn't her brain that was used to promote her movies. \"I would only do photoshoots, because I was too afraid to talk in person on TV, and they'd always dress me up like some glamourpuss. But that's not really who I am.\" Sitting in a restaurant booth in her T-shirt and denim jacket, a large fake-fur shoulderbag beside her, she looks more like a midwestern teen. \"I don't like to be a ball-breaker, you see. It's in my nature to be a little acquiescent.\" </p> <p>With many of her movies, she knew before filming was over that she'd never want to watch them. \"I always took the best of what I got offered,\" she says with a smile, \"but most of it was crap.\" </p> <p>She doesn't sound bitter about it, but she's not the ranting sort. \"I come from Chicago, and people from there tend to be pretty grounded. It's the centre of the country - they aren't as flighty as Los Angelenos or as frenetic as New Yorkers. And I never bought into that whole star thing. I realised early on that success is just a matter of fortitude and luck, and so I never took it personally. </p> <p>\"Maybe if I'd burst on to the scene with some Merchant Ivory film I'd have had a different career,\" she muses. Instead, what stuck in minds was Splash. Before she arrived at the restaurant, one of the waiters fishtailed his hand from side to side and asked if she would be swimming in. </p> <p>Another door opened in 1994 when Hannah booked herself into a course in film production at New York University. Her homework, a 12-minute short called The Last Supper, was shown in film festivals around the world. The New York Times described it as one of the best films at Sundance. In Berlin it won the jury award for best short. </p> <p>\"I really did the course to learn about cinematography,\" she recalls. \"I've noticed from working on films that no matter how shitty the movie is, the cinematographer is always an artist. They always try to make something beautiful. </p> <p>\"What I didn't expect was that I'd like directing and writing as well. Writing has always been a real struggle for me, and I've worked with so many hack directors that I didn't think that was a creative position. But on the course I realised that it can be if you take that upon yourself. Every single decision matters, whether it's what colour the paint on the walls is, or what the costumes are, or what angle to look at the scene through. I loved every second of it. I felt very calm and very centred and very much like I knew what I was doing, which I was surprised by. I felt comfortable.\" </p> <p>Once the play has finished its run, she'll go back to her wilderness home in the Rockies, a solar-powered affair with a stream in the living room and grounds for her horses and the stray animals she has adopted. There may or may not be room for a man; she doesn't give much away. \"The basic tenet of a love relationship is that it's intimate,\" she insists. \"It's between two people - not you, the other person and the world. I've never really felt comfortable discussing it. Plus, as I'm sure every body knows, personal life is always in a state of growth or flux.\" She giggles. \"Say one thing and the next day it may be a different story.\" </p> <p>Anyway, she'll find the time to finish off her second movie, a feature-length documentary based on the interviews she did while researching her part in Dancing at the Blue Iguana. She's hoping to submit it to Sundance; there are more projects to follow. </p> <p>Might she be a better director than the \"hacks\" she has worked with? </p> <p>\"Definitely. And that's weird, because I'm not a person who brags about things. It's been ingrained into me to be self-deprecating.\" True to form, she starts to stumble over her words. \"But I have a very strange confidence about, er, I guess, my ability or not my ability but I guess more my desire and my, um, my ideas in that area. I just have a feeling that I'll be very good at it.\" </p> <p>The bill arrives; Hannah has eaten a whole poppadom and so far it seems inclined to stay down. There's no sign of the taxi that is supposed to be picking her up, and she asks if I'll walk her back to her flat. She's fascinated by Soho's Friday-night bustle, by the crowds drinking outside the pubs, by the bicycle rickshaws. She seems invulnerable as she threads her way through the promenaders. I think of Pris, the android she played in Blade Runner - bright and deadly and larger than life. And then she becomes confused about the route and begins to wobble. \"We might have to find a dark alley,\" she says. \"I hope you're not one of those people who throw up just because someone else does.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow is Saturday. At least she'll have the weekend off to get rid of whatever's squatting in her stomach. </p> <p>\"Oh no,\" she says. \"Rehearsals in the morning, fittings in the afternoon. I have to go in or we'll never be ready in time.\" </p> <p>Oh yes: The Show Must Go On. Her stage debut, and already she knows the golden rule. </p> <p>\u0095 The Seven Year Itch is previewing at the Queen's Theatre, London W1 (020-7494 5040), from next Monday.</p>",
  "<p> I 'm beginning to suspect that I just cannot cope. I know I'm supposed to be having an awful time, I know that it's part of the job and it's not as bad as it used to be (every doctor over the age of 50 is proud to point that out), but this is real, this is me, I'm a real person and eight weeks ago I was a normal person and now I feel lost and alone and afraid and incompetent and out of my depth and despised for it. </p> <p>The house officer on the next ward got a urinary tract infection last week from under-hydrating herself: what kind of ridiculous job do I have when the best advice your colleagues can offer is to eat whenever you possibly can, because you never know what might happen next, and make sure you watch your urine output? She treated herself with Augmentin (a sledgehammer) and was delighted to find that her patients weren't the only ones reporting mucous diarrhoea as a side effect. Experiences like this can teach us all an important lesson about taking drugs seriously (junkies kindly take note, and stop waking me up at three in the morning to ask for pethidine which you obviously don't need). </p> <p>God, it's so tough. I get things wrong: I forget to do things, I run through the patients in my head when I'm in the cinema and compulsively phone the ward from my mobile to check I haven't messed anything up and killed anyone (come on, I'm being hysterical, not one of them is really that ill). No matter how many lists and counterlists I write in my little file, I always mess something up - only little things, honestly teeny things, like pursuing a scan report that would arrive by itself in two days anyway, but it makes me feel like an blubbery idiot on the verge of bursting into tears when my consultant asks me for results on the ward round and I just don't know them. </p> <p>Of course I don't know them, I have to look them up. Nobody knows them, everybody has to look them up. How can I begin to expect you to understand how low I've been feeling when I don't even believe my fellow house officers? I whinge and moan and they all tell me it's the same for everyone, but I just can't believe it. </p> <p>So have I become moody? Do I snap? No. I have reinvented myself as a slightly hysterical over-friendly ball of energy who dashes from one patient to the next repressing my anxiety and fear, multi-tasking like Shiva on amphetamines with three drug charts six blood forms and five sets of notes spread across my six pairs of hands, and I've been thinking about fitting my white coat (which I still love to pieces) with a few huge auxiliary pockets and a shoulder-mounted tank of nebulised Ventolin to spray onto the endless stream of asthmatics who pile in through casualty. </p> <p>At least the heating's working now in my crappy hospital room, even if the radiator is burning hot and attached to the only wall long enough to have a bed against it (and I still need to close the door to open the wardrobe and pull out another unironed shirt). Fatigue enhances the effects of the cold and I still need to keep the window open to fumigate the airborne residue left behind by my stinky predecessor. Right now I'm shivering in two jumpers and trying to believe it's not just the caffeine. </p> <p>The worst of it all was when my research registrar spent three whole days systematically pointing out to me and the consultant how shit I am at my job, before buggering off to some clever conference and leaving me alone on the ward with 30 patients. By my maths (and I've only been a doctor for two months) someone with eight years experience has precisely 52 times as much experience as me. His behaviour is exceedingly uncool. </p> <p>So, in the military hierarchy of medicine I have resorted to the only form of catharsis available to me, and started taking it out on anyone I can find who is more junior than me. You think I've been bullying nurses? God, you're sick. I mean medical students. But even they seem to know more than me. I give up and take them to see a guy who lost his memory when he lost his liver (booze) and has now started confabulating. He doesn't have a clue what's going on around him but fills in the gaps with some rather imaginative nonsense, with an answer to everything. (\"Sound familiar, Michael?\" asked my registrar when he first demonstrated the phenomenon.) </p> <p>The patient refuses to play ball, however, and seems perfectly oriented until I shrug and lead my troops away from the bed. \"Oh, and when are we docking, Captain?\" he asks. Quite.</p>",
  "<p>Mothers are now programmed to believe that everything they do affects the welfare of their children - for better and for worse. Plenty of chat and the right stimuli as babies will make them more intelligent in later life; cruel words or neglect may land them in therapy or turn them into criminal delinquents. Smoking and alcohol are well known health risk factors for babies. A deficiency in folic acid in the first few weeks of a foetus's life can cause neural damage and even spina bifida... and so on. </p> <p>Now, a spate of research into the effects of diet on a woman at about the time of conception is ladling on yet more guilt before she even gets to shag the dad. It seems that a woman's health and diet in the hours before and after conception - before she may even realise she's pregnant - appears to have a profound affect on her baby's long-term health. </p> <p>Research findings from the University of Southampton, released last week, suggest that female rats briefly starved of protein shortly after conception have offspring with a higher rate of defects. Their female offspring are underweight at birth, while the males have high blood pressure, shrunken livers and enlarged kidneys. Research at Queen's University in Belfast, also released last week, suggests that the official advice of four units of alcohol per week for pregnant women may be under-cautious, for the mildest tipple may affect the foetus's nervous system. Research at St Thomas's Hospital in London, released earlier this month, seemed to show that eating too much fat and too little protein can create cardiovascular disease, regardless of how healthily the child lives after birth. Yet more research, from the University of North Carolina, has shown that gum disease can be as harmful to an unborn child as smoking regularly, for women with severe gum disease are seven times more likely to have a premature baby with low birth weight than those without. </p> <p>Then there is the rather thorny issue of toxins - harmful chemicals in the environment, pesticides, additives and hormones in our food - that build up in a woman's fat tissues over the years and get passed onto the foetus through the placenta and to the baby in breast milk. According to the World Health Organisation, people should ingest a maximum of 10 nanograms of polychlorinated chemicals and dioxins a day. Yet babies in western Europe, at two months old, are taking in on average 170 nanograms a day from their mothers' milk. (Natural birth advocate Michel Odent has devised a detoxifying regime for prospective parents to maximise the health chances of their as yet unconceived child.) </p> <p>Clearly there is bound to be a link between the diet of a mother and the health and welfare of her unborn child when she is manufacturing another human being. She \"eats for two\", with the growing foetus hijacking valuable nutrients such as calcium away from the mother to ensure its own healthy development. But how are women to differentiate between what may be significant and irrelevant when they understandably do not want to do anything that may harm their unborn child? </p> <p>Firstly, the experiments on protein deficiency were carried out on rats and there is no guarantee that we behave in the same way. Secondly, most of this research has been conducted on small samples and is by no means conclusive. Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, everything we do or consume and perhaps even feel is bound to have some sort of an effect on growing children but if we stop to analyse all this and attempt to control it we drive ourselves mad with self reproach and risk, reverting to the dark old ages of superstition. My grandmother always maintained that my mother was born with a missing ear lobe because a bullet had grazed her own ear when she was pregnant. However, that perverted gene has jumped a generation and affected one of my nieces proving, perhaps, that the cause lay elsewhere. </p> <p>Living beneath an electricity pylon or near a nuclear power plant may increase the chances of cancer. Walking through busy streets in all likelihood increases respiratory diseases and asthma. Driving a car through rush hour traffic or working in a stressful job must raise a pregnant woman's blood pressure and any form of emotional distress will provoke adrenalin in both mother and baby. But this is modern life - we cannot avoid potential dangers and live enveloped in cotton wool. It won't be long before scientists find a tenuous link between excessive consumption of chocolate biscuits and hair loss or jogging and the shape of a babies nose. Diet in pregnant women is more balanced today than it has ever been. Babies are born fatter and healthier than ever, and more survive until adulthood than ever before in history. We know more about their nutritional needs, but we still indulge them with packets of fat-laden crisps, yoghurt pots heaving with unnecessary sugar and junk food riddled with additives. How can science disentangle genetic factors and the unhealthier ways we live our lives from the effects of a pregnant woman's behaviour on her unborn child? There is no way of knowing how many health problems are genetically programmed and beyond our control or the direct result of diet in pregnancy. This thirst for research into the impact of maternal behaviour on the foetus may equip some women with greater knowledge about how best to safeguard her baby's interests but the net effect is yet more guilt, as well as an uneasy sense that one can control the whole process of reproduction. Yet so much of it is still mysterious and down to chance. </p> <p>Clearly, any woman longing for a child wants to maximise the health and safety of her unborn child. But the danger is that there is so much that is beyond her control that all she may be left with is an encroaching sense of inadequacy, and what sort of start does that give to mother and child? Mother's matter, a great deal. If this research genuinely empowered them to be better mothers without cranking up all those feelings of guilt and inadequacy then it would be genuinely useful. But we're human too - and fallible. We all need that odd drink to lift the spirits, a bag of chips or a bar of chocolate for occasional comfort, and often pregnant women smoke because life is tense and stressful rather than the calm oasis that medical researchers and natural birth activists maintain it should be. Women do not exist just for the sake of reproduction. They live with the stresses and conundrum of modern life and inevitably they pass some of that on to their children.</p>",
  "<p>Winter: World Trade Organization riots in Seattle. Spring: World Bank/International Monetary Fund standoffs in Washington, DC. Then the May Day clashes in London and Berlin. I watch the escalating rhetoric, arrests and police crackdowns from South Africa with a touch of irony. The BBC shows large groups of comfortable, educated protesters violently confronting and challenging the legitimacy of smaller groups of equally well-nourished trade leaders, industrialists, agency heads and finance chiefs, all over the aid or agony global capitalism brings to nations like mine.</p> <p>As one who spent three decades exiled by and agitating against a country that did not recognize my vote, I fully support dissent and the freedom to express it. As one who has spent half a decade helping lead that country, I share the frustration when dissent and expression regress from a means into merely an end, smothering the message in the process. But from both perspectives, I wonder: Why not cut out the middle men and take the debate over globalization directly to third world cities like Sri Lanka, Brazil, Egypt, or Vietnam? Why not, to make it interesting, lock both sides indoors, face to face?</p> <p>I ask these questions not to be churlish, but for three reasons: </p> <p>First, these relatively poor places are precisely where the debate on \"global development\" - defined either in terms of McDonald's and Monsanto or agricultural subsidies and debt forgiveness - matters most. Second, their impoverished people - one billion lacking reliable tap water, two billion without electricity - are those for whom both sides claim to speak with authority. Lastly, over the past 18 months, one multinational authority tackled exactly these issues, in exactly these places, on the ground, and with surprisingly productive, nonviolent results. When chaotic protest becomes the norm in Europe and America, such pockets of calm are breaking news. </p> <p>That 'multinational authority' is the narrow-mandated, tight-staffed and short-lived World Commission on Dams. Born in controversy, it was established in 1998 - by globalization's protagonists and antagonists alike - to assess a critical aspect of international development and investment: which, how, where and why earth's 45,000 large dams have either worked or failed to deliver as expected. To do so, it analyzed seven dammed river basins under a microscope; studied the experience with dams in Russia, China and India; and evaluated trends through a cross- check survey of 150 dams worldwide. </p> <p>Based on the distilled evidence from this global review, the WCD will make authoritative recommendations and set rigorous criteria and guidelines for the construction, operation, overhaul and even decommission of new and existing dams.</p> <p>Which all sounds harmless enough. But the process can feel like putting out fire with gasoline. No natural resource, even gold, is more precious to any given country than its water. And no public tool has been more widely and controversially used for parting - and imparting - those water, than dams. Decisions over dams are decisions over sanitation. Crops. Drinking water. Health. Electricity. Flood control. A nation's future. </p> <p>Dam building is a $42 billion a year industry. In recent decades it has forced 4 million people from their homes each year; or roughly 11,000 per day, 450 every hour, 8 per minute. Not surprisingly, conflicts between governments building dams and people affected by dams have resulted in violence, occupation and alienation; conversely, there have been attacks on governments when dam projects were cancelled. In time of scarcity, dams are even believed by some leaders to have the capacity for triggering wars between nations sharing the same river. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I chair the Commission. But I agreed to do so only after ensuring that, unlike so many self-perpetuating bureaucracies, our office would shut itself down, lock up and disband after fulfilling its two-year mandate this November.</p> <p>I back our mandate, but there are tense moments when I take comfort in our limited life span. Like when things grow suddenly testy between one commissioner who has spent his life engineering large dams around the world and another who has devoted her life to stopping one. Or when, starting on December 10, 1998, two hundred pro- and anti-dam forces from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal converged upon our first meeting in Colombo, with a real potential to explode. Instead, we sat the protagonists opposite each other and asked them to explain to the Commission, in words of one syllable, their opposing perceptions. First, that dams, if done right, are critical tools for governments to use. Second, that over-centralised planning can devastate nature, cut off water that had been the lifeblood of villages for generations, and flood religious, cultural sites and homes with minimal concern for those affected.</p> <p>To be sure, there were heated moments. Government officials spoke passionately of growing populations, increasing demands for food, power and drinking water, national development goals and their responsibility to the people. </p> <p>Affected peoples talked equally passionately of their villages being destroyed, of resettlement in inadequate sites and the impersonal nature of the State when faced with real people living real lives with little food security and real livelihood risks.</p> <p>For three full days they talked. We listened. We absorbed a clash of perspectives. And we built on common ground, noting and respecting divergences. We made progress if only due to the fact that people felt they finally had the chance to put their case in a neutral arena, and that the Commission had listened to all sides. No crackdowns. No arrests. </p> <p>But perhaps that was just beginner's luck. </p> <p>In Sao Paolo, Brazil, on August 11, 1999 we had no sooner banged the gavel than word came that our meeting would quickly be overrun by nearly a thousand people who had been displaced by dams in Brazil. They had not been invited, but were moments away. Should we contact the police? Disband? Instead, we welcomed most of them inside, while the rest queued peacefully, sat listening to the debate and departed as quietly as they had come, their points made, listened to, and documented. </p> <p>In Cairo, December 8, 1999 we had to grapple with the delicate Middle Eastern politics of trans-boundary waters between Turkey and Syria, Jordan and Israel, and even protests from people directly affected by dams financed in large part by South Africa where I was Minister for water affairs. Again, we left unscathed, having brought both sides closer together.</p> <p>By Hanoi, February 26, 2000 we wrestled with the delicate Asian dynamic of complex relations between governments and civil society movements, some of whom are persona non grata at home and abroad. Yet once again we found acceptable ways for them to make their views heard and ensure that all sides of the debate are on the table. </p> <p>No one party was excluded. Ever. For exclusion breeds resistance. We can and do recognise divergence, but above all we must provide a neutral, free and ordered space, where violence is replaced by verbal debate, shouting by listening, chaos by calm.</p> <p>There is nothing novel to this approach; it is just rarely tried on the scale of a global theater. Also, few other institutions are small, finite or focused enough to attempt this. But it goes beyond a method soothing tensions to a standstill; it seeks to harness the dynamic forces out there, enfranchise them toward a mutually acceptable solution that lets all parties move forward, and turn them into forces for change, rather than merely blind resistance.</p> <p>Critics, from both sides, have cited the World Commission on Dams as a model for resolving disputes over globalization. That's flattering, but much too early to say. We have merely managed to take the debate off the streets, and clear one small patch of political ground over which the terms and conditions of a key dimension of global capitalism - imparting the wealth of water - can be negotiated. </p> <p>A parting warning: doing so is never a neat, organized, tidy concerto. More often, the process becomes a messy, loose-knit, exasperating, sprawling cacophony. Like pluralist democracy, it is the absolute worst form of consensus buildingexcept for all the others.</p> <p>Kader Asmal, South Africa's minister of water affairs and forestry under Nelson Mandela, and now education minister, chairs the World Commission on Dams. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dams.org\">World Commission on Dams</a></p>",
  "<p>Question: So what have you been doing since getting out?</p> <p>Answer: Since I left I've been staying a lot in my flat, lying low. I've seen lots of people going out here there and everywhere and I thought, no. I just wanted to go home, and be at my home, just chill and relax.</p> <p>Question: Why did you want to do that, rather than go out and celebrate?</p> <p>Answer: I didn't want to go to those big parties you see [the other contestants] all being filmed and photographed and I thought I've had enough of that, you know, almost drove me mad for 10 weeks. Even though C4 offered security because apparently everyone\u0092s homes was being bombarded by the media... you know, ours wasn't! No one was bleeding interested! I was like: no I don't want any security, I don't want anybody at all around.</p> <p>Question: So why are the others behaving so differently? </p> <p>Answer: I think it's just so tempting, they know they're going to mingle with the stars. it's from one extreme to the other, and fair enough when I was in the house I was dreaming of going to the party and having pints and whatever. it's an extension of the personalities as well, the people who are going out, know what I mean, were the ones, even in the house, who wanted attention</p> <p>Question: This all begs the question that we were asking when we were watching it, which is, what on earth were you doing in it, cos it just didn't seem at all ..</p> <p>Answer: Me.</p> <p>Question: There was a lot of positive identification with you, but at the same time, that made us think, why does she want to be on it?</p> <p> Answer: I got carried away with the whole process, as in initially saw the Dutch programme ...and they said, if you're interested, please, you know, call us, and I was intrigued more than anything else so I thought, I'll call them. And then that happened, and then the next stage happened and then the next stage and you're like, oh my god I'm down to the last whatever, oh my god! And then finally it was like, you've been chosen and I was like, oh, I haven't even decided if I really want to do it! I wasn\u0092t on a mission to \"find myself\" or not on a mission to ... I don't know, I just got swept along with the whole thing.</p> <p> Question: And so did you have serious thoughts about whether or not you'd accept?</p> <p> Answer: Yes!I thought about it a lot. My friends were really wary of it. Tanya's sister and, you know, some of my close friends advised me not to do it. They said, they would just go over the top, you know you've been ... you've only been chose cos you're a lesbian ex-nun, and I said, I know, I know I am. I know I am. But still! They said, they're just gonna milk that, you're just interesting just for those two things. Um, and I thought, fair enough, very good point. And also ... and the press would be wicked, in a nasty kind of way. Which actually they weren't. I was just so surprised, we're just really pleased about. And I knew Tanya would go mad if I was away for 9 weeks.</p> <p>Question: What in the end convinced you?</p> <p>Answer: It's so appealing, being on television 24 hours a day, people know it was sick, it was like, attraction to something perverse! [Laughs] And, er, and that's why I did it, I thought ... I actually thought at the end of the day, you know, I dunno, the reasons why people were saying not to do it, like, you're gay, your family ... you know, you're a lesbian and it's going to make bad press, and I thought, well, that's not a reason not to do it. That's, you know, if I really want to do it I should do it, and just be a bit ballsy about it. Shouldn't stop, cos it would stop other people from applying, if there was a lesbian or a gay man who, you know, wasn't totally secure and comfortable about themselves, you know, that would put a lot of people off and I thought, no, I'll just do it. Just do it. But yes, I had doubts. It was just me going through it myself. Shall I do it or should I not do it. All the time. What about my family, what ... what will I get out of it, it's going to probably be a big flop, the s how, anyway, it's probably going to be, oh, cameramen touching theirselves behind the wall! Well all these things go through your head.</p> <p> Question: Was Tanya supportive at the end, when you decided that you going to do it?</p> <p> Answer: She was. Yeah. Absolutely. She was.</p> <p> Question: I was interested in the whole Tanya thing because we hadn't heard any reference to her, through the however many weeks it was, and then suddenly on the last night, her name was mentioned when you were in the video room. So, did you talk about her and were those bits just edited out?</p> <p>Answer: No. We made a decision, she didn't want to have any, um, publicity. She didn't wan anything to do with her, so we made the decision that I was going in and just not referring to her at all. So, hard. And I gave ... I think ... I gave the impression, I tried, it was a really difficult thing for me because I didn't want to come across as if was doing the single game, as in I'm single and I'm on TV so therefore I want to be appealing. I didn't want to do that, and I couldn't talk about Tanya, so I was just like I'll be really evasive when people talk about relationships and whatever. But a lot of people were, actually, and I think there were a few people involved with, you know, or had semi-partners or someone else, I mean everyone was quite evasive.</p> <p>Question: Oh really, like who?</p> <p>Answer: Um ... who, Mel I think.</p> <p>Question: I remember her talking about her ex a bit.</p> <p>Answer: Yeah, kind of her ex, it was never quite clear... Tom it was never quite clear, he kind of had mentioned this girl who he was seeing just before he came in, so I was like, so has he split up with her just before he came or what? You know, that sort of thing.</p> <p>Question: But it seems as though you had an understanding that you wouldn't press anyone else on the subject and no one would press you.</p> <p>Answer: That\u0092s right.</p> <p>Question: So your conversations were completely controlled in that way, you policed yourselves very rigorously, there was an unwritten code, an understanding between you all.</p> <p> Answer: Absolutely. It is weird. It's amazing how the group changed and transformed, and the most amazing thing about the group is that we all were in the same moods. We'd wake up in the morning, and would go, like, I wonder what it's going to be like today, and everyone would start cleaning just out of the blue, someone would go like that and someone would go, oh, oh, oh, and you look around and it's like 6 people cleaning, and then in the evening just everyone would either be depressed at exactly the same time, or everyone would be on such a high, and our moods were so closely linked, that's one of the most bizarre things, and I don't know why. Don't know why. But what was your original question we were talking about? Oh, the unwritten ...</p> <p> Question: Yeah, the understanding of what you would and wouldn't talk about.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: Because I assumed that for some reason they decided to keep the fact that you had a steady partner ... they'd almost edited out, but no.</p> <p> Answer: She was never mentioned. No. And what we found was that in the first week there was a lot of reference, you don't see this on the TV, to Sada's partner Raph. And that had a really strange effect on the group. She spoke about him all the time. And it was almost like bringing in somebody to the group that wasn't there, that we didn't know, and we were in this little cocoon that we had to kind of ... we were the only people we could relate to, so to speak constantly about your partner was like, um, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it, we would get ... we would get a bit pissed off. Everybody would get a little bit agitated, that she's talking about her bloke again. And maybe it was because we did, some people there did have a love things outside that they had decided not to talk about.</p> <p>Question: It was just introducing an extra dynamic.</p> <p> Answer: Yes.</p> <p> Question: What did you miss the most, apart from Tanya obviously?</p> <p> Answer: Um ... speaking to people who have known me for a long time. I don't initially let myself go. You know they all came in and they're all like chatty chatty la la la, very confident. I remember walking in, me getting out the car and seeing these people and I was so intimidated, I was like, dear Jesus, they've all got personalities! And here's me, silent mute nun walking in!</p> <p> Question: Who were the people that intimidated you most?</p> <p> Answer: Darren, Sada, Nichola, Caroline, those were ... you could see their personality on the outside. Wow, shit! Mel, cos Mel was so ...</p> <p> Question: Good impression!</p> <p> Answer: I love Mel, she's great. All the bad press is rubbish.</p> <p> Question: So you were frightened of not having anyone to relate to really closely ...</p> <p> Answer: Yes, yeah.</p> <p> Question: Anything else?</p> <p> Answer: What else did I hate? Just, yeah, going to the pub, I've said it before. just going to the pub and having a chat with mates. it was so hard ... That was what I missed the most, yeah. It was so hard not being in control. Let me think. Having control, as simply wanting to go out to the shops to buy some [whispers] tampons or whatever. You just couldn't. You just couldn't.</p> <p> Question: That must have got easier as the time went on.</p> <p> Answer: Yes.</p> <p> Question: I mean you all seemed to become sort of reconciled to living in this restricted way.</p> <p> Answer: Oh, completely, absolutely. Absolutely. Every morning, the lights came with this big, it was like kerchoom, you could imagine them switching them on, there was a big noise. And no matter how deep a sleep you were in they were just the perfect level of lighting to wake you up. So every morning ...</p> <p>Question: What, they'd switch on the lights in the bedrooms? I didn't know that.</p> <p>Answer: Did you not ?</p> <p> Question: No. So when you were all sound asleep at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, you were sleeping with the light on?</p> <p>Answer: Yeah. Lights on, everything's so, bang bang, bang. At ten, store room open, battery change, half 10, all the time people were forgetting their mikes so someone would say, please put on their microphone, you know, like, fucking hell! And then the strange things like once there was a fire in the kitchen, and the security came in and we were all out the back, security came in, 4 blokes, and we were at the back and we were like [whispers] ooh, shall we talk to them? What do you want me to say? Oh my god, I'm not speaking to them.</p> <p>Question: Cos you knew those were the rule, you mustn't, you couldn't.</p> <p> Answer: Well, yeah, but you could've. We could've tried and said, hallo, but none of us even tried. Yes. None of us even tried, none of us even wanted to.</p> <p> Question: So was that an amazing breakthrough then on the last day when you were waving at the camera man on the crane? And he waved back.</p> <p> Answer: Oh, yeah! That was the first reaction ...</p> <p> Question: And that was like the first time that you'd had any contact with the outside world.</p> <p> Answer: ... oh my god it was the first reaction. What was funny about with those men coming in, we almost didn't want them to speak cos it would've freaked us out. You know. We were so used to, you know, I've said to Big Brother it's almost like routine, what we've had here is a routine, a weekly routine ...</p> <p> Question: Right, and it's kind of comforting as well, in that scary situation.</p> <p> Answer: Yes. Yeah, exactly. And that's why were petrified when Clare came in. We were all ... we couldn't explain it, I was sick with nerves, it's like, this is bizarre, it's a human being coming in to our weird world that we've created, we had our own banter, we had our own, um, ideas of what was happening in the real world and because we'd all expressed them, they'd all kind of merged into one cos we all had this exact same idea of what's going on outside in the real world, cos we had no feedback from anyone else saying, no, that's not right.</p> <p>Question: So what were your theories about the way the programmed was being perceived? you had your own theories about that?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: What did you think?</p> <p> Answer: Oh, \u0091boring\u0092. [laughs]</p> <p> Question: That's we'd all been switching off in our droves?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I kept saying, it's only editing, that's why it\u0092ll be such a snappily edited programme cos we do fuck all</p> <p>Question: But wasn't that comforting as well, the thought that you we in there but no one was watching?</p> <p>Answer: Some of them hoped for loads of people to be watching, and I loved kind of to think the opposite.</p> <p>Answer: Who were the people who really hoped for loads of people to be watching?</p> <p> Answer: Darren. Craig loved the idea of, hey, there's lots of people watching, and loved the idea of people chatting his name and, you know, he's say to me, Anna, they're gonna love you! I'd say I don't want them to love me, just like me. That's fine if they like me, not love me. Mel didn't. Mel was really cool, she's like ... she'd be great because they'd be chatting about what was going to happen afterwards and she's like, we're just going to go back to our lives, and she'd like shatter any little dreams they'd built up. One big giggle in a way, and they'd be like ...</p> <p> Question: Did that cause a bit of friction? Did that sort of ... did you feel that put a wedge between you?</p> <p> Answer: No. We worked off each other, you know, I suppose I did like to see them getting excited about it, so a little bit would sink in. And then they would get a bit, when I say, oh, it's only a game show, we'd all get excited and then someone else would say it, so, you didn't want to let your imagination run away too much ... and we didn't know, that was the thing, we didn't' know what was going on in the outside world.</p> <p> Question: You must have heard the screams on the Friday nights.</p> <p> Answer: Friday night, we had this running joke, someone said, I think it's a tape recorder playing outside. And then, by the time we were on the final week, Darren said, well, I'm on 18 tape recorders out there. And I'm like, I'm on fucking 24 tape recorders out there. Yu can imagine us, just imagine walking out and someone pressing play play play play.</p> <p> Question: And that stuff about the tennis balls and things, you never saw any of those tennis balls?</p> <p> Answer: No. And something else, I was in a little restaurant today, and somebody said it was all a conspiracy, and I said, oh come on, and she said, the whole programme, and I said, what do you mean. She thought people thought that it was set up, we knew each other beforehand, and it was planned, la la la. I said, no, no at all.</p> <p> Question: When Nick was chucked out, everyone thought that he was a plant. There was a very widespread conspiracy theory that took root everywhere, because it was just too good to be true.</p> <p> Answer: The first week, I thought Nick was a plant.</p> <p> Question: Did you?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah cos he kept being called into the diary room. But then we find out that our microphones would break down really easily so we'd all get called into the diary room to get our wires changed through the whole few weeks.</p> <p> Question: So apart from that you harboured no suspicions about Nick?</p> <p> Answer: I was dim. I was just, I didn't, I'm so dim to what's going on, I just didn't see it. At all, at all, at all.</p> <p> Question: But you were lucky because you didn't' get shown the pieces of paper. Were the people who read those pieces of paper without kicking up a stink -- weren't they equally culpable in a way?</p> <p> Answer: Yes. Yeah. And there was a lot of anger, we had a lot of arguments after that.</p> <p> Question: Did you?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah yeah.. That kind of afternoon, turning on people. And after as well. He went so soon. People were saying, why didn\u0092t Mel and Tom shout about it? And Craig: Craig\u0092s brought it up now that he\u0092s been nominated, but why didn\u0092t he bring it up before?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,373622,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",
  "<p>Question: When you think back, what is your defining moment, what is you clearest memory, that just says Big Brother House to you.</p> <p> Answer: Waiting. Waiting, waiting for a shopping list, waiting for nominations, I was tense, I would say, 6 out of the 9 weeks .On and off, I'd say 70% I found it a strain, waiting for nomina... having to nom... who's going to be evicted and ... the difference of say the first two weeks when we had to make an effort to chat to everybody and all this noise[?] going on, being exhausted because you're like, I have to make polite conversation with somebody, compared to, um, this last 3 days of sheer and utter, oh that I'd never ever experienced anything, the last few days, ever.</p> <p> Question: You didn\u0092t look as if you were having the easiest time communicating with Craig. You all became a bit polarised, and you did look sort of like someone had hit you over the head with a frying pan. You all did, you all had a kind of glazed look at the end.</p> <p> Answer: Yes, exactly. It was because, I just didn't want to talk to anyone and so I was ... cos I was tense. I was so bored, I'd finished my books, I had nothing, there wasn't even a shopping list to bloody write, we didn't have to look after the garden cos we were going in 3 days, there was nothing nothing nothing. People say well why didn't you ... it's like ... cos there was nothing. And there was bad weather. And also we didn't want to talk to each other because why, why should we talk to each other, all we would talk about was that.</p> <p>Question: There was nothing left to say? </p> <p> Answer: Well, in 3 days time one of us is going to win 70,000 pounds. No one ever really, no one talked about that. About winning.</p> <p> Question: Why not? Would it be bad manners?</p> <p> Answer: Because then you'd have a competitive conversation, and what's the point in that, and there would be, well how do you have a conversation about, I'm about to win, maybe one of us is gonna win 70,000 pounds, like, what would you converse about, well, I think I should get ... I think you should get ... we're not going to say that, because you're aware the cameras are there. </p> <p> Question: Did you know that Craig was going to give the money away?</p> <p> Answer: No, not until, er, the day before.</p> <p> Question: What was the conversation like?</p> <p> Answer: The conversation was like: I'm telling you tomorrow night, 9 o'clock what I'm doing with the money. And I knew he was going to do it.</p> <p> Question: What, you knew he was going to give the money away?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I'd reckoned.</p> <p> Question: Where had you got that from?</p> <p> Answer: Because he always went on and said how, he couldn't talk about what he was doing with his money. From day one. He'd say hey, I'm not going to talk about what I'm doing with the money. And I wanted to say, well, don't talk about not talking. It was wonderful, I have to say, you know, he was the right winner. I was just saying this to the psychologist, the shrink who we saw throughout the programme: Craig was the right one, wasn't he, he was the right winner, he was perfect. He wanted it the most, it's what the public wanted the mostl, and he came out and he gave that money to Jo, and I was in tears when I saw it, I have to say, oh my god. Yeah. He's a star, he is, you know, he's a good ...</p> <p> Question: It was a very graceful and surprising telly moment.</p> <p> Answer: Ah, but it was perfect for the production... it was like the best finale anyone could have wanted, and it was this really decent thing to do, and the programme just like peaked at the right time.</p> <p> Question: In a way what's sad about is that it's robbed you and Darren of the glory of coming second.</p> <p> Answer: I don't want it.</p> <p>Question: What were you going to have done with the money? Did you have plans?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: What were you going to do?</p> <p> Answer: Boring stuff.</p> <p> Question: Like?</p> <p> Answer: Deposit for a flat, some money to give to people, and a few treats, and that's it.</p> <p> Question: Treats like?</p> <p> Answer: I don't know.</p> <p> Question: Was it one of those things you steered yourself away from thinking about, because otherwise it would have made it all too serious?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. What you did do was, I'm sure the other two will agree, you prepared yourself for winning so you kind of went over what's going to happen, you're going to prepare yourself going through the actions but then you didn't prepare to spend the money.</p> <p> Question: You sort of prepared your arguments for Davina because you know were going to be asked that if you came out.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I'd prepared, it was like when mostly before the evictions, sitting down waiting for the names, I would just say, Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna, so when you hear it you're not shocked, your mind at least is prepared for it. And, when Craig won, I was thinking: Craig, the winner is Craig, Craig, Craig. </p> <p> Question: So you retained a tiny bit of control over it.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. Absolutely. And then we all went on, everyday we'd all talk about how ... cos we, during the last week, none of us slept really, none of us really slept, it was fucking horrible. because, all of us would think about, opening the door, walking down the walkway, seeing what's happening, people are going to ask you, blah blah blah, so when ... I know when Darren left he was rally calm, I know when I left I was just calm it's like, I've gone through this 100 times in my head, this is what's kept me sane for the past 9 weeks, you know, opening this door, going down the walkway.</p> <p> Question: So what surprised you about the way it's been received?</p> <p> Answer: I was surprised at the interest because I didn't feel that what we were doing was worthy of any viewing.</p> <p> Question: But you wanted to go on it as an experiment, you were saying, so you were giving it some credibility in your own mind anyway. </p> <p>Answer: Yes. But because we're 24 hours of it, we lost interest after two weeks. Of course you only what you're doing, and you don't know that there's 9 other people relating, you know, and talking and doing strange things... talking and showing names.</p> <p> Question: What was the worst moment?</p> <p> Answer: Oh, crying in front of everyone, yeah. Well I wanted to leave because it wasn't enough, it wasn't worth it, I wasn't getting enough from it to stay. Enjoyment. And there wasn't that. Because basically everyone just slowed, your metabolism just slows down, you're not walking more than 10 paces ever, so you just go weerrr, everyone just goes, weeerrr, and I stayed because, I dunno, there was, I'd pick up that people really wanted to win, that's the thing. . The men were so different, such a different approach. That was really funny.</p> <p> Question: That got your goat?</p> <p> Answer: That's what, I was like, I thought, oh for that time I was thinking of leaving I was like, did they think I was such a sap? They didn't, they were absolutely ... actually they all came up to me and they were quite sympathetic and were, yeah, we think like that as well but we don't say it, you know. But then, they were so focused I thought, oh, just fuck it, be focused, like them, it's not the end of the world.</p> <p> Question: And so you bucked up.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah yeah. And you did after the first 2 to 3 weeks you're always adjusting how you approach life in the Big Brother House, all the time going, forget about this, stop, you know, forget about walking, this is what you're going to do, and you do, and your mind just goes, OK. And you train, everyone trained their brains, you know, trained their minds how to approach the situations.</p> <p> Question: Was that how you coped with everyone else in the house and fitted in? </p> <p>Answer: It was survival. A survival technique. Adapting. Yeah, adapting.</p> <p> Question: Was the point for you to get on with everyone?</p> <p> Answer: Yes. Yeah. And I think, why I'm pleased I was there to the last week was that, it means, you know, I was a success in the house, we didn't know about the public, Craig was a success in the public, and that's fine, that's absolutely fine with me.</p> <p> Question: Why do you think you won in the house?</p> <p> Answer: I don't know...</p> <p> Question: You do know, you just won't tell me. </p> <p>Answer: To be honest, I can let a lot go over my head, let a huge amount go over my head. I'm not that bothered by a lot of the things anyway. And, I do have, you know, I dunno, got an alright nature, so.</p> <p> Question: What was your best moment?</p> <p> Answer: Best moment, I used to have such a scream with Caroline and Nichola, you don't see it, you have no idea, those two ...</p> <p> Question: Stuff they wouldn't show?Like what?</p> <p> Answer: I don't know if I should say this, but I'll say it.</p> <p> Question: You've got to!</p> <p> Answer: They were so much more over the top, you have no idea. People got intimated by that and I loved that. I loved the fact that people got a little bit, oh, Caroline[?] what do we do meetings.</p> <p> Question: The blokes?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. Caroline and Nicola were out there being outrageous, and I just laughed and laughed, and just trotted along behind them. \u0093What do we do now, girls?\u0094 Oh god, when they went it was just like hell.</p> <p> Question: So you've watched the tapes?</p> <p> Answer: Some, I've only watched up to like week 5. This is what friends have recorded.</p> <p> Question: Channel 4 haven't given you the tapes?</p> <p> Answer: They are going to give them to us, yes.</p> <p> Question: They're taking their time. That's nice.</p> <p> Answer: Are they? Shall I should demand them?</p> <p> Question: Definitely, it\u0092s vital for your debriefing... </p> <p> Answer: I thought we were getting a little press pack. Well I didn't want to watch them anyway when I came out. Too boring. And then there\u0092s my hair. My hair, it was just like, Tanya's like, for fuck's sake, it's the worst bit, the hassle I've had about your fucking hair.It's just like there was two chickens at the back of my head, there was just this mat of hair.</p> <p> Question: Did you take a hairbrush in?</p> <p> Answer: I did, and I found it on the last day.</p> <p> Question: I wanted to ask about your books, you took in Wild Swans ...</p> <p> Answer: No no no.</p> <p> Question: Whose was Wild Swans?</p> <p> Answer: That was Mel's. I took in Cat's Eye, and to Kill A Mockingbird.</p> <p> Question: Two books, for ten weeks?</p> <p> Answer: yes but what you do is, I worked out the first week I would read everyone else's book, because basically they are supposed to take the books away with them when they leave so you're like, well at least I'll read something, __________ [inaudible] have other people's books.</p> <p> Question: Even if it is a Rosamund Pilcher or Richard Branson's autobiography, which had such an impact on Craig.. did you read that?</p> <p> Answer: I read 4 pages, and then I wanted to use it for ... ! (mouths \u0091toilet paper\u0092)</p> <p> Question: So you watched the tapes, and do you recognise what you've seen?</p> <p> Answer: Mm.</p> <p> Question: You don't feel unfairly edited or you don't feel that the programme was steered in a certain direction by the editing?</p> <p> Answer: It was, I'd say it was like an intense representation of everyone else and initially when you look at it you're shocked and I thought, well it is kind of what they're like but it's all pff gone into an episode. I feel Mel was unfairly represented. </p> <p>Question: They did definitely create a narrative about Mel I think. </p> <p>Answer: It's just like, oh, jealous minxes.</p> <p> Question: Do you think?</p> <p> Answer: Oh yeah. The blokes loved Mel. They were so smitten. They were so smitten with Mel, you know what I mean, and she's very much, she's cool, she's cool. She was fairly tactile... I suppose that is being flirty. Um, she very much needed a best friend for the time that she was there.</p> <p> Question: And her best friends mostly tended to be men. </p> <p> Answer: Yeah, but early on Mel did pick up that there was a lot of animosity towards her from the girls camp. Stupidly created by some girls. You know.</p> <p> Question: OK. Which girls?</p> <p> Answer: Not telling.</p> <p> Question: Apart from the Mel thing has anyone else sort of taken you surprise about the way it looked on telly? apart from your hair obviously.</p> <p> Answer: Apart from my hair and my shorts. Um, no. No.</p> <p> Question: When you did something like farting or spilling beer down your front and you just thought, \u0091well, hopefully they won't broadcast that\u0092 and then they did -- was there anything like that?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah, I opened the fridge and I farted.</p> <p> Question: When you did that, did you hope they wouldn\u0092t show it?</p> <p> Answer: No, you don't give a shite, I didn't give a shite what they put out after a while. It's just like, it's me, and of anyone, you know, if you're gonna try and hide anything, you shouldn't be on this show. You see I laugh, I'd laugh at things, I'd see the tape and laugh at my hair or I'd laugh, I look like a frump, it's so funny, I just, like, fucking hell I didn't choose my best side that bleeding morning. And it's fine. It's all fine. I'm not bothered by anything that's been put out there.</p> <p> Question: Your brother in law has written about how you suppressed your intellectual superiority while you were on the programme.</p> <p> Answer: Did he? He's a good little writer isn't he.</p> <p> Question: He is. He said, \u0091even I, devoted as I am to Anna, found watching the programme\u0092 - he was talking about the conversations on it - \u0091found watching the programme rather like performing the Australian crawl through porridge\u0092. He said, everyone was rather mystified by how little of the real Anna they were seeing. Is that fair.</p> <p> Answer: That's nice.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,373623,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",
  "<p>Answer: Yeah. I was so freaked out by the whole thing, and everyone there was talking over the top of them, oh my god, it was like, god, I haven't seen you, oh, are you all getting in with each other, have you all seen the tapes, what's the real feeling going on here, and I just didn't want to say anything to anyone because, it's such a wind down process, the fact that people were leaving, they were gone from the house and then we had to adapt so quickly, you couldn't miss anyone, you adapt so quickly and then the next day you'd always forget about the people who had gone. Everyone knows that we became the most fickle group of people ever, seeing them all there again was like, Jesus.</p> <p> Question: You'd sort of got your head round the idea that you wouldn't see them again and that was it.</p> <p> Answer: Oh yeah. </p> <p> Question: So is there any of them that you're going to stay in touch with?</p> <p> Answer: Mel. And I'd like to give Darren a bell </p> <p> Question: Have you seen either of them since you got out?</p> <p> Answer: Yes. I saw Mel today and we went for lunch a couple of days ago.</p> <p> Question: So you're getting a bit of sort of attention on the streets and stuff, but it's all benevolent is it?</p> <p> Answer: Lovely. Men going, \u0093Alright my darling? You alright?\u0094</p> <p> Question: They all voted for Craig, people like that.</p> <p> Answer: Really? Alright I'll give them the fingers the next time they say it.</p> <p> Question: Was there an element of disappointment that you didn\u0092t win?</p> <p> Answer: No.</p> <p> Question: You sure? Because that must have been ...</p> <p> Answer: I wanted to win the day before, I really thought, fuck, I really want to win, I really do, it would be lovely. And then, I didn't, and then ... I knew Craig would win, even from the first week Craig would win. Disappointment? Yeah a bit, but then you're like, what have you won, what's this programme all about, well, has the most interesting person won? has the most intelligent person won? Has the most combination of all? You know. Do I want the mass of the UK and Irish public to like me? I only want the people who I think I would like, to like me. I don't want mass popularity.</p> <p> Question: What are you planning to do now? What's your game plan? </p> <p> Answer: What's my game plan? \"lot of things in the pipeline,\" which means not going to say anything or I'll be turned down. I'm going over to do the Late Late Show tomorrow night in Ireland. You have to do that. Possibly the Priory next week. And then, all these offers have come in, newspapers, and I said I don't want any newspapers, just one, that's fine, um ...</p> <p> Question: Did you particularly want the Observer? That\u0092s what we were told. </p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: You don't have to say that...</p> <p> Answer: I said, I said the Observer, Guardian, Telegraph. And I was just like, no tabloids, and then, the Observer was mentioned, I said yes that's great. </p> <p> Question: Right. So are you going to do TV presenting?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah, well not TV presenting, there's maybe a couple of documentaries that have come in, that they're interested in me doing, which is nice. Yeah, me infront of a camera. Not being all ... I'm not a personality that would go down well on TV I think. Just ... stuff that I'm interested in.</p> <p> Question: Right. Are they comedy things or a series or ...</p> <p> Answer: Um ... I don't know if I should say.</p> <p> Question: Give me a vague hint</p> <p> Answer: Kind of I suppose factual look at certain different cultures and life, that sort of thing, and commentary on ... and going away to places and ... etc.</p> <p>Question: So what about the music stuff, is that something that you've going to pursue?</p> <p> Answer: I wanted to but there's very little scope, seemingly, for following up the music.</p> <p> Question: Was this a surprise? Disappointment?</p> <p> Answer: A wee bit, yeah, a wee bit. Television wise there's very little music coverage on television. It's bizarre, but, and there's a chance of a slot on a radio station, having a little show, where I talk rubbish everyday! That would be great!</p> <p> Question: Is that in London or ...</p> <p> Answer: Yeah yeah. Not a mainstream station. I don't want a recording thing.No. I'm not that good, really I'm not.</p> <p> Question: I wouldn't have thought that would have bothered a lot of producers though</p> <p> Answer: Yeah, some of the others have been offered recording contracts.</p> <p> Question: I can't wait to hear Nichola's.</p> <p> Answer: Have you not heard it?</p> <p> Question: No. Have you?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: What do you think?</p> <p> Answer: It's OK. IT is, it's very \"well produced\" [giggles]</p> <p> Question: Did you know that Big Brother was going to be a sort of springboard to other things</p> <p> Answer: No.</p> <p> Question: You must have had a sense you had of an opportunity to kind of audition yourself for a complete change of career.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. What we all decided, see, I had an idea, we were talking about, um, what is the link, what is the connection that we all have, and it came out that everyone wanted to change their life somehow, and, they wanted to go back to their life but just wanted time to have time away from it, or, really think about how their life has gone so far because if you're basically really content and happy, hour job, your life, your family, you're not gonna do this show, what's the point. so it was all like 11 people who just wanted to give themselves a right old kick up the ass, a real shock, and then, come out the other end, see what would happen. That was it, you'd come out and just see what would happen. A failure or a big success, you might have had time away to decide what you really want to do with your life, and, it was inspiring, chatting to some of the people there about what they'd done on their travels. I know Tom was really taken, Tom was really inspired to change his life himself, regardless of what was happening afterwards. And you learnt a lot, and I know Darren learnt a whole lot. You would hear so many funny stories from Nichola and Caroline about what they got up to, whether they're clubbing up or whatever, I mean they were outrageous. And he couldn\u0092t believe his ears. He's so intriguing because he's one of the most mature people I've ever, ever met, and he is also such a little kid. Doesn't know anything. So unworldly, you know, yet so daddy.</p> <p> Question: So it was a complete eye-opener for him?</p> <p> Answer: Mm.</p> <p> Question: Your mother apparently never watched Big Brother, is this true?</p> <p> Answer: That's true.</p> <p> Question: Did you know she wasn't going to watch it?</p> <p> Answer: I thought she mightn't, yeah. She got hassled a lot from the press, a lot of the time. Had a hard time wiht it, cos of course she'd see newspapers and she'd sort of ... pffff When she met with Mary[?] she said a very funny comment, some sort of reference to me saying, \u0091Eileen and Kevin Nolan, devout Catholic parents of Anna Nolan, the lesbian ex-nun who said she'd bring a vibrator in with her.\u0092 And her reaction was: \u0091I was disgusted! Devout Irish Catholic, how dare they?\u0092</p> <p>Question: She's displayed no curiosity about it at all?</p> <p> Answer: No. She wasn't watching it... if she had I think she would have had back-up from people coming up to her and talking to her and chatting to her, but she always just said no, I'm not interested. She had to answer all the time to journalists, all the time. She says no, it's Anna's show, and ... and she's so happy, she's so delighted with it all, you know.</p> <p>Question: Were you surprised?</p> <p> Answer: No.That's just her.</p> <p> Question: How do you feel that apparently there's going to be a Big Brother module in some psychology courses in universities? Will you be signing up? </p> <p>Answer: No!</p> <p> Question: Do you think there are lessons that we can learn from it, do you think it does say anything important about the human condition?</p> <p> Answer: I think it says more about the people who watched it rather than the people who were in the house, definitely. Why did people get so interested? Why? Why was it so big, how was it so big? You tell me.</p> <p> Question: What's your theory?</p> <p> Answer: Um, if I could vote somebody out of Eastenders every week I would. Or whatever.</p> <p> Question: You think it was kind of vengeful almost.</p> <p> Answer: It\u0092s like having control over a soap opera for the first time. </p> <p> Question: But I think also there was a kind of fondness that kicked in, and that analogy with guinea pigs was just really accurate as well because you were all like little pets.</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: You know, we could change your litter occasionally...</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. I don't know you see, I don't know, I'm overwhelmed by people\u0092s reactions. </p> <p> Question: Do you feel a little bit sad for the people who voted as well?</p> <p> Answer: No.</p> <p> Question: Would you have voted?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah. Yeah absolutely. Absolutely I would have. I would have been gripped. It's interesting that weren't that interesting but we were. </p> <p> Question: You were conscious from the moment you woke up that you were being filmed? never forgot about that?</p> <p> Answer: You never forget, you just don't ... you don't care after a while. You hear [Sings] Billy the cameraman or whatever tripping over in the run.</p> <p> Question: There was that element of the Stockholm Syndrome that one of the psychologists mentioned about, people that are held captive quite often fall in love with their captors...</p> <p> Answer: We became so ... we'd hear a voice and think,\u0092that voice is so attractive.... the woman's voice that comes on on a Thursday afternoon, like, yeah, I'm gonna ask her out.\u0092 We loved Big Brother, and then we'd fucking hate them. They brought so much emotion, you know, so much emotion that you had, I dunno, it's like, a fixation with them, yeah.</p> <p> Question: Ttalking about the way you all basically obeyed and were quite compliant... I was watching that documentary about all the different other big brothers and how the Spaniards sort of rose in revolt after day 3 and all agreed they'd give the money to the same person in the end. Did you see the programme?</p> <p> Answer: Yes.We couldn't have done that, because we weren't allowed to talk about nominations beforehand, so it wouldn't have worked.</p> <p> Question: I suppose I mean, do you think there was a sort of national stereotype -- no one was confrontational.</p> <p> Answer: Mel was very confrontational. Very very. Complained all the time to Big Brother. We'd have arguments and she came out she made us feel really stupid one day after BB had told us to clean out the chickens, she said, what do you mean we have to clean the chickens out? the chickens are ill, we're not clearing the chicken. She flipped. She flipped quite a few times about the way we were so brainwashed. </p> <p>Question: Mel was the oneperson who agitated, otherwise you were all quite obedient.</p> <p> Answer: No, the time when we had our favourite songs. They told us, you're going to hear your songs at 8 o'clock, and then you're all going to sit down and talk about why they\u0092re important to you. We all flipped. We went in and we complained and said, we're not doing it, we were told it's a treat, a reward,but they said, you\u0092ve got to do it. </p> <p> Question: But you did it? IN the end you did have little chats about it.</p> <p> Answer: Yes.Yeah, it was horrible, I felt sick.</p> <p> Question: They had gone too far?</p> <p> Answer: They were threatening us. If you did well you got your treats. We were so wrapped around them, you know. When Nick left and we were all gutted and then we got a video, a bar of chocolate, we were like, hey, Nick who?</p> <p> Question: Oh just one last question, I like this quote of Nick saying she's dangerous because she's calculating, she's like a cobra.</p> <p> Answer: I love that as well. Deadly as a snake. Did you hear on the TV programme as well? \u0091Deadly as a snake.\u0092 Whispering. </p> <p>Question: Is that pantomime or is that real for him?</p> <p> Answer: That's real for him. He's very ... he's a strange man.</p> <p> Question: So there's no sort of real curiosity, you don't have any curiosity about seeing him again.</p> <p> Answer: No. I think he fooled us all and he fooled the nation so much more because they all absolutely are intrigued and adore him and I'm just like, Nick, you just need help.</p> <p>Question: That's what it boils down to?</p> <p> Answer: Yeah.</p> <p> Question: OK. Brill.</p> <p> Answer: Brillo pads!</p> <p> Question: Thank you so much.</p>",
  "Officers aboard the aircraft carrier Invincible failed to alert other British warships about the first Exocet missile attack during the Falklands conflict although they had 19 minutes warning, it was revealed yesterday. <p>One missile - fired from an Argentine plane first spotted on radar 180 miles away - hit the destroyer HMS Sheffield, killing 20 men and wounding 24. The Ministry of Defence confirmed yesterday that a series of sightings on HMS Invincible were dismissed by senior officers as \"spurious\" and that no warning was passed to other ships in the Falklands task force. </p> <p>HMS Sheffield, only on half-alert and with its own radar not fully operational, got little more than a minute's warning. The attack caused the first mass British casualties of the south Atlantic war in 1982. </p> <p>Yesterday a former radar operator on the carrier, David Forster, 37, said the officer who decided not to warn the fleet should \"admit and explain\" his decision: \"I want him to apologise.\" </p> <p>He said the officer, in the Invincible electronic operations room, dismissed sightings by him and other operators by accusing them of \"chasing rabbits\". Mr Forster added that he personally felt he had \"let 20 men die\" by failing to insist that other ships were alerted. \"This has been on my mind for the last 18 years. </p> <p>\"I should have stood up and shouted, 'There's something coming in, believe me - alert the fleet.' I'll always punish myself in my conscience for the death of those men. The Sheffield was a sitting duck. It never had a chance to change course, fire its chaff [anti-radar foil] or even its missiles. Remorse and sadness lie heavy on my heart.\" </p> <p>The MoD ruled out an inquiry into the conduct of the officer responsible, whose identity has not yet been officially confirmed. \"No doubt the officer will still be thinking 'if only',\" a spokesman said. </p> <p><b> Remorse</b><br> </p> <p> \"I don't think that blame is the word, given the set of circumstances. But that does not relieve him of a sense of personal and professional regret.\" </p> <p>Last night Des Keoghane, organiser of the Falklands Families Association, said, \"I have spoken to a parent of one of the Sheffield dead. He has not heard of this before - and neither have I.\" </p> <p>Invincible's then captain, Admiral Sir Jeremy Black, who rose to be home fleet commander-in-chief and an aide de camp to the Queen before retiring from the navy in 1992, declined to comment. </p> <p>The MoD confirmed the incident, on May 4, 1982, after a Guardian investigation into separate accounts from two ex-able seaman radar operators on the Invincible. The operators, now civilians, have not previously disclosed what happened </p> <p>Inquiries established that the incident was confirmed soon afterwards in the Falklands Deployment Book, a souvenir volume of recollections of Invincible's role in the south Atlantic written by officers. Circulated only to crew members in January 1983, six months after the liberation of the Falklands, it says the radar sightings were classified as \"spurious\". </p> <p>A Royal Navy Sea Harrier fighter was asked to check with its airborne radar \"but could find nothing\", the deployment book says. The Exocet hit the Sheffield 19 minutes after the first sighting by Invincible, according to its timetable of sightings. </p> <p>This crucial series of radar traces was not known to the eminent historian David Brown, formerly of the Royal Navy historical branch, when he wrote what the navy regards as the nearest thing to an official history of the conflict at sea. </p> <p>Mr Brown's book, The Royal Navy and the Falklands War, says that before the attack \"there were no bogeys [unidentified aircraft assumed to be hostile] on any of the radar screens\". </p> <p>Mr Brown notes that in previous days a series of radar false alarms had led to British warships being put on full action stations. His history says the Sheffield was first warned by another destroyer when the two Argentine Super Etendard attack planes - with top flying speeds of 733mph - were only 25 miles away. Her own radar was jammed because officers were making a satellite phone call to fleet headquarters in Northwood, London. They ended the call and spotted the Etendards on their radar 20 miles away. </p> <p><b> False alarms</b><br> </p> <p> The planes fired Exocets from 12 miles away. One of them locked on to the Sheffield. It had \"little more than a minute's flying time to reach the Sheffield\", Mr Brown says. The only warning given to the crew was a Tannoyed shout: \"Missile attack - hit the deck\". </p> <p>At the time of the attack the Sheffield's unlucky crew was \"only in second degree readiness rather than at full action stations\", according to another history of the naval conflict. This was \"in order to give the crew a short respite. Electromagnetic interference from [the satellite phone] blanketed her detection gear\". The Exocet did not explode, but its friction caused a fuel explosion which swept the destroyer with flames and poisonous smoke. </p> <p>David Forster, who now lives in Victoria, Australia, said: \"In the task force we perfected a drill called Red Alpha which closes a ship down into full action stations and battle readiness in four minutes. </p> <p>\"Men are at their radar displays or manning their guns. Most are at their fire-fighting stations. You could defend yourself against any attack. You could dodge and weave, turning at the last moment to confuse an attacking missile. </p> <p>\"I could have given those men on the Sheffield more than four times four minutes if only I'd stood up and said 'Alert the fleet' after getting those contacts on my screen. I had the time to do it. I should have been strong enough to break the chain of command, even if it meant getting my arse kicked. </p> <p>\"I have carried the shame of that day with me and will do until I die.\" </p> <p>The man sitting next to him in Invincible's ops room, Mark Booth, 37, son of a Royal Navy signals operator and now a professional golfer who lives in Buckingham, said his memory fully confirmed Mr Forster's account of the radar contacts. </p> <p>\"They were absolutely crystal clear contacts. I was adamant that they were true contacts. I would have bet my house on them. </p> <p><b> Hostile aircraft</b><br> </p> <p> \"After we reported them, they went on to a universal screen in the ops room with the symbol HA for hostile aircraft, the number of the contact and a line plotting the aircrafts' approach to the task force. A lot of people had that on their screens.\" </p> <p>But he did not recall any remark by an officer about \"chasing rabbits\" and disagreed with Mr Forster on the issue of guilt. \"We did exactly what we trained for in reporting the contacts. It was for other people in the ops room to act on that information. It is every ship's job to make the rest of the fleet aware of such things. </p> <p>\"Invincible was closer to those contacts and smaller ships don't have the same radar. Any responsibility is on other people's shoulders, not David's. If he had made a fuss in the ops room, he would simply have been treated as hysterical. I feel no guilt at all and David should not. Although we were only 19 at the time, we were very, well trained. We were very good at our jobs. We had the fast reactions that young people often have on electronic matters.\" </p> <p>The MoD spokesman said: \"David Forster must not blame himself. The buck stops somewhere. Someone else had to make that decision.\" The Sheffield incident was the Royal Navy's first encounter with low-flying, Exocet-carrying attack planes. Many positive lessons had been learned from it, especially in warship design. </p> <p>The destroyer's fire-gutted hulk finally sank six days after the attack. This Argentine success - coming only two days after the British sinking of the cruiser General Belgrano, with more than 300 Argentine deaths - doomed diplomatic negotiations and established the Falklands conflict inescapably as a shooting war. </p> <p>In May 1983, the next of kin of the Sheffield dead were taken by helicopter to the place where she sank so they could cast wreaths into the sea. </p> <p><br> <b> David Forster's story</b> </p> <p> \"As I was the long-distance air surveyor, I operated 1022 radar which covered 258 miles down to 18 miles radius from the ship. I was sitting at my display when a contact appeared at 180 miles. So I waited for the next sweep - and there it was again. I logged it into the computer and reported it as I'd done so many times before. </p> <p>But this time [an officer] said there was nothing there. The next sweep of my radar came and there it was, now at 160 miles. I reported it again. But the same thing happened. Precious time was passing us by, we did not alert the fleet. We did nothing. </p> <p>The next sweep of my radar, it was at 130 miles, so I reported it again. This time [the officer] became annoyed and told me 'You're chasing rabbits'. My mate now reported a contact at 120 miles and closing. I changed my display down to watch it closer. The contact was now at 80 miles and closing. </p> <p>The radar swept again but this time there were two contacts. The second contact was only on our display for two sweeps when it disappeared under radar coverage. This indicated that we were dealing with an Exocet missile designed to skim above the waves. My mate and I reported the double contact and the fact that one had suddenly disappeared. [An officer] told us that we were 'riding a bike'. </p> <p>Slowly the machines in the ops room began ticking away with the information that Sheffield had been hit. We were shocked with disbelief. An officer came up to us and began handing round sweets. </p> <p>I should have stood up and shouted, 'There is a fucking contact, there's something coming in, believe me - alert the fleet'. I'll always punish myself in my conscience for not having done that. But you're trained to obey the chain of command regardless. It had been drummed into me.\" </p> <p> <b> Mark Booth's story</b> </p> <p> \"I was sitting next to David. We were literally shoulder to shoulder. I knew him very well at the time. He was a very good radar operator. </p> <p>He nudged me when the first contact came in. We already knew from a contact in Chile that the Argentinian aircraft had launched, so we were expecting something. </p> <p>David was the very first person to see them. I saw them as clearly as he did. It is quite a disturbing thing to see an enemy aircraft approaching your ship. He was very nervous and could not speak, so I transmitted his message to the air picture supervisor. We definitely said that they were clear contacts. </p> <p>What he says about the other contacts is correct. The screen giving the identification goes on to everybody's screen in the ops room. There was nothing more David could have done at all.\"</p>",

  "<a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,373638,00.html\">Blair's speech, part one: 'It's no wonder the government has taken a knock'</a> <p>Today I make a further commitment. </p> <p> Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next Parliament. </p> <p> Education. Education. Education. Then. Now. And in the future. </p> <p> Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term. </p> <p> The waiting list pledge has been met. </p> <p> There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS. </p> <p> Every A&amp;E that needs it is being modernised. </p> <p> The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way. </p> <p> But we all know. 18 years of neglect isn't put right in three years. </p> <p> Earlier this year we got the money to plan for a five year record rise in NHS spending. But we are New Labour. We don't just spend. </p> <p> Alan Milburn and I sat down with people in the NHS and said it's a deal: we provide the cash, you rise to the challenge of modernising the NHS. They responded magnificently. </p> <p> Our NHS plan is something the party can be proud of. The NHS was the greatest achievement of the post-war Labour government. It was based on a single, clear, enduring value: that healthcare should be based on need not ability to pay. Some objected to that principle then. Some urge us to abandon it now. But this party, the Labour party will never abandon what was one of the greatest civilising acts of emancipation this country has ever known. </p> <p> Under the plan, for the first time a system of inspection and accountability for all parts of the NHS, with new money to reward good performance. </p> <p> For the first time, nurses and other health professionals given the bigger roles that their qualifications and expertise deserve. </p> <p> For the first time local health services and local social services brought closer together in one organisation. </p> <p> For the first time, the NHS and the private sector in a proper partnership to deliver healthcare. </p> <p> For the first time, money set aside specifically to get rid of the dirty corridors, the poor food, the mixed sex wards which demoralise patients and staff. </p> <p> For the first time, new consultants trained within the NHS, paid for by the taxpayer, will give the early years of their service exclusively to National Health Service patients. </p> <p> Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer. </p> <p> There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer. </p> <p> As things stand, one in every four people in this country will die of cancer. </p> <p> Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third. </p> <p> 295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer. </p> <p> By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research. </p> <p> Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting. </p> <p> And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004. </p> <p> Then on transport, in July John Prescott and Gus Macdonald set out in detail Britain's first ever transport plan, a unique 10 year \u00a3180 billion partnership between public and private sector to renew our transport system. </p> <p> A massive programme for the second term. It will take time. Investment. And a Labour government to see it through. </p> <p> The Conservatives have made their choice. </p> <p> They are committed to \u00a316bn of cuts in our investment. </p> <p> When they made this commitment, I asked for research on what sort of things you'd have to cut over a 12 month period to deliver on a \u00a316bn cuts guarantee. Back came the answer. </p> <p> 20,000 doctors. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 20,000 prison officers. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 nurses. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 teachers. Cut. </p> <p> Plus 40,000 police officers. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And then: 20 hospitals. Shut. </p> <p> 150 secondary schools. Shut. 500 primary schools. Shut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And we've still got five billion pounds to go. How will they get there? </p> <p> The biggest ever rise in child benefit. Cut. </p> <p> Free TV licences for 3 million pensioners. Cut. </p> <p> The \u00a3150 winter fuel allowance. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> 1200 intensive care beds. Cut. </p> <p> Free eye tests for pensioners. Cut. 250 cancer scanners. Cut. </p> <p> Half a million nursery places. Cut. 100,000 childcare places. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And just to round it up to \u00a316 billion, the country's entire arts and sports budget. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee. </p> <p> And in every constituency, in every part of this country, we will force every Tory candidate to say where the cuts will fall. </p> <p> The fourth big choice: a government with the strength to build strong communities, or a government that believes there is no such thing in society. </p> <p> Crime, anti-social behaviour, racial intolerance, drug abuse, destroy families and communities. They destroy the very respect for others on which society is founded. They blight the life chances of thousands of young people and the quality of life of millions more. </p> <p> Fail to confront this evil and we will never build a Britain where everyone can succeed. </p> <p> So we invest to give opportunity. Not just in jobs and services. </p> <p> Today we set out plans to invest \u00a3750million of lottery money in schools and community sport as part of a \u00a31billion investment over three years. </p> <p> It's a policy we have put together with Trevor Brooking, chairman of Sport England, who has flown here from Sydney and who believes passionately, as I do, that this is not just a sports policy. It's a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy. </p> <p> By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. 4 out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related. </p> <p> It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. </p> <p> Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single mothers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. </p> <p> Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. </p> <p> Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. </p> <p> Time to give them the power to impose curfews on children up to 16 and time to use them. </p> <p> Time to give them the power without the hassle of endless forms and court bureaucracy, to issue fixed penalty fines for loutish behaviour. </p> <p> Time to give offenders on drugs a choice: get treatment or lose your liberty because society needs protection from you. </p> <p> These measures require legislation. So will the new and sweeping powers we intend to give to the police and customs to investigate organised crime and to confiscate their assets. </p> <p> If they need further powers, they will get them. </p> <p> You don't beat today's drug gangs by applying the Queensberry rules. It is time the law enforcement agencies were able to do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities. </p> <p> We have increased funding for victim support, and given special help to victims of rape and sexual offences, but we need to do more. </p> <p> - They should get full information about the progress of the case. </p> <p> - About the sentence, and about the release of the criminal. </p> <p> - Proper compensation, backed by a Victims' Ombudsman. </p> <p> And, I believe that the victim of a crime should be able to give a written assessment of the impact of the crime upon them, which should be presented in open court, and taken into account when sentencing decisions are made. </p> <p> Standing up to criminals. Standing up for victims. Another big project for the second term of a Labour government. </p> <p> The fifth choice: a government that leads in the world, or a government that retreats into isolation. </p> <p> This is a world moving closer together. In money and trade; the environment; defence and security; the war against drugs and crime; even today the call for lower oil prices: strength comes through partnership; influence through international engagement. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means standing up for our armed services. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means know we are stronger with the US if we are stronger in Europe, and stronger in Europe if we are stronger with the US. </p> <p> Standing up for Britain means standing up for British jobs and British industry. </p> <p> On the Euro, standing up for Britain means taking the decision in the interests of Britain, not the interests of the internal warfare inside the Tory party. </p> <p> I believe we should join if the economics are right. At present, they aren't. </p> <p> But the choice at the election is not whether we join: that decision is for the people in a referendum. </p> <p> The issue is: do we rule out joining? </p> <p> Do we rule out even the option? </p> <p> How is that standing up for Britain, Britain's jobs, Britain's industry, the living standards of Britain's people? </p> <p> And standing up for Britain means standing up for our values overseas, in Sierra Leone, in Kosovo. </p> <p> And I say to Milosevic. You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough. </p> <p> These are the choices we make. </p> <p> These are our second term plans. </p> <p> A ten year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education. </p> <p> A cradle to grave poverty strategy. </p> <p> A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport. </p> <p> The next steps to full employment. </p> <p> This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform. The next steps on our journey. All based on our enduring mission, to offer everyone, not just the privileged few, the chance to succeed. </p> <p> And lighting our path is this belief: that today a strong economy and a strong society are two sides of the same coin. </p> <p> To succeed as an economy we develop the talents of all. </p> <p> To be a fair society, we give opportunity to all. </p> <p> The political consequences are historic; self-interest and the common good are at long last in alliance. </p> <p> Look at the irony of the Tory years. </p> <p> The Tories who said only they could manage the economy ended up with boom and bust. </p> <p> The Tory party that said it would get tough on benefit claimants, ended up spending more on social security than schools and hospitals put together. </p> <p> The Tory party that said it would stand up for the family, presided over more instability, more single parents on benefit, more truancy, more juvenile crime than any in history. </p> <p> Why? Because they offered short-term tax cuts that could not be sustained rather than investing for the long-term. </p> <p> Because they thought there was no such thing as society. </p> <p> In the world of the 80s that might have been cruel; in the 21st century it simply won't work. </p> <p> Do you know how much we save from almost 1 million fewer welfare claimants since we took power. \u00a34 billion per annum. Enough for 75,000 nurses and 70,000 teachers. </p> <p> Do you know how much it would cost to take out private medical insurance, as the Tories want? Over \u00a31500 a year for the average family. </p> <p> Do you know the cost to the British economy of transport congestion a year? The equivalent of 8p on your income tax. </p> <p> Do you know why we say this is a learn more, earn more world? Because a graduate earns 40 % more than the average. </p> <p> On your side for the Tories means nodding along with your prejudices - English language lessons for foreign doctors - you know they're not talking about the Swiss. </p> <p> But really being on your side is to be there with you on the big questions, on the fundamentals. </p> <p> What began as a moral crusade is now also the path to prosperity. What started as a belief in the equal worth of all is also a programme for wealth creation. </p> <p> Realism and idealism at last in harmony. </p> <p> So when the Tories say: we'll cut Labour's investment and give you tax cuts, it's a fool's game. We will cut tax for people as we can, but will do it in a way that lasts not at the expense of the very stability and investment on which the wealth and security of millions of families depend. </p> <p> So that is my explanation. That's why I won't take the easy way. Because that way we cannot reach our journey's end. </p> <p> And all that really stands between us and our destination is confidence. And trust. </p> <p> The confidence that gives us strength to make the choices; the trust that there is a vision, an end to believe in. </p> <p> Don't tell me that a country with our history and heritage, that today boasts six of the top ten businesses in the whole of Europe, with London the top business city in Europe, that is a world leader in technology and communication and the businesses of the future, that under us has overtaken France and Italy to become the fourth largest economy in the world, that has the language of the new economy, more brilliant artists, actors and directors than any comparable country in the world, some of the best scientists and inventors in the world, the best armed forces in the world, the best teachers and doctors and nurses, the best people any nation could wish for. </p> <p> Don't tell me with all that going for us that we do not have the spirit to meet all the challenges before us. </p> <p> For that is another choice; confidence or cynicism. All we need is the confidence to make the right choice for the future. </p> <p> Just as we did in the party so, on a larger scale, the same is true for Britain. We are on a journey of renewal. Before us lies a path strewn with the challenges of change. </p> <p> But the purpose of our journey is not to lose our values as a nation: but to make them live on. </p> <p> And for us, this government, this party that believes passionately in a Britain where everyone not just a few get a chance to succeed, and knows the Tories will only take us backwards, we now know: </p> <p> We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish. </p> <p> For it is a fight for the future, the heart and the soul of our country. </p> <p> A fight for fairness. A fight for jobs. A fight for our schools. A fight for our hospitals. A fight for a new vision in which the old conflict between prosperity and social justice is finally banished to the history books in which it belongs. </p> <p> We do not lie down in the testing times. </p> <p> We hold firm. We listen and we lead. </p> <p> We can be confident in our policies, confident in the record we will put before the British people. </p> <p> Confident that we will repay the trust the British people put in us. </p> <p> Confident that we share their basic decent instincts and values. </p> <p> Confident that we are winning the big arguments on the big issues. </p> <p> Stability. Or boom and bust. </p> <p> Jobs. Or unemployment. </p> <p> Investment in schools and hospitals. Or cuts. </p> <p> Leadership and engagement in the world. Or weakness and sour isolation. </p> <p> Our journey's end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world. </p> <p> That journey is a journey worth making. </p> <p> A fight worth fighting. </p> <p> A fight we must win.</p>",
  "<p>Go to any good secondhand book shop and it won't take you long to spot the book plates of major libraries. My trawl last week included books from the BBC library, Whitelands College (now part of Roehampton) and a major public library. </p> <p>But it's not just these institutions which are at fault. I refuse to buy anything with the stamp of my own university library because it is just too painful to buy back material over which I thought I had some sort of collective ownership. And this is just the material that gets to the bookshops. If no one wants deleted stock, then university libraries can quietly send it to be pulped. </p> <p>Shocked at the thought of the book equivalent of the knackers van? The problem of stock deletion is not a new one. Twenty years ago, starting to teach Soviet history, I began to scour second-hand catalogues for older works on Russia. As the small collection grew, a sympathetic librarian warned me to watch out. Sooner or later, he said, someone will ask why we have all this old stuff and it will be up for deletion. </p> <p>Why does this happen? The key phrase is \"stock management\". If there was ever a time when librarians saw themselves as preserving a body of published knowledge, then this is long gone. Now they are thought of as gardeners who know the value of ruthless pruning. </p> <p>This pruning is best done quietly. The librarian who has just written my own university library's first public stock management document was told by other librarians that she was just making trouble for herself. But at least it will lead to an open debate. </p> <p>What will change is another matter. There is a fundamental conflict between the library's role in preserving knowledge, and the constraints under which it can achieve that. </p> <p>Some stock management is necessary. The 10 copies of a textbook soon become redundant when a new edition comes out - or nine of them do. But the pressure to delete stock goes way beyond this. At its root is money and good old British short-termism. Only the best-funded academic libraries can afford to plan the repository and other space to maintain collections. Even they struggle. </p> <p>For everyone else, the starting point is that space costs money. This is why most public libraries sold off or pulped huge and valuable subterranean collections long ago. Now, what you see is more or less what you get. </p> <p>Libraries are now \"learning centres\", and must fit in computers and study rooms to create attractive study areas rather than maintain basements full of dusty shelving. </p> <p>Then there is the cost of preservation. Paper crumbles quite quickly, and the choice is often one between allowing magazines and newspapers to disintegrate on the shelves or pulping them.This is why so few are interested in the papers that the British Library no longer wants. </p> <p>Student needs are defined in terms of whether there are enough copies of the most recent edition of the textbooks on their reading list. </p> <p>And there is the tension between the needs of undergraduate and postgraduate students. The latter are few, yet their needs are for stock in depth, which means low usage. In many newer universities the library's research role counts for little. </p> <p>Then there are the different subject interests. Historians are desperate to preserve older material. Once gone, these items are often lost forever. And that's the problem. </p> <p>Is there a solution? The obvious one is to develop clearer and longer-term stock management policies. Plus some regional complementarity of collections with guarantees on stock maintenance and a redistribution of funding to facilitate it. In the meantime, the battle to preserve stocks is likely to continue in more underhand ways, so here are some strategies. Firstly, remember that without the support of librarians you are unlikely to succeed. Second, stock turnover is what counts. The first sign of danger is often the \"dust check\". If it is dusty it must be little used, so blow the dust off key areas. Third, if you take a book or journal off the shelf, never ever put it back as this increases the impression that \"the stock has not moved\". Fourth, set students lots of exercises which require them to handle the stock. </p> <p>And if all else fails, put a little money aside for the day when your prized area is deleted. You may only have to outbid the pulping van. </p> <p> \u0095 Mike Haynes is lecturer in European history at the University of Wolverhampton.</p>",
  "<p>Elizabethan clergy anxiously reporting to the bishop on the state of their parishioners' souls can hardly have imagined they were creating a goldmine for future scholars in a digital age. \"Ecclesiastical records may seem rather dry, but they contain an enormous amount about crime and marriage and gender relations,\" comments Allen Warren, head of York University's history department. </p> <p>Fears of witchcraft and political upheaval, traces of poverty and disease, the views of ordinary people who did not write but who reveal all sorts of views and assumptions of the time in their wills - the sort of archive built up over centuries by the archdiocese of York is now a magnet for university researchers. </p> <p>But it is not in a university library. Housed in a picturesque building in the medieval city centre, the Borthwick Institute archive is outgrowing its home and York University is keen to take it under its wing, rehouse it and make it more accessible to scholars as part of an ambitious \u00a37.5m development. </p> <p>Far from superseding traditional archives, new digital technology has the potential to bring more of them to light and make them more accessible. </p> <p>The York project is taking place against the background of a revolution in British research libraries. It's a quiet revolution - but the vision that archives and books scattered in different libraries should be seen as a parts of a whole has been gaining ground over the past five years. For researchers it does not matter if the document or book they want to consult is in York, London or Edinburgh, just as long as they can locate it. So a lot of effort is going into cataloguing collections - and inventing bizarre names for them - to create what librarians call a Distributed National Resource. </p> <p>Logically, this would produce a single integrated \"library\" covering the country - but that was \"overambitious\", according to Ronald Milne, director of the Research Support Libraries Programme, which is spending \u00a330m over three years to link university libraries with each other and with public libraries and collections. However, building a distributed national resource in particular disciplines like archaeology or Chinese is, he believes, achievable. </p> <p>In one sense York is a good example of the new spirit of collaboration. The project is linking the university not only with the Borthwick collection but the National Railway Museum archive in the city and privately held collections in the region. But the York scheme also reveals a tension between national plans and local ambition. The planned \u00a33m humanities research library for the university campus will, it is hoped, put York more firmly on the research map. York is young in university library terms and does not have the breadth of the older collections, as librarian Elizabeth Heaps admits. A library covering history, English, history of art, music, archaeology, languages and philosophy would lure researchers, building on existing cross-disciplinary activity in medieval, women's and 18th-century studies. </p> <p>\"There is a well-developed interdisciplinary culture here,\" said John Barrell, head of English at York. \"But it takes a lot of library resources to do it successfully. We have no problem getting high-quality staff, but in persuading postgraduate students that it is sensible to research here given the quality of library resources in London or America.\" </p> <p>The humanities research library will be a hybrid - archives, books and printed material, with microfilm, CD-roms and network computers. \"This is our laboratory for the humanities and related disciplines, but it is not all centred on the building and the books we put in it,\" said Heap. </p> <p>York is already talking to owners of private collections - in stately homes, for instance. But a recent furore over Keele University's sale of Isaac Newton books donated by a benefactor has made owners nervous about giving collections to universities. Heaps is adamant that York would not sell off books. </p> <p>Universities are of course eager to promote their own collections, but Milne has found that the promise from his programme set up after the 1996 Anderson Report of funding is inducing them to collaborate , even if with gritted teeth to start with. As no one library can buy all the books and journals or maintain the archives all its users need, closer cooperation and partnership has become a necessity, strongly promoted by Milne: \"Some consortia are willing partnerships, some are shotgun marriages where people went in kicking and screaming. Money is a great attraction.\" </p> <p>More difficult has been the lack of joined up interdepartmental thought and funding. Universities get money from the higher education funding councils, public libraries from several different departments. It makes collaboration complicated and bureaucratic, though it is happening. The British Library and the School of Oriental and African Studies, for instance, have agreed which Chinese resources each should collect. </p> <p>Perhaps it is a sign that librarians are taking cooperation to heart that these partnerships have sprouted acronyms by the dozen, from Scone (Scottish Collections Network Extension) project to Casbah, a scheme to identify and map national research resources for Caribbean studies and the history of Black and Asian people in Britain. The Queen's University of Belfast has scooped a couple of particularly neat acronyms. Its Planning Architecture Design Database Ireland has been dubbed Paddi; its Research and Special Collections Available Locally is simply called Rascal. </p> <p> Research Support Libraries Programme <a href=\"http://www.rslp.ac.uk\">www.rslp.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The internet has done many things to elevate women's lives to the realms of fantasy; electronic flirting allows us to tell huge fibs without the slightest risk of heartbreak (\"Yes, people often mistake me for Xena Warrior Princess, honest\") and when love goes wrong we can seek round-the-clock comfort from <a href=\"http://www.breakupgirl.com\" target=\"_NEW\">BreakUp Girl</a>, the postfeminist boyfriend advice site. Now, though, women's wildest fantasies are being catered for in an entirely different way, with the booming online literary phenomenon, slash fiction. </p> <p>The term refers to the use of a stroke or \"slash\" to signify a homoerotic relationship between two characters from a cult TV show or film. It could be any two personalities such as the hugely popular Star Trek pairing Kirk/Spock or Mulder/Krycek from The X-Files. The only restriction is that the characters should not have a sexual relationship in the \"real\" series. </p> <p>On the face of it, this looks like just another geeky outpouring from the net's lunatic fringe. Certainly there is no obvious connection between this level of fan writing and women's erotic empowerment. Yet surf through a few typical sites and something unexpected emerges: almost all the stories are written by heterosexual women. Some offer truly bizarre pairings - Joey and Chandler from Friends, Ashley and Nicky Platt from Coronation Street, bluff TV detectives Dalziel and Pascoe. The story content ranges from the sadistic (Mulder tying Krycek in knots) to the sensitive, with macho characters showing a level of vulnerability never allowed on screen. </p> <p>It is no coincidence that the vast majority of character pairings come from shows with a tough guy element. If there's a common thread running through much of slash fiction, it's that women appear to find erotic appeal in emasculating TV hard men. Take the following example, from the LadySlash web-ring, which features slash coupling Starsky and Hutch: </p> <p> \"Is it worth risking our partnership? Our friendship?\" asked Starsky. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" said Hutch. </p> <p>\"Hutch, don't. Don't cry. Please.\" </p> <p>He felt a gentle hand brush at his cheek. \"If this is a mistake...\" </p> <p>\"It's not. Trust me.\" </p> <p>\"I don't want to lose you...\" </p> <p>\"You're not gonna lose me. Close your eyes. Go on, close your eyes.\" </p> <p>Something that felt like velvet brushed his ear. He shivered again, this time with raw emotion rather than chill. The velvet teaser moved slowly down his jaw, to nuzzle briefly at his neck before moving on... No woman had ever played with his nipples. Starsky was doing that. Licking them, covering them with little kisses until they hardened into tiny buds. If he's never done this before, how the hell can he do it so well? </p> <p>This question seems a reasonable one to put to an author of the genre. Where on earth does the inspiration come from? Kitty Fisher, who works for the school library service by day, has been writing slash for eight years; her stories have appeared on the internet and in the Black Lace collection Wicked Words. \"In a way it is easier for female writers to use male-on-male characters when writing about sex, particularly the type of sex that appears in slash fiction. There's a leaning to dark stories, non-consensual sex, dominance. By writing about men, you're distancing yourself.\" </p> <p>So it's a guilt thing? \"Well, we may have crossed the century but we are still tied to Victorian morality, even if we don't want to be. It's not acceptable for women to say they get turned on by sex and violence. But it's not just about that - there's an emphasis on humour and emotion which is lacking in a lot of mainstream erotic writing.\" </p> <p>Fisher first stumbled upon slash in the pre-internet days when it existed only in obscure Star Trek fanzines. \"I loved the use of characters I already knew, the subversion, the dark side to it. A reader knows the backstory; there are so many things actors do unconsciously on screen which fans can pick up on and twist to their own ends.\" She points out that for many writers, the appeal of slash is escapism. Many friends she has made on the scene work for the government, in management consultancy or teaching. </p> <p>Elanor Summerton, who runs the <a href=\"http://www.britslash.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Britslash</a> website, says: \"Analysing why I like slash is tricky. I've always assumed that if men like watching women together, women might enjoy the reverse. Women seem to prefer written erotica, with well-developed characters and more emotion. In fact, some of the best slash I've read has few sex scenes and is not explicit.\" </p> <p>Another reason why many women are turning to the format is that the slash community encourages new writers. \"It's very welcoming and supportive,\" explains R Olivia Brown who runs the RedRoses fanzine. \"Discussion between writers abounds and it's not restricted by what's acceptable outside in the 'real' world. Here you can discuss grammar and penis size, often in the same email.\" </p> <p>She believes slash is probably an attempt by women to take control of their sexuality but many writers may not be conscious they are addressing this. \"The real appeal is that it allows us to explore a romantic relationship in which normal ideas about power and gender have no place because both characters are the same gender.\" </p> <p> It's a nice idea but some cultural theorists suggest that slash, when deconstructed, mirrors nothing more daring than the format for Mills and Boon. \"Like mass market romances written for women, the vast majority are first-time stories in which the hero and his ultimate sexual companion discover their physical attraction for the first time,\" says Camille Bacon-Smith in her book Enterprising Women, Television Fandom and the Creation of Popular Myth. To an extent this is true, though some of the longer-running series do move the action on - one recent X-Files story celebrates Mulder's pregnancy. </p> <p>Perhaps another factor in the popularity of male/male pairings is that there aren't that many inspiring female characters to begin with. Another writer, who because of her job in the civil service will be identified only as Joram, takes this argument a stage further. \"As a reader, slash for me is ideal fiction because I dislike female characters. They make me feel demeaned and ashamed because most tend to be two-dimensional. I focus on male characters because I like to lust over them.\" </p> <p>So why not write heterosexual scenes? \"There are a lot of strong male characters on TV that women would like to see show a vulnerable side,\" Joram explains. \"What better way of doing that than by putting two guys in a romantic situation? Then we can make them vulnerable and hurt them emotionally to our heart's content, and there's no need to put a woman in there at all.\"</p>",
  "<p>Privatisation has been the main policy option presented to transition countries since reforms began. Privatisation moved in three directions. Small privatisation of service units, shops, restaurants, etc; big privatisation of state owned enterprises, land and other assets; and the removal of tariffs and barriers to trade and the encouragement of private investment (including in service provision).</p> <p>The scale and form of private ownership and the processes to achieve these reforms were rarely properly debated. The World Bank did not allow time for consensus to develop of what should be privately as opposed to publicly owned or run. The rush to privatise quickly was also motivated by a desire to introduce changes before opposition to those changes could be organised. In the 1996 World Development report, the World Bank refers to this as a \"window of opportunity - a period of extraordinary politics. In which far reaching changes could be initiated with little dissent or opposition\" . </p> <p><strong>The cost of privatisation:</strong></p> <p>Also in the 1996 World Development Report, the World Bank admits that it failed to anticipate the complications of privatisation : \"Ukraine introduced a voucher privatisation programme .. but failed to carry it through effectively\"; \"The Russian programme is also an example of the serious tensions that often arise between political feasibility and economic desirability\". \"A particularly vexing question is who monitors the monitors . Supervision of financial agents is severely problematic in transition economies\" . In fact in many transition countries the privatisation process was seen by the mass of unemployed and disenfranchised as a glorified theft of social assets, selling off the country assets to a privileged few. The voucher schemes, held up by the Bank as the most successful privatisation process, were plagued by corruption. In some countries individuals and families were left with small plots of land or livestock or tiny shares in enterprises which could not be turned into productive assets. Many failed to understand the concept of privatisation after up to 70 years of public ownership and thus they failed to manage their property or even secure their assets .</p> <p><strong>The production of inequality:</strong></p> <p>The way in which privatisation was carried out has produced considerable social injustice, corruption, unnecessary social stratification and uncompetitive markets dominated by monopolies, the opposite of what was intended. Alongside this has been a widespread disregard for the protection of labour and thus mass unemployment. A simultaneous dismantling of price controls and consumer subsidies also occurred. The net effect has been a phenomenal increase in poverty. UNDP data, based on government poverty lines suggest that in some Central Asian countries, 60-70 per cent of the population are living in poverty, up from 35-50 per cent before independence. </p> <p>In the 1996 World Development Report, the Bank itself admits the importance of equity as the basis for stable society and economic growth; recent research corroborates this evidence: 'high levels of income-inequality limit the poverty reducing effects of growth high inequality countries will need to grow twice as fast as low inequality countries to halve poverty by 2015. This is not feasible'. Privatisation processes have served to institutionalise inequalities. The Bank admits that those with power: \"have been able to turn their control rights into property rights through privatisation, leaving ordinary citizens with little. This has deepened public cynicism about reforms and undermined the legitimacy of the post reform economy\" . In these institutionally dismantled economies there are insufficient mechanisms for redistribution of wealth. The descent into poverty has destroyed the middle class and left children more likely to be poor than the average person . The implications for inter-generational transmission of poverty are alarming.</p> <p>In the process of privatisation existing institutions were often dismantled with little regard for what might take their place. The World Bank and IMF advocated slimmer government irrespective of function, often failing to recognise as valid any of the varied roles government played in pre-transition society. This also negated the possibility that government may need to play an increased role in some areas, especially if alternative institutions did not exist. Instead the Bank and other donors supported a complicated and questionable process of rapid institution building in the civil society sector. </p> <p>The Bank is criticised for inadequate consideration of the complexity of the political implications of privatisation; the creation of a large dispossessed class through extraordinarily naive or simply inappropriate mechanisms to distribute assets; a failure to recognise components outside of legal institutions and banks which are necessary for entire populations to understand and trust privatisation; inadequate analysis of the complexity of privatisation, particularly of land and small asset privatisation; a failure to cope with the long term social costs of poverty and plan for phased unemployment or adequate social protection; and a failure to anticipate or understand the known social and environmental costs of privatisation in subsistence economies.</p> <p>There has clearly so far been a failure to learn with the Bank and donors continuing to press for privatisation in all parts of the economy irrespective of known failures or local contexts. As a result, the privatisation of water assets is of huge concern for environmental reasons and in particular for marginalised groups. </p> <p><strong>Key concerns:</strong></p> <p>1. The introduction of user fees in health and education and in contexts where incomes have catastrophically declined is highly discriminatory. It is essential that social protection schemes work, but so far they have demonstrably failed. Citizens of transition countries feel they are a laboratory for economic theorists obsessed with private ownership . There are many forms of ownership and co-operation of which individual ownership is just one.</p> <p>2. Blanket policy prescriptions regarding the role of the market and private ownership irrespective of local context has led to the inequality and poverty witnessed today in transition economies. The changing role of the public and private sector is not an inevitable progression towards more private and less public, but a more nuanced and constantly changing negotiation.</p> <p>3. There are still countries entering or engaged with privatisation and other transition processes. It is imperative that the lessons learnt so far are constructively used and that alternative views of ownership and more open and democratic processes of decision making are allowed to emerge. </p> <p><strong>For further information contact:</strong></p> <p>Caroline Harper, Head of Research and Development (c.harper@scfuk.org.uk) Rachel Marcus, Research and Policy Advisor (r.marcus@scfuk.org.uk) Anna McCord, International Advocacy Co-ordinator (a.mccord@scfuk.org.uk) John Wilkinson, Policy and Learning Officer (j.wilkinson@scfuk.org.uk)</p>",

  "If ever mathematical proof was needed of Oprah Winfrey's importance to the nation, it was on obvious display this week. George W Bush jumped in the space of a few days from a 10-point deficit in the opinion polls to a 1% lead, and the only thing anyone could remember him doing was kissing the country's favourite chat-show hostess. <p>That may be a slight over-simplification. He appeared on another talkshow wearing a dark shirt which matched the one being worn by the host, Regis Philbin. People thought that was fun too, but they really liked the kiss. It seemed to have the same sort of tonic effect on Bush's political standing as Vice-President Al Gore's prolonged on-stage snog with his wife Tipper, at last month's party convention. </p> <p>If anyone still doubted that the Oprah effect was truly in play in these elections, they only had to check out the breakdown of the polling figures. The greatest leap in Bush's support was among women, who make up the overwhelming majority of Oprah and Regis audiences, and who have proved to be an elusive electorate for republicans in general. </p> <p>The television analysts said Bush won his poll surge just by looking relaxed and leaning forward, looking keen and engaged. But the kiss planted on the talkshow queen's cheek might have been the clincher. When Al Gore appeared on the Oprah show a few days earlier, he had offered his hand rather than his lips, earning a rebuke from his hostess. And the vice-president had sat back in his armchair and thrown his head back when he laughed, looking aloof. </p> <p>The fact that the Oprah effect has thus been demonstrated under near-laboratory conditions (not much else was going on that might have spoiled the experiment) is likely to have a significant effect on future campaigns. The Oprah show, with its 7m viewers, is likely to become as important a stop along the way to the presidency as the presidential debates. There are likely to be Oprah trainers hired alongside the debate coaches, and they will specialise in body language - how to sit and how to kiss. </p> <p>They will also teach the delicate art of confession, which has become an almost ritual need for a society steeped in the protocols of the talkshow and the soap opera. The confession must be offered at some apparent personal cost. It must draw a tear or at least a glassy eye. </p> <p>Bush scored here. His eyes turned shiny after talking about his wife's difficult pregnancy, and stayed shiny through the ensuing commercial break. Gore, by remaining dry-eyed while talking about Tipper's struggle with depression, thus failed to fulfil the audience's expectations and we must conclude he suffered at the polls as a consequence. </p> <p>But a confession is a double-edged dagger. A candidate will not wish to imply a lasting weakness. The fault he confesses must be something which he or she has overcome and which has only served to make him or her stronger. In Hollywood it is known as the narrative \"arc\". It is built into most of the characters in film or television dramas because it provides a satisfying mix of challenge and redemption. </p> <p>Now, the electorate is expecting the same biographical curvature from the country's presidents as well. Bush scored particularly well here. He tells the well-used story of how he broke his long and deep relationship with alcohol the day after his 40th birthday in the wake of a raucous night out with friends - just about that time he found God. </p> <p>Gore suffers because he lacks this sort of an arc. His progression from senator's son to congressman to senator to vice-president has been tediously linear. Straight lines do not play well in the movies, and in the Age of Oprah they make for bad politics too. </p>",
  "<p>Twelve-year-old Aisling McCabe had a day off school this week. She wasn't sick. Instead, she was doing vital work trying to help catch shopkeepers illegally selling harmful goods to children. </p> <p> She is one of hundreds of young people recruited to help trading standards officers - the people responsible for enforcing the rules restricting the sale of such things as cigarettes, alcohol and gas lighter refills. The government supports the idea. Just this month it published new targets encouraging the undercover scheme against shopkeepers who \"flout the laws\" on under-age sales. </p> <p> <strong> Is it safe as an undercover agent?</strong> <br></p> <p> \"I felt scared at first,\" says Aisling, \"but I got used to it. We visited 18 shops and on the way to each one I was told what to ask for and reminded not to look at the officer coming in with me.\" </p> <p>There are strict rules protecting children out on such patrols. They are never alone. Officers go into the shops with them so that later they can be a witness. Children are not expected to give evidence in court. And before the trading standards people pounce, there is time for the child to leave the shop. Also, the visits take place well away from the child's area. </p> <p>According to Aisling, the only problem she had was being told off by a shopkeeper when she asked for cigarettes: \"that was horrible, but it was good too - at least she wasn't prepared to let me have them.\" </p> <p> <strong> Is it fair to \"entrap\" shop-keepers?</strong> <br> </p> <p> It isn't entrapment, say trading standards officers. It is always a follow-up to local information campaigns during which shop-owners are warned that they may be receiving such visits. Also, the children are not allowed to lie. If challenged, they must give their true age. </p> <p>The only way to prosecute people breaking these trading laws is to catch them red-handed. A survey published last October showed that in areas ranging from the London borough of Bromley, to Wolverhampton and the Isle of White, children bought restricted goods in six out of 10 shops. </p> <p> <strong> Have children been doing this investigative work for a long time?</strong><br> </p> <p> Yes, for many years in some areas. But the big increase has been since 1991, when the law was tightened to stop sales of cigarettes to people actually under 16. Before that the law covered sales to those \"apparently\" under 16. Now it is the responsibility of the shop owner to apply a \"No proof of age, no sale\" policy with restricted items. To help them, some councils, such as Essex, are distributing proof of age cards to students. </p> <p> <strong> What penalties do shop-keepers face if they break the rules?</strong> <br> </p> <p> The maximum fine is \u00a32,000. Usually the penalty for a first offence is about \u00a3200-\u00a3300. What hurts is the bad publicity shops receive in local newspapers when prosecuted. </p> <p>Often the shop-owners know the rules, but it is their staff, sometimes not much older than the customers themselves, who fail to apply them. Not that this is a defence. </p> <p> <strong> Is the policy of using young people effective as a deterrent?</strong> <br> </p> <p> Yes. In Liverpool the trading standards have been working with children on undercover operations since 1988 and have seen illegal sales fall dramatically. At the start, they occurred on 85% of visits, but now on just 5%. However, not all local authorities have enough officers to mount these operations. </p> <p> <strong> Do these investigations really help protect young people?</strong> </p> <p> It is essential to keep these items away from children, so anything that makes them harder to buy is worthwhile. Sniffing glue or lighter gas can be lethal, and the nicotine in cigarettes is more addictive than cocaine and heroin. Of course, while the children working with trading standards are not allowed to wear make-up or lie, there is nothing to stop others disguising their ages. </p> <p> <strong> What do the children working undercover get out of this work?</strong> </p> <p> \"I feel strongly about it,\" says Aisling. \"Children a bit older than me are getting into smoking and it can kill. It was exciting going undercover and the officers bought me sweets and magazines in every shop.\"</p> <p> <strong> Further information: </strong> <br></p> <p> If you are interested in helping maintain trading standards you can contact them through the local authority or council. </p> <p> The charity, Quit, runs a helpline for people wanting to stop smoking - 16% of its 500,000 annual calls come from young people, tel: 0800 002200. </p> <p> Quit's \"Break Free\" trainers also offer courses and presentations for schools.

  "<p>The Sydney Olympic games do not just represent the pinnacle of sporting achievement; they are also a showcase for cutting-edge science and technology. When the modern Olympics commenced in Athens in 1896, the results were not recorded in detail. The stopwatch and camera were first used at the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. With so little to choose between performances today, many are increasingly looking to technology to give them the edge. A 1% improvement can make the difference between success and failure and there is now almost no aspect of performance where science does not play a prominent role. </p> <p><strong> Training</strong><br> </p> <p> All top athletes are constantly monitored to ensure they can produce their peak performances on the critical occasion. Blood tests are routinely performed to check that the optimum levels of amino acids are present, cardiographs are used to monitor heart rates to allow athletes to train to their optimum aerobic potential and new training techniques have been devised by sports scientists that both prevent injury and reduce the recovery time between workouts. </p> <p><strong> Technology</strong><br> </p> <p> These days, technology doesn't just have the capacity to enhance performance, it can also change the way sports are played. Even swimming, one of the most natural of events, has been affected. Pools are now designed to minimise wave interference and to provide greater grip for kick turns off the wall at each end. The freestyle stroke has also changed from the conventional straight-arm action to a more efficient \"S\" motion that enables swimmers to move towards water that has not already been pushed backwards by the initial phase of the stroke, thereby reducing drag and increasing buoyancy. Technology is also being used to set limits on performance. Distances in the javelin were increasing by such large amounts in the 1980s, there were fears that throwers might become a danger to spectators and other athletes; the weight distribution of the javelin has now been redesigned to shorten flight times and distance and to put greater emphasis on the skill and technique of the thrower. </p> <p><strong> Clothing</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the most obvious signs of technological advances has been the changes in clothing. Every sport now has its own footwear; among the latest running shoes for track and field athletes at Sydney are z-spikes and hover shoes. Marathon runners are after the perfect singlet that will allow them to lose sweat most efficiently, while sprinters wear all-in-one aerodynamic space suits. These don't just cut drag; they can also suppress muscle vibration and save energy. The pool has also seen clothing changes; the all-in-one suit is now common and one company has produced a suit that replicates the teeth-like features of a shark's skin in the belief this may help a swimmer to move faster.</p>",
  "<p><strong> When you're ready landlord. </strong> What? </p> <p><strong> Prithee, a jug of your foaming finest. </strong> \u00a3*$@ off. </p> <p><strong> What's up, mine host?</strong> I detest all this Falstaffian alehouse crap. </p> <p><strong> Oh, all right</strong>.<strong> A pint of lager. </strong> That's better. </p> <p><strong> But I thought cheery banter was the fun of running a pub.</strong> Did you? </p> <p><strong> That's why I'm thinking of giving it a go.</strong> You're welcome, mate. </p> <p><strong> Why so sceptical?</strong> Because it's seven days a week, 12 hours a day - except Sunday. </p> <p><strong> What do licensees do?</strong> Run any of the 60,000 pubs in the UK, small and large, traditional and themed, most serving food of some description. </p> <p><strong> Busy life. </strong> Not half. Apart from serving, we're keeping accounts, controlling stock, buying in drink, food and other goods, and recruiting, training and supervising the staff. Many licensees do the cooking themselves and are responsible for the health and safety of staff and customers and deal with any security issues. </p> <p><strong> Are there different sorts of licensee?</strong> Yeah: managers, tenants or freetraders. Managers are salaried employees of a pub's owners. Tenants run pubs leased to them by the owners. Freetraders own the pubs they run and are independent. </p> <p><strong> What skills does the job need?</strong> It is essential to get on well with all kinds of people, to be outgoing with good conversational and listening skills. </p> <p><strong> Oh real...</strong> Oy! Don't interrupt. Licensees must be able to deal with any trouble in the pub and have good management skills for training and motivating staff. Numeracy and business skills are essential for cash-handling, accounts, stock control, buying, pricing etc. Licensees must be able to learn and follow the legal requirements of their business concerning licensing, food and health and safety. </p> <p><strong> Any academic requirements?</strong> No. Personal qualities are more important. Previous business experience is desirable and some bar work experience is helpful. Traditionally it has been seen as a job for couples, but singletons are increasingly running pubs. You have to be 18 to serve behind a bar, but 25 is often seen as a realistic lower age limit for a licensee. </p> <p><strong> Other qualifications?</strong> Sure. Relevant ones include NVQs 1 and 2 in catering and hospitality; On-licensed premises supervisory management, level 3 and 4 and the British Institute of Innkeeping (BII) certificate of induction. There's even a degree in licensed retail management at the University of Wolverhampton. </p> <p><strong> What about training?</strong> Some employers train their managers and many pub owners provide training for potential tenants. There are modern apprenticeship opportunities. Tenants or freetraders can do five-day courses run by colleges and training companies for the BII qualifying examination. The Hospitality Training Foundation offers some one-day courses that are suitable for licensees. Graduates of relevant HND/degree courses may be able to do fast-track training courses run by the bigger companies. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong>British Institute of Innkeeping </strong> Telephone: 01276 684449 <a href=\"http://www.bii.org\">www.bii.org </a></p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Hospitality Training Foundation (HFF) </strong> Telephone: 020-8579 2400 <a href=\"http://www.htf.org.uk\">www.htf.org.uk </a></p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association </strong> Telephone: 020-7486 4831 <a href=\"http://www.bla.co.uk\">www.bla.co.uk </a></p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Leisure Careers U.K. </strong> (operated by BII) <a href=\"http://www.barzone.co.uk\">www.barzone.co.uk </a> </p> <p>\u0095<strong> learndirect 0800 100900 </strong> may be able to give further information and advice on courses.</p>",
  "<p>It's that time of the year again - that \"Oh no, I've got to get my future plans sorted out in the next 10 minutes!\" time, when prospectuses, rough drafts of personal statements and the like start flying about careers rooms around the country, in an ever-increasing frenzy as the autumn term progresses. </p> <p>Recent discussions about a six-term year with exams in April, results in July and a post-qualifications applications system for higher education remain in the realms of fantasy. </p> <p>Now is the time to get your act together (no more phoning a friend or asking the audience), do the research you should have done last term and get that higher education application sent off as soon as possible. Even though it's 12 months before you'll start (maybe 24 if you are planning a gap year) Ucas forms must be completed soon. </p> <p>If you are an Oxbridge candidate or a potential medic, vet or dentist then the deadline is fast approaching - October 15. For everyone else the deadline is later - December 15 - but schools and colleges will have their own deadlines much earlier than this and in any case it pays to get your form in early. If it is with Ucas in October there's a good chance you will have heard from most of your choices by the end of this year and this is likely to provide good motivation for the rest of the academic year's studies. </p> <p>What are the main issues you need to address? Your choice of course and university matters most, after you've analysed exactly why you want to go in the first place. </p> <p>The majority of the evidence available suggests that a successful higher education experience is a positive thing in a variety of respects, not the least of which are the personal ones of independence, freedom, responsibility and making new friends. Many will think about career prospects, whether it be in terms of status, salary, job satisfaction or a mixture of the three. Here there is no doubt that a degree, whilst not guaranteeing anything, is going to help in the job market and gives an enormous advantage over a non-graduate. Recent reports suggest that the average starting salary for a graduate is up 4% to \u00a318,330 this year, with the best paid jobs in legal services. </p> <p>Many professions are all graduate entry, others are becoming so. For some you will need a specific vocational degree, for others a degree in any discipline will suffice. Around 40-50% of all graduate employers are not concerned with your degree subject. They focus on other qualities you will have gained from your time at university. These include communication skills, problem-solving and decision-making skills, self-confidence, adaptability and flexibility and the ability to work under pressure. </p> <p>How do you choose what to study when all your brain will come up with is a blank whenever you think about it? For some, probably the minority, this is a straightforward issue. One of your A-levels interests you and you want to take it to a higher level. Others may have a particular career in mind and need to follow a specific degree - medicine for doctors, pharmacy for pharmacists, golf course management for golf course managers etc. </p> <p>For the rest it isn't such an easy decision - but it is worth taking some time to get right. Your choice does not have to be related to a career; rather it should be something you'll really enjoy studying otherwise you'll drop out of uni sooner rather than later. This means reading and research - both time-consuming but essential if you are to make a sensible choice. </p> <p>Exploring the possibilities will open your mind to the options of taking a joint degree (two subjects of equal weight) or a combined or modular degree (where the subject combinations are even broader). There are also many new subjects available at degree level that are not possible at A-level. A cautionary note - don't mix up your subject choices too broadly (for example three physics plus three English probably equals six rejections). </p> <p>There are now over 300 different institutions in the Ucas system and choosing six between Aberdeen and Ystrad Mynach (there are no Zs yet!) can be a big task. Decide on your criteria. Are you going to stay at home? If you are planning to go away, how far do want to go? New university or old/traditional? Campus or town/city centre? </p> <p>Checking required grades with your predicted grades is part of all this so find out both - neither are state secrets! Whilst all these are important and are bound to exercise your mind, perhaps the most crucial issue is course content. If this isn't right when you start it does not matter how happy you are with your location, you'll struggle very quickly. Finance (or lack of it) will also play a major role in your decision, especially if you do decide to study away from home. Stories of massive debts on graduation are not total fiction - in the short and medium term money is likely to be tight, but in the long term the financial and other advantages of higher education definitely outweigh the disadvantages. </p> <p>It's not too late to come up with an informed and well-thought-out application even if you are squeezing nine months' research into nine days. Use the time fully and take advice from those you respect. This could be the first stage towards the best years of your life. </p> <p> <strong>The end of paper</strong><br></p> <p>Ucas are now encouraging students to apply via the electronic application system - EAS. This year 37,000 did so and the number is expected to double for the 2001 round and eventually overtake paper applications. It is a quick way of filling in your Ucas form on computer - the programme corrects mistakes automatically and avoids the use of dozens of practice forms. The personal statement can be cut and pasted on and print preview allows you to see your final form the way the universities will see it.

  "<p>Oxford university will review its marketing and recruitment to attract more applicants from further education colleges, but it won't dilute its rigorous academic entry criteria. </p> <p>Candidates will still have to get three grade As at A-levels, it was made clear to college principals attending a conference on admissions to the university from the sector. </p> <p>For the foreseeable future, Oxford won't be accepting other qualifications as substitutes for three As to achieve the minimum 30-point tariff. </p> <p>Summer schools at Oxford run exclusively for further education students were among a package of proposals to stimulate more interest in the sector and remove widespread prejudice there against the university. </p> <p>These also included sabbatical terms spent by further education tutors at the university, closer links between dons and further education tutors, and much more contact between Oxford students and prospective applicants from the sector. </p> <p>Clarity and openness were hallmarks of what both sides unanimously agreed was a frank, illuminating and encouraging exercise. </p> <p>\"I think they were listening very very carefully to what we have to say,\" said Sue Dutton, deputy chair of the Association of Colleges. </p> <p>Mansfield College, which hosted the one-day event, is spearheading a consortium of seven Oxford colleges which share the common aim of targeting the further education sector to stimulate more applications from it. </p> <p>Mansfield's principal, Professor David Marquand, reiterated what he made clear in Guardian Further last week, that for too long the numbers of further education students trying for Oxford had been far too low. </p> <p>Last year 459 candidates from the sector applied to Oxford. There were 4,373 applications from state schools and 3,426 from independent schools. </p> <p>Of the further education applicants 30% got in compared with a 38% overall success rate. Only 4% of \"mature\" applicants - aged over 21 - were successful. The further education sector caters for huge numbers of students in this age group. </p> <p>The possibility of increasing the numbers of mature undergraduate students at Oxford will be the focus of a project at Harris Manchester College, one of the consortium of seven. Harris Manchester bills itself as the only university college in the country which solely admits mature students to study full-time for a first degree. </p> <p>Perhaps the most useful part of the day for the principals and managers from general further education and sixth-form colleges was an explanation of the Oxford admissions procedure by Edwin Peel, law and admissions tutor at Keble College. </p> <p>He said the trickiest task facing admissions tutors was choosing between candidates who generally had exclusively A* and A GCSE scores and were predicted to get three As at A-level. He said candidates' personal statement and referees' assessments were scrutinised very carefully. And despite the mystique surrounding the Oxford interview, it was largely focused on the subject the candidate wanted to study. A number of mock interviews with students were staged to illustrate the point. </p> <p>Offers will remain three grade As in the form of A2s, not the new AS qualification, which, under the new Curriculum 2000, students will achieve in the first year of a typical two-year A-level course. </p> <p>\"We are an academic university. We think that three As at A2 is the academic benchmark for assessing candidates,\" he said. \"We will certainly take into account other qualifications.\" </p> <p>Ann Limb, principal of Cambridge Regional College, said afterwards: \"It was great, fantastic.\" </p> <p>She had no problems with the academic entry requirement. </p> <p>\"Further education realises that Oxford represents excellence and we want our students associated with that excellence.\"</p>",
  "<p>Probably the first economic migrants to visit Britain were the Romans - and a very good job they did when they arrived here, bringing much needed engineering skills with them. </p> <p>They gave us good roads, town planning and a much needed public sanitation system. The Romans were, in truth, the first visitors to fill what we today call the skills gap. </p> <p>So as interesting as Barbara Roche's views are on solving our current skills gap by allowing more highly skilled economic migrants in to Britain, they also prove, in the words of an old newspaperman, there is nothing new under the sun. </p> <p>And, while Mrs Roche's views are a contribution to the skills gap debate, they are obviously not the solution. As so often has been the case in the past, only we, the British people, government, industry and educationalists, can solve the persistent conundrum: \"Why do our main competitors in Germany, France and America all train their people better than we do?\" </p> <p>David Blunkett is the latest education secretary to try to improve our post-16 vocational training and he will outline his detailed plans in full at the Labour Party Conference in Brighton this week. </p> <p>We greatly welcome his commitment to attacking the inadequacies of vocational training for school-leavers. For too long Britain has focused its educational resources on the academic elite who have gone on to gain the glittering prizes at our world-renowned universities. </p> <p>Now we have an Education Secretary who has climbed to the top via the Gas Board and long hours of evening study at further education colleges, and who wants to do something for all those young people who regard Oxford merely as the town where Inspector Morse drives around in an old Jaguar. </p> <p>Our colleagues in the Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce condemned Mr Blunkett's proposed overhaul of apprenticeships as \"seriously flawed\". I believe that is too strong. The Education Secretary should score 10 out of 10 for effort and determination, but perhaps only 7 out of 10 for content. </p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry and British Chambers of Commerce complain that his \u00a36bn plan for 100,000 apprenticeships for 16- and 17-year-olds is too prescriptive, especially the fixed minimum time-serving and specifying where the training should take place, particularly in local further education colleges. They want flexibility in training. They do not want Whitehall telling them how long or where they should train their employees. </p> <p>Coming from an engineering background, where five-year apprenticeships used to be the norm, I do not have such a problem with prescribed minimum time-serving. My industry is now down to three-year apprenticeships, which I believe is about correct, but I can see why the service sector believes that even that may be too long for training in such areas as office skills. </p> <p>My main area of concern in what Mr Blunkett is proposing is the quality of applicants that will benefit from the new scheme when it is fully up and running. The Guardian reported last month, in an unsourced story, that he will offer apprenticeships to over 100,000 16- and 17-year-olds who drop out of work or school. </p> <p>I was pleased to see in recent interview that Mr Blunkett was careful to avoid such exaggerated claims. But even such claims from his advisers and spin doctors send out the wrong message. This policy is not directly about tackling poverty and social exclusion. It should not be viewed or used as some form or extension of New Deal. It is not even primarily about taking young people off the unemployment register. </p> <p>It is about giving school-leavers proper qualifications and training and providing a proper vocational ladder of qualifications that stands equal to the existing academic ladder of qualifications. </p> <p>It means that the brightest and best of our 16-year-olds can choose to take up an engineering apprenticeship rather than stay on at school, because that is the regular choice offered by their careers master. Why shouldn't a bright youngster choose to leave and learn to build world-beating McLaren Formula One cars in Woking rather than staying on into the sixth form? </p> <p>For far too long Britain's brightest and best have regarded trade as a dirty word. We welcome David Blunkett's efforts to end that elitist view. </p> <p> \u0095 Dr Michael Sanderson is chief executive of the Engineering Manufacturing Training Authority.</p>",
  "<p>A national university for the newly independent territory of East Timor could be open for business as early as next month, according to the man most widely expected to become the first elected leader of the world's youngest state. </p> <p>The guerrilla-turned-statesman Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, until last September a political prisoner in the Indonesian capital and now one of the key players in the effort to rebuild East Timor, said the as yet unnamed institution would be operating \"only in minimal conditions\", with at least another three years needed to constitute its curricula, teaching resources and overall structure. </p> <p>The transitional government cabinet in Dili, which comprises four East Timorese and four international ministers, has agreed to submit a plan to transfer budgetary funds to support the opening of the University of East Timor on a provisional basis next month. An earlier plan for Jesuit educators to establish a private university in the largely Roman Catholic territory has been placed on hold. </p> <p>Filomeo Jacob, the cabinet minister responsible for social affairs, has said the university will need to admit up to 4,500 students in its first intake. His government has appealed to international donors to assist with up to $2m in startup costs. </p> <p>Its language of instruction - a contentious issue among educators working on the half-island - will probably be Portuguese, although English and Indonesian are also being considered. </p> <p>During the decades of Indonesian occupation of the one-time Portuguese colony, which lasted from 1975 until last year, the Portuguese language was banned in public life, with the result being that a majority of today's young Timorese are more fluent in the Indonesian tongue. </p> <p>\"We have so many priorities in education right now,\" Gusm\u00e3o said, \"and the first ones have had to be for the schools.\" </p> <p>Gusm\u00e3o was in the South Pacific visiting Timorese postgraduates at New Zealand's Massey University. Those Timorese postgraduates not currently studying in New Zealand are at universities either in Australia or Japan - the latter enjoying longstanding educational links with Portugal - with another 4,000 enrolled at Indonesian campuses on Java, their attendance dating back to be fore last September's politically inspired mayhem in East Timor. </p> <p>Much of the half-island's already frail infrastructure was destroyed late last year after more than 80% of the island's 850,000 inhabitants used a historic referendum to choose independence from Indonesia. The plebiscite sparked weeks of violent unrest with hundreds, possibly thousands, of locals killed by militia forces loyal to Jakarta. Tracts of the capital, Dili, were razed by roaming gangs of street toughs. </p> <p>For administrative purposes, including education, the fledgling nation is now being run by the United Nations, ahead of local elections to be held by 2002. </p> <p>Western well-wishers, however, rather than military belligerents from nearby Indonesia, could yet prove to be the biggest future obstacle to the successful establishment of the university, said Gusm\u00e3o, mentioning the widely publicised case of Jarat Chopra, a lecturer in international law at Brown University in Rhode Island in the US, who abruptly quit Dili just four months into a two-year stint with the territory's UN administrators. </p> <p>Before his departure, Chopra accused the UN bureaucrats of putting the territory's future second to their own careers in a way that bordered \"on criminal negligence\". </p> <p>In the three months since then, said Gusm\u00e3o, \"we have tried - with some success, I believe - to persuade the UN that they must involve everyone in their work.\" But it isn't just the UN that has had to change, he added. \"It's visiting academics, too.\" </p> <p>With their rich-world viewpoints and training, foreign scholars continued to be a mixed blessing for materially impoverished East Timor, he said. \"They would do better not to come to us with a high sense of international standards, which are very good so far as they go, but don't really fit in with the reality of what is happening in East Timor. We can all probably work better if we work together, not from the sky down but from the ground up. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying that they're not very important to us - they are,\" he continued. \"But some academics, we've come to feel, are not always coming to us with a sufficient grasp of our reality, and that is becoming more of a problem for us, and the nation we are creating.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not so long ago, education was one of the sleepiest branches of the law. \"From 1907 until 1989 - that's 82 years - there were only 20 cases that could be genuinely claimed as dealing with education,\" says John Friel, a leading barrister in the field. </p> <p>Now everyone is having a pop at schools and local authorities, and hiring lawyers to juice up their claims: burnt-out teachers; former pupils who feel their schools failed them; parents who believe their child's special needs are not being met; parents of bullied children; even parents whose child simply didn't get into their school of choice. And, increasingly, those parents not actually going so far as the High Court are trundling along to appeals with a brief or solicitor in tow in the hope that legal muscle will scare a good result for them. </p> <p>League tables, Ofsted inspections and a sharpening of everyone's sense of being consumers and not mute recipients have changed the landscape. </p> <p>The number of appeals by parents against primary and secondary schools that did not admit their children rose from 77,000 in 1997-98 to 85,900 the following year. The figure for the latest school year is expected to show another leap to 95,000. </p> <p>At the same time, lawyers have found much to play with among the endless flow of legislation. Every new statute creates work for the legal profession, and since 1979, education acts have appeared at the rate of almost one a year. Latterly the acts have given education secretaries of state huge scope for issuing subsequent statutory instruments - orders and regulations filling in details. Of the 4,000 to 5,000 statutory instruments published annually by government, up to 200 concern education. </p> <p>In response to this burgeoning legislation, the Education Law Association (Elas) was set up 10 years ago to provide guidance to its membership of lawyers and educational managers. For a few years it remained an obscure body, but now it receives five inquiries a day from parents. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago you would have been hard put to find a lawyer who specialised in education,\" says Richard Clutterbuck, of Luton University, who produces the journal Education Law Monitor. Now, you can hardly move for them. Next month, London will host two conferences for them: one, chaired by Clutterbuck, is the Law Society's education law conference; the other focuses on special educational needs. </p> <p>And as the education \"consumers\" become more reliant on legal muscle, so, too, do the education \"providers\". Education matters would once have been a minor part of a municipal lawyer's duties; not any more. Jack Rabinowicz, partner at Teacher Stern Selby, a London firm, says: \"Local authorities now have a nominated lawyer in their legal department who's their education specialist.\" </p> <p>The action they face from parents comes in three categories: special needs, admissions and exclusions. </p> <p>The 1994 Code of Practice for special educational needs, which insisted that parents should be consulted, jolted them into starting to challenge decisions, says Clutterbuck. </p> <p>Since then there had been an incremental broadening of the definition of need, he says. The Court of Appeal earlier this year ruled that a tetraplegic child needed physiotherapy to get education. Unlike health services, which are rationed, educational services cannot be. Education authorities have used every procedural device to minimise numbers of children officially \"statemented\" for special provision and more parents have sought to challenge them. </p> <p>The proportion of special needs tribunal hearings - where parents appeal against decisions - to which parents are bringing lawyers is steadily rising. In 1997/98 only one in 10 parents was legally represented at the 1,200 or so cases heard each year. Last year it was one in five. </p> <p>Then, less than two months ago, a landmark House of Lords ruling upped the ante still further. Pamela Phelps, 26, was awarded \u00a345,650 damages for the west London borough of Hillingdon's failure to diagnose her dyslexia. This decision has had a predictable consequence: a deluge of calls to solicitors. </p> <p>Schools' admissions decisions where, typically, parents can't get children into their preferred secondaries because they are already full, have been more difficult to overturn since the 1998 Schools Standards and Framework act, but that hasn't stopped parents bringing lawyers in. It's cheaper to hire a lawyer than move house, says Clutterbuck, and \"it salves their conscience. Parents want to feel they've done their best for their child and if that means getting lawyers to fight appeals, they'll do it.\" </p> <p>Similarly, parents are increasingly seeking judicial review when their appeals about excluded children are turned down. Conversely, when heads readmit a child excluded for bullying, parents of the victims are starting to seek judicial review. </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, regrets that the presence of unstable kids, some reinstated after exclusion, has driven more teachers, including those who have been injured, to seek advice from their union lawyers about litigation. The landmark case came when a teacher, Hazel Spence-Young, won \u00a385,000 for a neck injury sustained in an assault by a pupil. </p> <p>John Friel rejects the notion that lawyers have been flooding into education as the pinch on legal aid has shrunk other activity. Some of his colleagues have pursued the speciality after fighting for their own children's needs. \"There are probably no more than 50 barristers with regular litigation experience in education.\" </p> <p>But what about 20 years ago? Probably none, he admits. </p> <p>\u0095 For a list of education solicitors in England and Wales, contact Elas on: 01303 211570.</p>",
  "<p>The seasons are all changing, <br></p> <p>All because of us. <br></p> <p>Don't you think it's time, <br></p> <p>that we all made a fuss? <br></p> <p> So rap the children from St Paulinus C of E Primary School in Crayford, Kent, who last week received the Millennium Marque from the Tidy Britain Group for their environmental work - the only school to be so honoured. </p> <p>The school is blessed with a little wooded area, and until about seven years ago this was just used as a short-cut to get to the playing field. A group of parents cleared away the rubbish from this overgrown and neglected corner of the grounds and marked out a proper pathway. That was the beginning of a sustainability project that has gone from strength to strength. </p> <p>On entering the school there is a wall covered with certificates - from Bexley in Bloom through to the prestigious Eco-Schools Award, evidence of the school's commitment towards green issues. </p> <p>The grounds are not huge, but with the well-planned layout they give the impression that a small child could wander for hours round ponds and through wooded secret gardens, or just sit and watch the birds and butterflies. Every aspect of the school is reviewed by the pupils for its environmental impact in order to identify targets for action and improvement. </p> <p>A plan is then drawn up involving the children, teachers, parents and local community, which is constantly monitored and evaluated. Different groups have responsibility for particular tasks: in the bird garden, where feeders of every shape and size are hung, the children in year six are responsible for watering the flowers, but the reception class fills the birdbath. This year reception have planted a hazel walk and bower, which, by the time they leave the school, will have grown into another established feature of the grounds. </p> <p>Projects are designed with this aim in mind, and the children have a sense of shared ownership in the school. Many still visit after they have left, wanting not just to check on how their own work has matured, but to see what the new kids have been up to. They also often initiate sustainability projects in their secondary schools. </p> <p>Environmental issues are integrated into the national curriculum, touching every subject. A regular science class feature is pond dipping - taking a jar of pond water and examining it and learning about the contents. The butterfly garden is planted and cared for by the children. On the wall are the descriptions and models of the different butterflies so that they can be easily identified. </p> <p>The pupils have carried out projects on waste recycling and have a policy of using both sides of the paper; the saving of energy is another high priority, with projects to design posters to remind each other to switch off the lights. The use, recycling and waste of water have found their way into maths and geography. And the environment is used in all areas of literacy, even if it is just sitting in the garden listening to a story. </p> <p>The grounds are treated as another classroom, to be appreciated all year round, not just in the summer. Outside of school hours are the Twitchers club and the Greenfingers club, the latter run by a parent whose children have now left St Paulinus - it isn't just the pupils who find it hard to leave. </p> <p>The school is very open and shares its grounds with the community and particularly with a nearby special needs school. With this in mind, the woodchip paths in the wood are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Again it is the pupils' responsibility to maintain the paths, making sure they are accessible. </p> <p>The local business community is also involved, and in amongst the labels for buddleia and lavender are plaques commemorating donations from Woolwich plc and benches from Sainsbury's and Barclays. </p> <p>The Eco-Schools project aims to bring up young people to act responsibly, and acknowledge what is happening in their environment - and in turn to influence their parents and peers. Bexley council wants to encourage positive citizens. The impact across the whole school has been positive, with academic results giving as much pleasure to the parents as the green fingers give to the pupils. </p> <p>The children at St Paulinus are proud of their achievements and Nicola and Vicki from year six, members of the eco-committee, needed no prompting to offer a guided tour, even in torrential rain. There was no way the eco-rap was not going to be performed for a visitor. The eco- committee is made up of pupils, teachers, governors and parents, but the children have a major input and it is another way they can express their views and know that their ideas are valued and taken into account. </p> <p>The various projects have resulted in financial savings for the school as the managing of utilities has come under the eco-committee's eagle eye and a policy of environmental purchasing has been agreed. </p> <p>New headteacher Adam Higgins has already been well briefed on the current projects, which include a raised viewing platform and a plan for the edge of the playground. He is beginning to sound like his pupils. </p> <p>\u0095 To apply for an Eco-Schools pack (which includes a handbook on how to run a scheme like this, environmental review booklet, and curriculum ideas), contact The Tidy Britain Group, Elizabeth House, The Pier, Wigan, WN3 4EX.

  "Slobodan Milosevic, struggling to retain his grip on the Yugoslav presidency, sought yesterday to force a second round runoff in the face of a deafening chorus of domestic and international calls for him to relinquish power. <p>All unofficial polls - except for those carried out by Mr Milosevic's Socialist party and some of its allies - put him more than 20% behind his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, who has managed to unite a fractured opposition. Mr Milosevic, cornered, is now fighting for time. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica, 56, a law professor, claimed victory in Sunday's ballot and demanded that the state election commission release the official count: \"This is a peoples' victory,\" he declared. \"We will defend our victory by peaceful means and we will protest for as long as it takes.\" </p> <p>As the commission delayed the announcement of the results, both sides issued widely conflicting unofficial results. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia claimed that with the votes counted at 60% of polling stations, Mr Kostunica was leading on 55.31%, against to Mr Milosevic's 34.19%. </p> <p>But Gorica Gajevic, the general secretary of Mr Milosevic's Socialist party, said that with 37 % of the ballots counted, the president was ahead, on 45 % to Mr Kostunica's 40%.\"This result gives us optimism that we can win in the first round,\" he added. </p> <p>There was no word from Mr Milosevic himself, and fears persisted that the authorities would resort to violence to retain their grip on power. </p> <p>Western countries piled the pressure on the Yugoslav leader to accept defeat. Germany, Britain, Italy, France and the European Union all declared that Mr Milosevic had lost in Sunday's vote. The US said it doubted Mr Milosevic could make any \"credible claim of victory\". </p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said: \"Today Milosevic is a beaten, broken-backed president. My message to him today is, be honest with your people. Get out of the way and let Serbia get out of the prison you have turned it into.\" </p> <p>The fightback began yesterday afternoon at a press conference for domestic consumption, in which Mr Gajevic insisted that Mr Milosevic had taken the first round of the election but that the margin was small, so he would fight a second round in a fortnight to give him absolute victory. </p> <p>But even former Milosevic allies such as the ultranationalist Radical party agree that he has lost. Analysts said Mr Milosevic's camp was divided between those advising him to declare an outright victory and those saying he should play for time. Even a runoff would represent a loss of face. </p> <p>Milos Aligridoc, a member of the opposition said yesterday: \"[A runoff] would mean absolute humiliation for him and he is not a man who likes to be humiliated .\" </p> <p>Belgrade was calm yesterday but pressure is beginning to mount against the business people involved with the rul ing party, who have long controlled the wealthy shopping streets and the black market in cigarettes, petrol and whisky. </p> <p>The opposition was out on the streets of Belgrade again last night, celebrating victory. Everywhere people are discussing Mr Milosevic's fate. </p> <p>\"I go for the Ceaucescu option myself,\"said one housewife. \"Although, I think he will be killed by someone inside his own circle who wants to become a hero of the Serbian people.\" </p> <p>The state election commission was locked out of its office in the federal parliament building yesterday, as it has been since Sunday night, effectively suspending the official count. Mirko Popovic, a member of the commission, said that technically they could be called in time to announce the official result on Thursday. </p> <p><b> Result according to pro- and anti-Milosevic camps</b> </p> <p>\u0095Main opposition bloc </p> <p>Milosevic 34% </p> <p>Kostunica 55% </p> <p>\u0095Serbian Radical party </p> <p>Milosevic 37.9% </p> <p>Kostunica 53.5% </p> <p>\u0095Socialist party </p> <p>Milosevic 45% </p> <p>Kostunica 40% </p> <p>\u0095Yugoslav Left party </p> <p>Milosevic 56.3% </p> <p>Kostunica 31.4%</p>",
  "Police are tracing the last, bizarre movements of an army deserter and former mercenary in Bosnia, who was shot dead after confronting police marksmen with a camouflaged air rifle in the grounds of a secure psychiatric hospital. <p>The police complaints authority launched an investigation into the tragedy yesterday after the man had briefly held up a police station late on Sunday night and then demanded to see a woman hospital worker. </p> <p>He was named yesterday as Kirk Davies, 30, who was jailed three years ago for attacking his father. The court heard that Davies had hero-worshipped his father until discovering that he was an ex-army lorry driver rather than the SAS veteran of Cambodia he had pretended to be. </p> <p>Davies appeared suddenly at Selby police station in West Yorkshire on Sunday evening, dressed entirely in black and with a gun draped in camouflage netting which he aimed at the duty sergeant. </p> <p>Police said yesterday that he ran off without firing the gun, but turned up an hour later at Newton Lodge secure hospital in Wakefield, 20 miles away, still brandishing the weapon. He asked for the woman, who works in another hospital nearby, which he appeared to be making for when police arrived. </p> <p>Assistant Chief Constable Andy Brown said Davies was challenged but refused to surrender the gun and was followed to a patch of woodland where he was challenged again and then shot. He did not fire at police and the gun was found to be an air rifle when paramedics moved in to take him to Pinderfields hospital, Wakefield, where he died soon after midnight. </p> <p>Mr Brown said: \"These are tragic circumstances and we have been in contact with Mr Davies's family and we offer our sympathy and condolences to them.\" </p> <p>Detectives have found no link between Davies and Newton Lodge, which houses a number of seriously disturbed patients, and believe that he mistook the building for the hospital where the unnamed woman works. He threatened terrified staff with his gun after they insisted that he had got the wrong hospital. </p> <p>Neighbours in Selby and the nearby village of Burn, where Davies had shared a council house with a girlfriend and her two-year-old son, said he had been unpredictable and a victim of \"black moods\" apparently connected to atrocities seen in the Balkans. Police were called regularly to domestic disputes at the house in St Leonard's Avenue, Selby, according to local residents, and Davies made regular references to his work as a sniper for the Croatians. </p> <p>He joined the Duke of Wellington's Regiment at 19, but deserted out of boredom, in spite of seeing action briefly in Northern Ireland. He then served as a mercenary sniper in Bosnia, allegedly killing 46 Serbian soldiers, according to his defence barrister at the 1997 trial for assaulting his father. </p> <p>Robert Collins, representing Davies at the appeal court in York, said that the young deserter had been \"involved in the very worst of the fighting and atrocities, seeing sights which no one would even wish to think about\". </p> <p>He told Recorder Aidan Marron QC: \"He can still see the faces of the Serbs he killed, and is now terrified of battles, having seen so many people dead.\" </p> <p>Davies's sentence was reduced from nine months' jail to probation. After hearing that his nightmares had been compounded by bitter disillusion with his father's lies, Recorder Marron told him: \"There is a need to address your problem and we wish you well.\" </p> <p>After the incident, Davies was moody and withdrawn according to Selby newsagent John Watson, 60, who listened to his stories of the Balkans as Davies drifted through a succession of local jobs as nightclub doorman, labourer and security guard. </p> <p>Mr Watson said Davies had once taken an overdose of painkillers and added: \"He suffered from what seemed like blackouts when he didn't appear to know what he was doing.\" </p> <p>Ian Murray, landlord of the Wheatsheaf in Burn, said that Davies had been quiet, but a member of the pub's pool team with his own cue called Excalibur. He said: \"He was a very competitive lad and he always liked to win but he never gave the impression of being a Rambo type.\"</p>",
  "<p>The investigation into missing embryos at two fertility clinics took a new twist last night when one of the hospitals involved confirmed that it was looking into possible financial irregularities in connection with the scientist at the centre of the scandal. </p> <p>The investigation is said to be focusing on whether Paul Fielding, an embryologist who worked for both North Hamp shire Hospitals NHS Trust in Basingstoke and the privately run Hampshire Clinic, submitted claims for IVF treatment he never actually carried out. This might explain why discrepancies have emerged between patient records and stored embryos. </p> <p>As 39 women treated at the hospitals where frozen embryos have gone missing were offered free DNA tests to prove their babies are their own, Mr Fielding's employer, the NHS trust, confirmed that its inquiry had widened to examine \"any question of financial irregularities\" in relation to his work involving the recording and storage of embryos. </p> <p>Until his suspension Mr Fielding had held the position at the NHS trust for about 10 years. He was contracted out to work for the private Hampshire Clinic until two months ago, when it appointed its own embryologist. </p> <p>Last night Mr Fielding's home in Whitchurch was deserted and neighbours said they had not seen him or his wifeand two young sons since the scandal broke on Thursday. </p> <p>A Hampshire Clinic spokeswoman, Carole Friend, said they had been unable to contact Mr Fielding and were keen to speak to him. </p> <p>Strict guidelines laid down by the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority mean that only a named embryologist can freeze and store em bryos and keep records of these operations. Seeing patients and harvesting eggs cis only carried out by a medical specialist. </p> <p>Ms Friend added: \"It looks like we are dealing with a case of poor record-keeping. It seems to be issues more about carelessness, not completing processes and never freezing embryos when he said he did.\" </p> <p>She confirmed that the clinic would consider offering free treatment to women whose fertility treatment has been suspended because of errors in their patient records relating to their stored embryos. In addition, DNA tests are being offered, although she claimed there was \"categorically no possibility\" women had been given the wrong embryos. </p> <p>The fact that some patients undergoing IVF treatment are distressed is of particular concern because it has a high failure rate and patients are advised to avoid stress. </p> <p>The two clinics are also bracing themselves for potential group legal action from patients whose embryos may have been lost or whose treatment has been disrupted. </p> <p>The situation came to light three weeks ago when staff were unable to find the frozen embryos of a patient due to undergo IVF treatment. As a result an audit was carried out at the assisted conception units at both the hospital and the clinic and it was found that nine containers were missing and other records appeared inconsistent. </p> <p>Last night Emma Holt, a specialist in clinical negligence with the Manchester law firm Pannone and Partners said couples whose embryos went missing may be able to bring a case for the loss of a chance of conceiving in respect of that embryo and the ordeal of having to repeat IVF treatment.</p>",
  "Health and safety laws covering work and transport are to be introduced for the first time in quarter of a century, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, announced at the Labour party conference yesterday. <p>The shake-up will see directors and companies being held legally responsible for accidents in the workplace and prison sentences being imposed for the majority of health and safety offences - instead of the minority. </p> <p>Corporate manslaughter could be brought in and fines are expected to be linked to a company's turnover or company directors' bonuses. </p> <p>The legislation, which will not be introduced before next spring, was heralded by Mr Prescott as he said lives were being lost in industries such as construction through sheer bad working practice. </p> <p>\"Company directors whose negligence costs lives must not be allowed to hide behind workers and get away with it scot-free,\" he told delegates. </p> <p>Each year, 400 people die in the workplace, with 1m injured, 29,000 seriously, at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a318bn. </p> <p>In addition, some 350 die each year in transport accidents - with 31 killed last year in the Paddington rail crash. The new legislation will also cover transport safety, and is expected to incorporate the recommendations of Lord Cullen whose inquiry into the Paddington disaster, and the wider issue of rail regulation and safety, will report back next spring. </p> <p>Mr Prescott also announced a goal to wipe out fuel poverty by 2010, and stressed that the government aimed to help the elderly and disabled by introducing half price bus fares for them all. </p> <p>He attacked The Countryside Alliance, many of whom were demonstrating outside the conference centre, and drew cheers as he insisted the government had to stand firm on the fuel crisis.</p>",
  "Ken Livingstone yesterday threatened legal action if John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, pressed ahead with his plans to part-privatise the London Underground, after an independent report damned them as offering poor value for money and potentially risking the safety of passengers. <p>London's mayor, who is due to take over the tube only after the private contracts are locked in place, said it would now be unreasonable in law for the government to carry on with its public-private partnership unless there were radical changes to the scheme. </p> <p>His remarks were made as government sources said that conflict between the Treasury and Mr Prescott's Transport and Environment Department over how to finance tube modernisation were hampering attempts to achieve a workable political compromise over the issue. </p> <p>Tony Blair conceded during the London mayoral election that it would be difficult to go ahead with part-privatisation of the tube if Mr Livingstone were elected, but the government now appears determined to force through the scheme. </p> <p>Yesterday's report by Will Hutton, chief executive of the Industrial Society think tank, commissioned at Labour's insistence, argued that the PPP should be abandoned in favour of a bond-financed public sector option, unless tougher safeguards on safety, contract compliance and value for money are introduced. </p> <p>\"I would have thought to proceed now in the light of Will Hutton's complaints, unless they adapt and take on board his points, there is an opening for a judicial review of the decision,\" said Mr Livingstone. </p> <p>\"I am not opposed to partnership with the private sector on principle, but this is a rotten deal which binds London for 30 years to overgenerous contracts giving private sector monopolies intolerable powers over London's democratically-elected authorities\". </p> <p>The Rail Maritime and Transport union's senior tube official, Bob Crow, yesterday raised the prospect of a strike over safety on the London Underground, while Mick Rix, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said the Hutton report had blown a hole through the government's case for PPP. </p> <p>\"The government must now think again and start listening to the trade unions, the elected London mayor and Londoners who voted for him on a platform of a properly funded, publicly owned future for the tube.\"</p>",
  "<p>The ale is looking increasingly flat at Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, the maker of traditional tipples such as Banks's, Marston's and Pedigree bitter. </p> <p>Wolves brushed aside a takeover proposal from the private equity firm Botts &amp; Co with surprising arrogance last month, to the irritation of many of its shareholders. At the time, the management dropped non-too-subtle hints that there would be pleasing surprises in this month's trading statement. </p> <p>That statement flopped on to investors' doormats yesterday offering little comfort - the fullest flavour on offer was a less than booming 1.2% increase in like-for-like sales during August. The brewer is, at best, back on schedule with the integration of recently acquired Marston's and Mansfield, after suffering a severe bout of hiccups in the spring. </p> <p>Wolves' long-term problem is that it makes ale which, while enjoyed by purists, hardly attracts the cachet of a vodka and Red Bull. The management's response has been to get bigger, in the hope that economies of scale will drive profits forward. So, through a series of takeovers, Wolves has cornered the market in running street-corner boozers in towns in the midlands and north. </p> <p>Cost cutting is continuing - Wolves is likely to announce imminently that at least one, possibly two, of its four breweries is to go. It has done little with one of its few promising businesses: Pitcher &amp; Piano, a bar chain inherited from Marston's. It is a sad fact of life that the traditional brewing industry is in a slow, long-term decline. Wolves' management has aggravated the situation by trying to do too much, too fast. Botts &amp; Co is hardly the most credible bidder for a \u00a3470m business - it is struggling to decide whether to pay \u00a312m for the even less glamorous Oriental Restaurants Group. </p> <p>But for Wolves, a tight control on costs will be insufficient to satisfy the market's insatiable desire for growth. The best place for the company is in private hands - the question is, whether it will fall to a careful owner. </p> <p><strong> Exchange stakes </strong><br> </p> <p>Here is an obscure fact concerning the fight for control of the London Stock Exchange: a portion of the declared 3.6% stake in the exchange held by the investment bank UBS Warburg is in fact beneficially owned by its hedge fund, UBS O'Connor. </p> <p>The fund was set up in June, drawing together a sizeable group of UBS Warburg's top risk-taking traders in Chicago and London to manage money provided by the parent bank and any of the investment bank's clients who fancied a seriously professional flutter in a high-risk, high-reward world. </p> <p>How or why UBS O'Connor ended up with a stake in the LSE remains a mystery, although it is assumed the hedge fund thought this particular corporate play to be a good punt. Indeed, since the LSE's demutualisation in mid-summer, the shares have moved from a low of \u00a319 to a recent high of close to \u00a331 - a capital gain of 63% for a well timed speculation in less than two months. </p> <p>Understandably, the bank does not discuss individual trading positions. The size of its holding is unknown, but is thought to be relatively small. What is clear cut is that the hedge fund manager is holding the stake for one reason: to make money. </p> <p>Sentimentality over a 200-year-old British institution will not get in the way; neither will the broader implications for UBS, one of the City's premier banks, stemming from a change of ownership of the exchange. Hedge funds only exist to provide their investors with exceptional returns on their money. Should this bother us? For all the debate over institutions becoming more socially aware in their investment choices, financial markets are overwhelmingly driven by the short-term profit motive. Making a speculative gain on the future of the exchange is perhaps just an especially cute bet. (It is also worth noting here that numerous senior staff at the exchange have taken personal punts on the future of the business by buying shares in the London Stock Exchange for themselves.) </p> <p>Yet somehow the brazen nature of UBS's action feels uncomfortable. In the main, the holding in the LSE is a legacy of its past takeover of two building blocks of London's modern financial community, SG Warburg and Phillips &amp; Drew. The bank may argue now that it is impossible to act simultaneously as a shareholder in the exchange while being one of its prime customers - and it is evident that this peculiarity has muddled quite a few stockbroking brains over recent months. It may also argue that, as a separate hedge fund operation, UBS O'Connor is given its own head, being left to pursue value wherever its dealers manage to spot it. </p> <p>But whatever the chinese walls and other internal procedures at UBS, the parent bank risks being badly misunderstood when it comes to debating and eventually deciding the LSE's future.</p>",
  "Labour's pensions minister was booed and heckled yesterday by angry OAPs as he attempted to defend the government's refusal to restore the link between earnings and benefits. <p>At the most inflammatory fringe meeting of the Labour conference, Jeff Rooker struggled to make himself heard as pensioners drowned out his speech with cries of: \"Restore the link.\" </p> <p>Mr Rooker misjudged the mood of the 500 pensioners when he told the meeting, after a powerful speech by the veteran campaigner Barbara Castle, that he wanted to \"dispel a few myths\". As he reeled off statistics about pensions, saying that less people were now subjected to means tests, members of the audience shouted \"give us our pensions back\" and \"you don't listen to us\". Sweating and looking unsettled, Mr Rooker provoked the audience when he leant over to one noisy pensioner and said: \"I'm worried about your health, don't have a heart attack.\" The pensioner replied that he had already suffered a heart attack. </p> <p>Jack Jones, the veteran former transport union leader, attempted to calm the atmosphere with an appeal for quiet. But this failed to silence the protestors who continued to barrack Mr Rooker. \"Will you shut up while I'm speaking please,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Rooker brought his speech to an abrupt end and hurried back to the safety of the main conference hall to listen to Gordon Brown's speech. </p> <p>Lady Castle, who introduced the link between pensions and earnings in the 1970s, was given a rapturous reception as she entered the meeting, which was also attended by veteran Labour MP Tony Benn and the agony aunt Clare Rayner. Supported by an aide, the frail 89-year-old former cabinet minister demanded a restoration of the link to ensure that future pensioners are protected. \"We are fighting for the restoration of the welfare state and the abolition of the mentality of the poor law - don't let it come back,\" she said. </p> <p>Jack Jones was applauded as he told the meeting that this year's increase in the basic state pension of 75p had been \"derisory\". He said that there were billions of pounds in the National Insurance fund which could be spent on boosting pensions. \"It's our money and that money should be released by way of substantial increases to the pensioners this year,\" he said. \"We are not asking for the moon.\" </p> <p>Mr Benn joked that he was an \"apprentice pensioner\" at the age of 76. Saying that pensioners' concerns have been \"brushed aside\" for too long, he used Gerald Kaufman's famous description of Labour's 1983 election manifesto to underline the importance of restoring the earnings link. </p> <p>\"The decision not to link pensions and earnings is the shortest suicide note in history,\" he said. \"The people in this room are the people who served in the war, voted Labour and gave us all the achievements we have had.\"</p>",

  "\u0095 Jeremy Hardy (Pass at red, September 25) is wrong to say that some rail companies don't want to install automatic train protection because of the cost. The train protection and warning system (TPWS), which is currently being fitted to track and trains, will mitigate the effects of 70% of signals passed at danger by the time it is fully installed by the scheduled date of end-2003. And if current trends continue, it will be a large proportion of a small number (the number of incidents in July 2000 - latest figures - was half that of July 1999). <p>We cannot fit additional further automatic train protection (ATP) yet, for these reasons: European law requires that any new system should be \"interoperable\" (capable of being used on any EU railway without modification). Neither of the systems currently installed in Britain is likely to comply. The European Train Control System has been developed to meet that requirement and is currently being tested at various levels of sophistication. When it is ready, we shall install it in Britain. It will prevent trains passing red signals. Until then, the best option is to use our existing systems of ATP and install TPWS, as Sir David Davies recommended in his report in February. </p> <p><b>Ian MacKellar</b><br> Association of Train Operating Companies<br><a href=\"mailto:Ian.MacKellar.atoc@ems.rail.co.uk\">Ian.MacKellar.atoc@ems.rail.co.uk</a> </p> <p>\u0095Jeremy Hardy describes TPWS, now being installed, as \"crappy, dangerous technology\". TPWS, unlike the more sophisticated ATP, is available now. It would have prevented accidents like Ladbroke Grove by stopping the slower of the two trains. </p> <p>The best is always the enemy of the good and the really reprehensible action would be to postpone installation of TPWS (the best available technology) for an even better version not yet in production. </p> <p><b>Lord Bradshaw</b></p>",
  "\u0095 Eight foot wire mesh fences protect Tonytown's borders, keeping pensioners, gamekeepers, hauliers and other populist purveyors of Poujadist protests in the outside world. Entry to the mini-state is through airport-style security checks at border points operated by Group 4. Construction minister Nick Raynsford, turning up with government red box in left hand, discovered rank wins no privileges. The guards ran a check after refusing to believe he was the N Raynsford of HMG when he hopped off a bus rather than out of the back of a car. His lead-lined red box rendered the X-ray ma chine useless, the guards arguing he must open it so they could check all it contained was confidential papers.

  "<p>An obscure recommendation in a government report could pave the way for gay and lesbian couples legally to conceive children together, it has been claimed. </p> <p>Calum MacKellar, an Edinburgh-based biochemist and ethicist, argues that the recent Donaldson report on human cloning and embryonic cell research opened up a legal loophole allowing same-sex conception, and that science could soon catch up with it. </p> <p>But an authority in the field said yesterday that the research breakthroughs needed to allow gay or lesbian couples to become biological parents of children were too far away for the government to think about changing the law. </p> <p>The Donaldson report will form the basis for any changes to the law. One of its little noticed recommendations is that the technology involved in Dolly the sheep style animal cloning should be used to help women with defective eggs to become pregnant. </p> <p>Under this system, gene-carrying chromosomes would be removed from the nucleus of a woman's defective egg and placed inside a donor egg which had had its genetic material removed. Sperm from the woman's partner would be used to fertilise the egg. </p> <p>Since this is not cloning, it has attracted little controversy. But Dr MacKellar claims it could be interpreted as allowing the creation of \"male eggs\", where the chromosomes from sperm are used instead of genetic material from a woman's egg. A second man's sperm would then fertilise the egg. </p> <p>But Azim Surani, of the Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology in Cambridge, said nature had placed a barrier in the way of two fathers or two mothers conceiving children together which for the foreseeable future looked insurmountable. </p> <p>\"If you try to make an embryo with two paternal sets of genes, these embryos will die very shortly after birth,\" said Professor Surani. \"You cannot get a viable offspring under any circumstances if you only have a paternal contribution. You really do require a contribution from the mother.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"If at some point in the future this becomes a practical possibility, the expert group may want to further consider the issues which may be raised.\"</p>",
  "Before my husband was imprisoned in Liberia prison for espionage last month, my knowledge of West Africa was limited to a Blue Peter summer special (circa 1974) when the team went off to the Ivory Coast. I remember it looked beautiful and the team kept saying they were exhilarated. I am now more familiar with African politics and know the names (and some of the telephone numbers) of the area's leaders. <p>David is a television producer- director. He spent most of last year making a series for Channel 4 about the hairdressing chain, Vidal Sassoon. Early this summer, tired of bobs and shampoo, he accepted a job to make a film about Liberia and its government. He was thrilled to have the chance to go to Africa and tell a big international story. </p> <p>We spoke several times after he arrived. He told me that filming was difficult and access to President Charles Taylor was being denied, although he had agreed to be interviewed. I began to feel really uncomfortable and my two small boys and I started to count the \"sleeps\" left before David would be home. </p> <p>Then I got the call. It was about 9.30pm on Friday August 18. On television, Friends had just finished. I never got to see Frasier. David said his room had been searched and his tapes had been seized but he was OK. There was nothing to worry about. He was on schedule to leave on Sunday and would be home by Monday. But there was something in his voice that I didn't recognise at first. Fear. </p> <p>Next day, at lunchtime, David's executive producer called to tell me that my husband had been arrested and had spent the night in a police cell. This couldn't be happening. The idea that the sweetest, most innocent man in the world, whose only brush with the law was being drunk in charge of a moped as a student, could be banged up in a Liberian cell was beyond belief. </p> <p>I rang round friends and family. My father-in-law came round and occupied the boys while I tried to get more information. I called a friend of ours, Roy Ackerman, a South African-born television executive who said he would call his uncle, who knew Nelson Mandela. It sounded like a long shot. Friends started to turn up at the house and a campaign committee formed in my kitchen. We started to lobby the Foreign Office, the United Nations and the World Bank. But by the end of the first day, I knew little other than David was still being detained. I felt utterly powerless. </p> <p>Somehow, I slept for about five hours. At 6am, I called the production company that had hired David and screamed at the executive producer, whom I had woken. We had a very animated conversation. He was tense and tired and told me to stop \"crapping on his head\"; he didn't have any more news. At 7am, the Liberian story was the third item on the Radio 4 news. My husband was named. I unplugged the radio and television, preferring news from the ground. At 9am, my sister took my boys to Legoland. I hadn't told them anything. I wanted to keep them in their happy summer-of-fun bubble. </p> <p>Then my world went mad. I received a call from the Foreign Office telling me that next day David would be charged with espionage and sent to prison. </p> <p>By lunchtime on Sunday, reality had taken on a whole new look. Nelson Mandela had telephoned President Taylor and asked for the four to be released. This was unbelievable - but there was more to come. Jesse Jackson, the US special African envoy, went live on CNN to plead for David's release. There I was, chain-smoking in the garden of my north London house, and there was Jackson, one of the most influential politicians on the planet, talking on what is arguably the most politically influential television channel on the planet, about my husband and the wellbeing of his family. </p> <p>Shortly after his appearance on CNN, I was asked by Jackson's office if I would like to give the special envoy a statement or ask any questions. I had five minutes to think about it. We scratched our heads. \"What about getting him to sort out your resident's parking?\" my father-in-law suggested. Once the nervous laughter died, we dictated a few lines about David, his innocence and his credibility as a film-maker. </p> <p>I received another call from the Foreign Office, this time asking me to dictate a message that the European consul in Liberia would be able to pass to David. I told him I was strong and fighting, I told him the boys were fine and in Legoland. </p> <p>The next day, things deteriorated. \"The Liberian Four\", as the media had named them, were charged and sent to prison. There was talk of a trial in November. I was reassured that the four men were together, separated from other prisoners and in good spirits. The prison was \"really clean, for Africa\". </p> <p>Tim Gardam, the director of programmes at Channel 4, called me. In television mythology, this man is a god and people like me don't get to talk to him, let alone shout expletives at him. He was sympathetic and deeply upset. But I still shouted at him: \"He's my love, he's my life, you've got to get him home.\" </p> <p>My house had turned into a 24- hour drop-in centre for concerned friends and family who comforted, humoured and organised a running buffet of mixed delicacies - pork pies, doughnuts and caviar, all the things people know I love. I couldn't swallow any of it. But boy, could I smoke. </p> <p>During a late night think-in, our friend Roy came up with the name George Weah - a Manchester City footballer and, apparently, the most famous Liberian in the world. It took me a while to get the power of the footie thing. The influence Beckham would have on Tony Blair, Roy assured me, was not a good comparison. </p> <p>Then came the Colonel Gadafy connection. A friend in the US had spoken to former president Jimmy Carter who suggested, bizarrely, that I fly to Libya and meet the colonel. Gadafy is apparently close to Taylor and happy to help out in difficult international situations. He would appreciate a personal visit from a wife, I was told. But how could I leave my children? </p> <p>Wednesday was grim. I got a call saying David had been beaten up. I cracked. I was sick. More calls were made to Mandela and Jackson. A few hours later, Gardam called to say that David hadn't been beaten up. He had been psychologically abused. We agreed to meet the following day. </p> <p>I took Roy, my sister and my father-in-law with me. We had a brief, but vivid, meeting at Channel 4 and then went to the Foreign Office where our moods were soon lifted. We met James Watt, the head of the consular division. Things, he assured us, were happening. The chairman of Channel 4 had written to Taylor apologising for any action the crew might have taken to cause offence, and undertook not to continue with the film. The four men had also apologised to the Liberian government. The British ambassador to the Ivory Coast was in Monrovia, holding meetings with the Liberian justice minister. </p> <p>By Friday, mercifully, the combination of apology, international pressure and diplomacy secured the men's release - so I never got to take tea with Gadafy in his tent. The men were flown from Monrovia to the Ivory Coast. David rang me at about 9.30pm - the most welcome phone call I have ever received. But it also threw another episode of Frasier down the tubes.</p>",

Have we unwittingly stumbled on the root of gender inequality? We think we should be told. </p> <p>\u0095 Finally, we are working on an article that examines the impact of rape and sexual assault on victims' partners. How did it affect you?

  "Jim Gavin, who has died aged 89, was one of the last surviving climbers to attempt Mount Everest before the second world war. A capable skier and sailor, he was also a distinguished soldier, who made a dramatic wartime escape from the Japanese, and later worked for the Special Operations Executive. <p>Gavin was born in Chile, and educated at St Peter's school, in Santiago, and Uppingham school, Rutland. After the Royal Military Academy and a commission in the Royal Engineers, he read mechanical engineering at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1931, and took up climbing with the university mountaineering club in the Bernese Oberland. </p> <p>He climbed with some of the best of his day - including Colin Kirkus and Frank Smythe - and his physical toughness so impressed Smythe that he suggested to Hugh Ruttledge, leader of the 1936 Everest expedition, that the relatively young lieutenant would be an asset on the mountain. </p> <p>Two reconnaissance expeditions had earlier looked at Everest, and three fullscale attempts had failed to reach the summit, but the 1936 team looked strong on paper, with Gavin one of only two newcomers to a group that included Smythe, Eric Shipton, Charles Warren and Percy Wyn Harris. Although Gavin had no Himalayan experience, he nevertheless helped Smythe open the route to the north col that season, raising hopes of an early summit attempt. Sadly, these were thwarted by the arrival of the monsoon. </p> <p>The following year, Gavin and his Cambridge contemporary, Ashley Greenwood, climbed together in Chamonix, attempting a traverse of the Aiguilles des Drus, during which a fellow officer had his dislocated shoulder reset in the middle of a steep mountain. Gavin returned to Chamonix in 1940, having temporarily given up his commission in the Royal Engineers to join a Scots Guards skiing battalion. The plan was to enter and support Finland - then at war with the Soviet Union - via neutral Sweden; in the event, it came to nothing, and the skiers left in a hurry as the Germans took control of France. </p> <p>Gavin then embarked on a sabotage mission to Norway, but after his submarine was badly damaged by depth charges, the expedition was abandoned and Gavin moved to the mountain warfare school at Loch Ailort. In 1941, he was sent to Singapore to open a commando training centre and launch a sabotage campaign in Malaya against the advancing Japanese. But little was accomplished, and he found himself, as a valued officer, with the chance to get out as Singapore fell in early 1942. </p> <p>He had, however, fallen in love with Barbara Murray and, with only wives allowed to accompany departing officers, they quickly married and flew to Sumatra. They would have 53 years together, and two daughters and a son. </p> <p> T he Japanese had destroyed much of the local Sumatra shipping, and Gavin and Barbara at first found themselves marooned. But as an engineer and a keen sailor, who had participated in the Fastnet race, he was able to rig up a tug, and together they sailed to Ceylon before embarking by train for northern India. </p> <p>It was during a riot on the train that Gavin suffered the heart attack that was to break his health, and leave him considerably weaker for the rest of his life. After recuperating in Kashmir, he re turned to Europe to work on sabotage equipment for SOE. In 1944, on the verge of being parachuted into northern Italy from his post in Cairo, he was transferred to General Eisenhower's allied headquarters at Versailles. </p> <p>Gavin went on to hold senior posts with the Royal Engineers, and became a general staff officer at the British joint services mission in Washington, between 1948 and 1951. He then commanded 36 Engineer Regiment at Ripon, was a general staff officer at Camberley, and commanded 11 Engineer Group at Osnabruck. He ended his military career in 1967 as assistant chief of staff (intelligence) at SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers, Europe. </p> <p>He then spent 10 years as technical director of the British Standards Institution, working on the introduction of metrication, before retiring to Milland, near Liphook, Hampshire. After his wife died in 1994, he spent the remaining years with his daughter in Dorset. </p> <p>\u0095 Major-General James Merricks Lewis Gavin, mountaineer and soldier, born July 28 1911; died August 21 2000</p>",
  "Markus Lupfer presented his fourth catwalk show yesterday, with a collection for spring and summer that has secured the approbation of buyers and press alike. <p>The London fashion week venue was unusual, a former church turned sports hall on a trading estate in west London, but it was packed to the rafters with the cream of the fashion crowd, and they did not leave disappointed.</p> <p>Building on the success of last season, his collection had the usual Lupfer trademarks, supple leathers and bold graphics, but the overriding difference was a giant leap in confidence.</p> <p>With a tight colour palette of black, cream, green, lilac and blue, he tipped his shallow brimmed trilby in a Mod direction once again.</p> <p>Masculine leather jackets (with all important shoved-up sleeves) were worn with micro minis and mid-calf colourful boots.</p> <p>The key print was Prince of Wales check on a cream base with red or blue.</p> <p>The check was blown up for some bias cut silk dresses with draping cowl necks and floaty sleeves, and used in miniature on high button prim shirts matched with A-line skirts.</p> <p>In true Lupfer style the check was then juxtaposed with differently weighted fabrics. A check blouse was worn with a pastel blue leather skirt that had ribbons of leather hanging from the waistband; and check trousers were worn with a light black lace top swathed in black and white feathers.</p> <p>There was even a tribute to cowgirl - a check skirt studded with rhinestones.</p> <p>Lupfer kept the emphasis on the hips, a trend already in evidence on many other catwalks this season. Bands of smocking adorned the backs of jackets and the bottoms of blouses, cinching them at hip level. Chunky leather belts wrapped skirts which themselves often featured a dropped peplum (waistband), again drawing attention to the hips.</p> <p>Lupfer followed up last season's photo prints with a series of dresses and separates featuring a flock of birds taking off from water - herons or was it ducks? We could not decide, but my guess is that ducks are too downmarket for the fashion crowd. Then again ... maybe we are getting used to slumming it.</p>",
  "France's political elite was reeling yesterday after the highly damaging allegations of kickbacks centred on the president, Jacques Chirac, spread to embroil a former Socialist finance minister and dragged in the name of the celebratedfashion designer, Karl Lagerfeld. <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a leading ministerial light until forced by graft allegations to resign from Lionel Jospin's cabinet last year, admitted that for nearly two years he had been sitting on potentially devastating corruption evidence against Mr Chirac.</p> <p>The disgraced former finance minister confirmed he had been given a now-infamous videotape last April in which Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry, a property developer and senior official in Mr Chirac's RPR party, directly implicated the president in a vast covert fundraising operation.</p> <p>M\u00e9ry recorded the tape before dying of cancer last year. His lawyer gave the cassette to Mr Strauss-Kahn - apparently in the hope that as finance minister he would arrange a massive tax break for another of the lawyer's clients, the couturier Karl Lagerfeld.</p> <p>Amid mounting suspicion in RPR ranks that the Socialist party was responsible for the release of the tape to French media last week, an embattled President Chirac immediately called for an investigation into \"the possible involvement of Mr Strauss-Kahn in this very serious matter\".</p> <p>After a morning crisis meeting the prime minister, Mr Jospin, promised to hold a swift inquiry and said the finance ministry would hand over all relevant documents to magistrates later in the day. Mr Jospin is anxious to prevent any further fallout on his ruling coalition.</p> <p>Mr Strauss-Kahn, a lawyer by training and a close friend of the prime minister, admitted he had received the original of the tape from M\u00e9ry's counsel, Alain Belot, but denied he had ever watched it and claimed he did not even know where it was.</p> <p>\"I knew Belot as a tax lawyer and because he had worked with the parliament's tax committee,\" Mr Strauss-Kahn told Le Monde. \"He gave me a tape and said: 'Have a look at that, it's interesting.' He said it was about illicit RPR fundraising at Paris town hall, but he never told me the president was implicated.\"</p> <p>The former Socialist minister, already under investigation for alleged false accounting at his law firm, could now face charges of obstructing justice for having withheld the tape - especially as Mr Belot is reported to have told police that Mr Strauss-Kahn asked him last week not to reveal the fact that he had the tape.</p> <p>Before his fall from grace, Mr Strauss-Kahn had been hotly tipped as the Socialist party's candidate for Paris mayor in next year's municipal election. The tape, detailing allegations of institutionalised RPR corruption at Paris town hall, would have been a powerful electoral asset.</p> <p>Mr Lagerfeld's fashion house declined all comment on the story, but according to French media the couturier was indeed the subject of a big tax investigation and faced a \u00a330m demand last year after it emerged he had not paid any tax in France for six years.</p> <p>One paper said that he eventually paid just \u00a35m, though there is no evidence that any special favour was granted by the authorities.</p> <p>Mr Strauss-Kahn rejected all allegations of wrongdoing. He told French radio that he denied \"all political connections that people are trying to make, as well as any connections with any tax dossier\" involving Mr Lagerfeld.</p> <p>The extraordinary tale of widespread corruption in high places began to emerge last week when Le Monde printed, in two consecutive issues over some six pages, the transcript of M\u00e9ry's tape, which the businessman recorded in 1996 \"in case anything happens to me\".</p> <p>He claimed that he was in charge of a many-tentacled system whereby construction companies paid big bribes to win maintenance, heating and other contracts for city-owned housing blocks while Mr Chirac was mayor of Paris.</p> <p>The vast majority of the money, he said, went to Mr Chirac's RPR.</p> <p>The allegations from beyond the grave, which dropped like a bombshell in Paris and were furiously denied by Mr Chirac, were the latest in a string of corruption accusations levelled against the president pertaining to the period from 1977 to 1995 when he was mayor.</p>",
  "A record abstention rate in a referendum on shortening the presidential term has sent a strong signal to the political establishment that it is out of touch with people's concerns, analysts said yesterday. <p>Almost 70% of the French electorate failed to vote in Sunday's referendum on whether to cut the head of state's time in office from seven to five years, aligning it with the parliamentary term and with most of Europe. </p> <p>The change was approved by 73% of those who bothered to vote, but it was the abstention rate - the highest in the nine referendums held during the fifth republic - that grabbed the headlines. </p> <p>\"A little Yes, but a big slapdown,\" was the verdict of Le Parisien, while Lib\u00e9ration and France Soir referred to \"the vote strike\" and the conservative Le Figaro called the poll \"a huge political and symbolic failure\". </p> <p>Most commentators agreed on the value of the reform. The presidential mandate was out of synch with parliament's five-year term, leading to paralysing \"cohabitations\" between presidents and prime ministers of different political persuasions that block real institutional change. </p> <p>\"Today, it's clear that the path towards reform of our institutions is open,\" said Dominique Chagnollaud, a constitutional law professor. \"No matter who is elected president in 2002, he will not be able to avoid far-reaching institutional reform.\" </p> <p>But many criticised the method President Jacques Chirac chose to ratify the reform. France's constitution can be changed by a special joint congress of the upper and lower houses of parliament, and putting such an arcane issue to the people was, analysts said, inappropriate. </p> <p>But the main reason for the indifference was that most French people are more concerned by practical issues such as soaring petrol prices, their heavy tax burden, and the current corruption saga tainting many in the political class.</p>",
  "Cable operators in India last night blacked out TV screens in almost 1m homes in protest at a new broadcasting law which holds them directly responsible for showing adult programmes, and for screening advertisements for beer and cigarettes. <p>The operators say it is \"ridiculous\" to blame them for the contents of India's mostly mediocre 70 TV channels and claim it is the broadcasters who should be the target of government legislation. </p> <p>The strike, which is set to go on for three days, has so far only affected Delhi, completely wiping out coverage of the Olympics and all state-run channels. </p> <p>\"So far we have only hit Delhi. But unless the government wakes up soon and does something about the law the strike will spread to Bombay and across the country,\" Vikki Chowdhry, of the Cable TV Operators United Front said last night. \"We are not responsible for what is on TV. The government must scrap this lopsided legislation.\" </p> <p>There was confusion in gov ernment circles as to what, exactly, would fall foul of the new cable network act. By western standards, Indian TV is remarkably chaste with no full frontal nudity and not much kissing. The country's most risque channel is Fashion TV, which shows models gliding down the catwalk, while Indian actresses are required to do nothing more suggestive in Hindi movies than to gyrate in the obligatory wet sari scene. </p> <p>Under the new legislation cable operators will receive a warning if they are deemed to be transmitting obscene material. They then face arrest if they repeat the offence. Delhi's police chief Dr K K Paul, yesterday claimed that certain operators were flouting the rules by transmitting pornography in the early hours of the morning. \"If they are as clean as they say they are, then why are they going ahead with the strike?\" he asked. </p> <p>The law which came into effect two weeks ago has attracted the wrath of India's tobacco advertisers who say they spend only 1% of funds on TV ads. The industry claims that such adverts are shown at times when children are unlikely to be watching. The law's only immediate casualty appears to be adverts for Kingfisher, one of India's most popular beers, which have now been pulled. </p> <p>India's broadcasting minister, Arun Jaitley, has defended the new act, which comes amid wider moves to liberalise Indian TV, including a decision two months ago allowing foreign companies to broadcast to India via cable for the first time. </p> <p>\"We are a liberal society. We will ban cable operators only in the rarest of rare cases. Power to ban any channel is only with central government,\" Mr Jaitley insisted. </p> <p>But under the new, more stringent rules shows deemed to be adult, previously only broadcast between 11pm and6am, have been banned completely. \"All programmes will now have to be in conformity with the code prescribing norms of decency, morality and national security,\" a government spokesman said. An estimated 50m Indians own TV sets, with another 100m believed to have access to television.</p>",
  "HMS Anon, an unnamed 4,000-tonne destroyer, hurtled past Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty at 32 knots and set course to ram-raid the twin towers of the World Trade Center on Manhattan Island. <p>The fog came down over New York and the captain did a stomach-churning swerve in a rolling 10ft sea to avoid a buoy. Then he slid the vessel, which had by this time metamorphosed into a 30,000-tonne container ship, deftly between a couple of other boats and made full speed backwards. </p> <p>Earlier, without leaving his berth in a factory unit on a Birkenhead industrial estate, the skipper had taken the same container ship on a run down the misty Mersey (Eastham docks to port, Liverpool's twin cathedrals to starboard) and past the Pier Head. Night fell, lights twinkled and the vessel snuggled through Gladstone Lock and into Seaforth docks. </p> <p>So ended the sea trials of a \u00a31.6m maritime equivalent of a flight simulator installed by Liverpool's John Moores University next to the Cammell Laird shipyard. </p> <p>It is Britain's first ship simulator with a full 360 degree field of vision, which enables learner drivers to check whether the back end of the boat is smacking into the dock when they make a tight turn. </p> <p>Chief mates, master and marine pilots keen to improve their skills stand in a five-tonne replica of ship's bridge, complete with charts and radar screens, and are required to cope with all the perils of the sea: 100 knot gales, tide changes, engine failure, instrument breakdown. </p> <p>\"If you had wanted to, could you have rammed that other ship?\" someone asked Bert Kunze, director of the Lairdside Maritime Centre where the simulator is housed. \"Yes, but that's not the object of the exercise,\" he replied. \"If I had, the image would have shaken a bit. But no bits of metal would have fallen off and we have no collision sound effects. </p> <p>\"The object is to allow mariners to practise their skills in a safe environment. If they run aground here, there is no harm done to the ship - and no pollution.\" </p> <p>Twelve video projectors and computer graphics can create a variety of port land and seascapes, including Felixstowe and the ship-packed English Channel, and changing conditions are used to test the team work of crews. </p> <p>\"In any group, one or two people will treat it as a joke,\" added Mr Kunze. \"But after a couple of minutes, they forget the jokes and really get into it because it feels so much like the real thing. </p> <p>\"Ships loom suddenly out of the fog as in real life and it's interesting to hear the comments of the students. Usually it's an expletive followed by a large helm order.\" </p>",
  "<p>The last time UK cinemagoers saw Christopher Walken, he was rampaging round a late 19th-century American town, wielding a sword and butchering the locals. His dialogue was minimal but effective - \"GnnnnrraaaaaGGGhhh! NnnnraaAAAAaaggghhh!!!\" - as he hacked his way through Tim Burton's Hammer tribute Sleepy Hollow. </p> <p>Which is no surprise. Measured by his screen persona, the 57-year-old actor is anything but normal. Take the wheelchair-ridden Man With The Plan in Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead, or the psychotic mob boss Vincenzo Coccotti in True Romance. Indeed, many thought his performance as the demented Frank White in the super-violent gangster flick King Of New York was his most extreme - until last year's Wildside showed him whipping his chauffeur with his underpants while attempting to sodomise him at gunpoint. </p> <p>Recently, however, Walken went even further when he came up with an idea for a TV show that was so far out, nobody would touch it. MTV said no, Bravo said no. The Comedy Channel said no. So what was so dangerous about this show? Was it America's Best-Loved Serial Killers? How To Raise The Dead? The Murder Roadshow? No, Walken simply wanted his own cookery programme. </p> <p>\"It was either 10 or 12 segments,\" he recently told the New York Observer. \"I can't remember. I was going to have some sort of kitchen set-up. I wanted it to be a little like Pee-Wee's Playhouse. I love that show. And I would have maybe a showgirl, you know, with a little thing on, chopping my vegetables. Maybe some musicians. And an audience. Some people to talk to.\" </p> <p>If this seems a little unusual, perhaps some perspective is required here. Walken's father, 97, is a German immigrant who ran a bakery in the New York suburb of Queens. Walken was considering joining the family business and often worked for his father, putting the jam in doughnuts, but a shambolic stint as a delivery boy convinced him otherwise. </p> <p>Today, cooking remains one of Walken's private hobbies, and he rarely eats out. \"I'm amazed people let total strangers mess around with their food,\" he once said. \"When I cook for myself, I know what I'm getting. I use good stuff. I'm not a great chef, I don't have a repertoire, but if you buy the right things and cook them very simply it has to be good.\" </p> <p>Since his breakthrough performance in the harrowing 1978 Vietnam drama The Deer Hunter, Walken has led something of a double life. While his screen roles become all the more bizarre, his home life seems all the more normal. Not many people know, for example, that his real name is Ronnie, and that he trained as a dancer in stage school. The name change was suggested by a Belgian songstress, who hired Walken as part of a trio of backing singers/hoofers in her nightclub act. \"You know,\" she told him, \"I don't really like 'Ronnie'. I think you're more 'Christopher'. Do you mind if I call you Christopher?\" Walken said, \"Call me anything you like, just don't call me late for lunch.\" </p> <p>As a child, Walken and his brother did modelling and advertising work, and at the age of 10 he would get the subway to Manhattan with his brother and hang around the TV studios. He appeared in the background of many family TV shows, such as The Colgate Comedy Hour, and one of his fondest memories is taking part in a sketch with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. As a teenager, he pursued a song and dance career, and it was during a 60s production of West Side Story that he met his future wife, Georgianne. They married in 1969, and the pair have been together ever since, sharing their small farmstead a few hours outside New York City with their cats. </p> <p>Indeed, it wasn't until 1977, some 30 years into his career, that Walken began to be considered a menacing movie presence, when he landed a small but memorable part as Annie Hall's death-obsessed brother Duane in Woody Allen's hit movie. Duane opened the floodgates, and nowadays, anything goes. In the last 20 years, Walken's fans have seen him causing metaphysical carnage as the angel Gabriel (Prophecy parts l and II) and disco-dancing with aliens after receiving an anal probe (Communion). Strangely, however, these people can't imagine Christopher Walken sitting at home, stroking the cats, dancing with his wife or whipping up a tasty pasta sauce. </p> <p>\"If I wasn't so lazy, I'll tell you what I would do,\" he told the NY Observer. \"I saw this thing on television. This whole thing with people putting cameras in their house, for the net. I thought I'd get a couple of those cameras and put them in my kitchen and just, you know, turn it on whenever I felt like it. Maybe I would have a particular time of day I would do it, or something like that. And to make it amusing, I thought I would have a hotline - you know, a red telephone. And they could call and I could give them advice about their love life... </p> <p>\"You remember a programme called This Is Your Life? I thought I'd have a curtain over to one side and once in a while I'd have a mystery guest. You know, actors are always coming over to my house. Maybe Joe Pesci comes over and makes his tomato sauce. Everybody makes something, you know what I mean? Don't you think that might be amusing?\" </p> <p>Whatever you say, Mr Walken.</p>"
