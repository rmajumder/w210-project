  "<p>Calais has so much of its finest waiting to be delivered into your shopping basket that it is more a case of pointing out when not to go. </p> <p>So don't choose Tuesday as its elegant cheese shop, La Maison du Fromage, off Place des Armes, will be shut, or a Saturday before Christmas when the tide of beer shoppers might wash too noisily into the haven you have chosen to escape the buying blitz. </p> <p>But on Saturday or Sunday, Maison du Fromage owner Iris Crespo will offer tastings from wines complimenting her cheeses. Across Places des Armes, Le Bar \u00e0 Vins will offer \"top\" wines, with patter to match. </p> <p>On Wednesday and Saturday, Places des Armes has a morning market On Thursday and Saturday the traders move to Place Creve Coeur, off Rue de Gambetta, near the tourist office. Both areas have superb coffee shops that will lead you by the nose to their wares. </p> <p>One thing is certain: Calais is geared to its own bourgeois needs and what it assumes the British want. Hence the stacks of offre special wines even outside classy wine shops. East Enders, the plonk-buyer's heaven alongside the motorway claims to sell from the cheapest to the select. Be wary. </p> <p>The hypermarkets specialise in cheap booze. Wine is best chosen by tasting - the familiar Sainsbury or Tesco brands are attractive if unadventurous - but there are rules of thumb. For example, check a wine guide for good years and avoid the cheapest. </p> <p>Remember, too, the unexpected bargains in other aisles: toothpaste, dishwasher powder and chocolate are half price, and DIY stuff is cheap. Take an English price list as a comparison. </p> <p>Wine at ferry and Chunnel shops can seem expensive, but watch for special offers. Plus Hoverspeed will deliver large orders to your home. Cit\u00e9 Europe, the big hypermarket, with Carrefour and Tesco, and Auchan and Sainsbury on the Calais commercial centre are well flagged from the A16 and RN1 and do their business with a slickness that will empty your wallet in double-quick time. Check opening times - most shut by 8pm or 10pm, (7pm or 9pm English time). And it is worth remembering that they do not open on a Sunday. </p> <p>Finally, after all that shopping, treat yourself to a restaurant meal. Look for Toques d'Opale or Calais Club Quality signs. Meals with Ffr98-153 menus leave you well fed with four courses for only \u00a320 to \u00a325 per head including wine. </p> <p>Of course, dining in France requires you to respect French dining hours, so expect to eat Sunday lunch, not dinner. And remember mussels at a pavement bar chosen by nose is cheaper than McDonald's. </p> <p>\u0095 All the cross-channel carriers, ferry and tunnel, offer packages with hotels. For example, Eurotunnel Holidays (0870 3332001) offers a two-night package, plus Sunday free, B&amp;B at George V, a three-star with a much-praised restaurant, for \u00a3136 per person (children under 13 sharing with adults go free).</p>",
  "<b>Dear David,</b> <br>Next Friday night, I\u0092ll be in a Sydney pub, drinking my way into the floorboards with a bunch of like-minded Olympic reporters. Why? At the Olympic stadium an old man who once hoped the wrong side would win the second world war will be presiding at the opening of the first games of the new millennium. We\u0092ll cast glances up at the TV screen to check if he\u0092s lapsing into his former Dr Strangelove mode, flexing that right arm. Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, sports minister under Spanish fascist dictator General Franco and survivor of the Salt Lake bribery scandal, will dominate what he and Coca-Cola claim is a festival of sport, peace and idealism. Ten thousand athletes, all sworn never to take sweet steroids, human growth hormone or the latest drug of choice, Oxyglobin, will parade. Samaranch\u0092s sporting legacy after 20 years putting his reputation through the Olympic laundry is a games where doping and cheating rule. <p>There\u0092ll be no cause to celebrate the Olympics until we get rid of this crew and figure out a new way to run the event.</p> <p>Slide me under the spigot, landlord.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Andrew Jennings</p> <p><b>Dear Andrew,</b><br> Let me tell you a story. In 1980 a scrawny, seven-year-old boy knelt by his father\u0092s radio listening to his hero win the 10,000m at the Olympic Games in Moscow. The commentary on the BBC World Service crackled somewhat by the time it reached Ethiopia, but Miruts Yifter\u0092s victory sparked a dream with Haile Gebrselassie that gleams as brightly now as it did then. The spark for me was watching Ann Packer win the Olympic 800m in Tokyo in 1964. I came from a more privileged background than Haile in that I was able to watch my heroine on television, whereas he had to visualise his hero\u0092s success. But both of us shared the same dream and it has not changed one iota now. There will be hundreds of thousands of Hailes and Davids inspired by their heroes and heroines in Sydney in the forthcoming weeks.</p> <p>Sport is like society: it would be totally unreal if it did not have its share of corruption and cheating. But it is no different from any other aspect of life. Football hooliganism is not a reason for football to be banned. Dodgy betting syndicates are not a reason for cricket to be banned. Corrupt doctors are not a reason to stop practising medicine. The Olympics exemplify the strengths and weaknesses of humanity; and nobody can seriously doubt that there are many more strengths than weaknesses.</p> <p>David Moorcroft</p> <p><b>Dear David,</b><br> I\u0092m in Melbourne tonight where 44 years ago, Vladimir Kuts won one of the most dramatic ever Olympic 10,000m races, playing cat and mouse with Britain\u0092s plucky Gordon Pirie on the way. That race inspired me. This boy clipped the newspapers and, before wall-to-wall TV coverage, waited impatiently for the arrival of the official film. Then I went on to live my more realistic dream; running middle and long distances for my club and county.</p> <p>Then the dream died. When we watch the track warriors of Sydney in a week\u0092s time, we\u0092ll be schizoid. Oh what a performance! Followed by, oh God, tell me they\u0092re not dopers. And neither of us can.</p> <p>In those days of inspiration, drugs were something doctors dispensed to make you better \u0096 not faster. The unaccountable officials who control international sports bodies like the IOC have mostly avoided any war on drugs, preferring to squander their fabulous income on personal lifestyle perks.</p> <p>These days I look outside the stadium for inspiration. For me, the heroes we should celebrate today are the under-reported community activists in Atlanta, Nagano and Sydney. They battle local politicians and business interests hellbent on diverting taxes from health, education, housing and welfare \u0096 and aboriginal rights \u0096 into fat contracts to build vainglorious sports facilities. </p> <p>You remind me that the Olympics exemplify our strengths and weaknesses. But sadly today, it\u0092s more the weaknesses.</p> <p>Yours, etc,<br> Andrew</p> <p><b>Dear Andrew,</b><br> Why did your dream die? Mine burns as brightly as when Ann Packer won the 800m at the 1964 Olympics. I believe in the majority, not minorities, and the majority of athletes still get by with exactly the same honest endeavour as Vladimir Kuts and Gordon Pirie all those years ago. They were postwar heroes from an imperfect world that had allowed millions to die in the name of political ideals. Sport does so much to bring opposing factions together: Kuts and Pirie represented opposing factions in the cold war. The world remains imperfect, but we have to believe in the majority. Despite the financial rewards in our sport now, most still compete for self-esteem \u0096 without cheating.</p> <p>I congratulate you for exposing weaknesses in institutions, if what you say is true. By coincidence, I spent this evening in north London at a meeting called so that the public could say what they want in the new national athletics stadium. All opted for facilities to encourage more youngsters into athletics. This will be the stadium of many young people\u0092s dreams. Just as the White City was the stadium in which my hero, Chris Chataway, beat your hero, Vladimir Kuts. Chris will be at the Olympics in Sydney. To him, it\u0092s still as exciting now as it was then. And it will be for the youngsters who learn to fulfil dreams at Lee Valley.</p> <p>Yours sincerely, David</p> <p><b>Dear David,</b>Our dreams seem similar \u0096 drug-free Olympic sport. But that won\u0092t be realised until today\u0092s Olympic poobahs are sent packing and replaced by democratically elected officials, a new, transparent organisation and a credible commitment to tackle the problem.</p> <p>Today in Sydney I find the papers full of stories of a torrent of suspected dopers withdrawing from the games because they fear the new test for the endurance drug, EPO. This heartening news was undermined within hours by the announcement that customs officers at the airport have seized a quantity of human growth hormone (HGH). It\u0092s the same drug customs found in the baggage of a Chinese official arriving for the world swimming championships in Australia 31 months ago.</p> <p>HGH is the rocket fuel of athletics, building big, medal-winning bodies. Many track commentators believe HGH powered the late Florence Griffith Joyner \u0096 the exotic Flo-Jo \u0096 to world sprint records in Seoul in 1988. The International Olympic Committee has not fussed itself with funding scientific research, so there is no test. The cheats can smirk their way to the podium.</p> <p>I agree with you; the majority of athletes are not drug fuelled \u0096 but they can\u0092t all win golds. Only a few can and you\u0092ll know the common view in the athletics community that many of the elite performers are using drugs. They will be the role models for the youngsters who will flock to the national athletics stadium. To be honest, I\u0092m already weeping into my ale.</p> <p>All the best,<br> Andrew</p> <p><b>Dear Andrew,</b><br> We\u0092ve never met but I\u0092m a bit worried about your alcohol consumption. I\u0092d hate to think you use beer as a performance enhancer for your writing!</p> <p>You\u0092re right that our dream is identical \u0096 to be inspired by honest Olympian endeavour. It\u0092s our expectations that differ. The extra safeguards in Sydney are impressive and it would be wonderful if a proportion of the incredible wealth generated by the games could be spent on improved education and quality research into better testing. But I do think attitudes are changing and can continue to change. Sport reflects society as it is and not as it used to be (or necessarily as we wish it ideally would be). But much as fashions change, ideology can make a comeback, with the result that we could well be sitting in our new national athletics stadium in 2012, 2016 or 2020, saying: \u0093The Olympic ideal flickered, was almost extinguished, yet somehow survived.\u0094 One has to imagine that possibility because the alternative is to give up on the hope offered by sporting integrity and admit defeat. Isn\u0092t it?</p> <p>Let\u0092s enjoy Sydney with an attitude of tempered optimism. But on the off-chance I\u0092m wrong, I\u0092m off down the pub now. Keep up the good work.</p> <p>Cheers,<br> David</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.ukathletics.org/\"> TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.ukathletics.org</a> <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/\"> TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.olympics.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Idaho seems to do a good job of keeping its natural treasures hidden from the rest of the world. Who would think, for instance, that the Potato State has more officially-designated Wilderness Areas than anywhere else in the US outside of Alaska? </p> <p>The Middle Fork of the Salmon River flows right through the centre of one of these, the Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness Area. It ranks high among white-water rafters and kayakers, not so much for the ferocity of its rapids or the difficulty of negotiating them as for the constant and regular flow of the water throughout its 100-mile length - there are very few areas of slack water. Then there's the huge variety of scenery and wildlife you encounter as you descend from the \"put-in\" point at 6,000ft-high Boundary Creek to the \"take out\", 3,000ft below at the confluence with the main Salmon. </p> <p>The relative lack of really serious white-water means that the river is accessible to pretty much anyone with a sense of adventure - I was on a six-day trip with a group of Texans all of whom were the wrong side of 40, and all of whom had a great time. </p> <p>At the put-in point, the Middle Fork would be unlikely to get anyone too excited - generally narrow and shallow, this is not the kind of whitewater maelstrom you see on all the raft ing posters. What you get instead is inspiring mountain scenery on either side of the river. Even in July, there are snow patches on the highest of the peaks, which rise up to between 7,000ft and 9,000ft, and you may spot any number of wild creatures ambling along the river banks, including black bears, deer, elk, big horn sheep, and, if you're really lucky, cougars, grizzlies and wolves. </p> <p>The upper part of the river is quite mellow, and there are plenty of opportunities to sit back in your raft and watch the landscape drift by, or hang a line over the side and wait for a salmon or trout to bite (although being a Wilderness Area, all fish are taken on a catch-and-release basis). At the first campsite, you realise just how serious the practice of \"pack it in, pack it out\" is in the wilderness, applying to human waste and toothpaste spit as well as the more usual detritus of a camping trip. </p> <p>Camping is in two-person tents, with campsites invariably based on idyllic white-sand beaches beside the river, with a backdrop of pine forests and blue mountains. Meals, cooked by the guides, are also excellent and varied, there's plenty of beer and wine, and it doesn't take long to crash out to the sound of the nearby current. </p> <p>That said, if you take a hike from the camp-site up the canyon sides, there's every chance of seeing a big-horn sheep or deer, less so a bear (it pays to be \"bear aware\" if you're heading out into the back country). Ironically, it's perhaps on a lone hike before the evening meal that you're most likely to get a feel for the isolation and challenge that this landscape provided for the pioneers who stumbled through here less than 100 years ago. </p> <p>Away from the chatter and clatter of the camp-site, looking at the river flowing ceaselessly towards the far distant Pacific Ocean and the peaks and forests bearing down from above, it's not hard to imagine the awesome and sometimes frightening beauty that Idaho presented to those early travellers. Nor is it hard to understand why the native Sheepeater Indians, whose pictographs you may stumble across, revered and worshipped such an uncompromising and elemental landscape. </p> <p>Back on the river, it wasn't until day three of the trip that white-water started to become a regular thing, and I flipped out of my \"ducky\" (a single-person inflatable kayak) at the first sign of turbulence. But, as more and more Class III rapids assaulted us, I was surprised at how easy they were to deal with if you follow the river guide's advice. On day four, we hit our first Class III/IV rapids. One of them, Redside, is regarded as one of the 50 classic rapids in the US, so it was with no small measure of trepidation that I approached it alone in a duckie. </p> <p>All I could really see of it was a vague blur of white water and what followed was a good deal of bouncing around and a thorough soaking. Shooting a rapid of this size appears to boil down to a combination of anxiety and adrenalin, with, ideally, the adrenalin winning out and taking you through. It's only afterwards that you realise it was also fun. </p> <p>It's also a sobering thought that only 30 years ago this was still pioneer territory as far as kayakers and rafters were concerned, and even today only limited numbers are allowed on the Middle Fork each year during the June-September white-water season, so you're still very much in a part of the world that relatively few others have travelled through. </p> <p>The next day was different - shafts of hot sunlight beamed down from above the canyon walls to glimmer off the deep and fast flowing green waters, a noticeable change from the clear, shallow river upstream where you could see each rock beneath the surface and trout feeding on the bottom. Today's rapids would be nearly all Class III, some approaching IV, and at Devil's Tooth Rapids, I was unceremoniously flicked out of my ducky by a wave - more a solid wall of water, actually. But the swim was fun, my pride wasn't hurt, and I'd go back any time and do it again - as would every other member of our group. </p> <p>And if you bear in mind that this was anything but the Red Bull generation taking on one of America's best white-water challenges, it's pretty safe to say that rafting is a sport for anyone who doesn't mind getting wet. </p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong><br> </p> <p> The easiest way to reach the Middle Fork of the Salmon is from Boise, the capital of Idaho. Flights from the UK cost from \u00a3435 plus airport tax (North-South Travel, 01245 608291). From Boise, you can take an air taxi to the town of Stanley (from where you travel to the put-in point) then back from Salmon (the take-out point) for $195 (\u00a3135), or hire a car for the three-hour drive to Stanley. However, the car will then have to be shuttled to Salmon for you to pick up, which adds another $80 to the bill. </p> <p><strong> River guides</strong><br> </p> <p> River Odysseys West (ROW, PO Box 579, Couer d'Alene, Idaho 83816-0579, tel: 001 208 765 0841, e-mail info@ rowinc.com), based in Couer d'Alene, organises white- water rafting trips from mid-June to mid-September, and a six-day rafting trip, including food, camping gear and transport to and from the put-in point costs $1,445 -$1,525. </p> <p>Vessels provided include a sweep boat, which goes ahead each day with all the equipment to set up camp before your arrival; an oar boat, which sits high out of the water and allows you to relax while the guide controls the boat; a six-person paddle boat which requires you and fellow paddlers to do the work; and single-person inflatable kayaks, or duckies, which are easy to fall out of. You can take turns to ride in whichever of the three takes your fancy. </p> <p>You can run the river independently, but a permit is required and these are limited in number and awarded by lottery. </p> <p>For details on permits, contact Middle Fork Ranger District, PO Box 750 Chalis, Idaho 8326. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> ROW arranges accommodation for the night before and after the trip in Stanley and Salmon. However, if you want something a little different, try spending your first night at the Sawtooth Hotel, Ace of Diamonds Avenue, Stanley (you won't have trouble finding it as there are only about four unpaved streets in this classic western mountain town). </p> <p>Comfortable but basic rooms cost from $38 per night and staying here will have you feeling like an extra from High Plains Drifter. </p> <p><strong> Other activities</strong><br> </p> <p> The region really is an outdoor paradise and there's enough to keep even the most energetic going for a lifetime - hiking, biking, horse riding, fishing, hunting, lounging around in the area's many hot springs.Don't expect museums, galleries and trendy coffee houses though. For more details on travelling in Idaho, contact Rocky Mountain International, PO Box 13652, London SW5 0ZR, tel: 09063 640655 (e-mail <a href=\"mailto:100576.126@compuserve.com\">100576.126@compuserve.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>River classifications </strong></p> <p>Class 1: very easy</p> <p>Class II: easy. Waves up to three feet; some manoeuvering required.</p> <p>Class III: medium - rapids with numerous high, irregular waves capable of swamping an open canoe.</p> <p>Class IV: difficult - long, difficult rapids, powerful waves, dangerous rocks, boiling eddies, constricted passages. </p> <p>Class V: very difficult - long, violent rapids, which pose a significant hazard to life in the event of a mishap.</p> <p> Class VI: limit of navigation - rarely run and a definite hazard to life.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's millennium celebrations testified to a peculiar vision of nationhood. The national beacon, lit by the Queen to kindle a chain of flame from London to Aberdeen, was a gigantic crucible on which British Gas was scored in words 11 metres long beneath a crown of 18 BG logos. The Millennium Dome exhibits the work of some of our most cherished national institutions: the American companies Manpower and Ford. Its Body Zone was sponsored by Boots, its Mind Zone by the weapons manufacturer British Aerospace, and its Learning Zone by Tesco. </p> <p>Its Our Town stage, where \"the diversity of local culture is celebrated\", was financed by that guardian of diversity, McDonald's. British Airways and the British Airports Authority used the Journey Zone to explain to visitors the advantages of Heathrow Airport's proposed Terminal 5, in which they both have a certain interest. </p> <p>At the 1999 Labour party conference, Tony Blair told delegates he would \"set the people free\" by creating \"a model 21st-century nation, based... on the equal worth of all\". But some attendees at the conference were worth rather more than others. To reach the speeches, delegates had to fight their way past 62 corporate stalls: it looked more like a trade fair than a political gathering. </p> <p>The conference's fringe meeting on social justice in a global economy was sponsored by the Swiss company ABB, the builders of the turbines for the Three Gorges Dam in China, which displaced over a million people from the land. The meeting on holding government and companies to account was sponsored by the lottery company Camelot. The meeting on renewing democracy and rebuilding communities was financed by Tesco, widely blamed for shattering communities with their out-of-town superstores. When Lord Whitty, a minister at the department of the environment, was asked by the BBC whether the exhibitors at the conference were buying access to ministers, he replied: \"You don't buy access to ministers. You buy access to the whole party.\" I think he was trying to reassure us. </p> <p>These are the outward signs of the corporate takeover of Britain, crude and trivial manifestations of a deeper problem. Corporations, the contraptions we invented to serve us, are overthrowing us. They are seizing powers previously invested in government, and using them to distort public life to suit their own ends. </p> <p>The government shows few signs of concern about this coup d'etat. New Labour, its leaders often remind us, is the party of business, aiming to establish the most business-friendly environment in the world. There is, Blair told the Confederation of British Industry, \"great commitment and enthusiasm, right across the government, for forging links with the business community\". \"We want a society,\" the cabinet minister Peter Mandelson announced, \"that celebrates and values its business heroes as much as its pop stars and footballers.\" </p> <p>The struggle between people and corporations will be the defining battle of the 21st century. If the corporations win, liberal democracy will come to an end. The great social democratic institutions which have defended the weak against the strong - equality before the law, representative government, democratic accountability and the sovereignty of parliament - will be toppled. If the corporate attempt on public life is beaten back, then democracy may re-emerge the stronger for its conquest. But this victory cannot be brokered by our representatives. Democracy will survive only if the people in whose name they govern rescue the state from captivity. </p> <p>My story begins on the Isle of Skye, which became, under the Conservatives, the laboratory for a novel experiment. As the terms under which it is being conducted have come to light, it has developed into a scandal of the kind associated with Brazil, rather than Britain: the Labour government is now caught in this scandal. </p> <p>Skye lies over the sea. This topographical distinction delights the tourists following the flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie. But by the end of the 1980s, it was a nuisance to the residents. Car ferries connecting the island to the mainland kept breaking down, so that people often had to queue for two or three hours. Some residents called for a bridge. The strait, or kyle, that separated Skye from the mainland, they argued, was scarcely a mile wide at its narrowest point. English islands close to the mainland coast were served by roads; was it not time for Skye to be connected to the national network? </p> <p>The Scottish Office, a department of the Conservative government, agreed. Road building was, at the time, a central component of the government's economic programme. There was, it told the people of Skye, just one problem: it had no money. Public funds spent on building a bridge would be funds not spent on the island's health and education. Rather than be defeated by this, it had devised a new and remarkable solution. </p> <p>The people of Skye would get their bridge, but it would be financed by a private company. The company would build the structure at its own expense, then recoup the money by charging a toll. The Skye Bridge would be the first project built under something called the private finance initiative (PFI). This, started by the Conservatives and developed by Labour, has become the means by which many new roads, bridges, rail links, schools, hospitals and prisons in Britain are now built. </p> <p>In the week the bridge opened, in October 1995, the government-run ferry service stopped: the only efficient means of getting to Skye was the bridge. This might have been uncontroversial had the toll the private companies levied not been the highest, per metre of road, in the world. The one-mile crossing now costs \u00a35.70 each way. </p> <p>A legal discovery by veteran campaigner and folk singer Robbie the Pict convinced the people of Skye that the tolls were worth fighting. The toll regime, Robbie believed, breached Article 18 of the Act of Union, which forbids the Crown to levy a tax in Scotland in circumstances not encountered in England. As there was no sole road crossing to an inshore island which was tolled in England, and as the Scottish Office told the European Union that the tolls should be classified as a tax, the charges looked to Robbie like a violation of the act. </p> <p> Convinced that they had a constitutional as well as a moral case, the islanders began one of the biggest and most sustained campaigns of civil disobedience in Scotland since the Lewis Risings of 1919. It started with a petition, circulated by the West Highland Free Press. Though Skye has only 10,000 inhabitants, within a few weeks 7,000 people had signed up, demanding a free crossing rather than a toll bridge. They were ignored. So, when the bridge opened, many of the islanders refused to pay: 600 people - crofters, shopkeepers, doctors, factory workers and engineers, most of whom had never been in trouble before - were arrested. Some collected dozens of charges: Robbie was arraigned on 129. The Highlands police and judicial systems nearly collapsed beneath the load. The islanders launched legal counter-suits. </p> <p>The toll company changed its tactics. It stopped calling the police and refused to let the non-payers pass. So the islanders devised new means of frustrating their captors. Some days they would pay the toll penny by penny, blocking the bridge for hours. They would bring cardboard cheques so large that they wouldn't fit through the toll-booth window. They discovered that the collecting company banked its money on Friday, so 30 people agreed to arrive at intervals on a Saturday morning with \u00a3100 notes and no change. </p> <p>I met Robbie the Pict playing football around the toll booth on the bridge in the summer of 1998. He had discovered that Hamilton Park, the land on which the toll booth and the approach road were built, had been established with a deed that only a compulsory purchase order could repeal. In its hurry to get the bridge built, the Scottish Office had initiated compulsory purchase proceedings but forgot to complete them. Legally, the land remained a designated recreation area, and Robbie and friends were lawfully entitled to play football there, and use the barrier as a goal: \"They don't want to arrest us for this one as they don't want the issue raised in court. We could mount a legal challenge to the existence of the toll booths.\" </p> <p>The islanders discovered that the company empowered by the government to collect the tolls had changed its name, while the deed which appeared to allow it to charge the money remained the same. So Robbie bought the discarded company name - Skye Bridge Tolls Ltd - and insisted that he, and not the consortium, now had the legal right to collect the money. When the company protested, he offered to sell them the original name for \u00a31m, and demanded that they \"remove our good name\" from the documents they were using \"for the purpose of exacting money from road users\". \"I've got a right,\" he told me, \"to collect the tolls. One of these days I'm going to set up in a garden shed and if the police come I'll tell them, 'I've got the paperwork: it's them you should be arresting.'\" </p> <p>The protesters put in a bid to buy the bridge, and another to acquire the ferries that used to run across the kyle. Both were, unsurprisingly, rejected by the Scottish Office, which says that the bridge is owned by a consortium of three firms: two construction companies and the Bank of America. But the islanders later discovered that, by the time the bridge opened, the ownership had changed dramatically. One thousand shares had been issued. The Bank of America had 997 , while the remaining three were in the hands of Bank of America nominees. The bank was sole controller of the bridge. The other companies were employed merely to collect the tolls on its behalf and transfer the money to America. The Scottish Office had twice issued misleading statements about this. </p> <p>The Bank of America, previously known as the Bank of Italy, has a blemished record. In November 1998, it settled with 250 American government agencies which had sued it, after admitting that it had improperly shifted unclaimed payments into its own accounts instead of returning them to the public bodies to which they belonged. Most islanders' tolls are transferred to the bank headquarters in California. Skye had become, according to the protesters, part of a US banking gulag, a colonial penitentiary in which they were held to ransom. </p> <p>They chose Independence Day to demand release from their imperial masters. On July 4 1998, the Crofter's Kitchen cafe, on the Skye side of the bridge, was in uproar; 100 people crammed into it, singing, laughing and shouting. At the time advertised, the residents quietly filed into the car park. Robbie Cormack, a big man with a ginger moustache, brought out a clipboard. As he announced the names of the American states, protesters in fancy dress took placards: Florida went to a gigantic orange carton, with its ingredients listed as \"pure Florida orange, diluted with Scottish Office mandarins\". Mississippi went to a ghoul in a white hood and cape. </p> <p>Other protesters took banners reading \"Welcome to Skye, the \u00a35.60 state\" and \"Bank of America: The bank that likes to say gimme\". An accordionist struck up The Yellow Rose of Texas, and the Independence from America March set off past the sign the protesters had legally and perma nently installed on the roundabout (\"Beware: bogus toll collectors ahead\") and over the bridge to the mainland. </p> <p>The postmaster, Drew Millar, claiming to be Bill Clinton's special representative, apologised that the president couldn't be with them: he had, regrettably \"gotten held up in the bathroom, helping one of his interns to grasp the essentials of the body politic\". But, he went on, \"I would like to welcome you to the 51st state of America, and thank you sincerely for all the contributions you've made to our federal tax-take.\" </p> <p>There is a sheriff's court on the island, but the Crown insisted on trying protesters (378 islanders were prosecuted) in Dingwall, 120 miles away. Because of the caseload, and the etiolated nature of sheriff's court procedures, some defendants had to turn up in court as many as 15 times to defend a single case of the non-payment of \u00a35. \"They are trying to wear us down,\" Robbie the Pict told me, \"but they won't succeed.\" </p> <p> Another islander, John Campbell, who trained as an engineer, looked into the financing of the project. The bridge, according to the Miller Group, which built it, cost \u00a325m. The Scottish Office initially contributed \u00a313m. The European Investment Bank added \u00a313m. Private investors paid in \u00a37.5m, the contractors \u00a30.5m, and a commercial bank \u00a36m: a total of \u00a340m. The bridge was 60% overfinanced. </p> <p>The only explanation the islanders could suggest is that the investors believed the bridge would make a great deal of money, and they wanted to buy into a stake. The \u00a325m project will extract, for its private backers and the Bank of America, \u00a388m from one of the poorest places in the British Isles. </p> <p>So the people of Skye must pay a fee to an American bank every time they want to go to or from their island, although the costs of the bridge have already been met by the taxpayer and the European Investment Bank. The government had no need to use the PFI to build the bridge. As Skye lies within a regional development area, it could have asked the EU to provide nearly all the money for a toll-free crossing. The means of finance have nothing to do with saving public money. Far from Westminster and national newspapers, out of sight, out of mind, Skye was the ideal location for launching a corrupt, unpopular initiative, in which private companies were granted monopolistic control over public works. </p> <p>The people of Skye had every reason to believe that a Labour government would overturn the tolls. In 1995, Brian Wilson MP, who was to become the minister for industry in the Scottish Office and, later, a minister at the department for trade and industry, described the bridge as \"a shocking story of ideologues using a remote place for an experiment that they could not have got away with anywhere else\". The toll regime, he announced, was \"immoral, unacceptable and unjust\"; while the people of Skye were the \"near-monopoly prisoners of... ruthless commercial interests\". In 1996, he joined the demonstrators, marching over the bridge with a pipe band, and announced that the Tartan Toll Tax was \"an injustice which will not be meekly acquiesced in\". In the same year, Calum MacDonald MP, now a minister in the Scottish Office, asked his opposite number: \"Isn't it about time that he listened to the weight of public opinion... and scrap[ped] this toll regime?\" </p> <p>The local Labour candidate for the 1997 general election, Donnie Munro (formerly the lead singer of Runrig), told voters: \"The Labour party is committed to work in partnership to abolish the tolls within the shortest practicable timescale.\" The Scottish Labour party published a full-page ad to this effect in the West Highland Free Press a week before the election. </p> <p>Soon after the election was won, ministers announced that scrap ping the tolls would be impossible. It would, they maintained, cost \u00a330m to buy out the contract, which is more than the bridge cost to design and build. Brian Wilson told Scotland on Sunday: \"It's just a lie to say that either I or the Labour party promised to abolish the tolls.\" When the islanders requested that they be allowed to reopen the kyle ferry service and run it in competition with the bridge, Wilson told them it was a silly stunt. </p> <p>\"What hurts us most,\" John Campbell told me, \"is the sense of betrayal. These ministers were campaigners before they got into power. Now they're just suits.\" </p> <p>The Bank of America has continued to thrive in Britain. Before the election, the consortium to which it belonged won the contract to build the privately financed A30 dual carriageway in Devon. Since the election, it has become the lending bank for the \u00a31bn PFI contract to update and operate London Transport's ticketing services. </p> <p>In Skye, the court cases grind on. The islanders have now taken their appeals to the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. But their demonstrations have diminished. Exhausted and impoverished, the people of Skye no longer have either the energy or the resources to sustain the pressure of the last few years. But they have not given up, and some say they never will. Because their battle is just the opening chapter of the corporate takeover of Britain. </p> <p>\u0095 This piece is an edited extract from The Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain (Macmillan, \u00a312.99)</p>",
  "Militant French road hauliers yesterday refused to ease their crippling five-day stranglehold on fuel supplies, leaving most of the country sinking slowly into paralysis - while British farmers and lorry drivers started similar protests against fuel prices. <p>Lorry owners from France's leading road hauliers' federation, the FNTR, refused to follow their leaders' call yesterday afternoon to end the blockade, which has closed 14,000 of the country's 17,000 petrol stations and caused severe disruption. </p> <p>A second big haulage federation, Unostra, went further, asking its members not to abandon the hundreds of roadblocks or some 110 refinery and fuel depot barricades being manned around France. </p> <p>Providing a crumb of comfort for the embattled government, taxi drivers who had demonstrated en masse on Thursday appeared satisfied with a separate deal wrested from the interior ministry that allowed them to raise the price of a ride by nearly 5% and thus pass on their higher fuel costs to passengers. Coach operators also reached an agree ment with the government and ended their protest. </p> <p>But their place in the growing queue of demonstrators was immediately taken by driving schools, roadside recovery firms and even private refuse contractors, who yesterday took part in massed go-slow processions or mounted barricades on city approach roads around the country. </p> <p>The farmers' union, FNSEA, also stepped up its contribution to the campaign, closing railway lines and blocking major road junctions with tractors and promising to take over on the front line of some 110 oil refinery and fuel depot barricades should the hauliers reach a settlement. </p> <p>\"We are not being listened to at all,\" said the union's president, Luc Guyau. \"The government has failed to come up with even a partially satisfactory short-term solution and we stand by our demand for the abolition of state fuel taxes for the agricultural sector.\" </p> <p>While French farmers lifted their blockade of the Channel tunnel yesterday, the British transport minister, Lord Macdonald, criticised protesting British farmers and lorry drivers who yesterday targeted an oil refinery and a motorway. </p> <p>\"People have the right to a peaceful demonstration,\" he said, \"but they don't have the right to interrupt the vital supplies in the country, or put the livelihood and convenience of other people at risk.\" </p> <p>The demonstrators cut off distribution for several hours from a Shell plant in Merseyside and disrupted traffic on the A1 at Gateshead. Police warned them that their planned blockage of the road would be against the law. </p> <p>The protesters arrived at the sprawling Stanlow site near Ellesmere Port on Thursday night after an impromptu meeting at St Asaph's livestock market in north Wales. </p> <p>A Shell spokesman said their business had been effectively shut down for 14 hours and retailers were suffering as a result. \"When the protest first took place we took steps to ensure facilities such as hospitals were adequately supplied,\" said a company spokesman. \"But the longer it goes on the worse it is going to get.\" </p> <p>An estimated 1.8m litres of petrol in 60 tankers was unable to leave the site because of the blockade. Independent tankers were allowed on and off the site but only one Shell vehicle braved the protesters because it was carrying fuel specifically for ambulances. </p> <p>At the height of the protest, in the early hours yesterday, 150 farmers and hauliers from north Wales and north-west England had blockaded the site entrance with three tractors. The barricade was moved after six hours when the police threatened to arrest people. </p> <p>The shadow transport minister, Bernard Jenkin, warned that hauliers and farmers were planning a day of \"direct action\" outside refineries and ports on September 18. \"These people are decent, honest, hardworking people,\" he said. \"They are being forced out of an honest living by this government's punitive tax increases and they should stop.\" </p> <p>Don Foster MP, the Liberal Democrats' transport spokes- man, said he would be proposing a cap on fuel duty, including VAT, later this month. </p> <p>As the French crisis deepened, Air France suspended flights between Nantes, Rennes, Lyon, Nice and Montpellier airports, the post office warned it could not guarantee services in all regions beyond today, car hire firms said conditions were \"critical\" in most cities, and large companies including Coca-Cola and Perrier said they would have to halt production. </p> <p>The French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, who gave the lorry firms a possible way out of the impasse through a complex tax mechanism that would largely offset future price rises, appealed for an end to the campaign. </p>",
  "<p>One of Business for Sterling's campaigners against the euro formerly headed the extreme rightwing Economic League, it was revealed yesterday. </p> <p>Stan Hardy was director general of the league, which kept files on more than 22,000 blacklisted \"subversives\" before it was wound up in 1994. </p> <p>Now Yorkshire and Humberside regional chairman of Business for Sterling, Mr Hardy was one of 337 people heading the \"Euro No\" campaign launched this week jointly by Business for Sterling and the New Europe campaign of Lord Owen. They say they are for Europe but against the single currency. </p> <p>Mr Hardy is also Yorkshire director of the Institute of Directors, and until last year through his family firm, Caprim Ltd, continued to alert businesses to individuals and organisations he claimed were opposed to private enterprise. </p> <p>The Economic League was set up in 1919 to fight Bolshevism and intervened in industrial relations until wound up in 1994 after complaints of it holding inaccurate information on individuals; under data law it would have had to open its files. It had 40 current Labour MPs on its files, including the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and prominent trade unionists, as well as journalists and thousands of shopfloor workers. </p> <p>Through Caprim, Mr Hardy continued warning firms of those he believed could \"weaken a company's ability to manage its affairs profitably\". He condemned the Ethical Investment Research Service for \"busybodyness\" in drawing investors' attention to whether firms supplied services to the defence ministry, or whether furniture firms used tropical hardwoods. His monitor warned: \"Companies need to be warned what these organisations are saying and planning. Caprim provides this information. And assesses the strength of the threat. And advises on appropriate action.\" </p> <p>Last year, when Mr Hardy joined the institute, he was asked to divest himself of his company interests to avoid any \"conflict of interest\". He no longer has any personal involvement in the firm. A Business for Sterling spokesman said: \"We are not aware of [Mr Hardy's past]. We do not think this has anything to do with the campaign against the euro.\" The Guardian tried to contact Mr Hardy but he was not available for comment.</p>",
  "<p>World leaders will gather at this November's eco- summit at The Hague to discuss the next steps in haltimg climate change. But that's not soon enough for the eco-radicals here at Rise. As our small contribution to saving the planet, this week we sent two readers on a mission to Biosphere 2 in Tuscon, Arizona, one of the largest living laboratories in the world where they will help researchers conducting large-scale environmental experiments on Earth systems. And if you'd like to use your skills and knowledge to benefit the world, it could be your turn next year. </p> <p>Antonia Williamson and Ben Dixon are the two lucky Rise readers who have won a 16-week, all expenses-paid semester at Columbia University's Biosphere 2 Center campus near Tuscon in Arizona, courtesy of Volvo Car Corporation - a prize worth more than \u00a310,000 each. </p> <p>Biosphere 2 has been converted from a rather bizarre experiment to test the feasibility of humans living in a closed eco-system to a unique ecological laboratory and western branch campus of Columbia University, one of the so-called Ivy League schools in the United States. </p> <p>Biosphere means sphere of life. The term originated with Austrian geologist Eduard Suess in 1875 as a way to describe the envelope around the Earth where life exists. Biosphere 1 is the Earth. </p> <p>The 250-acre campus is set in the beautiful Sonoran desert, 30 miles north of Tucson, Arizona and around 200,000 visitors tour the site each year. The campus is a fascinating geological area sitting amidst three separate biomes, created by varying topography, temperatures and rainfall. It is also an archaeologically rich area with extensive Native American history. </p> <p>No other university has a research and education facility quite like the Biosphere 2. The building itself is an air-tight greenhouse covering three acres and 7m cubic feet of volume; it has a unique capacity for sensing and controlling the environment within. Sensors monitor the vital statistics such as temperature, light, humidity, carbon dioxide and other qualities of the air and soil. </p> <p>Researchers can control many of these variables by varying rainfall, temperature and even carbon dioxide levels to mimic different environmental conditions. For example, Biosphere 2 is the only laboratory in the world where a mature grove of cottonwood trees can be grown under controlled conditions permitting researchers to examine the effects of different levels of carbon dioxide on the growth of the trees. </p> <p>Today, carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is the highest it has been in a million years, caused in part by burning coal, oil and natural gas. </p> <p>The Volvo Environmental Scholarships - open to any student graduating at a UK university - are the result of a partnership between Volvo and Columbia University aimed at better preparing students for future roles as decision makers in society. </p> <p>Degree discipline is irrelevant: Antonia is a fine art graduate from the University of Leeds while Ben has a zoology degree from Cambridge. Columbia University believes its multi-disciplinary curriculum is the best way of acquiring environmental knowledge because real world issues involve a wide range of fields including economics, culture, sociology, technology and law. </p> <p>Its inter-disciplinary courses are designed to help students understand global problems and to develop crucial leadership skills. Students are challenged to think critically and to solve the problems we face as a planet. </p> <p>Antonia and Ben have enrolled to the Earth Semester which runs until December 21. During that time they'll learn the fundamental science of earth and ecological systems, examining how science is used, not used or misued in human management of ecosystems. </p> <p>They'll be given a chance to apply lessons learned from the Biosphere 2 and regional case studies to the question of how people can better approach environmental problems on a global scale. They'll also complete a semester-long independent project. </p> <p>Volvo already runs successful environmental scholarships for American students at Biosphere 2, but the company is keen to make it an international scholarship - Antonia and Ben are the first outside the US to be admitted. </p> <p>\"Being a Volvo Environmental Scholar means becoming an ambassador for proactive environmental action,\" says John Pitts, Volvo's environmental manager. </p> <p>We'll keep you posted with Antonia and Ben's news from the Biosphere 2, but watch out for details of next year's scholarships when it could be your turn to help save the world.</p>",
  "<p>My great-uncle Alfred Hollis was in his early 40s when he died; he was a bachelor and had never worked. According to my aunt, he was always dressed beautifully, quite beyond his means. In the only photograph I have of him, he is sporting a rakishly angled wide-brimmed hat with a feather in its band, a high, stiff collar, a waistcoat and a long jacket. He is leaning his hip elegantly against his stick and holds a cigarette in his left hand. Parkland stretches behind him. He has written on the picture: \"The one and only... I took this 15 years ago.\" </p> <p>In the winter of 1938-39, Alfred visited the south of France with his sister Amelia and her husband Albert Emery, my maternal grandparents. Amelia wrote in her diary in January 1939 that they were \"nicely settled in a charming hotel on the promenade of Cap Martin... the beautiful blue sea under my window and oranges and lemons growing along the streets\". She described the distractions of the resort, in particular the casinos, and her \"great difficulty\" in stopping \"my husband in trying to break the bank\". Alfred may also have enjoyed the nightlife, but his main aim must have been to improve his health, or perhaps just to die in a pleasant place. He had spent much of his adult life in Ware Park sanatorium in Hertfordshire. Nine of his siblings had died of TB, in infancy or childhood. Now he seemed likely to follow; he was already so weak that, to his great chagrin, he had to wear a leather and steel surgical corset. </p> <p>I have been told different stories about his death on January 28, 1939. My mother maintained that he died in a sanatorium near Menton. My aunt, on the other hand, remembers being told that, coming down for dinner, my grandmother found her brother sitting in an armchair in the hotel lounge with a martini in his hand, a small drop of blood on his closed lips the only indication of death. Amelia and Albert stayed on to arrange the funeral and burial in the hilltop cemetery of Roquebrune, above Menton. They chose a grave plot, the lease on which, according to the usual practice in France, had to be renewed after 10 years. </p> <p>WB Yeats died in Cap Martin on the same day. His family chose the same sort of plot; the two men were buried alongside each other and their graves marked by plain white marble slabs bearing just their names and dates. Family photographs show both graves strewn with wreaths and flowers and Alfred's headstone has an ornate wire frame fixed behind it, covered with more flowers. Amelia and Albert were the only mourners at Alfred's funeral on January 30 1939. According to the Paris correspondent of the Times, those at Yeats's graveside included \"Mrs Yeats, Mr Dermod O'Brien, the President of the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts, and Lady Gerald Wellesley, the poetess\". </p> <p>In February 1947, my grandparents again made the trip to the south of France, accompanied this time by their teenage daughters. My mother recalled her intense excitement, and the ivory-framed sunglasses and frocks bought for the trip. In one of her daily letters to my father, she described their visit to the cemetery at Roquebrune. All the graves in the part of the cemetery where Alfred was buried had disappeared. Although they went to the local officials and the priest, they couldn't find any trace of his grave and no one knew or would say what had happened to his remains. </p> <p>The explanation given to my distraught grandmother was that there had been fighting around Roquebrune and that, in the confusion, all burial records had been lost. The family was determined to discover what had happened to Alfred's body. \"I must say if ever my husband said he would do a thing,\" my grandmother wrote in her diary, \"he would do it and I have never known him to let me down.\" </p> <p>In the Times of January 6 1948, my grandfather read that Yeats's \"last wish\", expressed to his wife, was that his remains be returned to Ireland for reburial in Drumcliffe churchyard, County Sligo, where he had \"spent his early days and where his father lived and his great-grandfather was once rector\". Arrangements for the exhumation were being made, according to the Sligo corporation and its mayor, AJ Dolan. How was this possible? The Yeats family must have known that the graves had been destroyed during the war. Or did they know something my grandfather didn't? Alternatively, were the authorities trying to cover up the fact that the graves had been destroyed? </p> <p>Albert wrote to Yeats's son, Michael. His letter has not survived but the reply has. It is a kind letter, and Yeats agrees with Albert that \"the position with regard to the cemetery at Roquebrune would appear to be more than a little confused\". He had not been to Roquebrune himself, but says that he was told that the disturbed remains were removed to an unmarked corner of the cemetery. \"In the case of my father certainly, and probably also in the case of your brother-in-law, the concession given was a 10-year one, and should not therefore have expired until early next year.</p> <p> But it would seem that during the war, changes occurred in the administration of Roquebrune cemetery, and conditions were for a time much disturbed - you will remember that fighting took place in and around Roquebrune... they have clearly made a mistake as regards the time for which certain of the concessions were granted. As far as the remains of my father are concerned, they have been traced and are now lying in a vault ready to be taken home as soon as transport can be arranged. But you will understand that the circumstances in this case were exceptional.\" </p> <p>Albert was unhappy with the response. He hadn't seen any unmarked graves in the cemetery. And, more disturbing, he had read in the press that the body waiting to go to Ireland was said by a French doctor to have been encased in a steel and leather surgical corset. </p> <p>The arrangements for Yeats's reburial continued. On August 20, the Times reported that in two days' time the corvette Macha would leave Cork for Dublin, and that Sean MacBride, the minister for external affairs, would join the ship on its journey to Villefranche, where the casket said to contain the poet's remains would be collected. The Macha would then return to Sligo Bay, where a state funeral was being arranged. </p> <p>The Times correspondent at Marseille reported that the casket had been collected on September 6 in the presence of Sean Murphy, the Irish government's representative in Paris, M Haag, prefect of the Alpes Maritimes, and a detachment of French troops. The next report says that the remains were interred on September 17 in Drumcliffe churchyard, after first lying in state at Sligo town hall. Picture Post added that the Yeats family had wanted a quiet ceremony but the government had insisted on a state funeral with full honours. </p> <p>The Times didn't mention that there was some doubt about who was buried in Drumcliffe, but my grandfather's questions were echoed in the Picture Post of October 9 1948. John Ormond Thomas, a staff journalist, had made inquiries at Roquebrune and \"despite close questioning and examination of all the people who should have been able to produce conclusive proof\", he was \"still not convinced\" of the identity of the body in the casket. Local officials at first denied that Yeats had ever been buried there, and later told him that they had discovered that the death had been entered in the register under the name \"William Butler\". </p> <p> They wouldn't let him see the register and didn't seem to understand how important Yeats was. Thomas was also shown two different plots where Yeats was supposed to have been buried, one by the sexton, who had not been present at the exhumation, and another by the undertaker. The first plot seemed to have been reused, although it was now empty; the date on the headstone was 1946. It didn't look like the grave shown in the photographs published in the Irish Times during the war. Thomas went to look at the casket, which stood in the chapel \"before a small altar that was covered with jampots that had once held flowers\" with a madonna and \"mildewing cherubs\" looking down from the damp walls.</p> <p> It was all very odd: the casket looked too new to have been in the earth for nine years, but the plaque on its lid was very tarnished. My grandfather wrote to Picture Post and received a reply from the assistant editor, EC Castle: \"What you say,\" he wrote, \"seems to justify the doubts which our staff journalist and photographer had when they started to ask questions about the grave at Roquebrune.\" On October 25, he heard from John Thomas, who said that the editor wanted to thank Albert for his letter and a subsequent visit he had made to their London office, but they had decided that \"it would be best for us not to pursue the matter further in Picture Post, if only out of respect for the Yeats family's feelings\". He enclosed an office memo: </p> <p> Dr William Patrick Griffin, who is a Harley Street physician, says that he has definite proof that when the body of the Irish poet WB Yeats was brought home from abroad in 1948 and buried with great ceremony in Sligo, the coffin contained not WB Yeats but a man whom of all people the Irish thoroughly disliked. He knows the name but was unwilling to divulge it at this stage. He would like to discuss the matter, and terms, with someone. He understands that we pay generously for exclusives. I told him we would ring him. </p> <p>This note is typed on unheaded paper, although an address, 530 Fulham Pal. Rd SW8, is scrawled on the bottom. Nothing more is known about Griffin's claims - my great-uncle appears to have had no connection with Ireland - but they make clear that others were aware of the doubt as to the identity of the body in Drumcliffe. </p> <p>My grandfather was also told by Picture Post that his activities were threatening relations between Ireland and France. Others agreed. Hugh McNally of the Daily Express wrote to Albert, saying that he had \"gone into the whole affair\" and had also decided not to \"publicise what had happened\". The warnings must have had a great effect on my grandfather: he didn't investigate the matter any further. </p> <p>Some of the confusion can perhaps be explained by a visit Yeats's last lover, Edith Shackleton, made to Roquebrune accompanied by the painter Gluck in the summer of 1947. This is what Gluck's biographer, Diana Souhami, reports: the two women, having searched in vain for Yeats's grave, questioned the local priest, Abb\u00e9 Biancheri, and Pierre Reynault, director of Maison Roblot, a firm of undertakers at Menton; they also visited Roquebrune town hall. </p> <p>They were told that Yeats had been buried in a \"fosse commune\", a pauper's grave, and that the site had long since been dug up and the bones placed in the communal ossuary. None of this tallies with either Michael Yeats's or my grandparents' account, and is belied by the photographs Albert took at the funeral. Biancheri did, however, speak to C\u00e9sar Lottier, the official responsible for exhumations and the maintenance of graves. He then wrote to Shackleton and Gluck saying that Lottier had only a vague memory of the exhumation, but that he thought a \"surgical truss circled with thin strips of steel\" had encased the body believed to be Yeats's. </p> <p>The women hurriedly consulted the artist Edmund Dulac, a close friend of Yeats's, who wrote to Biancheri on June 27 1947 imploring him not to let the matter go any further. The priest was asked to reveal nothing, no matter who came to question him, and to make sure that no one else said anything either. He was even asked to check the identity of any member of the Yeats family who visited the cemetery and, should anyone else ask questions, to say that his duties did not permit him to reveal the whereabouts of any grave. The abb\u00e9 agreed. </p> <p>When, three months later, Shackleton and Dulac read in the Times details of the arrangements for the poet's exhumation and reburial in Ireland, they wrote to his widow, George Yeats, told her what they had found out and tried to persuade her to abandon the plan. They didn't feel they could rely on the abb\u00e9's discretion and were worried that another body might be substituted for Yeats's to avoid a scandal. George Yeats contacted the French ambassador in Ireland and seems to have been content with his assurances that there would be no difficulty in returning her husband's remains. On March 31 1948, Abb\u00e9 Biancheri again wrote to Dulac saying that, though he himself had been unable to attend the exhumation on March 17, Reynault, Lottier, a police inspector from Paris, the mayor of Roquebrune and a nameless \"medical expert\" had all been present. A body now lay in a casket in the chapel of rest and, despite the doubts, would be taken to Drumcliffe churchyard. </p> <p>More than 20 years later, in the early 1970s, John Ormond Thomas, now working for the BBC in Cardiff, arrived at my mother's house wanting to speak to my grandmother. He was trying to trace the mysterious and avaricious Harley Street physician. He must have failed for nothing more was said until Souhami's book was published. </p> <p>In October 1988, the Independent and the Irish Times carried a letter from Michael and Anne Yeats disputing Souhami's suggestion that their father had been buried in a pauper's grave. Their mother, they said, was an \"extremely able and efficient woman, speaking excellent French\" and would never have made such a mistake \"on a matter of such crucial importance\". </p> <p>\"In preparation for the ultimate transfer to Ireland, the remains were exhumed in March 1948 and placed in a chapel of rest. Careful measurements were made of the remains... and the task of certification was made easier by the fact that due to a long-term hernia problem, our father wore a truss. The exhumation took place in full conformity with the rigorous French laws on these matters, and in the presence of the mayor of Roquebrune, senior police officials, a medical expert, the superintendent of graves and other persons of official and expert standing.\" </p> <p>They were, they said, \"satisfied beyond doubt\" that there had been no confusion. My mother's reply was printed a few days later. \"Amongst my family,\" she wrote, \"it is the belief that the body which lies in Drumcliffe cemetery is that of my mother's brother, Alfred George Hollis. My family, including myself, went to Roquebrune in 1947 and found that the bodies of my uncle and of WB Yeats had been exhumed, and on a search of the cemetery neither grave was found. Investigations by journalists discovered that identification of the body sent to Ireland rested on it being encased in a steel corset such as my uncle wore, and was buried in, as his frame was bent double by disease. My father exchanged letters with Michael Yeats explaining this, but the matter was dropped because of distress caused to both families.\" </p> <p>When I was a child this story was part of the romantic mystery of my mother's girlhood. But her recent death made me more curious. Discovering things about her life has meant uncovering the lives of those she was close to and sometimes those she never met. </p> <p>As Yeats himself once wrote: </p> <p> Though grave-diggers' toil is long,</p> <p>Sharp their spades, their muscles strong, </p> <p>They but thrust their buried men </p> <p>Back in the human mind again. </p> <p> \u0095 This is an edited version of an article that first appeared in the London Review of Books.

  "<p>We are in a rush. We are making haste. A compression of time characterises life today. Airport gates are minor intensifiers of the lose-not-a-minute anguish of our age. There are other intensifiers - places and objects that signify impatience. Certain notorious intersections and tollbooths. Doctors' anterooms (\"waiting\" rooms). The \"door close\" button in elevators, so often a placebo, with no function but to distract for a moment those riders to whom 10 seconds seems an eternity. Speed-dial buttons on telephones: do you invest minutes in programming them and reap your reward in tenths of a second? Remote controls: their very existence, in the hands of a quick-reflexed, multi-tasking, channel-flipping, fast-forwarding citizenry, has caused an acceleration in the pace of films and television commercials. </p> <p>We have a word for free time: leisure. Leisure is time off the books, off the job, off the clock. If we save time, we commonly believe we are saving it for our leisure. We know that leisure is really a state of mind, but no dictionary can define it without reference to passing time. It is unrestricted time, unemployed time, unoccupied time. </p> <p>Or is it? Unoccupied time is vanishing. The leisure industries (an oxymoron maybe, but no contradiction) fill time, as groundwater fills a sinkhole. The very variety of experience attacks our leisure as it attempts to satiate us. We work for our amusement. Five hundred channels became a watchword of the 90s even before, strictly speaking, it became a reality. It denotes too much to choose from. And not just channels: coffees, magazines and on-line 'zines, mustards and olive oils, celebrity perfumes and celebrity rumours, fissioning musical styles and digitised recordings of more different performances of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony than Beethoven could have heard in his lifetime. </p> <p>All humanity has not succumbed equally, of course. If you make haste, you probably make it in the technology-driven western world, possibly in a large city - including, certainly, the most prosperous cities of the United States, Europe and Asia. Sociologists in several countries have found that increasing wealth and increasing education bring a sense of tension about time. We believe that we possess too little of it: that is a myth we now live by. What is true is that we are awash in things, in information, in news, in the old rubble and shiny new toys of our complex civilisation, and - strange, perhaps - stuff means speed. </p> <p>The wave patterns of all these facts and choices flow and crash about us at a heightened frequency. We live in the buzz. We wish to live intensely, and we wonder about the consequences - whether, perhaps, we face the biological dilemma of the waterflea, whose heart beats faster as the temperature rises. This creature lives almost four months at 46 degrees Fahrenheit but less than one month at 82 degrees. </p> <p>\"Technology has been a rapid heartbeat, compressing housework, travel, entertainment, squeezing more and more into the allotted span,\" notes the social historian Theodore Zeldin. \"Nobody expected that it would create the feeling that life moves too fast.\"</p> <p>It has created exactly this feeling. The laziest among us have acquired a heightened awareness of time - by necessity. The modern economy lives and dies by precision in time's measurement and efficiency in its employment. If money is the visible currency of trade, time is its doppelg\u00e4nger, a coin over which companies and consumers battle, consciously or unconsciously, with ever-greater urgency. </p> <p>You probably notice most assaults on your wallet, but do you notice when a business makes a grab for a few extra seconds of your time? You may contemplate your losses while you wait in the serpentine line at the airport ticket counter or navigate a six-minute telephone queue that has replaced a human who might once have answered your question in a few seconds.</p> <p>In return, marketers and technologists anticipate your desires with fast ovens, quick playback, quick freezing, and fast credit. We bank the extra minutes that flow from these innovations, yet we feel impoverished and we cut back - on breakfast, on lunch, on sleep, on daydreams. Federal Express and McDonald's have created whole new segments of the economy by understanding, capitalising on - and then in their own ways fostering - our haste. \"Tired of working overtime?\" ask scores of advertisements. A medication is marketed \"for women who don't have time for a yeast infection\" - as though slackers might have time for that. </p> <p>The defining quality of haste is only now coming into focus in our cultural mirrors, as in the New Yorker cartoons: (1996) man getting into cab - \"And step on it. This restaurant may be over any minute\"; (1997) man speaking into telephone - \"No, I don't have four seconds to talk.\" Even Bill Gates, with his abundance of money, his private jet, and his fast cars, complains, \"It seems like the whole world operates in five-minute intervals.\"</p> <p>So who can escape their awareness of the pressure? Not the US chat-show host David Letterman. \"I'll try to be brief - we've done a lot of focus groups and people complain that I'm talking too much,\" he tells his Late Show audience. \"They say it delays the show.\"</p> <p>Pruning minutes and seconds and hundredths of seconds has become an obsession in all but a few segments of our society. In the spirit of Olympic swimmers shaving their chest hair, television networks are ever so delicately shaving the \"blacks\"-the punctuation marks between shows, when the screen fades momentarily to darkness. </p> <p>Yet we have made our choices and are still making them. We humans have chosen speed, and we thrive on it - more than we generally admit. Our ability to work fast and play fast gives us power. It thrills us. If we have learned the name of just one hormone, it is adrenaline. No wonder we call sudden exhilaration a rush. </p> <p>\"Your life is lived with the kind of excitement that your forebears knew only in battle,\" observes the writer Mark Helprin. And: \"They, unlike you, were the prisoner of mundane tasks. They wrote with pens, they did addition, they waited endlessly for things that come to you instantaneously, they had far less than you do, and they bowed to necessity, as you do not. You love the pace, the giddy, continual acceleration.\" Admit it - you do! </p> <p>Still, you have not truly explored the consequences of haste in our culture and in our daily lives. You hardly perceive the acceleration of art and entertainment: the changing pace of media from cinema to television commercials that reflect and condition a changing pace in our psyches. </p> <p>Instantaneity rules in the network and in our emotional lives: instant coffee, instant intimacy, instant replay, and instant gratification. Pollsters use electronic devices during political speeches to measure opinions on the wing, before they have been fully formed. Like missiles spawning mirvs, fast-food restaurants add express lanes. If we do not understand time, we become its victims.</p> <p>\"Time is a gentle deity,\" said Sophocles. Perhaps it was, for him. These days it cracks the whip.</p> <p> From an article titled Ten Tall Tales About Composting: \"A number of magazine ads have hoodwinked well-intentioned gardeners into thinking that they must produce compost in 14 days. Such expectations are unrealistic and unworthy. Decomposition takes time. While producing compost quickly has some merit, no one should feel compelled to purchase chipper-shredders or other elaborate equipment. In fact, even if material looks like compost after several weeks, it still requires an additional one-month maturation period before it should be used...\"</p> <p>You can't hurry compost for the same reason you can't hurry love and you can't hurry a souffl\u00e9. The biochemistry has its own inherent pace. That doesn't mean you won't try. You suspect, without even thinking about it, that any business called Dombey &amp; Sons, Trujillo &amp; Sons, Eubelhor &amp; Sons, or even Harvey &amp; Daughters must be a venerable business indeed. People are not founding companies today, as they once did, in hopes that their grandchildren will some day carry on the family tradition. No. Grandchildren take time.</p> <p>Nor does one buy deep-blue denim jeans with their dye stiff as tin, resigned to wearing them for a year before achieving a faded \"look\". One buys them prewashed, pre-faded, and maybe pre-patched at the knees or seat. Who can wait for nature to take its course? The traditional leather jacket, like a second skin after 10 years of wearing, was not actually comfortable in its first year. You had to make an investment. The attachment to old clothes is in the teddy-bear category, growing more from an emotional web of associations than from anything in the cloth. As our reflexes have certain speeds, so does our formation of memories, our accretion of nostalgia. So can the years of breaking-in be effectively bypassed?</p> <p>Apparently so, because a typical catalogue advertises the \"Been There Leather Jacket\": \"A jacket that (in former lives) has seen it all... There are legends and sagas in each ruck and crease of the distressed, heavy, full-grain cowhide.\" Naturally, it sports \"antiqued hardware\". In 1997, Disney advertised the film The Little Mermaid as \"the timeless classic\". Just eight years earlier it was a new movie. Is this, too, a way of straining against the limits of biology - this rapid would-be insertion of a new cultural icon into our store of classic memories? </p> <p>We humans used to feel like the laggards, with nature marching briskly onward. Time and tide wait for no man. \"In our day of electric wires,\" Mark Twain said, prematurely, \"... we turn it around. Man waits not for time nor tide.\"</p> <p>Some of biology is essentially a pause: sleep, for example. Pauses serve a purpose, breaking the flow. Like rests in music or caesuras in verse. Like the old nightly break in the news cycle and the financial markets, gone in our 24:7 era. Even a confirmed atheist and Sunday driver must believe that the Sabbath served a therapeutic purpose, too, in the epoch when people observed it. Now, of course, Puritanical \"blue\" laws (\"No woman shall kiss her child on Sabbath or fasting day\"!) are mostly long gone, and Federal Express boasts of delivering on Sunday \"because the world works seven days a week\". </p> <p>Haydn may have been the first great master of the rest in musical composition; he used rests for surprise, rests for tension, and even rests with fermatas. Silence indefinitely prolonged. Rest and pause. A rest with a fermata is the moral opposite of the fast-food restaurant with express lane. Modern conservatories find these strangely troubling for some students, who can play the most intricate polyrhythms find it difficult to give the rest its full value, let alone the vague extra time called for by the fermata. They just can't wait long enough.</p> <p>There are enforced pauses in the eating of pistachio nuts; pre-shelled pistachios are an expensive luxury - another fast food - and strangely disappointing. It is relevant that researchers in time-compressed speech, discovering hidden punctuation in the pauses that dot our conversation, found that intelligibility declines as the pauses are removed. For most of us, coffee breaks have gone the way of enforced Sabbaths, and neither transcendental meditation nor the sensory-deprivation tank seems likely to replace them.</p> <p> From a cosmic point of view, the velocity of human thought is more or less fixed - attuned in sometimes useful ways to the velocity of an apple falling from a tree, to the rate of the Earth's spin, to the leaping speed of a predatory coyote, to the gentle passing of the seasons, to the wavelengths of visible light and audible sound. We are defined by these velocities, among others. You could imagine species living on quite different timetables. In fact, you can see them: bumblebees or bristlecone pines, inhabiting temporal planes that barely intersect our own. Careful, though. Speed is not who you are.</p> <p>From a parochial point of view, we could concern ourselves with small variations in human speeds. We do make a sport out of comparative running speeds. If we were the sort of psychologists who like to be termed \"psychometricians\", we could pretend to make a science out of comparative thinking speeds. In athletic competition, technology has turned the briefest intervals into arenas for competition. The margins have become so fine that chance easily overcomes the talent that racers strive so hard to perfect. Gusts of wind, uneven turf, random differences in the lengths of swimming-pool lanes can all come into play. The millisecond has come into its own.</p> <p>Baseball, commonly said to be a game of inches, is revealed by the fastest modern cameras to be a game of milliseconds. The pivotal events occur in these tiny windows, testing umpires' reflexes. No ordinary hand-held stopwatch can resolve a millisecond; thus, until recently, a millisecond could not be the margin of victory in sports. Now it can. </p> <p>Luge is one of the events for which Olympic rules now allow a victory by mere milliseconds. Canoeing and bicycling are others. Millisecond-sensitivity breeds further dependence on technology. Swimmers clothe themselves in Teflon-coated microfibre suits. Bicyclists ride machines whose aerodynamic properties were honed in wind tunnels. For the sake of fairness, when the world's fastest sprinters line up for the 100-metre dash, the sound of the gun comes to them electronically, to protect against millisecond differences in the time of its arrival through the open breeze. Lasers shine on their backs to provide a continuous Doppler measurement of speed, acceleration, deceleration. And the finish line is monitored by filmless, computer-enhanced, digital cameras, splitting time with a precision beyond the reach of human senses.</p> <p>Carl Lewis, at his peak, occasionally lost 100-metre races that he had run faster than his competitors. His reaction time - the time it takes for the starting signal to translate through eardrum, brain, nerves and muscles - was generally mediocre, on the order of 140 milliseconds, compared with 115 to 120 milliseconds for the fastest starters. That one-fiftieth of a second difference now matters. It matters so much that reaction times are now regularly monitored. Officials declare a false start not only if a runner moves before the gun but also if a runner moves within a tenth of a second after the gun - because reaction times that fast are believed to be humanly impossible.</p> <p>So runners these days do not just practise running. They practise throwing precisely the optimal piece of torso across the invisible finish line demarcated by the hairline within the electronic camera. They work on their reaction time. They learn to hold a state of intense, hair-trigger alertness, waiting for the signal - but no one, coaches have learned, can hold that state for long, so they hate it when too much time passes after the set. </p> <p>\"We're talking about thousandths of a second!\" says George Dale, president of the International Track And Field Coaches Association. \"Flash bulbs, noise from the crowd, a pin drop can make a person move. They concentrate on the sound - that's all they're keyed into.\" </p> <p>Can it be that we are finally reaching a point of diminishing returns in racing, a point of virtual perfection? Statistical trends over time suggest that we are, as a species, approaching asymptotically a true maximum speed. Especially in the basic, ancient races between runner and runner, swimmer and swimmer, we may simply be closing in on an absolute limit to the speed that can be drawn in a big and well-trained world from the combination of muscle strength, preparation and technique. If nothing else, we can no longer tell winners from losers without the aid of a very good clock.</p> <p>Between thoughts, there are gaps - very, very short gaps. Can this time be used? Measurable breaks separate the songs on record albums. Some are longer than others. That is usually deliberate. A sensitive record producer will run songs almost together or leave a perceptible pause, depending on the desired effect.</p> <p>Someone, though, must have realised that these gaps are a waste of time, in the same peculiar sense as the momentary fadeouts between segments of television programming. It had to be someone who realised just how long a second can be - not a mere instant anymore, but a space stretching before us as a hectic container, with events and voids, to be filled with milli-, nano-, or picothings. Certainly a second is long enough for impatience to begin welling up. So the Sony Discman, circa 1996, offers a function that lets the user close the gaps on CDs. The instructions suggest, \"You can enjoy playing with less blank space between the tracks.\"</p> <p>The evolution of technology has long been about saving time, but on grosser scales than now. Certainly the cotton gin, the automobile, and the vacuum cleaner let people work, move, and clean faster - savings to be measured in hours and minutes. Now we're saving fractional seconds: a millisecond here, a millisecond there - does it really add up? The consumer-product laboratories think so. They are slicing time ever more finely for us.</p> <p>Other kinds of inventors may be making more profound use of their windows on to the millisecond world. Air bags, as a life-saving feature of automobiles, were conceived and designed only when it became possible to visualise complex mechanical sagas happening - beginning, middle and end - in one-tenth of a second. The creators of air bags were carrying on in the trail blazed by Englishman Eadweard Muybridge, who in 1873 took on the task of finding out whether, when trotting, horses lifted all four hooves from the ground. Could, they asked, the knowledge of time's microcosm help out in daily life?</p> <p>Toasters are toasting faster - pushing the limits set by the thermal conductivity of bread, if you want the centre warm before the surface blackens. It could take two or three minutes for an under-the-tongue thermometer to rise to your temperature; new thermometers are electronic and, naturally, faster. By comparison, the time-saving promised by J F Lazartigue's s\u00e9chage rapide shampoo seems gross and vague: its polymers with perfluorides purport to hasten drying by 30%.</p> <p>The household-products designers at companies such as Black &amp; Decker, developers of the Dustbuster miniature vacuum cleaner, find time-saving opportunities all through the household day. Owners of a Dustbuster need not waste time walking to the closet, finding an outlet for the power cord, or rewinding the power cord. They may buy extra Dustbusters to be spread strategically around the house. </p> <p>There are still seconds wasted in ironing - the heat-up time - which the Black &amp; Decker people have plucked with their new HandyXpress iron, for the \"hurry-up market\". They cite Gallup survey research to the effect that a majority of Americans, and especially baby-boomers, feel that they \"do not have time to do everything that needs to be done\". The answer may be self-evident; the question, surely, is revealing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,366043,00.html\">Read the second part of 'How the world got faster' here</a></p> <p>\u0095 Copyright \u00a9 James Gleick.

  "<p><strong> The Tragedy of the Street of Flowers</strong> <br> E\u00e7a de Queiroz<br> (Dedalus, \u00a39.99) <br></p> <p> As mentioned in our recent series on European fiction, E\u00e7a de Queiroz (1845-1900) is one of Portugal's most engaging late 19th-century writers. He was a master of satire and - inter alia and weirdly - Portuguese consul in Newcastle and Bristol. Discovered among his papers after his death and not published in Portugal until 1980, The Tragedy of the Street of Flowers tells the story of young law graduate V\u00edtor da Silva's obsession with a beautiful woman who is not what she seems: it's a brilliant portrayal of social hypocrisy and sexual fascination.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Martha Peake</strong></p> <p> Patrick McGrath </p> <p>340pp, Viking, \u00a312.99 <br> </p> <p> After the modern Gothic of Asylum, with its sexual obsession and psychiatric disorders, Patrick McGrath has plunged wholeheartedly into the 18th-century heyday of the genre. He offers in Martha Peake an accomplished masterclass, with every Gothic standby in place: the dark tale in a crumbling stately pile, winds howling outside; the antihero, heroic in his flaws; the coldly dangerous nobleman and his hunched, leering servant; the hand falling on the shoulder as the candle winks out and the swoon signalling horrors beyond words. </p> <p>McGrath has admitted that \"I deliberately feed the imagination by reading\", and historical pastiche is a readerly endeavour, uniting writer and audience through shared bookshelves and chummy nods at the correct conventions. The author is applauded for the linguistic equivalent of keeping digital watches out of shot, and purple passages read as literary authenticity. There is an especial danger of merely stylish exercise when reanimating a beast as easily identikit as the Gothic novel. But like the best of the genre, Martha Peake transcends its tics and types; they become, as in that other great Gothic pastiche, Northanger Abbey, cunning authorial tools to tempt reader and narrator alike. </p> <p>The story ranges from the smugglers' coves of 1730s Cornwall to the \"great squat toad\" of London and across the Atlantic to the tumult of the American Revolution. Throughout we hear the beat of drums and tramp of red-coated \"foot-soldiers of the Empire\", the tavern and coffee-shop grumbles of free-thinkers and free-traders alike. McGrath evokes the dream of that \"great good place\" America in old England, itching under corruption and poverty, with as much verve and precision as he paints the reality of emigration and uprising. </p> <p>Harry Peake, his splendidly Gothic fallen hero with \"the soul of a smuggler, and the tongue of a poet\", is known as \"Harry America\" for his huge rebellious spirit. Like Mr Rochester, he is too striking to be handsome; a keen reader of Milton, he shares Satan's self-imposed Hell. When his wife is killed and his back broken in a fire caused by his own drunken carelessness, he comes to London to expiate the guilt symbolised in that misshapen spine, displaying himself as a Gothic freak show. His very deformity is described in awed, admiring tones throughout, the hump \"like a fin... stretched taut upon its fragile outcrop of flaring bone\". </p> <p>From these depths \"the Cripplegate Monster\" exalts himself through ballads of such power that they can hush a rowdy tavern, until he sinks again through a fog of madness and bad gin into a lower Hell, raping and impregnating his own daughter. It is Martha who titles the book, and the story is as much hers as Harry's; from a pattern of filial devotion she becomes a damsel in the deepest distress, fleeing to Boston for refuge from her beloved father, and finally an emblem of the Revolution itself. </p> <p>These are the larger-than-life subjects of the novel; the tellers of the tale proclaim themselves as minor characters, but are decidedly more devious than that. \"As for me, I shall soon sink from sight and you will forget me altogether,\" promises Ambrose Tree, who is hearing the story from his dying uncle William, once assistant to the anatomist Lord Drogo, who took a professionally morbid interest in Harry's spine. However, William's opium haze and inconsistencies lead Ambrose first to expand on the \"bare bones\" of the story from his own \"ardent sympathetic understanding\" and then to wrest control of the narrative altogether.</p> <p> His self-medication against marsh fever only increases his fervour: heroising his subjects, he creates romantic reveries and absurd twists from a few epistolary scraps. Caught up in the logic of myth - and sweeping the reader along in its powerful tide - he accedes to the demands of \"poetic intuition\" and \"the weight of symbolic necessity\", passing on to Harry's child his mark of Cain, the terrible beauty of a misshapen back. </p> <p>By letting Ambrose's fevered imagination loose, McGrath demonstrates the mythologising process; it is this same \"symbolic necessity\" which elevates Martha into an emblem of rebellion at the cost of her complex and mundane humanity. Martha Peake 's great achievement is to encompass both the minute details and grand dreams of life, showing how out of the two we spin our stories. Ambrose develops from a captive audience into a manipulative storyteller, exercising \"the full powers of imagination - intuition - sympathy - and art\". As his tale bursts out of its narrative confines and into his own life, we see the dangerous powers of that seductive sliding scale. And the mind itself is revealed as the true Gothic element; it is the narrator's sensibilities and the reader's racing heart which conjure the key turning in the lock, the ghostly tread in the corridor.</p>",
  "One of the country's leading crime investigators launched a withering attack on British \"gangster flicks\" yesterday, saying films like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels made heroes of people who were \"leeches on our society\". <p>John Abbott, director general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), said movies which portrayed villains as \"colourful personalities and cheeky chappies\" showed no sense of social responsibility. \"This is something that I find disappointing and irritating.\" </p> <p>Although Mr Abbott admitted there was no proven link between the genre and rising crime, he pointed to a disturbing use of violence by minor figures in the underworld in the last two years, particularly from drug dealers trying to recover small debts. </p> <p>The agency, which gathers intelligence on underworld figures and identifies the latest crime trends and trafficking routes, has also been alarmed at the number of murders linked to low-level criminality. </p> <p>Mr Abbott's remarks won immediate support from the National Crime Squad, which works closely with NCIS. </p> <p>\"These types of films are not new,\" said a spokesman. \"They come in and out of fashion and currently they are the vogue. What filmgoers must realise is that the type of people our detectives deal with are vicious and very unpleasant. </p> <p>\"There is a huge gulf between fiction and reality. We can't stop people seeing these films, so we must have confidence the audience knows the difference.\" </p> <p>Mr Abbott criticised three films: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - starring the pop singer Sting, the former footballer Vinnie Jones and the bareknuckle fighter Lenny Maclean - Snatch, which features Hollywood star Brad Pitt, and Gangster No 1 </p> <p>During a speech to launch the agency's second annual report, Mr Abbott also condemned the media coverage of the release of the London gangster, Reggie Kray, saying people were looking back at his murderous reign in 1960s east London through \"rose-tinted spectacles.\" </p> <p>\"I have been keen to illustrate the human misery caused by organised crime,\" said Mr Abbott. \"A graphic example was the dead bodies found in the back of an airtight lorry in Dover. </p> <p>\"But far more often, the image of organised crime is a darkly glamorous one. \"From [photographer] David Bailey's portrait of the Kray brothers, the exotic exile of Ronnie Biggs to the current genre of major feature films...there is a concerted attempt to show organised crime as 'a bit of a laugh'.\" </p> <p>\"Such an image is far from the truth. Violence is associated with many aspects of serious and organised crime. The threat of force is an essential component. </p> <p>\"In this ruthless and very real world, people get threatened and killed. It is not glamorous.\" </p> <p>Mr Abbott said film-makers had forgotten their sense of social responsibility in their desire to make money. </p> <p>\"People involved in organised crime are leeches on our society, exploiting local communities for their own selfish ends.\" </p> <p>Freuds, the PR agency which is promoting Snatch, refused to comment. But a spokeswoman said the film, which opened just over a week ago, was breaking British box-office records for a 18-rated movie, despite moderate reviews. \"It's doing fantastically.\" </p> <p>Privately, film-makers say they are an easy target for the police when crime rates rise. </p> <p>\"This always happens,\" said one, who asked not to be identified. \"When the comedy horror film Scream came out, it was blamed for a rise in stabbing.When a violent film comes out, it gets blamed for violence in society. Film-makers are always the scapegoats when things go wrong. </p> <p>\"The British gangster films do not glamorise violence. They are more like black comedies or spoofs.\" </p> <p>Adrian Wootton, director of the London Film Festival, said Mr Abbott's frustration was \"completely understandable'. </p> <p>\"The gangster genre has been with us for the entire history of cinema. People are entertained and interested in watching gangster films. I am not sure directors are consciously ratcheting up violence.\" </p> <p>Mr Ritchie, who produced Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, has said the 1998 film, which made \u00a350m worldwide and \u00a311m in the UK, was \"meant to make the man on the street chuckle.\" </p> <p>Asked why the film had been such a roaring success, he added: \"Because it's not up it's own ass...I see myself as a guerrilla film-maker.\" </p> <p>The Metropolitan police also intends to write to Penguin Books to complain about an advert which, it claims, glamorises gun violence. The advert features two young men dressed in hip-hop type clothing. One is tucking a gun into a holster un derneath his jacket. Penguin says the campaign underlines that \"books remain the only true conduit to different worlds, different cultures, different emotional experiences.\" </p> <p>Commander Mike Fuller, who heads Operation Trident, which targets \"black on black\" crime in London, told Police Review magazine: \"Among some young people the gun is revered as a way of gaining respect. What we don't want is the American gangster ethos developing and spreading within our urban centres.\" </p> <p> \u0095<b>Crime pays... at the box office</b></p> <p> <b> Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</b> </p> <p> Released 1998 </p> <p>Stars Vinnie Jones, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran </p> <p>Four cockney wide boys are tricked into owing \u00a3500,000 to the local gangland boss and porn king.

  "<p>'He prostituted and falsified history disgracefully... His whole film is one big lie... He was very cruel to blacken us in that way... I think it's a pointless film.\"</p> <p> These are a few of the milder responses from present-day residents of Las Hurdes, a remote part of northern Spain, to the documentary that Luis Bunuel made in their backyard in 1932. Land Without Bread painted a world of poverty and disease. Bunuel's camera caught images of goitred women and ravaged old men, of dead babies, deformed midgets and in-bred cretins. It showed a region without basic amenities - roads, electricity.</p> <p> Most of the Hurdanos, Bunuel claimed, had never seen a loaf of bread. Last year, documentary-maker Ramon Gieling retraced Bunuel's footsteps to Las Hurdes. His plan was to screen Land Without Bread in one of the villages and ask the locals what they thought about the movie that has come to symbolise the area. No sooner had he arrived than he received death threats. </p> <p>\"I went back there with a bomb under my arm and I didn't know whether it would explode or not,\" he remembers. \"Some people welcomed me and said, 'Please say something beautiful and positive about our region,' but a lot of people were very suspicious. I was told, 'Don't try to make something like Bunuel did or we'll kill you.'\"</p> <p> The Hurdanos' distrust softened when they realised that Gieling wasn't trying to set them up. \"I'm a fan of Bunuel but I can understand the people who still get angry about the film,\" he says. \"With my film, the people of the region itself could really express what their feelings were.\"</p> <p> Gieling was startled by how passionate young and old Hurdanos alike were about Land Without Bread. 70 years on, they were all still smarting - whether or not they had seen the movie. They have good reason to be upset. Much of Bunuel's \"documentary\" was staged.</p> <p> Look closely at the famous scene of the goat tumbling to its death and you'll see a puff of smoke on the right of frame. The mountains of Las Hurdes were so treacherous, Bunuel claimed, that not even goats could negotiate them, but when an animal failed to fall down a cliff on its own, he helped it along with a gun.</p> <p> The scene showing a donkey stung to death by bees was also contrived. One Hurdano alleges that the film-makers smeared an ailing donkey with honey and then knocked over two hives beside it. As for the dead baby, she looks suspiciously as if she is just asleep. For all its distortions, Gieling is convinced that Land Without Bread had a positive effect on the lives of the Hurdanos.</p> <p> \"He painted the area like hell on earth and said that people couldn't live there. Franco banned the film, but at the same time he had roads made there so that foreigners who came to Spain wouldn't see how terrible circumstances were.\"</p> <p> Land Without Bread was made during the Republic, a time of progress in Spain. Politicians on the left were as infuriated by it in 1932 as the Fascists were a few years later. \"It annoyed them because it was made at a time when they were trying to bring basic sanitation to Las Hurdes,\" says Variety's Spanish bureau chief, John Hopewell, author of Spanish Cinema Post-Franco.</p> <p> \"In many ways, the film was a surreal documentary. Much of the imagery is dramatic and studied. \"</p> <p>The film is seen as the third part of Bunuel's great surrealist trilogy, which began with the films he and Salvador Dali co-directed - Un Chien Andalou (1928) and L'Age d'Or (1930). Unlike his erstwhile partner, Bunuel had a social conscience. In 1932 he broke with his surrealist cronies and joined the Communist Party of Spain (PCE).</p> <p> Around this time, he read a book about Las Hurdes, written by the director of the French Institute in Madrid. As he recounts in his autobiography, he was fascinated by the idea of the mountain wasteland bypassed by the 20th century. The funding for the documentary came from his anarchist friend Ramon Acin, who had promised to produce the movie if he won the lottery. \"Two months later he won and he kept his word,\" Bunuel wrote.</p> <p> The budget ran out faster than expected, and Bunuel was left to edit the film with a magnifying glass and scissors on his kitchen table in Madrid. Land Without Bread reached Britain in 1937 and was reviewed in the arts magazine Night and Day by Graham Greene, who described it as \"an honest and hideous picture\". </p> <p>As far as the Hurdanos interviewed by Gieling are concerned, the film was anything but honest. \"Bunuel shot it more or less from the scenes in the book [he had read on Las Hurdes],\" says Hopewell. \"It was a documentary at one stage removed.\" Nevertheless, many believe that his representation of Las Hurdes is accurate. \"He portrayed the nature of the area well.</p> <p> He just enlarged reality,\" says one of Gieling's interviewees. Gieling was shocked by the conditions that some Hurdanos still live in today. \"I had the idea that I had gone 50 years back in time,\" he recalls of his first visit to villages in the high Las Hurdes. \"People still live in a very humble way.\" The region is now cherished by visitors precisely because it is so remote and old-fashioned. \"Time has not quite stood still,\" runs the blurb in one tourist guide, \"but it has certainly slowed right down.\"</p> <p> The irony is palpable. The Hurdanos have spent 70 years complaining about the \"black legend\" that Bunuel created around them, but their own tourist board wants to perpetuate the myth that this really is the land that time forgot. The title of Gieling's documentary seems extraordinarily apt. In 2001, it seems, the Hurdanos are still The Prisoners of Bunuel.</p>",
  "Tony Blair yesterday showed his determination to break up the failing model of comprehensive schools in England and Wales, demanding greater help for the most gifted pupils in the state sector. <p>In remarks that will cause unease among the party grassroots, he claimed the modern secondary state school must be as dedicated to the needs of the most gifted child as any private or grammar school. </p> <p>\"Too often comprehensives adopted a one-size-fits-all mentality - no setting, uniform provision for all, hostile to the notion of specialisation and centres of excellence within areas of the curriculum,\" he told a meeting of Progress, a group of modernising Labour activists, in Bedfordshire. </p> <p>Mr Blair once again rejected demands for an extension of selection for secondary schools, but said instead there had to be a further expansion of \"rigorous setting\" whereby the most talented pupils are grouped in a separate class. </p> <p>Mounting his clearest indictment yet of the comprehensive principles of the 60s and 70s, he said: \"We expect every secondary school to do as well for high-ability pupils, through first-rate teaching and facilities, rigorous setting and personalised provision. Comprehensives should be as dedicated as any private school or old grammar school to high achievement for the most able.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair defended his vision, saying \"comprehensive should cease meaning the same for all and instead mean equal opportunity for all to develop their intelligence to the full\". </p> <p>He said the old left had played into the hands of the right by failing to recognise that \"children do have different abilities and aptitudes and schools need to provide for these in their setting, teaching and curriculum\". </p> <p>The government's Excellence in Cities initiative, designed to help gifted pupils in urban schools in England and Wales, is due to expand to more than 800 secondary schools by the start of this term. Under the programme, talented children are placed in special classes, given access to top-up lessons and to local specialist schools if the relevant tuition is not otherwise available. Ministers hope that by 2003 one in four secondary schools - 800 in total - will be specialist ones. </p> <p>The education secretary, David Blunkett, is due to announce shortly the introduction of six city academies, a cross between US charter schools and the Conservatives' city technology colleges. They will be largely free of local education authority control and free to roam outside normal salary structures. </p> <p>More measures to involve parents in their children's education are to be announced next week. They may involve pressing poorly educated parents to take part in so-called family literacy projects. </p> <p>Mr Blair rejected an expansion of grammar schools on the grounds that it would require \"writing off the majority [of pupils] after only six years of schooling when their abilities and aptitudes are not fully apparent or even formed\". </p> <p>He also insisted his praise for private schools did not imply endorsement of the right's belief that \"only a minority are capable of success at school\". </p> <p>He said: \"We believe that all are capable of reaching high minimum standards, and that the great majority are capable of going on to higher education or gaining good vocational qualifications\". </p> <p>Mr Blair's remarks were designed to reveal a new confidence in the Labour high command after a rocky last few months. They were also intended to show that Mr Blair plans to go into the next election with a radical rather than safety-first manifesto. </p> <p>Since the parliamentary recess William Hague and Charles Kennedy have both set out their alternative visions. But with Labour once again drawing clear in the polls, Mr Blair said the party had never had more confidence in its values and ideas. </p> <p>He claimed Mr Hague's policy package \"was quite the wackiest collection of half-baked quarter-thought-out policy any political party has produced for a long time\". </p> <p>\"Had Labour produced such a document in opposition, we would have been eviscerated the next day,\" he said. </p> <p>In a question and answer session, he also signalled a shift from the control freak era by saying the party needed to rebuild its organisation. He said this could be best achieved by developing an internal culture open to ideas and free from sectarianism. </p> <p>But John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, reacted angrily to Mr Blair's assessment of comprehensive schools. </p> <p>\"I think it is scandalous that the Prime Minister should be caricaturing the state education system with a description which is not based on reality.\" </p> <p>And he claimed that the kind of personalised provision described by Mr Blair would be hugely expensive. \"Personal provision requires doubling the amount of money that state schools receive.\"</p>"
