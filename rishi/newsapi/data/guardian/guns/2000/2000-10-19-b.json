  "<p> Against the background of Deckwrecka's lo-fi hip-hop set, 23 Skidoo sauntered on from stage left and began playing the distinctive trance-funk of The Gospel Comes to New Guinea. This unobtrusive entrance was typical of the band's performance. Unflashy and unpretentious, Alex Turnball (drums and percussion), Johnny Turnball (guitar), Fritz Catlin (drums and percussion) and Sketch Martin (bass) seemed overawed by their first gig in 16 years, and they came across as a little sedated. </p> <p>Rhythm has always been central to the 23 Skidoo sound. Twenty years ago, they applied their feral swathes of noise, loops and frenzied percussion to the US funk of James Brown and the Afrofunk of Fela Kuti. It was revolutionary then, but now it is as commonplace as a loaf of white bread. As the \"original punks on funks\" they have seen their legacy appropriated by jungle, drum'n'bass, techno and big beat and extended their reach to UK hip-hop with the Ronin label. </p> <p>Their old shows reputedly used to scare the hell out of their audience. But that has all changed. Older and wiser, 23 Skidoo have moved on, appearing laid-back, mellow elder statesmen. The show was divided on almost generational lines. On one side there was the old guard from the 1980s: Loose Ends' former singer, Carl McIntosh and the Aswad horn section. On the other, rappers Rodney P, Skitz and Roots Manuva took on the baton for the younger generation. </p> <p>For a band that make such beautiful music 23 Skidoo took great pains to present it in an offhand manner. It was as if they were admitting that their work was dull and mainstream. The fire has gone from their bellies. That said, the evening would have been an entirely different experience if the sound quality had not been so awful throughout. Things improved when a brass section arrived for the neo-tropical Crossfire. Dennis Rollins on trombone, Ray Carless on saxophone and Eddie Thornton on trumpet propelled the music onwards with fast, funky playing. Their sophistication allowed them to invade the rest of the music rather than play against it. </p> <p>The rappers fared worse. Skitz and Rodney P hit the stage running, but their requests for \"arms in the air\" went unheeded. To their credit, they did try to orchestrate their flow around the brass section and some ferocious drumming by Alex Turnball. 23 Skidoo's boisterous playing reached a manic peak on Where U At, the duet between Roots Manuva and Carl McIntosh. </p> <p>With McIntosh crooning the title, the eminently likeable Manuva showed why he is one of the best MCs in the UK. His display highlighted his verbal and rhythmic dexterity to devastating effect. </p> <p>The material that followed - IV, Apocalypse, Meltdown and Dusk to Dawn - operated in that grey area called \"the jam\". With little to differentiate these jazz-funk-lite instrumentals from each other, the band could not quite escape that fiddly non- committal rut - I mean groove - that is the undoing of so much contemporary music. However, they did treat us to a rousing rendition of a track that has caused much controversy in recent years. As the bass-line riff of the 1982 hit The Coup reverberated around the venue, you could not deny that it sounded remarkably like the Chemical Brothers's Grammy-winning hit, Block Rocking Beats.</p>",
  "One in five students at Cambridge University has a parent who studied there or at Oxford, according to research out today. <p>Among students from non-selective state schools, one in three Cambridge undergraduates were the only pupils from their school year to go to Oxbridge. But that experience was true for only one in 20 students from private schools. About 40% of private school students knew of 11 or more of their contemporaries going on to Oxford or Cambridge. </p> <p>The investigation by the Cambridge Student newspaper shows a strong although not decisive link between going to Cambridge and knowing headteachers, subject teachers or family members who had studied there. It was welcomed as reinforcing the need for top universities to do more to attract working class and state school students. </p> <p>In the poll 20.1% of students had a parent who attended Cambridge or Oxford; 14.2% had at least one parent who went to Cambridge; 4% had a parent who attended the same college; 39.6% had a family member - parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt or older sibling - who went to Oxbridge; 77.7% knew of a headteacher, tutor or main subject teacher who went to Oxbridge and more than half knew one who went to Cambridge. </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said last night: \"This reveals, more than any of the previous surveys, that it is not a level playing field. If the universities don't want to exercise positive discrimination they still have to implement positive policies. </p> <p>\"It confirms the widely held view among headteachers and bright students in comprehensive schools that it is difficult to gain entry to one of the Oxbridge colleges unless you are familiar with the system.\" </p> <p>Peter Lampl, adviser to the higher education funding council for England, said: \"These figures show the influence that teachers, family and other students at the same school have on admissions to top universities. They show the importance of summer schools and of universities appointing more admissions officers to go out to state schools from which they do not normally recruit students.\" </p> <p>The survey adds depth and texture to the arguments about the admissions policy of top universities since the Laura Spence affair, which have focused on the disparity between state and independent schools and on social class. </p> <p>The sample of 472 students was weighted, taking into account ratios of gender and previous schooling across the most recent three years at each undergraduate college for non-mature students. Roughly one in 23 students of the eligible 11,000 at the university was interviewed. One question was: \"Apart from yourself, how many people from your year in school went to Oxbridge?\" Across the survey the answers were: none, 13.6%; one to five, 40.3%; six to 10, 21.6%; 11 or more, 24.6%. </p> <p>But the mean figure disguises the most marked disparity between private and public school experience brought out by the poll. Among students from private schools, 4.5% were the only ones from their school year to attend Oxbridge; 40.5% knew 11 or more who attended, and 65% knew six or more. Of those from non-selective schools, 29.3% were the only ones to attend Oxbridge. Only 17.2% were at schools where they and six or more others went on to Oxbridge; only one in five were at schools where 11 or more went to Oxbridge. </p> <p>When family background and schools are linked, students from comprehensive schools are about as likely as grammar school pupils to have parents (about 10%) or close family (about 25%) who attended Cambridge. </p> <p>Private schools show a 10-point advantage in each category. </p> <p>Susan Stobbs, director of admissions at Cambridge, said: \"We are trying to encourage people who don't have family or school encouragement to think about coming to Cambridge.\" </p> <p>Owain James, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"There are some great access schemes, but more needs to be done both at local and national level. It proves the case even more for top-up fees being ruled out. We have enough of an access problem as it is.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>TALKING ABOUT A REVOLUTION</strong></p> <p>If, in a few years time, Ipswich are calypsoing their way to Premiership glory while Manchester United languish in the First Division, a few wise men may remember 19 October 2000 and smile. \"That was the day,\" they will tell little Johnny or Jolanda, \"that the fat clubs finally went on a diet and the Premiership actually became interesting again.\" Daddy might then proceed to recount the unlikely story of how it all started when NTL pulled out of a \u00a3328m Pay-Per-View football deal.</p> <p>OK, so a fairer, more exciting Premiership is unlikely. But it's probably a lot closer tonight than it has been for a while. Because the smaller clubs, already unhappy at the way big clubs take most of the TV money, are now in uproar about losing the \u00a35m they were supposedly guaranteed from the PPV deal. And - according to the London Evening Standard - a delegation led by Coventry and supported by Southampton is going to do something about it. Revolutionary talk is in the air: some clubs are wondering about breaking away from the Premier League, and even more are arguing for a fairer distribution of Sky and ITV money.</p> <p>There is, however, a problem. The small clubs need the support of 14 Premiership clubs if any demand for a more equitable distribution of dosh is to work - but at the moment they are one short. Therefore requiring one of Arsenal, Manchester United, Leeds, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle or West Ham to switch allegiances (c'mon you Hammers!). \"If we do not change the formula we have got, we will end up with a situation similar to that in Scotland where only a couple of clubs can realistically compete,\" warned Charlton chief executive Peter Varney today, as the Fiver nailed a hammer and sickle to its own face.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>Free personal reminders, news, sports, weather, horoscopes and lottery results sent direct to your Vodafone by text; register now with <a href=\"http://www.vizzavi.co.uk\">www.vizzavi.co.uk</a> and keep informed anywhere.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SINISA-Y, I SAY, I SAY</strong></p> <p>Do you fancy a fun night out?

And he's absolutely brilliant! But don't just take our word for it: here's some of today's matinee performance, when Sinisa did a quick improv session and came up with some observational stuff about Patrick Vieira and a \"fucking black monkey\".</p> <p>\"I insulted Vieira, but only as an answer to his insults,\" Sinisa told the crowd once he had brought an end to his classic 'Arkan made the trains run on time' routine. \"He called me a dirty gypsy, so I answered back with dirty black. I did call him a black bastard, but I didn't call him a monkey. He doesn't look like a monkey, but if he did I would probably have called him that.\"</p> <p>After the drum rolls and cymbal crashes died down, Sinisa continued his crazy skit. \"Vieira provoked me not for the first time in games that we have played. This time I gave him some back. I don't care what colour his skin his, nobody does that to me and treats me that way.\" And just as the audience thought they could laugh no more, the punchline knocked them off their chairs: \"I accept my responsibilities, but if there are going to be any bans, I should not be the only one to pay.

  "Three Israeli gunships opened fire today during fresh clashes between Israelis and Palestinians near the West Bank city of Nablus. The violence threatened to undermine the US-brokered accord, erupting two days after a self-imposed deadline to end three weeks of violence in which 107 people, most of them Palestinians, have been killed. <p>Witnesses said three helicopters hovering overhead fired their machine guns three times during a firefight between Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers and Palestinian policemen and gunmen. </p> <p>Jewish settlers and Palestinians exchanged fire on Mount Ebal, one of the hills cradling the northern West Bank hub of Nablus. </p> <p>One Palestinian was killed and three were wounded, according to hospital officials. The Israeli army said two settlers were shot but there was no immediate indication of the severity of their injuries. </p> <p>The settlers said Palestinians opened fire on a section of their group who were seeking to establish a lookout to monitor a Nablus holy site evacuated by the Israelis two weeks ago. </p> <p>Palestinians said the settlers opened fire, unprompted, on unarmed olive harvesters. </p> <p>Elsewhere, two Palestinian policemen died in an apparent gas explosion at the Bethlehem headquarters of the elite Force 17 unit of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. </p> <p>However, a police spokesman said the explosion \"was from our stores and has nothing to do with the clashes\". A jeep in the police courtyard had its roof collapsed and windows blown out, and police evacuated both the wounded and ammunition. </p> <p>After the explosion, youths and gunmen headed toward Rachel's tomb, an Israeli-held enclave inside Bethlehem that has been the scene of clashes in the past. </p> <p>In other signs of friction, Palestinian stone-throwers clashed with Israeli soldiers, who responded with tear gas, in the northern Gaza Strip around noon.</p> <p>In Hebron in the West Bank, similar clashes erupted after Palestinians found graffiti insulting the prophet Muhammad on walls near the Jewish enclave. No injuries were reported. </p> <p>Following a Middle East summit mediated by the US president, Bill Clinton, earlier this week, Israeli and Palestinian security teams yesterday set a 48-hour deadline for the next phase of the agreement. This involves a two-week recovery period aimed at getting negotiators back to the table after the recent wave of violence. </p> <p>The deadline was originally set for this evening, but security negotiators re-set the deadline for noon tomorrow. </p> <p>Part of the ceasefire plan calls for measurable steps from both sides. These include a pullback of Israeli tanks from the edges of Palestinian towns, easing a ban on travel that is compounding an already battered Palestinian economy, and the re-arrest of dozens of militants set free during the fighting. </p> <p>Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, said: \"\"Once the Israelis pull out their soldiers and tanks, once the Israelis stop firing, once the siege is lifted, I think this will help a great deal.\" </p> <p>Israeli authorities today lifted the internal closure on Palestinian areas, which allowed Palestinians to resume travel between towns inside the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>The Israelis opened border crossings to Egypt and Jordan, and goods again started to flow between Gaza and Israel. The Palestinians were allowed to reopen their airport in Gaza after a 10-day closure. </p> <p>However, Israel has yet to lift a closure between Israel and the Palestinian areas, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs, and the Palestinian economy from its principal sustenance. </p> <p>For their part, the Palestinians have begun to re-arrest some of the Islamic militants freed at the zenith of the recent violence. The Palestinian leadership also issued \"strict orders\" to observe the truce. </p> <p>Also, the two sides have held secret meetings between their security chiefs, chaired by the American CIA, aimed at restraining the Palestinian militias that have led the attacks on the Palestinian side. </p> <p>Four Israeli army outposts came under fire overnight in Gaza, but no soldiers were injured, the army said this morning. </p> <p>More than 100 people have died since the fighting began, the worst surge of violence since the two sides began regular peace negotiations in 1993. </p> <p>The Israeli security minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, speaking before today's clashes erupted, said that sporadic fighting was still a cause of concern. </p> <p>\"I don't see things calming down,\" he said on Israel Army radio. \"I personally see something more serious happening in the Palestinian Authority which raises a major question mark. Is Arafat in control?\"</p>",

  "<p> Through the small tall bathroom window the December yard is gray and scratchy, the trees calligraphic. Exhaust from the dryer billows clumsily out from the house and up, breaking apart while tumbling into the white sky. </p> <p> The house is a factory. </p> <p> I put my pants back on and go back to my mother. I walk down the hall, past the laundry room, and into the family room. I close the door behind me, muffling the rumbling of the small shoes in the dryer, Toph's. </p> <p> \"Where were you?\" my mother says. </p> <p> \"In the bathroom,\" I say. </p> <p> \"Hmph,\" she says. </p> <p> \"What?\" </p> <p> \"For fifteen minutes?\" </p> <p> \"It wasn't that long.\" </p> <p> \"It was longer. Was something broken?\" </p> <p> \"No.\" </p> <p> \"Did you fall in?\" </p> <p> \"No.\" </p> <p> \"Were you playing with yourself?\" </p> <p> \"I was cutting my hair.\" </p> <p> \"You were contemplating your navel.\" </p> <p> \"Right. Whatever.\" </p> <p> \"Did you clean up?\" </p> <p> \"Yeah.\" </p> <p> I had not cleaned up, had actually left hair everywhere, twisted brown doodles drawn in the sink, but knew that my mother would not find out. She could not get up to check. </p> <p> My mother is on the couch. At this point, she does not move from the couch. There was a time, until a few months ago, when she was still up and about, walking and driving, running errands. </p> <p>After that there was a period when she spent most of her time in her chair, the one next to the couch, occasionally doing things, going out, whatnot. Finally she moved to the couch, but even then, for a while at least, while spending most of her time on the couch, every night at 11pm or so, she had made a point of making her way up the stairs, in her bare feet, still tanned brown in November, slow and careful on the green carpet, to my sister's old bedroom. She had been sleeping there for years-the room was pink, and clean, and the bed had a canopy, and long ago she resolved that she could no longer sleep with my father's coughing. </p> <p> But the last time she went upstairs was weeks ago. Now she is on the couch, not moving from the couch, reclining on the couch during the day and sleeping there at night, in her nightgown, with the TV on until dawn, a comforter over her, toe to neck. People know. </p> <p> While reclining on the couch most of the day and night, on her back, my mom turns her head to watch television and turns it back to spit up green fluid into a plastic receptacle. The plastic receptacle is new. For many weeks she had been spitting the green fluid into a towel, not the same towel, but a rotation of towels, one of which she would keep on her chest. But the towel on her chest, my sister Beth and I found after a short while, was not such a good place to spit the green fluid, because, as it turned out, the green fluid smelled awful, much more pungent an aroma than one might expect. (One expects some sort of odor, sure, but this.) And so the green fluid could not be left there, festering and then petrifying on the terry-cloth towels. (Because the green fluid hardened to a crust on the terry-cloth towels, they were almost impossible to clean. So the green-fluid towels were one-use only, and even if you used every corner of the towels, folding and turning, turning and folding, they would only last a few days each, and the supply was running short, even after we plundered the bathrooms, closets, the garage.) So finally Beth procured, and our mother began to spit the green fluid into, a small plastic container which looked makeshift, like a piece of an air-conditioning unit, but had been provided by the hospital and was as far as we knew designed for people who do a lot of spitting up of green fluid. It's a molded plastic receptacle, cream-colored, in the shape of a half-moon, which can be kept handy and spit into. It can be cupped around the mouth of a reclining person, just under the chin, in a way that allows the depositor of green bodily fluids to either raise one's head to spit directly into it, or to simply let the fluid dribble down, over his or her chin, and then into the receptacle waiting below. It was a great find, the half-moon plastic receptacle. </p> <p> \"That thing is handy, huh?\" I ask my mother, walking past her, toward the kitchen. </p> <p> \"Yeah, it's the cat's meow,\" she says. </p> <p> I get a popsicle from the refrigerator and come back to the family room. </p> <p> They took my mother's stomach out about six months ago. At that point, there wasn't a lot left to remove - they had already taken out [I would use the medical terms here if I knew them] the rest of it about a year before. Then they tied the [something] to the [something], hoped that they had removed the offending portion, and set her on a schedule of chemotherapy. But of course they didn't get it all. They had left some of it and it had grown, it had come back, it had laid eggs, was stowed away, was stuck to the side of the spaceship. She had seemed good for a while, had done the chemo, had gotten the wigs, and then her hair had grown back - darker, more brittle. But six months later she began to have pain again - Was it indigestion? It could just be indigestion, of course, the burping and the pain, the leaning over the kitchen table at dinner; people have indigestion; people take Tums; Hey Mom, should I get some Tums? - but when she went in again, and they had \"opened her up\" - a phrase they used - and had looked inside, it was staring out at them, at the doctors, like a thousand writhing worms under a rock, swarming, shimmering, wet and oily - Good God! - or maybe not like worms but like a million little podules, each a tiny city of cancer, each with an unruly, sprawling, environmentally careless citizenry with no zoning laws whatsoever. When the doctor opened her up, and there was suddenly light thrown upon the world of cancer - podules, they were annoyed by the disturbance, and defiant. Turn off. The fucking. Light. They glared at the doctor, each podule, though a city unto itself, having one single eye, one blind evil eye in the middle, which stared imperiously, as only a blind eye can do, out at the doctor. Go. The. Fuck. Away. The doctors did what they could, took the whole stomach out, connected what was left, this part to that, and sewed her back up, leaving the city as is, the colonists to their manifest destiny, their fossil fuels, their strip malls and suburban sprawl, and replaced the stomach with a tube and a portable external IV bag. It's kind of cute, the IV bag. She used to carry it with her, in a gray backpack - it's futuristic-looking, like a synthetic ice pack crossed with those liquid food pouches engineered for space travel. We have a name for it. We call it \"the bag.\" </p> <p> My mother and I are watching TV. It's the show where young amateur athletes with day jobs in marketing and engineering compete in sports of strength and agility against male and female bodybuilders. The bodybuilders are mostly blond and are impeccably tanned. They look great. They have names that sound fast and indomitable, names like American cars and electronics, like Firestar and Mercury and Zenith. It is a great show. </p> <p> \"What is this?\" she asks, leaning toward the TV. Her eyes, once small, sharp, intimidating, are now dull, yellow, droopy, strained - the spitting gives them a look of constant exasperation. </p> <p> \"The fighting show thing,\" I say. </p> <p> \"Hmm,\" she says, then turns, lifts her head to spit. </p> <p> \"Is it still bleeding?\" I ask, sucking on my popsicle. </p> <p> \"Yeah.\" </p> <p> We are having a nosebleed. While I was in the bathroom, she was holding the nose, but she can't hold it tight enough, so now I relieve her, pinching her nostrils with my free hand. Her skin is oily, smooth. </p> <p> \"Hold it tighter,\" she says. </p> <p> \"Okay,\" I say, and hold it tighter. Her skin is hot. </p> <p> Toph's shoes continue to rumble. </p> <p>A month ago Beth was awake early; she cannot remember why. She walked down the stairs, shushing the green carpet, down to the foyer's black slate floor. The front door was open, with only the screen door closed. It was fall, and cold, and so with two hands she closed the large wooden door, click, and turned toward the kitchen. She walked down the hall and into the kitchen, frost spiderwebbed on the corners of its sliding glass door, frost on the bare trees in the backyard. She opened the refrigerator and looked inside. Milk, fruit, IV bags dated for proper use. She closed the refrigerator. She walked from the kitchen into the family room, where the curtains surrounding the large front window were open, and the light outside was white. The window was a bright silver screen, lit from behind. She squinted until her eyes adjusted. As her eyes focused, in the middle of the screen, at the end of the driveway, was my father, kneeling. </p> <p>It's not that our family has no taste, it's just that our family's taste is inconsistent. The wallpaper in the downstairs bathroom, though it came with the house, is the house's most telling decorative statement, featuring a pattern of fifteen or so slogans and expressions popular at the time of its installation. Right On, Neat-O, Outta Sight! - arranged so they unite and abut in intriguing combinations. That-A-Way meets Way Out so that the A in That-A-Way creates A Way Out. The words are hand-rendered in stylized block letters, red and black against white. It could not be uglier, and yet the wallpaper is a novelty that visitors appreciate, evidence of a family with no pressing interest in addressing obvious problems of decor, and also proof of a happy time, an exuberant, fanciful time in American history that spawned exuberant and fanciful wallpaper. </p> <p> The living room is kind of classy, actually - clean, neat, full of heirlooms and antiques, an oriental rug covering the center of the hardwood floor. But the family room, the only room where any of us has ever spent any time, has always been, for better or for worse, the ultimate reflection of our true inclinations. It's always been jumbled, the furniture competing, with clenched teeth and sharp elbows, for the honor of the Most Wrong-looking Object. For twelve years, the dominant chairs were blood orange. The couch of our youth, that which interacted with the orange chairs and white shag carpet, was plaid-green, brown and white. The family room has always had the look of a ship's cabin, wood paneled, with six heavy wooden beams holding, or pretending to hold, the ceiling above. The family room is dark and, save for a general sort of decaying of its furniture and walls, has not changed much in the twenty years we've lived here. The furniture is overwhelmingly brown and squat, like the furniture of a family of bears. There is our latest couch, my father's, long and covered with something like tan-colored velour, and there is the chair next to the couch, which five years ago replaced the bloodoranges, a sofa-chair of brownish plaid, my mother's. In front of the couch is a coffee table made from a cross section of a tree, cut in such a way that the bark is still there, albeit heavily lacquered. We brought it back, many years ago, from California and it, like most of the house's furniture, is evidence of an empathetic sort of decorating philosophy - for aesthetically disenfranchised furnishings we are like the families that adopt troubled children and refugees from around the world-we see beauty within and cannot say no. </p> <p> One wall of the family room was and is dominated by a brick fireplace. The fireplace has a small recessed area that was built to facilitate indoor barbecuing, though we never put it to use, chiefly because when we moved in, we were told that raccoons lived somewhere high in the chimney. So for many years the recessed area sat dormant, until the day, about four years ago, that our father, possessed by the same odd sort of inspiration that had led him for many years to decorate the lamp next to the couch with rubber spiders and snakes, put a fish tank inside. The fish tank, its size chosen by a wild guess, ended up fitting perfectly. </p> <p> \"Hey hey!\" he had said when he installed it, sliding it right in, with no more than a centimeter of give on either side. \"Hey hey!\" was something he said, and to our ears it sounded a little too Fonzie, coming as it did from a gray-haired lawyer wearing madras pants. \"Hey hey!\" he would say after such miracles, which were dizzying in their quantity and wonderment - in addition to the Miracle of the Fish-tank Fitting, there was, for example, the Miracle of Getting the TV Wired Through the Stereo for True Stereo Sound, not to mention the Miracle of Running the Nintendo Wires Under the Wall-to-Wall Carpet So as Not to Have the Baby Tripping Over Them All the Time Goddammit. (He was addicted to Nintendo.) To bring attention to each marvel, he would stand before whoever happened to be in the room and, while grinning wildly, grip his hands together in triumph, over one shoulder and then the other, like the Cub Scout who won the Pinewood Derby. Sometimes, for modesty's sake, he would do it with his eyes closed and his head tilted. Did I do that? </p> <p> \"Loser,\" we would say. </p> <p> \"Aw, screw you,\" he would say, and go make himself a Bloody Mary. </p> <p> The ceiling in one corner of the living room is stained in concentric circles of yellow and brown, a souvenir from heavy rains the spring before. The door to the foyer hangs by one of its three hinges. The carpet, off-white wall-to-wall, is worn to its core and has not been vacuumed in months. The screen windows are still up-my father tried to take them down but could not this year. The family room's front window faces east, and because the house sits beneath a number of large elms, it receives little light. The light in the family room is not significantly different in the day and the night. The family room is usually dark. </p> <p>I am home from college for Christmas break. Our older brother, Bill, just went back to DC, where he works for the Heritage Foundation-something to do with eastern European economics, privatization, conversion. My sister is home because she has been home all year - she deferred law school to be here for the fun. When I come home, Beth goes out. </p> <p> \"Where are you going?\" I usually say. </p> <p> \"Out,\" she usually says. </p> <p> I am holding the nose. As the nose bleeds and we try to stop it, we watch TV. On the TV an accountant from Denver is trying to climb up a wall before a bodybuilder named Striker catches him and pulls him off the wall. The other segments of the show can be tense - there is an obstacle course segment, where the contestants are racing against each other and also the clock, and another segment where they hit each other with sponge-ended paddles, both of which can be extremely exciting, especially if the contest is a close one, evenly matched and with much at stake - but this part, with the wall climbing, is too disturbing. The idea of the accountant being chased while climbing a wall... no one wants to be chased while climbing a wall, chased by anything, by people, hands grabbing at their ankles as they reach for the bell at the top. Striker wants to grab and pull the accountant down - he lunges every so often at the accountant's legs - all he needs is a good grip, a lunge and a grip and a good yank-and if Striker and his hands do that before the accountant gets to ring the bell... it's a horrible part of the show. The accountant climbs quickly, feverishly, nailing foothold after foothold, and for a second it looks like he'll make it, because Striker is so far below, two people-lengths easily, but then the accountant pauses. He cannot see his next move. The next grip is too far to reach from where he is. So then he actually backs up, goes down a notch to set out on a different path and when he steps down it is unbearable, the suspense. The accountant steps down and then starts up the left side of the wall, but suddenly Striker is there, out of nowhere - he wasn't even in the screen! - and he has the accountant's leg, at the calf, and he yanks and it's over. The accountant flies from the wall (attached by rope of course) and descends slowly to the floor. It's terrible. I won't watch this show again. </p> <p> Mom prefers the show where three young women sit on a pastel-colored couch and recount blind dates that they have all enjoyed or suffered through with the same man. For months, Beth and Mom have watched the show, every night. Sometimes the show's participants have had sex with one another, but use funny words to describe it. And there is the funny host with the big nose and the black curly hair. He is a funny man, and has fun with the show, keeps everything buoyant. At the end the show, the bachelor picks one of the three with whom he wants to go on another date. The host then does something pretty incredible: even though he's already paid for the three dates previously described, and even though he has nothing to gain from doing anything more, he still gives the bachelor and bachelorette money for their next date. </p> <p> Mom watches it every night; it's the only thing she can watch without falling asleep, which she does a lot, dozing on and off during the day. But she does not sleep at night. </p> <p> \"Of course you sleep at night,\" I say. </p> <p> \"I don't,\" she says. </p> <p> \"Everyone sleeps at night,\" I say - this is an issue with me - \"even if it doesn't feel like it. The night is way, way too long to stay awake the whole way through. I mean, there have been times when I was pretty sure I had stayed up all night, like when I was sure the vampires from Salem's Lot - do you remember that one, with David Soul and everything? With the people impaled on the antlers? I was afraid to sleep, so I would stay up all night, watching that little portable TV on my stomach, the whole night, afraid to drift off, because I was sure they'd be waiting for just that moment, just when I fell asleep, to come and float up to my window, or down the hall, and bite me, all slow-like ...\" </p> <p> She spits into her half-moon and looks at me. </p> <p> \"What the hell are you talking about?\" </p> <p>In the fireplace, the fish tank is still there, but the fish, four or five of those bug-eyed goldfish with elephantiasis, died weeks ago. The water, still lit from above by the purplish aquarium light, is gray with mold and fish feces, hazy like a shaken snow globe. I am wondering about something. I am wondering what the water would taste like. Like a nutritional shake? Like sewage? I think of asking my mother: What do you think that would taste like? But she will not find the question amusing. She will not answer. </p> <p> \"Would you check it?\" she says, referring to her nose. </p> <p> I let go of her nostrils. Nothing. </p> <p> I watch the nose. She is still tan from the summer. Her skin is smooth, brown. </p> <p> Then it comes, the blood, first in a tiny rivulet, followed by a thick eel, venturing out, slowly. I get a towel and dab it away. </p> <p> \"It's still coming,\" I say. </p> <p> Her white blood cell count has been low. Her blood cannot clot properly, the doctor had said the last time this had happened, so, he said, we can have no bleeding. Any bleeding could be the end, he said. Yes, we said. We were not worried. There seemed to be precious few opportunities to draw blood, with her living, as she did, on the couch. I'll keep sharp objects out of proximity, I had joked to the doctor. The doctor did not chuckle. I wondered if he had heard me. I considered repeating it, but then figured that he had probably heard me but had not found it funny. But maybe he didn't hear me. I thought briefly, then, about supplementing the joke somehow, pushing it over the top, so to speak, with the second joke bringing the first one up and creating a sort of one-two punch. No more knife fights, I might say. No more knife throwing, I might say, heh heh. But this doctor does not joke much. Some of the nurses do. It is our job to joke with the doctors and nurses. It is our job to listen to the doctors, and after listening to the doctors, Beth usually asks the doctors specific questions - How often will she have to take that? Can't we just add that to the mix in the IV? - and then we sometimes add some levity with a witty aside. From books and television I know to do this. One should joke in the face of adversity; there is always humor, we are told. But in the last few weeks, we haven't found much. We have been looking for funny things, but have found very little. </p> <p> \"I can't get the game to work,\" says Toph, who has appeared from the basement. Christmas was a week ago, and we got him a bunch of new games for the Sega. </p> <p> \"What?\" </p> <p> \"I can't get the game to work.\" </p> <p> \"Is it turned on?\" </p> <p> \"Yes.\" </p> <p> \"Is the cartridge plugged all the way in?\" </p> <p> \"Yes.\" </p> <p> \"Turn it off and on again.\" </p> <p> \"Okay,\" he says, and goes back downstairs. </p> <p>*** </p> <p>Through the family room window, in the middle of the white-silver screen, my father was in his suit, a gray suit, dressed for work. Beth paused in the entrance between the kitchen and the family room and watched. The trees in the yard across the street were huge, gray-trunked, high-limbed, the short grass on the lawn yellowed, spotted with fall leaves. He did not move. His suit, even with him kneeling, leaning forward, was loose on his shoulders and back. He had lost so much weight. A car went by, a gray blur. She waited for him to get up. </p> <p>You should see the area where her stomach was. It's grown like a pumpkin. Round, bloated. It's odd - they removed the stomach, and some of the surrounding area if I remember correctly, but even with the removal of so much thereabouts, she looks pregnant. You can see it, the bulge, even under the blanket. I'm assuming it's the cancer, but I haven't asked my mother, or Beth. Was it the bloating of the starving child? I don't know. I don't ask questions. Before, when I said that I asked questions, I lied. </p> <p> The nose has at this point been bleeding for about ten minutes. She had had one nosebleed before, two weeks ago maybe, and Beth could not make it stop, so she and Beth had gone to the emergency room. The hospital people had kept her for two days. Her oncologist, who sometimes we liked and sometimes we did not, came and visited and glanced at stainless steel charts and chatted on the side of the bed-he has been her oncologist for many years. They gave her new blood and had monitored her white blood cell count. They had wanted to keep her longer, but she had insisted on going home; she was terrified of being in there, was finished with hospitals. </p> <p> She had come out feeling defeated, stripped, and now, safely at home, she did not want to go back. She had made me and Beth promise that she would never have to go back. We had promised. </p> <p> \"Okay,\" we said. </p> <p> \"I'm serious,\" she said. </p> <p> \"Okay,\" we said. </p> <p> I push her forehead as far back as possible. The arm of the couch is soft and pliable. </p> <p> She spits. She is used to the spitting, but still makes strained, soft vomiting noises. </p> <p> \"Does it hurt?\" I ask. </p> <p> \"Does what hurt?\" </p> <p> \"The spitting.\" </p> <p> \"No, it feels good, stupid.\" </p> <p> \"Sorry.\" </p> <p> A family walks by outside, two parents, a small child in snow-pants and a parka, a stroller. They do not look through our window. It is hard to tell if they know. They might know but are being polite. People know. </p> <p> My mother likes to have the curtains open so she can see the yard and the street. During the day it is often very bright outside, and though the brightness is visible from inside the family room, somehow the light does not travel effectively into the family room, in terms of bringing to the family room any noticeable illumination. I am not a proponent of the curtains being open. </p> <p> Some people know. Of course they know. </p> <p> People know. </p> <p> Everyone knows. </p> <p> Everyone is talking. Waiting. </p> <p> I have plans for them, the nosy, the inquisitive, the pitying, have developed elaborate fantasies for those who would see us as grotesque, pathetic, our situation gossip fodder. I picture strangulations-Tsk tsk, I hear she's - GURGLE! - neck-breakings - what will happen to that poor little bo-CRACK! - I picture kicking bodies as they lie curled on the ground, spitting blood as they - Jesus Christ, Jesus fucking Christ, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - beg for mercy. I lift them over my head and then bring them down, break them over my knee, their spines like dowels of balsa. Can't you see it? I push offenders into giant vats of acid and watch them struggle, scream as the acid burns, breaks them apart. My hands fly into them, breaking their skin - I pull out hearts and intestines and toss them aside. I do head-crushings, beheadings, some work with baseball bats-the variety and degree of punishment depending on the offender and the offense. Those whom I don't like or my mother doesn't like in the first place get the worst - usually long, drawn-out strangulations, faces of red then purple then mauve. Those I barely know, like the family that just walked by, are spared the worst-nothing personal. I'll run them over with my car. </p> <p> We are both distantly worried about the bleeding nose, my mother and I, but are for the time being working under the assumption that the nose will stop bleeding. While I hold her nose she holds the half-moon receptacle as it rests on the upper portion of her chest, under her chin. </p> <p> Just then I have a great idea. I try to get her to talk funny, the way people talk when their nose is being held. </p> <p> \"Please?\" I say. </p> <p> \"No,\" she says. </p> <p> \"C'mon.\" </p> <p> \"Cut it out.\" </p> <p> \"What?\" </p> <p>My mother's hands are veiny and strong. Her neck has veins. Her back has freckles. She used to do a trick where it looked like she would be pulling off her thumb, when in fact she was not. Do you know this trick? Part of one's right thumb is made to look like part of one's left hand, and then is slid up and down the index finger of the left finger-attached, then detached. It's an unsettling trick, and more so when my mother used to do it, because she did it in a way where her hands sort of shook, vibrated, her neck's veins protruding and taut, her face gripped with the strain plausibly attendant to pulling off one's finger. As children, we watched with both glee and terror. We knew it was not real, we had seen it dozens of times, but its power was never diminished, because my mother's was a uniquely physical presence - she was all skin and muscles. We would make her do the trick for our friends, who were also horrified and enthralled. But kids loved her. Everyone knew her from school - she directed the plays in grade school, would take in kids who were going through divorces, knew and loved and was not shy about hugging any of them, especially the shy ones - there was an effortless kind of understanding, an utter lack of doubt about what she was doing that put people at ease, so unlike some of the mothers, so brittle and unsure. Of course, if she didn't like someone, that kid knew it. Like Dean Baldwin, the beefy, dirty-blond boy up the block, who would stand in the street and, unprovoked, give her the finger as she drove by. \"Bad kid,\" she would say, and she meant it - she had an inner hardness that under no circumstances did you want to trifle with - and would have him struck from her list until the second he might say sorry (Dean unfortunately did not), at which time he would have gotten a hug like anyone else. </p> <p>As strong as she was physically, most of the power was in her eyes, small and blue, and when she squinted, she would squint with a murderous intensity that meant, unmistakably, that, if pushed, she would deliver on her stare's implied threat, that to protect what she cared about, she would not stop, that she would run right over you. But she wore her strength casually, had a trusting carelessness with her flesh and muscles. She would cut herself while slicing vegetables, cut the living shit out of her finger, usually her thumb, and it would bleed everywhere, on the tomatoes, the cutting board, in the sink, while we watched at her waist, awed, scared she would die. But she would just grimace, wash the thumb clean under the tap, wrap the thumb in a paper towel and keep cutting, while the blood slowly soaked through the paper towel, crawling, as blood crawls, outward from the wound's wet center. </p>",
  "The British actor Liz Hurley has made a formal apology to the US screen actors' union for shooting an Estee Lauder commercial that broke its strike, and has also made a \"significant\" donation to the strike fund. <p>Her move follows the scrawling of \"scab\" on posters for the film Bedazzled, in which she plays the devil, and picketing of her at the film's premiere in Los Angeles on Tuesday night.</p> <p>\"She is making the contribution happily and freely to support the union,\" said Loren Plotkin, Hurley's lawyer, yesterday. \"She has been really embarrassed over this. She really wants to put this behind her.\"</p> <p>In April the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists went on strike over a proposed cut in rates paid to members appearing in commercials, and were monitoring to see if any ads had been made after the strike was called. When Hurley's ad appeared in June, she was called to account by the strikers; she made a statement claiming to have been unaware of the dispute. Since then she has made repeated attempts to convince the unions that no breach of the strike was intended. Ms Plotkin said that the agency concerned had not informed Hurley at the time that the work was non-union.</p> <p>The donation and formal apology were seen as a move to stop the sniping from union activists, not least the ones who have been defacing the posters for the remake Bedazzled. Hurley has been working hard to promote the film in the US and has received much friendly pre-publicity.</p> <p>Yesterday the guild made it clear she would still have to appear before a disciplinary committee. \"She has expressed her regret in a letter to the union but she is definitely going to have to appear before a trial board,\" Jerre Hookey, the guild's national strike coordinator, told Variety, the US entertainment industry paper.</p>",
  "<p>\u0095 The makers of <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0146316\">Tomb Raider</a>, who have just re-located to Cambodia to film in the world-famous Angkor temples, have been told they can't shoot guns in any of the scenes filmed there. Cambodia's ministry of culture are still having problems attracting tourism, three decades after the civil war and are worried that gun-touting scenes will only reinforce images of the country as violent and strife-torn. Despite Lara Croft's action hero image and her personal arsenal of weapons, including grenade launchers and flame-throwers, Paramount Pictures have promised to portray Cambodia in the film as a \"beautiful haven of peace and tranquillity\".</p> <p>\u0095 Controversial French film Baise-Moi, which caused huge ructions when it was released there <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,339973,00.html\">earlier this year</a>, looks likely to be released in Britain. The explicit story of two women who set out on a sex and murder spree after one of them is brutally raped, triggered uproar in France after courts cancelled its exhibition permit. The French government reinstated an 18 certificate after film-makers protested and many cinemas refused to pull the film, claiming freedom of expression. The film's UK release will be a test for Britain's newly relaxed film censorship laws, announced in September after a survey which found that adults wanted to watch films without excessive intervention, but wanted more protection for children. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have finally fixed a date and venue for their forthcoming wedding. - November 18 at the Plaza Hotel in New York, according to <a href=\" http://uk.news.yahoo.com/001019/80/ammhd.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Yahoo!

  "<p>After four straight days of construction work on the international space station's exterior, the crew of space shuttle Discovery now have other plans inside the outpost. </p> <p>The astronauts planned to float a few supplies in and out of the soon-to-be-inhabited station and test a new set of motion-control gyroscopes, which help aim the spacecraft. </p> <p>Their other tasks included taking air samples, snapping a few pictures and leaving a message for the station's first permanent residents, scheduled to move in early next month. Discovery will undock from the station Friday.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Astronauts Michael Lopez-Alegria and Jeff Wisoff conducted the mission's fourth and final spacewalk in as many days, and it appeared Nasa had saved the best task for last: testing out a rescue jetpack. </p> <p>Toward the end of their seven hours outside the station, the two took turns practicing spins, turns and rolls with the mini-jetpacks, built to keep an astronaut from being lost in space. </p> <p>Tethered loosely all the while, each man flew a 50-foot path from the station to the rear of the shuttle cargo bay to see how well the backpack rockets worked. </p> <p>\"Oh man, this is so friggin' unbelievable,\" Lopez-Alegria called out as he concluded his test flight 240 miles above the Florida Keys. </p> <p>For both, the experience was akin to waiting in a very long line for a roller coaster - they trained 15 hours in Nasa's virtual reality lab for what amounted to just minutes of flight. </p> <p>Though video downlink has been severely limited this mission because of a failed shuttle antenna, the few snippets beamed down Wednesday were almost enough to make up for it. </p> <p>In sometimes grainy video, Wisoff could be seen jetting to the rear of the shuttle's cargo bay, the 140-foot space station towering behind him in the blackness. Headlights mounted above his shoulders beamed orange-yellow halos over his darkened space suit. </p> <p>\"It was just an incredible feeling of being a human satellite, moving around the Earth at 25,000 feet per second. Really an incredible experience,\" Wisoff later remarked to Mission Control. </p> <p>While his crewmates worked outside, astronaut Bill McArthur offered a bit of perspective about humankind's progress in aviation. </p> <p>\"It's pretty cool, we just flew by the outer banks of North Carolina and, of course, 97 years ago that's where the Wright Brothers first started all this stuff,\" said McArthur, who considers Wakulla, North Carolina, home. </p> <p>McArthur carried to orbit a swatch of fabric from the Wright Brothers' first flyer and some sand from Kill Devil Hill, the scrubby dune near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where Orville Wright ushered in modern aviation with a 120-foot flight on December 17, 1903.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Careful with your card</strong></p> <p> Picture this: you're at the end of a good night out and feeling munificent. As a parting gesture you note your credit card details on a Post-it and leave it on the table top to cheer up the next diner. </p> <p>Unlikely? Well, what about this: you sign your visa slip, the waiter detaches your copy and since your pocket is already cluttered with old rail tickets, you leave it in the dish along with the loose change and mint imperials. </p> <p>Now here's the scary bit: there is no difference between the two scenarios, as RS Kerley discovered. When he tried to make a telephone transaction using his switch card he was surprised to be told that his bank account was empty. He telephoned the bank and learned that \u00a3326 had recently been paid out to a company he'd never heard of. </p> <p>Given that the card had not left Kerley's wallet, the bank concluded that he might have left the receipt from a switch card purchase lying around with his name, card number and the expiry date printed on it. That's all the information needed for someone to make telephone transactions without ever laying hands on the card itself. </p> <p>\u0095Buyers beware. This type of fraud is on the increase as shopkeepers are now more vigilant about face-to- face credit card transactions. There's an equal risk that your friendly waiter might jot down your card details for his own use when he bears it off to the back room. </p> <p>\"There's a growing pressure on organisations to leave out some of the data that appear on receipts, but international card scheme rules do insist that certain numbers have to be included,\" says a spokesman for the Association of Payment Clearing Services. </p> <p>\"There are, however, moves to introduce a verification code, which won't appear on the receipt and means that purchasers will have to have their cards in front of them before making telephone transactions.\" </p> <p>If the worst does happen, your bank may be liable for the costs of the fraud, but not if it can prove that you were negligent. To be on the safe side, always take your transaction slips home with you. </p> <p><strong> Virgin discrimination</strong> </p> <p> Our story last week about Virgin's 520% price hike on a London to Lancaster train jolted a number of commuters out of their slumbers. Alvin Cohan of London was, we reported, incensed to find that the \u00a325 saver fare he'd booked each week for the past three years had been banished from the 8.35am from Euston. Instead he was obliged to find \u00a3155. Virgin initially blamed heavy commuter use, but reassessed the service after Consumer's call and restored the old fare. Unfair, wails Ian Reader of Lancaster. \"Why,\" he asks, \"does Virgin continue to charge people travelling before 9am in the other direction \u00a3155? Isn't this discrimination?\" </p> <p>\u0095No, it's responsible business management, says Virgin. \"Fares tend to be calculated train- by-train rather than route-by-route and are determined by the level of business traffic on each service,\" explains a spokesman. </p> <p>\"Trains to London are heavily used at peak time and if we didn't restrict saver tickets, leisure travellers would crowd out those who need to get to work.\" There you are Mr Reader, you should be grateful that you have the chance to pay a \u00a3130 supplement to secure a seat! </p> <p><strong> More Virgin woes</strong> </p> <p> Martin Wright of Parbold in Lancashire says he had the same experience as Alvin Cohan, but no such happy ending. For the past few years he has caught the 6.14am from Wigan to London each Monday and paid \u00a320 for a saver fare. </p> <p>Suddenly, however, this ticket was withdrawn and he was left with a standard return at \u00a3143. As usual, Virgin argued that it was because the train was much used by business travellers and it was therefore losing potential revenue. Now, Wright says, it's three-quarters empty - so where's the gain in that? </p> <p>Up in Preston, Phil Brown is raging over the withdrawal of all fare discounts from services leaving for London before 9.20am. Even then, it's only possible to buy a Business Saver costing a distressing \u00a3100 - Saver tickets aren't available until 10.20 which means, Brown concludes, that Virgin defines peak period as lasting until 12.15, the time the 9.20 gets into London. \"I understand that the reason Virgin gives for stopping the cheap advance tickets last month is that it is working from its winter timetable. Apparently people do not wish to purchase cheap tickets in 'winter'.\" </p> <p>\u0095Consumer invited Virgin to comment but its reply, like so many of its trains, has been delayed. By the way, if any of you experienced the eccentricities of the privatised fare system - which can make it cheaper to buy, say, two or three tickets for each stage of a journey rather than one through ticket - we'd like to hear from you. </p> <p><strong> Vanishing tickets</strong> </p> <p> Poor Graham Wigmore never even saw the tickets he'd paid for. Thames Trains assured him they'd been posted and said their non-arrival was not its problem.

  "<p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer is the most widely-used web browser in the world - and also one that leaves users open to a fair few security problems, according to bug hunter Georgi Guninski. He has found a bug in the latest version, IE 5.5, that could allow people to read files and even execute programs on anybody's computer. </p> <p>The problem arises when Java is used at the same time as ActiveX. Nobody has reported being hacked in this way yet, but Microsoft has posted an explanation and fix at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-075.asp\">www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-075.asp </a>. </p> <p>Something for which MS has suggested a workaround is Windows Me and Windows 98SE, despite denials that the operating systems themselves are at fault. It seems that on certain extremely fast machines - Athlon or Pentium III, running at 900MHz or more - they shut down too quickly for applications to save anything that is in cache memory. </p> <p>The way around this is simply to shut down all your applications before closing the system or accept that going to start-Shutdown from within a file may lead to loss of data. </p> <p>There is also a problem with the WebTV software that comes with Windows 98SE and Windows. Hackers can send computers information while WebTV is running and cause the system to crash. Microsoft was made aware of this problem a month or so ago but has only just acknowledged its seriousness and put patches on its website - one for Windows 98 and one for Windows Me. </p> <p>These are also available free at http://news.cnet.com/ news/0-1006-200-3176203. html?tag=st.ne.1430735..ni </p> <p> It should be noted that this bug is in the Windows WebTV software and not in third party offerings with similar names. </p> <p>Before any devotees of the non-Windows environments start gloating too much, they need to remember that Linux also has problems. A couple of releases - specifically Red Hat Linux 7.0 - i386 and Red Hat Linux 7.0J - i386 - contain a daemon, called rhnsd, which leaks file descriptors. </p> <p>Linux installation and fixing is complex stuff, but the way to get rid of this is to enter the following commands: </p> <p> /sbin/service rhnsd stop </p> <p>/sinb/chkconfig --level 345 </p> <p>rhnsd off </p> <p> And that should clear the problem. There are other manual ways of clearing the difficulty up, all of which have been circulated on the various Linux newsgroups and mailing lists. </p> <p>While we're on the subject of Linux, it seems the Apache HTTP server has a flaw that can allow hackers to look at random files on a PC. The trouble stems from a module called mod_rewrite, which rewrites URLs for the client computer before further processing takes place. </p> <p>If you're running OpenLinux Desktop 2.3 with any Apache package prior to 1.3.4-5, OpenLinux eServer 2.3 and OpenLinux eBuilder running any package prior to apache-1.3.9-5S or OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 running any package that came out before Apache-1.3.11-2D then you could be hit. </p> <p>The workaround, until you have an upgrade, is not to enable mod_rewrite. If you already use it then there's an upgrade package available at f tp://ftp.calderasystems.com/ pub/updates/OpenLinux/2.3/ current/RPMS/ , while the corresponding source code package is at ftp://ftp. calderasystems.com/ pub/updates/eServer/2.3/ current/SRPMS </p> <p> If you're in any doubt about installation and extra software you might need, check <a href=\"http://www.calderasystems.com/\">www.calderasystems.com/</a> support/security/ for more detail. </p> <p>People who were hoping for a cheaper, faster processor from Intel have had their hopes dashed by the manufacturer's scrapping of its system on a chip, codenamed Timna. This was suffering from a glitch in the Memory Translator Hub (MTH) that would cause the entire system to freeze. </p> <p>Instead of launching and having to recall the product, which is what the company did with a million Pentium III motherboards earlier this year, the launch was initially delayed until early 2001. However, Intel has now conceded that rival systems may well overtake Timna in terms of speed by the time of the delayed release. The entire project has now been scrapped. </p> <p>At least one group of security consultants is so disillusioned with the number of bugs around in commonly-used systems that it has issued an ultimatum to software companies. </p> <p>CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) at Carnegie Mellon University has said it will allow software manufacturers 45 days to fix their systems and then go public with any information it has. It then hopes to publicise bugs alongside their solutions, in contrast with mailing lists like Bugtraq, which discusses unsolved bugs and security issues quite happily.</p>",

  "<p>The national lottery commission has been forced to grant Camelot an extension to its licence because it cannot meet the deadline for appointing the new lottery operator, it emerged today.</p> <p>The commission confirmed Camelot had been granted an interim licence to keep control of the game for a further two months to December 2001 , and it could be extended into 2002. </p> <p>Delays in deciding between the current operator, Camelot, and its rival, the People\u00d5s Lottery, have made it impossible to appoint a new operator by the licence expiry date next September.</p> <p>The decision follows a turbulent period for the commission in which the chairman, Dame Helena Shovelton, resigned after the high court overturned a commission decision to rule Camelot out of the running for the new licence.</p> <p>The commission said: \u00d2There have been a series of delays, all of which sprung from the failure of the bids.

  "I scare people. Not that this deters my readers - overwhelmingly female - from buying my books. They relish the fact that they are, if they're lucky, going to be sucked into the world of my imagination where very bad things happen to innocent victims. <p>There is no shortage of readers for books that chill to the marrow, stories that leave us afraid to turn the light out at two in the morning, tales that turn our dreams lurid. And yet this week's British Crime Survey reveals that women - by far the majority of crime fiction readers - are increasingly afraid of becoming victims of crime. In spite of the fact that the crime rate is falling and that in most instances men are more at risk, we women are much more scared than they are of what's out there. </p> <p>Why are we so fearful? What feeds our fears? And why, paradoxically, do we appear to seek out the very materials that feed our terrors? </p> <p>There is no simple answer, for fear is a complicated emotion. More than the automatic and entirely reasonable response to danger, fear is often an irrational escalation from a seed of reality, but it is no less real to the person experiencing it than a reaction that has a valid basis. </p> <p>The Home Office survey shows that women are far more afraid than men of certain kinds of crime: rape, physical attack, mugging, burglary, being pestered or insulted. The notion that they might be raped or sexually assaulted worries men far less than having their car broken into. </p> <p>The crimes women fear most are those that strike at the heart of who we think we are. At a recent conference in London, female crime writers spoke of their feeling that it would be impossible to have their central characters survive a rape and continue a series of novels without seismic shifts in style, tone and content. </p> <p>When I was a working journalist, I was the victim of an unprovoked attack at the hands of a well-known sportsman. He punched and kicked me. The physical damage he caused was no more than deep bruising, but the psychological damage was profound. It changed my view of who I was. I no longer felt safe doing a job I had previously known I was good at. I felt fear where before I had felt confidence. I didn't want revenge - I just wanted to hide away because at some level I couldn't escape the idea that, somehow, it had been my fault. </p> <p>Such beliefs are reinforced by authority all the time. Judges who indicate that rape victims were somehow asking for it because of the way they dressed or where they were; police officers who warn women not to go out alone when a rapist or a killer is on the loose, imposing a curfew on the victims rather than the perpetrators; people who criticise those women who endure domestic violence rather than walk away. </p> <p>All of this contributes to the insidious growth of fear. Culturally, in spite of the changes wrought by feminism, most women are still relatively powerless compared with men. And, whether consciously or subconsciously, it works to men's advantage to keep us scared. </p> <p>Women are more likely than men to experience harassment at work and on the street. Once you have been harassed, it's a lot easier to imagine how that could escalate into something worse. And, of course, once you have been on the receiving end of violence, you are much more likely to live in fear that it could happen again because you know what it does to you. Women who have experienced domestic violence consistently report higher levels of fear in public places. </p> <p>Sometimes, too, the response to violence against women seems wilfully lacking in sensitivity. The fear that if something does happen to you, it won't be taken seriously, also feeds into a general sense of apprehension and insecurity, and is the reason why so many women don't report minor or even major assaults. </p> <p>Of course, when a survey like this appears, there is always a scurrying around to find an acceptable scapegoat. One easy target is the dramatisation of crime that takes place in the media and the arts. This is not without some basis in truth. One academic study found that in Britain, readers of tabloid newspapers with more sensational crime coverage reported higher levels of fear than those who obtained their news from the broadsheets. Most women I know won't turn on programmes such as Crimewatch UK because they feel they are designed to jack up viewers' adrenaline levels and make us more afraid. </p> <p>Nevertheless, we still watch dramas like Without Reason, in which young women are abducted, abused and gruesomely murdered. We still devour serial killer thrillers in which women like us are regularly treated as disposable victims whose sole function in the novel is to be taken, tortured and terminated to satisfy the desires of yet another psychopath. </p> <p>I like to think that I write rather more thoughtfully than that; tot up the victims in my 15 novels and you will see I'm pretty much an equal opportunities murderer. But I admit that when I write about extreme violence, I intend my readers to flinch. It's important to me that my portrayal of the terrible things people do to each other - and, believe me, the real world is infinitely worse than anything I have ever invented - is rooted in a reality in which violence really does hurt. My characters do get scared. And usually for very good reason. </p> <p>So why am I - and my readers - colluding in the fear industry? I suppose one answer is that exposing ourselves to fictional material somehow reassures us. Whatever is happening, it's happening out there, to someone else. It's as if consuming this material has a totemic effect; it becomes a talisman to keep us safe. </p> <p>But perhaps it is more to do with the undeniable fact that certain kinds of fear are actually pleasurable. Adrenaline is, after all, a fabulous drug. It produces a great high, it's legal and it's free. We love roller coasters, the steeper and faster the better. We adore horror movies. Though few of us would care to admit it, most people at one time or another fantasise about terrible and scary things happening to us. </p> <p>Best of all, we know that if it's drama or fiction or our own fantasy, the outcome is under control. Order will be restored, reassurances offered. No human has been hurt in the making of this movie. However, it is an equally uncomfortable fact of life that being scared - especially if we can legitimise it to ourselves and others - is a very good tool for avoidance of responsibility and deflecting criticism. Whether or not we admit it, bringing out the protective element in others is a strategy that appeals to many of us. </p> <p>Women's fear does, it seems, have benefits for both men and women. While that remains true, it's not going to go away. </p> <p>\u0095 Val McDermid's latest novel is Killing the Shadows (HarperCollins).</p>",

  "Pressure on Gordon Brown to cut fuel duty for hauliers later this month will intensify today when the National Farmers' Union and the Freight Transport Association demand a 15p cut in diesel duty for the industry. They will also call for a small reduction in road tax for the general motorist. <p>However, the chancellor's room for manoeuvre in his pre-Budget report has been increased by growing divisions within the haulage lobby. </p> <p>The FTA is furious that the CBI and Society of Motor Manufacturers have pulled out of plans to be part of the submission. The idea of an industry-wide demand covering the four organisations had originally been tabled by the CBI's director general, Digby Jones. But big oil companies in the CBI opposed the move, believing that it would put undue pressure on the government. </p> <p>Lord MacDonald, the transport minister, will today meet the Fuel Forum, which brings together leaders of last month's petrol protest and the Road Haulage Association. The fuel protesters have threatened to try to paralyse the country again on November 13 unless their demands for a general cut in fuel duty are met. </p> <p>Tensions are high. David Handley, chairman of the \"people's fuel\" lobby, was arrested during a protest in a meat plant in Wales on Sunday night. </p> <p>Although Lord MacDonald will sound sympathetic at today's meeting, he has decided to rebut many of the claims of the haulage industry, pointing out that it is suffering 20% overcapacity, leading to tight profit margins. He will ask whether a solution would lie in imposing higher entry costs into the industry, and by clamping down on \"cowboy\" foreign operators. </p> <p>But in an eight page letter to the industry, he denies the widespread impression that hauliers are suffering historically high levels of bankruptices. He points out that there were only 1,131 bankruptcies last year against 1,775 in 1993. </p> <p>He does concede that fuel duty is lower on the continent, but says that is because mainland Europe pays higher income tax. </p> <p>Lord MacDonald also denies that foreign competition is beginning to make serious inroads into the British-owned haulage industry. He writes: \"Foreign vehicles continue to represent a very small proportion of overall freight traffic within the UK. Most foreign vehicles are engaged in international journeys, rather than performing cabotage (national transport carried out by foreign operators). </p> <p>\"The amount of cabotage undertaken in the UK by foreign hauliers represents just 0.06% of domestic transport.\" Germany, he says, suffers far more cabotage than Britain. </p> <p>He acknowledges that before travelling in Britain foreign-based hauliers can load up with 1,500 litres of diesel at far cheaper rates in Europe. But he says it would be illegal under EU law for the UK to apply a lower duty-free fuel limit to foreign lorries entering the country. </p> <p>In the letter, he warns the oil companies not to profiteer: \"It is regrettable that oil companies appear to be charging higher wholesale prices to some customers so soon after the fuel blockades have been lifted, and the director general of fair trading has written to the oil companies about this.\"</p>",

  "Yosef Mizrahi cannot tear himself away from the window of his daughter's flat. He trains his binoculars on the Palestinian village of Beit Jalla, which spills out from a hilltop across the way, moving upwards from the olive groves in the valley to the roofs of the nearest houses. <p>There is no sign of movement. But Mr Mizrahi remains restless. In the last 24 hours his daughter's flat at 329 Anafa Street in this Jewish settlement on the southern edges of Jerusalem has been turned into a frontline. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, when the Palestinian snipers on the opposite rooftops, a distance of perhaps 800 metres, opened fire, a bullet hit the thick outer wall of the flat, chipping off a block of golden stone close to the spot where Mr Mizrahi's daughter's wedding picture hangs in the bedroom. </p> <p>Yesterday, two tanks trundled back and forth at the foot of the building, where a bulldozer was ploughing a perimeter road. Soldiers were setting up a barricade of massive concrete blocks and Israel's new team of spin doctors was leading journalists on a conducted tour of the newest war zone in nearly three weeks of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. </p> <p>Mr Mizrahi, and his son-in-law, Roni Barazani, are singularly unimpressed by the spectacle unfolding beneath their first-floor window. \"This is just crap. What a waste of money,\" says Mr Barazani. \"It won't help at all. The bullets are coming from above.\" </p> <p>He cautions his guests, sitting on the black leatherette sofa in a front room crammed with toys: \"You know we are on army orders not to sit there. This is a frontline.\" </p> <p>When the firing started on Tuesday night, pockmarking a row of low-rise flats along the street, a border policeman was critically injured, taking a bullet in the chest. Two of Mr Barazani's neighbours were slightly injured. </p> <p>He, his wife, Ayelet, and two small daughters decamped to Mr Mizrahi's, who also lives in Gilo but far back from the ridge. Last night, the family was planning to drag mattresses into the small back bedroom shared by their daughters, one-year-old Yuval and Ofek, three. </p> <p>Several of their neighbours appear to have moved out until signs of a lasting calm. Police have set up a cordon at the entrance to the street in a half-hearted attempt to reduce traffic. Most curiosity seekers simply stroll down the end of the road and clamber down a flight of stairs to the flats. </p> <p>Of the bloodshed of the past weeks, both men claim a certain expertise. Mr Barazani is in the building trade and employs dozens of Palestinian labourers. When his family moved into their flat less than three years ago, a crew of Palestinian workers arrived to do the painting and plastering. </p> <p>\"They were all people from Beit Jalla. They sat and ate with us and we gave them money. There was no problem,\" says Mr Mizrahi. </p> <p>Born in Iraqi Kurdistan and a fluent Arabic speaker, Mr Mizrahi used to wander down to Beit Jalla twice a week to shop and to visit the holy sites of Bethlehem. He is particularly fond of Manger Square. </p> <p>\"With the Christians, we don't have a problem. It's a Muslim problem,\" Mr Mizrahi says. He stretches an arm towards Beit Jalla. \"Look how rich they are. What big houses they have, and every house there is for just one family.\" </p> <p>But this small flat is a millstone round the family's neck. Although they believe the tanks and barricades offer no real protection, Mr Barazani says he cannot even think of moving. \"Property prices have dropped 40 % overnight,\" he says. \"What am I supposed to do, put it up for sale with a tank thrown in for free? Who would buy it?\" </p> <p>He says his workers tell him they have no time for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. He argues they have benefited handsomely from Israel's national health scheme and other social benefits, and have no desire to give them up. </p> <p>\"We are not the people who started this,\" Mr Barazani says. \"They say they are just throwing stones and not firing with bullets. But stones can kill just as easily as a bullet.\" </p> <p>Still, both men believe war is inevitable, and that the latest ceasefire can do nothing to stop it. What is needed, they argue, is for Israel to stop tiptoeing around, and to hit the Palestinians back hard. </p> <p>\"If we want to, our soldiers could kill 1,000 of their people every day. We do not have a problem killing people, we have the power to do it. But instead, what is happening is that we have our soldiers risking their lives to avoid killing Arabs,\" Mr Mizrahi says.</p>",
  "Israeli commandos captured several men from the mob which lynched two of its soldiers, injecting a potentially combustible charge into the first tentative steps taken yesterday to curtail the violence in the Middle East and rebuild shattered confidence. <p>On a day of high tension and sporadic violence, Palestinian and Israeli sources reported that as many as eight men involved in last week's brutal slaying of two Israeli reservists at a police station in central Ramallah had been seized. </p> <p>The area where the men were murdered is under the full control of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, where Israeli forces are barred from operating alone. If it turns out the commandos had help from Palestinian police, that would make Mr Arafat appear to have sold out. </p> <p>Palestinian distrust could also rise following an appeal from the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, to the rightwing opposition Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, and other key players to join an emergency government. Many Palestinians would take that as a sign that Mr Barak has given up on the peace process. </p> <p>Yesterday he restated his belief that he could not make peace with Mr Arafat. \"To my sadness, I am not convinced that we have a partner for peace,\" he said. </p> <p>Less than a day after the US-brokered Sharm el-Sheikh summit gave the Oslo peace process the slenderest of second chances, military and security officials tried to defuse tensions. </p> <p>But new clashes were reported as Israel's Gen Yom Tov Samia and the Palestinian general Abdel-Razak al-Majaida met at the northern entrance to the Gaza Strip. Last night a powerful roadside bomb exploded as a civilian bus was passing an Israeli settlement. Earlier a Palestinian boy, 12, was seriously injured in one of many incidents. </p> <p>Israel welcomed a statement from Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority that it had \"issued strict orders to all Palestinians to follow through\" on the implementation of what was agreed at Tuesday's summit. </p> <p>The appeal was not issued in person byMr Arafat, who has faced angry protests about his presence at Sharm el-Sheikh. The call to halt the violence was aimed at Mr Arafat's Fatah faction, whose Tanzim gunmen have taken a lead in shooting attacks on Israeli positions, often from inside large crowds. More than 100 people, almost all Palestinians, have been killed in 21 days of fighting. </p> <p>In return, Israel announced the lifting of an internal closure on Palestinian areas, which prevented residents from travelling, and allowed the reopening of Gaza airport and border crossings to Egypt and Jordan. </p> <p>However, a general closure that prevents Palestinians from entering Israel remained in effect. </p> <p>Palestinian, Israeli and US security officials were meeting last night to decide when to start a 48-hour countdown after which a full ceasefire is due to come into effect. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Israel Radio said yesterday that one of the lynch suspects being held was the man who stood at the window of the police station with his bloodied hands raised in triumph. Nahman Shai, the Israeli government spokesman, refused to confirm the report.</p>",
  "With her younger daughter perched on her hip and the elder tugging at the knees of her jeans, Manal Kamel points her free arm towards the opposite hill and the tank whose machine gun is pointing at her home. <p>\"Just the sight of that tank is enough to panic us,\" she says. But the tank is there to stay. On Tuesday afternoon, about an hour after Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, agreed to end the violence, snipers perched on a neighbouring house opened up on the Jewish suburb of Gilo, a sprawl of low-rise apartment blocks 800 metres away. Israeli soldiers returned fire with machine guns. Yesterday, they enforced their positions around Gilo. </p> <p>Ms Kamel's home stands directly in their path. \"The bullets were falling like rain here. It was the most terrible thing. The children were taking their afternoon nap. It was very frightening.\" </p> <p>When the firing stopped, she took her children and fled to her mother's at the other end of Beit Jalla, a prosperous, mainly Christian village on the western fringes of Bethlehem. </p> <p>She felt no safer. \"Last night, I could not sleep because I kept thinking about my daughter. There is a big window in her room and the firing could start at any time.\" </p> <p>The Kamels came home yesterday morning, despite a warning from Israel's army for people living on Beit Jalla's firing line to evacuate their homes, or risk getting shot. But where else would Ms Kamel and her children go? </p> <p>Although the village is under Palestinian self-rule, the main road into Beit Jalla is blocked by an Israeli concrete guard post, and there is a strip of metal spikes on the road. The Israeli authorities have imposed closures on the West Bank and Gaza, barring Palestinians travelling to Israel proper. </p> <p>Ms Kamel is afraid that if she leaves her home, she may not be able to return for days. She and her husband, a candlemaker who supplies the churches of Beit Jalla and Bethlehem, have invested everything in this home. </p> <p>The family moved into the house nearly two years ago, a handsome two-storey building divided into four flats, one for each brother in an extended family. All enjoy spectacular views of a silvery-green olive grove, and the flats of Gilo. </p> <p>Nobody in the family has ever been to Gilo, built on illegally occupied Palestinian land which was later annexed to Jerusalem. There is a bridge spanning the valley, but it was built for cars speeding to other Jewish settlements to the south. Until the first of four recent gun battles between Beit Jalla and Gilo, it was as if their Jewish neighbours did not exist. </p> <p>Last night, the family was planning to bed down on mattresses on the floor of the back room. </p> <p>When the firing started on Tuesday, all seven children in the extended household were bundled downstairs to the basement in stages, the family huddling for intervals against the wall of the central stairwell. Ms Kamel's elder daugh ter, Juwana, an inquisitive girl in a tartan frock was old enough to understand what was happening, and she was terrified. \"She is four now and very sensitive. What can I explain to a little girl?\" she says. </p> <p>Shadia Bazazo, Ms Kamel's sister-in-law, has four older boys and her terrors are different. Across the valley from Bethlehem, they can hear the wake for Mohammed Jawarish, 14, who was shot dead by Israeli soldiers earlier in the week. \"We will keep struggling until we achieve victory,\" the mourners chant. \"We will take the same path as the martyrs.\" </p> <p>That is not the fate Ms Bazazo wants for her sons, aged 8 to 15. It takes all her strength to keep the older boys from wandering down to Bethlehem to join the other kids throwing stones at Israeli soldiers. With exams coming up, she wants them to stay indoors and study. But they cannot concentrate. </p> <p>This is not the life she wanted, she says. \"The governments of the world should do something. Stones cannot make anything.\" </p> <p>But she understands the powers driving the young men to court death at the hands of Israeli troops. \"A lot of them have had a brother or a son killed in the shooting. If I were them, I would go out and throw stones too.\" </p> <p>Not her sister-in-law who is furious both at the Israelis and at the snipers who have been taking up positions on the neighbour's roof, putting them in the crossfire. \"I blame all of them,\" Ms Kamel says. \"We are the victims, stuck here in between them.\"</p>",
  "An obsessed and lonely former beauty queen faces a long prison sentence for a plot to blackmail a former international footballer that persisted until a crown court jury found her guilty yesterday. <p>Carolyn Pick's initial hopes of sex and money became a deluded hunt for fame as she handed out pictures of herself during the trial and stared across the court at her victim, whose family life and reputation she had threatened to ruin in a series of chilling tapes. </p> <p>Foiled by rigorous legal restrictions from dragging his name into the headlines, the 36-year-old sat expressionless as the verdict was read after the jury had only been out for only 35 minutes. Judge David Hodson remanded her in custody, after warnings that she might still stalk the ex-footballer if given bail. </p> <p>Pick was taken from the dock with a warning that the sentence could be up to 14 years for a crime described during the seven-day hearing in Newcastle upon Tyne as sinister, menacing and relentless. Prosecuting counsel Robert Woodcock said that the six-year plot had harassed and frightened \"a very successful public figure, whose position and popularity make him vulnerable to exploitation\". </p> <p>The victim gave evidence at the trial, looking embarrassed as he described how cut-out photographs of naked men with his head glued on top had formed part of Pick's bombardment of letters, packages and calls. </p> <p>He described how friends and colleagues had been sent the material, while the would-be blackmailer taped a promise that she would prove his denials were lies. </p> <p>He told the jury: \"Some were suggestive and pleading. Others were very abusive, vitriolic and threatening. I was more than disturbed by it. You don't really know what you are dealing with.\" </p> <p>He was visibly angered when asked about claims that he had masturbated while on the phone to Pick when she first made contact. </p> <p>The court heard the man had put the phone down on Pick when she tricked him into ringing by leaving a message at his workplace claiming to be a colleague. The blackmailer, who is jobless and lives in a block of flats in Washington, Tyne and Wear, started talking about her suspenders and underwear, which her victim briefly took to be a friend playing a joke. </p> <p>The call was just long enough, the jury heard, for Pick to claim repeatedly that it amounted to phone sex and to make claims that she had been abused and only wanted an apology. </p> <p>Giving evidence, she broke down in tears as she said: \"I was bluffing. I want him to know I am very sorry. I just felt absolutely devastated and empty inside. I waited every night for him to call me, but he dumped me. He treated me like a chatline prostitute.\" </p> <p>The court was told Pick had made no specific demands for money or goods, but referred to her fondness for big houses, expensive cars, fine wine and beautiful restaurants, suggesting that her victim could use them to \"correct matters\". She was eventually cautioned by police when her calls took on a threatening tone. </p> <p>Pick, a former secretary, had a drab background that contrasted with the ex-footballer's apparent high life. Her work as a secretary was interrupted by one brief moment of glamour, when she was a finalist in the 1986 Miss England North East beauty competition. </p> <p>One of three sisters, she lost her father to cancer two years ago and has a mother who suffers from severe dementia. </p> <p>\"This is an unusual case of blackmail because what the defendant knew about the victim is little more than you or I know about him,\" said Mr Woodcock. </p> <p>Judge Hodson, who adjourned sentencing until November 17 while psychiatric reports are prepared, criticised media coverage of the trial. He asked prosecution barristers to put together a file of cuttings for the attorney general to assess whether there had been any breach of contempt of court orders protecting the victim's identity. </p> <p>The ex-footballer was not in court for the verdict and had no comment afterwards.</p>",
  "Police were last night still trying to identify one of the four men killed in the rail crash. <p>Relatives of the other three had been informed that their loved ones died in the disaster, but officers were struggling to establish who the fourth man was. </p> <p>Postmortems were carried out on two of the victims yesterday afternoon and police were hoping that inquests on all four, whose bodies were being held at the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Welwyn Garden City, could be opened tomorrow. </p> <p>All but three of those who needed hospital treatment were released and able to complete their journeys which began yesterday afternoon or returned home. </p> <p>Seven - six of them women - had been kept in overnight. Those who remained in hospital were a 41-year-old man from south-east London, a 30-year-old woman from Wakefield, and a 66-year-old woman from Harrogate. Among the injuries to the seven were a punctured lung, a broken leg and fractured vertebrae. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the police investigation centred on a 600 metre stretch of track strewn with debris and mangled metal. </p> <p>At 3pm yesterday, the carriages which had fallen on to their sides were lifted high enough so that officers could make sure that no one else had been trapped underneath. </p> <p>Otherwise police were concentrating on a fingertip search of the area. The stretch of track was divided into sections and teams on hands and knees picked their way through the wreckage. </p> <p>Whenever they found an object which they believed could be of interest or which they could not identify they called over awaiting technical experts to check what the object was. The whole operation was filmed and could be used in evidence as part of any criminal prosecution. </p> <p>By 5pm the police had checked one fifth of the area and confirmed that they had not found any evidence so far that vandalism might have caused the crash. </p> <p>Among police officers at the scene were scenes of crime expert and members of the Metropolitan police's body recovery team. Sixty or 70 people were present at any one time. </p> <p>Inspector Alec Carson, of British Transport Police, said the search could take several days, possibly even a week. If the weather worsened - yesterday it remained mostly dry - it could take even longer. Those who saw the train wreck at close hand said it was a bizarre sight. One of the rails looked like a rope which had been flicked up over the other track. </p> <p>Police officers found themselves picking through suitcases, handbags and briefcases which had been thrown across the track. The buffet car was a mess of broken glass and jagged metal. The roof looked, in one observer's words, like \"a piece of material flapping about.\" </p> <p>Tin cans and bags were scattered inside. </p> <p>The blackberry bushes along the side of the track were pockmarked with bits of metal and rubbish. </p> <p>The gantry which supported the electric cables had collapsed on to the track. The atmosphere was described as \"eerily quiet, sombre\". </p> <p>The scene clearly disturbed even senior officers and railwaymen. </p> <p>Chris Garnett, chief executive of GNER, said it had been horrific to see the ripped up track, the coaches on their sides and the huge wheels scattered across the rails. </p> <p>But assistant chief constable Paul Nicholas, of British Transport Police, said that his 35 years service had taught him that rail travel remained the safest form of transport. </p> <p>He said: \"There is no doubt the railways are still the safest way to travel. Millions of people travel safely every day.\"</p>",
  "Tony Benn's plan to reform the way of choosing the Speaker of the Commons yesterday won the backing of the Conservative front runner, Sir George Young. <p>But important members of Labour's establishment discreetly threw their weight behind the \"Buggin's turn\" principle of having a Tory as successor to Betty Boothroyd, formerly a Labour MP. </p> <p>Despite the government's determined effort to stay out of a contest among backbench MPs, the leader of the Commons, Margaret Beckett, let it be known she favoured a Tory - provided the Opposition could field \"a heavyweight candidate\" who was also a reformer. Sir George fits that bill, being a poll tax rebel sacked by Lady Thatcher who became John Major's transport secretary. </p> <p>But the Labour frontrunner, Michael Martin, the Glaswegian former shop steward, now one of Betty Boothroyd's deputies, has amassed considerable support, and remains the bookies' favourite. </p> <p>Mrs Beckett's aides were careful yesterday to say that she was not endorsing Sir George or undermining Mr Martin, both self-declared reformers. But the net effect of her advice was to do just that, five days ahead of Monday's Commons vote to succeed Miss Boothroyd. </p> <p>Other senior Labour fixers were also delicately urging backbench colleagues to consider that Labour might be vulnerable to renewed charges of \"control freakery\" if it insisted on two Labour speakers in a row - a breach with a 30-year tradition. </p> <p>Sir George yesterday wrote to Mr Benn endorsing his plan for replacing the rolling vote between two candidates at a time, with a straight ballot between all contenders and a run-off between the top two. </p> <p>But Mr Benn's meeting to press his case on Sir Edward Heath, Father of the Commons who will chair Monday's election, was postponed.</p>",
  "The government is to introduce sweeping new laws cracking down on workplace discrimination on the grounds of religion, sexual orientation, age and disability. <p>It will be the first legislation in Britain outlawing discrimination on the grounds of religion and sexual orientation, and follows a landmark European Union directive rubber stamped by the European Council of ministers yesterday. </p> <p>The government must put in place a system of \"proportionate and persuasive\" legal sanctions to discourage discrimination which is likely to include financial compensation and mandatory reinstatement. </p> <p>The new anti-discrimination package will apply across all EU countries and was agreed after the government secured a series of opt outs. </p> <p>The outlawing of discrimination on the grounds of religion or sexual orientation must be in place by 2003, with provisions covering discrimination on age and disability following three years later. </p> <p>The home secretary Jack Straw had resisted calls from religious leaders for religious discrimination to be outlawed, but had commissioned more research into the issue. Muslims in particular felt that the scale of Islamaphobia they faced warranted legislation. </p> <p>Francis Maude MP, the shadow foreign secretary, attacked the government's decision to sign up to the directive: \"We believe it is right to strive for the elimination of discrimination in general, but we warned about the problems of this directive months ago.\" </p> <p>Claude Moraes MEP, Labour's European parliament spokesman for employment and social affairs, said: \"The government had taken the view that it's not desirable to extend the law to cover religious discrimination. Now the EU has done it. </p> <p>Angela Mason, director of the gay rights group Stonewall, said: \"It's very good news. At the moment in this country there is no legislation protecting gay men or lesbians in the workplace.\" </p> <p>Afraid that the new legislation would spark a costly wave of litigation from workers, the government refused to endorse the directive until it had secured a number of key opt-outs. </p> <p>\"This is exactly the sort of directive that could give rise to a plethora of challenges and legal uncertainty for years to come,\" warned one UK official before the talks ended in Luxembourg on Tuesday night. </p> <p>The government was particularly worried that the armed forces would be forced to recruit people who simply were not \"combat ready\" and won an exemption that will allow the army to continue to turn down and sack people who are too old or disabled to serve. </p> <p>Religious schools will be able to continue to recruit staff of the same faith without risking challenge, according to employment minister Tessa Jowell. The business community also has doubts about the directive's section on age discrimination and condemned it as a \"fuzzy law\" which will trigger more employment tribunal applications. </p> <p>John Cridland, deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry said: \"Will a company be able to enforce a contractual agreement to retire? Can a firm offer higher pay to older staff?\" </p> <p>But with a growing number of people taking early retirement and claiming state pensions many European governments are keen to encourage employers not to automatically get rid of older workers. </p> <p>The European Commission, the architect of the directive, says this legislation shows the EU is not just about economics. \"This sends a strong signal that the EU is also a community of values,\" said Anna Diamantopoulou, commissioner for employment and social affairs.</p>",
  "<p>Their nickname is the vultures - hedge funds which swoop on struggling economies in the developing world, buying up their debts at a discount then suing the governments for the full face value. </p> <p>One New York based fund, Elliott Associates, has made more than $130m (\u00a393m) out of the practice over the past year, according to Jubilee 2000, the lobby group campaigning for the cancellation of unpayable third-world debt. </p> <p>After winning a landmark judgment against the Peruvian government in the New York courts in October last year, Elliott finally forced Peru to pay it $65m this month, by threatening to seize money which the Lima government had transferred to Wall Street banks to pay other bondholders. The company had bought up the Peruvian debt for $20m. </p> <p>\"It may be business to them but these people are trading in misery,\" says Liana Cisneros, Latin American coordinator for Jubilee 2000. \"To the children of Peru it is schoolbooks, medicines and clean water.\" Half of Peru's population live in extreme poverty, and debt payments to western creditors consume almost a third of the government's budget, outstripping spending on either health or education. </p> <p>The case has raised alarm bells in capitals throughout Latin America. The vultures travel in flocks, and are already lining up their next victim. </p> <p>Ecuador, which has almost completed a deal with its creditors in the aftermath of its debt default a year ago, has already been stung. As long as the creditors were threatening legal action, a negotiated settlement was impossible, and Quito was forced to pay off the vultures, before it could sort out the rest of its debts. </p> <p>The funds, of course, do not see themselves as parasites, but rather as champions of creditors at a time when, they argue, sovereign debtors are being allowed to walk away too lightly from their legal obligations. </p> <p>When a defaulting country renegotiates its outstanding debts, creditors typically lose out badly, accepting much less than the face value of the loans. In the case of Ecuador, creditors accepted just 40 cents for every dollar they were owed. </p> <p><strong> Squeezing the debtor</strong><br> </p> <p> Except, that is, the vultures who got in first and got a much better deal. But while the funds are raking in the money, concern is growing that the actions of a few rogue creditors are threatening attempts to get bankrupt economies back on the road to financial health. </p> <p>The US treasury has warned that the funds risk creating \"economic chaos\" in foreign lands. </p> <p>Other creditors are not happy either. They say the vultures are pushing their way to the head of the queue, squeezing the maximum out of debtor nations, and leaving less for other investors. Under New York law, a creditor with a tiny proportion of a country's outstanding debt can block a settlement which would be in the interest of the majority of creditors. </p> <p>The solution, according to international finance experts, is for borrowing countries to include a clause in bond contracts requiring bond holders to agree a settlement by majority vote, rather than allowing one creditor to grab as much as possible through the courts. Such arrangements, known as collective action clauses (CACs ), are already standard in bonds issued in London, but the New York financial community is resistant . </p> <p>The Wall Street big hitters argue that CACs will increase the cost of borrowing for poor countries because the markets suspect that any country including one is worried about defaulting. Like a pre-nuptial agreement which rather suggests that marriage partners do not trust one another, they say CACs increase perceptions that a country is not creditworthy. </p> <p>Richard Portes, the head of the London Centre for Economic Policy Research, says comparing borrowing costs for emerging countries in London with New York shows that the claim that CACs increase borrowing costs is untrue. \"Except for countries which are at the bad end of the credit ratings and shouldn't be borrowing commercially anyway, CACs result in an improvement in terms,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It's the same reason that we have bankruptcy laws; you want to have a rules-based procedure to sort things out.\" Otherwise, he says, countries can end up tied in legal knots by some creditors, as Peru was, to the detriment of others. Making CACs mandatory in bond contracts would avoid the problem. </p> <p>The main players in the international financial system are sympathetic to the case for CACs and most of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations have backed them. But the US, the most important player because it regulates Wall Street, is dragging its feet. </p> <p>For Jubilee 2000 however, collective action clauses do not go far enough. CACs are fairer for creditors but do not take into account the economic hardship that paying back debts is imposing on many desperately poor countries. </p> <p>\"The lawlessness of the international financial system gives all creditors enormous power over sovereign debtors,\" says Ann Pettifor, director of Jubilee 2000. </p> <p>\"We urgently need an independent international insolvency process which takes into account the true cost of repaying debt, and holds creditors as well debts, responsible for the debt crisis.\" </p> <p>Useful links:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jubilee2000uk.org/main.html\" target=\"_new\">Jubilee 2000</a></p>",
  "A grammar school which banned a pupil from foreign school trips because he is diabetic is facing an unprecedented legal challenge over its decision, it emerged last night. <p>Tom White, 15, was told he could not travel to France on the watersports holiday with fellow pupils from Clitheroe Royal grammar school in Lancashire even though he had been allocated a place and paid a deposit. </p> <p>The decision came after he had his first severe hypoglycaemic attack - caused by a drop in blood-sugar levels - on a skiing trip last February. </p> <p>The school told his parents, Malcolm, 48, and Rosemary, 42, a lecturer of music, that Tom was also unable to take part in a German exchange visit, although he is studying for a GCSE in the language. </p> <p>The Disability Rights Commission is pursuing legal action against the school in the first case of its kind under the goods and services section of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. </p> <p>DRC chairman Bert Massie said: \"It is blatantly unfair to ban Tom because he has had one severe hypo. There is no justification for this. A disabled pupil should have access to the same opportunities as everyone else. </p> <p>\"It highlights the urgency to put the education system squarely within the bounds of anti-discrimination law.\" </p> <p>Mr White said his son, who developed diabetes when he was nine, was devastated by the ban. </p> <p>\"It is totally unfair to stop him from going on trips with his friends and other pupils just because he has diabetes.\" </p> <p>\"Tom has never had a day off sick because of the diabetes. He is fit and even played for the school football team. </p> <p>\"There are normally warning signs before a hypo, but because he was in bed at the time he did not recognise the symptoms of drowsiness. He has not blacked out since.\" </p> <p>The boy's doctors also confirmed he had good control over his condition, which affects 1.4m people in Britain. He takes two injections of insulin a day, which enables him to lead a normal life. </p> <p>His father said he had first thought the problem with the school was ignorance of the illness: \"We thought that as soon as they heard from an expert, that would be the end of the matter, but they wouldn't talk to the expert. It's an arrogance and conceit which is beyond anything that I have ever come across. They are totally defiant that they will not lose.\" </p> <p>Stuart Holt, headmaster of the 1,120-pupil school and sixth form, said he believed it would be unfair on Tom to comment at this point as the case was very sensitive. </p> <p>But in a letter to Mr and Mrs White he expressed support to teachers who were unwilling or felt unable to take the additional responsibility of looking after the boy. </p> <p>The letter said: \"The teachers who organised the trip were fully acquainted with his condition and knew the steps to take. They took those steps with great skill, great determination and great difficulty. They had difficulty in opening his mouth since his jaw had locked when he passed out. </p> <p>\"In view of this incident I am unwilling for Thomas to join any extra-curricular visits where the organising teacher is unwilling or unable to take this responsibility.\"</p>",
  "Geoffrey Robinson, the wealthy former minister, is now criticised by some for saying too much in his memoirs, by others for saying too little. Even those who have good reason to be relieved taunt him for failing to produce a smoking gun or fire a silver bullet. <p>In fact, Robinson, correctly dubbed an unconventional minister by Tony Blair, has the ability to unleash the political equivalent of an artillery barrage but never intended to pull the trigger. </p> <p>I can claim a little responsibility (or if you prefer, part of the blame) for the book, after suggesting to Robinson in the spring of last year that he should write an autobiography and I, then political editor of the Mirror, would help him. Unbeknown to me, Robinson, forced to resign four months earlier over that \u00a3373,000 loan, had thought of doing a book while still in government, so within a fortnight we were off. </p> <p>From the outset Robinson declared he would concentrate on policy and Labour's achievements, though he accepted that his financial relations with Peter Mandelson, Joska Bourgeois and Robert Maxwell - a prominent trio during his controversial spell in office - had to feature. And then there was the question of the millionaire's wider business dealings and funding of the offices of Blair and Gordon Brown which needed to be tackled. </p> <p>I helped draw up a synopsis and publication was scheduled for the late autumn of 1999. Sitting at his desk in the eighth-floor corner apartment in London's Grosvenor Park Hotel, he would write down his recollections on sheets of A4 paper before asking Colin, his driver, to have them typed up by a former secretary, Margaret Sims, in an office on Coleshill industrial estate just outside Coventry. </p> <p>Back down to London would come typed copies and a computer disc so, after interviewing him at length about the chapter, I could revise. The words would be batted between us until he was happy with what was to be the final version. </p> <p>Two things became clear early on, both of them frustrating for a journalist. The first was Robinson's desire to concentrate on policy, the second his stubbornness over the timetable and reluctance to hit the deadline. He was distracted by a DTI inquiry into his business dealings and was under enormous pressure from Gordon Brown not to go into print. Brown, a close friend, repeatedly urged Robinson to abandon a project that would inevitably reignite the party's feuds. </p> <p> Around the end of July last year, with less than half the pages completed, I wrote my last word (declining any fee) ahead of moving to the Guardian and writing my own book with Nick Cohen, the Observer columnist. Robinson vowed he would finish; I wrongly disbelieved him. Later I learned that Anji Hunter, an aide at No 10, had - despite denials - been dispatched by Downing Street to stop him. Robinson's stubbornness saw him ploughing on to his own timetable and the book Downing Street mocked and dreaded in equal measure was finally completed last summer. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson suggested this week that Robinson had been manipulated, while one report even claimed that Gordon Brown's former spin doctor, Charlie Whelan, ghost-wrote the memoirs. Both claims are untrue. The Unconventional Minister is very much Robinson's book, which is precisely why he, at root a party loyalist, does not go for the jugular. Whelan wrote not a single word and the sections I was involved with more than a year ago have been extensively reworked. </p> <p>Out is much entertaining \"colour\" Robinson always detested - such as the Dover sole, fresh fruit salad and Puligny Montrachet 1986 wheeled up by room service for that fateful Mandelson dinner \u00e0 deux on May 23 1996. Gone are the slightly more uncomfortable details for Mandelson of house hunting in happier times and how an offer starting at about \u00a3100,000 spiralled to \u00a3373,000. Missing are the handwritten letters about buying the property, that the Northern Ireland secretary must surely regret sending. </p> <p>The tone, however, does come across as more hostile to Mandelson, if the Daily Mail's serialisation reflects the actual text, which in turn may reflect Robinson's growing perception as the borrower attempted to shift responsibility on the lender. </p> <p>Fevered speculation ahead of publication reached preposterous proportions with unfounded Sunday newspaper tales that it could contain compromising photographs of Mandelson. More interesting was speculation over how much Robinson donated to the party and whether he poured cash into Blair's \"blind fund\" to finance his office. </p> <p>Robinson can appear disorganised in public, but his private records, including voluminous correspondence and details of financial transactions, are thought to be more ordered. From the start he maintained that no figures would appear, despite reports to the contrary, therefore allowing the speculation to run out of control and William Hague to shout sleaze. </p> <p>Robinson funded Brown's office in opposition and commissioned expensive research on the windfall tax. He also financed Blair's office (the sum is thought to be below the \u00a3250,000 plucked out of the air and now cited as fact) via the Labour party rather than Blair's blind trust. The denials of trustees were accurate, but amid the confusion of recent days at least one character may best be advised to pause before denying support for Blair's office was ever solicited. </p> <p>Robinson has always been a controversial politician and his memoirs make him more so despite a loyalty to Brown, respect for Blair and his position as a Labour MP requiring him to pull his punches, even if some of those who feature still feel badly bruised. Peter Mandelson is the prime victim, as Robinson declares he has nothing but goodwill for him, while Brown, who failed to halt the book, would not be human if he failed to take some pleasure from its publication. </p> <p>Is Robinson bitter? He insists not, though No 10 is unconvinced. Is Mandelson, as he believes, the victim of a fiendish Brownite plot to destroy him? Certainly Robinson is no friend, but he could have been more of an enemy. </p> <p>The Unconventional Minister, as with all memoirs, is partial and we must await more books, hopefully including one from Mandelson, before we have the full picture. As cabinet secretary Sir Richard Wilson put it, during a Whitehall mission to sack Robinson: \"Rough old game, politics.\" </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:kevin.maguire@theguardian.com\">kevin.maguire@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The 12.10 from London to Leeds passed the train on which I was travelling 10 minutes before it crashed. I think I recollect it, a flickering distraction from the papers I was reading on my way into King's Cross. I still haven't quite grasped the idea that while I was packing my bag and thinking about my lunch, the other train was being ripped apart. <p>It's hardly surprising that we should wish to find the person responsible for this outrage and vent our fury upon him. It's no less surprising that the man who runs the company charged with maintaining the track should be identified as the culprit. But to blame Gerald Corbett would be to exonerate the real offenders. He has presented himself as a sacrifice, to atone for the multiple failures of our railways. We should reject it. </p> <p>If the crash was caused by a broken rail, then there can be little doubt that Railtrack is partly responsible. Two months ago the regulator informed the company that its failure to reduce the number of breakages appreciably was a breach of its licence. The health and safety executive had warned that \"the risk of derailment from a broken rail is likely to remain significant for some time to come.\" </p> <p>But whatever the immediate reasons for the crash might have been, the underlying causes predate Mr Corbett's appointment by decades. The Beeching cuts brought to an end not only a widely accessible railway system, but also a management ethic which, for a few years at least, placed public wellbeing ahead of competing private interests. The haste with which the railway lands were sold and the decision to dynamite some of the bridges - ensuring that the cuts could not be reversed - suggest that a reduction in public spending was not the government's only consideration. </p> <p>Years later, the Tories' motives for running down the railways also appeared to be mixed. When Mrs Thatcher announced that \"nothing can stop the great car economy\", she meant it. Just as the traffic light intervals on the old Winchester road were increased in order to make the case for a bypass through Twyford Down more compelling, just as the ferries to the Isle of Skye were allowed to fall apart in order to generate public pressure for a privately financed bridge, so Britain's railways were left to deteriorate to make their eventual privatisation seem more attractive. </p> <p>As the network fell apart, so our faith in public provision waned, and our participation in the great car economy - socially fragmented, non-unionised and lucratively unsustainable as it was - increased. By the time privatisation was mooted, our suspicion of the government's proposals was matched only by our loathing of British Rail. </p> <p> Fragmentation of the privatised network by the Conservatives, with its accompanying diffusion of responsibility for safety, makes sense only as a strategy for impeding renationalisation. By insisting that regulation should be as light as possible, by withdrawing subsidies from the railways and pouring them into roads, they exposed British people to the dangers both of a dysfunctional rail network and of the far more hazardous cars in which we were forced to travel. </p> <p>Privatising the railways both diffused and confused responsibility. Gerald Corbett's fiduciary duty forced him to place the interests of his shareholders ahead of those of his passengers. While directors of companies can be imprisoned for failing to discharge their responsibility to keep the share price as high as possible, the Home Office's new corporate manslaughter proposals would submit them to no more drastic penalty than disqualification for killing their customers. Money, in company law, is better protected than human life. </p> <p>The current government seems to understand why our railways are failing, so why are its proposed solutions so timid? Soon after taking office, John Prescott rejected the idea of renationalisation, on the grounds that it would cost some \u00a34bn. Yet now he proposes to pour \u00a360bn into the privatised railways, while reclaiming only a limited amount of regulatory control. It is hard to see why the new public investment should not be reclassified as equity, endowing the government with a controlling financial stake in the network. It is still harder to see why it wants to do to air traffic control and the London Underground what the Tories did to the railways. </p> <p>By loading the problems of our railways on to the shoulders of one man, we relieve the government of its responsibility to reclaim real public control over the way they are run. The people on the train that passed mine deserve solutions, not scapegoats. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "So is privatisation compatible with rail safety? Despite Tuesday's tragedy death is still, mercifully, a rare event on the railways. Some 10 people are killed each and every day on Britain's roads. Rail remains a safer way to travel. <p>Also, there is no clear trend in deaths since privatisation. The deaths at Ladbroke Grove, north London, a year ago upped the number of rail deaths in 1999-2000 to the highest figure for a decade. But similar tragedies happened in the days of British Rail. The Clapham rail crash in 1988 resulted in 35 deaths. The chart shows accidents: some increase but not much since Railtrack was sold off in 1996. </p> <p>Profit is not necessarily incompatible with putting safety first. As Railtrack found this week, there is nothing worse for shareholder value than putting customers' lives at risk. Gerald Corbett's offer to resign shows accidents are not exactly in the interests of rail executives, leaving aside questions of personal liability and corporate manslaughter. Other privatised companies such as BAA, which operates air traffic control around its airports, and British Airways, have good safety records. </p> <p>Lines of accountability are more to the point. Privatisation has resulted in a complex structure. British Rail was vertically integrated. Railtrack owns the track and 25 separate companies operate the trains. Railtrack is regulated by the Office of the Rail Regulator (ORR). The train companies operate under franchises awarded by the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority (SSRA). Relationships between the parties are governed by complex legal agreements. Overall responsibility for regulating railway safety rests with the health and safety commission and its operational arm, the health and safety executive (HSE). </p> <p>New Labour decided to work with the grain of privatisation rather than to reverse it. It sought to give strategic direction to the railways with the creation of the SSRA, chaired by Sir Alistair Morton - it will cease to be a shadow and gain new powers later this year, when the transport bill becomes law. At the ORR a new regulator, Tom Winsor, is up and running. As a result of Ladbroke Grove, Railtrack has been required to set up a new non-profit-making company, Railway Safety. Its role is to carry out independent safety assessments and safety audits. </p> <p>Investment is also important. Railways were starved during the process of privatisation. Since then, investment has increased and the government's 10-year transport plan in July announced a major boost. It commits a total of \u00a360bn to the railways over the next 10 years, nearly half of it from taxpayers. There is still a catch-up job to return the network to the state of repair before privatisation began. </p> <p>An inquiry by the national audit office published earlier this year concluded that the ORR has found difficulty in establishing how far Railtrack has discharged its obligations to maintain and renew the network. Within a few days the rail regulator is supposed to publish his periodic review which will set the level of charges that Railtrack makes on passenger and freight operators. So on it depends the level of investment that Railtrack will be able to sustain. </p> <p>But cold calculation will not be enough to satisfy the public. John Prescott promised whatever investment it takes to make the railways safe. Automatic Train Protection (ATP), the more expensive system that ensures that even high-speed trains cannot pass red signals without stopping, has so far been rejected on a cost-benefit analysis that says it is too expensive for the number of lives it would save. </p> <p>This position is almost certainly unsustainable and if, as likely, ATP is installed, public funding would surely follow. </p> <p>Hatfield may have consequences for its plans for the National Air Traffic Services (Nats) and London Underground. The \"public-private partnership\" for air traffic may now be a privatisation too far, more trouble than the \u00a3350m it might bring in. It is not too late for the government to choose a public sector or non-profit company alternative. Nothing in the transport bill precludes this. </p> <p>The Industrial Society's inquiry into paying for the Tube highlighted the HSE's concerns about safety. The partnership arrangement favoured by John Prescott faces the same pitfalls as rail privatisation, dividing the infrastructure between private companies with a public entity operating the trains. Making the case after Hatfield is going to be more difficult even if the question of ownership remains secondary to those about investment and safety standards. </p> <p>Tony Grayling is a transport specialist at the Institute for Public Policy Research. <br><a href=\"mailto:t.grayling@ippr.org.uk\">t.grayling@ippr.org.uk</a></p>",
  "Plans by one of Spain's best known politicians to publish a blacklist of men who abuse their partners have pitted the country's centre-right government, which sees the proposal as a violation of civil liberties, against women's groups who consider it a breakthrough in their fledgling struggle against domestic violence. <p>The proposal is from the regional president of southern Castille, Jos\u00e9 Bono, a veteran socialist, who says the move will deter offenders and end \"the hypocrisy of those who appear to lead blameless lives while causing abject terror behind closed doors\". </p> <p>But a government spokesman, Pio Cabanillas, denounced it as \"shameless populism and vigilante tactics\". </p> <p>The interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, said: \"It is false to present this as a miraculous solution or a magic cure. There are none in this area.\" </p> <p>The row has served to air the issue of abuse inside the home which has only recently come to light in Spain. Traditionally women suffer in silence with virtually no form of redress. </p> <p>Domestic violence has only been punishable by law since the late 1970s and many die as a result of it - 51 so far this year. </p> <p>\"This could be a very positive initiative that gives many women the courage they need to come forward,\" said a spokeswoman for the Federation of Divorced and Separated Women. </p> <p>\"It is very worrying that so many people should appear so concerned about the identity of abusers being publicised,\" said Cristina Almeida, a feminist lawyer and socialist politician. </p> <p>Mr Bono says he will press ahead, regardless of the row, taking advantage of the leeway provided by Spain's largely devolved system of government. \"If the list saves just one woman it will be worth it,\" he said. </p> <p>But Pilar Davila, who runs the government institute responsible for women, said: \"Printing such a list would almost certainly be illegal and unconstitutional. There are far more effective ways of dealing with this problem.\"</p>",
  "Al Gore finally did what he needed to do in the last of the three American presidential debates with George W Bush on Tuesday. He scored a win. <p>It was only a narrow win, with Mr Bush once again putting in an above-expectations performance. But the battle, if not the war, clearly went to Mr Gore, setting up a neck-and-neck contest for the White House in the last three weeks before the election. </p> <p>Tuesday's debate, in front of a studio audience of undecided voters in St Louis, was much more combative than the candidates' first two meetings. Both seemed to feel freer than before to highlight major contrasts between their policies, philosophies and personalities. As a result, America now faces not just a closely fought contest, but a contest between two sharply polarised approaches to government. </p> <p>After being criticised for being too aggressive in the first debate, and too passive in the second, Mr Gore dug back into the populist themes and rhetoric which helped him build a lead over Mr Bush following the August convention season. The lead was subsequently clawed back by Mr Bush. </p> <p>At the heart of Mr Gore's pitch was the claim that he would continue the eight Clinton-Gore years of economic prosperity, while his Republican opponent would squander it with tax cuts for the wealthy. Mr Gore's advisers said that they intend to make this the defining issue of the final phase of the campaign. </p> <p>Mr Bush also took his stand on tried-and-tested messages of his own, calling Mr Gore a big spender and a big government man whose time had passed. </p> <p>At times, each man seemed to be speaking more to the converted than to the undecideds. This underlines the fact that, in an election where turnout is unlikely to exceed 50%, the candidates are now mainly focused on mobilising their core supporters through television advertising in battleground states. </p> <p>Instant polls among debate watchers confirmed the view among commentators that Mr Gore had bested Mr Bush. A CBS survey gave Mr Gore a five-point lead on the night, while a CNN instant poll gave him a two-point advantage. </p> <p>The tightness of the contest for the White House was un derlined by four new polls in swing states. In all four - in Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington - Mr Gore had only a one or a two-point lead over Mr Bush. A top Gore adviser said yesterday that the vice-president will now concentrate his efforts in Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan, where he arrived last night. </p> <p>\"I will fight for you,\" Mr Gore told debate viewers more than once, painting himself as the candidate who could be trusted to deliver on education and health reform, and to safeguard retirement benefits for \"hard working families\". </p> <p>Mr Bush, he claimed, was the candidate of big business, who would squander American economic strength by giving large tax cuts to the richest. </p> <p>In a moment that will doubtless be replayed many times in Gore campaign ads, the vice-president challenged Mr Bush to deny that his plan for tax cuts favours the wealthiest 1% of Americans. \"Of course it does,\" Mr Bush responded. \"If you pay the taxes, why shouldn't you get the benefit.\" </p> <p>In return, Mr Bush pointed to his Democrat opponent, saying: \"This is a big spender.\" He accused Mr Gore of \"proposing the largest increase in federal spending in years\", and depicted himself as a fresh outsider untainted by Washington politics. </p> <p>\"I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>One of the earliest clashes of the evening was also one of the most emblematic, with Mr Gore saying there was \"strong disagreement\" between the two men on health care insur ance and forcing Mr Bush on to the defensive about his record on the issue in Texas. </p> <p>Under pressure, Mr Bush claimed he had \"pushed through\" a patients' bill of rights as Texas governor. In fact, Mr Bush first vetoed and then refused to sign legislation giving patients the right to sue their health insurance organisations - a distortion which Mr Gore called \"unacceptable\". </p> <p>\"Here we go again,\" Mr Gore said after Bush had pledged action against the high cost of prescription drugs for the elderly. \"If you want someone who will spin a lot of words ... and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.\"</p>",
  "<p>I wouldn't use any of these barristers myself. Admittedly they always appear for the defence, but they didn't win a single case in the first episode of <strong> North Square </strong> (Channel 4). Neither the man who stole Y-fronts from washing lines, nor the pathetic, pregnant shoplifter, nor the quite-nice-really murderer. And God knows what happened to the schizophrenic they abandoned to her fate in Liverpool when they all decamped to Leeds to have a baby. Still, plenty of people you'd cross the road at a run to avoid make excellent viewing. And so do these. </p> <p>North Square by Peter Moffat is a 10-part drama series full of energy and edge, which can look any similar American effort in the eye. </p> <p>These barristers are young, good-looking, clever, ruthless. They don't exactly enter. The doors burst open and they blow in. \"What's the jury like?\" \"Four Daily Telegraphs, three moustaches, one blazer, two blue rinses and a Mormon in the front row.\" \"It's not a jury at all, Alex, it's a coffee morning.\" \"A jury of Rich Tea dunkers.\" \"Bloody bastard custard cream lickers.\" \"Steady, Billy.\" You will - for you are quick like that - have deduced that these are Alex and Billy, that they are about to go down in flames like fighter pilots, that Billy is the more incendiary of the two (he has a bet on the outcome of the case) and that the jury is one short. </p> <p>It's a strenuous series, and you have to run to keep up, but there are cases to suit all tastes. </p> <p>The vagaries of the clerk (a role just munched alive by Phil Davis) mean that innocent Morag, fresh from Mull, finds herself defending a murderer in Portia-like rhythms (\"Bail is an entitlement. You don't give it. You have to take it away\"), while the experienced Billy has to try to defend a man with a moral compulsion to wipe out Y-fronts (\"My client wants to tell you very sincerely that he is not sorry for what he has done.\") </p> <p>The murderer and the sworn foe of Y-fronts have the look of men who have collided with life face-first. They are sharing the same police cell with, for the moment, Billy, who is taking his client's instructions. \"It's not just underpants. It's Y-fronts. I think they are repugnant, oppressive and a violence to the eye. I consider it my duty to remove them.\" \"What, Mr Burns, given these circumstances, do you think your defence might be?\" \"It was very well put at Nuremberg. There are certain laws which it is the moral duty of every citizen to break. I'm sure you will agree, Mr Guthrie, that morality and law are not the same thing.\" \"Some people like Y- fronts. It's their entitlement\", objected Billy. \"Keats is not better than Bob Dylan\", said Burns obscurely. </p> <p>At this point the murderer, Frank \"Mad Bastard\" Green, justified his name by thrusting a face like a clenched fist at them and shouting \"Fucking fuck off can't you, you pair of pricks?\" While deploring the increasing use of obscenity in police cells and all that, I howled like a timber wolf. </p> <p>For this effect you have to credit virtually everyone - the writer, the actors, the director and the mothers who bore them. </p> <p>In an elegantly circuitous bit of writing, North Square ended with Billy being arrested for a punch he threw in the first reel which we had all forgotten. His clerk sat with him in the police station, his furiously smoked cigarette (there's a whole lot of smoking going on here) scattering sparks in the dark. He said \"I'm gonna look after you, Billy. All of yer. Cos I love yer. No one fucks over one of my boys.\" </p> <p>Stick with this one. </p> <p>The <strong> Scarlet Pimpernel </strong> (BBC1) is back for a three-part series. Twaddle the first time round, but twaddle has its own ineluctable momentum. Its peculiar virtue is that it expands to fill the space available between the lottery and the news. </p> <p>Richard E Grant has quite abandoned the Pimpernel's traditional camouflage - effete dandyism - and might as well wear \"Yoo-hoo! It's Me\" round his hat. However, there now seems to be a conscious attempt to morph Sir Percy Blakeney into an 18th-century James Bond with picklocks and peashooters hidden in assorted orifices. That's certainly one way to play it. The most inventive and Bond-like device - feasibly French too - is an antique diving bell (\"Patent pending\") in which Grant and Emily Bruni (who looks cute in a guillotine) make their final escape. I can't make out what the snake is doing in the story unless it's a friend of the producer.</p>",
  "<p>From his finely cut black clothes to the wall covered with gold and platinum discs, everything speaks of success in Jazzie B's office. The man who was once plain old Beresford Romeo is explaining his policy as head of the Soul II Soul pop group and its newly launched record company. In his patois-inflected cockney twang he stresses the need for a \"vibe\" in the building, insisting that everyone must \"believe 100% in their shit\" and that, today at least, there must be a supply of high-class chardonnay so that there can be \"a decent piss-up\". </p> <p>Someone in the Soul II Soul marketing department is having a birthday and Jazzie insists the \"family\" should stop work and pay respects. \"Look,\" he says, slurping. \"Success has got to be for a reason. It's so we can all enjoy it. An office piss-up is a very serious part of my job. I would be failing as the head of Soul II Soul if I wasn't down with the family.\" </p> <p>Birthdays aside, the Soul II Soul headquarters, in a converted garage in Camden, north London, is buzzing as the press come and go. It's just like old times when Soul II Soul was the hottest name in the British charts, except that this time it's not Jazzie the journalists are looking for, but one of his proteges, a 28-year-old called Jason Chue, or Wookie. The fervour is remarkably similar to 1989, when Soul II Soul reinvented the rasta look as \"funki-dred\" and launched an authentic black British sound while they were about it. Wookie, the first act to be signed by the Soul II Soul label, is being heralded as one of the pioneers of the UK garage/two-step sound. </p> <p>We've been here before, of course. A \"unique black British sound\" seems to surface every few years. In the early 1980s it was the brash jazz-funk of bands such as Light of the World; later it was Soul II Soul. In the 1990s it was drum'n'bass and speed garage. Always lurking in the background is the festering resentment of R&amp;B music and American culture. </p> <p>The odd thing about Wookie is that he is being feted as one of the prime movers of a scene to which he doesn't really belong. His debut album is not strictly UK garage but a gospel/ garage hybrid. The beats are slower, there are proper song structures, and the lyrics about life, new babies and the all-round hassle of existence are likely to send you from the dance floor in furrowed contemplation. </p> <p>\"Some roughnecks nicked our beautiful Soul II Soul insignia off the front of the building, so we must be in demand again,\" says Jazzie, clearly happy that his new signing has livened the place up. \"Wookie's a deep guy. He's not going to chat about any old crap. Like Soul II Soul, he's got something to say. I just want to make sure he doesn't make the mistakes I did. These days he doesn't even get to go home. He comes from the studio back to my gaff to eat and I'll sit there boring the arse off him going, 'When we got the Grammy I went and did this or should have said that.' \" </p> <p>Jazzie still grouses that he won Grammys in the US but never a Brit award over here. \"Fuck 'em,\" he says. \"You can't argue with hit records. People used to say, 'Jazzie, you're just a fucking DJ', but we showed 'em. Who cares about the Brits anyway? The rest of the world sat up and took notice. Neneh Cherry won one and she broke it and gave half to us.\" </p> <p>The rancour belies a new serenity in Jazzie's life. He is trim and fit and, despite grey flecks in his locks, claims to be 36. He likes being in the background, pulling the strings. His mother Blanche's death in February has put business into perspective. Even so, you get the feeling that the spirit of the cheesy ol' Soul II Soul mantra, \"A smiling face, a thumping bass for a loving race\", isn't always observed, especially when he and his disciple have a difference of opinion. </p> <p>\"A smiling face gets you so far,\" says Jazzie. \"But I'm not against kicking someone down the stairs when they start fucking about. Wookie's been there. He knows the score. We're a family here and we've had our fights. He's come through that. He knows he's been close to dismissal in the past. But he showed he had something extra to turn it around. The man's got what it takes, but there was a time when he was nearly out on his arse.\" </p> <p>Downstairs the garage pioneer who nearly wasn't receives guests in his own small studio. A double platinum disc hangs on the wall. \"I'll catch up,\" says Wookie. \"I got a few years on him, haven't I?\" In his den there is a guitar and bass bearing \"Condemned\" stickers. \"They don't work,\" he says. \"But you don't need any of that stuff now. I do everything on computer and keyboard.\" </p> <p>Wookie's musical odyssey couldn't have been more different from his boss's. Jazzie grew up as part of the sound-system underground - mobile discos with huge speakers and an attendant \"crew\" who also customise records by MCing over the top. This still supplies the reggae world with MCs and producers. Though Wookie's father and brother are also immersed in this world, his musical epiphany occurred when he was laid off as a trainee architect during the recession of the early 1990s. He started to mess around with a cheap keyboard, which still sits in his studio today. He didn't even know who Soul II Soul were when he was 17, he says with a laugh. </p> <p>One of his first steps in the business was writing a crass R Kelly pastiche called G Spot for Wayne Marshall in 1994. After he co-wrote half of Marshall's album, they fell out and Wookie went his own way. He passed a tape to Jazzie through the barber they shared, and was signed to Jazzie's production company as an in-house producer. Crucially, Jazzie allowed him to lurk on the payroll finding his feet before pushing him. \"I was writing slow ballads,\" says Wookie. \"Jazzie would come in and say, 'What am I going to do with ballads? I don't do ballads, for fuck's sake!' There's a vault with hundreds of my discarded ballads in there. But he gave me time to learn and make mistakes, which was a godsend.\" </p> <p>Wookie comes across as a bashful, level-headed chap. But that doesn't mean he gets trampled by the voluble, charismatic Jazzie. \"People can be overwhelmed by that Jazzie aura,\" says Wookie. \"But I'm stubborn as hell. In a way we should be at each other's throats, but I think that's why he likes me.\" </p> <p>Next year they'll go head-to-head in the charts. A new Soul II Soul album and a tour vying for attention with Wookie's solo career launch: who will win? They claim they both will. \"I look over his schedule some days,\" says Jazzie. \"An interview, a video shoot, a flight here, a flight there. I think, I wouldn't go near that with a barge pole. But I like the idea that he's keeping this place alive. I like the idea that Soul II Soul won't be another black music enterprise that came and went and was forgotten. Yeah, looking at it that way, I'm glad I never sacked him.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The album Wookie is out on the Soul II Soul label on October 30.</p>",
  "The drama, danger and confusion of life in eastern Europe in the years up to and including the second world war is well reflected in the extraordinary experiences of John Murray, who has died aged 92. Born in Manchester, by the time he was 26 he had become a self-made millionaire as the owner of a Latvian tobacco factory, was then a spy in Moscow at the outbreak of war, before becoming one half of a remarkable cloak-and-dagger romance. <p>He was the son of a Greek immigrant father and a mother of Irish extraction. At 16, he took up the offer of a family friend in Riga to become a clerk at his tobacco factory. Following a dispute over the ownership of the factory in 1931, John took it over, built it up and within three years had become exceedingly rich. However, when, in 1937, the Latvian government nationalised the factory, he lost everything. </p> <p>Undeterred, he started a successful import-export business in Finland. The Russian invasion of 1939 put a stop to this and John escaped to Norway, only to have to flee from there after the German occupation. </p> <p>Back in Riga, now occupied by the Soviets, he was asked to join the British embassy in Moscow. However, before he could leave, the Russian secret police (NKVD) suspected there was more to John's role, accused him of being a German spy and threatened to kill him. For months he spent each night watching the front door, gun in hand. Finally, with the British anxious about his whereabouts, he was rescued by an envoy sent by the British ambassador, Sir Stafford Cripps. </p> <p>It was in Moscow that this mild-mannered Englishman began a romance with a Russian spy called Nora Korzhenko. Blackmailed into becoming a mozhno - a \"sex for secrets\" spy - with the code name Swallow, her first assignment was John, whom the NKVD had correctly surmised was not merely a clerk, but involved in espionage work and an operator of the code-scrambler, Hush - the heart of the secret Allied communications in Russia. </p> <p>Luckily for John, Nora was an unsophisticated spy. Rejected by him at every turn, she finally broke down and blurted out her story. Faced with the responsibility of sending her back to the NKVD empty-handed, John decided to adopt a high-risk strategy. He agreed to meet Nora regularly for \"Russian lessons\", where they concocted stories for her to relate to the NKVD. Nora's bosses finally discovered they were being duped and turned on her, revoking her citizenship. In desperation, she reached out to John. With loyalties now torn between his growing love for Nora and his role at the embassy, John was forced to make a near-impossible decision. He handed her the key to his flat at the British embassy. So long as she remained there she would be safe. </p> <p>The Russians were furious. However, Sir Stafford Cripps gave Nora refugee status and she was permitted to stay. By now John and Nora were very much in love. But by 1941, the German army had almost reached Moscow. The British embassy was hastily evacuated and John ordered to the Arctic base of Archangel, leaving Nora behind. On arrival, he was shocked to find that, as a security risk, he was to be sent back to England. In despair, he phoned Nora to share the news. </p> <p>With faked American documents, Nora escaped from a besieged Moscow, evaded NKVD agents in a 700-mile chase, and reached Archangel - only to discover that John's ship had already sailed, with him a prisoner. In fact, a raging blizzard had forced the ship to anchor a few miles up the coast. By now the temperature had dropped to minus 40C, yet Nora stumbled on through the night. </p> <p>As in the best romances, John just happened to be on deck, and caught sight of a figure staggering towards the ship's jetty out of the snowy wastes. It was Nora. Once safely on board, John proposed. </p> <p>But they still faced another hurdle: it was illegal for any Soviet citizen to leave the country and the captain was under strict orders to take John to Britain. He decided their only chance was to send a telegram to Stalin in the wild hope that he would take pity on them. But even as the message was being sent, Nora was kidnapped by the NKVD and hauled back to Moscow. </p> <p>No one is quite sure why Stalin read John's telegram - even less why he responded. John believed it was because they appealed to the dictator's ego. More likely they were used by Stalin as a bargaining tool, to support his claim to his western allies that things in the Soviet Union were beginning to thaw. </p> <p>Whatever the truth, John and Nora were allowed to leave the country in the spring of 1942, and John returned to England with his young Russian bride. The day after their departure, Stalin annulled the decree. Thus, Nora became the only Russian war-bride to escape the USSR during the second world war. </p> <p>When they got back to England, life was not easy. John was ostracised by the British establishment after his experiences in Russia, although he always claimed he never once betrayed his country. He started a business with a revolutionary new printing process that would enable newspapers to be printed in colour. It was an idea years ahead of its time, but with insufficient capital, the business collapsed.

  "The death in an aircraft accident of the governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan, at the age of 66, has thrown American politics into considerable confusion. Carnahan, legally obliged to retire in January after two terms as governor, was the Democratic candidate in next month's neck-and-neck race for the state's junior Senate seat. <p>Carnahan had become one of Missouri's most successful politicians in recent years, though his path to the governor's mansion was not always smooth. Missouri's electoral laws allow its two chief officers to come from opposing parties. This usually works smoothly, but Carnahan had a tough four years from 1988 while serving as lieutenant governor to John Ashcroft, then the Republican governor and now the senator whose seat is under contest. </p> <p>The two men did not conceal their mutual dislike. During their infighting, Governor Ashcroft went as far as to obtain a court order spelling out in detail how few constitutional powers his deputy could exercise. It was, therefore, with considerable satisfaction that Carnahan swept into the governorship in 1992 by the largest Democratic majority Missouri had seen for 24 years. </p> <p>When a local court ruled against the state's poorly performing school-funding system, Carnahan made its replacement his major priority. In a generally conservative and tax-hating state, he managed to push through a $315m tax increase to create smaller primary school classes and significantly greater vocational training for school-leavers. </p> <p>Politically, Carnahan offset such controversial policies with a firm line on law and order. During his recent Senate campaign he claimed that his introduction of the toughest anti-crime measures in the state's history had lengthened by 10 years the average sentence served by dangerous and violent offenders. </p> <p>Though a firm advocate of the death penalty, he was involved in one highly controversial reprieve during the Pope's visit to St Louis in 1999. The pontiff asked Carnahan to stop the execution of a man who had murdered an elderly couple and their disabled grandson. After some hesitation Carnahan commuted the sentence, but carefully explained that he had done so only because he was moved by papal concern for the prisoner. </p> <p>On bread-and-butter issues, Carnahan's middle of the road policies were widely popular. He claimed to have created 300,000 new jobs with his economic reforms. He also halved the number on welfare, with a welfare-to-work scheme which was enthusiastically praised by President Clinton. </p> <p>Ironically, Missouri's taxpayers also benefited during Carnahan's two terms, from a law introduced 20 years earlier by a conservative Republican. This stipulated that, once state expenditure exceeded a specified level, the administration had to repay a proportion of its tax revenue. The law was triggered by Carnahan's continued spending on education and some $1,000m fell due for repayment over five years. One result, for which Carnahan reaped the credit, was the disappearance of a deeply-unpopular sales tax on food. Such shrewd politicking gave Carnahan another landslide victory in the 1996 election. </p> <p>Politics had been in his blood almost from birth. His father had served six terms in the House of Representatives before becoming US ambassador to Sierra Leone. After gaining a first degree in business administration, Carnahan decided to become an air force pilot, but was thwarted at an early stage by failing the physical examination. Later he obtained a private pilot's licence and regularly flew light aircraft for the rest of his life. </p> <p>Instead of combat service, his two years in the air force were spent with its special investigations unit, sparking an interest in the law. Having obtained a first-class degree from the University of Missouri, he first went into private practice and was then elected a municipal court judge in 1961. In the common American pattern, this proved to be a first step towards a political career. A year later, he secured a seat in the state legislature and was soon chosen as the ruling Democrats' floor leader. </p> <p>This seemingly effortless rise, however, was briefly halted in 1967 when he failed to get a seat in the state senate. His progress resumed in 1980 with his election as Missouri state treasurer. His principal achievement in that role was to clean up the cronyism then rife in the allocation of state contracts. His introduction of mandatory competitive bidding laid a firm base for his successful gubernatorial campaigns. </p> <p>His poor personal relationship with his Republican opponent, at first during the governorship and most recently in the campaign for Harry Truman's old Senate seat, was very out of character. His normal demeanour was that of a courteous, quietly-spoken, country lawyer. In his private life he was active as a deacon of the Baptist church. </p> <p>His eldest son Roger died with him in the accident. The governor is survived by his wife Jean and their three remaining sons. </p> <p>\u0095 Mel Eugene Carnahan, politician, born February 11 1934; died October 17 2000</p>",
  "As the US presidential race unfolds, the similarities between George W Bush and his father's former boss, President Ronald Reagan, become obvious. Like Reagan, Bush is resonating with American voters at a deep, almost visceral level, telling people his instincts, priorities, and personae at a level that is more profound than Al Gore. <p>The point became clear in Tuesday night's final TV debate. Bush was Bush. Friendly, likeable, weatherbeaten, a good man who has lived a full life. Gore was Gore. Pugnacious, determined, aggressive, a strong man who is fighting for the big prize. </p> <p>Everybody knows that Bush may lack the polish and formal training of an Al Gore or a Bill Clinton. Asked to name a book he was reading, he cited a biography of Dean Acheson, and then raised eyebrows by not seeming to know much about the former US Secretary of State. He cannot quote statistics as Gore can. His repertoire of historical anecdotes is not the equal of Bill Clinton's. He often seems at a loss for facts. Just like Reagan. </p> <p>But, like Reagan, he seems to fit comfortably within his own skin. He knows who he is and trusts his instincts about policy. He is settled on why he wants to be president and what he will do when he gets there. He may not have the right answer for every question, but he exudes a sense of self-control and confidence that inspires voters. </p> <p>Americans are falling in love with George W Bush as this election unfolds. Even when Gore bests him in debate, as in their first televised encounter, voters in the US are coming away from the debates with a deep respect and affection for Bush. Gore seems too plastic, too well prepared. </p> <p>Gore comes across as someone who never seems to have lived a real life. Bush shows that he's been through a lot, lived like the rest of us, and had his share of knocks. For a man whose father was president and grandfather was a senator, he reflects an understanding of what it's like to be a regular person that Gore simply fails to project. </p> <p>Caught between the need to attack Bush to close the gap in the polls and the dangers of seeming overly aggressive, Gore should show in public the wit and warmth which those who know him report he evidences in private. Once, at a White House meeting, Gore cracked a small joke at his own expense. When my laughter seemed a bit too hearty, he turned to me and quipped \"self deprecating humour. You should try it sometime.\" </p> <p>Bush keeps bobbing to the surface. When his candidacy first came to public attention, he opened up a large lead in the polls. Gore closed the gap with an excellent speech at his party's August convention. But, a few weeks later, Bush was back on top. Americans just flat out like George W Bush. And, for that reason, if for no other, he is now likely to be their next president. Is it over? No way. In the elections of 1960, 68, 76, 80, 92, and 96 there was a late surge by one candidate in the last two weeks. But every one of the surging candidates came up short and lost. </p> <p>\u0095 Dick Morris was chief strategist for President Clinton in his successful 1996 bid for re-election.

  "\u0095The Diary is delighted to share the solution to one of rock and pop's greatest and most enduring mysteries ... how did Rolf Harris come to record Stairway To Heaven, a number about suicide which Rolf none the less did in his usual style with didgeridoo-esque effects. So how did what is universally regarded as the funniest record in history come about? The answer is an appearance on Australian TV chat show, the Money and the Gun. The gimmick of its presenter, comedian Andrew Denton, was to get each week's star turn to perform the Led Zeppelin classic. Rolf, who had never heard the song, naturally obliged. The reaction was so wildly joyous that soon he had a hit single and was playing it at Glastonbury. Bless his heart (and you do have to love him), it was only when his version had left the charts and the festivals ended that a friend played him the original. Rolf listened raptly, then remained quiet when the record finished. After a while, he found his voice. \"Oh my God,\" he whispered, \"what have I done?\" <p>\u0095This mystery still needs solving: the name of my old friend Gerald Kaufman keeps cropping up in the personal ads section of the London Review of Books. \"Intelligent, old, bald woman, fond of hair, beards and Yeats, but not necessarily Rushdie (doesn't know who Gerald Kaufman is) would like to meet man to 55 who floats above all statistics and percentages,\" ran an ad in the previous edition. \"Gerald Kaufman. This had better be worth the money,\" runs an entry in the current one. Can anyone help? </p> <p>\u0095A press release from Petra Walton at Aurelia PR heralds a launch party for a new DAKS store in the West End, and among the other \"celebrities expected to attend\" - alongside the Danish restaurateur and Sloane wannabe Mogens Tholstrup and the shoemaker Jimmy Choo - is the boulevardier Andrew Neil (Repton, Trinity Cambridge and the Guards). Excellent timing. With the Barclay Brothers bidding for the Express, it's more important than ever that the chief executive sends out the message that, despite all the career setbacks since Murdoch let him go, he remains a man of gravitas and bottom. </p> <p>\u0095Joining Andrew on the list (\"perhaps celebrity in the looser sense\", agrees Petra, when pressed on the point) is Alexandra Aitken, but we are more concerned with her father. For ages Jonathan has been promising to go to Oxford to study theology, and - you won't believe this - it seems he was telling the truth. Jonathan has recently paid cash (our cash, probably, but so what?) for a shiny new bicycle. Good for him; and given the naughty old sausage's sensitivity to coverage here (in his book, he cites a Diary item as the catalyst for his resignation), let me assure him that there will be no snide digs about undergraduate life: the minute we get the money back, in fact, that will be an end to it. </p> <p>\u0095The ancient model of the Atex computer system, which Noah swapped for something less obsolete early in the Ark's voyage (and which was even decommissioned here a year ago), remains in widespread use at the Telegraph Group, and increasingly desperate systems staff recently put out an internet Mayday call for spares. A reply has been received. A local paper in Nigeria says it is buying something more modern, and, would be thrilled to hand over all its Atex stuff. When it works, there is nothing like third world aid, is there? </p> <p>\u0095I am surprised by Richard Littlejohn's pious distaste for the business career of Terry Venables - one that might, Richard suggests, have landed Tel in Ford. The notion that a spell in an open nick should disqualify someone from work seems harsh when Richard's colleague, chief reporter John Kay, was taken back by the Sun after doing bird for killing his wife. I'm not at all sure, on reflection, that you could make it up. </p>",
  "A teenager was killed yesterday when he bent down to inspect a firework that seemed to have gone out after being lit, and it blew up in his face. <p>The body of Paul Ridge, 18, was found on wasteland near the Duke of York pub in Burnley, Lancashire, in the early hours. He had died of head injuries. </p> <p>Apparently the firework was one of a defective batch being sold locally by an unregistered source. </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Graham Gooch, of Lancashire police, said the incident was a tragic waste of a young life. \"It brings home the need for us all to be careful when dealing with this kind of firework,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We can only repeat that this type of firework is lethal. </p> <p>\"It is ironic that this should have happened only hours after the county's trading standards officer and our colleagues from the fire service issued a warning about the dangers of these devices.\" </p> <p>Police are investigating links between the death and other incidents involving fireworks in the Burnley area. </p> <p>On Monday night a firework blew apart a Ford Fiesta car, and a telephone kiosk was destroyed by one at the weekend. </p> <p>David Brown, deputy chief officer at Lancashire trading standards, said: \"It sounds to us as if a rogue batch of fireworks, which were not meant for public sale, has found its way on to the streets.\" </p> <p>They may have been among a batch imported for use only at professional displays. Mr Brown said that trading standards officers were working with police to find out where the fireworks came from and why they were being sold to the public. </p> <p>He said that when fireworks were sold incorrectly, it was often the case that the sales were from the back of vans or at shops not registered with trading standards. </p> <p>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said Mr Ridge's death was the first that was directly linked with fireworks for four years, since stringent legislation banned the sale of mini-rockets and bangers. </p> <p>However, the society added, last year there were 1,056 injuries involving fireworks in the four weeks before bonfire night. </p> <p>\"These were basically where people were misusing fireworks or letting them off in places where they shouldn't have been,\" said a RoSPA spokesman, Roger Vincent. </p> <p>\"As this incident has shown, the golden rule is that you should never return to fireworks after they have been lit, no matter how strong the temptation.\"</p>",
  "Your discussion of the safety of children on school trips (Lest we forget, Education, October 17) refers to the Activity Centres (Young Person's Safety) Act and states that it was brought in by the last government. It was in fact brought in by my private member's bill, despite initial opposition from the then Conservative government. The Major administration later decided to support my bill, which did help to place it on the statute book. This came about after the deaths of four of my young constituents, from Southway in Plymouth (not Dorset, as was stated) in what became known as the Lyme Bay tragedy. <p>I pondered with colleagues the dilemma of including teachers in the legislation and opted for tackling the activity providers, as they have a commercial interest in such matters. Teachers already have many legal obligations of parental responsibility. </p> <p>Just as we learned from Lyme Bay and have minimised major incidents with commercial providers, so we must learn from recent tragedies, in respect of teachers. I am not convinced of the need for more legislation, but for more information and guidelines for teachers and governors. </p> <p>While we do not want to overprotect children, we must not compromise their safety. We want our kids to be able to have excitement and fun, while knowing that they are not in danger. <br><br><b>David Jamieson MP</b></p>",
  "The time has come, surely, for Railtrack to be taken back into public ownership (Disaster strikes at 115mph, October 18). Not only is subsidy being siphoned from taxpayers' pockets to Railtrack shareholders and directors but, worse, no one ever seems to take responsibility for the deaths of increasing numbers of passengers.

The UK has the most disorganised rail network in Europe, with woefully under-resourced infrastructure and rolling stock and a safety regime that borders on the criminally negligent. </p> <p>Why? Principally because for most of the 18 Tory years the industry was progressively run down and starved of long-term investment within a climate of overt ideological hatred of state-owned railways. Ironically, and perhaps a tribute to the then breed of railway professionals, efficiency for a while actually increased in terms of unit operating costs and levels of external financing required. </p> <p>Alas it has proved to be a mirage, since all that was happening was that the assets were being sweated to an unacceptable degree. The recent disasters were waiting to happen. It will continue to get worse for as long as rolling stock and locomotives, plus train crews, are hammered day in and day out. A \"just-in-time\" business operating policy is dangerous in a mass-transit environment and it is time Railtrack and the politicians responsible got their safety priorities right. </p> <p>Of course the cost will be enormous and will be resisted (despite bold talk of a 10-year plan, which will never see the light of day) by the Treasury, as it has done for 50 years.

The carriages remained upright and in line; there were a few minor injuries and no one died. </p> <p>Yesterday a train derailed near Hatfield at a lesser speed (115mph).

  "<p>The future of peer-to-peer computing, or P2P to its friends, came into sharp focus last week with the collapse of Scour.net, the controversial company which allows members to share the files on their computers via the internet. </p> <p>The Beverly Hills-based company backed by former superagent and former Disney president Mike Ovitz became the latest victim of the dot.com crash after falling more than $100m into debt and facing legal action from both the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America that sought to block its exchange services. </p> <p>Unlike Napster, the poster-boy of the peer-to-peer music revolution with more than 30 million registered users, Scour presented a potentially larger threat to the entertainment and information industries: Napster lets users swap only music files. Scour allows them to exchange any type of digitised information, including movies and music. </p> <p>Scour's collapse confirmed an industry-wide problem: the internet, and P2P file-swapping in particular, may be revolutionising the delivery of entertainment, but there are problems to be overcome, and quickly. Not only does wholesale P2P computing threaten the established system of creation, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copyrighted information, but it offers no workable revenue model in return. </p> <p>P2P computing has effectively made the internet into a giant copy machine, allowing users and consumers to communicate and swap far more freely than businesses producing content ever expected and would like. One thing is abundantly clear: whatever happens to companies like Napster and Scour as copyright infringement cases work their way through US courts, peer-to-peer file swapping, whether of music, films, TV programs, books or any other creative, copyrighted media that can be digitised, is not going away. </p> <p>Earlier this month in Washington DC, a publishing industry forum entitled Electronic Book 2000: Changing The Fundamentals Of Reading attracted more than 800 representatives from old-world publishing and dozens of entrepreneurs from start-up online publishers. What they heard from Dick Brass, vice president of technology development at Microsoft, was the prediction that 50% of all new books will be in electronic form within a decade. </p> <p> But Brass went on to say that if e-books become as easy to copy and distribute as MP3 files, the whole tradition of fee-based content publishing could collapse. \"The irony is that the more sophisticated the e-book industry becomes, the more tempting it will be for pirates. There is nothing less at risk than human progress and prosperity.\" </p> <p>Overwrought perhaps, but other speakers at the meeting showed how sophisticated encryption supposed to protect from wholesale copying is sophisticated only until it is broken - which doesn't take very long. \"This is so easy it doesn't even really feel like stealing,\" said Martin Eberhard, former NuvoMedia CEO, giving the encryption-cracking demonstration. </p> <p>Many fear that the Napster generation is habituated to downloading copyrighted materials for free. Trade associations have found that trying to convince them that this is theft is a tough sell. \"The anonymity of the internet gives consumers the feeling that there are no repercussions to piracy,\" says Frank Creighton, the RIAA director of anti-piracy. </p> <p>If the vast number of P2P network users has revealed anything - apart from how much all the world loves a freebie - it is that the market for digitised entertainment content is huge. But that has only added to the burden of trying to control it and finding a way of making it pay. Forrester, the internet research firm, predicts that by 2005, more than $3bn in annual music business revenue will be lost. \"Digital security will not stop theft of content, and neither will lawsuits,\" the report concludes. </p> <p>Lawsuits have become the first line of defence of the entertainment business. But it is not certain that the law will clarify the complex copyright issues at stake, and, even if it can, whether this will make a difference. \"No law can be successfully imposed on a huge population that does not morally support it and possesses easy means for its invisible evasion,\" wrote John Barlow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </p> <p>The challenge of pure P2P computing - that is, sharing content without central control, organisation or intermediaries - is that no one owns it so no one, except perhaps its members, can make money from it. There are lots of unanswered questions about Napster and its counterparts. Could it become part of a pay ment mechanism similar to those adopted by business-to-business or business-to-consumer companies? </p> <p>In court 10 days ago to stave off a preliminary injunction that would shut it down, Napster's lawyer David Boies invoked the argument used when VCRs were introduced. He argued that even if some Napster users are infringing copyright, the service as a whole has non-infringing uses and should not be shut down. Napster executives said they hoped the issue would be settled out of court and proposed to start charging consumers a minimal amount - $5 a-month that would mean $500m a-year for the record industry. </p> <p> While the proposal comes close to the system that many believe will solve the copyright problem, it was quickly rejected by the RIAA. The recording industry does not want distribution controlled by anyone else. But to sustain the system as it is, the music industry will have to kill off the CD - something it is loath to do - to stop digitally perfect, unencrypted music getting out into the world in the first place. </p> <p>So far, at least, it seems that consumers are unwilling to pay for content on the web and will probably not become willing to do so until the broadband future arrives, if then. For proof, the last two months have seen the almost complete collapse of web content providers. Webcasting pioneer Pseudo.com, the online music label Atomic Pop, and the Dreamworks funded Pop.com, have all closed while even web arms of established media companies like MTV have slashed jobs. </p> <p>Even the New York Times, one of the world's premiere content providers, has scrapped plans to float its online division on Nasdaq. Dot.com has become a dirty word as advertisers and venture capitalists flee. </p> <p>As the five big record companies - BMG, Time-Warner, Universal, Sony and EMI - rush to come up with a cohesive way of offering digital music on the web, many doubt there is a workable system. The two basic models being considered are downloading music on a one-off basis - the online reproduction of the current system - or a subscription model similar to Napster's offer - that would give consumers free access to new releases. </p> <p>Until a system is developed that is more attractive than the cowboy P2P systems of Napster and Gnutella, it is hard to see how the record companies can succeed. They must beat Napster at its own game, which effectively means an end to copyright protection. \"The fact is, the record companies have not figured out a way to make money from the internet,\" says one music executive. </p> <p>How then will the music industries and others set for Napster-style bootlegging survive? One answer may to lie in corporate sponsorship. Some see the music industry and publishing industries becoming the marketing arms of big corporations. The two are already closely intertwined so \"Radiohead bought to you by Coca-Cola\" is no longer unimaginable. </p> <p>A business along those lines has already been established. LicenseMusic.com has more than 200 content partners - including NBC and Playboy - seeking original music for projects range from high-end film productions to music in commercials to corporate training videos. With more than 1.4 million tracks from 5,000 musicians, entertainment and advertising ventures looking for content can find any kind of music they want. </p> <p>Once a song has been chosen, the content buyer uses the transaction engine to calculate the price of the licence. Within 15 minutes, the song and licence have been downloaded. So far the site is doing about $50,000 in business per month, with the average licensing deal coming to between $300 and $2,000. </p> <p>Many theorists like John Barlow are coming to recognise that peer-to-peer computing may not be the death of commercial opportunity, rather the start of a different system. As has been widely reported, US CD sales have risen by 20% since MP3 was widely adopted. And however hard Hollywood may be fighting DeCSS, the software used to decode DVDs, it also needs to remember that the VCR, which it fought for years, helped to increase revenue. </p> <p> It was the same with computer software. After fighting duplication, the software industry learnt that the more a program is pirated, the more likely it is to become the standard. In other words, abundance breeds abundance. \"The free proliferation of expression does not decrease its commercial value,\" argues Barlow. \"Free access increases it, and should be encouraged... The war is on, all right, but to my mind it's over. The future will win; there will be no property in cyberspace.\" </p> <p>In other words, peer-to-peer piracy may not turn out to be copyright black hole many fear but instead would lead to a wider distribution of products, streamlining distribution and enabling a broader, faster reach. And that, in the end, can only be an advantage. </p> <p>\"Consumers have spoken,\" said the Forrester report. \"Regardless of whether the record companies consider Napster right or wrong, they must beat Napster at its own game.\" And that holds true for any industry vulnerable to the seemingly unstoppable explosion of P2P networking. </p> <p> <strong> Web addresses </strong></p> <p> <strong>Gnutella</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.gnutella.wego.com\">www.gnutella.wego.com</a> </p> <p><strong>FreeNet</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.freenet.sourceforge.net\">www.freenet.sourceforge.net</a> </p> <p><strong>MyNapster</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.mynapster.com  \">www.mynapster.com</a> </p> <p><strong>OpenNap</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.opennap.sourceforge.net\">www.opennap.sourceforge.net</a> </p> <p><strong>Scour Exchange</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.scour.com\">www.scour.com</a> </p> <p><strong>Aimster</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.aimster.com\">www.aimster.com</a> </p> <p><strong>Gnotella</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.gnotella.nerdherd.net\">www.gnotella.nerdherd.net</a> </p> <p><strong>Gnumm</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.gnumm.wego.com\">www.gnumm.wego.com</a> </p> <p><strong>FileNavigator</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.filenavigator.com \">www.filenavigator.com</a> </p> <p><strong>Napigator</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.napigator.com\">www.napigator.com</a> </p> <p><strong>Riffshare</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.riffshare.com  \">www.riffshare.com</a></p>",
  "<p>On a cold winter's morning, Mrs J looked out of her window and noticed the cows grazing in the field. She remarked to her maid how cruel the farmer was to turn the cows out on such a cold day. The maid replied that the field was empty. Mrs J was amazed. She was sane and sober, and though her eyesight was not of the best, she could see the cows quite clearly. She was experiencing Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS). </p> <p>The condition was first reported in 1760 by Charles Bonnet, a Swiss philosopher. He described the case of his grandfather, who was suffering from cataracts and started to experience \"amusing and magical\" visions. He knew they were not real and found them quite entertaining. </p> <p>The distinguishing feature of Charles Bonnet syndrome is that the patients are in a clear state of consciousness and usually quite aware that what they are seeing is an hallucination. They do not have delusions or other symptoms of mental illness. The hallucinations are notably lacking in any kind of personal meaning. </p> <p>This is in contrast to schizophrenics and others who see visions drawn from their unconscious. As one Charles Bonnet patient put it: \"These images have nothing to do with me.\" The images vary between cases but can be quite consistent. One woman found that she was being followed by a pair of children in Victorian dress. Another saw bright flowers growing everywhere she went. </p> <p>Sometimes the image moves with the patients' gaze rather than staying fixed, and sometimes it disappears if they close their eyes. The image may be blurred or translucent, but sometimes it is clearer and more detailed than real objects. </p> <p>Until quite recently Charles Bonnet syndrome was thought to be an exotic curiosity. Only a handful of cases had been written up, and it was not something that any GP would be likely to diagnose. Then a study in Holland of several hundred patients suffering from macular degeneration (a form of visual impairment common in old age) showed that 12% of them had experienced hallucinations. Further studies confirmed this finding. </p> <p>Literally millions of people have been seeing things. The vast majority have never reported the experience to anyone, let alone a doctor, because they worried about what people would think. Many of them have wondered if they really were going mad. One was even told by her GP: \"You'd better not talk about such silly things!\" A real benefit of recent research is the reassurance to patients that they are entirely sane and that Charles Bonnet syndrome is nothing to do with madness. </p> <p>If it's not the product of psychosis, what is it? Dr Dominic ffytche of the Institute of Psychiatry has been monitoring the brains of CBS patients during their hallucinations. His findings suggest that there are different types of hallucination which are related to activity in different parts of the brain. </p> <p>A minority see inanimate objects. \"I see the trees all the time,\" said one. \"I see them on TV. I see them when I look out my window. I can't go anywhere without seeing those beautiful birch trees.\" Others reported geometric patterns like a brick wall. </p> <p>But the commonest complex images are of people and faces, and this seems to be related to the structure of the brain. The brain has many specialised centres, each processing a different kind of visual information. </p> <p>For example, there is an area associated with movement; if this area is damaged, the patient loses the ability to see moving objects. If there is a spurious signal in the area which recognises a checkerboard pattern, then you see the pattern incorporated into your visual field. </p> <p>Why should spurious activity happen in the first place? One cause is sensory deprivation. When someone's sight is failing, the volume of signals to visual parts of the brain drops off. The understimulated brain may start generating signals of its own to fill in the increasing gaps. </p> <p>Another factor may be \"background noise\" in the brain. While you are looking at random shapes like clouds or a log fire, your brain is constantly looking for meaningful patterns even where there are none. Clouds become animals, and odd faces are revealed in the flames. In CBS, these attempts to find patterns may be overwhelming what little signal is there. </p> <p>CBS also occurs in those with normal eyesight, caused by factors ranging from migraine and strokes to disordered sleeping patterns and even flashing lights. </p> <p>Dr ffytche reasons that if CBS hallucinations are caused by brain activity then they should fall into types that correspond to different parts of the brain. His research bears this out. One group of patients reported seeing people, sometimes small or tiny, often wearing distinctive period clothes or uniforms and hats. A second group saw disembodied faces - mainly grotesque or distorted with bulging eyes. The first group corresponds to disturbances in the ventral temporal lobe, the area which identifies figures and costumes; the second group with the STS region, which is specialised for facial recognition. </p> <p>We can readily imagine the effect of CBS visions on the experiencer, especially in a less scientific age. An old person with failing eyesight living in isolation might very well start to see colourful little figures, perhaps wearing outlandish clothes. These little people would be amusing and magical, visible but not quite solid, with a tendency to van ish if you blinked or took your eye off them. Fairies and pixies, leprechauns and their kind may not be myths at all. They may be visitors from that most wondrous of mystical realms, the hidden kingdom of the human mind. The chosen few who can see them (and their cows), tend to stay silent about it. We can only wonder at what other denizens will appear as science sheds light into the workings of the brain. </p> <p>\u0095 Dr Ffytche is collecting descriptions of CBS hallucinations, and can be contacted at d.ffytche@iop.kcl.ac.uk or Institute of Psychiatry, De Crespigny Park, London SE5 8AF.</p>",
  "<p>The internet may one day lead to sedentary dystopias of homeworking and virtual travel by means of cybersuits and streaming 3D videos, but not yet. Unsettled souls are still going overseas to work and sample life abroad. </p> <p>Expatriates get a bad press. In their little bubbles in towns and cities around the globe, they are commonly viewed as eternal holidaymakers, tax dodgers or, according to JG Ballard's Cocaine Nights, exiles from social reality. </p> <p>While good travel guides and relocation experts ease the move for some mobile workers, the internet can absorb these roles and more. Type \"expat\" into a search engine like Google and you get hundreds of company-based and amateur sites. These have recently been joined by professional operations such as <a href=\"http://www.netexpat.com\">Net Expat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.expatfinancial.com\">Expat Financial</a>. </p> <p>Chue Chi Meng, who has edited a <a href=\"http://www.expatsingapore.com\">Singapore-based site</a> since 1997, estimates that the country has about \"400,000 white-collar expats, mainly from the US, Europe and Japan\", working in high-earner posts. Chue's aim is to \"establish a virtual expat community and bring together the advertiser and user. We provide useful content to all expats - from those arriving, looking for work, homes, schools, mobile phones, to those looking to travel and entertain themselves\". </p> <p>Chue owns the site with his wife and they have registered 12 domain names in Asia, shortly starting up sites in Hong Kong, Korea, Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. </p> <p>Europe attracts expatriates in all sectors, from top-flight business positions to low-paid English teaching and catering work. Simon Payn, who left The Birmingham Post to join <a href=\"http://www.expatica.com\">Expatica</a> in January, is editorial director at the company's flagship Netherlands site. He sees the 250,000 English-speaking expats in Holland as a heterogenous community. \"Some get their flights, accommodation etc found and paid for - they are really looked after by their companies. But many others, probably the majority, are not helped much at all and face the realities of Dutch life - finding a flat (which in Amsterdam, for example, can be difficult and expensive), registering with the authori ties, making friends, finding a school for their children.\" </p> <p>Payn also sees the internet as an emotional resource. \"Arriving in a new country can be a daunting and lonely experience. A website can provide a central point of reference for expats. As well as reading the site, our visitors can interact with other expats in our discussion forums, email the editor with questions and comments, place classified ads. A lot of our ideas for content come from our readers.\" </p> <p>Expatica, which has received seed funding from the Dutch government, recently launched in Belgium. </p> <p>Not all sites are local. <a href=\"http://www.expatexpert.com\">Expat Expert</a>, one of several global sites teeming with links, highlights the hassles experienced by spouses and families. Robin Pascoe, a Canadian author who edits the site, explains: \"Many of the visitors to my site are unwilling expats. I write in the context that expat life is indeed a privilege and a wonderful opportunity. But having said that, I try to reassure women especially that they are still allowed some time for transition and have permission not to be happy 100% of the time!\" </p> <p>Certainly there can be a downside to being an ex-pat wife - particularly if you are caught in the middle of a riot while taking your daughter to a Girl Scout's show in Indonesia. You can read an account of such an experience at <a href=\"http://www.expat-moms.com\">www.expat-moms.com</a> a site especially for women who, as their motto says, \"give their children the world\". </p> <p>The site offers advice on other important topics for mothers such as raising bilingual children and making a relocation checklist. </p> <p>On the business side, tno single global supersite has emerged to date, though the expat-friendly European Internet Network has spread quickly across Russia, China, the Balkans and Eastern Europe (see <a href=\"http://www.russiatoday.com\">www.russiatoday.com</a>). </p> <p>As markets go, expatriates are often a small but wealthy segment of any major city; globally, they are a very attractive proposition. On the e-commerce front, expatriate Brits for instance - who typically miss their M&amp;S underwear, curry paste and TV comedy shows - are potentially a soft target for exporting. </p> <p>So will future expats travel thousands of miles to stay in and check out the footie on the web at home? Will there be a global community of armchair expatriates, bonded together by nostalgia and friendlessness and the subconscious need to go home or, indeed, elsewhere? </p> <p>Not likely. The spirit of most sites is basically \"click on to get a life\" and expats are often travel mad. </p> <p>Virtual reality might have its advantages, but in the hazy, never quite real world of expatria, it is as liable to still itchy feet as driving to work in the rain back home. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Moss is editor of <a href=\"http://www.expatvillage.com\">www.expatvillage.com</a>, a site for expatriates in Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>",
  "<p><strong> French at the spin of a CR-rom</strong></p> <p><strong> Learn To Speak French </strong> The Learning Company \u00a340 Version 8 for Windows 95/98 <br> Some things are very right indeed. It really helps to see the text as you hear it: it also helps to be able to subliminally check the translation. Those of us who have never managed the French \"r\" are encouraged to think that, that with the help of a very precise female narrator, we might at least hope to do better. </p> <p>There are things to quibble at from lesson 1: when you meet a young lady in France, you probably shouldn't begin by saying \"Tu t'apelles comment?\" unless she really means it when she says: \"On peut se tutoyer.\" </p> <p>The accompanying situation cartoons are expressive without being cute (a handshake here, a big exclamation mark there) and the choice of dialogue situations seems pretty close to the format and bruising speed any traveller is likely to meet in casual encounters: who could resist \"J'aime toute de sorte de musique, sauf l'opera\"? </p> <p>You can compare your voice with the speaker's and score on a tourist-native scale. You can also set your own pace, and click the translation on or off. There are some helpful notes on the idioms. \"C'est pas terrible\" for instance is glossed as \"It's ... different\" which shows a nice ear for nuance. At the more ambitious level, there are disappointments. The \"cultural movies\" on disc 4 are fairly thuddding travelogues around Rouen, Paris, Nimes, Mont St Michel and so on: all panning shots and appropriate music (guess what they play while showing you the Pont d'Avignon?). </p> <p>By this stage, you should be up for a bit of serious narration (you have, after all, the English and French texts there on the screen as well, and you can click back to the bit you didn't quite get and run it again) and even a bit of serious cultural explanation. </p> <p>But all in all, much encouraged.

That's what James Gillies and Robert Cailliau have done, but given the title of their book, you can hardly complain. What it says is what you get. </p> <p>The book is, of course, special in being co-authored by two scientists from Cern in Switzerland, Europe's particle physics laboratory, where the World-Wide Web was created. Indeed, one was so closely involved that in the early 90s, we used to credit Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau for its development. </p> <p>But in 1995, TBL went off to start the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT, Cern's web work was trans ferred to Inria in Paris, and that's where this story ends. </p> <p>Most of the first half of the book is devoted to computer history, starting in the 40s. Topics include the origins of the internet; Doug Engelbart, the inventor of the mouse; and Ted Nelson, who coined the term hypertext and conceptually pre-invented the web. It also covers the Viewdata (text to TV) saga, including BT's Prestel and France Telecom's Teletel (Minitel). </p> <p>The book's European perspective is interesting, but these fields have been ploughed many times before. </p> <p>The story of the web's development at Cern is told in sometimes excruciating detail, with Cailliau being treated just like any other character. This approach is fair, and seems to ensure that even the minor participants are given their due. </p> <p>However, you may still be left with the impression that TBL would have developed something like the web wherever he'd ended up, but without him, Cern would never have given birth to the web.

  "<p>Digital video is transforming the film business. Established director/producers such as George Lucas and Mike Figgis are experimenting with the system. Lucas shot some scenes from Star Wars - Episode 1 in this format and has been digitally projecting it in some US cinemas. He is currently using high-definition digital cameras from Sony to shoot most of the next episode. </p> <p>Figgis has just made a technically accomplished and critically acclaimed success of shooting Time Code on four digital cameras which have been transferred onto 35mm film in split screen format. </p> <p>In the UK, the revolution in projection is under way with three cinemas equipped to project features digitally. These include the Odeon Leicester Square, where Pixar's Toy Story 2 was shown in digital format to a regular commercial audience. </p> <p>Now the feature film business faces yet another revolution in coming to terms with the increased access of young first-time filmmakers to cheap, high quality digital equipment. </p> <p>Prior to Lucas's experiments with digital projection, two young American filmmakers, Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler, created movie history in October 1998 by shooting The Last Broadcast on digital camcorders, and beaming it via satellite to cinemas in the US where it was projected digitally on equipment supplied by a UK company, Digital Projection. They used the same digital projectors for their European tour. Now they have made VHS copies for home rental. The cost of shooting the movie was reputedly$900. </p> <p>\"When people ask me how much they need to make a feature,\" says Peter Broderick, digital filmmaking guru and founder of Next Wave Films, \"I ask them how much they have, because that will probably be enough.\" </p> <p>His company, an offshoot of the Independent Film Channel, specialises in practical support for digital film makers with an individual vision, including providing finishing funds and even complete production budgets up to $300,000. The company is experimenting with Sony PD150 cameras and Final Cut Pro editing software on a G4 Mac with practical support from Apple. </p> <p>It is encouraging that big manufacturers are backing emerging talent. Supervising the UK production of The Trouble With Men And Women, Liz Rosenthal says: \"This kind of equipment gives filmmakers a lot of creative freedom. They don't have to wait three or four years to get their film financed - they can get started immediately.\" </p> <p> First time director Tony Fisher says: \"Shooting with two cameras all the time has been great from a performance point of view but we have ended up shooting far more footage than we would have done on film - we're suffering a bit in post production.\" </p> <p>The first cut has gone to Broderick in the US for his comments. When complete, Next Wave will push it round the festivals and try to get a distribution deal. Whatever happens there is always the outlet of the Independent Film Channel. \"Shooting on DV,\" says Fisher, \" has enabled me to find a balance between the constraints of low budget and creativity, between compromise and art, and has given me a new intimacy with performance.\" </p> <p>Next Wave Films also provided marketing and festival distribution advice to Elemental Films on One Life Stand. This feature has just been shown at the Edinburgh Film Festival in a digitally projected launch by Scottish filmmaker May Miles Thomas. It was shot using Sony VX 1000 digital camcorders and edited on a desktop computer using FAST DV Master Pro with In-sync Speed Razor software. Despite a budget in the low five figures it has received a good deal of critical acclaim. </p> <p>\"There's a false assumption about what a camcorder movie is,\" says Miles Thomas. \"With One Life Stand, the aim was to bury the technology and concentrate on the craft of storytelling.\" </p> <p>While developing her own career, Miles Thomas wants to pass on her experiences of devising new ways of working with digital technology to aspiring filmmakers. She will be backed in this by the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta),which has awarded her a fellowship. </p> <p>Elemental Films has received the latest editing software from In-sync and help from Digital Projection in showing the movie at international film festivals. Sony will also be providing consultancy and backup for their next project which will be shot on high definition digital cameras. </p> <p>\"We are entering an age,\" says Broderick, \"when shooting a feature is becoming as accessible as painting a canvas or writing a novel.\" </p> <p>That is true up to a point, but plays down the difficulty of writing or painting and makes filmmaking sound a pushover. Low-budget digital filmmakers have to wrestle with technical problems that more expensive systems are designed to circumvent. Distribution is also a problem, though the market is easing with the explosive growth of digital TV channels and the sale of films on DVD. </p> <p>But at least film makers are now freer to wrestle with the big creative challenges of writing a cracking script, recruiting talented actors, and through the rigorous process of shooting and editing, creating a movie to inspire and entertain an audience. </p> <p> <strong> Web addresses</strong> </p> <p> Next Wave Films <br> <a href=\"http://www.nextwavefilms.com \">www.nextwavefilms.com</a> </p> <p>The Last Broadcast <br> <a href=\"http://www.tebweb.com/lastbroadcast \">www.tebweb.com/lastbroadcast</a></p> <p> Elemental Films <br> <a href=\"http://www.elementalfilms.co.uk  \">www.elementalfilms.co.uk</a></p>",

Which is fine as long as you're building a happy community - but a different story when it comes to sending Benny and Bjorn into battle. </p> <p>Because yours is not the only tribe trying to build a new life in the new world. There are Inuits and Native Americans here, too. </p> <p>For a time, you will be able to coexist and trade peacefully, but eventually resources are going to run out, tensions are going to rise, and you're going to have to build a graveyard next to that woodcutter's tent. </p> <p>This odd disjunction between cuteness and horror is one of many in Cultures: another is the disparity of timescales, which allows you to conceive a child, bring him up, train him as a soldier and send him to his death in the time it takes for Ingmar to recce the west of the island. </p> <p>Furthermore, while some characters, such as bakers and fishermen, will happily beaver away unassisted, seeking out their own materials, others - scouts, soldiers, builders - crave attention like a rock star's daughter, having to be told where to go, what to do, even when to eat and sleep. </p> <p>Given the prospective size of your settlement, the complexity of the infrastructure, and the fiddliness of the interface, this is no small task. </p> <p>On the other hand, the pace of the game is so infernally slow - a coastal raid with these particular Vikings turns into a two-week beach holiday - that keeping tabs on them all is easier than you'd think. </p> <p>In sum, then, Cultures is a thoughtful, jolly, ruddy-cheeked affair, put together with a great deal of love and attention - and, to be brutal, very little concern for playability. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Veteran racing champion is overtaken<br> F1 Championship Season 2000 </strong> Sony PlayStation \u00a334.99 Electronic Arts **** <strong> Formula One 2000 </strong> Sony PlayStation \u00a325-30 Studio 33/Psygnosis *** <br> When you load Formula One 2000, you wonder if PlayStation graphics have improved at all in the past four years. Then when you run F1 Championship Season, the full-motion video and fabulous tracks make you wonder why all PSX games aren't as brilliant as this. </p> <p>Formula One 2000 is in its fifth year and the series has sold more than 4 million units. It has a commentary by Murray Walker, and while the starting interface is clunky, it is very easy to play. Overtaking is simple, and you can take long excursions across the greens and gravel traps and still win races. If other cars are in the way, bumping them up the gearbox often helps. </p> <p>F1 Championship Season 2000 is a completely different matter. EA's second annual trip to the starting grid is a vastly more realistic simulation. The tracks, which ought to be the same, seem much shorter, and the corners are harder to get round, unless you brake well in advance. </p> <p>Bump into other cars and shards of carbon fibre fly in all directions. Go off the track and you frequently end up pointing the wrong way while a dozen cars stream past. </p> <p>Eventually you lose gears, wheels fly off, and you end up retiring rather than winning. The game is a bit more forgiving that the real thing, but 16 laps of precision racing is still a challenge. </p> <p>The simulation continues in staggering detail through all the testing, qualifying and racing through all kinds of weather. And while you don't get Murray Walker (as a driver, you wouldn't), you do get realistic race intros from Jim Rosenthal and in-race instructions from your pit crew. The only real problem is that the controls are very twitchy and take some getting used to, though this could also be true to life. </p> <p>Psygnosis's Formula One 2000 is still a good game, and after EA's F1, you get to appreciate the (unrealistically) easy overtaking and (unrealistic) on-screen map of the circuit. Its arcade option is great fun, especially in two-player mode. </p> <p>While F1 Championship Season 2000 also has a quick race mode, its simulation takes the genre to a level we never expected to see on a PlayStation. I can hardly wait for the PlayStation 2 version. (JS)</p>"
