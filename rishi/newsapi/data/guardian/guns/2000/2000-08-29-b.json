  "An American woman, sentenced in 1996 to life in a Peruvian prison for her alleged role in a terrorist plot, took a significant step towards freedom yesterday after a military court revoked her conviction for terrorism and granted her a new civilian trial. <p>Lori Berenson has maintained her innocence since her arrest in Lima on charges of conspiring with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to mount an attack on Peru's congress. Under the country's draconian anti-terrorism laws, she was tried by military judges wearing balaclavas to hide their identity. Her lawyers were not permitted to cross-examine the government witnesses against her, including a former housemate who claimed to have been her lover.</p> <p>Ms Berenson, now 30, has been incarcerated in remote mountain prisons, where the high altitude and cold have taken a toll on her health and she now suffers from intermittent blindness in one eye.</p> <p>Ms Berenson's fate became a political issue in this year's controversial election campaign, when President Fujimori denounced his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, for suggesting he would review her case. The president accused Mr Toledo of being soft on terrorism and swore the American woman would never be freed.</p> <p>The Supreme Military Justice Commission gave no reason for its surprise announcement on Wednesday revoking Ms Berenson's life sentence, but diplomatic observers speculated that the decision was an attempt to improve relations with the US strained by Ms Berenson's trial and by the May elections, which US and other international observers dismissed as rigged.</p> <p>Philip Reeker, a state department spokesman, told journalists: \"Since Ms Berenson's conviction nearly five years ago, we have maintained that the trial proceedings against her did not meet due-process standards, and so we welcome the court's decision.\"</p> <p>No date has been set for a new trial and Ms Berenson's parents have expressed concern over the independence of the civilian courts, raising doubts that she would receive a fair trial. \"There is no basis in truth or law for holding Lori another day,\" her father, Mark Berenson, said.</p> <p>Ms Berenson was arrested in November 1995 in a crackdown on the MRTA by Peru's security forces. The treason charges hinged largely on the testimony of an MRTA member, Pacifico Castrellon, who claims to have been her boyfriend, but whom she has described as only a housemate. Her lawyers claim he agreed to implicate her in the hope of mitigating his own sentence.</p> <p>At the time of Ms Berenson's arrest, the MRTA was a fairly minor rebel group which had carried out a string of kidnappings and killings. A year after she was imprisoned, the movement rose to worldwide notoriety with its seizure of the Japanese ambassador's residence, leading eventually to its storming by government troops in April 1997.</p> <p>The police say they found seven automatic rifles in the house Ms Berenson shared with Mr Castrellon, together with 8,000 rounds of ammunition, 100 hand grenades and more than 2,000 sticks of dynamite. Ms Berenson claimed to have no knowledge of how the weapons came to be there.</p>",
  "<p>Mining and metals group Billiton extended its buying spree yesterday, taking control of Australia's Worsley alumina refinery for $1.5bn (\u00a31bn). </p> <p>Billiton announced an agreement to buy 56% of the plant from USaluminium mining group Alcoa, taking the London-listed South African miner's stake in the outback refinery to 86%. </p> <p>The group said the plant, which is one of the world's most efficient, would provide a low-cost source of supply for its growing aluminium smelting operations. </p> <p>Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium maker, is selling its controlling stake in Worsley as a condition of its acquisition this year of Reynolds Metals. The Worsley sale is expected to be complete next January.</p> <p>\"I believe this acquisition establishes Billiton as the world's premier up-stream aluminium producer,\" Billiton chairman and chief executive Brian Gilbertson said.</p> <p> But the market reacted unfavorably to the news that the deal would be partially funded by a $750m share offer. The stock fell 10%, finishing the day at 270p.</p> <p> News of the deal overshadowed Billiton's results, as it reported a 51% surge in net profit for the year ended June 30 to $577m, at the high end of market expectations.</p> <p> It also declared a total dividend for the year of 11.25 US cents a share, up 7% on 1998-99. Billiton shares have fallen 26% so far this year, underperforming the mining sector by more than 11%.</p> <p>The market has been less than enthusiastic about its spate of purchases, including recent forays into the copper and ironore industrie. </p> <p>But John Meyer, a mining analyst at SG Securities, said the market was being too short-termist in its view.</p> <p> \"Billiton are putting in place the building blocks for a substantial growth strategy in future years,\" he said.</p> <p> Billiton's Brian Gilbertson said the mining industry was going through a period of unparalleled consolidation. </p> <p>\"Increasingly, it seems the metal and mining business, with the possible exception of aluminium and gold, is likely to be dominated by a small number of very large, multi-commodity companies, operating internationally.</p> <p>\"Companies have been under pressure to cut costs in the aftermath of the crash in metals prices sparked by the Asian financial crisis three years ago. </p> <p>Rising demand sparked a recovery in commodity prices from the middle of last year, but the sector was hit by the hi-tech boom, which saw investors dumping old economy stocks in favour of dot.coms Analysts are hopeful that rising world demand will push up metals prices and justify the expensive acquisition programmes of the larger companies.\"What we are seeing the larger mining companies buying up undervalued assets in preparation for an improvement in commodity prices,\" said Mr Meyer.</p>",
  "Claustrophobes and party animals might feel it takes the concept of intimate dining a bit too far. But for lovers blind to the outside world, or business people plotting commercially sensitive deals, a private club in London has developed just the thing: a restaurant the size of a broom cupboard that it claims is the smallest dining room in the world. <p>The two metre by three metre Montblanc Room at Mosimann's in south-west London contains a single table with a curved bench. The doors can be locked, diners can control the lighting and music, and eavesdropping waiters are not an issue: they will not enter the room unless summoned by a buzzer. </p> <p>The room - part of celebrity chef Anton Mosimann's London restaurant - can be hired by members and non-members for \u00a3100 on top of a restaurant bill likely to reach \u00a360 a head. Staff at the establishment say it has already proved popular with couples who want to be alone and at least one pair of executives. \"It is a beautifully subtle room with sensuous curved edges, shiny black velvet, luxurious gold and the famous Montblanc white star,\" enthused Denise Elliot of Mosimann's. </p> <p>But even the customer-controlled air conditioning cannot quite banish the whiff of corporatism from this idyll. The room is sponsored by the German pen manufacturer Montblanc, and cabinets lining its walls display some of the company's merchandise. The food critic Egon Ronay said the miniature restaurant could eliminate some of the frustrations of modern dining. \"One of the curses of good restaurants is that the waiters won't leave you alone, always clearing some crumbs away or asking you how the meal was,\" he said. \"I proposed to my wife in a restaurant 34 years ago and I could certainly have done with a private room.\" He thought he would have used it when younger - \"without the knowledge of my wife\". </p> <p>But the establishment was quick to deny rumours electrifying the London restaurant world that the room had been providing amorous diners with the opportunity to satisfy other appetites. \"That's not really the kind of image we want to convey.\"</p>",
  "The loyalist feud which erupted in Belfast last week threatened to spread throughout Northern Ireland last night as a hardline faction vowed to avenge a gun attack on a house in Co Londonderry which left an 11-year-old girl in intensive care. <p>RUC officers were last night questioning three men who were arrested after the attack. </p> <p>Charlene Daly was hit in the back when her family's home on the loyalist Ballysally estate in Coleraine was raked with machine gunfire on Monday night. She suffered a collapsed lung and broken ribs. </p> <p>Charlene was stable in the city's hospital last night, but doctors said she was lucky to be alive. They said she was bending over at the time of the attack and the bullet passed beneath her shoulder blade. Had she been standing up, it would have gone through her heart. The bullet is lodged in her back. </p> <p>Her father, Frank, is a former Ulster Defence Association prisoner. He pulled his younger daughter, Coleen, to the floor as the gunfire began. His wife, Yvonne, was unhurt. </p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, said he was appalled, and backed RUC chief constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan's decision to order troops to swamp the Coleraine flashpoint. \"I am outraged that an innocent child should be drawn into a feud between paramilitary gangsters,\" Mr Mandelson said. \"This violence must end here and now.\" </p> <p>Police sources said the assailants, believed to be from the rival Ulster Volunteer Force, sprayed the house with 19 bullets. They focused on the living room, where the family was watching television, and the girls' upstairs bedroom. One of the bullets hit Coleen's bed. </p> <p>Alistair Campbell, a cousin of the family and chairman of the local branch of the Ulster Democratic party, linked to the UDA and Ulster Freedom Fighters, said the UVF had tried to wipe out the family. </p> <p>Charlene's family allowed newspapers to photograph her as she lay in intensive care with an oxygen mask around her face. A UDA source indicated that the organisation would retaliate, saying: \"This is our problem in this area and we will sort it out.\" </p> <p>Billy McFarlane, a family friend, said: \"It was an attempt to take out the complete family. The gunmen - and they were obviously local people - knew the exact layout of the house and fired head-high.\" </p> <p>Security sources are deeply concerned at the escalation of the murderous feud, which claimed the lives of three men in the Shankill Road area of Belfast last week. They are particularly worried about a planned UVF parade in the area on Saturday. </p> <p>There were three attacks at the weekend in Coleraine before the shooting, the only significant incidents outside Belfast. Mr Campbell's house was one of two attacked with pipe bombs on Saturday. </p> <p>Attempts were continuing on the Shankill Road to defuse the tensions. Leaders from the UDA and UVF are to meet soon in a first effort to find a truce since the dramatic return to prison last week of UFF commander Johnny Adair, who was suspected of orchestrating much of the conflict. </p> <p>Finding a lasting solution could prove difficult. The UDA's army council is divided about whether to take on the UVF, but each of its six brigades largely has a free hand to decide on tactics in its own patch. The UDA's north Antrim brigade is responsible for the Coleraine area. </p> <p>John White, chairman of the UDP, warned last night that the feud could spread all over the province. He said the main groups should call a ceasefire, even for a short time, to allow talks to take place. </p> <p>Ken Wilkinson, of the Progressive Unionist party which is allied to the UVF, refused to condemn the latest attack but wished Charlene a speedy recovery. \"I have asked both factions to take a step backwards. It was inevitable there was going to be either loss of life or serious injury,\" he said. \"Rather than condemn the attack, we need to be working towards making sure there are no more incidents.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Queen has approved in principle the awarding of special medals to prison staff in Northern Ireland in recognition of their professionalism, bravery and commitment over 30 years, Mr Mandelson said yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>It's many years since a new oil exploration and production company was brought to the London stock market but with crude prices continuing to soar it was perhaps inevitable that someone would try. </p> <p>Fusion Oil &amp; Gas, of British and Australian origins, plans an AIM listing plus a placement for \u00a315m next month and hopes to emulate the success of Tullow Oil and Gas. </p> <p>A recent offering to raise \u00a342m by the Irish E&amp;P company on the back of acquiring new North Sea gas producing assets was heavily oversubscribed. And Ramco Energy showed the potential for small players to produce big bucks when it sold interests in Azerbaijan for more than its own capitalisation. </p> <p>Fusion is a different animal from Tullow, concentrating on exploration in speculative regions north of west Africa and some way from the finds of Nigeria and Angola. </p> <p>Fusion's portfolio will be given a boost today with confirmation that it has been awarded the Croix du Sud licence in an area administered by the governments of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. One of its main plays is Mauritania where it holds virgin offshore acreage and has brought in blue chip names such as Italy's Agip and Woodside Petroleum of Aus tralia. </p> <p>North-west Africa has attracted attention recently because of an onshore find in Morocco and plans by Shell to drill offshore next year. </p> <p>But what else has Fusion got in its locker? The management team comes from a credible oil and gas background. Chairman Peter Dolan was a veteran explorer with Mobil and Ball &amp; Collins (now Premier Oil) before establishing the Ikoda consultancy with Fusion managing director Alan Stein. Exploration director Jonathan Taylor is a former Amerada Hess and Clyde man and there is a smattering of known non-executives from the world of E&amp;P such as Derek Williams, former boss of Charterhall. </p> <p>There is technical expertise here through the work Ikoda undertook for Shell in state-of-the-art areas such as 4D seismic and reservoir engineering. But does all this add up to a sound investment when Fusion comes to market? There is a clear strategy, with technology and management to back it up. </p> <p>But ultimately it all depends on the drill bit. For those who like a touch of the Indiana Jones about their investments then here is an opportunity. The rest of us will be content to cheer from the sidelines.</p>",
  "Self-styled vigilantes attacked the home of a hospital paediatrician after apparently confusing her professional title with the word \"paedophile\", it emerged yesterday. <p>Dr Yvette Cloete, a specialist registrar in paediatric medicine at the Royal Gwent hospital in Newport, was forced to flee her house after vandals daubed it with graffiti in the middle of the night. </p> <p>The word \"paedo\" was written across the front porch and door of the house she shared with her brother in the village of St Brides, south Wales. </p> <p>Dr Cloete, 42, confirmed she had left the property after the \"distressing\" attack. \"For the time being I have moved out of the area because when something like this happens you just cannot feel safe in your own home. </p> <p>\"We removed the graffiti within hours, but what happened was terrible and it has been extremely distressing.\" </p> <p>Gwent police confirmed that the attack last Friday night was prompted by a confusion over the words \"paedophile\" and \"paediatrician\". </p> <p>Inspector Andrew Adams said: \"It appears to be the case. We are still making inquiries. We want to stress in the strongest possible terms that there is nothing to justify what was written on the walls and door of Dr Cloete's home.\" </p> <p>He said every effort was being made to find the people responsible for the attack. \"These people should think long and hard about what they have done to a valuable member of the community, who has devoted her life to helping children. </p> <p>\"We are concerned that some people in the local community have taken it upon themselves to do this, and would urge them to think about the consequences of their inaccurate and inappropriate actions.\" </p> <p>The Royal Gwent hospital described Dr Cloete as a top-class specialist in children's diseases. A spokesman said: \" She is a valued and respected member of the paediatric team, where she has worked for the last two and a half years.\" </p> <p>A neighbour of the doctor and her brother said: \"They are decent people who we get on very well with. It is very unfortunate that something like this has happened.\" </p> <p>Dr Cloete is the latest victim to have been wrongly identified by anti-paedophile campaigners in the wave of protests which have swept the country following the News of the World's campaign to \"name and shame\" alleged sex offenders. </p> <p>Five families who were wrongly identified as harbouring sex offenders were forced to flee their homes in the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth as violence flared earlier this month. </p> <p>The Sunday tabloid wants the government to introduce a law allowing people access to information on the identities and addresses of paedophiles in their areas.</p>",
  "Lives are being put at risk by the failure of the office of fair trading to crack down on rogue dealers who sell dangerous vehicles which kill 300 people a year, MPs warn today. <p>In their report, MPs on the public accounts committee condemned the OFT for treating unscrupulous car dealers too leniently. Its officials admitted during the MPs' investigation that it had struggled to crack down on these dealers. </p> <p>\"The OFT told us that it was unsatisfactory that they could not do better for British consumers, especially in the used car industry where the safety of motor vehicles was concerned,\" the report said. </p> <p>\"Over 300 people had been killed on the roads in 1999 because of unroadworthy vehicles, and some of these might not have been properly maintained by people who should not be in the business. They said there was nothing the OFT could do to put someone out of this kind of business.\" </p> <p>The OFT blamed legal loopholes for hampering its efforts to crack down on traders who flout consumers' legal rights. MPs said the government accepted the need for tougher legislation, but they blamed the OFT for failing to take tougher action. </p> <p>David Davis, Tory chairman of the committee, said: \"Consumer credit licences are hardly ever refused or revoked, even while some licensed traders hold serious criminal convictions. It is quite shocking that the OFT have only once applied to the courts for a contract to be revised. The OFT have consistently failed to take opportunities to show traders that they will not tolerate rip-offs.\" </p> <p>His criticism of the OFT, the statutory body which is supposed to protect consumers by upholding trading standards, was sparked by the disclosure that convicted criminals have been allowed to continue in business for years. </p> <p>It took the OFT 13 years to suspend the licence of one convicted trader and 16 years to ban another who consistently infringed consumers' rights. </p> <p>The report said: \"The OFT's powers to revoke traders' consumer credit licences can be an effective sanction in many industries, because revoking a licence can put a trader out of business. </p> <p>\"Some traders obtain or continue to hold a licence despite convictions for serious criminal offences. The OFT need to improve the way they check applications and obtain timely information on convictions.\" </p> <p>However, the MPs agreed with the OFT that its work was hampered by the law. Trading standards officers complained that gaining access to the police national computer, the best source of information on whether traders have previous convictions, was difficult. </p> <p>The MPs said: \"We urge that the question of the OFT's access to the computer should be considered as a matter or urgency.\"</p>",
  "Women's groups reacted with anger yesterday on learning that a prison doctor jailed this month for assaulting his wife is serving his sentence at a private clinic famous for treating the addictions of football and showbusiness stars. <p>Kevin McGuigan, 45, former senior medical officer at Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight, was imprisoned for 15 months for assault causing actual bodily harm and for firearms offences. </p> <p>The doctor, who is understood to have treated some of Britain's most notorious killers during his time in the prison service, where his salary was \u00a370,000 a year, was initially sent to Winchester prison. </p> <p>But he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and is now being treated at the \u00a32,500 a week Priory hospital at Marchwood, Hampshire, where the footballers Paul Merson and Paul Gascoigne, the entertainer Michael Barrymore and the model Kate Moss have been patients in the past. </p> <p>The hospital is one of 27 specialist units operated by the privately run Priory group. Its rooms, each for a single patient, have television and video and en suite bathroom, and its 10 acres of grounds include a swimming pool. </p> <p>It treats patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including addictions, stress and obsessive compulsive disorders. </p> <p>The prison service yesterday rejected suggestions that McGuigan, who was master of a masonic lodge, was receiving preferential treatment because of his background. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said decisions on where to send sectioned prisoners were based on a prisoner's medical needs and were a matter for the NHS and the Home Office mental health unit and not for the prison service. She said a centre normally used in such cases had been full, and the cost of treatment at the private hospital was \"within the normal range\" for such cases. </p> <p>The hospital yesterday refused to comment on McGuigan's case but confirmed that the 45-bed clinic was not a secure unit. A spokesman said patients were not locked in their rooms at night, but CCTV cameras and nursing staff on hand 24 hours a day made it hard to get in and out of the clinic unobserved. </p> <p>\"The treatment regime is pretty severe,\" he added. \"All patients are assessed when they come in, and everybody is treated according to their clinical needs. They are expected to complete all their courses and will be in group or one-to-one therapy pretty much all the time.\" </p> <p>But Julie Bindel, a spokeswoman for the pressure group Justice for Women, said the decision to treat McGuigan at the clinic was a \"bloody disgrace\". She called for an inquiry into the affair. </p> <p>\"He is being treated in a privileged fashion. He should go to prison, and he should be struck off from practising medicine.\" </p> <p>This month Isle of Wight crown court was told that McGuigan first attacked his wife, Sophie, 34, when she refused to have sex with him after a night out. He broke down the bedroom door, threw her on to the bed and hit her. </p> <p>On another occasion he threw her to the ground, hit her in the face and kicked her. </p> <p>When Mrs McGuigan called police, they discovered a small arsenal of illegal weapons, including a pump-action shotgun and a sawn-off shotgun, the court heard. </p> <p>They also found a wallet embossed with the logo of the loyalist Ulster Defence Force.</p>",
  "The growing mountain of freshly-made pupils' desks and teachers' tables stacked haphazardly outside Joao Evangelino's rudimentary carpentry workshop in the town of Maliana neatly encapsulates the current state of East Timor, one year after it voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. <p>It is undeniable evidence that reconstruction in this United Nations-run territory, which was systematically destroyed by the Indonesian army and its local militias following the referendum last August 30, is at last gathering momentum and allowing the East Timorese the chance to participate in their own nation-building. But the fact that it is there at all, starting to gather dust, is undeniable evidence that there is still a long way to go before this former Portuguese colony can claim to have completed its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of last year's devastation. Just last night, UN troops and militias exchanged gunfire near Maliana. </p> <p>\"The UN says it has nowhere to put it,\" said Mr Evangelino, gesturing towards the furniture. \"They haven't decided which schools are going to reopen, let alone rebuilt them. And the school holiday ends next month.\" </p> <p>That Mr Evangelino endured a tortuous ordeal to see his workshop become a reality is a further microcosm of the nation's acute growing pains. </p> <p>\"I put in my proposal on January 1 and got the money on May 30th,\" said the mini-entrepreneur who, like thousands of East Timorese, spent weeks hiding from the militia until the UN established a presence in October. \"I was told little except that the process takes a long time and that I had to be patient.\" </p> <p>UN officials accept that reconstruction has been slow but blame the delays on factors beyond their control. \"The situation in East Timor was exceptional,\" explained the UN's transitional administrator, Sergio Vieria de Mello. \"Unlike when we arrived in Kosovo, there was nothing here. Everything had either been destroyed or stolen. We had to start from scratch.\" </p> <p>That was undoubtedly the case, but the army of foreign administrators, donors and developers went about reconstruction in the wrong way. The most prominent first signs of change visible on the streets of the capital Dili were a fleet of thousands of brand-new four-wheel-drive vehicles, a 500-room floating hotel shipped in from Singapore for the international staff, and the growing number of cafes catering to their cappuccino craving. </p> <p>These visible manifestations of the new neo-colonialism might not have been so bad if there had been decent interaction with the locals, many of whom had lost literally everything. But, for the most part, the foreigners were taught practically nothing about East Timor before arriving and when they landed they received little guidance from their superiors. </p> <p>\"I did not arrive in East Timor with a full knowledge of the situation here or the psychology of the East Timorese,\" Mr Vieira de Mello admitted. \"It took me six months to understand.\" </p> <p>As if afraid to learn or take any initiative, many UN staff drove round from meeting to meeting with their windows up, appearing not to acknowledge the destitution and suffering around them. \"After work people would not go out and speak to the East Timorese, to find out what they wanted,\" one UN staffer said. \"They went and checked their email.\" </p> <p>Compounding the problems were the over-optimistic expectations of the East Timorese. \"There was a widespread feeling that we were going to come in and solve their problems overnight,\" said Gianni Deligia, the UN district administrator in Maliana. \"The reality is that we are more a like a supermarket. We have this and that on offer and they have to choose.\" </p> <p>Crisis point came at the end of April. Demonstrations outside the headquarters of the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (Untaet) were a daily part of life in Dili. To the East Timorese it seemed as if there was lots of show but little substance. Not atypical, according to one aid worker, was an education project where \"only 18% of the budget went on pens, paper and stuff for the kids. There was so much bureaucratic waste.\" </p> <p><b> Frustration</b><br> </p> <p> Local leaders are more blunt. \"There was a sense of frustration, a lack of faith in Untaet,\" said Jose Ramos Horta, a vice president of the East Timorese political umbrella group, the National Council of East Timorese Resistance (CNRT), and a Nobel Peace Prize winner. \"[This was] because of their inability to involve the East Timorese, their inability to come forward with a roadmap, a plan. We saw time going by and no Timorese administration, no civil servants being recruited, no jobs being created.\" </p> <p>So in May Mr Horta and the CNRT president, Jose Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmao, \"did a lot of shock therapy with the UN\", Mr Horta says, and within days a difference was noticeable. In June four of the eight cabinet posts in the transitional administration were given to East Timorese and the size of the local consultation council was doubled. \"Now we are in a much more cordial, fruitful partnership between the UN and CNRT,\" Mr Horta said. \"There are less demonstrations, people are getting jobs and also enough to eat.\" </p> <p>There is also a roadmap of the path towards transition to full independence. The CNRT is currently holding its first proper congress where the goal is to empower the constituent political parties, both those that existed before Jakarta invaded in 1975 and the new ones. The first general election is timetabled for the second half of next year. </p> <p>Of much greater concern are the faltering processes of reconstruction and developing a sustainable economy. The World Bank, in charge of stimulating small and medium-sized enterprises, \"has never worked quicker in its existence since the second world war than it has here,\" according to its spokesman in Dili, Malcolm Ehrenpries. But, he adds, there are numerous hurdles still to overcome before a proper development strategy can be implemented. \"We do not even know how many people live in East Timor.\" </p> <p>The population was about 800,000 before the vote. But a proportion of these were Indonesians who left and more than 250,000 people fled or were forced into West Timor by the militias. Well over 100,000 are thought still to be in virtual imprisonment in refugee camps there. </p> <p>Coffee is the only current significant foreign currency earner - to the tune of about \u00a312m last year - although East Timor and Australia are exploring the sea between them for oil and natural gas. No one knows for certain how big a windfall might come East Timor's way; people are hoping for billions but the most realistic estimates are in the range of tens of millions of dollars a year. </p> <p>The lack of income-generating opportunities is reflected in the national budget which, for the sake of not wanting to create a massive debt burden, has been limited to a paltry $60m. </p> <p>\"We can't yet see if the economy will ever be really sustainable,\" said Arsenio Barno, the executive director of the East Timor Non-Governmental Organisation Forum. \"We're concentrating on developing the capacity of our human resources but our worry is that we will end up like Cambodia. Seven years after the UN went in the country is still very dependent on foreign aid.\" </p> <p>The struggle to create a functioning judicial system is typical of East Timor's human resources crisis, according to Mr Vieira de Mello. \"What we had here were Timorese students with law degrees from Indonesian universities, none of whom had the slightest court experience,\" he said. \"Well, we appointed them, we trained them and if you visit the Dili court you will see that we now have a credible, independent Timorese judiciary.\" </p> <p>What Mr Vieira de Mello did not say was that while the system might be functioning it is unable to cope with the flood of work and, like all facets of the embryonic administration, will take years to develop enough strength in depth. </p> <p>With the future not looking exactly rosy, most people are putting their faith in Mr Gusmao. This former resistance leader who spent seven years in Indonesian jails is by far the most popular man in the territory and is widely expected to become the first president of independent East Timor. </p> <p>\"I don't see any serious alternative candidate to Xanana becoming president,\" Mr Horta says. \"Just like with Mandela, he is an exceptional individual that everybody just follows.\" </p> <p>But Mr Gusmao is not exactly brimming with confidence about East Timor's prospects. \"It's difficult to rebuild this country,\" he said. \"We're building anew and need a new mentality to go with it. I can't tell you my priority because everything is still a priority.\"</p>",
  "A woman, her son and his girlfriend who were gunned down in cold blood outside their home may be the latest victims of \"Rolex raiders\" who target the wealthy for their watches, it emerged last night. <p>Josephina Martorana, 46, and her husband Joseph, 47, had just returned from a bank holiday shopping trip when they were attacked by gunmen on the doorstep of their detached home in Hoddesdon, Herts, at 8pm on Monday. </p> <p>The wealthy businessman, who was uninjured, was robbed of his \u00a313,000 Rolex watch in a struggle. Then his wife was shot in the back with a handgun at close range and robbed of her Rolex as she lay in a pool of blood. </p> <p>Moments later, her 18-year-old son, Stephen and his girlfriend, Isabella Agnes, 19, were also shot as they ran out of the house to investigate. All three were in a serious condition in hospital. </p> <p>The two men drove off at speed in a silver Vauxhall Vectra car, pursued by Mr Martorana in his blue BMW. </p> <p>Detectives said yesterday that the father of three managed to catch up with the robbers' car and collided with the rear of their vehicle before losing them. The robbers' car is thought to have been badly damaged in the crash. </p> <p>Police confirmed they are liaising with Scotland Yard over links with previous robberies where people were targeted for their Rolex watches. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Woods described it as a \"callous and horrific crime\". The three victims were described as critical but stable in hospital. Police officers were understood to be at their bedsides. </p> <p>Mr Woods said the theory that a \"Rolex gang\" could have been at work was being followed up by the police who are liaising with other forces, including the Met. He said: \"This is a very unusual incident to occur in this area. </p> <p>\"Stephen received a bullet wound to the chest and Isabella a bullet wound to her abdomen. They were taken to hospital and are seriously ill.\" </p> <p>The two men sped off towards Hoddesden town centre bypass. Their vehicle was rammed by Mr Martorana's BMW at Charlton Way, Hoddesden. </p> <p>Mr Woods confirmed that a handgun had been used during the incident and four shots had been fired. </p> <p>Mr Martorana is a well-known local businessman who previously ran a succesful tyre and exhaust garage. He was understood to have sold a second company, the Extreme Wheel and Tyre Centre, only last month. </p> <p>The family had lived in the road for 16 years. Two elderly relatives were also understood to live at the home. The couple's two eldest children have both left home. </p> <p>Neighbour Martin Whippy said: \"We are absolutely stunned by the news. They are a lovely close-knit family who looked after each other. Joe was the sort of guy who, if anyone threatened his family, would give chase and think about the consequences after. That's the sort of man he is. </p> <p>\"You often saw the grandparents at the house and it was obvious that they were very family orientated. They are really nice people.\" </p> <p>Mrs Martorana had twice been robbed of jewellery in London. One neighbour said: \"She loved to wear expensive jewellery, but the experience had made her think twice. I think there had also been a burglary at the house in the past.\" </p> <p>The attack has similarities with street robberies in the capital, where the wealthy and famous have been singled out for their expensive jewellery. </p> <p>In January the wife of the hairdresser Nicky Clarke was robbed at her home in St John's Wood, London. Previous victims include the late zoo owner John Aspinall and his wife Lady Sarah, Britt Ekland, Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone and chef Anton Mosimann. </p> <p>\u0095 A painter and decorator was shot dead on the doorstep of his Essex home yesterday in a gangland-style execution. </p> <p>Detectives in Essex say they have not ruled out a connection with the shooting of two doormen at a Chigwell nightclub on Monday. </p> <p>A gunman riding a motor scooter with L-plates pumped at least three bullets from a 9mm handgun into Ronald Fuller, 30, as he climbed into his white van at his home in Grays at 7.45am yesterday. </p> <p>Neighbours, alerted by his partner's screams, fought to save Mr Fuller as he lay on his driveway bleeding heavily from the head. He died before doctors had a chance to save him. Police said a man on a chrome motor scooter was seen waiting outside the house before neighbours heard the gunshots. </p> <p>Mr Fuller's partner and young son were inside the house at the time of the shooting. Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Macey said the man was found dead 10ft from his front door. </p> <p>The gunman was described as a white male of medium build, 5ft 7ins or taller with mousey hair, and wearing a long, dark coloured jacket with fluorescent flashes and a dark helmet. </p> <p>Neighbour William Yallop, who was first to the dying man, said: \"At 7.35am I heard three loud bangs and ran outside to look. The man's wife was screaming and I went to see if I could help. </p> <p>\"Then I saw him lying on his side by the car. Several people came to help but no one knew what to do and you couldn't have helped him anyway. There was a lot of blood around his head and he was unconcious but breathing. We had to just sit and wait for the ambulance.\" </p> <p>Daniel Pryke, 24, another neighbour, said: \"He was getting into his van to go to work when the gunman fired three shots. After being hit, he staggered round the back of his van but the gunman shot him again.\" </p> <p>Earlier today police confirmed that six people have been released after being questioned in relation to an incident on Monday in which two doorman were shot and injured at a nightclub at Epping Forest. One of the bouncers, who was shot in the back, has been discharged from hospital; the second has undergone stomach surgery and is in a \"comfortable\" condition. </p> <p>Mr Fuller's partner and son are now being comforted by relatives and specially trained police counsellors.</p>",
  "For the householders on Yarningale common - 40 acres of meadow, forest and scrub - life was sweet, an idyll of spectacular vistas, lazy walks and rural quiet. <p>That was until their parish council asked them each to pay up to \u00a360,000 for the right to drive up to their homes. </p> <p>Claverdon parish council in Warwickshire is demanding fees for permission to drive across the parish common up to the front doors of 17 homes, some of which are worth hundreds of thousands of pounds; already one prospective sale is said to have fallen through as a consequence. </p> <p>The parish said it wanted to \"regularise\" vehicular access, but declined to discuss the issue further; if all 17 were to pay up, Claverdon would receive \u00a3500,000, making it possibly the wealthiest parish in the country. </p> <p>Corinne Mitchell, who lives close to the common, is leading opposition to the charges, even though she is not one of those who would have to pay. </p> <p>\"What is so annoying is that everything has been done in secret,\" she said yesterday. \"If we ask questions of the parish council about the common, they refuse to answer them. </p> <p>\"My husband's family have lived in the area for 200 years, and we feel it is morally wrong and unreasonable to have our commoners' rights extinguished by the council.\" </p> <p>Yarningale common was given to the village in 1950 by Leftbridge Galton, the lord of the manor, but it was effectively taken over and managed by the council. </p> <p>Mrs Mitchell said many villagers were angry because a small section of the community was being asked to fork out vast sums to access the common. </p> <p>\"It seems so unjust and the council is being very greedy and uncooperative,\" she said. \"People are pretty mad about it.\" </p> <p>She commented that the legislation the council was using was designed to prevent people driving over common land, not to stop them getting to their homes. </p> <p>Jim Storey lives at Oak Cottage, a property that is more than 400 years old. \"I am quite sure that a horse and cart would have been allowed to come across the land without too much trouble,\" he said. \"This has suddenly been dropped on us by the council.\" </p> <p>He said another homeowner had been told that they would have to pay many thousands of pounds to access their property - which cuts across a tiny strip of the common. </p> <p>Another resident said: \"It is ridiculous that people living here who rely on access will have to pay for that privilege. When these houses were built there was no mention of having to pay to go across the common.\" </p> <p>Louise Smith and her husband, David, claimed that they had had a \u00a3500,000 offer on their property, Oaktree farm, withdrawn after a prospective buyer learned that a \u00a360,000 right of access payment was required. </p> <p>The couple had received a letter telling them that they, or the new owners, needed permission to drive up a 50 yard track that leads from the lane to their house. </p> <p>\"The issue has never been raised before and, after nine years in the house, we are stunned,\" she said. \"It would be bad enough if the demand came from a private landlord, but this is our own parish council. </p> <p>\"The council chairman, David Clark, won't discuss the policy and sends back my letters marked 'return to sender'. The solicitors just quote the law at me.\" No one at the parish council's solicitors, Edward and Harris and Son in Swansea, was available for comment yesterday. </p> <p>John Maples, Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon, said: \"It is inappropriate for any landowner to exercise his rights in this way, let alone a council which exists for the good of the people. I do see the council's position. It is being advised that it must extract best value from its assets. But the government has made it clear that this does not mean it has to squeeze the last cent. [The parish council's] refusal even to discuss the situation seems unreasonable. I do think it is being very greedy.\" </p> <p>Mr Maples is due to meet representatives of the council next month to try to resolve the problem. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said yesterday: \"Ministers have expressed sympathy. However, charging for this permission is quite legal. We are looking carefully at the complex legal issues, and will return to the subject when the countryside and rights of way bill is debated in the Lords in September.\"</p>",
  "The Basque separatist group Eta continued its bloody summer offensive yesterday with the shooting at point blank range of a young councillor who represented Spain's ruling People's party in the small Basque town of Zumarraga. <p>Manuel Indiano Azaustre, 29, was in his newsagent's shop when two hooded gunmen burst in and riddled his body with bullets. He died in hospital soon after. </p> <p>Mr Indiano is the 12th person to be killed since Eta ended a 14-month ceasefire at the start of this year and the seventh since the campaign of violence escalated in mid-July. Last April he asked for his bodyguard to be withdrawn, saying that the lack of privacy made him feel uncomfortable. His girlfriend is due to give birth to their first child. </p> <p>Eta's current offensive has also targeted Socialist politicians, members of the armed forces, police, journalists and businessmen who refused to pay Eta's so-called \"revolutionary tax\". </p> <p>The PP urged its Basque councillors to take long holidays away from the region this summer. Many have been staying with members of the party in other parts of Spain. </p> <p>Yesterday's killing came a day before Spain's interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, was due to start a round of talks with political parties on the Basque question. They may now be postponed until after Mr Indiano's funeral. The government agreed to hold bilateral meetings but it has refused to countenance all-party discussions mooted by the Basque regional government which is run by the non-violent Basque Nationalist party. </p> <p>The Basque regional president says these should be open to Eta's political wing, Herri Batasuna, while the government in Madrid insists it will only talk to parties that oppose violence unconditionally. </p> <p>Demonstrations against the killing are expected to be held throughout Spain.</p>",
  "A man is being questioned by detectives after a BMW ploughed into a group of women, killing a young teacher and a health service worker, after speeding away from a police check in a red light area. <p>A third woman, also a teacher, was critically injured in the incident which has been referred to the police complaints authority after conflicting reports over whether the car was being closely pursued by police when it lost control. </p> <p>A wreath inscribed \"Vic and Angie - thinking of you\" was left last night at the scene of the accident, a notorious blind bend by a soft drinks factory in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. A fourth woman in the group - all friends aged between 27 and 30 who had recently moved to Huddersfield - suffered minor injuries and severe shock. </p> <p>The accident happened on Monday night, minutes after the white L registration BMW 5 series had been stopped by a marked patrol car in Huddersfield, and a woman passenger had jumped out and run off. West Yorkshire police said officers had started speaking to the driver when he drove off. </p> <p>PC Dave McSweeney said: \"It wasn't a police chase.

  "<p>The government was warned last night about shambolic standards of health care provided by the NHS for more than 400,000 older people living in nursing and residential care homes. </p> <p>Vulnerable residents with complex health problems are not getting services tailored to their needs, said a report from the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Geriatrics Society. </p> <p>Most medical staff with responsibility for care homes do not have specialist training, the report said. In addition, the service from chiropodists, dentists and psychiatric nurses is inconsistent, and up to a quarter of residents are getting inappropriate medication. </p> <p>\"The transfer of long term care from hospitals to care homes has not been accompanied by significant transfer of medical resources to the community. Older people in care homes increasingly fall between primary, secondary and social care services. They are all too easily forgotten,\" the organisations said. They argued that to tackle the \"haphazard\" services for older people, NHS funding should be doubled to \u00a3800m - or more than \u00a31,800 per resident per year. </p> <p>This would be enough to provide a specialist GP service for care homes, specialist older people's nurses and \"teaching\" nursing homes in every region to develop best practice across the medical, nursing, social work and paramedical professions. </p> <p>There are 157,500 elderly people in nursing homes and 288,750 in residential care homes. Seventy per cent of care places are provided by independent and charitable organisations, though most are publicly funded. </p> <p>GPs had the principal responsibility for the medical treatment of care home residents, but they were given no encouragement to provide appropriate patterns of care, the report continued. Less than 40% of GPs had specialist training in the health and social needs of older people. </p> <p>This problem was becoming more serious, it argued, as care homes \"insidiously\" diversified beyond long term care to provide intermediate care, rehabilitation and terminal care, which require properly co-ordinated services. </p> <p>Nursing staff in homes did not have to demonstrate special knowledge about older people's needs. Scope for specialist gerontological nurses to develop an innovative approach was \"hampered by obstructive, inflexible regulation and lack of investment\". </p> <p>The report said the service from chiropodists, optometrists, dentists and community psychiatric nurses was inconsistent and sometimes cost extra. </p> <p>The report made 10 recommendations to give care home residents the same rights to health care as the rest of the population. They included individual care plans for elderly residents, similar to those for children in care, setting out their wishes, needs and expectations. Nurses specialising in the care of elderly people should be appointed in each home and local GPs should have more clearly defined roles. </p> <p>Brendan McCormack, director of the gerontological nursing programme at the RCN, said: \"We have a real opportunity to change radically the way in which we provide care for vulnerable older people. It does require substantial financial investment but we believe it would be offset by reduction of demand on other services within the NHS and would result in better quality of life for care home patients.\" </p> <p>John Hutton, the minister for social care, said much of the report was in tune with government thinking, set out in the NHS plan last month. \"The national service framework for older people, to be published in the autumn, will raise standards across the range of services for older people, including those in care homes. The national care standards commission, and the minimum standards it will set, will particularly focus on care planning issues,\" he said. </p> <p>\u0095 The government yesterday announced plans for regular testing of experienced social workers to check they still have the necessary knowledge and skills. A consultation paper on improving the quality of social care also proposed a three-year undergraduate course for entrants.</p>",
  "<p>Will Kempe was here, and so were George Bryan and Thomas Pope. Shakespeare's actor colleagues were on the Danish payroll at Kronborg Castle in the summer of 1586 and they must often have talked of their Danish experiences. Shakespeare used their tales to conflate Helsingor, the plot, and Kronborg to create Elsinore - and Hamlet. </p> <p>The National Theatre's touring Hamlet put on a performance of the play in the castle courtyard a couple of weeks ago, on a stage where the only set is a mass of moveable trunks. The Danish audience brought blankets to guard against the evening chill, reinforcing Shakespeare's suggestion that,\"The air bites shrewdly... It is a nipping and an eager air\". </p> <p>Other lines took on a new intensity within these walls: \"Denmark's a prison\" has no resonance with today's mild and benevolent democracy, but it is a different matter in a courtyard, enclosed on all four sides by palace elevations. It feels like a prison exercise yard. </p> <p>Kronborg is a giant statement of military power. It was built to dominate the Oresund Straits in order to levy customs dues, and all traffic lies under the Danish guns. On two sides of the angle overlooking the Sound are the guns, facing north and east. (\"Hamlet ends, says Martin Holmes in his study The Guns of Elsinore, 'with the crash of artillery that stood, in so many Elizabeth minds, for the armed might of Denmark'.\") </p> <p>The gun emplacements are on a terrace, and there is the \"platform\" where the action of Act 1, Scene 1and Act 1, Scenes 4-5 take place (\"upon the platform where we watch,\" says Marcellus). For the Elizabethans, \"platform\" was used to denote a gunsite. It is possible to play those early scenes on the terrace, which is what the National did. </p> <p>Although Kronborg was burned down in 1629, it was rebuilt with a virtually unchanged exterior. The inner arrangements were modifications rather than radical changes to the original. Hence, the Kronborg we see is very close to the Elsinore that Shakespeare incorporated into Hamlet, and the chambers are directly reflected in the play. The \"chapel\", to which the body of Polonius is removed, remains on view, its entrance being off the courtyard, while \"the Queen's Closet,\" as Shakespeare terms it, must be part of what are now called \"the Queen's Rooms\". </p> <p>The most striking interior feature is the Banqueting Hall, or Great Hall. This, one of the largest interiors in Europe, contains many tapestries, portraying Danish royalty, for which Kronborg was famous. Polonius, in hiding behind the \"arras\" - the word is thrice mentioned - is taking advantage of the space between the hanging screen of tapestry and the wall.Then there is the sea, just yards away from the castle. The flat shore of the Straits is not like the rock-girt coast that Horatio invokes, \"the dreadful summit of the cliff/That beetles o'er his base into the sea\". But \"the dawn, with russet mantle clad,\" really appears, so as one looks towards \"yon high eastward hill\". The Swedish coastline looks higher under the rising sun. A touch of dramatic exaggeration does not come amiss. At all events, Shakespeare depicts a view from the battlements that faces east, over the Sound. And so it does. </p> <p>Kronborg Castle is a massive stage direction that energises line after line and the National players managed to adapt a touring production to the needs of a courtyard performance. The outdoor staging picks up the atmosphere of Hamlet's \"Tis now the very witching time of night\", and when Claudius says, \"the bark is ready and the wind at help\", one senses the busy port life of Helsingor, a couple of hundred yards away. The great play has come home.</p>",
  "President Clinton arrives in Colombia today amid tight security for a visit that will underline a deepening US commitment to a messy civil war involving government forces, paramilitary death squads, leftist rebels and 90% of the world's cocaine. <p>In the first trip to the country by a US president in a decade, Mr Clinton will throw his weight behind Plan Colombia, an ambitious strategy which the Colombian government hopes will put an end to the drugs trade and bring peace after nearly 40 years of fighting. </p> <p>Visiting the capital, Bogota, was deemed too risky, so Mr Clinton will meet the Colombian president, Andres Pastrana, in the resort of Cartagena, on the Caribbean coast, guarded by 5,000 Colombian troops and 350 US agents. </p> <p>\"Colombia's success is profoundly in the interest of the United States a peaceful, democratic and economically prosperous Colombia will help promote democracy and stability throughout the hemisphere,\" Mr Clinton said earlier this month. </p> <p>Acknowledging both Colombia's strategic importance and its growing instability, Mr Clinton has supported Plan Colombia from its inception, and pledged $1.3bn (\u00a3867m) towards the scheme. But critics of the aid package fear the money will only cause the fighting to escalate, and may even spread political and drug-related violence throughout the region. </p> <p><b> Human rights</b><br> </p> <p> While some US aid will go to development programmes and an overhaul of Colombia's legal system, most will be spent on equipment and training for security forces, despite persistent concerns over the military's human rights record. </p> <p>Monitoring groups regularly accuse the Colombian army of standing by while rightwing paramilitaries massacre unarmed civilians they accuse of helping leftist rebels. </p> <p>Last week Mr Clinton waived strict human rights conditions imposed by Congress and authorised the aid package, arguing that Colombia's situation was a matter of US national security. But a White House memorandum justifying the decision acknowledged that \"there remain disturbing, credible allegations that individual Colombian military officers continue to collaborate with paramilitaries\". </p> <p>The waiver provoked criticism from human rights groups. \"It gives a clear message that from the US point of view, human rights are not important. What matters for them is the war on drugs,\" said Jorge Rojas of the Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement, a Bogota-based monitoring group. </p> <p>There are signs that US aid has already led to an escalation of Colombia's civil war. In March, the country's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) said it would step up kidnappings for ransom in order to raise funds equal to the US military aid. </p> <p>The guerrillas have also increased their attacks against isolated police stations, part of a long-term strategy to strengthen their control of rural Colombia. Although they have been involved in peace talks since last year, no ceasefire has been signed and, since January, the rebels have attacked 50 such stations. Sixty officers and dozens of civilians have been killed. </p> <p>\"Farc is accelerating its plans for territorial control, but the guerrillas are not the only ones getting stronger. State forces are improving, as are the paramilitaries. Inevitably there will be an escalation,\" said defence analyst Alfredo Rangel. </p> <p>In early August, 83 US Green Berets arrived in the country to train the second of three counter-narcotics battalions con templated in Plan Colombia. These units will lead a campaign into the rebel-dominated southern jungles of Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is made. </p> <p>\"Our aid is strictly limited to anti-narcotics activities. It is not directed towards supporting counter-insurgent operations,\" Mr Clinton told the Colombian magazine Cambio this week. But Colombian military commanders recognise that a push in the region will inevitably bring troops into combat with several thousand Farc guerrillas who protect drug installations in return for \"war taxes\". </p> <p><b> Attack</b><br> </p> <p> \"We will attack anyone in the drugs trade - Farc, paramilitaries or whoever,\" said General Mario Montoya, commander of the army's southern task force. </p> <p>It is still unclear how a military strike against drug plantations will tally with the second component of Plan Colombia: a package of social development to help wean locals from growing drug crops. </p> <p>According to Mr Pastrana, investment in education, infrastructure and services will play a key part in establishing the rule of law in the southern regions of Putumayo and Caqueta. Traditionally, Colombian governments have paid little attention to these remote Amazon regions, allowing both rebel columns and drug plantations to grow unchecked. </p> <p>In the past, Colombia has focused on spending \"to prevent drugs reaching the streets of the US, instead of investing in education, sewage systems, housing\", said Mr Pastrana. \"We want to work hand in hand with the communities, instead of concentrating on the policing aspect\". </p> <p>But funding for social development programmes remains in doubt. At a conference in Madrid last month, European countries failed to pledge the $1bn (\u00a3667m) Mr Pastrana had hoped for. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Farc is reported to be giving weapons training to peasants in Putumayo, and refugee groups fear that up to 200,000 people will flee their homes if widespread fighting breaks out. </p> <p>Neighbouring countries have expressed concern that the plan may cause Colombia's civil war to spill across its borders. Ecuador and Brazil have reinforced security along their jungle frontiers. Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, said last week that an anti-narcotics drive could threaten the stability of the entire region. </p> <p>\"How can you strengthen democracy in the midst of a war?\" said Mr Rojas. His organisation and 36 more Colombian human rights, Indian and development groups have said they will not participate in projects funded under the plan. </p> <p>Farc chiefs say Mr Clinton's approval of Plan Colombia was timed to coincide with the US election campaign.

  "<p>The Eagles sold more records and Steely Dan went down better with intellectuals, but the best American band of the 1970s was Little Feat, led by Lowell George until a year before his death in 1979. A songwriter, studio innovator, bluesman, crooner and slide guitar ace, George was one of rock's most brilliant stars. He always surpassed the supposed limitations of rock music; Jackson Browne described him as \"the Orson Welles of rock\". </p> <p>Now George is getting a memorial of sorts, in the form of a four-disc box set on Rhino records, Hotcakes &amp; Outtakes: 30 Years of Little Feat. The package is not an unmixed blessing. An entire disc is devoted to the band's mediocre post-George output, and the compilers should be lowered into boiling oil for some of the glaring omissions from the Feat's first four Warner Brothers albums. But at least the collection is a valuable reminder of George's oblique genius, with a disc of outtakes, demos and alternative versions that throw new light on George and his working methods. </p> <p>Featophiles will also be intrigued by the anecdote-crammed essay by former Rolling Stone writer Bud Scoppa. However, Scoppa strikes a bum note when he seeks to equate the present-day Feat with the original article. Today's band is \"a tribe, a touchstone, a system, a sanctuary, an ongoing act of affirmation,\" he blathers tearfully, when he must know it is only a sorry pastiche of its former glories. </p> <p>Lowell George welded a penetrating intelligence to a deadpan humour. An absurdist's view of the world is a running theme through his songs, from the dazed freaks-against-the-world saga of Strawberry Flats (from the debut album) to Rocket in My Pocket (from 1977's Time Loves a Hero). He could Lowellise other people's songs too, for example with his droll rendition of the Leiber &amp; Stoller tune Framed, or the previously unheard take of Allen Toussaint's Brickyard Blues, which is one of the great discoveries on the Rhino box. </p> <p>Writer and arranger Van Dyke Parks first met George when he was an employee at Warner Brothers and Little Feat came looking for a record deal. \"I think he had the audacity of a schizophrenic, which I associate with great work, whether it's Van Gogh or Ravel,\" Parks observes. \"I think Lowell had a madness in his work that he wanted to explore, and he had the integrity to do it.\" Parks singles out the song Fat Man in the Bathtub. \"You see the physical comedy in Lowell George that you get from Buster Keaton. It's the tragicomedy of man in crisis - that's what Lowell did for me.\" </p> <p>George's colourful background appears to have given him the confidence to pursue his particular vision, oblivious to the incomprehension of onlookers. He was steeped in Hollywood history and folklore, as anyone might be if their family home was just up the hill from Grauman's Chinese Theater. His father was a furrier who numbered many of the movieland aristocracy among his clientele, and went duck-shooting with Tinseltown veterans such as Wallace Beery and WC Fields. Although prone to weight problems, Lowell, sputtering around the Hollywood hills in a battered Morgan sports car, projected a magnetic charm that worked equally well on record companies, women and equipment suppliers. </p> <p>While his brother Hampton joined the paratroopers and went to Vietnam, Lowell studied martial arts and a variety of instruments, including the shakuhachi (a Japanese flute) and the saxophone. Another of the early rarities exhumed by Rhino is a rare and frankly dismal piece called Jazz Thing in 10, in which George tries to be Archie Shepp on sax. </p> <p>The point, however, is that behind the skewed vision of Little Feat's songs lay some unusually advanced musicianship. George served for a time with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. The first version of Little Feat - almost named Lyle Gleep - included Mothers bassist Roy Estrada alongside classically trained pianist Bill Payne, with whom George had briefly played in the Brotherhood of Man, the same place he found the Feat's long-serving drummer, Richie Hayward. The Mark 2 Little Feat, who debuted on 1973's Dixie Chicken, saw the arrival of guitarist Barrere, grandson of a famous flautist who taught at the Juilliard School in New York, plus bassist Kenny Gradney and percussionist Sam Clayton, a pair of seasoned R'n'B veterans. </p> <p>George's infuriating stubbornness was as great as his talent. His made his fellow musicians bristle by adopting Frank Zappa's autocratic bandleading style; his eccentric methods of writing and recording, meanwhile, were time-consuming and calamitously costly. The results, at least, were worth it. Rock and Roll Doctor, the opening track from 1974's Feats Don't Fail Me Now, took an age to complete because the band had to build it from a crude demo George had assembled by splicing together chunks of several different cassette tapes. George's objective was to create a song with as many awkward chord changes and rhythmic eccentricities as possible, what he liked to call the \"cracked mosaic\". Its crowning glory is George's slide guitar solo, a screaming miracle of sonic architecture. </p> <p> George's approach to his work often seemed to have more in common with jazz or classical composition: he would spend years reworking the same material, edging his way towards some imagined ideal result. The process was already evident in Little Feat's existing catalogue. The Rhino box offers several more specimens, with very early versions of The Fan, Easy to Fall (which became Easy to Slip on Sailin' Shoes), Texas Rose Cafe and a raw demo of Two Trains, featuring just George and his crude Donca Matic drum machine. It's a testament to their commercial unworldliness that the band left so many excellent tracks off their original albums. Versions of High Roller and All That You Dream from the new collection are decisively superior to the previously issued takes. Lowell's widow Elizabeth discovered the tapes of Lonesome Whistle, issued on the 1981 Hoy-Hoy! compilation, at the back of their garage in a brown paper bag. </p> <p>George was at his creative peak at a time when rock bands were still allowed to make outrageous records, and in Warner Brothers Little Feat found a label that gave its artists more creative rope than most. He also fell foul of the post-psychedelic lifestyle considered desirable in the 1970s, when etiquette dictated that one should be permanently blasted. His fondness for cocaine-and-heroin \"speedballs\" was notorious, his appetite for junk food and liquor unassuagable. An Australian journalist told me how he had interviewed Lowell over lunch in Sydney, during which George put away a bottle of Courvoisier. When he died in June 1979, aged 34, he had ballooned to an Elvis-like 22 stone and was a medical emergency waiting to happen.

  "The American \"economic miracle\" of the past eight years has been built partly at the expense of workers' rights, which are feebly enforced by the government and routinely violated by employers, according to a report published yesterday by Human Rights Watch. <p>The report says employers are taking advantage of immigrant workers, and the increasing number of part-time and contract workers produced by the new technology-driven economy, to deny employees the right to organise. Unions now represent less than 14% of the US workforce.</p> <p>One of the firms singled out for criticism is the software giant Microsoft. Of the 20,000 workers at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington state, 6,000 are not directly employed by Microsoft, but by temporary employment agencies.</p> <p>Many of these employees have worked for Microsoft for years and have come to be known as \"perma-temps\". Although they are well paid, they do not benefit from health insurance provisions, pension plans or paid holidays.</p> <p>The \"perma-temps\" formed a union, the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTech), but its recruitment efforts have been hindered by Microsoft's claim that it is not the workers' legal employer. The employment agencies say they will not negotiate with the union unless it includes other agency employees, not just those at Microsoft.</p> <p>\"We had no way of knowing who they were or how to reach them. Besides, they had nothing to do with our problems at Microsoft,\" Barbara Judd, a WashTech organiser.</p> <p>The report also discusses immigrant workers on US farms, who are threatened with investigation by immigration authorities and deportation if they try to set up a union.</p> <p>In other cases, private sector employees have been fired for attempting to form unions. Many have won court cases ordering their reinstatement and guaranteeing the right to organise, but the employers are able to prevent the rulings being enforced by appealing.</p> <p>\"Employers can resist union organising by dragging out legal proceedings for years,\" the report's author, Lance Compa, said. \"Labour law is so weak that companies often treat the minor penalties as a routine cost of doing business, not a deterrent against violations.\"</p> <p>\"The cards are stacked against workers in the United States,\" Kenneth Roth, HRW's executive director, said. \"The US government cannot effectively press another country to improve labour standards while violating them itself.\"</p>",

  "Tom Paulin is right to draw attention to racism in Ireland (Frozen out by the Irish, August 29). But his sweeping generalisations risk a different form of stereotyping. Many Irish people are active anti-racists and belong to campaigning organisations. There is widespread condemnation of racist attacks. Recent equality legislation bans racial discrimination and the new Equality Authority is charged with promoting equality objectives. To be sure there is little support here - or in Britain - for a radical equality agenda which goes beyond \"equal opportunities\" to tackle the real, structural causes of racism. But the strength of anti-racist resistance should also be acknowledged. <br> <b>John Baker</b> <br> Equality studies centre, <br> University College Dublin <br> <a href=\"mailto:John.Baker@ucd.ie\">John.Baker@ucd.ie</a> <p>\u0095 No doubt you will receive letters from my countrymen spinning the line that we are no different to the British (or any other nation). However, this is simply a denial of an uncomfortable truth, namely that in the light of the novel phenomenon of immigration into Ireland, the Irish nation has become the proverbial slave turned slave owner. </p> <p>Whereas even the tabloid press in the UK would no longer dare to follow an overtly racist agenda, the Irish press have treated immigration and race issues with an appalling slant. Reading the popular press in Ireland, the \"immigrant-as-criminal-and-social-welfare-fraudster\" has been the single most common theme in the treatment of the immigration issue.<br> <b>Stephen Lane</b><br> Clonee, Co Meath</p> <p>\u0095 On a visit to a cousin's family celebration in Dublin last October, I was taken aback by our taxi driver's vicious verbal attack on the recent influx of Kosovan refugees into Ireland.

  "I strongly support your views on the intelligence services and the public interest (Leaders, August 22). Of course you cannot have a secret service unless it is secret. But if the rule of law is to prevail, there must be circumstances in which a breach of confidence is at least excusable, if not wholly justified. If a member of the secret service were instructed to commit a crime and reported it to the police and no action was taken, surely the overriding importance of the freedom of the press should prevail and the right of the public to be informed? <p>In an address to the Dicey Conference in 1987, I referred to breach of confidence as one of the constraints on the press, but it is well established, by a number of decisions, and in particular, by the late Lord Denning, not only that exposure of \"iniquity\" justifies a breach of confidence, but that term was merely an instance of \"just cause or excuse\" for breaching confidence (Fraser v Evans 1969) \"that it would be proper to disclose a crime to the police\". That decision concerned a breach of confidence by an employee. </p> <p>To contend that a member of the secret service is barred from exposing a threat to murder a head of state against which we are not at war would be to put one part of the community above the law of the land. To conspire, however, to eliminate a head of state with whom our country is at war would seem not only to be excusable but justified. It is a terrible irony when, apparently, it is considered to be entirely excusable, if not justified, to bomb, kill and maim from the air innocent civilians who are not responsible for their country going to war, and yet to leave unharmed (as in the case of Milosevic and Hussein) the heads of state responsible for involving their citizens in military activity.<br> <b>Peter Carter-Ruck</b><br> London <a href=\"mailto:peter-carter-ruck@ dial.pipex.com\">peter-carter-ruck@ dial.pipex.com</a></p>",
  "America's longest-serving federal judge, David Edelstein, has died at the age of 90, still actively presiding over one of the Justice Department's most contentious cases - its 12-year battle to prise the Teamsters union from the hands of organised crime. <p>Earlier in his long career, the judge had set something of a world record, spending 43 years adjudicating the government's mammoth anti-trust case against IBM (the most important such action until the case against Microsoft). </p> <p>Edelstein's increasingly short fuse during the endless hearings with IBM eventually provoked the company to successfully seek his removal from the case in 1995. In its judgment, the appellate court upheld the company's complaint, ruling that it was \"manifestly clear that a reasonable observer would question the judge's impartiality\". </p> <p>The most recent example of Edelstein's robust judicial style came on June 16 this year when he was presented with the Teamsters' proposed new rules for next year's leadership elections. The government had already accepted them as sufficiently stringent to stop the widespread corruption that has characterised the union's voting for decades. </p> <p>But Judge Edelstein would have none of it. \"The submissions are a farrago of ill advice and misguided, inept, controversial and confused argots,\" he declared. \"Their programme has the potential of bringing grief, strife, controversy and corruption.\" </p> <p>He was well accustomed to controversy, which had hit him from the moment President Truman nominated him for the federal bench in 1951. Though his family was comfortably off, Edelstein had to pay his own way through college as a stock exchange page boy (where he witnessed the 1929 market crash first hand). After a period of private practice, until after the war, he eventually opted for a steady income and began climbing the department of justice ladder as attorney for various federal government departments. </p> <p>He was not Truman's first choice when a vacancy arose on the New York federal bench, and his nomination was strongly opposed by three separate bar associations. They were concerned about his lack of trial experience, but Truman's presidency was coming to a close and, amid the election fever which brought the Republican Dwight Eisenhower to the White House, the Senate confirmed Edelstein's appointment. </p> <p>The case against IBM came to his court almost as soon as he took his seat in 1952. After four years of argument, the company formally agreed to modify its business practices. However, as is usual in such cases, the details proved endlessly complicated and contentious. Time and again, year after year, IBM was brought back to court for alleged breaches of its undertakings. The paperwork eventually reached millions of pages, but Edelstein refused to let the Justice Department withdraw the case. Finally, to everyone's relief, the appeal court's ruling against him brought in another judge. </p> <p>While the IBM case was still on his calendar, Edelstein was also assigned to the government's action against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which controls much of the nation's road transport and was notorious for being in the hands of the mafia. The federal government had been trying to take effective action since the union was expelled from the main trade union federation in 1958. President Eisenhower brought in special legislation in 1959, but the mysterious disappearance (and presumed murder) of the Teamsters's president, Jimmy Hoffa, in 1975 showed that little had changed. </p> <p>The finding by a 1986 presidential commission that the union had been \"firmly under the control of organised crime since the 1950s\" finally brought charges in June 1988 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), an extremely wide-ranging law which even mafia lawyers have found difficult to circumvent. Faced with such drastic measures, the union surrendered unconditionally within months, and Judge Edelstein was appointed to supervise its electoral affairs until satisfied they were in order. </p> <p>Though initially there were significant improvements, further problems soon came to Edelstein's courtroom, including allegations of gerrymandering, corruption, and embezzlement. Once again the hearings in the case went on for years. Eventually, the judge approved the removal of the union's president (which brought Jimmy Hoffa's son James to the post) and, as his last contribution to this long-running drama, finally accepted the union's revised electoral rules. </p> <p>The Teamsters case had only come before Edelstein because he had flatly refused to retire in 1980 when he reached the customary age of 70. He knew, of course, that Article III of the constitution stipulates that federal judges \"shall hold their offices during good behaviour\" - in other words, for life. If that was the express wish of the founding fathers, Edelstein apparently reasoned, who was he to argue? </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Florence and their two sons. </p> <p><b> David Norton Edelstein, jurist, born February 16 1910; died August 19 2000 </b></p>",
  "Edith K\u00f6rner, who has died of cancer aged 79, was an influential figure in the development of the information and statistics system used by the National Health Service. Edith also played a significant role as chair of the magistrates' bench in Bristol. Edith was one of that band of remarkable people who came as refugees to this country from eastern Europe and who have contributed so much and in so many ways to its wellbeing. <p>Born in Znojmo, Czechoslovakia, the daughter of a prosperous corn miller, she arrived in the United Kingdom as a schoolgirl in 1939, alone, and never again to see her parents or 40 other relatives who perished in the Nazi extermination camps. She spoke no English but was fluent in Russian, German, Italian and French. These skills, allied with her intelligence and determination, enabled her to earn a living monitoring enemy military and civilian radio traffic; at the same time she obtained, in two years, an honours degree in economics at the London School of Economics. </p> <p>During the war, she met her husband Stephan, also from Czechoslovakia, who was doing a PhD in philosophy at Cambridge University. When the war ended, she went with him to Bristol, where he had obtained a chair at the university. There, they brought up their two children and she began her involvement in public life. </p> <p>Perhaps it was natural with her background that she should first support the weakest and most vulnerable people. In the 1950s, patients with mental illness in large institutions were the often conveniently forgotten part of the NHS. Edith realised that with modern drug treatment and support many patients could live at home or in the wider community. She exerted a crucial influence in the restructuring of this sector, showing how this might be achieved through the work she supported at the long-stay Barrow and Glenside hospitals in Bristol. </p> <p>This led to appointments in the regional health service - she became chair of the south western regional health authority in 1976 - where she established a national reputation for clear thinking, innovation and the ability to speak with knowledge on a range of issues. </p> <p>No one was surprised when she was chosen in 1980 by the then secretary of state for social services, Patrick Jenkin, to chair a full-scale review of health service information. The K\u00f6rner committee sat for four years and produced six reports, all of which were, unusually, accepted and acted upon within deadlines. It was the first major examination of the way the NHS collected and used its data and set the way forward for a comprehensive computerisation of the health system. For her work on the committee, she was awarded a CBE. </p> <p>Her energies, however, were not contained only in this field. In 1966, she was appointed a magistrate on the city bench in Bristol. Her proudest moment came when she was elected its first chairwoman. She was sharp with those who she felt did not appreciate the need to separate the judiciary from the executive as the lynchpin in our democratic government. She had experienced the breakdown of this in her childhood and was only too aware of the vigilance necessary to maintain it - and how easy it was to take it for granted. </p> <p>In support of this, she co-wrote a paper entitled Reducing Delays in Magistrates Courts: A Practical Guide. It was a sorrow to her that her suggestions were not heeded in the same way as her work for the NHS. It could have saved millions and provided for much quicker and fairer treatment of defendants. </p> <p>The leadership of this distinguished and highly intelligent woman reached its peak during the so-called \"poll tax\" disturbances. In Bristol, 20,000 people refused to pay; and in spite of the fact that her political persuasion made her equally against the tax, she chaired the majority of the hearings. </p> <p>For that we salute her, for the courage shown in her life and in the manner of her going. She and her husband chose to die together in their home. She is survived by their son and daughter. </p> <p><b> Edith K\u00f6rner, health service expert and magistrate, born July 10 1921; died August 18 2000 </b></p>",
  "<p>The music of Josef Suk is now a genuine rarity in the orchestral repertoire. Sir Charles Mackerras and the Czech Philharmonic showcased Suk's most ambitious work, the Asrael Symphony, in the first of their Edinburgh international festival concerts, but while this may have been a festival event in name, there was nothing particularly festive about a half-full Usher Hall. Maybe it is because Edinburgh is steadily emptying itself of tourists, thanks to the unsynchronised starting times of the fringe and international festivals. Even so, it is strange that the lure of Mackerras, who has been a firm favourite in festival director Brian McMaster's era, did not entice a larger audience for the adventure of the Asrael Symphony. </p> <p>Composed between 1904 and 1906, and widely considered to be Suk's masterpiece, the Asrael Symphony is dedicated to Dvorak, Suk's father-in-law, and Otylka, Suk's wife. After Dvorak's death in 1904, Suk planned a five-movement symphony and completed the work's first three movements. Tragically, Otylka died just a year later, so Suk transformed his ideas for a fast-paced finale, and composed two slow, adagio movements in her memory. The resulting symphony is, unsurprisingly, a largely gloomy meditation on death and grief. </p> <p>The work is Mahlerian in its scope and length, as well as its emphasis on musical narrative over conventional structures. The second movement is a warped recollection of happier times, a grotesquely slowed-down and fragmented folk dance. And for all the surface beauty of the orchestration of the scherzo third movement, there is a bitter, acerbic quality to Suk's melodic invention. The glorious tune in the central section of this movement is the only passage in the whole work where Suk allows himself to indulge in the tenderness of his love for Otylka. Mackerras and the Czech Philharmonic responded with playing of open-hearted warmth. </p> <p>The surrounding movements are the emotional heart of the symphony, and chart the progress of an ominous motto theme from C minor, trombone-laden darkness, to a transfigured, C major light. Mackerras and his Czech players handled this journey with immaculate dramatic timing. But somehow a sense of the emotional precipice on which Suk's Asrael Symphony is built was never fully revealed.</p>",
  "<p>So, you think that you get along well with your boss? Maybe they compliment you on a job well done, send you a birthday card or invite you to spend the weekend at their country retreat. But how much do they like you really? Think ahead, as far as 30 years. When your boss dies, will he like you enough to remember you in his will? </p> <p>It sounds highly unlikely in today's frantically insecure workplace, yet earlier this month, that is what happened to 15 long-serving employees of the late Tory MP Michael Colvin. When he and his wife died in a fire at their home, recipients of their bequests included the gardener Bernard Taylor, who received \u00a36,700, and the laundry lady, the farm manager, the butler and the butler's wife, all of whom received \u00a31,000. </p> <p>While most employers might not go quite this far, there is evidence that an increasing number of firms are keen to foster a similarly paternalistic culture of loyalty. One recent example of this came from management consultants Arthur Andersen who announced that they are to hand out \u00a310,000 \"golden hellos\" to welcome all new graduate trainees, claiming that rather than wanting to trap them into a job for life, they were doing it because they wanted to help the recruits pay off their student debts. </p> <p>Elsewhere, particularly in the City, where the dot.com brain drain is hitting staffing levels, companies are trying to hang on to people by introducing supermarket-style reward points. These are accumulated and cashed in for benefits covering everything from paid sabbaticals to in-house yoga sessions. Nowhere is this loyalty culture more evident than at the west end offices of TBWA, the advertising agency, whose clients include the Labour Party. Staff can chill out in a leisure zone equipped with two Sony Playstation pods and all the latest games, video screens and a pool table. At six o'clock every evening the reception area is transformed into a subsidised bar and twice a week there's a happy hour where all drinks are free. </p> <p>The company is one of many who now offer two \"duvet days\" a year, where workers get permission to skive off, presumably very popular on mornings after happy hour. \"People work long hours here, and we want to reward them for that,\" explains Neil Christie, chief operating officer. \"One way is by letting them have a drink at the end of the day, it's kind of like everyone meeting up in the village square. Very often staff will then go back to their desks and work several hours in the evening, so it's like a tea break with booze. We like to make our staff feel part of something, to try and give something back.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, companies are falling over themselves to remind stressed-out workers that, yes, they may be working 12-hour days, but don't think for a minute that the boss doesn't care. \"The traditional concept of the loyal, wise boss who handed down universal benefits from on high is dead,\" says Nick Page, adviser on pay and conditions for the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. \"That all disappeared during the high white-collar unemployment of the early 1980s; employees became disillusioned and more demanding. </p> <p>\"Now bosses are having to wake up to the fact that their staff are both individuals, and customers. In practice, that means companies are having to address the diversity of lifestyles among their workforce - in a creative business with a young staff, for example, it's not appropriate only to offer childcare and pension plans. By contrast, pet insurance is very popular in those types of firms - and 3% of firms we surveyed now offer that. Another way companies are trying to create loyalty is by giving something back, especially when staff work very long hours. That's why we're seeing 'concierge' benefits - grocery shopping, laundry and even on-site evening classes - becoming very popular.\" </p> <p>In the quest to nurture stressed-out employees, firms are resorting to increasingly desperate measures. Law firm Mischon de Reya experimented with a company poet. Management consultants Ernst and Young offer a confidential counselling line for staff to sort out their personal lives. Credit Suisse First Boston now offers honeymoon leave, and elsewhere in the City, Saloman Smith Barney has taken to providing gourmet meals, fresh underwear and free toothbrushes to staff working past 7pm. </p> <p>\"If you want to keep staff then you have to look after them,\" says Hilda Barrett, group human resources manager at Microsoft. \"That's why we try and create a campus atmosphere at our office. We have top quality gourmet food always available and in the evenings we even run cookery classes. Oh yes, and you also get Waitrose Direct, a grocery shopping service. Who wants to waste their spare time pushing a supermarket trolley?\" Every morning Microsoft workers are offered free fruit with breakfast, a nice touch, but one which might feel annoyingly prescriptive. At their headquarters there is an area called \"the anarchy zone\" where stressed out workers can play pool, watch a 54-inch cable TV screen, lounge around on squashy sofas, play video games, drink top quality lattes or read all the latest magazines. Despite the fact that writer Douglas Coupland branded the firm's workers Microserfs in a recent book, the staff turnover in the UK is only 8%. \"We must be doing something right,\" says Barrett. </p> <p>It's not surprising that the most far-reaching loyalty programmes are being introduced by American firms, where staff benefits are far more sophisticated. Ford provides its assembly line workers with free home computers, while it's rumoured that New York restaurants are resorting to pension plans in a bid to recruit dish washers. Recently, Seattle software company Aventail was so desperate to hire one 19-year-old graduate that it relocated two of her friends from Ohio and found them jobs too. </p> <p>As we all spend more and more of our lives at work, many employers are attempting to redress the balance by making office life more like home, often with the boss cast as surrogate parent. Business development agency The Fourth Room, for example, has offices which are designed like a house. Each morning the kitchen table is set for breakfast and a family lunch is held twice a week. British Airways' new head office near Heathrow takes the concept a stage further, featuring a Big Brother style corporate village with its own high street and TV station BA TV. More worrying still, staff are no longer known as employees but as residents. </p> <p>\"I don't think company loyalty is dead,\" says Lin Arigho, who runs design consultancy Aricot Vert. She was voted Britain's best boss in a recent competition of worker-friendly employers. \"I give people time off to go and do things that will help them to develop. One chap went off backpacking for eight weeks, another had time off for the Chelsea Flower Show. If they phone in and say they can't come in one day, they don't have to tell me the reason. I trust them. But I get it back from them in the end, because it's a case of me saving it up for later. If I need something finishing in a hurry, I know I can turn round to a person I've been very flexible with, and say, 'Now you can do this for me.'\" </p> <p>So maybe not everything about these new forward-thinking offices is perfect. \"You've got to question some of their motives,\" says Nick Page of the CIPD. \"If they're doing your shopping and laundry and dry-cleaning, and offering free drinks in the evening, the end result of all that is that you may end up working longer and longer hours with no overtime.\" </p> <p><strong> How loyal are you?</strong></p> <p><strong>Trisha King, media researcher</strong> </p> <p>I'm only here until I can get a break in the field I want. I know that and the company knows that - it even gives me time off for interviews. It's a small firm and we all get along brilliantly; there is constant banter in the office and we have regular staff nights out. I'll miss them but not enough to stick around. </p> <p><strong> Ben Andersen, urban regenerator</strong> </p> <p>I'm new to the company so my loyalty is at its all time high. At the moment it's inconceivable to see myself being tempted away. To keep up this level of loyalty the company would have to be more diverse than it is now. I can see myself moving in a couple of years' time because I want to change the field I'm in. If the company itself took that direction I would probably stay. </p> <p><strong> Elizabeth Coates, financial journalist</strong> </p> <p>I'll be loyal to this publication as long as it continues to provide me with opportunities - I don't want to get stuck in a rut. The magazine has a really good working environment, as well as an impressive reputation. I travel abroad frequently and the money's good. I wouldn't change jobs for a pay rise alone - it would have to be something which interested me. </p> <p><strong> Catherine Conway, bartender</strong> </p> <p>I'm totally loyal to the pub I work in because I'm treated well. They pay me decent money, give me lunch when I work and days off when I want, so I work hard. I used to work in a London pub owned by a big brewery. I got \u00a32.50 an hour and was treated like dirt. I couldn't have given a monkey's about them. This is a little company - we're treated well and work hard in return.</p>",
  "The economy has been growing for nigh on nine years. Unemployment is back to levels not seen for 20 years. Inflation is the lowest in the European Union. So, on the principle of \"if it ain't broke, why fix it\", Labour might be best advised to leave things on auto pilot. <p>But there are reasons for proposing a more activist approach. First, despite the improvement in Britain's economic performance relative to its main rivals, serious problems remain. Second, governments like to be seen doing things. </p> <p>The idea of Gordon Brown, of all people, sitting with his feet up at the treasury desk defies belief. </p> <p>That said, the benign state of the economy means that Labour can concentrate on big strategic questions. The government should therefore decide on overall economic aims, identify barriers to achieving them, and devise the necessary policies. </p> <p>The aims are simple. Labour should seek a higher growth rate, an improvement in the quality of public services, a more even distribution of income, a more cohesive society, and a sustainable economy. Standing in the way are entrenched pockets of deprivation, the systematic neglect of the public realm, a Byzantine tax and benefits system that discourages work and encourages cheating, a corporate elite that pays only lipservice to the notions of social responsibility, and a growth rate that has remained stubbornly at around 2%-2.5% since 1950. </p> <p>So what should the government do? At the apex of Labour's programme should be a commitment to full employment. This does not mean abandoning control of inflation but recognising that low inflation is only a means to an end. The recent comprehensive spending review said the government was committed over the next decade to getting more people into employment than ever before. </p> <p>Although this is admirable, it is not a testing target as the proportion of people employed is only one percentage point below its all-time high in 1974 of 75.7%. </p> <p>The government needs to be much more ambitious if it is to have a chance of hitting its other objective of eliminating child poverty within 20 years. It should set a full employment target of 80% of the workforce in jobs. </p> <p>Achieving this target will involve both demand and supply policies. The importance of demand - although obvious over the past 10 years - has too often been overlooked. There should be active demand-led policies in areas of particularly high unemployment - what some have called local Keynesianism. </p> <p>This would involve using the enormous purchasing power of government to favour firms in rundown areas, cuts in both taxes and national insurance for employers, and public infrastructure projects to raise the demand for labour. Having unsuccessfully tried moving people to where the jobs are, Labour should try moving the jobs where the people are. </p> <p>Next, Labour should turn the debate about public spending on its head, putting the emphasis on what is needed rather than what can be afforded. Public spending should not gyrate in response to the state of the economic cycle; if Labour believes that 10 years of 6% real increases in health and education spending are needed, it should commit itself to finding the money. </p> <p>Gerald Holtham, the former head of the left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, came up with an elegant solution - a community fund. This would be a lump sum, equivalent to the combined annual spending on health and education, invested in equities which for the past 40 years have seen an annual yield of 6%. </p> <p>The government has insisted that the \u00a322.5bn received from the auctioning of mobile phone licences should be saved rather than spent: it would be better used as the downpayment on a community fund rather than paying off the interest on the national debt. </p> <p>The rest of the fund could be provided either by skimming off the government's budget surpluses, increasing inheritance tax which has fallen drastically over the past 20 years, or by imposing a tax on land values. </p> <p>Even full employment and targeted jobs programmes will not be sufficient to eradicate poverty. Half the children in poverty live in households where the parents might expect to find work but around 1.5m do not. For them, as for pensioners living in poverty, higher living standards means higher benefits. </p> <p>All of which brings us to the unwieldy tax system, which needs to be streamlined and made more effective. One solution would be to take an axe to the number of goods and services that are either exempt from VAT or are zero rated. Making everything from food to books liable for VAT would raise close on \u00a330bn a year, and in theory it would be possible to compensate those on lower incomes for the higher cost of essential goods. </p> <p>In practice, that would prove an administrative nightmare, so Labour would be better off picking off the glaring VAT anomalies - the zero-rating of new dwellings (which costs \u00a32.7bn) and international passenger transport (\u00a31.7bn), and the exemption of rent on domestic dwellings (\u00a32.7bn), rent on commercial dwellings (\u00a31.6bn), private education (\u00a3900m), private health (\u00a3550m) and betting and gaming (\u00a3900m). Together these add up to \u00a311bn in lost revenue, most of which amounts to a subsidy to the better off. </p> <p>As for raising direct taxation, there is a strong case for abolishing the national insurance ceiling (which benefits those on more than \u00a3535 per week) and for raising the top rate of income tax to 50% for those earning more than \u00a3100,000. Such steps, however, would require some serious political spadework. </p> <p>Moving the focus of the taxation system would make Britain a better place to live. Over the longer term, taxation should be shifted from labour and on to pollution. The target should be to switch 10% of the tax burden within five years. A US-style community re-investment act, which ensures that banks cannot up and leave communities without a financial penalty, should be introduced urgently. </p> <p>Labour should push for an international agreement for a tax on financial speculation. Rather than stick to GDP per head as the yardstick of economic performance, Labour should introduce an index of sustainable economic welfare, which would measure poverty, crime and pollution as well as output. </p> <p>And so, finally, to the euro. There are many good reasons for caution - the fact that Britain would suffer from a one-size-fits-all monetary policy, the ERM experience, the problems currently being faced by Ireland, the unaccountability of the European Central Bank and its obsession with inflation, and the lack of anything approaching real economic convergence. </p> <p>Labour should also consider whether membership of the single currency is more important than its other goals. If Labour blunders into a referendum on the euro - and (as looks likely) loses it - the result will be an administration as broken as was John Major's after Black Wednesday. With William Hague and Michael Portillo waiting in the wings, it simply is not worth the risk. </p> <p><b>Pledges: </b><br></p> <p><b> 1</b> Full employment target </p> <p><b>2</b> Community re-investment act </p> <p><b> 3</b> No to the euro </p> <p><b> 4</b> Community Fund to guarantee higher spending on health and education </p> <p><b>5</b> Index of sustainable economic welfare</p>",
  "<p>Postgrad courses have expanded rapidly as students strive to distinguish themselves more in the job market and institutions are responding by increasing the range of courses they offer. </p> <p>In particular, they are offering more shorter courses, such as postgraduate diplomas and masters. These usually provide a vocational training for a specific area such as social work, law, teacher-training or arts administration, but may also be specifically academic. </p> <p>Research courses such as the MPhil or PhD are also incorporating a much greater element of training. Doing postgraduate research now is a far more comprehensive experience than it was in the past. You are unlikely to be able to concentrate exclusively on your project for two or three years, as generic training in presentation techniques and analytical and writing skills are included in your course. They can also be a requirement of successful progress. </p> <p>Training is also set to become much more focused on the individual with the development of student progress files. Part of this initiative is the personal development plan, which offers students an opportunity to identify their learning and training goals. </p> <p>Taking control of your work is crucial if you are to be successful and enjoy your study. This can be harder on shorter taught courses, as they are likely to be more intensive and with a more specific programme than research courses. </p> <p>But do not let yourself be driven by the course content alone. There may be aspects of training that are not covered by your course. If this is the case, consider how to expand your training in non-academic areas such as: computing and information technology; project management; presentation; report writing; interview skills; networking; job searching and CV writing. </p> <p>For research students the agenda is changing as well. Research councils and other funding bodies are increasingly expecting training to be more comprehensive in both academic and personal development. Even if you are not funded by a research council, and the majority of students are not, universities have significantly increased their training provision for postgraduates in recent years. Although this has clear advantages, you must be careful to manage your time effectively to ensure you keep on track with your research. It would be counterproductive to spend so much time on training and personal development that your research suffers. </p> <p>This increasing focus on training is shown by the expansion of courses such as the Research Council's graduate schools programme. This is a five-day course focusing on four areas: communication; improving your learning and performance; problem solving and working with others. It is free to all students funded by the research councils. For others it costs \u00a3450 (plus VAT) but you may be able to get your department to pay. </p> <p>Student responses to the course have included: \"It was the most constructive week of my PhD\" and \"An entirely new world of possibilities opened up to me\". With these comments the quality and breadth of the training provided by universities themselves has to be called into question. </p> <p>For an academic career, training for teaching is particularly important. For far too long universities have prioritised research over teaching despite the fact that teaching is a core function of higher education. Most postgraduates will do some teaching while they are studying. If you do, then it is the responsibility of the university to provide good training and support. Postgraduates' involvement in teaching will be adressed in more detail next week. </p> <p>If you are starting a postgraduate course in the next few weeks you need to find out what training is provided by your university. This training may be directly related to your academic work, but do not overlook opportunities for personal development. If you are starting a shorter taught course, explore other training outside your course. If you are starting a research degree, do not limit yourself to thinking exclusively about training in relation to your project. </p> <p>If you are beginning to think about postgraduate study for next year, focus on training provision when you are choosing your department and university. A good way of doing this is to find out what your current institution provides for its postgraduate students. Talk to some postgraduates and find out what they feel about their experience. How do they feel about the pressures of training while studying and how do they balance the two? </p> <p>If you are going to undertake postgraduate study, think about your motivations, your training needs and your career intentions. Don't expect your course to provide all your training needs. Your postgrad experience is far more than the course you are on and training is not just for specific skills but also for your development as an individual. Find out where you want to go and get on track with your training. </p> <p>For information on the Research Council's short courses, tel: 01223 460277 or email <a href=\"mailto:gsp@crac.org.uk\">gsp@crac.org.uk</a> Jeremy Hoad is general secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.npc.org.uk/\">National Postgraduate Committee</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The production of league tables implies the acceptance of the principle of ranking and therefore the concept of \"better\" and \"worst\". The results of ranking are very different depending on which of the many facets characterising the provision of ITT courses are selected and how these are treated. These tables focus on what are commonly perceived as the main objectives of ITT providers:</p> <p>a) to attract trainee teachers with the best possible qualifications</p> <p>b) to provide a high quality course of training and</p> <p>c) to ensure that all trainee teachers enter the teaching profession.</p> <p>The tables utilise the data gathered by the TTA and published in their annual report of performance \u00d0 the Performance Profiles. The TTA profiles include, for each provider, background and performance indicators. The background indicators include students\u00d5 statistics on gender, ethnic grouping and disabilities. The performance indicators show entry qualifications, Ofsted inspection grades and students\u00d5 employment in teaching. </p> <p>The TTA Profiles are organised by: provider and level (i.e. primary, key stage 2/3 and secondary). Performance indicators are also organised by subject with the exception of primary Ofsted inspection grades. These are given at primary level not primary subject. This type of data structure reflects the differences between primary and secondary levels and between subjects at secondary level. We have chosen to respect and preserve these distinctions partly to provide useful information for individuals who want to enter the teaching profession and also in recognition that the availability of students in some secondary level subjects, compared with other subjects, makes attempts to combine subjects misleading.</p> <p>Entry grades and employment rates are subject to further discrimination by mode of study and are provided for undergraduate and postgraduate students. The same level of discrimination is not available for Ofsted inspection grades; these tables therefore make no distinction between modes of study. Students\u00d5 entry and employment indicators are averaged across undergraduate and postgraduate provision. Key stage 2/3 courses are not included in these tables because the scale of provision is small. Subjects with less than 7 students are omitted since the small number of students would distort the results.</p> <p><strong> The Model</strong></p> <p>The description that follows shows how the data sets have been used and for what reason, thus giving the reader the means fully to understand the implications of the tables. In general, the method has been to compare an individual provider\u00d5s selected performance indicators with the optimal outcomes for those indicators in order to produce percentage scores. </p> <p><strong> Undergraduate entry qualifications</strong>. The selected performance indicator is the average A level points score, since this reflects the average standard of applicants. This is then compared with the notional maximum score achievable of 30 (3 A-levels graded A).</p> <p><strong>Postgraduate entry qualifications</strong>. The performance indicator provided in the TTA data set is the percentage of students with entry degree qualifications of 2.1 or above. No further calculation is necessary since this is already expressed as a percentage of the maximum achievable of 100% of students with a 2.1 or above.</p> <p><strong>Undergraduate and postgraduate employment rates</strong>. The number of students in teaching posts is compared with the number of students eligible for award. This is based on the assumption that students who have not been awarded a degree and those who are not in a teaching post fail the provider\u00d5s objective of full teaching employment. This needs no further transformation since it is already expressed as a percentage of the maximum achievable of 100% employment in teaching posts.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Students with unknown destinations are redistributed using the subject average employment rate (calculate as the number of students in teaching posts over the number of students eligible for award).</p> <p><strong> Ofsted inspection grades</strong>. Grades are compared with the maximum grade achievable of 1 so that a grade of 1 = 100%, 2 = 66.7% and 3 = 33.3%. They are of two types: the first 3 relate to standards while the other 2 relate to design and delivery. The standards grades are commonly accepted as the most influential set of indicators, therefore they have a higher weighting (25% each) compared to the design and delivery ones (12.5% each).</p> <p><strong>Calculating the final score</strong>. To achieve a final score for each provider at the primary level and for individual subjects at secondary level, the indicators are weighted and aggregated. The Ofsted inspection grades are identified as the most important and are therefore weighted at 60% of the final grade while the entry grades and the employment rates are each weighted at 20%.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p> With these tables we hope to provide a comprehensive yet clear indication of the \"best\" providers by level and subject. The definition of \"best\" is linked to the particular context of this analysis and therefore not absolute, but while we do recognise the different needs that an ITT course can fulfil, we want to emphasise the overarching obligation to provide the best trained and qualified teachers. These tables can be seen as both a source of information for individuals that want to enter the teaching profession and for providers to assess their level of achievement.</p>",
  "<p>Finance degrees have not taken off in the same way that accounting awards have, partly because the former possess no clear, well defined path of professional development. The latter, of course, lead to accountancy and the possibility of becoming a chartered accountant.</p> <p>Degrees with finance in the title are usually taught within business schools and the subject can often be studied as part of a wide range of business programmes. Portsmouth University's business school, for instance, offers BA accounting with finance and BA international finance and trade.</p> <p>Michael Page oversees the provision of degrees in this sphere, which all include the option of a year's work placement. This year's target intake of undergraduates is about 120, around a quarter of whom are being recruited in clearing. Professor Page says: \"Our standard entry requirement is 18 points, which falls to an average of around 12-14 in clearing. I should point out that we admit students as individuals, so whatever their exam profile is, it's still worth contacting us if a specific course appeals to them.</p> <p>While the bulk of his first degrees continue to reflect a bias towards accounting, he notes that the introduction of the BA accounting with finance has attracted a lot of students. \"It reflects a slight shift of emphasis in the marketplace. That degree gives people the possibility of careers in the City or financial services, while still holding out the traditional route into accountancy,\" he says.</p> <p>The BA accounting with finance allows holders extensive exemptions from professional accounting exams and its sandwich year can be spent abroad. On the finance side, students are required to take courses dealing with business finance, banking and financial structure, and international financial management.</p> <p>The BA international finance and trade has been running since 1995 and is designed for those aiming at careers in international financial services or with firms that control significant interests abroad. </p> <p>Prof Page says that roughly half of those graduating from Portsmouth's accounting and finance degrees eventually qualify as professional accountants. About 60% of students are male and across all courses roughly a third of undergraduates opt for the year's work placement, a proportion that has declined since the abolition of grants and the introduction of tuition fees. Most students now wish to complete their courses as quickly as possible to minimise debt.</p> <p>At Thames Valley University, finance can be taken as the minor element in a combined degree with a wide variety of other disciplines. The most popular is the BA business with finance, in which the latter counts for about a third of content. Head of accounting Paul Wilson says: \"Most students still prefer to register for accounting degrees because they ease the pathway open to professional accountancy.\"</p> <p>In clearing, a candidate aiming for the BA business with finance would generally be expected to possess at least eight points at A-level. No particular subjects are required, although applicants will be questioned on their motivation and commitment.</p> <p>Wilson explains that the finance element of the combined degree focuses on both personal and corporate aspects. \"In personal finance students will look at planning an individual's finances bearing in mind issues such as capital versus income, tax considerations, insurance and pensions. Corporate finance covers the stock market, company borrowing, treasury management and other topics.\"</p> <p>Relatively few other first degrees in the UK offer students the chance to study personal finance in such depth, yet it is a fast-growing employment sector for banks and insurance firms. Graduates often find jobs with them and also with credit card operations and pension funds. Some work as financial consultants.</p> <p>Often the key to selecting the right course in this confusing field is to rigorously assess whether the qualification will lead you in the employment direction you have in mind. Always ask any admissions tutor where recent graduates have found work and pin them down on what exemptions, if any, the award will give you in any future professional exams.</p>",
  "The campaign against grammar schools is to be relaunched this week, after the government bowed to presure to make it easier for parents to abolish the surviving 165 selective schools. <p>Campaigners in Kent, which has the largest number of grammar schools, 33, will on Friday reactivate the petitioning process they were forced to abandon this year. The government is to relax some of the technical regulations to make it easier for campaigners to collect the signatures they need to force a vote among parents. </p> <p>But the education secretary, David Blunkett, is expected to face fierce criticism of Labour's policy on grammar schools at a fringe meeting at the party conference at the end of next month. It has been accused of \"sitting on the fence\" by letting parents decide the schools' fate. </p> <p>Speakers on the highly sensitive issue will include Lord Hattersley, a former Labour deputy leader, who is still outraged over Mr Blunkett's claim this year that his \"read my lips\" comment about being opposed to selection was a joke. </p> <p>The campaign in Kent was suspended at the end of March because of \"political confusion\" over the issue, the complexity of the rules governing petitions and ballots, and a tight deadline. Campaigners needed to get 46,000 signatures of eligible parents for a vote to take place but are understood to have secured fewer than 7,000. </p> <p>Their decision came hard on the heels of a vote in Ripon, North Yorkshire, where a two-thirds majority voted to retain their grammar school - the oldest in England - in the first ballot under legislation introduced by Labour. </p> <p>Ballots are triggered by support from 20% of eligible parents. In Ripon it took campaigners six months to obtain the 1,800 signatures needed. </p> <p>In Kent the parents of all children at the 600 primary schools are eligible to vote. The Stop the 11-plus (Step) campaign will on Friday ask the Electoral Reform Society for a threshold figure for the number of signatures they need in 2000/2001. </p> <p>A Step spokesman, Martin Frey, said it had been told not to reprint the old petition forms, suggesting that changes were likely. A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment confirmed technical changes such as allowing space to include up to 10 names on a petition form, rather than only three. </p> <p>He said Mr Blunkett, in a Commons debate in June, had recognised the need for some practical changes, but there would be no amendments to the ballot system as enshrined in primary legislation. </p> <p>Mr Frey said: \"We are hoping for some meaningful changes that will make our Herculean task a little easier. Anything less than this and there will be hell for Mr Blunkett at the party conference.\" </p> <p>The selective structure in Kent was damaging standards, not raising them, he added. \"As the GCSE results showed last week, there are some comprehensives that are doing magnificently well, despite having some of the best pupils creamed off to the grammars.\" </p> <p>He pointed to little-known changes that meant the \"loss\" of around 500 places from Kent grammar schools next year. </p> <p>In addition, the 11-plus test is being changed, with a pass/fail-on-the-day format being introduced and consultation due to take place to bring it forward from January to September, when nearly all children would be only 10.</p>",
  "<p>In Britain we no longer expect to suffer from illnesses associated with malnutrition, poverty and the dark ages of medicine. But news last week that the incidence of rickets among children is increasing suggests that our confidence may have been misplaced. Dr Zulf Mughal of St Mary's hospital in Manchester believes that many cases are missed by doctors unfamiliar with a condition not routinely seen in Britain for more than 50 years. \"If you are attuned to the problem, if you walk around any area with high immigration, you often see children walking with a funny-looking gait that could well be rickets,\" he says. </p> <p>Rickets is not the only \"dead\" ailment to be undergoing a revival. </p> <p>There are 30 diseases which must be reported to the authorities under the public health (infectious dis eases) regulations of 1988: alongside cholera and the plague are conditions such as measles and rubella, which were declining thanks to immunisation. </p> <p>However, an outbreak of measles in Dublin this year showed how these \"declining\" diseases can escape medical control: two people died and 100 were hospitalised. Concerns about the safety of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine led to some parents deciding not to immunise their children and so measles returned. The World Health Organisation states that a vaccination rate of 95% is necessary to guarantee protection of the population. In Britain, the rate has fallen to 88.4%. </p> <p><strong> Rickets </strong></p> <p>\"All nutritionists learn about rickets, but it's taught that it's pretty much a Third World problem,\" says Sarah Schenker of the British Nutrition Foundation. This disorder - the result of vitamin D deficiency which causes growing bones to weaken and bend - was thought to have been eliminated in the 50s. Professor Barbara Mawer of the Manchester Royal Infirmary is one expert who has noted its return. She has seen around 30 cases in the past two years and believes that, nationally, there may be hundreds. Asian children are thought to be most at risk: vegetarian diets could be partly to blame (vitamin D occurs naturally only in animal products, although it is, by law, added to margarine), as could dress codes which hide the skin from sunlight, a crucial source of vitamin D. \"Our advice is to make sure that you get at least half an hour of daily exposure, at least on the face, hands and arms,\" says Schenker. \"It's quite worrying to think that children might not be getting even that. If we're developing into a nation that simply sits inside, it is bound to have detrimental effects.\" </p> <p><strong> Tuberculosis </strong><br> </p> <p> A survey by the public health laboratory service (PHLS) of medical professionals has placed TB fifth on the list of health priorities in the UK today, above E coli and hepatitis. \"We do see cases and the numbers are rising,\" says Marjorie Monnickendam of the PHLS. \"It became less common, so people don't think that TB could be a possible explanation of their symptoms.\" Some of these, particularly a persistent cough, can be misdiagnosed as a more common complaint, such as asthma. Between 1948 and 1987, TB cases dropped tenfold; since, the decline has stopped and numbers are rising: from 5,204 reported cases in 1990, to 6,144 last year, killing around 400. Around 70% of children are vaccinated, but in the mid-90s many escaped the needle due to a lack of BCG vaccine. As the TB bacterium can survive in the body for years before stress - caused by homelessness, age or illness, for example - activates it, a decline in vaccination levels could be just what the germ has been waiting for. </p> <p><strong> Tetanus </strong><br> </p> <p> Tetanus can never be eradicated. The only effective guard against the disease, which attacks the central nervous system causing painful muscular contractions and lockjaw, is immunisation. Tetanus jabs, along with those for diptheria, pertussis (whooping cough), polio and meningococcal type C, are given to babies from the age of two months, and are - or should be - reinforced with booster injections every 10 years. Three cases of tetanus were reported to the PHLS last year. </p> <p>Earlier this month, however, 10-year-old Tyla Green was admitted to hospital with tetanus, the first child in Britain to contract the disease for more than a decade. \"It's very rare,\" says Monnickendam. \"We don't see very many cases, and most of those tend to be in elderly people who were not vaccinated when they were younger.\" Ninety-six percent of children are now immunised thanks to widespread vaccination programmes, but then so was Tyla Green. </p> <p><strong> Diphtheria </strong><br> </p> <p> Ten years ago, in England and Wales, there were two reported cases of diphtheria, which was supposed to have been \"conquered\" after mass immunisation began 60 years ago. By last year, there were 23. Time to panic? No, says Monnickendam. \"Diphtheria is basically a throat infection, and can produce toxins which damage the heart and nerves. But many [diphtheria] bugs don't produce these toxins.\" In 1998, for example, of 23 recorded cases, 21 were non-toxic, a variant thought to account for the steady increase in cases since 1992. </p> <p><strong> Whooping cough </strong><br> </p> <p> The number of reported cases of pertussis, to give it its technical name, has fallen from 15,286 in 1990 to 1,139 last year. The fatality ratio, though, has crept up from 0.05 deaths per 100 notifications in 1990, to 0.25 per 100 by the end of the decade. So why has it become more dangerous? Monnickendam says that it is most serious under six months and most of those who die have not been immunised. Some doctors believe that official figures do not reflect the prevalence of whooping cough: one 1997 study in a large suburban practice identified enough cases to indicate a nationwide rate of 330 per 100,000 people; the official rate is fewer than four per 100,000. </p> <p>Another study in 1996 suggested that as many as two-thirds of whooping cough cases go unreported.</p>",
  "<p>Today I made the vilest error of my short-lived medical career. It's every newly qualified doctor's nightmare to hear the crash bleep go off, and to realise that the call is for a patient on the ward next door - that you will almost certainly be the first on the scene, master of ceremonies, however briefly, at the undignified prelude to an inevitable death. This afternoon, a Sunday, as I sat next to a patient (it was ward cover, and I had never seen her before) pondering where best to try and fit a cannula, I heard an almost inaudible sigh. As her posture changed almost imperceptibly, I realised that she was dying. No, she was dead. </p> <p>This is not supposed to be an earth-shattering moment for a medic. At first, it seems surprising to patients and medical students alike that anyone could die when they are surrounded by so much technology: a machine to make you breathe, a machine to clean your blood, a cupboard of drugs to sweep away the clots. I convinced myself I was managing well on my own. I did my ABC, the mantra of basic life support. The airway was clear, there was no breathing and there was no carotid pulse. She looked pretty dead to me. </p> <p>I shifted self-consciously into a managerial role, and announced, in what turned out to be rather meek English tones, \"Cardiac arrest. Crash team please.\" Nurses materialised from nowhere. \"Crash call?\" asked a nursing student by the desk. Well yes, I thought: of course I want a fucking crash call. There is a dead old lady lying here with my tourniquet round her arm. \"Yes,\" I nodded, business-like and calm, and began my chest compressions while someone fetched a bag and mask, and someone else wheeled in the resuscitation trolley. </p> <p>I heard the call going out on my own bleep. Within 90 seconds, doctors began to trickle in. I had been eyeballing the defibrillator, wondering if I could really trust myself to use it. They were sweaty but experienced, they were the cavalry, and immediately they asked for the notes and the story. I had been with the patient for 10 minutes, long enough to know she needed an IV line, long enough to know from the notes what had happened to her over the past six weeks. I laid out the story and the notes sat on her bedside chair. </p> <p>Did I mention the relatives? I had forgotten they were there, although it was hard for them not to notice us. This was the moment their loved one passed away, far away from everything that that been her life. I, on the other hand, had a patient, and a list of things to do. The curtains were pulled, and the chest inflations didn't seem to be doing much. The senior house officer hurriedly manoeuvred a plastic tube down her throat. </p> <p>There was no pulse, and there was \"no reversible cause\". The defibrillator electrodes were on, and the monitor showed ventricular fibrillation. \"VF is the commonest pulseless electrical activity,\" I thought, inanely, \"and the one that is most frequently shockable.\" A line was placed in both arms, the anaesthetist began struggling to get one into her neck. I allowed myself to be sidelined. </p> <p>\"OK, I'm ready to shock. All clear.\" It is the responsibility of the person who administers the shock to ensure everyone is clear, the voice of ancient revision recited in my ear. The patient was very clearly very dead ... 200 volts, and she arched into the air. Check: no pulse, no change, VF ... 200 volts, no pulse, no change, except this time a wheeze as the air was forced out of her chest ... 360 volts. </p> <p>Perhaps I'm not explaining myself properly. What I was watching was horrific: wires in her neck, tubes in her throat, spasms of electrocution. It may even have been painful. It certainly sounded like it from the cracking ribs. It was undignified, and traumatic, and the routine cycled around for what felt like an hour. </p> <p>Registrars come to arrests to tell you when to stop. Ours came and took one look at the notes, one little look, at the \"Not for resuscitation\" pink form, ticked, signed, dated, six weeks before, reviewed every week, a form marked: \"Not for resuscitation: on grounds of futility, on grounds of quality of life.\" </p> <p>Ticked. But not noticed by me. Discussed with nurses, discussed with medical staff, discussed with patient, discussed with relatives, every single one was ticked. So there I stood, thinking: am I guilty of assault, or abuse of a corpse? Was it a crime against this woman, or her family? Was it my fault? Obviously. </p> <p>I knew nothing of this woman's life. I just marched in at the end with the fireworks, at the most personal moment of her lifetime. \"If there is any doubt about resuscitation status, you must always put out a crash call.\" I don't care. This is the worst thing I have ever done.</p>",
  "The government is facing an embarrassing double setback to its plans to suppress intelligence reports in the case of Paul and John Grecian, former directors of Ordtec, who were prosecuted for illegally selling military equipment to President Saddam Hussein. <p>The two men are suing customs and excise for millions of pounds in damages for malicious prosecution after the appeal court overturned the conviction of Paul Grecian and charges against his father, John, were dropped during plea bargaining. </p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, was accused of hypocrisy when he used gagging orders - public interest immunity certificates (PIIs) - to suppress the texts of four intelligence reports. While in opposition he lambasted the Tories for signing such orders, which led to Paul Grecian's imprisonment in the first place. </p> <p>Although Mr Cook has said that the sole reason for withholding the documents was to protect their sources, he refused to hand them over with the names of sources blanked out. </p> <p>His decision is backed by Jack Straw the home secretary, who has forbidden the Grecians access to further intelligence reports in the case. </p> <p>Now two developments threaten to undermine the government's case. Article 8 of the new Human Rights Act which comes into force on October 2, and a ruling from Elizabeth France, the data protection commissioner, giving the public the right to ask to see security files on them, will let the Grecians' lawyers ask for seek these and any other documents held by the security services relating to the father and son. </p> <p>A law lords' ruling on July 27 will also weaken customs and excise ability to mounta successful defence against the Grecians. </p> <p>It let four people, led by David Darker, prosecute the West Midlands police for conspiring to fabricate evidence against them. The Grecians' lawyers will use it to apply to the courts in November for permission to bring accusations of abuse of power against customs and excise. Such allegations only require proof of malice: the absence of an honest belief in guilt is not necessary. </p> <p>The West Midlands police claimed immunity from prosecution after the trial of Mr Darker and three others for alleged drug trafficking and forgery of travellers' cheques collapsed because evidence had been fabricated by the police. </p> <p>The case went to law lords, who ruled that because the police fabricated the evidence, immunity from prosecution should be withdrawn. </p> <p>The five judges ruled that \"in determining the scope of witness immunity, the predominant requirement of public policy was that those who suffered a wrong should have a right to a remedy\" and it should not extend to the \"wrongful purpose of fabricating false evidence which would be referred to in an untruthful statement of evidence\". </p> <p>Lord Hutton quoted Sir Richard Scott, the judge who headed the Arms to Iraq inquiry, as saying \"The police and the crown prosecution service, like everyone else, are subject in the discharge of their duties to the rule of law. There is no public interest that requires them to afforded immunity against actions based on malicious or knowing abuses of their powers.\" </p> <p>Lawrence Kormornick of Dechert, the Grecians' lawyer, said: \"The Darker case is an important landmark human rights decision that apart from evidence in court and witness statements, the police and other investigation authorities and prosecution authorities no longer have absolute immunity from suit for actions alleging conspiracy to injure and misfeasance in public office. </p> <p>\"The House of Lords now seems to be saying that investigators and prosecutors like everyone else, are subject to the rule of law and they should not have immunity against actions based on malicious or knowing abuses of their powers unless absolutely necessary. </p> <p>\"This decision is to be welcomed, it should enable many more victims of injustice to obtain compensation by relying on abuse of public office rather than having to prove malicious prosecution.\"</p>",
  "Feuding loyalist paramilitaries who shot a schoolgirl in the back were trying to wipe out her family, it was claimed today. <p>As detectives questioned three men about the wounding of 11-year-old Charlene Daly in Coleraine, Co Londonderry, gunmen belonging to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were also accused of attempting to shoot her parents and younger sister. </p> <p>Charlene became the youngest victim in the worsening feud between the UVF and rival Ulster Defence Association, which has already left three men dead and dozens of families forced to flee their homes in Belfast. </p> <p>The front of the house was sprayed with gunfire as she sat in a downstairs living room watching television late last night with her parents, Frankie and Yvonne, and younger sister Coleen. </p> <p>The girl was described as \"ill but stable\" in the intensive care unit at Coleraine hospital, where she has a bullet lodged in her back. Bullets also struck the Coleen's top bunk in an upstairs bedroom. </p> <p>Family friend Billy McFarlane said: \"This wasn't just an attempt to scare somebody, it was an attempt to take out the complete family. The gunmen - and they were obviously local people - knew the exact layout of the house and they fired head-high, riddling the place.\"</p> <p>Mr Daly, a former loyalist prisoner, managed to pull the younger girl to the floor to escape the gunfire, but was unable to prevent Charlene being hit. </p> <p>East Londonderry Ulster Unionist MP William Ross, whose constituency includes Coleraine, said: \"Heaven knows where and when this absolute madness, this butchery, is all going to end\u0085 Far too many lives have been lost in this vendetta, but it seems to be spreading and looking to end in more deaths.\"</p> <p>The attack was the third in as many days involving rival factions in Coleraine's Ballysally estate. The house was hit 19 times by a burst of automatic gunfire. </p> <p>A red Vauxhall Astra car found abandoned close to the Ballysally roundabout was believed to have been used by the gunmen. </p> <p>Mr McFarlane, a member of the UDA's political wing, the Ulster Democratic party, said: \"If Charlene's sister had been in bed at the time, she would be dead today. This wasn't just a case of a car passing by and some letting off a few shots. Most of the fire was concentrated on the living room, where they knew there would be adults, and then they also shot up the girls' bedroom. It was attempted mass murder.\" </p> <p>Community workers are involved in attempts to try to get the two sides to call a truce. But this shooting - just hours after the home of one of the three recent murder victims was badly damaged in a fire in north Belfast - is bound to heighten tensions there and on Northern Ireland's north coast, the area worst affected by the feud outside the city. </p> <p>Police and military patrols have been stepped up in a bid to stop the violence.</p>",
  "The revelation that BSE and its human form may be able to jump the species barrier and be highly infective even when a person or animal with the disease shows no signs of it, appears to confirm some of the worst fears scientists have about the fatal condition. <p>The disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, has already caused a cattle epidemic costing more than \u00a34bn, and its human toll of 73 deaths so far - all except three being Britons - is climbing steadily. Its eventual impact on the health of the human population and the cost to the NHS, is almost impossible to measure. Yet when the cattle disease first emerged in 1986, government advisers dismissed any threat to people. </p> <p>Now Europe quakes. Scientists believe that countries, such as Germany, which profess not to have BSE, are likely to have some cattle suffering from it even if the disease has not yet taken sufficient hold for it to be obvious. The first known case of BSE, in a cow on a farm in Pitsham, Sussex, occured in December 1984, almost two years before the disease was identified. In fact, the illness may have begun to set in during the early 1970s, but at such a low level that vets and farmers did not recognise it as a new disease. </p> <p>Feeding practices, in dairy farms particularly, where cows' diets included the groundre mains of other cattle and sheep, probably sent the disease into its catastrophic spiral. Even now cases in Britain far outstrip those anywhere else. There have been more than 177,000 cases, nearly 780 confirmed so far this year. By contrast, Ireland has had a total of 489 BSE cases, Portugal nearly 350 and Switzerland 365. </p> <p>France, with whom the beef war drags on, has had just over 100 cases, with 28 this year. There have also been two cases of human BSE in that country and one in Ireland. </p> <p>There have been numerous forecasts about the eventual human death toll. Some estimates, putting it at less than 100, already look too optimistic. Others have judged it be hundreds of thousands. Oxford statisticians earlier this month painted a worst case scenario of 136,000. </p> <p>After years in which warnings of death through eating infected meat met public scorn, in March 1995 the fatalities began. But it was March 1996 before scientists made the first connection. The first victim to die was Stephen Churchill, aged 19, though the first person to show symptoms is thought to have been a 50-year-old, in January 1994. </p> <p>Even now it is thought victims are most likely to have been infected by exposure to cheap meat-cuts from highly infective parts of cattle before the first anti-BSE controls to protect human health were in troduced in 1989. The agriculture minister, John MacGregor, banned the use of certain offal in food against the earlier advice of civil servants. </p> <p>Even though the ban was not as rigorously observed as it should have been over the next six years, the measure probably stopped the collapse of the beef and dairy industries in 1996 when the link to human deaths was made, and reduced the prospects of a far worse human death toll from infected beef when BSE was at its height in the early 1990s. Other measures have been added, including from December 1997, for two years, a ban on selling beef on the bone. </p> <p>Measures to stop humans spreading the disease have included changes to blood transfusions, the use of more disposable equipment and more rigorous sterilisation. </p> <p>The problem for the government, even after the new findings suggesting human BSE might be spread more easily than had been assumed, is deciding just how much should be spent on seeking to prevent an unquantified risk. </p> <p>The latest research means the assumptions - that a species barrier between humans and the animals they eat would cut the number of people who might succumb to BSE, and that there might have to be a high dose of infective material to induce the disease - must be re-addressed. Cows appearing healthy may also be capable of infecting people more easily than had been supposed. So scientists will have to consider whether they are removing enough offal from the food chain and whether barring cattle over 30 months for sale is sufficient. Cattle far younger than 30 months have displayed BSE signs - although not since 1996 - and the 30-month rule does not apply in many other countries that have BSE. </p> <p>European-wide offal bans are only just being introduced, and scientists have suggested that just one cow slipping through the net could infect up to 500,000 people. </p> <p>There is also the suggestion that transmission of BSE-like diseases through different species may create new, more virulent strains. Some scientists believe that scrapie, a BSE-like disease in sheep not known to be harmful to humans, is now disguising the BSE agent that has entered sheep through animal feed and been recycled through the generations. Scrapie-infected sheep brains are being tested with mice in the laboratories. Last month, the food standards agency suggested such a BSE-like strain might be identified \"at any moment\". </p> <p>Contingency plans , including altering slaughterhouse and butchery practices, are already being prepared to try to avert another food panic. Britain does not routinely test for BSE in cattle planned for human food. And, unlike other countries, the UK does not destroy all the animals of a herd when a BSE case is identified. </p> <p>Millions of cows over 30 months old have been destroyed under compensation schemes, and there is a suspicion that this has made it look as if BSE is dying out faster than it really is. </p> <p>The recent research suggests cattle can harbour the disease it without showing outward signs of it. Random tests on 3,000 cows last year revealed 18 had BSE without showing clinical symptoms. Such checks will be increased to 10,000 this year and there will be surveys on 3,000 animals which die unexpectedly on farms or have to be slaughtered through illness or injury. </p> <p>But ministers will have to consider whether also to check animals going into the food chain. That could improve consumer confidence - but not if the monitoring shows BSE is more widespread. </p> <p>The government plans to follow France and Switzerland by introducing rapid cattle post mortem examinations from January with results in one to two days. </p> <p>The problem is whether these will be sensitive enough to detect BSE in its early stages. Such measures would assume that the eating of infected meat has been the cause of variant CJD. </p> <p>But billions of pounds-worth of preventative measures are already in place. And the question remains, how much more needs to be spent?</p>",
  "Scientists are to re-examine controls against variant CJD, the deadly human form of BSE, in the wake of evidence that the disease might be highly infectious even when unwitting carriers do not display outward signs of suffering from the condition. <p>They will also determine whether a new system of checks on sheep, pigs and chicken is needed to ensure that recently banned farming methods have not created other potentially fatal routes for BSE to enter humans. </p> <p>New research has raised fears that animals thought to be healthy and incapable of acquiring BSE could in theory pass the disease on. The results have also renewed concerns that humans not displaying vCJD symptoms but incubating the condition may infect others undergoing medical or dental procedures. </p> <p>Experiments on mice and hamsters have suggested that similar diseases could jump between species more easily than had been supposed and spread within species even when obvious symptoms are not yet evident. </p> <p>Although scientists in the field of BSE research have suspected this, Professor John Collinge, who headed the research funded by the medical research council, said its results could have important public health implications. </p> <p>The latest developments come amid signs that the incidence of vCJD is growing at between 20% and 30% a year. In Britain, 70 people have died and nine others are still alive suffering the always fatal condition. There have been two deaths in France and one in Ireland. All are thought to have been infected years ago through exposure to cheap meat from parts of cattle containing high concentrations of the agent responsible. </p> <p>Since 1989, the government has introduced a series of controls including a ban on certain offals entering food, a bar on all cattle over 30 months old being used for food, and an end to feeding cow and sheep remains to other meat-producing livestock. </p> <p>Anti-vCJD measures to lower the risk of spread between humans have included tighter restrictions on blood transfusions, more use of disposable surgical instruments and better sterilisation of other equipment. </p> <p>BSE-like diseases are believed to be caused by abnormal proteins, called prions, taking hold in previously healthy parts of the body's central nervous system. But \"species barriers\" between types of animal were believed to reduce the apparent potency. There was thought to be a high one between hamsters and mice. </p> <p>Prof Collinge's team, based at the MSC's prion unit and the Imperial College school of medicine at St Mary's Hospital, London, found that mice injected in the brain with hamster scrapie, a BSE-like disease, carried high levels of infectivity while living into old age and showing no outward signs. But when material from the brains of these mice was injected into other mice and hamsters, it eventually killed them. The suspicion is that the process created a new strain, or strains, of more virulent disease. </p> <p>The findings, published last night in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, will cause concern that contaminated material from people not displaying vCJD symptoms but incubating the condition may infect others undergoing medical or dental procedures through the use of contaminated instruments. </p> <p>Present sterilisation and cleaning techniques cannot remove all traces of the vCJD agent, although experts say they can substantially reduce levels of infectiousness. </p> <p>The new research will also reinforce suspicions that far more cattle have been infected than has been obvious and that scrapie in sheep, never known to have been harmful to humans, may have changed into a more dangerous strain by passing through cattle and back to sheep in the years when cannibalistic feeding practices were commonplace. </p> <p>So far BSE has not been known to have transferred to sheep or pigs outside the laboratory, but there are likely to be renewed calls for spot checks on healthy animals to see if their brains contain signs of the disease. </p> <p>Prof Collinge said: \"I don't want to raise alarms that that is likely, but we could check that quite easily so why don't we? We don't want to find this out later.\" </p> <p>He is a member of the government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (Seac) which will consider the implications of the finding at the end of September. He does not think other new controls to stop infection from \"hidden BSE\" in cattle will be necessary, but he is \"not sure\". He said: \"My own view is that probably the 30-month rule and the offal ban would still protect us from that but I am not sure. This data shakes me up a bit.\" </p> <p>Professor Peter Smith, acting chairman of Seac, said the findings were of \"considerable interest\" but it was not clear that they indicated additional controls were needed. </p> <p>The Department of Health said: \"Current measures to protect public health from farm to healthcare were introduced on the basis that infection in animals and in people may be present in the absence of clinical diseases.\" </p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture said: \"We believe the safeguards in place at the moment are adequate to deal with the issues Prof Collinge raises, but of course we will listen to what he has to say.\" </p> <p>Frances Hall, secretary of the Human BSE Foundation, whose son Peter died from variant CJD in 1996, said: \"We have always been worried that BSE might be in animals that aren't showing any symptoms. Subclinical animals can look perfectly fine, as can victims of human BSE before they get unwell.\" </p> <p>\u0095 French officials have discovered three new cases of mad cow disease, the country's agriculture ministry said in a statement yesterday.</p>",
  "The cobbles and terraced houses of Coronation Street - one of the most popular soap operas in Britain - were the backdrop for a series of gay \"weddings\" at the weekend. <p>Gay couples who wished to celebrate, affirm and symbolise their relationships chose to do so at the Granada studio set in Manchester during GayFest 2000.

  "An MP today warned of escalating terror after a schoolgirl became the youngest victim of the vicious loyalist paramilitary feud in Northern Ireland. <p>Detectives questioned three men about the shooting in Coleraine, Co Londonderry where Charlene Daly, aged 11, was hit and seriously injured.

Upstairs and downstairs windows were shattered at the girl's home at Jefferson Park which was hit 19 times in a burst of automatic gunfire. A red Vauxhall Astra car found abandoned in a farmhouse lane close to the Ballysally roundabout is believed to have been used by the gunman. </p> <p>Community workers are involved in attempts to try to get the two sides to call a truce, but this shooting - just hours after the home of one of the three murder victims was badly damaged in a fire in north Belfast - is bound to heighten tensions there and on the north coast, the area worst affected by the feud outside the city.

  "<p>Public opinion has been moving against support for United Kingdom membership of the single currency for some months but attitudes are not as clear cut as they might appear. Many people are having difficulty making up their minds. </p> <p>A Gallup poll in July found that 21% thought the UK should join, 38% that it should stay out, but 41% opted for wait and see; the rest did not know. It is those who want to wait and see who are going to decide the referendum when it is finally held. </p> <p>Political scientists have shown that voters seek to verify the messages they receive. They are not inclined to accept things at face value and either use their personal experience to check or listen to opinions they trust. These may belong to someone they know personally or a political leader, newspaper or commentator. The reason why New Labour got into trouble over its claim to be spending large amounts on public services was that people could not verify the claim from their own experience. The observed reality of long hospital waiting times and over-crowded classrooms did not square with the hype so voters ended up by not believing the messenger. </p> <p>Voters have difficulty with the euro debate precisely because there is no clear means of verifying the claim that joining will improve things or the counter-claim that joining will make things worse. Personal experience is not much of a guide, although earlier this year many took the falling euro exchange rate as an indicator that the experiment was failing. It is hard to get independent advice from experts who people can trust because so many of them disagree. This is why so many people are sitting on the fence. </p> <p>So how likely is the public to take advice from the newspapers it reads? Does the press play a decisive role in influencing public opinion on this issue? The chart shows some interesting variations in newspaper readers' opinions. </p> <p>Attitudes and readership are clearly linked. To judge from its editorials and the way it presents the news, the most Eurosceptic paper is the Sun. And a clear majority of its readers want the UK to stay out of the euro. Among the least Eurosceptic of the metropolitan papers in its coverage and editorial line is the Guardian, with a major ity of its readers favouring UK membership. (Readers of the Independent, perhaps more enthusiastic than the Guardian, are less keen on joining, 37% saying join now, 19% not at all and 41% wait and see.) </p> <p>These associations could be explained either by readers' accepting their papers' editorial line or because they select papers which share their views. Thus the well-known Euroscepticism of the Murdoch press might explain the attitudes of Sun readers. But how then to explain why the Times's readership is much less Eurosceptic than the Sun's, even though the Murdoch flagship hardly espouses Euro-enthusiasm in its news or leader columns. Some 26% of readers of the Daily Telegraph favour joining and a further 40% say wait and see: so while the paper has strongly supported William Hague's Euroscepticism, two-thirds of its readers either in favour or are sitting on the fence. As for the Guardian its editorial view on joining is not clear yet its readers definitely favour membership. </p> <p>One underlying factor is social class. Some 25% of the middle class favour joining and 29% oppose. In contrast only 16% of the working class favour joining and 44% oppose. Thus the reason why Times and Daily Telegraph readers are less Eurosceptic than Sun readers is because they are more middle class. However, this is not the whole story because Sun readers and Daily Mirror readers have rather different attitudes, even though their class profiles are very similar. Some 27% of Mirror readers want to join and 38% say wait and see; only 32% are opposed to joining. </p> <p>There is a big educational gap in attitudes. Only 13% of individuals who left school at 16 favour membership, while no less than 41% of individuals who have gone through higher education are in this group. There is even a modest gender gap with 25% of men favouring membership and 19% of women. Clearly a number of other things explain attitudes on this issue in addition to newspaper readership and most of them relate to the individual's social status. The most secure, prosperous individuals favour membership and the least secure oppose it. </p> <p>Overall, the evidence suggests that because most people are sitting on the fence or don't know what to think, the campaign will decide the outcome of the referendum. It is likely that editorials will influence some voters once the campaign gets under way, but it is easy to exaggerate their importance. What is perhaps more important is the leadership shown by prominent individuals who have the trust of the voters and in this respect New Labour has lost a lot of ground in the credibility stakes over the last year. If Tony Blair is to give a lead on this issue, he has to hope that the general election will restore some of this credibility before the referendum campaign starts. </p> <p>Perhaps the most intriguing point is that class politics is alive and well and can be found in the debate about UK membership of the euro. If marked differences in attitude between the social classes are not addressed in the referendum campaign, then supporters of UK membership are going to have a tough time winning the argument. </p> <p>Paul Whiteley is director of the Economic and Social Research Council programme on democracy and participation.<br>P.Whiteley@sheffield.ac.uk</p>",
  "<p>Boys have become the weaker sex in education. Finally something is being done about it.\" No, not our boys - this is a headline from the Sydney Morning Herald in April 1994. In Australia, boy trouble has been on the political agenda rather longer than it has here and an Australian government report - the culmination of years of research into the educational performance of girls and boys - was published there last week. </p> <p>Its recommendations do not include all-boy classes or more male teachers, two of the approaches David Blunkett has suggested. Professor Jane Kenway, joint author of the report, explains: \"Sticking blokes in front of the class? I don't think so. Which blokes, modelling what kind of behaviour? There is no evidence to sustain these ideas. We searched the literature for anything relevant to this debate. We had access to everything. If such evidence existed, we would have got it.\" </p> <p>Indeed, in earlier research Kenway found that macho male teachers can exacerbate the problem of \"laddish\" behaviour that commonly goes alongside under-achievement, particularly in all-boy classes. Maritin Mac An Ghaill, researching schools in this country, endorses this. He found that boys who were academically successful were often seen as effeminate by macho teachers as well as pupils - hardly what we would be looking for in challenging the \"lad\" culture. </p> <p>As for all-male classes, Kenway found that \"students and teacher can enjoy being sexist and uncouth with impunity. Single sex provides new opportunities for old-style masculinity, for male bravado and bonding... in terms of gender reform, such classes are bad news.\" </p> <p>Experiments in single-sex classes have already gone ahead in some schools in the wake of the last wave of ministerial enthusiasm. Amanda Barton, from Manchester University, has studied some of them. She found no clear-cut evidence, for or against, but warned that \"though some single-sex classes worked well, in some cases they were disastrous. The worst cases were in large mixed-ability classes where there was absolute chaos. It worked best when pupils were set by ability in small classes and where schools are able to pair teachers and classes very carefully. If the teachers aren't comfortable with it, it is doomed.\" </p> <p>And there, of course, is the rub. Good schools are good because they have good teachers who have high expectations of their pupils and enthusiastic heads who involve staff in creating change, so that they feel motivated rather than imposed upon. If a move to single-sex classes was imposed from above, particularly on reluctant staff and students, it would be counter-productive. </p> <p>The Australian research avoids such simplistic responses. It is primarily concerned with two issues. The first is to recognise which children are failing and target them. The second is to \"develop programmes that encourage boys and girls to move towards positive and flexible gender identities and peer cultures\". Or, as Kenway herself puts it: \"What is required is a curriculum designed to encourage boys to understand different ways of being male. There is an absolute necessity for challenges to the peer culture of boys.\" </p> <p>Ann Phoenix, a professor at the Open University, has just completed a study of boys' attitudes to work. She agrees with Kenway. \"You can't intervene without involving young people. They are not passive, you can't just do things to them. You have to understand the place of laddish culture in boys' lives, work with them, take them seriously.\" </p> <p>Getting young people to take control of changing their own lives is a much slower business than sending out government decrees, but it works at a deeper level. The change in girls' academic success did not occur because the government ordered a move to single-sex schooling (even though it was often advocated). Certainly there were curriculum changes, but the real change occurred when girls began to internalise the idea that it was okay to be female and to be independent. For girls to be able to reject the cultural notion that clever girls couldn't be sexy was a huge step. Surely it must be possible for boys to make a similar cultural leap? </p> <p>A number of small-scale programmes aimed at challenging the \"lads don't work\" attitude are already being implemented in our schools. What they have found is that getting boys to talk about their behaviour is not as hard as it might appear. The first step is to find a strategy that avoids getting too personal - at least to start with. It often helps to begin by surveying the opinion of the children themselves. They usually know just what the problem is and, under cover of something as neutral as an anonymous survey, will be happy to say so. </p> <p>I devised a programme for a school in London that involved surveying year 9 for the reasons why they thought boys were not doing as well as girls. More than half the boys agreed with the statement; \"boys who try hard get laughed at\" and over 90% agreed that they would do as well as the girls if they tried as hard. Armed with an analysis of their opinions, we were then able to break the classes up into single-sex groups and get them to talk about why boys in general (we avoided personalising as much as possible) behaved that way and what they could do to make changes. The experience was noisy and challenging but ultimately illuminating for all. For the first time these boys were talking in public about the ways in which they policed each others' behaviour - collectively depressing achievement. And how they could use the things they are good at (team work in particular) to help each other do better. </p> <p>Tony Sewell at Leeds University organised a similar programme aimed at under-achieving black children (mainly boys). He also started by asking them why they were not performing well. Nine out of 10 saw the major barrier as \"peer group pressure\". They couldn't reconcile the need to do well at school with the need to be accepted by a culture which insists that only nerdy white people work hard. This was the only part of the research that got reported in the press, but it is what happened next that matters. Taking their own estimation of the reasons for their under-achievement as a starting point, Sewell devised a 10-week programme that was then implemented by teachers. </p> <p>It aimed specifically at challenging anti-school attitudes and included sessions on conflict management, social skills, peer group pressures and a critical look at the way in which consumer culture has made use of the \"hard\" image of black youth to sell products such as trainers. He was asking these children to question the way in which the image of black masculinity, which they look up to, could be undermining them. Their progress was measured against a control group in which there was no intervention. The improvement of those taking the programme was striking and is now to be implemented in mixed-race groups in a number of other schools. </p> <p>Alongside such \"consciousness raising\", activities that encourage maturity in boys can be very effective. One of the things most of those working with boys have commented on is the way in which boys' playing about, even in secondary schools, disrupts their own work and that of the class. Unfortunately, infantile behaviour tends to elicit parental-type behaviour in response and boys get locked into a cycle in which they are never asked to behave in a responsible way because they never demonstrate that they can be responsible. </p> <p>Carol Fitz-Gibbon of Durham University set out to intervene in this cycle, with a technique she calls cross-age tutoring. In this, 14-year-olds in danger of dropping out were asked to teach nine-year-olds about, say, fractions. The evidence showed that both age groups benefited. Colin Noble, co-author of Getting it Right for Boys and Girls (Routledge 2000) is enthusiastic about this approach. \"We expect immature behaviour from boys and they behave immaturely. We need to give boys more responsibility - it has fantastic results in terms of behaviour and academic results.\" </p> <p>Whatever action is taken to improve boys' performance, we must remember that boys hear the news, too. According to Ann Phoenix, they deeply resent the way in which the media constructs them as failures. We should beware of a rather unsettling finding from the Australian research: the region with the biggest gap between girls' and boys' attainment is New South Wales, which is also where there has been the most heated debate about boys' achievements. According to the report, \"New South Wales male students are starting to believe the popular press rhetoric about their own lesser competence.\" </p> <p>Are we in danger of fatally undermining boys' confidence by the way we talk about them?</p> <p>\u0095 The Australian report, Factors Influencing the Educational Performance of Males and Females in School and their Initial Destinations after School, by Cherry Collins, Jane Kenway and Julie McLeod of Deakins University, Australia is available at <a href=\"http://www.detya.gov.au/schools/publications/index.htm\">www.detya.gov.au/schools/publications/index.htm</a></p>",
  "Two days into the towering inferno that blanked out Moscow television screens and deprived 10m Muscovites of their daily soap opera fix, the pinnacle of Europe's tallest structure was wobbling last night - a cruel symbol of how Russia's once soaring ambitions are tumbling into hubris and humiliation. <p>The Ostankino television tower, rising 540 metres (1,771ft) to dominate the capital's skyline, was until Sunday a monument to Russian power, prestige and hi-tech can-do, just as - until two weeks ago - the Kursk nuclear submarine was seen as a measure of Russia's military prowess. </p> <p>Gutted by fire and in danger of collapsing into a mangled heap of steel, cable and ferro-concrete, the TV tower yesterday made yet another eloquent mockery of President Vladimir Putin's pledges to make Russia great again. </p> <p>In contrast to his aloof, delayed reaction to the Kursk disaster, however, Mr Putin was quick yesterday to label the TV tower blaze a metaphor for the state of the nation. </p> <p>\"This emergency highlights the condition of our vital facilities as well as of the entire nation,\" he declared. \"Only economic development will enable us to prevent such calamities in the future.\" </p> <p>Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, said at first there was no risk of the tower collapsing, before changing tack and warning of \"a large danger\". The wobbling spire of the secular cathedral was not a problem, argued Anvar Shamuzafarov, chief of the national construction committee, as 300 firefighters finally extinguished the blaze last night. \"All deviations are within the norm,\" he said. </p> <p><b> Tilting</b><br> </p> <p>But a Moscow city surveyor said the tip of the tower was tilting 6ft off centre. The main fear was that the 149 steel cables holding up the slender 33-year-old concrete structure could buckle and send at least parts of it crashing. </p> <p>\"The cables are weakened, but not broken,\" said Vyacheslav Mulishkin, deputy head of the Russian fire department. </p> <p>There are few prouder symbols in Moscow of once-hailed Soviet supremacy than the Ostankino tower. Erected in 1967 at the height of the arms and space race with the US and to mark the Russian revolution's birthday, the north Moscow monument, with its revolving Seventh Heaven restaurant commanding panoramic views of the city, instantly overtook New York's Empire State Building as the world's tallest structure. </p> <p>That was then. Ten years of post-Soviet meltdown, retreat from empire, mass impoverishment and colossal corruption have turned Russia into a vast accident waiting to happen. </p> <p>The heyday of the Soviet space effort has given way to a crisis where the Mir space station is on its last legs, forever being patched up, and open to commercial offers from abroad. Latest estimates suggest it needs hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent it falling from its orbit and crashing to earth. </p> <p>August is habitually Russia's cruellest month and this year illustrates the rule - a bomb in the heart of Moscow, the sinking of the Kursk, the towering inferno. Last August brought more bombs in the city and the start of the Chechen war. The previous August brought the financial crash. And so on. </p> <p>But while the submarine sinking convulses Russia with grief and hijacks the world's emotions, and the dramatic pictures of the tower fire dominate the global TV screen, the sad fact of contemporary Russia is that disaster has become a drab and daily fixture. Yesterday alone, in addition to the Ostankino blaze, there were two booby-trap bombs in Grozny, the Chechen capital, a methane gas explosion at a mine in the Urals, and the bodies of two young conscripts were found north of Moscow. They had just shot themselves after going awol from their units. </p> <p>For the professional catastrophists employed by the government's ministry of emergencies come the predictions that endemic bungling, combined with lack of money, will lead to radiation and toxic alerts in the years ahead, as well as air crashes, pipeline ruptures and building collapses. </p> <p>Last week the Izvestiya newspaper reported that more than 1,000 servicemen die every year in peacetime accidents. The military prosecutor's office puts the toll from training mishaps, exploding ordnance and vehicle crashes at 1,100, though activist mothers campaigning for better conditions for their conscript sons put the figure at triple that. \"Natural wastage,\" the Russian military calls it. </p> <p>The daily litany of misfortune generates alarmist, populist politics playing on paranoia, conspiracy theories and fear. </p> <p>In the wake of the Kursk disaster, a \"red-brown\" group of nationalist and communist politicians, writers and editors issued a manifesto for \"national salvation\" to combat Russia's \"spiritual paralysis and despair. In these days of mourning, we are very clearly aware of the scale of the trouble into which Russia has been plunged,\" they proclaimed. \"Our people have been waging a great war for a decade, losing one million of our population every year, and leaving burning cities, blown-up apartment buildings, crashed airplanes, sunken ships, and devastated, depopulated regions, as well as countless graves of our compatriots behind on the battlefield.\" </p> <p>Russia was at \"war for the right to call itself Russia, to control the territory between three oceans, to speak its native language, to worship its holy things, and to honour its heroes and forebears... trying with its last strength to put ships out to sea and squadrons in the air, to pump oil and natural gas, to heat the houses, educate the children, nurse the orphans, and to keep faith in its sovereignty and inviolability, and in the inevitable Russian Victory\". </p> <p>Rather than victory, the current mood is one of demoralised defeatism. Even in the holiday season dozens of people are committing suicide; picking and eating poison mushrooms or bingeing on vodka and then drowning themselves in Moscow's rivers and lakes. </p> <p>President Putin's appeal to Russians is that he represents to them the best option for fashioning order from this chaos, stability from mayhem. But while he promises a restoration of greatness, he also told the grieving relatives of the Kursk crewmen last week that Russia had to learn to live within its means. And while the 118 were entombed in the submarine at the bottom of the Barents sea, the president debated Russia's brain-drain with prominent scientists and told them that only one in 20 businesses in the country were using modern equipment. </p> <p><b> Trapped</b><br> </p> <p> And if navy manpower and equipment were not up to mounting an effective rescue for the 118 seamen on the Kursk, so the 300 firefighters in northern Moscow yesterday were struggling to reach at least two people trapped in a lift about 1,000ft up the tower. As many as four people may have died in the gutted structure. </p> <p>All the evidence yesterday suggested that the conflagration had been sparked by negligence and refusals to heed warnings. The fire department said that even when first built, the tower had failed to satisfy the safety regulations. An inspection in May resulted in it being denied the required safety paperwork since its power supply system was 30% overloaded, making the kind of short circuit that occurred on Sunday afternoon virtually inevitable.</p>",
  "<p>There are several names Richard Blackwood would probably prefer never to hear again, at least not as part of the sentence \"So how do you compare yourself to ... ?\" Among them are Will Smith, the American comedian Chris Rock and, to a lesser extent, Ali G. There is no way around it, though, especially when Blackwood himself has expressed his ultimate ambition thus: \"I would love people to look at me the way they do Will Smith. To me, Will is the pinnacle of greatness in this business.\" </p> <p>Blackwood may still believe that, but no longer talks about it, not since the press began taking him at his word and asking if he thought a cult black comedian from south London could really compete with the $20m-per-film Smith. The tag \"Britain's Will Smith\" has followed him around since. It is an easy bit of descriptive shorthand, but it makes Blackwood appear to be puffing after Smith's Porsche on a rickety bike, as is often the lot of British versions of American superstars. </p> <p>Nor is he Britain's Chris Rock, as he has been labeled by more switched-on viewers who detect something of Rock's trendy political incorrectness in the 28-year-old Blackwood's streetwise approach. \"My act used to be much rawer,\" he says. \"I've said things like, 'Yardies aren't organised crime, they're just black people with guns. When did you ever see a black person who's organised?'\" Rock's humour is much more divisive, however, with its gags about the black middle class versus \"niggers\", which isn't where Blackwood is at, at all. Nor is he an Ali G, whose multi-layered concept - a white guy playing an Asian who thinks he's black - still has people wondering whether it's all right to laugh. </p> <p>His selling point, which he introduced to the wider nation last spring on his Channel 4 series, the Richard Blackwood Show, is cuddly inclusiveness. His stand-up routine mines a seam any youngish Briton will recognise - clubs, music and what to do when a gun-toting eight-year-old demands your wallet (\"Two days later I woke up in hospital ...\"), laced with a few F-words to reassure the rap generation. He also dresses rap for good measure: today he bounces into the Langham Hilton in London wearing a baseball cap, huge jeans and a jacket with \"New York\" across the front. </p> <p>He is smooth, assured and witty, but he has had to tone down his act because \"you can't be too black or you scare the mainstream - they think you have a chip on your shoulder. Someone who is powerful might not like it and they could stop you or stunt you. You have to pull them in softly.\" </p> <p>That speaks volumes about his ambitions, and why he is likely to be the only black British comic of his generation to realise them. Others, such as Curtis Walker and Geoff Schumann, are edgier, but Blackwood knows that the kind of success he craves depends on reaching a white audience. \"There's only two million black people in this country, which isn't enough for me to do strictly black comedy,\" he argues, Streatham vowels tumbling over each other. \"You can say anything you like onstage in America; you can say 'honky' or talk about enslavement and get a laugh, but not here. We've only been here 40 or 50 years.\" </p> <p>That is the reason he is no longer out there pounding the circuit like his competitors, the reason he is conducting this interview in the Hilton's Palm Court, where a dish of ice cream costs \u00a38. Early on, encouraged by his Jamaican parents (\"They told me not to segregate myself - if you're a comedian, you can't limit yourself\"), Blackwood grasped that he could either be \"raw\" and limit himself to fringe venues such as the Hackney Empire, where he started out as a stand-up in 1994, or give people what they want to hear, with a frosting of street culture, and become famous. It wasn't a hard decision. </p> <p>So far, the pay-off has been the Richard Blackwood Show (which came about after a successful stint as an MTV presenter) and a recent single called Mama - Who Da Man?, which made the top three. A single? Yes, his hunger for world domination has led Blackwood to launch a recording career and further fruits of it will be unveiled next week with the single 1234 - Get With the Wicked. It will be followed later in September by an album, You'll Love to Hate This. </p> <p>The defensive title acknowledges that people will be suspicious of a comedian making records, as they have every right to be, given precedents such as Mel Smith and Benny Hill. But Blackwood isn't completely cynical about music. He is a big fan of hip-hop and reggae and has tried, with the help of guests such as the ragga artist General Levy, to make an album that he himself would want to listen to. He has the advantage of coming from a musical family: and uncle, Junior Giscombe, had a worldwide hit in 1982 with Mama Used to Say, which Blackwood sampled on his first single. </p> <p> The result is, well, competent, but too heavily based on the over-worked conceit of presenting Blackwood as an omnipotent sex hunk, with female voices swooning \"We love you, RB!\" Eastwest Records A&amp;R director Cheryl Robson, who signed Blackwood for an astonishing \u00a31m if the rumours are true, calls it \"a party vibe\", which is probably code for \"We know he's not a musician, but cut him some slack\". Still, Will Smith's early records, back when he was the Fresh Prince, were hardly inspiring. And Blackwood is refreshingly open about his musical aims. </p> <p>\"I love music, hell, yeah,\" he asserts, twiddling a straw around his Diet Coke. He hasn't drunk alcohol since he was a teenager, and has never tried cigarettes or drugs. \"But do I wanna make a career of it? No. It's a platform, and one I'm embracing, definitely. But I'm a comedian and I'm here to do comedy.\" </p> <p>And to pursue his dream all the way to Hollywood, his ultimate goal. His determination has been boosted by having two role models in the family: Junior, and Naomi Campbell, who became his step-sister when his father married her mother. They have since divorced, but the comedian and the supermodel still \"sit down and bump heads\" occasionally. </p> <p>\"Life is about choices,\" says Blackwood solemnly. \"Racism pisses me off, but I try to take a humorous slant about tragic situations. I saw plenty of rough life, but I was fortunate that I had family who told me I had better choices. I wasn't that way, and my cousins who were, like if they got into a fight, they'd say, 'No, stay over there'. Though we're living in a time when drugs are everywhere, and back when I grew up it wasn't as bad with cocaine and crack. </p> <p>\"Guys say, 'You have to let me off, I didn't have a father', but I didn't have a father either, not 24/7 [24 hours a day, seven days a week]. Or my mum, she'd visit, but not 24/7. My mum was 17 and my dad was 19 when I was born. A lot of kids have young parents who can't instil values 'cos they're still learning themselves. I was lucky to have grandparents who instilled values.\" </p> <p>Blackwood's clarity and focus mean that his catchphrase, \"Who da man?\" is increasingly being answered by: \"You are, you good-looking wisecracking thing, you.\" Hollywood, here he comes - if they can understand a Streatham accent.</p>",
  "The British army insisted yesterday that it is not negotiating for the release of 11 of its soldiers snatched by the West Side Boys renegade militia in Sierra Leone. It is merely talking. <p>The army says it has received no demands from the young renegades, but people claiming to speak for the West Side boys have contacted local radio stations to say that they want food, medicine and the release of one of their leaders, known as Brigadier Bomb Blast, from prison before the British soldiers are freed. </p> <p>The first two demands are easily met on humanitarian grounds, but any demand to free Bomb Blast would be almost impossible to meet without compromising the very heart of what the British intervention in the African country is said to stand for. </p> <p>British forces were landed in May as the rebel Revolutionary United Front seized 500 United Nations peacekeepers, launched attacks towards Freetown and appeared to be about to seize power. </p> <p>The UK dispatched 1,000 troops, who secured the capital and airport, confronted the RUF in at least one battle that left close to 20 rebels dead, and assisted in capturing the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh. The British also laid out a military and political strategy to deal with the RUF which, over the following weeks, forced the rebels to retreat. </p> <p>Beyond the immediate moral demand of saving Freetown from more RUF atrocities, Britain said that it was helping to re-establish the rule of law and end the impunity with which soldiers, rebels and some politicians had murdered, raped and looted Sierra Leone close to destruction. </p> <p>Mr Sankoh was not summarily executed, as many Sierra Leoneans would have liked. Instead he will face an international war crimes tribunal that Britain has been instrumental in bringing about. That is why it would be almost impossible to accede to the West Side Boys' demand for the release of Bomb Blast, who was arrested a couple of months ago after a gun battle with an RUF rival on Freetown's streets. </p> <p>The British commander in Freetown, Brigadier Gordon Hughes, has already conceded that the apparent ease with which the renegades were able to capture his soldiers will be a blow to public confidence in his forces. Until now they have been viewed as something close to invincible. </p> <p>Surrendering to the West Side Boys' demands would also undercut confidence in British integrity, which has held up well among Sierra Leoneans, despite a widespread belief that London wound down its military intervention too soon. </p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, insisted from the start that the bulk of British forces would pull out by mid-June. </p> <p>By the time mid-June came, the Sierra Leone army had been beefed up, UN forces had been persuaded to fight and a military strategy to confront the rebels was in place. </p> <p>But there was a belief within the British force and among Sierra Leoneans that Mr Cook's timetable was driven more by political considerations than the reality. </p> <p>The rebels may have been on the retreat but victory was far from certain. Today, even a few miles from Freetown, security is still far from guaranteed. The road on which the soldiers were captured is a major route connecting the capital to the international airport and to cities in the north and east. That it should still remain so unstable several months after the RUF was driven from Freetown's gates, is viewed with foreboding locally. </p> <p>The UN launched Operation Thunderbolt last month to clear the West Side Boys' roadblocks but that did not stop the renegades from continuing to ambush cars. They are not alone. The bizarre Kamajor militia continues to extort, rape and even kill at roadblocks on major highways to Bo and other southern cities. </p> <p>For all the problems highlighted by the capture of the soldiers, the British army insists real political and military progress continues to be made against the rebels. But the crucial test will come at the end of the rainy season in December when the struggle for the diamond fields begins.</p>",
  "<p>Ah, computers - you can't live without them and you can't break them open with a chain saw and throw them out of your window, while screaming, \"Logical, my arse - you bloody things make less sense than my granny after her fifth Vimto and stout.\" Well, you can, but the neighbours complain. </p> <p>I am not a happy e-camper. I have just suffered a month of computer-induced lunacy which would not bear comparison with a life-threatening illness, but certainly did leave me with the strong desire to threaten a number of lives. </p> <p>First the historical background - 10 years ago, I worked as a writer-in-residence for a social work department and was given charge of a large Amstrad and its manual. With a lot of trial and error, we came to know each other rather well and I even gave very basic computing tutorials, now and then. Meanwhile, at home I had a baby Amstrad with a defective paper hopper which meant that printing out a novel involved crouching beside the thrashing daisy wheel for a day, wearing industrial ear defenders and feeding in paper by hand until my wrists went numb. But this was character-forming and only happened every year or so. </p> <p>Then planned obsolescence meant that I was sucked into the modern world of ludicrously large memories, ludicrously large programs and laptops. Even so, hell crept in surreptitiously and my first episode of computing dementia only appeared after a number of carefree years when my trusty laptop lapsed into a kind of lunatic haze. I won't bore you with the symptoms, suffice it to say that it seemed to have a memory problem. I mentioned as much to the 10-year-old an emergency repair company sent out. One hour and (if I remember) \u00a3115 later, said 10-year-old pattered through to confirm that my problem did indeed seem to be one of the memory variety. </p> <p> Meanwhile, an entire novel was quite possibly ineffectively saved on a variety of increasingly paranoid disks, while it apparently fluctuated in size for no reason and threatened to disappear entirely. Later a friend who happened by, without fee, dug about a bit and discovered that the machine had decided to fill its hard disk with pointless chains of information, to mark them irremovable and then sit there with the computing capacity of a small goldfish. Why did it do that? I have no idea. Nor did the other repairman I tried who directed his answers to each of my inquiries to the man standing next to me - men know about these things, you see. </p> <p>What all computer owners know and all computer manufacturers ensure, is that after five years pretty much anything to with information technology will do its best to self-destruct. And so it was that my most recent laptop started heading for its happy hunting grounds. It forgot how to type (and I only ever really used it as a grotesquely expensive typewriter), it rejected new software, it made odd noises and, when all else failed, intermittently played dead. This yanked me back immediately into the land of help lines. The two words help and line have, in this case, been fitted together by someone with a truly Satanic understanding of irony. </p> <p>Help lines don't. But they do come in a myriad of increasingly ghastly manifestations. They are discontinued numbers; they are numbers charged at \u00a31 per minute and staffed by inveterate chatterboxes with limited attention spans; they are more moderately priced numbers staffed by individuals who have never met a computer, but know how to turn one off and on again; they are labyrinthine holding patterns of muzak and \"Please continue waiting, your call is important to us\"; they are exorbitant replacements for free information websites; they are based in foreign countries and haunted by alarming pronunciation mutations; they demand your credit card details before an engineer will even cough in your direction; they are, in short, not helpful. </p> <p>But if you should weaken and buy another, newer, cuddlier computer which happens to arrive in less than working order, then you have the joys of arranging the emergency removal of your invalid between a delivery coordinator in France, a delivery service in Britain and a subcontractor in his van with a mobile. You have the pleasure of awaiting repairs which - depending on which person you speak to - are finished, almost finished and encountering mysterious and long-term delays. And then you have the unparalleled delight of receiving an even more dysfunctional device which the vendor is set on refusing to replace. </p> <p>Take my advice, in any computer-related transaction, take everyone's name, take everyone's superior's name, have a large man standing next to you and speak loudly of the 1978 Sale of Goods Act, because only coffin retailers can equal most computer suppliers' levels of chillingly absent after-sales consumer support. Spend the money, watch it rot - it's a natural law. </p> <p>\u0095 AL Kennedy's On Bullfighting was published in paperback by Vintage this July</p>",
  "Government plans to charge immigrants whose visa applications have failed up to \u00a3580 to appeal have been sharply criticised by the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux (Nacab) and a senior backbench Labour MP. <p>Under proposals for legislation which could be introduced this autumn, appellants would be charged \u00a3280 for written appeals and \u00a3580 if the rejection is contested in person. The government, which is reintroducing the right to appeal abolished by the last Conservative administration, said the charges were intended to cover court costs and had been insisted upon by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The Home Office and the Foreign Office have agreed not to charge for their services. </p> <p>Richard Dunstan, of Nacab, welcomed the restoration of the right to appeal but criticised the fees. \"The issue is that the value of the right of appeal will be seriously undermined by the imposition of fees because they will deter some wronged applicants from exercising that right,\" he said. </p> <p>\"There is no guarantee [of winning an appeal] even if you believe your case to be a strong one. There is a risk therefore, and some of those who are wrongly refused cannot afford to risk that sum of money. I hope very much that ministers in the Lord Chancellor's Department will consider their decision again.\" </p> <p>He said the number of appeals per year was likely to be in hundreds rather than thousands, \"so the total cost to the government would be relatively small\". </p> <p>He said: \"The only reason that the government has put forward in justification for imposing fees is that there is, in its own words, no new money for these visitor appeals. That reason evaporated last month with the chancellor's announcement of \u00a3600m for immigration control.\" </p> <p>Labour MP David Winnick, a member of the Commons home affairs select committee, yesterday joined in criticism of the proposals. </p> <p>\"I would rather have a system where no payment was involved at all,\" he said. \"But if there is to be payment the charges should be moderate. The sums which have been mentioned are certainly not moderate. I would imagine most Labour MPs would certainly be opposed to anything like \u00a3500.\" </p> <p>He said he believed that some ministers were unhappy about the charges, and that the lord chancellor \"would have a very limited knowledge of what happens at our surgeries and in our correspondence about constituents who are very keen for close family members to visit the UK\". </p> <p>The row over visa appeals comes after an immigration bond scheme which would have forced certain visitors entering the UK to pay a returnable deposit of around \u00a33,000 was dropped by the government after angry reactions from anti-racist and immigration support groups. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said it would be examining the points raised by Nacab.</p>",
  "Dictators and torturers across the world may be sleeping a little less soundly these days. Not because of a sudden attack of conscience, but because Labour - through its recently published draft legislation - is helping to tip the international balance away from impunity and toward justice. <p>Our draft bill will put Britain's full weight behind the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) which will be a giant step forward for human rights and the rule of international law. For the first time there will be an international body to try individuals responsible for the worst crimes known to humankind. Future Pol Pots and Pinochets should be warned: merchants of oppression, atrocity and genocide, however powerful or feared in their own country, can be brought to justice. And through scrupulously fair trials which can place the blame on individuals rather than communities, the ICC will promote peace and reconciliation. </p> <p>Based in The Hague, the ICC will build on the model and jurisprudence established to try Nazis in Nuremberg and the current war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But uniquely, the ICC will have a forward-looking and potentially global mandate. </p> <p>The ICC will deal with three clearly defined offences: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It will have jurisdiction over crimes committed after its establishment - not over past atrocities. The main responsibility for punishing crimes will remain that of nation states. The ICC will only intervene if the countries concerned have proved unable or unwilling genuinely to investigate the crimes themselves. This might happen where conflict has led to the collapse of the local judicial system or where a dictatorial government refuses to punish its own abusers. </p> <p>Except when the UN Security Council refers situations to the court, the ICC will only have jurisdiction over crimes committed in countries which have ratified the court's statute, or by their nationals. It will look to states to provide evidence, arrest suspects and enforce the sentences it passes down. </p> <p>Like any body which emerges from many years of extensive negotiation involving the international community, the ICC will be neither a magic wand nor an all-powerful Big Brother. But because it is the product of international agreement, rather than unilateral initiative, the ICC's decisions will represent the will, and demand the respect, of the whole world. </p> <p>Under Labour, Britain has already proved itself one of the court's strongest supporters. We proved it by our pivotal role at the successful Rome conference that adopted the ICC Treaty. We proved it by helping to give the court the power to punish not only those who massacre civilians but also those who commit sexual violence or use child soldiers. And we continue to prove it by doing our best to mobilise international support for the court, including by lobbying reluctant countries such as the US. </p> <p> The legislation will enable Britain to provide maximum assistance to the ICC. For example, it will allow the law-enforcement authorities to identify, arrest and, through a streamlined process, surrender war crimes suspects to The Hague. It will allow us to gather evidence, freeze assets and enforce court sentences. </p> <p>And it will empower our courts to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed here or by UK nationals overseas. This means that we will always be able to fulfil our responsibility to prosecute such crimes. </p> <p>Our ambition is to be one of the court's founding members. The bill will enable Britain to ratify the Rome statute of the ICC and so push up the number of ratifications towards the 60 countries needed for the statute to come into force and for the ICC to begin its work. </p> <p>We are publishing the bill in draft for comments by October 12 because we want to maximise agreement before its parliamentary introduction, especially among those with particular interests or expertise. There is widespread, cross-party support for the ICC. The more civil society and government can cooperate over the details in the bill implementing the treaty, the greater the chance of making quick parliamentary progress. </p> <p>That will also depend upon cooperation between government and opposition parties. I have written to them and to a wide range of parliamentarians asking for their comments on the draft. We are genuinely open to suggested changes which improve the bill without destroying it. My objective is to have a bill which is in the best possible shape and enjoys maximum cross-party consensus ready for introduction as soon as parliamentary time allows. </p> <p>But it is important that the bill does not get caught in the middle of the kind of parliamentary filibustering or obstruction of other contentious legislation in which opposition parties have always indulged. A commitment by all the parties to the smooth passage of this bill would be a clear message to the world's tyrants that the British people are united in wanting international justice. </p> <p> Peter Hain is minister of state at the Foreign Office.

Of course, the biggest potential danger attached to Pat's jewellery is Pat herself. Or rather her amazing sexual allure, which has once again intoxicated Frank, who, after see ing her flamenco, is all set to throw caution to the wind and attempt to cast a net over Pat's heart. </p> <p>However, the sexual intrigue and love parallelogram between Fat Pat, Coy Roy, Frank Frank and Peggy (who isn't as leggy as to justify it as her nickname) are just sideshows to the main event in Spain: Irene's Alicante existential angst. </p> <p>When Irene first appeared in Walford - ex-sister-in-law of Kathy, mother to the swinging-like-a-weathervane Tony and Sarah \"Eyebrows\" Hills - she was a harpie in a satinette dressing gown. But last night, her transformation into sympathetic, thwarted heroine was complete. Never entirely happy with Terry - and even less so since her plundering of Troy - finally it was the teabags that broke the camel's back. And when it broke, the torrent of rage, frustration, self- loathing and self-doubt that Roberta Taylor unleashed was undeniably moving. </p> <p>By containing the action within the three couples, the Spain special avoided past \"EastEnders on tour\" disasters, with no crass stereotypes (the Fowlers' Oirish adventure, say) or comedy capers. While the script was clich\u00e9-ridden and a tad heavy-handed - Pat is an R Kelly fan? - so is life, and we can give writer Tony Jordan the benefit of the doubt. One thing that was weird though: is Alicante the land of the midnight sun or had Frank and Pat stayed out at dinner for a whole 24 hours? </p> <p>In case you weren't sure, <strong> Gladiators: The Brutal Truth</strong> (BBC2) put paid to the scurrilous rumour that the gladiators of ancient Rome were animal-loving, child-friendly, dab-hands-at-macram\u00e9 types, the Blue Peter presenters of ye olden times. According to Terry Jones - and you might have missed this bit in Ridley Scott's Gladiator, presumably the phenomenon which got this project the go-ahead - gladiators killed people. In horrible ways. With big swords. </p> <p>And they didn't spend their days making daisy chains at all. The Bafta Award for Stating the Obvious goes to... Actually, Gladiators: The Brutal Truth wasn't that bad - as history programmes for 10-year-olds go. As he scampered around the ruins of old Pompeii, Jones warned that the Romans had nice houses but \"that doesn't mean they shared our values\". (Doesn't it? So the Nazis, who built such nice motorways, weren't nice either? Surprise, surprise.) </p> <p>Instead of really homing in on and exploring the issue of how the public of Rome were the driving force behind the gladiatorial battles, the public executions, the lions and tigers and bears (oh my) ripping Christians to bits, the blind fury and loathesome power of the mob was a footnote, not the central plank of the documentary. Intelligent musing lost out to spectacle, and hence we were treated to Jones in a mini-toga fighting a wooden pole instead of an examination of how the public is the fiercest predator of all. </p> <p>And speaking of wooden performances, <strong> Steps Into Summer</strong> (BBC1) was so beyond bad, it wasn't even so-bad-it's-good. It was just bad. There were so many lowlights it'd be difficult to pinpoint one exactly, but the version of I Know Him So Well made me yearn for Mel and Sue on Stars In Their Eyes. Yet the fivesome are so incredibly liked, selling bucketloads of records. It can only be the Jane McDonald syndrome: how we Brits like the plucky amateurs or at least the amateur-sounding, the faux humble, the celebs we can imagine down the pub doing karaoke. Like redcoats on ketamine, Steps embody everything cheesy and awful about British culture. </p> <p>On a plane with that lot, you'd want Pat by the emergency exit.</p>",
  "The right for a baby, conceived after a father's death, to have his name on the birth certificate; the right for young people in care (and not in receipt of child benefit) to have a nest egg from the Treasury when they become adults; and that most tortured of decisions, the right of \"Mary\" not to be separated from her Siamese twin, \"Jodie\", even though this may mean death for both - supported by the twins' parents but rejected by Mr Justice Johnson - all are issues which highlight, yet again, that it is not just in the aftermath of a child abuse scandal or some terrible misdemeanour by \"bad\" boys and girls that the issue of children's rights have to be addressed properly in a democratic society. <p>Over 100 organisations, including the National Confederation of Parent and Teacher Associations and several dozen MPs had hoped that this summer, after more than a decade of campaigning, spurred on by Sir Ronald Waterhouse's report on abuse in Welsh children's homes, the government would appoint a children's commissioner for England. A commissioner is on the agenda for Scotland while Northern Ireland's Human Rights Commission has a remit which covers the young. </p> <p>Eighteen commissioners or ombudsmen are in place around the world including those in Australia, Guatemala and Denmark. In Spain, the city of Madrid has had an ombudsman since 1996 with wide powers including the clout to investigate individual cases and the ability to issue warnings (for instance, on inaccurate images of the young in the media). Issues tackled include immigrant and marginilised children; children's free time and the development of children's councils in the city. (Perhaps one way of encouraging adult participation later in the democratic process?) So how do we measure up in England? </p> <p>Labour is, of course, committed to building a human rights culture and modernising government. It has invested hugely in childcare and alleviating child poverty. It even promised a commissioner and a minister for children in its 1992 manifesto. All of which makes its bout of midsummer madness on the establishment of an English commissioner all the more inexplicable. </p> <p>Under the new Care Standards Act, England will have, instead, a children's rights director. He or she will be concerned only with the 200,000 children living away from home, for instance, in residential care and boarding schools. The other 11m young people under the age of 18 will remain without an equivalent representative voice. The government also tried to foist a director with slightly wider powers on the Welsh Assembly but to its credit, it is having none of it. Instead, the assembly is pushing for a commissioner with a role closer to that defined by its health and social services committee earlier this year. </p> <p>The Welsh commissioner, as defined by the committee, would promote the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (which includes political, and economic goals); require impact statements to assess the affect of policies on the young; conduct an annual audit on the state of Wales's children; encourage research; monitor government actions; raise the profile of the young and act as champion, watchdog and whistleblower. A commissioner would also have the power to inquire into breaches of children's rights and demand action. \"At the heart of our need for a commissioner,\" the committee concluded, \"Is the need for all of us to listen to all children and young people; to have a genuine commitment to reflecting their views.\" </p> <p> It sounds like common sense - so why has the government backed off in England? Does an ombudsman require too much administrative upheaval? Or can it be fear of a certain section of the population who view children's rights as a euphemism for infant anarchy and adults wronged? Those who believe that \"rights\" basically boils down to smacking - and that's nobody's grown-up business but their own? </p> <p>Moira Rayner, a New Zealand lawyer with international experience in children's rights, now has three years to challenge such head-in-the- sand ideas - and to add to the pressure on government to appoint an English commissioner with strong statutory powers. Rayner is director of the newly created Office of the Children's Rights Commissioner for London. </p> <p>One of the least publicised promises made in the mayoral election was to appoint \"a children's champion\" in the assembly. Livingstone has yet to fill the post. Nevertheless, Rayner's work (guided by a panel of young people and partly funded by the lottery) is already underway. She is preparing a report on the state of London's children and (with Livingstone's officers) drawing up a strategy. \"If London can get it right for children,\" runs her argument. \"Any major city can.\" </p> <p>\"Children's rights are often confused with civil rights - for instance, the right to freedom of association,\" Rayner says. \"What they're actually about is social rights - the right to a decent quality of life. And the right for a child's views to be treated seriously when important decisions are made about the society in which we all live. They don't cancel out adult responsibility but they do encourage fair play and cooperation.\" </p> <p>London has 1.74m young people under 18. Twice the national proportion live in workless households. But Rayner is keen that the government's obligations aren't restricted to minimising risk and tackling poverty, important though those goals are. What also matter, she argues, are positive measures to stimulate the well-being of the young, for instance, in transport, the environment and health. (The NSPCC too has long argued for well-being indicators to establish a coordinated national measure of child development.) </p> <p>In July, with little fanfare, the government established a children's unit to coordinate efforts. Instead of being anchored in the Cabinet Office alongside the women's unit and the social exclusion unit, as organisations such as the NSPCC had hoped, the children's unit has been sited in the Department of Education and Employment, backed by a cross-governmental committee chaired by Paul Boateng, at the Home Office. </p> <p>The government has also said it will monitor the progress of the Welsh Children's Commissioner before taking a decision on an English equivalent - although the worldwide evidence already exists. A clear strong voice is missing. As Sir William Utting, former Chief Inspector of Social Services, says, \"Governments are dominated by the pushes and pulls of an electorate in which only grown-ups have votes, and issues about children are, as a result, continuously overshadowed... Children need a strong independent office to represent their interests comprehensively and to ensure that public and private agencies deliver what law and public policy require.\" </p> <p>That is understood and accepted in Scotland, Ireland and Wales - why not in England too? </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com </a></p>",
  "In opposition the words could not have been bolder. It was time for government commitment to families to be extended to immigration and asylum procedures too. These were not just bold but brave words in an election atmosphere in which the Tories, playing the race card with a 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act, prompted the Economist to declare they deserved \"contempt, not votes, for proposing (such a) nasty little bill\". Labour was unequivocal: \"It is in no one's interest that close family members are divided by arbitrary and unjust regulations.\" And it was quite specific about the need of families to be together for special events - weddings, births and funerals. The appeal procedure for people refused a visitor's visa for such events, abolished by the Tories in 1993, would be restored. <p>One year into government, restoring the right of appeal was still being upheld, but by then justice had a price, which charging appeal fees could recover. Three years on from the election, the precise cost to the government of an appeal has been calculated: \u00a3280 for a paper decision and \u00a3580 for an oral hearing. In a new consultative document, ministers are proposing applicants should be required to meet this cost over and above their own legal fees. If an appeal succeeded, the fee could be returned, but as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureau (Nacab) noted yesterday, many applicants would not be able to afford such a risk. Given the reputation of our hardline immigration procedures, who would want to rely on receiving a fair deal? One out of five appeals in the old system succeeded, but that meant four out of five failed. </p> <p>Labour should go back to first principles. They were right to emphasise the importance of supporting families. They were right to recognise the bonding which special events achieve. There was never any suggestion in the old system of charging appellants. Why are Labour ministers introducing it in the new? The only explanation has been that there is no new money for such appeals but, as Nacab has noted, this reason evaporated last month with the chancellor's announcement of \u00a3600m extra for immigration control. One Labour MP, David Winnick, has already protested. Others should follow in his wake. The government's proposal is mean, dishonest and in breach of civil liberties. It should be rejected.</p>",

  "<p>If you want to see Picasso's 1907 masterpiece Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, pride of the greatest collection of modern art in the world, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, you have to sidle into a strange sin-bin just above the temporary cafe. This is where Picasso's explosive assault on reality has been relegated, like an embarrassing elderly relative, in a rum show called Collection Highlights. </p> <p>Moma, the institution that is synonymous with the very idea of modern art, is going through a convulsive change. Collection Highlights is one product of that change as the museum undergoes a year-long, three-part rehang which culminates in the autumn with Moma's first full survey of contemporary art since 1960. This promises to be the most dramatic new display in its history, one that abandons its infamous linear narrative of modern art in favour of a year-long series of collage-like shows. </p> <p>Founded by wealthy Manhattan art lovers in 1929 when Picasso was at best the butt of cartoonists' \"three-eyed girlfriend\" gags, this museum has championed the modern movements from surrealism to pop, given a home to European artists and artworks in exile - Picasso's Guernica was cared for here throughout the Franco dictatorship - and made modernism distinctively American. Along the way it has acquired the most comprehensive and imposing collection of modern art that is ever likely to be assembled anywhere. </p> <p>Moma founded its reputation on high-handed certainty. It was revered and feared for the way it determined the history of art. It devised the evolutionary story of modern art as a succession of \"isms\". Alfred H Barr, director of the museum in the mid-20th century, saw the history of modern art movements as a linear progress toward the supreme goal of abstraction. A rehang in 1993 maintained this story of modern art in which you walked from Monet's lily pond to C\u00e9zanne's Mont St Victoire to Picasso's brothel. </p> <p>But now the museum has had a breakdown. Not that you can blame it. For 30 years academic critics have been deconstructing modernism. And when they pick apart the history of modern art, they attack modern art's most powerful institution. Moma has even been outed as a front for the CIA in the 50s, when its international touring shows of American art were supposedly little more than Cold War propaganda exercises. </p> <p>The museum has capitulated; it has shoved scores of great paintings into the background to make way for photographs, home movies, outsider art and the cute suburban realist Norman Rockwell. The year-long changing displays collectively entitled Moma 2000 tell a story of pluralism, and the wishy-washy consequences of this are revealed in the names of the sections of the hang: Making Choices, to be followed by Open Ends. </p> <p>The assumption behind Moma's reshuffle, like the Tate's, appears to be that to continue creating, we have to free ourselves from a burdensome history. Picasso has to be put in his place. Less well-known currents of 20th-century art have to be given more weight. But was the grand narrative of modern art ever so oppressive? </p> <p>Moma is a monument to the creative value of bigotry. In the middle of the 20th century it set itself up as guardian of an unarguable truth. It claimed to speak for the high tradition of art in our time and demanded new art live up to it. According to the current curatorial consensus, this ought to have been disastrous. Art in New York in the shadow of Moma ought to have shrivelled. But that is not what happened. </p> <p>In the few rooms at Moma given over to Collection Highlights, you turn a corner and Jackson Pollock's One (No 31, 1950) dances in mid-air, a rapturous, inexhaustible frieze. Pollock painted with Moma's history of modernism before his eyes. He was not intimidated. Art in New York in the 40s, 50s and 60s was more creative than anywhere else in the 20th century except Paris before the first world war. And it was creative because artists had something to sharpen their teeth on. </p> <p>This is the lesson the collection of the Museum of Modern Art really teaches: that a sense of history is essential to the making of art. The lesson is conveyed in the Collection Highlights room that focuses on 50s New York. Across from the Pollock is a painting that could not be more different, yet could not have existed without it. Jasper Johns's Target with Four Faces (1955) is the work of a young artist who wanted to make an impact in a New York dominated by Pollock's followers in the abstract expressionist school - how better than by doing the opposite of Pollock? </p> <p>Where Pollock's painting is rangy, splashy, spontaneous, Johns' Target is uptight and laboriously thought out. Johns used a method of painting - encaustic, an ancient wax-based technique - that enabled him to build up his image in dense, static layers. Instead of flowing like Pollock's expressive drips, it is set like wax. The painting includes four macabre cast faces that heighten the chilly surrealism. Under the paint are collaged newspaper stories; you can make out a title from a book-review page entitled \"History and Biography\". </p> <p>So different, yet the Pollock and the Johns are similar. They both speak of encoded, inarticulate memory; whatever history and biography may lie concealed in Johns' Target, there is the same sense of secret history in Pollock's art. This is a creative, healthy dialogue of artists. The picture of Moma as modernist oppressor is also undermined by the fact that Alfred H Barr, high priest of -isms, bought three of Johns' postmodern paintings for the museum, including Target, from his first solo exhibition at the Castelli gallery in 1958. He also wanted to buy Flag (1954-5), but was afraid the trustees would see it as anti-American, so he got the architect Philip Johnson to buy it and present it to Moma later as a gift. </p> <p>The deficiencies of the new, softer history of modern art are obvious when you go from this room to the version of 50s Manhattan as presented in the new displays. Here we are told that art in 50s New York was wildly divergent in approach. Divergent in quality, too, it appears. Second-rate abstract expressionists, realists, the idiosyncratic Louise Bourgeois and the almost-pop Larry Rivers are hung together in a display that completely fails to capture the excitement of the period. What is missing right through the new-look Moma is a sense of urgency. Some of the displays are better than others, but always you feel infra-academic games are being played and this great collection is not being shown off. </p> <p>A comparison with Tate Modern is hard to avoid. The Tate has done a similar display with far more style, perhaps because it has fewer inhibi tions; the Tate owns about one fifth of the great art Moma does so it can afford to take risks. Conversely, where Moma 2000 does score is in being more extensive than the Tate. A section called Walker Evans and Co, treats the documentary photographer of the 30s as a hidden influence on artists from Robert Rauschenberg to Sherrie Levine and places photography at the heart of American art. It is a major exhibition in itself and juxtaposes such gems as Robert Frank's 50s photographs of the American heartland and Edward Hopper's painting of a sad usherette in a Manhattan movie theatre. A display dedicated to Alfred Jarry and the College of Pataphysics is astonishing, and the museum's stores have been ransacked for treasures such as an Angus Calder model of the Universe and what feels like the entire early work of Louise Bourgeois. But this very scholarly thoroughness - in contrast to Tate Modern's infectious populism - adds to the sense of a slightly jaded exercise by curators whose main aim is to impress their colleagues. As for the rest of us, we can go see the Collection Highlights. </p> <p>The fact is that for most of us, modern art is still provocative. Picasso is still provocative. Pollock is still provocative, and so are the contemporary artists Moma will be showing in depth in September, including Rachel Whiteread, Robert Gober and Charles Ray. The oldest museum of modern art in the world naturally wants to reinvent itself so it will influence the art of the 21st century as decisively as it did the 20th. The museum is already preparing for a massive building project that will almost double its exhibition space. It will close its doors for much of the process, which will be complete in 2004-5. Doubtless when it reopens its current hesitancy will give way to the customary hectoring manner. Meanwhile the home of modern art appears to be London.</p>",
  "Police investigating the shooting of two doormen during fighting at a nightclub early yesterday have arrested five men and two women for alleged violent disorder. <p>None of them is thought to be directly involved in the double shooting, which happened as the two doormen tried to eject about 30 people involved in fighting in one of three nightclubs in the Epping Forest country club complex in Chigwell. </p> <p>Trouble continued outside the club and the doormen, both in their 20s, were shot, Essex police said.

  "In store rooms across the city, the careful touch of the Renaissance masters is flaking. Cracks appear on 15th century canvas, and first aid maintenance is the best that can be applied. Alongside lie other works, gradually deteriorating. <p>No one is certain of the extent of the malaise. Only one point is irrefutable: it cannot continue like this. </p> <p>The wealth that once made Glasgow the second city of the empire has slipped away. Its legacy, however, remains: one of the great city collections of Europe, with eight main museums and galleries bulging with 1.5m objects. But from Old Masters to rusting armour the problem is constant: how to preserve and utilise the collection when inadequate funding has brought it to crisis point. </p> <p>\"Of all the cities in Europe, Glasgow was the one that led the way in changing its international standing and perception through tourism based on museums,\" said Neil McGregor, director of the National Gallery in London. \"If Glasgow is in crisis now, what does this bode for the rest of Britain's municipal museums - and tourism?\" </p> <p>Polly Smith, the city's senior conservator, admits she has no idea what state many of the 3,500 canvases are in. The results of a survey now under way may make uncomfortable reading. Ms Smith is Glasgow's only fine art conservator, and she does what she euphemistically calls \"prioritising\". A blunter phrase is fire-fighting. </p> <p>Renaissance works by Montagna, Pessellino and Dossi are deteriorating. It takes weeks, sometimes months, to conserve a painting. The decay of other paintings comes to light from time to time. When the Tate in London asked to borrow three paintings by William Blake, staff were shocked by their condition. </p> <p>\"With a reduced staff, the quantity of work we carry out has to be reduced,\" said Ms Smith. \"I can prioritise and save important paintings, with first aid treatment, from deteriorating irrevocably. But say if a painting is on display with a discoloured varnish, the public is not seeing what the artist intended. </p> <p>\"There are also problems with maintenance. With more resources we could properly assess and deal with the needs of the collection.\" </p> <p>The problem does not lie merely with conservation. A report by city councillors on council museums has shown that Glasgow spends only 10% of what it should on museum education; staffing levels are less than half those in national museums; and curatorial work has been cut to the bone. </p> <p>There is little appetite for blaming the council, however. With huge problems in housing, education and social work to be tackled, it is no surprise that the museum budget is squeezed. </p> <p>\"If we go on for another couple of years like this, we will be in very grave danger of losing some of the collection,\" said John Lynch, vice convenor of Glasgow's culture and leisure committee. </p> <p>The councillors' report can see only three ways out of problem: to ask the Scottish executive for an extra \u00a32.2m; to transfer some museums - notably the Burrell collection, jewel in the city's year of culture crown - to a trust, although this would still leave a big hole in funding; or to seek national help, developing a partnership between central and local government. </p> <p>\"It's something that has to be addressed imminently,\" said Chris Mason, the councillor who chaired the report group. </p> <p>In 1986, when Liverpool reached the depths of its troubles and Margaret Thatcher abolished Merseyside council, the new Liverpool city council gave its museums up to national control, and they have thrived. Liverpool has a collection on a par with Glasgow's, but it has 40 conservators compared with Glasgow's 13. The National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside is about to spend \u00a334m improving three museums; Glasgow's entire budget for the year is \u00a316m. </p> <p>But this is unlikely to be the solution for Glasgow. \"It would be washing our hands of the situation,\" said Mr Lynch. \"Glaswegians feel an affinity with their art collection; there is little to be gained from breaking that bond. What we want to do is encourage the socially excluded to use the museums by making them aware of their ownership.\" </p> <p>The Scottish executive, too, has no desire to take responsibility for Glasgow's problems. </p> <p>Ministers are aware of the crisis, but money will not flow in immediately. The national cultural strategy was published last week, and an audit of all Scotland's museums has been ordered. </p> <p>The city council has requested an urgent meeting with the Scottish executive. </p> <p>Dr McGregor said: \"In Germany, France and Italy, museums are funded by arrangements between local and national governments. Perhaps that is the model for Glasgow. </p> <p>\"What we have to realise, though, is that we cannot continue to be so blas\u00e9 with our national heritage. We need to decide now how we are going to maintain it - and how we are going to pay for it.\"</p>",

(It was in fact posted to at least one, the newsgoup alt.politics.liberalism.) <p>An interesting story is the way the internet can generate \"campaigns\", including very unrepresentative ones, because it makes it easier for those with extreme views to find, encourage, and support each other. Another is the way the media are unprepared for the effects of the internet on their ways assessing opinion. <br><b>Jeff Dalton </b><br>University of Edinburgh <br><a href=\"mailto:J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk\">J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 I liked Polly Toynbee's analysis in her original article. During the previous weeks I too watched the US presidential campaign - the entire party conventions live on TV, in the UK. I am not sure why so much TV time is given to events in America. I did not realise, until I experienced it, the amount of attention that the media gives to the US in UK. I wish the US was able to do the same about the events in Europe and the world. Our children know every detail about football players in America, but ask them where Hong Kong is and they may well say Latin America. <br><b>Steven Kadivar </b><br> Woodside, USA <br> <a href=\"mailto:skadivar@hotmail.com\">skadivar@hotmail.com</a> </p> <p>\u0095 Europe alone cannot act as a counterweight to the US. Only the concerted authority of the rest of the world, acting through the UN, can stand up to overweening might of the US. To strengthen the rule of international law we need \"coalitions of the willing\", involving developing countries and Europe working together, as over the statute for the International Criminal Court and the landmines ban. We also need a robust system of democratic accountability at a global level, so that all countries and international agencies can be challenged to live up to their commitments under the UN charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international law. </p> <p>Next month world leaders meet in New York to discuss the future of the UN. This is an opportunity to strengthen democratic accountability in international decision-making, so that no country, however powerful, is above the law. This is our only hope for tackling global climate change, nuclear proliferation, third world debt and poverty. <br><b>Titus Alexander </b><br>Chair, Charter 99 <br><a href=\"mailto:info@charter99.org\">info@charter99.org</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 It's sad but entirely predictable that Polly Toynbee's excellent article should produce such an ill considered and rude response. The highly selfish nature of US politics is down to two main reasons, the highly flawed \"democratic\" system, in which power is wielded by corporate America, rather than the people; and the complacency of a large proportion of the population, who cannot see the difference between economic, technological and military world leadership, and moral world leadership - despite the appalling record the US has on environmental issues, arms control, gun laws and so on. </p> <p>It is not a case of \"my Europe right or wrong\". We can build a Europe that is strong, democratic and environmentally responsible, and must do if the world's major problems are to be dealt with internationally. <br><b>Joe Charnock</b><br>Boston, USA</p>",
  "The exclusion of billions who are poor, illiterate, rural or non-English speaking from the evolving global information infrastructure has serious effects and the digital divide is fast becoming a critical issue for developing countries. Mark Atkinson is right to question the hype surrounding information and communication technology and the world's poor (Poor need penicillin before Pentiums, August 28). The rhetoric of political and corporate leaders on digital divide must be matched by responding to real needs and not exacerbating global inequity. The challenge is to ensure that both the growing worldwide digital divide and initiatives to address it do not compound the existing gap between rich and poor. <p> </p> <p>The internet can and should be harnessed for sustainable development. <a href=\"http://www.OneWorld.net\" target=\"_NEW\">OneWorld.net</a>, the world's largest online community of NGOs, works with hundreds of grassroots groups in poor countries who tackle hardship head on. Many of those working with and on behalf of the poor now use the internet, connecting with individuals and organisations in the west and developing countries to share knowledge and take action on poverty and human rights. New technology, when used appropriately, is a vital new tool to promote global justice and to support programmes that aim to meet the basic needs of the most disadvantaged peoples in our world. </p> <p>Access to the internet is not more important than alleviating hunger or providing access to shelter, healthcare, clean water and education, but it can no longer be separated from these concerns. <br><b>Glen Tarman </b><br> OneWorld<br><a href=\"mailto:media@oneworld.net\">media@oneworld.net</a> </p> <p>\u0095 I was dismayed to see you joining the clamour for \"free\" internet for all (Leader, August 23). What is so special about this electronic medium of information exchange? The argument that we must not tolerate social exclusion holds no water. If it did, why not free travel, post, phones, newspapers, et al? The net represents a staggeringly large capital investment that deserves its entrepreneurial return. The old adage that there is no such thing as a free lunch holds here just as anywhere else - if it is free, is it worth anything? </p> <p> </p> <p>Most net surfing is just that, idle scanning for trivia or titillation. Genuine information searches and business transactions make up a tiny percentage of logged on time. Let those who must, pay. By all means rein in monopoly players such as BT, but if information (or entertainment) has value then it must surely warrant a cost. <br><b>Adrian Bates</b><br>Micheldever, Hants </p>"
