  "<p> <strong> Lumumba </strong> <br>Filmhouse/Cameo 3 ****</p> <p> There is something of the Shakespearean epic about Lumumba, director Raoul Peck's second investigation of the deposed prime minister of the Congo. While 1991's much-feted Lumumba - Death of a Prophet was a straight-forward documentary, this account of the rise and fall of the Democratic Republic of Congo's enigmatic first prime minister takes the bare facts and weaves a mesmerising, grand, timeless drama. </p> <p>Lumumba's story is told as the flashback of a man waiting for his execution, with interventions from an anniversary celebration of Congo's independence and his actual murder bookending the main narrative. From his days selling beer to the budding of his political career, a captivating central performance from Eriq Ebouaney makes Lumumba's story irresistible. Ebouaney inhabits this most compassionate and fierce of characters with pathos and passion. </p> <p>As the land he fought to free slips beyond his control and the political machinations of post-colonial government start to churn against him, Peck's story of Lumumba's martyrdom never once stoops to sentimentality. With a dazzling array of stunning set pieces - the army raids on the marketplace, the burning of Lumumba's body and an exquisite moment on a deserted runway - this is a film which brands itself onto the conscience and leaves Lumumba's hopeful words about \"the history of a new Africa\" ringing in the ears. </p> <p> At the Filmhouse tonight and Cameo 3 on Thursday.

  "<p><strong>BBC Symphony Orchestra/Saraste</strong><br> Royal Albert Hall, London **** </p> <p>Christian Lindberg's determination to establish the trombone as a credible solo instrument has already produced more than 70 specially commissioned concertos from different composers. On Friday he appeared with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Proms for the British premiere of a work written for him by Luciano Berio last year. SOLO - the capital letters seem de rigueur - was the central panel in a programme conducted by Jukka-Pekka Saraste that also included Sibelius's En Saga and Tchaikovsky's Path\u00e9tique Symphony. </p> <p>An important part of Lindberg's mission is to bring gravitas to the image of his instrument. The common perception of the trombone has been that of a poor relation to its orchestral colleagues, getting comically out of its depth when asked to do anything lyrical or expressive. Berio made use of that tendency towards absurdity early in his career, in his solo-trombone Sequenza V; that 1965 work required the soloist to act as well as play and its bittersweet humour was conceived as a tribute to the Italian clown Grock. </p> <p>But in SOLO there is no clowning around. The nearest this 20-minute movement comes to theatricality is at the climax of spectacular bravura passage for the soloist, which is saluted by a derisory cheer from the members of the orchestra. Otherwise, it's the ability of the trombone to sing that Berio concentrates upon. He relies on Lindberg's astonishing technique, and his ability to sustain huge arching phrases without ever seeming to take a breath, to project that line while the orchestra spins a web of glinting, intricate textures around it. </p> <p>All the familiar fingerprints of Berio's concertante works are here. Kindred instruments in the orchestra - three trombones and a tuba - mediate between the soloist and the orchestra, while horns and trumpets reinforce the brassy brilliance of the scoring. Sometimes the solo trombone duets with the principal trombone behind him, elsewhere he is shadowed by a bass clarinet, or eclipsed by interjections from the rest of the woodwind. The strings are generally used to fill in the harmonic background. </p> <p>This is not the conventional concerto confrontation between a soloist and the orchestra. Berio creates a much more symbiotic relationship between the two. Everything grows organically from the endlessly sustained note, a D, that begins the work and to which it returns at the end - pitches expand around it, chords are filled in and just occasionally references to past masterpieces flit past. The whole process has that effort less certainty and musicality that are Berio's very special gift. SOLO is not one of his greatest works, but still a fine example of his originality and craftsmanship. </p> <p>It's also a superb demonstration of what Lindberg can do, and what he is achieving as the world's only full-time solo trombonist. His playing was astounding, not only in its sheer technical completeness but also in its musicality. The work is a celebration of lyricism, and he is a master of that, just as much as Berio.</p>",

  "<b>The big issue : Should we be getting in a funk about jazz?</b> <br> <p>While agreeing wholeheartedly with Cleo Laine's assertion that UK jazz is as good as any in the world (Review, last week) - one only has to hear Howard Riley, Mike and Kate Westbrook, or Andy Sheppard to be convinced of this - I feel she is wrong to lay some of the blame for its neglect at the feet of jazz journalists. </p> <p>As someone who has worked for three national newspapers as a jazz writer, I can assure her that it is arts editors, to a man and woman, entirely uninterested in jazz, who prevent their writers covering UK players, on the grounds that jazz is 'self-evidently' a US art form, and that readers will not be interested in the home-grown article. </p> <p>Incidentally, while working for the Daily Telegraph , I requested an interview with John Dankworth prior to a Generation Band Ronnie Scott's week, so that I could make many of the points Ms Laine makes. I was turned down, presumably because Mr Dankworth was too busy ensuring his band turned in a world-class performance. </p> <p><b>Chris Parker</b><br>London N8 </p> <p>Cleo Laine hit the nail on the head. It is regrettable that, when the Arts Council of England ratified their Jazz Policy in 1996, they failed to allocate explicit resources. Although much good has been achieved, far more would have been, and can still be, made possible with an increased and 'earmarked' budget. </p> <p>Despite the good intentions of the Jazz Policy, jazz - with the same size of audience as opera - received a subsidy of 0.15 pence per head in 1995/96 rising to 0.29 pence per head in 1996/97, falling to 0.25 pence per head in 1999/2000. </p> <p>While not wanting to rob Pavarotti to pay Courtney Pine, this discrepancy, where a subsidy per attender of opera of \u00a312.07 per head in 1995/96 is rising to \u00a312.75 per head in 1999/2000, cannot be justified and still requires urgent adjustment. Despite this underfunding, jazz continues its success story in the United Kingdom. In 1997/98 research commissioned by the Arts Council showed that the percentage of adults in the UK who attended jazz concerts was 5.7 per cent. In 1999/2000 research shows this has risen to 6 per cent. It does not take much nous to work out what even a modest increase in funding for jazz could achieve.</p> <p><b>Chris Hodgkins</b><br>Jazz Services<br>London WC2 </p> <p>Cleo Laine's lament for British jazz artists hits several false notes. Compared with, say, 40 years ago there are far more UK jazz festivals - Edinburgh, Coventry and Cleethorpes highlight 95 per cent home-grown talent. Several independent record companies (Linn is a good example) promote British jazz. </p> <p>And this is not forgetting the array of venues, pubs and clubs (even the Wigmore Hall).

  "<p>The delicate, fine-boned woman in the silk Chanel blouse sitting quietly for her photographs in the elegant tea room of a London hotel is not at all what I expected. Naively, I had been picturing Sara Paretsky as her steely, fast-talking heroine, private investigator V. I. Warshawski; brash and tough, with fighting skills honed on the mean streets of Chicago's South Side. </p> <p>This soft-spoken, finely groomed woman with the neat, feathery hair doesn't look as if she often drops down empty lift shafts and flings herself on to the roof of moving trains, and of course there's no reason why she should, except that the detailed authenticity of her Warshawski books convince you that she must have lived at least some of it. But she shares with her character a determination and resilience that flashes sometimes in her quick eyes; like Warshawski - indeed, because of Warshawski - Paretsky knows what it's like to be a woman fighting her way through a man's world. </p> <p>Now that female detectives are almost de rigueur, and Paretsky's own books have over six million copies in print, it's difficult to imagine that only 20 years ago it was virtually unheard of for women to be writing hardboiled crime in the Raymond Chandler vein, and those who did were actively dissuaded from creating female protagonists.</p> <p>'If I hadn't been a crime fiction reader, I might never have tried to write for publication,' Paretsky says. 'Women didn't do that. But I got this bug that I wanted to have a woman detective, because I was so put off by the way women in crime fiction acted. Either they weren't there at all, or they would be total victims, or they'd be sexually active, so then you knew they were rotten to the core.' </p> <p>Paretsky has been working to fracture stereotypes of women since childhood. She grew up with her four brothers in rural Kansas, where her father was the first Jewish teacher to be hired by the university. 'We were like a family of giraffes,' she smiles. 'All the fundamentalist Christians wanted to come round and see if it was really true that we had little horns.'</p> <p>I ask if she felt isolated at school and she offers a little shrug. 'Sometimes, but not because of being Jewish - more because my parents were very contemptuous of ordinary social conventions.' Her parents were bookish and fond of music and Paretsky describes her mother as 'a phenomenal storyteller, much more inventive than I am,' which might have seemed an ideal environment to encourage an intelligent young woman. But after school, Paretsky encountered another glass ceiling to be broken through. </p> <p>'Although my parents were very progressive in their social and racial politics, they were very conservative in their sexual politics,' she says, slightly sadly but without bitterness. 'They had four boys to educate and they didn't think it was really worth educating girls, because they just get married and their education goes to waste. It was very hurtful at the time.' Instead of university, she was sent to secretarial school, but afterwards took a job as a dishwasher to fund herself through university; she went on to do a PhD in history and a master's in business. </p> <p>A summer of community service work in Chicago with deprived children ignited her obssession with the city that forms the backdrop to the Warshawski novels, and where Paretsky still lives with her husband. Warshawski came later, while Paretsky was working for a large insurance firm. </p> <p>'It was the fall of '78, and I was in a meeting with this guy who was really lethal and undermining all his subordinates - not just the women, he was evil to everyone who worked for him. And I suddenly thought, \"Here is my detective. She's a woman like me, but when she meets a guy like, I'll call him Fred, she doesn't worry about what to say. She's not afraid of getting fired or being nice, she just says whatever's in that balloon over her head, which we nice girls were brought up not to do\".' </p> <p>So she embarked on the first Warshawski novel, Indemnity Only, published in 1982. 'It took a long time to find a publisher - not only because I was a woman with a woman detective, but mainly because New York is so parochial, they thought no-one would read a novel about Chicago.' </p> <p>Paretsky is a woman with political ideals and a strong social conscience, unafraid to get her hands dirty with projects such as mentoring girls in inner-city schools or working with refugees. Her books tackle difficult issues, but she resists being described as a 'political' writer. 'Political fiction tends to be pretty dreary when it's trying to make a point. In a way I think my literary role model is Dickens,' she says, without a hint of self-consciousness, 'in that he was a great storyteller, but the stories came against the backdrop of the horrific social inequities that existed in London in the 1850s and that he had experienced first hand. </p> <p>'I think because it's always been such a struggle for me to find a voice and get people to listen to me, I am more focused on people who are voiceless. But storyline and characters absorb me much more than the political stuff.' Nevertheless, her tenth novel, Hard Time (Penguin \u00a35.99), its title a deliberate homage, has Warshawski confronting high-level corruption: abuses in the prison system, globalisation of the media, the exploitation of immigrant workers. </p> <p>'It really concerns me the way government is for sale these days, and the massive amounts of money companies can spend to buy the legislation they want. So if you don't have an independent press that is really diligent there's no way that abuses will be exposed or people called to account. So if your press is all owned by Hollywood studios, and these are the people who are giving a hundred million dollars a year to George Bush, then...' she spreads her hands out, indicating helplessness. </p> <p>If that makes the book sound worthy and heavy-going, fear not - she is quite right about story line taking precedence. Hard Time had me sitting up most of the night until I finished it. But it is a harrowing read in places, particularly in her exposure of the way women prisoners are treated. Although not allowed into women's prisons, she spent a lot of time talking to former prisoners and lawyers and there is a quiet anger and frustration in the book. </p> <p>'I felt angry, and I felt really powerless,' she says, with fierce eyes. 'The average age of a woman in an American prison is 20, 65 per cent are illiterate, 80 per cent are black or Hispanic. There's a tremendous amount of sexual assault and violence, and if the women complain they get put in solitary. It was hard for me to put V.I. behind bars because I like her to be in control, not to be that vulnerable where she got beaten up and nearly killed.' She pauses and looks thoughtful. 'I hope I never have to go to prison,' she says earnestly. 'I don't think I'd be strong enough, physically or mentally.' </p> <p>Perhaps not physically, but I would not doubt the strength of her mind. Paretsky is a fighter and you wouldn't want to be one of the bad guys.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Daring to Hope: the Diaries and Letters of Violet Bonham Carter</strong><br>edited by Mark Pottle<br>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson \u00a325, pp442<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501006273,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Is it possible to be smitten by a woman who died 31 years ago aged 81 simply through the diaries she wrote in the last two decades of her life? In the case of Violet Bonham Carter, the answer is yes. You feel yourself in the presence of a great woman, a woman of wit and cultivated discourse, passionately devoted to the Liberal principles she inherited from her father, H.H. Asquith, Prime Minister from 1908 until 1916, and utterly loyal to her family and friends. </p> <p>Her liberalism was principled, certainly, but it was perhaps more truly dynastic. Fidelity to her beloved father's memory and reputation was the mainspring of her life. Indeed, he had only one rival - Winston Churchill, whose declining years are one of the central themes of the diaries, the last of three volumes. Her husband Maurice Bonham Carter ('Bongy') gave her domestic happiness but Churchill was in other senses the love of her life. An entry for 1967 records the answer she gave to Kenneth Harris when he asked her before a television interview 'if she had been in love with Winston'. </p> <p>'I had not been in love - though I could not have loved him more - &amp; - our relationship was an intimacy of minds - &amp; words &amp; an emotional one.' </p> <p>It is perfectly truthful as far as it goes, but these diaries were written with an eye to posterity and are not fully confessional (the editor, Mark Pottle, has removed passages which would be hurtful to those still living). As Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, discloses in a perceptive and elegant introduction, Violet found some difficulty in accepting his marriage in 1908 to Clementine Hozier and was rather rude about her in letters and conversation. Eventually, they were reconciled and with good sense Clementine made no attempt to stand in the way of her friendship with her husband. </p> <p>The account of Churchill's twilight years is vivid and touching, but her affection makes her tolerant of his faults. He could be jealous of rivals and was unable to reciprocate Attlee's respect and liking, though his reluctance to hand over to Anthony Eden was fully justified by the botch his successor made of Suez. And this passionate opponent of racism and apartheid forgives her hero's racism as a minor blemish in a 'great tree' towering over all the rest in the political forest. </p> <p>The diaries are largely an account of an energetic public life in which her Liberal principles, uncontaminated by the exercise of power, burned with a kind of purity. With Churchill, she had opposed appeasement before the war; now with him she embraced the European movement and as the opportunities of boarding the European bus slipped by she lamented the loss of cohesion and pace. With him, she detested de Gaulle and the high tone of the diaries falters when she almost exults in his ill-health and imminent death. </p> <p>For all her devotion, she refused Churchill's repeated offers of an electoral pact, preferring a long electoral winter to the end of principle. For the Tories, Churchill apart, she entertained a genuine contempt. Instead, she poured her energies into helping her son-in-law, Jo Grimond, lead the party's hesitant revival that began with her son Mark's victory in the Torrington by-election of 1958. </p> <p>But the most important man in her life, until her death, remained her father. She was fiercely proud of his achievement, particularly in building the foundations of the welfare state, and scornfully dismissive of Lloyd George who supplanted him. And the diaries assume their only note of real personal distress, moments of personal bereavement apart, when she contemplates the proposed publication of 500 letters written by her infatuated father over three years from 1912 to her own close friend, Venetia Stanley (later Montagu). He abandoned the relationship after Venetia's marriage. </p> <p>Pottle deserves a special word - he is the Jeeves of editors, ever ready with a concise but helpful footnote, the master of the informative appendix. He edited the first two volumes with Mark Bonham Carter, who died in 1994, but was the sole midwife of the third. The result is once again a highly readable book, with narrative pace. </p> <p>For all her egalitarian and humanitarian principles, Violet Bonham Carter was a member of the old ruling caste, a toff. In 1961, after a lifetime of being driven about London, she returns from a performance of Beyond the Fringe. 'I got back by Tube from Holborn which I was rather proud of finding my way to.' </p> <p>Violet was not only clever, articulate, principled and brave; she was sweet, too.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dr Johnson's London </strong><br>Liza Picard<br>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson \u00a320, pp373<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502426915,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Samuel Johnson, though not a Londoner by birth, was a shameless advocate of the social advantages of city life. 'They who are content to live in the country are fit for the country,' he tutted; and it was his avowed opinion that 'the full tide of human existence' was to be found at Charing Cross. </p> <p>In this new survey of Johnson's London, which spans the years 1740 to 1770, Liza Picard reveals what it was that proved so compelling about the monstrous metropolis. She explores its glamorous thoroughfares, tawdry avenues and fetid byways, and in the process develops a detailed picture of what it must have been like to live in the eighteenth-century capital. Anatomising the different worlds of the rich, the poor and 'the middling sort', she attempts, in particular, to describe the existence of those whose rituals and routines have been overlooked by scholarly history. </p> <p>Picard prefers primary sources to modern distillations. Her previous book, Restoration London, drew heavily on Pepys's diaries. Where the eighteenth century is concerned, there is no such obvious point d'appui, but the period's addiction to print means that there is a wealth of materials, and data have been culled from both the expected sources (newspapers, periodicals) and the unexpected - such as the journal of Per Kalm, a Swedish botanist who came to London in 1748. The result is a cocktail of lustrous details and intimate reflection. Johnson himself does not loom especially large, but each part opens with an appropriate quotation from his 1755 Dictionary, perhaps less as a guide than a goad. </p> <p>Johnson speaks of London's 'wonderful immensity'; but though the period was marked by affluence and an affluent indulgence of grand projects, it is clear that eighteenth-century London was a city still chiefly residential. It was ill-designed, insanitary and enveloped by a mantle of pollution. One critic complained of 'serpentine narrow Streets, close, dismal, long Lanes, stinking Allies, dark, gloomy Courts and suffocating Yards'. The highway was choked with dirt - or rather, 'a rich, glutinous mixture of animal manure, dead cats and dogs, ashes, straw, and human excrement'. </p> <p>The novelist Tobias Smollett, a Scot at sea in this torrent of ordure, was scarcely more impressed with the city's bread, which he considered 'a deleterious paste mixed up with chalk, alum and bone-ashes, insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution'. Gin was frequently adulterated with turpentine, while fish were inflated in order to appear bigger (and fresher) than they really were. </p> <p>The London diet must have been a minefield for dyspeptics. A moderately prosperous family could consume up to 30lb of pepper in a year. Cods' heads, pigs' ears, larks on skewers, bottled peas, turtles, eels and snipe were all popular. There was even some affection for consuming turkey and apple pie - simultaneously. </p> <p>Yet health, it is clear, was much on Londoners' minds. Patients suffered while doctors grew rich. Many were prey to the allure of costly quackery, since hypochondria and complacency existed in curious sympathy. Cow dung fried in butter was known to be good for a sore breast; powdered roast mouse was thought a remedy for incontinence. False teeth could be obtained by post.</p> <p>Venereal disease, which was common on account of the inadequacy of contraceptives and the abundance of cheap prostitutes, was countered with heavy doses of mercury. The inefficacy of birth control procedures meant that coitus interruptus was widely practised: and this was casually known as 'making a coffee house of a woman's privities', since it required a man 'to go in and out and spend nothing'. </p> <p>The society Picard depicts seems riddled with an almost studious immorality. Pickpockets collaborated with itinerant ballad singers. Grave robbers and highwaymen rubbed shoulders. Beggars could hire children as theatrical props at the rate of fourpence a day. But their crimes were often brutally answered; those caught and found guilty could be subjected to mob vengeance, branding, public whipping, or a stint in the pillory. Worse, they could enter the Navy, which was permanently desperate for new recruits.</p> <p>The unpopular press gangs thought nothing of forcibly enlisting able-bodied males, and their notion of what it meant to be 'able-bodied' was distinctly flexible. On one occasion, observing that two large birds perched atop St Paul's Cathedral had drawn a crowd of sightseers, a notably enterprising gang placed a turkey on top of the monument in order to drum up a flock of potential conscripts.</p> <p>This was a society of unrepentant voyeurs and freak shows were therefore much in favour. In its first year, the British Museum received only 60 visitors, but the exhibition of a deformed child could pull in hordes. Visits to Bedlam to inspect the traits of insanity were still in vogue, and in April 1751 the Gentleman's Magazine was pleased to advertise the opportunity to view a centaur. </p> <p>Picard's account of such oddities is untouched by critical or political theory. But though at times old-fashioned, her book is in truth radically interested in satisfying simple questions about what London was like in its mid-eighteenth-century pomp. </p> <p>How did people live? What did they earn? What did they wear? The economics of daily life are mapped out closely. A penny bought enough gin to get drunk on; a shilling, a pound of Parmesan cheese; six shillings, a pound of opium; seven shillings, a dozen rabbits or a pair of strong shoes. A pound might buy a square yard of carpet, 12 French lessons, or a housemaid's services for two months. A prosperous tradesman's family could live on \u00a3350 a year, yet the lace on the Queen's state bed cost \u00a33,780 - in other words, enough for nearly a million people to get drunk. </p> <p>There emerges from Dr Johnson's London an impression of a society resolutely commercial and obsessed with commodities. Londoners were entranced by the sheer theatricality of their existence. Yet their world was larded with contradictions; self-watching and studied politesse were matched by visceral tastes and unabashed earthiness. With her keen eye for human quirks and human weakness, Picard brings the age's tortuous splendours and profound murkiness vividly to life, and does so with great verve and originality.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Snow and Guilt</strong><br>Giorgio Pressburger<br>Granta \u00a312.99, pp185<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502426111,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>'Choices, choices. There must be more to life than choices. But it seems to be the rule.' So complained the troubled Dr Friedmann in Giorgio Pressburger's short story 'Vera' from his first collection, The Law of White Spaces.</p> <p>Friedmann's complaint is the cri de coeur that echoes throughout Pressburger's extraordinary fiction, including his new collection of stories, Snow and Guilt. He is, as others have noted, a master of the compelling scenario, thrusting his characters, aching with their personal flaws, into dark moral conundrums. To love or not to love. To continue in a marriage that has become empty of passion or pursue the temptations of forbidden passion. To live an ordinary life with its accumulation of small betrayals, hypocrisy and guilt or to bow out. </p> <p>In The Law of White Spaces and Teeth and Spies, Pressburger showed an interest in the pathologies of the self viewed through through the prism of the physical condition. In Snow and Guilt, the pathology is of the spirit. He prefaces each story with a quotation from the Old Testament, and the title itself paraphrases Ezekiel: how snow, like guilt, covers all.</p> <p>It tells the story of four Jewish doctors climbing in the Alps who each attempt to parse the meaning of snow like guilt as they cross the pristine landscape. When three are killed in an avalanche, the fourth is consumed by his guilt at being alive, simply by virtue of choosing to walk ahead to lead his friends over dangerous terrain. </p> <p>But it is not the quote from Ezekiel that defines this story; it is the one from Genesis that opens the story: 'Do not interpretations belong to God?' The question of interpretation is one that troubles Pressburger. In the most powerful story in the collection, 'The Case of Professor Fleischmann', a scientist has an affair with a beautiful but deranged girl who pursues him to distraction, leading to a violent unravelling.</p> <p>During one encounter, she tries to persuade him that it is not her who is unwell: 'You're very ill. Let your spirit rest, calm down. Try to believe that life isn't an illusion and a lie as you believe, but something infinitely better, something with a secret meaning, and you're on earth to discover that secret. Your intelligence is ready to do it, your spirit isn't, your spirit is groping about in the darkness.' </p> <p>Pressburger's polished allegories of existence occupy a curious space in literature: modern in the existential nature of the crises they deal with, yet hinting at the possibility, at least, of age-old redemptions. His evocation of contemporary dislocation, that sometimes verges on madness, is reminiscent of Paul Auster's New York Trilogy. But for all his complexities and metaphysical speculations, Pressburger, born in Hungary and now resident in Italy, is a spellbinding storyteller. Indeed, he has already written the line that defines his own fiction better than any critic could. As his spy-narrator in Teeth and Spies explains: 'Our imagination can change the dimensions of the world, it can make reality disproportionate.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Gospel of Judas</strong><br>Simon Mawer<br>Little Brown \u00a315.99, pp256<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501583858,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>There are very good pragmatic reasons for giving up on metaphysics. Ever since Socrates toyed with Thrasymachus, philosophers have been seeking to apply a capital letter to the concept of truth, to locate what Larkin called 'the blind impress that all our behavings bear'. We have made so little progress and truth remains so much an article of faith that we might wonder whether the result is worth the expenditure. </p> <p>This search for authenticity, the quest for the ultimate truth, gives life to Simon Mawer's characters in his erudite and compelling new novel, The Gospel of Judas. Leo Newman, a lapsed Catholic priest, is asked to adjudicate on the authenticity of a papyrus scroll purporting to be the lost witness of the treacherous disciple. The text is a bomb under conventional Christian belief as it offers the only eyewitness account of the Resurrection. The plot leads, with the inexorability of the best thrillers, to the point where Leo has to decide whether or not to bear false witness to the truth he has discovered.The twists are surprising and genuinely tense. </p> <p>For this is a book in which nothing is quite the way it seems. The question mark of inauthenticity hangs over every character like a sword. Leo Newman himself was once Neumann. He is a Catholic priest with Jewish ancestry and, we learn, questionable parentage. He falls in love with, and loses his faith over, Madeleine, the wife of a diplomat, who turns out to be an unreliable witness, a direct parallel of her near namesake on whose witness of the Resurrection we still rely. The truths that Leo lives by are gradually unravelled, both professional and domestic. </p> <p>We are in a realm here where, usually unbeknown to them, characters are living in a present defined by a fictional history. Hence Leo's task at work neatly replays his own domestic drama. No world religion is more completely reliant on the veracity of its historical claims than Christianity. Its metaphysicians have always called in its historians as arbiters and Newman finds himself cast in this role. </p> <p>In the throes of an unsettling discovery of Madeleine's body and of his own, he is no position to discharge this duty. We are offered two routes to salvation, two possible answers in the search for authenticity: faith or love, spirit or body. For Leo, this is a choice. For him, love is a betrayal of his faith and he laments the lack of control he is able to exert over his own body as his erection seems to have a mind of its own. </p> <p>There is a great deal in this book. It is part an introduction to papyrological scholarship, part a discussion on the role of the witness in biblical history and part a meditation on the nature of truth and authenticity. For the most part, Mawer is in complete control of his material and the book is much less heavy going than it sounds. In fact, it is thrillingly readable. </p> <p>However, there are times when the author wears his learning rather heavily. The narrative pace occasionally slackens with a digression on etymology and Mawer's tendency to spin out cosmic significance from a small gesture calls to mind Kundera parodying himself. Sometimes, too, the author is tempted to be opaque and sententious. This is a shame because the book contains some beautiful writing: compare the straining 'the thread of contingency is inscrutable' with the telling description of Madeleine 'smiling into him rather than at him'. </p> <p>The moments when the reader finds himself in a tutorial rather than a novel are rare and it would be churlish to be too critical. The Gospel of Judas is like the legendary exam in which candidates were asked to set themselves a question and everyone set a task that was extraordinarily difficult and ambitious. Mawer has set himself a task of the greatest scope. He has set out to dramatise the question of truth, the most intractable question of all. </p> <p>We end with a piece of kitsch, which is a good pragmatic answer to the conundrum of truth. Why is it, wonders Newman, that magical powers are never ascribed to beautiful works of art? Why do people always see tears in the eyes of worthless pieces of kitsch? The answer is that people find their own truth. The disturbing message we take from this excellent novel is that this might just be as close as we ever get.</p>",
  "<p><strong> If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're so Rich?</strong><br>GA Cohen<br>Harvard \u00a323.30, pp240</p> <p>The Canadian political philosopher GA Cohen is unusual among Oxford professors and not just because he tends to preface his public performances with jokes, preferably Jewish, but because he was brought up in a working-class Communist home. His parents, Russian Jews, both worked on the factory floors in the Montreal garment industry. Cohen, born during the war, attended a Marxist primary school and Communist summer camps. </p> <p>As Cohen recounts here, he remained a Marxist far into adulthood. Indeed, moving to England to study philosophy, he became one of the leading members of a quixotic movement, 'analytical Marxism', that attempted to impart some clarity and rigour to the Communist cause. Over the past 10 or so years, he has finally abandoned that project, but not the commitment to social justice behind it.</p> <p>These nine engaging and searching lectures, an unorthodox mixture of intellectual autobiography and philosophical argument, fall into two parts. In the first, he describes the leading features of the Marxism in which he once believed. In the second, he explains why he remains critical of the sort of left-wing liberalism that would seem to be Marxism's natural alternative. </p> <p>Marx and Engels taught their followers to scorn all forms of moralising socialism. They argued that capitalism was bound to collapse of its own economic contradictions and that the abundance that would reign in the new, post-capitalist era would render questions of distributive justice irrelevant. The historic task of the socialist movement, then, was not to convert people to a socialist ethics, but merely but to act as a 'midwife' to a revolution that was inevitable. </p> <p>The collapse of capitalism, of course, never came and the promise of a world of abundance looks certain to remain unmet; if nothing else, there are, we now know, environmental limits to growth. Contra Marx, we clearly need, as the non-Marxists Left has always argued, to take justice seriously. And yet there is, Cohen argues, one central respect in which liberal egalitarians hardly take justice any more seriously than Marxists did. </p> <p>For liberals, even left-wing ones, have become enthusiastic exponents of inequality. They insist on the importance of a constitution guaranteeing civil and political rights and equality of opportunity and they argue for a redistributive tax structure, but they also claim that everyone benefits if, within these legal limits, people pursue economic self-interest. We have got used to left-wing politicians praising rich businessmen as 'wealth producers'. </p> <p>There are some cases in which self-interested conduct is entirely compatible with fairness. In tennis, for instance, we expect players to respect the rules of the game but to compete to win. In a court of law, defence and prosecution strive to outmanoeuvre each other. But, Cohen argues, these are not good models for the economy as a whole, for a simple reason: those with most talents or other marketable qualities can hold the less blessed to ransom. In Germany, industrial bosses take home perhaps 10 times what their workers earn, but in America, with its more individualistic, free-market ethos, they take home much more. This indicates that just institutions and self-interested conduct are not enough; justice also requires an egalitarian ethos. </p> <p>Cohen also points to another weakness in the liberal armoury. Rich egalitarians rarely give away their money - or as much of it as would be taken by an egalitarian state. Again, they justify themselves by arguing that justice is a matter of just institutions, not personal conduct. Again, there are cases where this argument holds: there is no point in sticking to the rules of tennis unless the rules are respected. But here, too, the argument does not quite carry over. On the contrary, Cohen contends, if you are an egalitarian, then there is no justification for waiting for the establishment of fair institutions. Consistency seems to demand that you give away your wealth now. </p> <p>So Cohen has moved from a 'hard' to a 'soft' position. He can now see the point not only of Marx but of Jesus.</p>",
  "<p>A disappointing start for newly promoted Dunfermline. They had Gordon Petrie carried off with a suspected broken leg against St Johnstone, and were held to a 1-1 draw despite having had the boost of being a goal ahead and the visitors reduced to 10 men through John Paul McBride's late sending-off. </p> <p>Both goals came from penalties, with Steve Crawford converting his spot-kick for a foul on him by Jim Weir on the stroke of half-time, and Graeme Jones doing likewise after 51 minutes after a foul on McBride by Michael Doesburg. </p> <p>Crawford had the best Dunfermline chance to get a second, heading over with the goal at his mercy. But St Johnstone, the more dangerous of the two teams, could easily have got another two themselves. </p> <p> Manchester City received a chill warning a week ahead of the new Premiership season as they were comprehensively beaten 3-1 in their warm-up match at Everton. </p> <p>Walter Smith's side proved too strong for the top-flight new boys as summer signings Niclas Alexandersson and Alex Nyarko engineered their downfall, with Paul Gascoigne on his Goodison Park debut turning in a pleasing cameo performance as a second-half substitute. </p> <p>Alexandersson put the home side two up before departing prematurely through injury and Nyarko added a third before Sean Wright-Phillips gave the scoreline some respectability for Joe Royle's men. </p> <p>The game was organised as a testimonial for former Everton midfielder Joe Parkinson, whose career was cut short by a knee injury, and while the Goodison favourite received a rapturous welcome from a crowd of 21,596 as he joined the fray for the last 14 minutes, this was as competitive a friendly as could be at this late stage of pre-season. </p> <p>Ironically, it was City who could have taken the game by the scruff of the neck in the early stages as former World Footballer of the Year George Weah led David Unsworth and David Weir a merry dance. However, the home side took the lead against the run of play, and from that point they never looked back. </p> <p>As for Gazza, it was from his 47th-minute corner that the impressive Nyarko controlled Pembridge's shot before cheekily back-heeling the ball past Weaver to make it 3-0. </p> <p>Ipswich's star in their 1-1 draw against Fiorentina was their 19-year-old central defender, Titus Bramble. </p> <p>In addition to his outstanding defensive work, he delighted a crowd of 11,329 when he appeared at the far post to head home a free-kick from Jim Magilton after Jermaine Wright had been fouled just outside the penalty area in the 37th minute. </p> <p>Another Ipswich hero was England's number three goalkeeper, Richard Wright, who looked sharp and confident after settling his immediate future by signing a new two-year deal with the club. </p> <p>Coventry, without five first-choice players because of injury, established a 1-0 lead at home to Ajax through their Belgian striker Cedric Roussel, but ended up losing 3-1. </p> <p>Still, one encouraging thought for Coventry's manager, Gordon Strachan, is that only when he started giving his substitutes a taste of the action did Ajax put the ball in the net. </p> <p>Richard Witschge, who had dictated the midfield play, got the equaliser in the 65th minute when Tomas Galasek cut the ball back from the goalline. </p> <p>Then, in the 80th minute, substitute Brutil Hose scored within seconds of running on and the final goal was scored with the last kick of the match by another substitute, Cedric Van Der Gun.</p>",
  "<p>Children taught at home significantly outperform their contemporaries who go to school, the first comparative study has found.</p> <p>It discovered that home-educated children of working-class parents achieved considerably higher marks in tests than the children of professional, middle-class parents and that gender differences in exam results disappear among home-taught children.</p> <p>The study, to be published by the University of Durham in the autumn, will support a call for the Government to introduce legislation to help the growing army of parents who are choosing to remove their children from schools. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/unschool-children-monitor-home-schooling-education\">Rise of the home \u2018unschoolers\u2019  \u2013 where children learn only what they want to</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The number of home-educated children in Britain has grown from practically none 20 years ago to about 150,000 today - around 1 per cent of the school age population. By the end of the decade, the figure is expected to have tripled. Home education has won so much support in Scotland that more than 200 campaigners from across Britain are to march to the Scottish Parliament next month to demand a relaxation in legislation which makes it harder for parents to educate their children at home in Scotland than in England and Wales. </p> <p>\u2018Home-educated children do better in conventional terms and in every other way too,\u2019 said Paula Rothermel, a lecturer in learning in early childhood at the University of Durham, who spent three years conducting the survey. She said: \u2018This study is the first evidence we have proving that home education is a huge benefit to large numbers of children. Society just assumes that school is best but because there have never been any comparative studies before this one, the assumption is baseless.\u2019 </p> <p>Rothermel questioned 100 home-educating families chosen randomly across the UK, conducting face-to-face interviews and detailed appraisals of their children\u2019s academic progress, in line with recognised Government tests. She found that 65 per cent of home-educated children scored more than 75 per cent in a general mathematics and literacy test, compared to a national figure of only 5.1 per cent. The average national score for school-educated pupils in the same test was 45 per cent, while that of the home-educated children was 81 per cent. </p> <p>Rothermel said: \u2018The improved exam results could be down to the sheer quantity of parental attention and the sense of long-term security that gives them... It could also be down to the fact that families who home educate from birth had worked with their children from the word go and without the disruptive transition at an early age to the very different environment of school.\u2019 </p> <p>Rothermel found that the children of working-class, poorly-educated parents significantly outperformed their middle-class contemporaries. While the five- to six-year old children of professional parents scored only 55.2 per cent in the test, children far lower down the social scale scored 71 per cent. Rothermel said: \u2018This was really a staggering finding, but better-educated parents are probably more laid back than poorly-educated parents and so are less likely to push their children.\u2019 </p> <p>Alison Preuss, a mother of three, has been home teaching for six years and is director of Schoolhouse, a Scottish support group for parents who have opted out of conventional schooling. She said: \u2018In school [children] have knowledge poured into them, while at home they\u2019re proactive in choosing what they learn. It\u2019s a better preparation for university because they are used to motivating themselves. </p> <p>\u2018Their social skills and general knowledge are more advanced because they\u2019re not restricted by the confines of a national curriculum. They can explore a huge variety of subjects, concentrating in depth on whichever ones capture their imagination.\u2019</p>",
  "<p>Of the Premiership teams who yesterday warmed up for the start of their season with matches against high-profile foreign opposition, Ipswich produced arguably the best performance, against Fiorentina. At least they did not lose. </p> <p>On top of that, their 1-1 draw against the Italian Serie A side thrust another of their home-produced youngsters into the spotlight. The name is Titus Bramble, a 19-year-old central defender who prevented Ipswich going behind in the 23rd minute with a perfectly timed tackle on Paolo Vanoli and delighted the 11,329 crowd by heading the opening goal from a Jim Hamilton free-kick 14 minutes later. </p> <p>No less prominent was Ipswich's goalkeeper, Richard Wright, who pulled off three excellent saves. But even he could do nothing about Fiorentina's 47th-minute equaliser from Marco Rossi. </p> <p>Southampton went down 2-1 to Real Sociedad - through a controversial penalty - while Coventry were beaten 3-1 by Ajax. Although Coventry were without five first-choice players because of injury - Carlton Palmer, David Thompson, Marc Edworthy, Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo - they did manage to open the scoring through Cedric Rousel. </p> <p>The goal, after just six minutes, was something of a gift by the Ajax defence; and from that point Coventry found it difficult to get the ball, let alone create further chances. </p> <p>Still, one encouraging thought for their manager, Gordon Strachan, was that it was only when he started to give his substitutes a taste of the action that Ajax, who were also not slow to bring on fresh faces from the bench, were able to start getting the ball in the net. </p> <p>Robert Witschge, who had dominated the midfield, scored the equaliser in the 65th minute, and Ajax seized control in the last 10 minutes through Brutil Hose and Cedric Van Der Gun. </p> <p>While Ipswich were giving a reasonable account of themselves as new members of the Premiership elite, Manchester City - who seem the likeliest of the three promoted teams to hold their own at this level - suffered a 3-1 defeat at Everton. </p> <p>The game, organised as a testimonial for the former Everton midfielder Joe Parkinson and watched by a crowd of 21,596, was highlighted initially by the skills of City's former World Player of the Year George Weah. However, it was Everton who took the lead after four minutes, thanks to Niclas Alexandersson, and they never really looked back. </p> <p>In addition to Alexandersson and Alex Nyarko, who scored the other Everton goals, Paul Gascoigne also caught the eye with an exciting cameo performance as a substitute. </p> <p>Portsmouth are as good an outside bet as any to reach the Premiership this season, according to Barnsley's manager, Dave Bassett. However, as Portsmouth went down 2-0 at Sheffield United, it was just as well that he added: 'If I knew who was going to do what, I would be a millionaire with my feet up in Las Vegas.' </p> <p>Perhaps his own team are the best bet. Their defender Carl Regan, who was signed from Everton, was sent off on his debut against Norwich for a two-footed lunge on Daryl Sutch. But Barnsley, whose promotion dream last season was destroyed in the play-off final, went on to win 1-0 through a goal by another debutant, Lee Jones. </p> <p>Of the newly-promoted teams Preston, Peterborough and Kidderminster got off to perfect starts in their new environments with wins; Swansea, Northampton and Burnley had to settle for draws; and Gillingham and Rotherham lost. </p> <p>Gillingham went down 3-1 at home to Stockport, after being a goal ahead. It was even worse for Rotherham, who were 2-0 ahead against Walsall but crashed 3-2.</p>",
  "<p>The English Premier League is the best in the World. We know that because Richard Keys says so and will be reminding us live on Sky Sports 1,2,3 and digital at least twice a week for the next ten months. </p> <p>Forgotten will be that awful evening in Charleroi when England's best left back, Phil Neville, demonstrated the tackling skills of a pub player. However I've still been imagining what might have happened if Neville could tackle like an Italian just as I've been left to imagine 'what might have been' so many times before. Suddenly I realised that the real problem with the England team must be me. I bring them bad luck every time they play. This time though tragedy turned to farce as we all witnessed the failure of our lads even to pass the ball to someone else in an England shirt. No, I couldn't possibly be blamed for that rubbish though I was not one of the many pundits who delight in knocking the England team and who were pleased to see England knocked out in the first round to 'save being embarrassed by the Italians.' </p> <p>At least the Italians in Euro 2000 did have one thing in common with the English. Virtually every player plays in their domestic league. So why then are the Italians so much better than us when only last season Richard Keys was telling us how bad Serie A was because none of their teams reached the semi-finals of the Champions League? </p> <p>Lying here in Tuscany on an Italian beach reading about Lazio's \u00a3100m worth of summer signings I think I have one of the answers. There is a game of beach football going on and the English lad joining in, matches the Italians in almost every department. Apart from the fact he looks like a lobster you can tell he is English because he doesn't collapse in a heap every time he's tackled. But the big difference is that the Italian boys are trying to impress the watching girlies with their silky skills and here naturally they succeed. They certainly impress me and every one of them has more technical control than Gary and Phil Neville put together. West Ham's Joe Cole would feel at home here. The problem is that Cole can't even get a game for the England under 21s because Harold Wilkinson doesn't think he is ready yet. It's pointless kidding ourselves that the Premier League is the best when it clearly isn't. It never will be so long as we have people like Wilkinson running our game who prefer cloggers to artists. </p> <p>Despite our bitter disappointment over England's performance in Euro 2000 most English fans can't wait for the new season to start. Having forked out nearly \u00a3800 for my season ticket only to be told that I can return it and have my money back because Spurs have sold their only player capable of decent football I shouldn't be looking forward to the new season at all but I am. This the best time of year for all fans who like me who know their team will win nothing but can fantasise about the season ahead. Indeed on our pre-season drinking training session the other day and, after six pints of Guinness, Spurs were definitely going to challenge for the League and win the FA Cup. </p> <p>We talk such rubbish because we all love our team even though we know they are crap. We all know that the Premier League is not the best in the world but like Millwall fans, we don't care. We know that the Premier League is for clapped out foreigners on the make but, again, we don't care. We all know that Manchester United will win the League again but will still put \u00a320 on our team to win the League at 50-1. I've put \u00a330 on Spurs to win the Cup and if you could have a pound every time you hear or read a pundit say that Spurs will win the FA Cup because the year ends in a 'one' you would earn as much as a Premier League player. If they do win it I'll be happy because the FA Cup is the best cup competition in the world. I know this because ITV's Desmond Lynam told us. Next year the BBC's Gary Lineker will be telling us but Des won't because he will be agreeing with Richard Keys.</p>",
  "Not before time, the Government tackles the prime destroyer of peace in the community. The chainsaws are out for leylandii hedging. No issue more preoccupies his correspondents, says Michael Meacher, whose Ministerial postbag is fat with letters recording 'thousands of ruined lives, legal battles and violence'. One presumes that few of these are post-marked Portsmouth, where the bricks, petrol bombs and screams of loathing unleashed by neighbours take precedence over horticultural hell. <p>And what is the Government going to do about that as the Paulsgrove estate subsides into uneasy truce? Mums set aside the disco Lycra essential for telegenic promotion of hanging and castration. Children abandon the 'Kill The Paedophile' placards adorned with smiley faces. So far, the countrywide scoreline in the game of hunt the pervert is two suicides, one injured policeman, various burned and smashed homes and an own goal by the judge who gave a suspended sentence to a sex offender on the grounds that he had suffered enough after being named by the News of the World . Then there is the collateral damage - the innocents hounded from their homes, the paedophiles driven underground, the children initiated into a creed of hatred. </p> <p>As marches were suspended, the move began, in bien pensant circles, to explain away the Paulsgrove mob as a shell-suited, tattooed, hamburger-munching sorority whose neighbour-bashing is rooted in a low-life culture barely explicable to genteel folk who restrict their raw emotions to squeaks of leylandii rage. That comfortingly snobbish explanation will not quite do. Nor is there much use in trawling the history of lynch mobs from the Kishinev pogrom to the Ku Klux Klan for further guidance. While Portsmouth 2000 eerily evokes Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, recent precedents are more relevant. </p> <p>The dress rehearsal for last week's events was staged in April 1998, when the child killer, Sydney Cooke, was released from prison. Petrol bombs were hurled at the police station where he was believed to be sheltering. Dozens of officers were injured and probation officers warned that paedophiles would be driven underground as vigilantes clamoured for the sex offenders register, then newly introduced, to be made public. </p> <p>If the Home Office heeded this preview, they gave little indication. On the day that the News of the World launched its perilous 'name and shame' campaign, Paul Boateng expressed the sort of mild thumbs-down more appropriate to a member of a sampling panel assessing rival brands of teabag. His belated announcement, after the newspaper backed off , that there would be no open register only inflamed the hysteria that child-abuse scares inevitably foster. </p> <p>Track back to the late Eighties and early Nineties. In Middlesbrough, social services seized 121 children after Dr Marietta Higgs and her colleague, Dr Geoffrey Wyatt, mistakenly claimed to have uncovered an epidemic of sexual abuse. In Rochdale and Orkney, families were broken up by social workers gripped by the voguish (and wholly misplaced) terror of satanic abuse. The upshot, beyond the millions expended on public inquiries, was unquantifiable damage to children and all-round vilification of the vigilantes - interfering and authoritarian zealots in white coats and cable-knit cardigans. So much for the current theory that child-abuse cultism is the sole province of the oikish lower classes. </p> <p>But why the new witchhunt? The direct catalysts, of course, were the murder of Sarah Payne, whose parents plead now for an end to violence, and the News of the World . Behind that lies a political climate overtly or subvertly conducive to DIY justice. William Hague is explicit in his desire to lock up all asylum-seekers and to champion those who shoot fleeing teenage burglars. The Jack Straw mood music has naturally been more mellifluous. He wishes, as he repeated last week, for 'victims to feel that they are at the heart of the criminal justice system'. In recent months, Straw's initiatives have been sugared to appeal to those on the receiving end of crime. Curbing trial by jury will, to take one example, offer quicker justice and thus be a boon to victims. But skewing an impartial system away from defendants' rights is perilous. However subtle Straw's signals, they risk playing to a public appetite for victim-driven law, dictated by the grief of the bereaved. Any foot-dragging, and the clamour kicks in. </p> <p>If Home Office Ministers had been wiser, they would have pre-empted the incorrect notion that Britain is a perverts' playground. There may be an argument for tougher sentencing. There is certainly a need for more information on how paedophiles are treated and supervised. There is a case for splitting the sex offenders register so that child rapists are not listed alongside teenage boys who have had consensual sex with 15-year-old girlfriends. Even so, the register works better than in many countries. Most child abuse takes place at home, even, possibly, in the moral temples of the Paulsgrove estate. Risk, though it may be better managed, cannot be abolished. But that is not what the Home Office dares say, nor what the public wants to hear. </p> <p>The mood is for justice or for vengeance. We shall see shortly how the two conflate. Today, in some unnamed secure unit, Jon Venables, the older of the two Bulger killers, reaches his eighteenth birthday. Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had hoped by now to have set a final tariff for Venables and Robert Thompson, who will be 18 in ten days' time. Woolf, who also favours victims' involvement - not, he says, as auxiliary prosecutors but in order to build public confidence in the criminal justice system - has now been held up twice because James Bulger's parents have not yet filed their submissions. It was reported last week that he would reach his decision by the end of August. In fact, it is unlikely to be delivered before Octo ber. The rival positions, however, seem clear. Denise Fergus, James's mother, believes, understandably, that 'the boys are evil and deserve to spend time in a proper jail'. Woolf, conversely, is thought to favour a 10-year term, expiring in 2003 and no move to an adult prison. The public verdict is not yet readable, but the history of the Bulger killers has no track record of inspiring clemency. </p> <p>Last October, Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, told me that he believed Thompson and Venables should be freed as soon as possible after their eighteenth birthdays 'in order to give them some chance of making a life'. In so exceeding his remit on a matter he deemed a 'question for society', Ramsbotham no doubt expected a rap over the knuckles and perhaps even the public apology he was required to make. Instead, he faced not only removal but the abolition of his job. Last week, official plans were published to merge the probation and the prisons watchdogs, thus absolving Jack Straw of further embarrassment from any stroppy chief inspector complaining of vile and inhumane conditions in British prisons. </p> <p>Ramsbotham's point, on the Bulger killers, was that it would be folly to place two boys - apparently rehabilitated and well-educated - back into such a system. 'I would not wish them to go to some of the places I have seen,' he said. We shall find out shortly whether the public is so merciful. We shall see also whether the spectre of Paulsgrove - the bloodlust, the hatred, the horrible scenes of toddlers with coffin-shaped posters inscribed 'Get In or Get Out' - has changed anything in the national psyche. </p> <p>If there is widespread acceptance of Lord Woolf's expected verdict, then perhaps some corner has been turned. The revulsion at the spectacle of rioters baying for punishment and revenge offers hope that may be so. Still, it would be over-optimistic to assume that the 'deep and darkling forces' that brought Salem to Portsmouth were merely a rogue expression of social discontent. </p> <p>Behind the leylandii hedges of Middle England, many deplore the Paulsgrove padeophile-bashers while tapping into their professed anxieties. If the Government cannot now calm reasonable fears, then it will face the upsurge of the brutish and the irrational.</p>",
  "Building a state is a monumental, precarious and rarely peaceful business. Even some states we now consider natural parts of the landscape are recent creations which have stood on the edge of disintegration within living memory. Losing the colonial war in Algeria nearly brought France to its knees. From South Korea to Argentina, Greece to Egypt, it's a similar story. The panoply of flags, rule of law, orderly changes of government, civil peace and relative economic stability are all recent and hard-won achievements. And although it is now lost in the sands of time, Britain, too, had its share of civil war, murder and division before the contemporary British state emerged at the end of the seventeenth century. <p>It is in this context that Vladimir Putin, this week celebrating his first year in office as first Prime Minister and latterly as President, should be judged. In the West, Putin is now seen as the butcher of Chechnya, the ex-KGB stooge with a scant regard for democracy, liberty and market economics, whatever lip service he pays to its principles. As he appoints his old security friends to key Ministries and offices, we should be wary of another instinctive authoritarian rebuilding his power base in Russia. We should hold our noses and keep our distance. Putin is the next Pinochet. </p> <p>But has the West been misreading the Russian leader? Cast Putin as a state builder, the necessary if insufficient precondition to establishing a successful capitalism in Russia, and you start to see him in a different light. Moreover, he begins his endeavours from a disastrous starting point. Russia moved from a crumbling Tsarist structure to an authoritarian police state in one jump. After its collapse, there is no system of contract and property law; no impartial bureaucracy or judiciary; no common glue holding civil society together; little sense of governmental legitimacy. </p> <p>He is constructing a state on a site where the old, corrupt outgrowths of communism still flourish and in a country with more than 100 ethnic groups, some of whom, like the Chechens, do not accept any authority or legitimacy beyond their ethnic boundaries. </p> <p>The often forgotten advantage of communism was that, whatever its massive failings, it did offer a unifying ideology to a part of Euro-Asia otherwise riven by vicious ethnic hatreds. Tito, for example, never accepted the economistic interpretation of communism that implied no role for markets or private enterprise; he expressly ran Yugoslavia as a mixed economy. For him, communism was the perfect political doctrine for holding a fissile, ethnically divided community together; ethnic cleansing was ideologically outlawed. </p> <p>Many professional middle-class Russians took the same view about the Soviet Union. At least communism kept the ethnic menace at bay and could hold the country together effectively. The endless parades in 1945, piling up German battle standards in Red Square, were a self-conscious repetition of what Tsar Alexander had done after victory over Napoleon, propagandising communism's effectiveness as a substitute for an orthodox state. </p> <p>The events of the last decade amply justify the fears about Russia's governability. The small army of ideological free-market economists who argued that the sole preconditions for a successful capitalism were private property and flexible prices were not simply economically na\u00efve, they were political innocents who had forgotten their history. Of course, in the absence of a strong centre and no cultural, ethnic or political reason to be loyal to Moscow, the governors in Russia's cities, provinces and federal regions would spend money like water to keep their restless, poverty-stricken and ethnically diverse populations happy without collecting taxes, the heart of the still massive government budget deficit and proximate cause of the high and volatile inflation rate. </p> <p>And, of course, capitalism in a state that could not offer even relative price stability, impartial justice, trustworthy banks and the rule of law would quickly collapse into quasi-banditry. Add the ghastly economic legacy of communism, with its massive inefficiencies, and the whole cocktail was likely to deliver what it has - economic collapse and a vacuum of political authority on a titanic scale. On one calculation, 80 per cent of businesses and 60 per cent of the state are said to be corrupt; even those figures could be an underestimate. In this respect, the infamous 'oligarchs', the Mafia-style bosses who dominate Russia's business through gangsterism, are as much the symptom as the cause of Russia's ills. </p> <p>Putin not only understands all this, he says so openly and is acting to correct it. His state-of-the-nation address to the Duma last month was astonishingly frank. The Russian government and state processes are the principal causes of 'raging corruption', the outflow of capital and the 'dictatorship of the black economy', he said. What was impeding economic growth were the twin enemies of criminal business and corrupt officialdom. Yet there was no going back to a command economy and communism. The only way forward was capitalism, but, paradoxically, that required strong political authority at the centre, an authority that would be strengthened rather than weakened by free media scrutiny, the rule of law, democratic competition and impartial administration. Who can disagree? </p> <p>Putin is acting extraordinarily bravely in the circumstances. He has appointed seven federal super-governors charged with curbing the autonomy and spending of 89 provincial and regional political bosses. This is not just a political but an economic necessity as their spending now constitutes 40 per cent of all public spending. On top, he has insisted that all taxes should be collected centrally, a privilege which the regional governors guarded jealously against all Yeltsin's efforts but which they have now ceded to Putin. No concession at this juncture on autonomy was ever possible to the Chechens; it would have undermined the entire effort to re-engineer the Russian state. </p> <p>Having concentrated tax-raising powers in the centre, he has signalled he intends to exploit his new authority. A fortnight ago, he held his infamous meeting with 21 leading 'oligarchs' in which he read the riot act - there could be no more tax avoidance, no more shipping money abroad and no more doing deals by literally holding a gun to people's heads. Already, he grimly warned them, he had permitted the temporary arrest of Vladimir Gusinsky, a Murdoch-style media mogul and challenged Boris Berezovsky, the businessman closest to Yeltsin. More would follow. Last Thursday, as good as his word, Russian tax police raided the headquarters of the giant oil company Sibneft, run by another of the oligarchs close to Yeltsin and hitherto untouched. </p> <p>All this is to serve a 10-year plan of economic reform, sequencing investment first in manufacturing and later in high-tech industries, raising growth, curbing inflation and cutting the budget deficit. The plan, modelled on what the Japanese and South Koreans have done, is criticised by free marketeers as too statist, but as their advice has been so calamitous they have little or no credibility. Yet even to get near achieving it, Putin is having to reconstruct a state; he's showing every sign of possessing the vision and nerve to pull it off. </p> <p>Tony Blair has been derided for so quickly offering his support, but he is right. Putin has his warts and he has yet to prove his commitment to media freedom, human rights and genuine democracy. Yet he is doing what has to be done within extraordinary constraints and in an extraordinary environment. We need him to succeed.</p>",
  "The appliers of political science had no doubt about it. At universities across America, they fed all the relevant data about the economy, wealth, jobs and crime into their computers - and produced an overwhelming verdict. Hail President Gore! An open-and-shut case. But now the computers themselves are shutting down. <p>The presidential race rates as high summer horror. The nation is on heatwave holiday, drifting between barbecue and beach, manifestly uninterested in politics. TV viewing figures for the Republicans in Philadelphia were sharply down on 1996: the big turn-off proceeds exponentially over decades. </p> <p>Yet modern history also says that the candidate who leads the polls on Labour Day weekend at the start of September is the candidate who wins in November. Only Ronald Reagan, 20 years ago, bucked that law - and whatever else Al Gore is, he ain't no Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>The Vice-President comes to Los Angeles this week trailing a cautiously triumphant George W. Bush on every one of those polls, usually by more than 10 points. The convention is his only realistic chance of getting back into contention. Either he begins to transform the way America sees him - warm, not chilly; interesting, not boring; human, not policy wonkish; Al, not Bill - or he will be the pre-ordained loser. </p> <p>No easy brief. I have, as it happens, met Gore twice. One time (an interview) he couldn't have been more superciliously brusque. Southern charm? Forget it. He could hardly bother to move his lips. And the other time (in Boston this spring) he kept an international conference waiting for half an hour while he slotted in unscheduled TV appearances in the back lobby. His record for failing to win friends is richly deserved. </p> <p>Is Clinton-Gore the problem, as the Republicans would have us believe? Are 'dignity' and 'honour' the buzz words for success? The funniest thing of all in the polls is the way that the supposedly reviled Clinton, now peddling New Penitence like a stomach powder, still coasts along with 60 per cent approval ratings, while the man who didn't touch Monica Lewinsky - or fib about it - is 20 or so points behind that. Gore has an effusively loving wife, an adoring family, and Southern morality to spare: but, for the moment, he is also the issue. His policy platform isn't popular: but he is less popular still. </p> <p>So to the Los Angeles personality transplant ward. Al has been taking the pre-med tablets already, voyaging relentlessly to hometown meetings in Carthage, Tennessee, with his new friend Joe Lieberman and three dozen camera crews to meet grey-haired women who remember him as a lovable guy. His collar is ritually unbuttoned these days, jacket cast aside. He's regular and relaxed and (not for the first time) re-made. </p> <p>How will it play in LA? The selection of Senator Lieberman as his running mate may not be enthusing the big donors of Hollywood, but otherwise it went down well. Lieberman arrives on the main screen as a 'moderate' beloved on both sides of the Senate (a word reserved for Mr Conservative in-betweens). Most of the attention may have concentrated on his Orthodox Jewry - and the blonde second wife whose parents escaped a Nazi concentration camp - but he has one attribute beyond mere history. He's a politician who answers the question: a pearl beyond media price. </p> <p>Ask Senator Joey (as his wife calls him, to winces off) why he doesn't follow the Gore line on education vouchers - or, more difficult - whether he intends to run for the Senate as well as the vice-presidency, and he'll give you a straightforward, thoughtfully clear response. The human being bit comes naturally. </p> <p>This is not altogether good news for Gore. Lieberman is on the ticket because his was the first sombre voice to speak out against sex in the Oval Office. He's a formal break with the sleaze of the past. But he also possesses the vital attribute his master lacks. He couldn't be wooden if he tried. </p> <p>It is one of the great curiosities of this election that both main candidates now have putative Vice-Presidents who, on any normal count, are better - more knowledgeable, more sentient, less mechanical - than they are themselves. The Veeps look better than the Prezzas. And neither of them, disasters aside, has any real chance of being President themselves. Time and age are against them. </p> <p>Gore is the Democratic contender now because he wasn't as good as Bill Clinton then. He inherited rather than won the nomination. He has, thus far, lacked any clear strategy - trapped between attacking the Republicans and defending a dying administration. </p> <p>Now he has to stand in his own right. He has to deliver the assets the computers have stored. Now he has to win a few hearts - or, at the least, show that he has one.</p>",
  "Do they still teach in school the dates when the Bastille fell, the Winter Palace was stormed, Charles I was be-headed or the American Declaration of Independence proclaimed? If so, there is another date to add - the moment communism was pushed gently into the dustbin of history. <p>It happened in Poland 20 years ago this month when, for the first time, a Communist government had to sign a democratic contract with the representatives of the people. With historic inevitability there followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the final dismantling of twentieth-century Soviet rule. </p> <p>I met Lech Walesa and his lieutenants and questioned the workers and democratic activists who paved the way for August 1980 by their work in the Seventies. I spoke at Solidarity meetings, travelled through Poland, went into shipyards and mines. </p> <p>Now, 20 years later, I returned to Poland to talk with Walesa and see what had happened to the men and women who made that revolution whose anniversary will hardly be noticed - so quickly has European communism faded from memory. </p> <p>How can I explain to my children what it was like - the dreariness of the streets, the rotten flats with ill-fitting windows that let in Siberian winds, the emptiness of the bookshops, the long queues outside shops, the fear of informers, the stifling weight of bureaucracy, the learning-by-rote of distorted history and the endless desire to leave your country? </p> <p>During long talks with Walesa in Gdansk 20 years ago I was struck by his odd mixture of religiosity and shop-steward chippiness - at times Arthur Scargill, at others Mother Teresa. The creator of communism's first mass independent trade union smoked incessantly and his words gushed out in a torrent. On the wall of his tiny office in Gdansk hung a Polish eagle and a crucifix. </p> <p>Walesa did not initiate the strike of August 1980. The management of the Lenin Shipyard fired Anna Walentynowicz, a crane driver who was always hassling the bosses over wages and conditions and, worse, demanding a memorial for protesting workers shot dead by militia in the Seventies. </p> <p>Little groups of angry workers met and put up posters. Tension rose as managers pulled them down. It was a standoff until a small, stocky electrician who had climbed over the shipyard wall got up on a crate. He said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, you know me, Lech Walesa. I was fired from here for making the same protests as Anna. This time we will make sure she keeps her job.' </p> <p>It was 14 August 1980. Walesa's stroke of genius was to tell everyone to stay inside the shipyard. There were no demonstrations to be shot at, no picket lines to be attacked. </p> <p>Today's Walesa's hair is grey, his body stockier. He still wears the badge of the Black Virgin of Czestochowa and the words still gush out as if the events of August 1980 happened yesterday. </p> <p>The struggle, which began in the Seventies, could have gone on for 50 years. 'But we had a gift from heaven - Pope John Paul II. Until he became Pope, I had 10 people in an independent union in Gdansk. After John Paul, I had 10 million.' </p> <p>Yet Walesa, workers and a Pope were not enough. Someone had to knit together the demands and build an organisation. Without an intelligentsia - at home and in exile - it is doubtful if the power Walesa unleashed would have turned into an enduring organisation. </p> <p>In 1976, after a strike at Radom was brutally put down by the police, the Workers' Defence Committee - KOR in its Polish acronym - was formed. It seized on a simple but fundamental point; the Polish state should obey its own laws and constitution. Writer-activists such as Adam Michnik and Helena Luczywo published under ground papers and articles. Today Michnik is editor of Gazeta Wyborcza , Poland's best-selling quality newspaper and Luczywo its managing editor. </p> <p>When I met Luczywo, she took me to meet Walesa and other Solidarity leaders. A small, intense, chain-smoking woman consuming endless cups of black tea, she had resisted any offers of exile that her fluent English and high intellect might have brought her. </p> <p>When the Gazeta was founded in 1989, she insisted it would be owned collectively. This year it was floated and she and her fellow editors are now millionaires. 'And what's really great is that even the cafeteria woman and truck drivers had shares in Gazeta, and with the flotation they have got $100,000 apiece.' That sum was more than all the cash Solidarity had 20 years ago. </p> <p>The Polish union did not need money; it wanted news-print and printing machines. Contrary to the myth of millions of US dollars flowing via the Polish union to overthrow communism, the aid was limited. After martial law was declared and Solidarity was driven underground, I went to Warsaw with \u00a35,000 and had to find a contact to deliver the cash. On the way back to the hotel I was arrested at a small demonstration and taken to the Mokotowska police station. </p> <p>I wasn't treated too badly. All I had to do was tear up and swallow the slip of paper with the address of my contact and steer my way through a 4am interrogation focused on whether I knew what Underground station Arsenal fans used. Having decided I wasn't a spy, they left me in a prison for a few days until an official from the British Embassy turned up with a Harrods bag containing Ryvita, Marmite, an apple and two copies of Country Life. A quick appearance before a workers' court - a sullen magistrate flanked by two stern men dressed in blue overalls - and I was free. </p> <p>Across Europe in 1968 something stirred. Demonstrations at Warsaw University were brutally put down. The Communists decided it was the fault of the Jewish intelligentsia, and in the last great expulsion of Jews from Eastern Europe about 30,000 Poles left for exile. </p> <p>It was a fateful mistake. Among them were some of the best and brightest of Poles whose network of dissident friends in Poland would come together in the Seventies to provide the general staff for Walesa and Solidarity. </p> <p>Today Nina Smolar jokes about her stays in the Mokotowska prison. She and her husband, Gienek, were among those exiles. He ended up working for the BBC Polish Service in Bush House. But they spent every spare second and every spare penny at his house in Ealing publishing Michnik and other dissidents, such as Jacek Kuron. They smuggled pamphlets and books to Poland for Luczywo to distribute. </p> <p>Now Gienek Smolar runs Polish radio and his wife is a publisher. Over chopped herring and vodka in their Warsaw flat, they laughed at the conceit of Solidarity being a great Washington-controlled plot to undermine communism. 'If only they knew how few of us there were.' </p> <p>The British link with Solidarity was reinforced by Janus Onyzkiewicz as Walesa's spokesman. He taught maths at Leeds University in the Seventies and speaks the precise accent-free English of a university professor. He is a leading Polish mountain-climber and exuded a sure-footedness with the media alongside the ebullient Walesa. In the Nineties, he became Defence Minister, leading Poland into Nato. </p> <p>If Poles in exile in England were central to the success of the union, there are two British members of the European intelligentsia that everyone in Poland now honours - Neal Ascherson of The Observer and Timothy Garton Ash. The first started visiting and writing about Poland after Cambridge in the Fifties, the second drifted across from his post-Oxford studies in Berlin in 1980. Both fell in love with Poland and surrendered the fakeness of objectivity to become advocates for the revolution they witnessed and helped define. </p> <p>Local wags talk today of Warsaw as Chicago on the Vistula, as the giant office blocks of globalisation now dwarf old Warsaw. In 1980 the restored old town felt artificial, a painted doll's village. Today it is alive with caf\u00e9s, shops, museums, street stalls and the bustle of a great European city. </p> <p>Polish politics, too, has become very European, with swirling coalitions of right-wing parties facing a post-communist reformed Social Democratic Party whose Aleksander Kwasniewski is the country's President and looks likely to be re-elected in October. </p> <p>Walesa is running against him, but few reckon he can make a comeback. On radio he made some anti-Semitic remarks about his opponent which shocked even hard-bitten Walesa-watchers. </p> <p>The old Solidarity leader has found no way of making peace with history or his own personality. He has bitterly denied accusations that he was one of two spies, 'Alek' and 'Bolek', whose names emerged from the Communist secret police archives. Last week both he and Kwasniewski, similarly accused, were cleared by a special court and declared eligible to run for high office. </p> <p>At school and university, I studied revolutions. But I never imagined that I might take part in one. Now, as Poland seeks to make its definitive break with an isolated, often oppressed past by joining the European Union, the best way that Britain can show solidarity is by doing everything to help Poland come home. </p> <p>\u0095 Denis MacShane is Labour MP for Rotherham. </p> <p><b> Milestones on road to democracy</b><br></p> <p>1970: First mass strikes in Gdansk, Lech Walesa emerges as workers' leader </p> <p>1976: KOR founded by Jacek Kuron to defend workers' interests </p> <p>1978: Cardinal Karol Wojtyla becomes Pope John Paul II, the first Polish pontiff </p> <p>1980: Gdansk strikes leads to foundation of first free union in Communist nation </p> <p>1981: Solidarity declared illegal and goes underground </p> <p>1988: Renewed strikes by steelworkers </p> <p>1989: Roundtable talks pave way to free elections in Poland </p> <p>1990: Lech Walesa elected President of Poland </p> <p>1995: Walesa defeated by former Communist Aleksander Kwasniewski </p> <p>2000: Poland speeds up negotiations to enter EU and asks for more support from EU members<br></p> <p><b> Useful links: </b><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.prezydent.pl/aindex.html\" target=\"_NEW\">www.prezydent.pl/aindex.html</a> President of the Republic of Poland</p>",
  "There was a time when Billy Thompson, youngest member of Glasgow's most infamous criminal clan, could rely on his family's reputation to protect him wherever he went. <p>But since the death of his father and brother that reputation is no more. On a quiet Sunday afternoon this month, as Billy strolled past his local post office in the tough Provanmill district of the city's East End, he was set upon by at least three men and stabbed repeatedly in his head and body. </p> <p>Thompson survived - just - and two men have since appeared in court in connection with the attack, which police are treating as attempted murder. </p> <p>Underworld sources say there is a battle to control Glasgow's \u00a3300 million drug market which has spawned a wave of attacks and murders in the city. The lack of a dominant godfather figure means rival factions are fighting to fill the power vacuum, and police fear the violence may escalate further. </p> <p>Although he has been dead for nearly eight years, the name of Arthur Thompson still induces instant amnesia or muteness in Provanmill residents. 'You're wasting your time,' a shopkeeper said. 'No one is going to say anything about him or the rest of the family.' </p> <p>Arthur was an enforcer in Scotland for the Krays during the late Fifties, and by the mid-Sixties had established a chain of pubs and dance halls, popular haunts for gangsters. Friendly with the likes of 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and Billy Hill, he was a leading underworld figure north of the border. </p> <p>In 1966 he escaped death when a bomb exploded in his MG sports car, but his mother-in-law, in the passenger seat, was killed. Arthur suspected that two men from the rival Welsh clan, Patrick Welsh and James Goldie, had planted the bomb. Some time afterwards he spotted them in their van. He drove his Jaguar straight at the van, forcing it off the road and into a lamppost, killing Welsh and Goldie. Arthur was charged with their murders, but he was set free because no witnesses came forward to testify. The incident was part of a long feud between the two clans. In 1969 Thompson's wife, Rita, forced her way into the Welsh home, stabbed Patrick Welsh's wife in the chest, and was jailed for three years. </p> <p>By the Eighties, the Thompson clan had moved into the drug trade led by the Thompsons' eldest son, Arthur Jnr, known as Fat Boy, who operated out of Blackpool. As money rolled in, they converted their council home into a palace, buying the property next door and knocking the two together. This luxury fortress was known as 'The Ponderosa'. </p> <p>Disaster struck in 1985 when Fat Boy was jailed for 11 years when he fell victim to a huge heroin bust. His team, the Barlanark Gang, initially continued paying him a cut, but the two sides quickly fell out as the Gang found new paymasters. </p> <p>The jailing of Fat Boy brought challenges from gangs hoping to take over the Thompson empire. In 1988 Arthur was shot in the groin outside The Ponderosa. He booked himself into a private clinic and told the police the injury had been caused by a drill bit which broke off. </p> <p>Three years later, a car mounted the pavement outside his home and ran him over. Again, Arthur survived and refused to make any statement to the police. In 1989, Arthur's daughter, Margaret, died of a drugs overdose. Two years later Fat Boy was gunned down outside The Ponderosa just six hours after coming home from prison on weekend leave. He died in his father's arms. </p> <p>A few hours before Fat Boy's funeral, the bodies of local hardmen Bobby Glover and Joe 'Bananas' Hanlon, widely thought to be responsible for Fat Boy's death, were found outside a bar in east Glasgow. They had each been shot in the back of the head, with an extra bullet fired up their anuses for good measure. Another local hard man, Paul Ferris, was charged with Fat Boy's murder, but cleared after Scotland's longest criminal trial. He has since been jailed for involvement in a firearms conspiracy. </p> <p>The spot where Fat Boy died is just a few yards from where Billy Thompson was stabbed 10 months ago during the unsuccessful first attempt on his life and a short distance from the site of the most recent attack. Arthur Thompson Snr died of a heart attack in 1993. His death, coupled with the jailing of Paul Ferris on firearms charges in 1999, left a void which has generated a wave of violence. </p> <p>In May, veteran gangland boss Frank McPhee was shot through the head on his doorstep, as his 11-year-old son looked on in terror. Police have run up against a wall of silence, but believe the murder is linked to drugs. </p> <p>One theory is that McPhee had tried to muscle in on the drug trade controlled by former Irish terrorists. He had been a regular visitor to Northern Ireland. A sniper waited for him after he had been chased through Glasgow by another hitman. He had been responsible for negotiating between dealers in the North and the rest of England. He was killed by a single shot from a high-powered .22 rifle. </p> <p>One detective on the case said: 'He had been a dead man walking for years. For McPhee, the end was always going to come like this.' Police are probing his links with a big dogfighting ring. </p> <p>The battle for Glasgow's underworld is being further complicated by the arrival of a new clan of Triad gangsters attempting to take over the drug trade. Earlier this year, pitched battles broke out in Chinese restaurants between the Wo Sing Wo Triad and their rivals, the Tai Huen Chair or Big Circle Gang. </p> <p>Another underworld figure vying for control is a 65-year-old Scot, Billy Blackledge, who has been on the run from the FBI for 10 years for his involvement in a \u00a310 million drugs deal involving Hell's Angels from Canada. He is said to run his empire from a luxury yacht. </p> <p>According to underworld sources, Billy Thompson, who has served a number of prison sentences and has a heroin habit, wanted to regain the former prominence of the Thompson name, despite the fact that he has not inherited any of his father's business acumen. </p> <p>He was jailed three years ago for carrying a knife and, a week after his release, was jailed again for carrying a harpoon gun. On both occasions, he told police that he feared for his life. </p> <p>Billy Thompson has now been taken off the critical list and looks set to make a full recovery. But the damage to his family's already tattered reputation, not to mention the violent implications for Glasgow's underworld, look set to last for some time to come.</p>",
  "<b> 'Cells were extremely untidy, badly maintained with peeling paint, draughty windows, crumbling plasterwork, broken toilet seats and sinks.

Last year alone eight young people killed themselves in prison. </p> <p>Sharon Moore, who runs the Children's Society's remand project, said last night: 'These places have become the dumping ground for some of the most vulnerable young people in our society. Prison just brutalises and isolates them; this case is an example of how it can go terribly wrong.' </p> <p>She said young offenders' institutions and local authority secure units for even younger children were full to bursting point. </p> <p>New inmates were subjected to ritual humiliation on their arrival, a Children's Society worker at a West Midlands young offenders' institution told The Observer. Jan Chown said the younger boys were forced to shout nursery rhymes from the windows of their cells to identify them for future bullying. 'It is completely degrading. This kind of experience does absolutely nothing for these children who would be better off serving their sentences in the community.' </p> <p>Griffin was homeless and his family had, in the words of his lawyer, 'washed their hands of him' when he was caught attempting to burgle a house. The court heard how he broke down in tears in the street when he was apprehended by a neighbour. </p> <p>His solicitor, Mark Pritchard, said: 'I expressed my concern on the day he was remanded. It was his first time in prison and he didn't seem stable.' Because he had also been an accomplice in a cashpoint robbery and because 17-year-olds are effectively treated as adults within the criminal justice system, the courts were given little choice but to give him a custodial sentence. Serious questions are now being raised about reports written while Griffin was on remand at Doncaster prison, which said he was adapting well to prison life. </p> <p>Pritchard has now raised the case of a 15-year-old on remand at Doncaster who cannot be named for legal reasons. He was assessed as vulnerable in Doncaster prison, where he was being bullied. He phones his solicitor every day, telling him that he does not think he can survive the regime. He has been recommended for transfer to a secure unit for juveniles, but has been told he is fourteenth on the waiting list. </p> <p>Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said that the two Yorkshire cases were not isolated examples. 'There are simply too many kids in the system, so they end up being stockpiled in prisons. The number of children in secure units has risen from 200 to 400 over the last year. More children will die if this continues.' </p> <p>Campaigners have seized on the resignation of Thomas, who left his \u00a338,000 a year post as deputy governor in charge of Feltham's juvenile wing on Thursday. Thomas, 29, described children as being 'warehoused' in Dickensian conditions. 'It doesn't take a genius to work out the possible tragic consequences of such an approach,' he said. </p> <p>The Children's Society, which is an arm of the Church of England, is calling on the Government to give a commitment to removing all under-18s from prisons. The Chief Inspector of Prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, has sharply criticised several young offenders' institutions including Feltham, Portland and Glen Parva. </p> <p>A decade ago, the then Conservative government pledged to end imprisonment for 15- and 16-year-olds when it introduced new criminal justice legislation. Section 60 of the 1991 Criminal Justice Act outlawed the imprisonment on remand of 15- and 16-year-olds, but a subsequent section said the practice could continue if there was not enough space in local authority secure accommodation. Since then there has never been enough space outside prisons and so the incarceration of children has continued. </p> <p>The Children's Society, which already works with young offenders in Feltham and Wetherby, has successfully persuaded the Government to back an extension of its bail support system. The society claims this has a 70 per cent success rate in helping young offenders stick to bail conditions and report to court on time.</p>",
  "Tommy Sheridan's answering machine tells you much. 'Sorry I can't take your call,' he says, 'but I'm probably out fighting Blair's New Tories.' <p>His room at Glasgow City Chambers, where we meet, tells you more. Parliamentary and council papers are neatly stacked on the table and when I spill a drop of coffee he halts his discourse to mop it up. </p> <p>Sheridan combines passion with order, ideology with organisational drive. It is eight years since he went to prison for leading resistance to the poll tax. While in Saughton he was elected councillor for Pollok, the housing scheme where he grew up. And it is 16 months since he and the Scottish Socialist Party of which he was a co-founder won a seat in the new Parliament. </p> <p>Now the man once reviled by the Daily Record as a 'dodger' has matured into a formidable political talent and writes a column for the paper that sneered at him. His party is beginning to worry not just Labour but the SNP too and the Bill he has co-sponsored to abolish warrant sales elicited the first sign that the new Parliament could mature into a body with a mind of its own. </p> <p>MSPs threw the ruling coalition into disarray by endorsing the Bill in principle even though, as Sheridan gloomily tells you, the Executive is still trying to kick it into touch. </p> <p>In a way Sheridan, 36, should be grateful to warrant sales and the sheriff's officers who carry them out. He was sent to prison for contempt of court because, as president of the Anti-Poll Tax Federation, he defied an interdict banning him from taking part in a demonstration against the warrant sale of a single parent's property in Glasgow, in 1991. 'There would have been fisticuffs,' says Sheridan. In the event the police called off the sale because they couldn't guarantee the safety of the sheriff's officers. </p> <p>But the authorities' rapid and relentless pursuit of Sheridan established his national profile. While interim interdicts are often breached, imprisonment rarely results. But they decided to make an example of him. He recalls: 'It backfired spectacularly. People saw we were prepared to go to the n th degree. It's been an invaluable asset ever since.' </p> <p>Sheridan's zeal for politics began at school and in the home. Modern studies classes made him aware of South Africa and apartheid, of Martin Luther King and segregation. His father, a storekeeper at Rolls-Royce in Hillington, worked tirelessly for the football team Pollok United. From him Sheridan learnt the value of community. </p> <p>But from his mother he learnt political activism. After years in the bar trade she joined the TGWU and the Labour Party and Sheridan went to Stirling University to study politics and economics as a party member. As the first member of his family to go to university, he was nervous about failing. He worked hard - and discovered Marx. </p> <p>He says: 'Marx and Marxism - it was like a treasure chest of explanation and information. Here was a philosophy which gave some rationale to life itself.' </p> <p>After university his activism grew. He went to the picket lines during the Stockport Messenger dispute and at Wapping. By now involved in Militant Tendency, he escaped successive purges and began his anti-poll tax campaign in the local party in Pollok. After a narrow vote against the non-payment campaign on the grounds that it defied the law, the local MP, the late Jimmy Dunnachie, instigated the proceedings that led to Sheridan's expulsion in 1989 'for bringing the party into disrepute'. </p> <p>It was while out on bail pending his unsuccessful appeal against his six-month sentence in 1992 that he and others formed Scottish Militant Labour. From behind bars he contested Pollok in the April general election and came second with 19 per cent of the vote. At the council elections that May the party won four Glasgow seats (only Sheridan remains on the council). </p> <p>In 1997 the party mutated into the Scottish Socialist Alliance, with support from Communists, Greens and Nationalists and put up 10 general election candidates. This, says Sheridan, built trust on the left but by 1999 it was decided to turn the alliance into a party. </p> <p>The SSP was formed with more than 400 members. In last year's Scottish elections it fielded 25 candidates and was represented in all eight regional lists. Sheridan himself took almost 8 per cent of the vote in Glasgow, though elsewhere the party's share was below 2 per cent. In the Euro elections the same year the party scored 4 per cent. </p> <p>He claims that SSP, feeding on disillusion with Blairite Labour, is growing fast. He says: 'We're now sitting with 2,200 members and 51 branches. I'm going over in two weeks time to Kirkwall to establish a branch. </p> <p>'We've got branches in the south, in Dumfries, Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, and in the north, at Inverness. It's hugely rapid growth. Our timing has been impeccable. We've touched a raw nerve. We couldn't have done this if Labour hadn't been elected. People needed to see for themselves Labour in power. </p> <p>'People are absolutely disenchanted. And in Scotland Labour has a few problems. There is not just one alternative - the SNP - there are two - the SNP and us. The SNP's problem is that they lack clarity in what they stand for, as the leadership election shows.' By contrast the SSP has a 'clear ideological programme'. What is it? 'We want an independent socialist Scotland that raises the need for common ownership and social control of our economy back on the political agenda.' </p> <p>The Scottish Parliament so far, he concedes, has been disappointing. It has too few powers but what annoys him is that it has been unwilling to use those it does have - for example over local taxation. </p> <p>Sheridan wants to replace the regressive council tax, which hits the poor as it hits the rich, with a Scottish service tax. It would exempt all those earning less than \u00a310,000 a year, would be collected at source, remove the need for warrant sales and last year would have generated \u00a3100 million more than council tax. </p> <p>'You could to it tomorrow. But they're not willing to use even the limited powers they've got to effect social change and introduce more equality into our society.' </p> <p>The SSP plans to contest the next General Election 'in a big way'. He says: 'We're going to try to stand in all 72 seats - even though our undemocratic electoral system, based on money, means that we'll need \u00a372,000 to cover deposits and materials.' He adds: 'It's a lot of money for a small Scottish party. But we're going to go for it. We're standing to build a profile. We're standing to gain party loyalty.' </p> <p>The next Scottish elections in 2003 he sees as a major opportunity. Sheridan hopes the party can win 10 or more seats and thinks eight-to-10 well within its grasp. He continues: 'The SNP, I think, will gain and Labour will lose, the Liberal Democrats will lose. You might have the SNP then looking to form an administration with some of the smaller parties. If that happened then our demand would be that our redistributive policies are on the agenda. That's a price the SNP would have to pay. Whether they'd be willing to pay it I don't know but we wouldn't be easy negotiators. We're not after power for power's sake. Our whole history has shown that.' </p> <p>Sheridan describes himself as a 'revolutionary' committed to an open and democratic road. Essentially, one senses, he is still part of the Labour left in exile. Tony Benn is among his heroes. </p> <p>It is no accident that his co-sponsors of the Bill to abolish warrant sales are John McAllion, the often dissident Labour MSP, and Alex Neil, who is standing on a left-wing ticket for the SNP leadership. Tommy Sheridan has his eyes on the fringes of both the main parties and may yet emerge as a strategic figure capable of uniting the Scottish left.</p>",
  "The two men could not look more different. One is lean and frosty in his sharply pressed military fatigues and trademark aviator sunglasses. The other is tubby, loud and was a one-time putative father-in-law of Diana, Princess of Wales. <p>But Mohamed al-Fayed, owner of Harrods of Knightsbridge, and Hun Sen, strongman Prime Minister of Cambodia, have found a common interest that no one ever suspected: oil. </p> <p>Cambodia is the latest in a series of exotic locations targeted by Fayed as he looks for more ways to make money. On 21 March, Hun Sen and Fayed spent two hours in a plush office in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, discussing an oil concession in the poverty-stricken state. </p> <p>For Hun Sen such a deal could mean investment for his economy and diplomatic legitimacy for his regime, and for Fayed a sought-after entry into a virtually untapped, fabulously lucrative source of oil and gas. </p> <p>For environmentalists and human rights activists, the deal raises grave concerns. </p> <p>Fayed had flown into the city's Ponchentong airport following an invitation from Hun Sen through a mutual friend. The Egyptian-born tycoon, 67, was in Thailand to oversee the expansion of his recently launched oil exploration projects, run by Harrods Energy, a Bermuda-registered company. </p> <p>The company's Bangkok-based subsidiary recently spent $4 million (\u00a32.7m) on a stake in the natural gas exploration block in the Gulf of Thailand. </p> <p>Analysts see Cambodia as one of the few remaining 'virgin territories' for oil. 'No one is sure how much there is to be had, but there is a good chance of making a lot of money for minimal outlay,' one Malaysia-based expert said. </p> <p>One company reported to already have a presence in Cambodia is Unocal, an American oil firm widely criticised for its involvement with the hardline Taliban regime in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Human rights activists are already criticising Fayed for doing business with Hun Sen. The Cambodian leader seized power in a bloody coup three years ago. Since then he has been accused of murdering scores of political opponents. A United Nations report accused him of running an elite military unit which killed and tortured at least 40 activists from the ousted Royalist Party during the takeover. </p> <p>Elections in 1998, though given approval by international observers, are widely believed to have been rigged and marred by widespread intimidation of voters. A 45- year-old opposition party worker died from a blow to the back of the head after having an ear sliced off and his eyes gouged out. The police recorded a verdict of suicide. </p> <p>During the election, government security forces violently put down pro-democracy demonstrations, shooting and killing protesters who included Buddhist monks. A spokesman for Amnesty International said yesterday: 'Businesses must use their influence to ensure they are not linked in any way to human rights abuses. The bottom line is that if they fail to do so, their corporate reputation will suffer.' </p> <p>But Fayed has never shied away from controversy. In April he announced a deal with Libya's Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, who is still under US sanctions. Fayed's Harrods Petroleum company is to help the Libyan national oil organisation develop three major fields. </p> <p>Fayed's talks with Hun Sen in March centred on the exploration of three oilfields in the centre of Cambodia close to the famous Tonle Sap lake system, the world's largest freshwater fishery. </p> <p>Last week a spokesman for Fayed confirmed that Harrods companies were involved in seismic surveys in the Battambang, Pusat and Kampong Chhang regions just to the west of the Tonle Sap. Some of the fields are only 50 miles from the famous Angkor Wat temple systems, one of the most delicate archaeological treasures in the world. </p> <p>He also confirmed that the exploration was aimed at establishing if oil and gas in two major subterranean basins is of sufficient quality to warrant further investment. The basins extend under the lake and environmentalists fear that any development in the region could have disastrous results. 'It is a fragile eco-system and any accident would have a massive effect. If something went wrong, there is nothing there to tackle it,' said Patrick Alley, co-founder of Global Witness, campaigners in Cambodia. Alley pointed out that, with its enormous fisheries, the lake provides 70 per cent of the protein consumed by Cambodia's 10 million people, most of whom live around its shores. </p> <p>After years of war and the devastation wrought by Pol Pot and his extremist Maoist Khmer Rouge, everyone agrees that Cambodia - where life expectancy is still only 48 - desperately needs investment. 'But I would be happier if the government were dealing with a company with a more established track record,' Alley said. </p> <p>Harrods said last week: 'Mr al-Fayed realises the importance of the environment and will not engage in any drilling or exploration to the detriment of the environment. He is keen to increase revenue for the country to benefit the population of Cambodia but the environment must come first. </p> <p>'Harrods Energy has a long history of work and studies carried out to protect the environment before carrying out any exploration.' </p> <p> jason.burke@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "French men are to be encouraged to come to England to be sterilised. <p>Marie Stopes, the British family planning charity, plans to offer the first 'vasectomy tourism service' and is targeting the men reputed to be the world's best lovers because the operation is illegal in France. </p> <p>The service will be launched tomorrow at a press conference during which a Frenchman will be sterilised to prove how easy it is. Bernard Schnakenbourg, a father of one, will then recount his experience. </p> <p>Doctors in France can be imprisoned for performing vasectomies under a law against 'self-mutilation' introduced by Napoleon. The procedure can be undertaken only in cases where there are strong medical reasons. </p> <p>Britain is the world's vasectomy capital, with more men being snipped than in any other country. According to UN figures, 16 per cent of British men of reproductive age have had the operation. </p> <p>Marie Stopes will suggest that the operation can be undertaken in a day trip from Paris, or as spokesman Tom Kerridge suggested: 'Why not enjoy London for a couple of days while you're at it?' </p> <p>The procedure, which is usually irreversible, costs \u00a3200 and involves cauterising the tubes that carry the sperm with a laser tool. </p> <p>Schnakenbourg, 47, said: 'I am prepared to travel to the UK to access a vasectomy because my partner and I do not want any more children and I think it is only fair that couples share the responsibility for contraception.' </p> <p>Vasectomies are engulfed by taboos in France, where Marie Stopes has found it hard to place adverts for the service. One features a variation of a traditional Napoleon pose - with his hand below his belt - and the caption: 'Two hundred years on, he's still got a grip on them.'</p>",
  "The glorious Twelfth dawned bright and warm yesterday and Graham Irvine should have been a happy man. After eight months of planning, the shooting agent should be sitting back and watching his hard work pay off as heather moors across Scotland echo to the sound of shotguns for the most eagerly awaited date in the country sports calendar: the start of the red grouse season. <p>But Irvine is far from content. Like the rest of the grouse industry, he is braced for a season likely to be far from glorious, thanks to a fatal combination of disease and bad weather which has devastated bird populations and forced some estate owners to cancel shooting days worth tens of thousands of pounds. </p> <p>'I've been in this business for 20 years and I've never seen anything like it,' said Irvine, who is based in Blair Atholl, in the heart of Perthshire's grouse country. 'We have had some bad years but this one is going to be particularly bad. The birds just are not there on a lot of estates and that has hit us badly.' By 12 August most years, Irvine could expect to have bookings for about 100 shooting parties. This year he is down to 40. </p> <p>He is not alone. The season may be just 24 hours old, but many sporting estates are facing the prospect of cancelling shooting parties because there are not enough birds to kill without damaging future stocks. </p> <p>The cost of cancelled shoots is high. Walked-up shooting, where shooters and dogs hike across the moor on foot, killing birds they drive up from the ground, costs between \u00a350 and \u00a365 a brace, with a day's shooting for a party of five costing up to \u00a31,500. The big money, however, is in driven grouse, where shooters in butts take on whirling grouse forced from the heather towards them by a line of beaters. The cost is up to \u00a3110 a brace, with a party of eight paying up to \u00a310,000 a day for the privilege. </p> <p>The shortage of birds represents a serious setback for more than just the red grouse industry, which had been hoping that two good seasons in 1998 and 1999 marked a turn in its fortunes after two decades of bad news. With game fishing already in crisis because of the long-term decline of wild salmon and sea trout stocks, it is also a major blow for the already beleaguered Scottish tourism industry. Sport shooting and fishing by British tourists alone is worth \u00a338 million a year to the Scottish economy. </p> <p>The crisis began at the turn of the year when overpopulation of grouse on many moors sparked an outbreak of a parasitic worm disease called strongylosis which thrived in the wet winter and spring. The parasites have claimed the lives of many adult birds. </p> <p>Some of the most renowned estates have been affected. Mar Lodge, near Braemar, is famed for its walked-up shoots. In a typical season the estate, owned by the National Trust for Scotland, would expect to bag 500 brace. This year it is forecasting no more than 300. </p> <p>Stewart Cumming, the estate's head stocker, said: 'We have had reasonably good years recently, but the worms and the bad weather have meant that the nest sizes this year are a lot smaller, so we are going to have to lose some days of shooting. That is the first time we have been faced with anything that bad at Mar.' </p> <p>Scone Palace estate in Perthshire, owned by Lord Mansfield, has also been hit by the parasites. Three weeks ago, one of the keepers was checking numbers when he found a dead grouse and took it away for analysis. The bird was infested with more than 30,000 worms. </p> <p>'The prospect of having to cancel is a headache everybody faces every year,' said Stephen Kennedy, from the estate. 'But we know how many birds we would like to see, and we are not as confident as we would like to be.' </p> <p>To add to the problems, on some moors many of the chicks have been struck down by an infestation of ticks, which spread from large mammals such as red deer, sheep and hares. </p> <p>Over recent years, culling of deer and hare has been stepped up to prevent the tick infestation, and sheep have been removed from hills. But in many areas the measures appear to have failed. </p> <p>Some gamekeepers and shooting agents blame the outbreaks on the farming crisis, which they claim has forced many hill farmers to cut back the number of times they dip their sheep to kill off ticks. </p> <p>To be faced with these shortages at the start of the season is a major disappointment for gamekeepers, who have spent months on building stocks to the right level before shooting. </p> <p>Adam Smith, head of the red grouse research project at the Game Conservancy Trust, said: 'It is reasonable to say that while the last two years have gone very well, this will be the first year for some time when estates are going to have to cut back their bookings. The vast majority will not be too badly damaged by that, but if this continues for another couple of seasons, then people will be talking about a serious crisis for red grouse.' </p> <p>Some are more bullish about prospects for the season. John Phillips, director of the Heather Trust, claims talk of a shortage is simply scaremongering. </p> <p>'The tick problem is no worse this year than in previous years, and I believe that while this season will not be so good in some places, it will be very good in others. There is a lot against the grouse, but it has to be said that good estate managers can produce good grouse when they put their minds to it.' </p> <p>But for Graham Irvine, that is cold comfort as he contemplates what will probably be a disastrous season. 'I don't know what can be done about it, but if things don't improve soon, we will all be in trouble.'</p>",
  "As the service began, a small girl tucked her knees under her chin and nervously slammed her fist down again and again onto the seat next to her. Behind, an even younger boy began howling. But there was no irritation among the adults. Parents gently held their fractious children, their neighbours smiled sadly, and the service to remember Sarah Evelyn Isobel Payne, the eight-year-old girl whose brutal murder sparked a nationwide debate into the risks our children live alongside, continued. <p>The 40-minute service at Guildford Cathedral yesterday was attended by around 600 mourners. Sarah's favourite hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful', 'Morning has Broken' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sung. </p> <p>Jonathan Good, Sarah's teacher remembered how, before her death, Sarah had taken to drawing pictures of children doing handstand races. Pictures, he added, that were best appreciated when upside down. </p> <p>During a trip to the seaside last summer, Good remembered Sarah and her friends undaunted by foul weather. They built a sandcastle so splendid the teacher felt compelled to give them a prize. </p> <p>Two brothers watched from behind a bush some distance off as Sarah's family released 12 white doves from the cathedral green. A middle-aged man strode into view, dishevelled and a little shaky on his feet. 'Who's that?' the youngest boy asked. His brother hesitated. 'Not sure.' The man, unaware of the children, stumbled closer and the brothers grasped each other's hands and bolted back to their mother, who held them tight. And didn't let go. </p> <p>Children are at the forefront of the current debate about paedophiles in our midst. On vigilante marches and in family homes, parents say they are protesting for the love of children. But are they teaching every child to hate? </p> <p>They are certainly participating in the debates. Take 13-year-old Jodie and Sadie, 12, who made a dummy, painted 'paedo' on its chest and strung it by the neck from a lamppost in Portsmouth's Paulsgrove council estate, where the nation's post-Sarah Payne revulsion toward paedophiles boiled into violence and protests over the past week. </p> <p>Small children talk of 'pervs' and 'bashing their heads in'. </p> <p>Mothers say the summer holidays have been spoiled, that they won't let their kids out of their sight. Children tell you they are scared. </p> <p>Lynn Webb, 35, shows placards her four children made for the protest marches, cut from Fisher Price toy boxes. </p> <p>'Elly helped the girls colour them in,' said Webb, 35. Toddler Elly grinned. </p> <p>'People have said I'm wrong to take children on marches till midnight but I'm a single mum and I can't leave them here. They want to go. This is for them after all and nobody ever gives children a voice. We've got a perv over the road and he's always giving kids funny looks.' </p> <p>Jodie is scared: 'I want to go out with my friends but I won't because of all them pervs out there.' </p> <p>Like many, Webb believes child abduction is commonplace and that there is far more threat to children today than there was in her youth. Both perceptions are not borne out by statistics. </p> <p>In Paulgrove the children on social services' 'at risk' register outnumber the three or four men on the sexual offenders' register. </p> <p>Katrina Kessell was abused as a child. While she talks to The Observer her four children play in the garden with a rabbit under the watchful eye of their grandmother Mavis. </p> <p>A steady stream of visitors has been up and down the concrete path of the house where Kessell has been holding court for the media and, she says, for local people, often strangers, who have come to name names. She says people have been bringing her 'documentary evidence' of men they claim are paedophiles. 'They have been coming in and telling me the most terrible stories of how they were abused. It has been heartbreaking, we've all been in tears,' she said. </p> <p>Kessell says it was from these personal accounts that the protesters' list of 22 names - 'and still growing' - was compiled. Only the first, Victor Burnett, 53, published in the News of the World 's name and shame campaign, is a confirmed convicted sex offender. Last Sunday Burnett moved out of his home to a safe house. His sister's car was set alight. </p> <p>Five homes have so far been attacked during Paulsgrove's week of nighttime marches. Up to 10 fearful families and individuals have fled their homes. Kessell claims she did not begin the protests but has become a figurehead and holds the key to 'the list'. </p> <p>Kessell, who will only talk to The Observer in the presence of self-appointed press officer John Palmer, said: 'We all decide as a group whether someone should be on the list from the information we have gathered, we check all the details before we go and stand outside a house,' she said, refusing to say what kind of proof is required. </p> <p>Michelle lives in an immaculately clean house filled with collectors' dolls and pictures of Elvis. Her five children, well-mannered and well-behaved, are not allowed out to play by themselves. </p> <p>'This is all about how we must change the law. It's not right for these people to live among children. We should put them all together on an island,' she said. 'And blow it up,' 10-year-old Kevin interjects. 'Pervs are everywhere.' Four-year-old Chad pipes up : 'I'll kick them in the nuts.'</p>",
  "<p>Many years ago, a hacker named Phil Zimmermann wrote a program which enabled one to encrypt email messages using a technique called public-key cryptography. He called it Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and posted it on the net so that Joe Public could have the same kind of encryption facilities that spooks take for granted. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the spooks went ape-shit. Using a preposterous legal argument, the US government defined PGP as 'ammunition', thereby making it subject to laws prohibiting the export of weaponry without the express permission of Uncle Sam. They prosecuted Zimmermann on charges that could have landed him in jail for years. PGP was still available on the net, but anyone downloading it from outside the US was committing a criminal offence, for which they could in theory have been extradited to the US. </p> <p>While all this was going on, I was browsing in a (British) university library and came upon a massive bound volume entitled Pretty Good Privacy. It consisted of hundreds of pages of computer printout and was, in fact, the source code of the PGP program. If I had the time (or access to a good scanner) I could have used the book to create a working copy of the program Zimmermann was banned from exporting from the US. </p> <p>It was my first glimpse of a distinction which may become critical for basic cyberspace freedoms. While the US government could control the publication of PGP in computable form, it couldn't exert that control on the written version of the program: the written version would enjoy the protection of the First Amendment and meddling would therefore have been unconstitutional. </p> <p>This legal nicety has suddenly become very important in relation to DeCSS, the program for decrypting DVD disks so they can be played on computers using the Linux operating system. In a Manhattan court, eight Hollywood studios are suing the publisher of 2600, a hacker magazine, for posting the DeCSS code on his website. This, they say, contravenes the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which makes it illegal to devise ways of circumventing copy-protection schemes such as the CSS system, which protects DVD movies. </p> <p>The case was going swimmingly for the movie moguls until Professor David Touretzky, a computer scientist at Carnegie-Mellon University, took the stand as an expert witness. He produced a series of exhibits that included lines of software source code in the C computer language, an English-language description of the code, long strings of ones and zeros (known as object code) and a picture of a T-shirt with the DeCSS object code printed on it. The point of this exercise was to make a devastatingly simple point: if the judge saw fit to ban any one depiction of the DVD-unscrambling software, he would have to ban them all, because they all communicate the same thing. </p> <p>'I see this as having a chilling effect on my ability as a computer scientist to express myself,' Touretzky said. 'If the court upholds this injunction, what would happen is that certain uses of computer language - my preferred means of expression - would be illegal.' </p> <p>At this point, according to the New York Times reporter present, there was a sharp intake of breath among m'learned friends. The judge, who had hitherto seemed inclined to the view that computer code was no more expressive than an automobile ignition key, suddenly declared that he would have to reconsider his constitutional analysis. </p> <p>'It would be hard to make a case that computer code of any kind has no expressive content,' he said. 'Which then gets you to the question of how then do you deal with it under the First Amendment?' Precisely.

  "<p>The mapping of the human genome has confirmed Darwin's theory of evolution, according to Bill Castell, chief executive of Nycomed Amersham. He is hoping that the Nasdaq flotation of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (APB) will finally persuade investors that his group has evolved into one of the stars of the healthcare industry. </p> <p>Nycomed Amersham has undoubtedly made great strides since 1990 when, to quote Castell, its idea of innovation was to put radioactive material in a different-shaped phial. Now, it is a global business with a market-leading position in imaging, its instruments were used to sequence three of the first four chromosomes to be mapped, and it is a market leader in the fast-growing area of genetic sequencing. </p> <p>The City has not ignored the transformation. A share price which is about 29 times the expected earnings for the full year is a decent premium to the market, but is more than 10 per cent below pharmaceuticals companies such as GlaxoWellcome or its betrothed, SmithKline Beecham. And they do not have a hi-tech gene mapping subsidiary to float. </p> <p>Nycomed Amersham is clearly convinced that floating 10 per cent of APB, planned for the autumn, will unlock hidden value in the group. The genetic blueprint may now be complete, but the big bucks will be made in exploiting that information. There are plenty of rivals muscling in on its territory, but none covers the waterfront in quite the way Nycomed Amersham does. </p> <p>Analysts estimate that the business will attract a valuation between $4 billion and $6bn (\u00a32.6bn to \u00a34bn). That would value its share at around \u00a31.9bn, leaving the remainder of Amersham's businesses valued at just over \u00a32bn, or less than 20 times earnings. True, some parts of the business - such as its seeds for cancer therapy and some of its unpatented products - are achieving pedestrian sales growth. But the core imaging business managed a 17 per cent sales increase, driven by products such as Myoview, its heart diagnostic product. </p> <p>Critics point out that half of APB is in research products, where sales last year rose by just 3 per cent, and wonder whether the float will achieve the valuations predicted. And they question whether the rest of Amersham deserves a premium rating. But Castell and his team have done an excellent job evolving Amersham from a public-sector monolith to a highly focused, innovative business. That will eventually be recognised in the price. Buy the shares. </p> <p><strong> Reed sounds a stronger note</strong><br> </p> <p> Crispin Davis's appointment as chief executive of Reed Elsevier may not have been greeted with universal acclaim but, a year on, the City is finally warming to his approach. Interim profit before tax may have fallen 4 per cent, after adjusting for things like currency and exceptional items, but that was because of increased investment on internet initiatives. The underlying picture was of a business which not only knows where it wants to go - something the old management was good at - but also has a plan to get there. </p> <p>There are new executives in key management positions (apart from finance director) and Davis appears to have tight control. The \u00a3750 million three-year internet investment programme announced in February is already bearing fruit. So far, \u00a3110m has been spent, rising to \u00a3260m by the year-end. </p> <p>Internet-generated sales reached \u00a3160m in the first six months of 2000, and are expected to be \u00a3400m for the whole year. The science division was the biggest beneficiary. But there are also signs that it has managed to stop the rot in the legal business, where it has launched a service for small firms and is establishing a good presence in universities. </p> <p>On cost control, it is likely to exceed the promised \u00a3130m savings this year, suggesting there was a lot more fat in the group than analysts realised. </p> <p>The only thing that really spooked the City was Davis's interest in US publisher Harcourt Brace, which is up for sale. But analysts take the view that Davis was expressing more a healthy interest in the affairs of its rivals than a serious intention to acquire. </p> <p>After a faltering start, Reed's shares have recovered strongly in the past two months. They may now pause for breath, but those prepared to wait for their rewards should buy now. </p> <p><strong> Bolt from Colt is over the top</strong><br> </p> <p> The collapse in Colt Telecom's share price after Paul Chisholm, its president and chief executive, announced that he planned to spend more time with his family in the US, perfectly illustrates how illogical the City's attitude to technology stocks is. </p> <p>Colt Telecom is one of the more successful of the new generation of phone operators. It has done all it promised in establishing its European network, attracting large corporate customers and increasing its revenue. </p> <p>The number of buildings connected to its network in the second quarter of the year jumped by 68 per cent over last year, while the number of minutes switched rose by 138 per cent. Profits are, of course, still a rather distant prospect but at least it has funds - \u00a32bn to be precise - which should be enough to get it into that position. </p> <p>Chisolm's departure is significant. He was the driving force behind the company's growth and will be missed. But he is hardly making a dash for the door with binbags full of trade secrets. Indeed, he is doing all he can to ensure an orderly succession: he will not finally depart for Boston until next year, and will stay on the board after a successor is appointed. </p> <p>But such high-flying companies are valued less on common sense than on sentiment. Any unexpected news is likely to move the price sharply. That does not make it logical, however. Compared with some of the internet upstarts, Colt is well established with a long pedigree. A new chief executive, backed by the existing management team, should be well equipped to carry the business forward. Investors have some cause to be worried about how Colt's business model will adapt in the face of rapidly changing telephone technology. </p> <p>The slump following Chisolm's departure looks overdone.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Ronson in \u00a3200m property sell-off</strong><br> </p> <p>Property tycoon Gerald Ronson, who in 1990 served a six-month sentence for his part in the Guinness insider-dealing scandal, has sold central London office properties worth \u00a3200m. </p> <p>Ronson, whose company Heron International is backed by some of the world's richest individuals, including Bill Gates of Microsoft and Rupert Murdoch, is taking advantage of a rising West End office market.

  "We're all in therapy these days. Some of us still do it the old-fashioned way, lying down on a couch in front of a stranger and telling them our deepest and most private fears and desires. Everybody else just breathes in: it's in the air, the language, the media, burrowed deeply into our culture and touching every aspect of our lives. It is even replacing religion, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who recently complained that Christ the Saviour had become Christ the Counsellor. <p>Psychotherapy is only 100 years old, but in that time, it has grown from a controversial, marginal treatment for the 'mad' into a multimillion pound industry incorporating more than 400 different kinds of therapy, treating everything from personality disorders to weight loss. </p> <p>Since the 80s in particular, Britain has been in the grip of a therapy boom. Reliable figures are hard to find - as well as 400 kinds of therapy, there are at least 75 different training organisations - but if we take 'therapy' to include psychiatry, psychology, psychotherapy and counselling, hundreds of thousands have had some sort of treatment. And 51 per cent of GPs' surgeries now have some kind of therapist attached - up from 31 per cent just 10 years ago. </p> <p>But in spite of its apparent health, therapy is also in deep trouble, under attack both from within - the variety of the new therapies is one of its biggest problems, leading as it has to bitter political in-fighting over definitions of authenticity and legitimacy - and from a growing army of academics and doctors who question its most basic tenets. Increasingly, it is accused of causing the very problems it seeks to cure, encouraging isolated, self-absorbed individuals who only know how to look inwards. Writers such as David Smail and Philip Cushman have argued that there is too much emphasis on subjective truth, and not enough on the social and cultural forces that also shape our lives and cause our problems. </p> <p>As it re-groups and re-evaluates, therapy is having an identity crisis. Is it a way to treat psychological disorders? Or, with the advances in pharmacology and genetics, is it increasingly a tool for personal development? Is it a secular religion, helping us to understand the meaning of our existence? Does it aim to resolve our problems, or only to help us manage and accept them? How long should it last? And, at the heart of it all, the big question: does it even work? </p> <p>'It is an important question,' says Dr Giovanna di Ceglie, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. 'But what do we mean by \"work\"? Each case is different. Each time, you have a different therapeutic aim. I had a patient who came to see me in distress, but when I asked him why he'd come, he replied that he honestly did not know. This man had a serious eating disorder - he was anorexic. He did not want to acknowledge this problem, and he refused to have it treated. He came to me because he wanted to alleviate his emotional pain without giving up his addiction to anorexia. So the therapeutic aim was to get him to acknowledge his illness and to get physical treatment for it. We worked together very slowly on his personality, his relationships and sexuality. It took five years for him to reach the point where he accepted my referral to a doctor who could deal with the issues of his weight, eating habits and diet. So we didn't cure his anorexia, but helped him to acknowledge his illness. Does that mean the therapy worked or didn't work?' </p> <p>For much of its history, psychotherapy had dismissed that question as unanswerable in any definitive sense. The subtle and intricate process of therapy could not be number-crunched or measured. 'Proof' came from patients' or therapists' own assessments, not from hard data or rigorous research. Climbing on to the couch was essentially an act of faith. </p> <p>Many claim to have been helped by therapy, but how have they been helped, and by how much? In 1952, psychologist Hans Eysenck discovered 'spontaneous remission', claiming that while around two-thirds of therapy patients improved over a two-year period, the same number of untreated patients showed the same improvements. Therapy did no harm, but it made no difference. </p> <p>Only recently have we begun systematically to research which treatments work for which problems - and which don't. The results so far are mixed, sometimes flawed, and rarely show long-term results. But Eysenck's work has been countered with many studies since, showing much better results for the therapy patients. In spite of its inherent flaws and failings, a body of real evidence for the efficacy of therapy is growing. </p> <p>Professor Peter Fonagy is one of the few therapists to have undertaken a serious, far- reaching review of psychotherapy research. His book, What Works for Whom?: A Critical Review of Psychotherapy Research (\u00a318.99, Guildford Press) co-written by Anthony Roth, reviews 50 years' worth of different kinds of studies and research, and is considered to be the definitive work of its kind. (It was published in 1996 and is currently being revised.) 'There are many problems in researching psychotherapy,' says Professor Fonagy. 'I don't entirely accept the old, purist argument that it can't be studied empirically, but I do understand it. There is a large element of creativity in therapy. A dozen therapists may belong to the same school of thought, yet practise very differently. How do you quantify the elements of a human relationship? Many therapists see their work as part medicine, part art. They liken research to a reduction: how do you measure how funny a joke is? Or how beautiful a painting? But we cannot hide behind this argument. We can and should be measurable and accountable. It will probably take another 10 years, but we are finally moving to Evidence Based Medicine (EBM).' </p> <p>His research uncovers substantial support for psychotherapy in treating a wide range of emotional problems. In fact, in many cases it is more effective than other medical interventions. 'The important point,' says Fonagy, 'is that there is no such thing as one size fits all in therapy. An acute anxiety-related problem can often be dealt with in some kind of brief, well-structured therapy. But a deeper problem requires longer treatment, and often a combination of drugs and therapy.' Problems like depression tend to respond around the 20th session of therapy, while more serious dysfunctions, such as personality disorders, will usually show improvements after six to 12 months. Patients who have had abusive or traumatic experiences can be difficult to treat 'if they have lost their trust. Therapy is based on trust, and it is hard for it to be effective without it.' </p> <p>For some specific problems, such as phobias and panic attacks, cognitive or behavioural therapy is most effective. There can be subtle differences of approach depending on the nature of the problem. 'Children with Attention Deficient Disorder (ADD) who have anxiety problems benefit most from a combined drug and therapy treatment. But if the child had ADD without anxiety, then there is no real role for therapy.' And the brave new world of drug treatments is to be welcomed, he says, but not regarded as a substitute for therapy. 'They both work, but they have very different approaches. What therapy aims to do is to restore equilibrium. When we lose our equilibrium, when we are distressed and unhappy, I believe that there is a deep human impulse to reach out for help to another human being. When you see news footage of disasters like the Columbine shooting, you always see the same image - of people with their arms outstretched, stumbling towards each other. Seeking therapy is a version of the same impulse.' </p> <p>Unlike many therapists and doctors, Professor Fonagy sees no innate superiority of either treatment. 'We find more and more that integrated approaches are very helpful. In some cases drugs are most effective, but perhaps not as many as you might think. For example, there are powerful drugs for treating children with aggression problems, but they have enormous side effects. It is much safer and just as effective to use Multi- Systemic Therapy - a very complex therapy where the therapist practically moves in, dealing with all the layers of social and emotional difficulty across the whole family.' This can have profound results 'but it is expensive and absolutely depends on finding a highly skilled, well-trained therapist.' </p> <p>Ah - the therapist. We may be getting much closer to discovering which therapies work for whom, but the success of any therapy is limited to the skill and ability of the practitioner. Who can define what makes a 'good therapist?' Most professionals cite proper and rigorous training as a fundamental, but that doesn't mean that all well- trained therapists are good ones. 'Broadly speaking, about two-thirds of therapy can be said to work and a third to fail,' says Fonagy. 'While certain kinds of therapies are better suited to certain kinds of problems, most of the failure comes, in my view, from a lack of skill on the part of the therapist.' 'Skill' in this sense seems to refer to something harder to define. 'Talent' is a better description, implying innate abilities such as perception, empathy and sincerity. Perhaps not surprising for a treatment based on a relationship, it seems to be human qualities that determine therapeutic excellence. </p> <p>David Smail, clinical psychologist and author of How to Survive without Psychotherapy , dismisses the emphasis on training in psychotherapy: 'Most of it is just ideological rubbish. Qualities of wisdom, experience, intelligence and empathy are far more important, and these aren't restricted to \"trained therapists\". We had \"therapy\" long before we had therapists or the therapy industry. Speaking openly and honestly to a concerned and interested person has always been therapeutic, but in the past we'd have talked to priests or family members or friends.' Giovanna di Ceglie only half-agrees. 'Certainly, those qualities are very important. But without training you are just listening, not understanding. Training provides the body of theories, models and knowledge - a structure for moving the patient forward.' Formally trained therapists are required to undergo years of analytical therapy themselves as part of the training process. 'This is crucial. Without it, you can't be sure that you aren't treating the patient from your own emotional agenda.' </p> <p> The issue of training - how much, for how long - is a cornerstone of therapy's current crisis. Psychotherapy has no central governing body, no regulation, no consistency of training or standards, no quality control. You can train for five years or five days and still call yourself a therapist. While some therapists are highly trained and evolved human beings, others are dangerous quacks. The potential for exploitation - in a close, intimate relationship in which the patient is, by definition, distressed and emotionally vulnerable - is enormous. </p> <p>Lord Alderdice, who practised as a psychiatrist and psychotherapist in Northern Ireland, has brought forward a Private Member's Bill in the House of Lords, proposing a central governing body to regulate the whole field. Why it has taken 100 years is anybody's guess. 'It's quite scandalous in my view that patients don't have the protection of a properly regulated system. There are a lot of people practising who aren't properly trained, and some of them are downright dangerous. A bad therapist can be far worse than no therapist at all. I know, because I've sometimes had to take some of their patients in for treatment.' The Bill has had its first reading, and is now being submitted to further discussion and amendments. 'Psychotherapy is a wide field. We want to allow diversity, but apply standardised rules and regulations. It will take time, but this is a process which is way overdue. Psychotherapy is a branch of medicine and it should be as monitored and regulated as any other.' </p> <p>If matching the right therapy and therapist to the patient are two prongs of what makes therapy work, the patients themselves are the third. Many therapists, and therapy texts, stress the importance of the 'fit' or 'working alliance' between practitioner and patient. In simple terms, this means they like and respect each other enough to commit to working together. A good therapist will refer a patient they don't like or feel they can't relate to, while a good patient will pay attention to any warning signals, such as feeling uncomfortable, disregarded or bullied. </p> <p>Signs that the therapy will be successful are often apparent at the earliest sessions. 'When I think about my own failures, they have usually been failures of engagement,' admits di Ceglie. All therapy has a high early drop-out rate, so engagement is crucial. If they stay for 26 sessions, about 75 per cent of patients are estimated to improve. </p> <p>But even with a good therapist, an appropriate therapy and a good 'fit', a good outcome is not guaranteed. Some people just tend to do better in therapy than others. There is a known correlation between IQ and response, according to Peter Fonagy, while motivated, committed and self-aware patients - surprise, surprise - do best of all. These are also the patients most likely to be better educated about what therapy is, and to have the most realistic expectations. </p> <p>Some patients, for example, go into psychotherapy because they want advice and guidance from the therapist, but the therapy they have chosen may be analytical or exploratory. This feeds the common charge against therapy that it works best for the middle classes. But that ignores the ever- growing number of NHS clinics where all classes and groups are treated. Lower-income patients may have a higher drop-out rate but, where they remain in treatment, results are about the same. Individuals who over-intellectualise the process, who are unwilling to 'let go', who conceal or deny their true feelings and experiences, or who expect to have all the work done for them by the therapist, don't benefit. </p> <p> Freud's basic premise still governs most (though certainly not all) of psychotherapy: our early experiences shape our personalities, our feelings affect the way we think, behave and relate to other people, and we are all subject to unconscious psychological forces. Therapy lets us access our unconscious and make sense of our emotions and experiences. Once we know ourselves, we can change ourselves - or at least, we can't change if we don't know ourselves. Therapy's ultimate promise is something ever-increasing amounts of us are seeking with ever-increasing enthusiasm: personal transformation. And all of this is achieved by sitting in a quiet room, and just talking. </p> <p>While research has proved its point for the emotionally disturbed, we still debate the role of therapy for 'personal development', for those we sneeringly dismiss as 'the worried well'. But Giovanna di Cegli, doesn't accept that one group of humans is more deserving of therapy than another. 'Why draw a distinction between the emotionally disturbed and those who come for apparently \"lesser\" problems, such as relationship difficulties or feeling stuck at work? While we may judge that these problems are not so severe, they can cause us enormous difficulties and distress. Sometimes they mask other emotional issues. It is not self- indulgence to try to clarify and understand these things. Therapy is often difficult, expensive and painful. Why would you accept all of that if you didn't need to?' Therapy may be the last place where we can seriously ponder the meaning not just of our lives but of life itself. You don't have to be sick, or self-indulgent, for that to be a serious and worthwhile pursuit. </p> <p>'Psychotherapy can help pragmatically with specific problems and difficulties,' adds Peter Fonagy, 'but beyond that, what it gives you is a way to understand yourself and others. And while nobody can ignore the problems and failings of therapy itself, I believe that its legacy is benign. </p> <p>'Compare our world after 100 years of psychotherapy. Our attitudes to our penal and psychiatric institutions have been transformed. We understand now that crime and criminals can have psychological reasons, and the importance of children's development. Sometimes we forget that these are radical ideas which are slowly creating a more humane and emotionally literate society. I believe we will gradually move away from only treating emotional problems to preventing them. That will be the new challenge for psychotherapy.' </p> <p>Even as it struggles to clean up its act with regulation, research and accountability, it's easy to be cynical about therapy. The arguments against its theories and practice are compelling - many of them apply at least in part to most therapies. But lined up against them are the men and women who went into that quiet room and came out feeling more whole, able to be better parents, lovers, friends or workers. </p> <p>'Good' therapy has been difficult to describe or define, but don't think it doesn't exist. In a world of watered-down psychobabble, the real thing can still have transformative effects.</p> <p><b>Types of psychotherapy</b></p> <p>There are three main schools of thought: psychoanalysis, cognitive therapy and humanistic therapy. </p> <p><b> Psychoanalysis</b> Based on the work of Freud, the essence of psychoanalysis is that people's problems stem from traumatic childhood events. Patients talk about themselves while the therapist listens and says very little. It aims to bring about a patient's greater understanding of themselves, and is less oriented towards change than other psychotherapies. Treatment can take years, and patients meet their therapist as frequently as every day, though once or twice a week is more usual. </p> <p><b> Cognitive therapy</b> This works on the basis that emotions can be the product of particular thought processes. It involves talking about the connections between ideas and feelings with an emphasis on unrealistic thoughts, and focuses on the present rather than the past. Patients often carry out 'homework' between sessions and keep a diary. The length of treatment is negotiated at the beginning. The initial period is usually 10 weekly sessions. </p> <p><b> Humanistic therapy</b> Better known as 'counselling', it is based on the theory that people need supportive therapy to encourage them to face problems. The duration of treatment is negotiated at the start: 10 sessions is usual. The counsellor encourages the patient to think about familiar situations in a different way, or prompts the patient to reassess problems. </p> <p><b>Finding a therapist</b></p> <p> Do some research. There are innumerable types of therapy and therapists, and the better informed you are, the more appropriate your decision will be. Libraries and the specialist organisations mentioned below are good places to start. </p> <p>Ask your GP for a referral. There are all kinds of therapists available on the NHS, but priority is given to the most serious cases. Waiting lists may be long, and the number of sessions may be limited. Your GP can also make private referrals. </p> <p>Ask friends to recommend somebody. Many people find a therapist through personal recommendations, but remember the importance of 'fit'. </p> <p>Make sure your therapist is properly trained. Psychoanalytical psychotherapists should be accredited by either the British Confederation of Psychotherapists (BCP) or the UK Confederation of Psychotherapists. </p> <p>Most private therapy sessions last one hour (50 minutes for psychoanalysts) and costs vary enormously depending on the kind of therapy you are having, the skill and experience of your therapist. Expect to pay between \u00a330 and \u00a350 per session. </p> <p>The BCP publishes a register of psychotherapists (available in libraries or, for \u00a330, from: The British Confederation of Psychotherapists, 37 Mapesbury Road, London NW2 4HJ).

It's also the name of the album's first track, the story of a nonstop three-night bender in Paris and London which the duo enjoyed two years ago. The first few copies of the album, Everyone Loves You, Everything's Free , come in a limited- edition, mirrored CD case complete with rolled-up note. As you may have guessed, it's about a certain lifestyle: about celebrity parties, guest lists and free champagne, about bright cocaine nights and the dark, empty comedowns that inevitably follow. For Pizzey especially, it's an intensely personal record. You could say he'd been researching it most of his life. </p> <p> Tuesday, 8.30am, Eurostar terminal at Waterloo. Pizzey is in his element. He has friends to entertain, strangers to charm, a party to organise. He's telling stories and jokes, cheerfully moving passengers around our first-class carriage so that we can all sit together, trying to persuade everyone to stay the night in Paris and go out. Meanwhile, he's on the mobile with his record label, trying to persuade them to hold the launch party for his album on a yacht in Ibiza. </p> <p>Annie Leibovitz is undertaking a marathon shoot for the September issue of US Vogue: 12 fashion designers with the friends who inspire them, shot in several countries over a period of 16 days. Pizzey, Trish Simenon and Annabelle Neilson are going to Paris to be photographed with John Galliano; Pizzey's girlfriend, the radio and TV presenter Lisa I'Anson, has come along to shop; I'm just there for the ride. </p> <p>From the Gare du Nord, a limo whisks us to the opulent restaurant where the shoot is to take place. An army of Vogue stylists and a rack of gorgeous Dior dresses is waiting. Galliano himself arrives straight from the airport at 5pm; Healy, who has provided the soundtrack to every catwalk show the designer has produced since his graduation, has flown in sleepless from Mallorca, where he has been playing all night at the vast BCM club; celebrity party organiser Fran Cutler and her sister Charlotte have come in from Ibiza, where they've been visiting Fran's business partner, Meg Mathews, at her home on the island. </p> <p>As they finally settle down for the shoot, they are asked to act like there's a party going on. It's no great stretch. Most of this group have known each other for years, and were there for Galliano when times were tough and his talent wasn't so richly rewarded. There's a lot of banter, a lot of loud laughter. Leibovitz takes just 30 minutes to capture an illusion of late-night glamour, and then the real night begins. Taxis arrive to transport everyone to rooms at the swish Hotel Costes, then there's an hour by the pool and dinner at a hip new Moroccan restaurant. Late that night, I get a taxi home. Reaching for the fare, I realise it's the first time I've paid for anything all day. </p> <p> Jeremy Healy was born in Peckham, south-east London 'a restless spirit, full of vague, unspoken ambitions'. On the bus to school, he'd met George O'Dowd, from the nearby suburb of Eltham. They began going out together, dressing up, becoming faces in the emerging club scene, living in squats and getting their photos in the new style magazines. Inevitably, they both joined bands. Healy's band, Haysi Fantayzee, got a record deal by making a cheap video and sending out a sheaf of promotional photographs, making them one of the first acts to realise the power that image was to play in the MTV decade. They hit the charts in July 1982 with the gloriously titled 'John Wayne Is Big Leggy'. O'Dowd's band, Culture Club, got its first hit single two months later, but proved to have rather more longevity. Healy, meanwhile, moved from making records to playing them, becoming a star DJ in the small, enclosed world that was 80s clubland. The elite got into clubs for free, drank cocktails in VIP rooms, enjoyed trips to New York, Japan, Ibiza. At the time, this seemed the height of sophistication but, like so much about the 80s, it proved to be just an over-dressed rehearsal for the decade to come. When the acid-house boom took club culture mainstream, going out dancing became something all kids did, not just the strangely dressed ones. Suddenly there were cool dance clubs in every town and city in Britain, and then across the globe. </p> <p>When the scene exploded, Healy employed his friend Fran Cutler, to organise his bookings for him. She went on to start one of the first DJ agencies and is one of the people credited by disgruntled promoters for raising DJ fees up into the stratosphere. Some time around 1993, Healy challenged Cutler to book him somewhere absurd, somewhere new, and she sent him to a club in Norway just by the Arctic Circle. It was then, he said, that he began to understand that he could take his records and get paid to go anywhere in the world. </p> <p> Friday, 9pm, Seven - the restaurant above Home nightclub in Leicester Square. Pizzey is holding court, as he does every Friday, before hosting the night at Home's members' bar on the floor above. He is entertaining the close friends on his table with the story of his doomed attempt to enjoy a quiet New Year's break in Thailand with I'Anson. (It involves various celebrities, plus a man with a gun, a helicopter, and things the libel laws wouldn't allow me to even hint at here.) The club pays Pizzey to host the night, to invite his friends along, have a few drinks and a few laughs. He's too diplomatic to mention it, but before he got involved, the place was dead. To kick it off, Pizzey set up a few parties for famous friends, peaking with an event for John Galliano that saw 1,400 people pass through the bar - including the reigning queen of the London party A-list, Madonna. 'After that,' he says casually, 'it was pretty much up and running.' </p> <p> Amos Pizzey was born in west London. His father, an ex-naval officer, worked in television. His mother, Erin, a diplomat's daughter, founded the first refuge for battered women in Chiswick, bringing the issue of domestic violence out into the open. After they divorced, his dad lived in a flat in the basement of their home with various girlfriends, while Erin unofficially fostered a group of young men Pizzey grew up regarding as his half-brothers. All of them were black, all older than him: 'They were my role models, which is where my cultural confusion stemmed from. I didn't know it, but I had real problems being white at that time.' </p> <p>His liberal parents told him he didn't have to go to school if he didn't want to. So he took his education instead in illegal shebeens, following reggae sound systems. By the time he was 13, he was performing himself, a white boy improvising on the mic in fluent patois. 'I was pretty wild,' he recalls. 'I couldn't write, but I couldn't half rock the mic!' </p> <p>His sister's boyfriend, Mickey Craig, had also moved into their household, and invited Pizzey to join his group, Culture Club. Pizzey worked with them under the alias Captain Crucial. He was 14 and the band was just on the verge of pop success when his mother dropped her bombshell: they were moving to New Mexico. 'The next thing I knew, I was in the desert in Santa Fe. A white kid with dreadlocks, surrounded by cowboys. Not a good move.' For years, Erin Pizzey's life had been a battle. Against the local authority about overcrowding at the refuge. Against feminists, who first celebrated her, then objected to her analysis of the causes of domestic violence. And finally against the legal system, when she refused to reveal the whereabouts of a woman and child she'd smuggled to safety in France. </p> <p>Pizzey remembers being in court with people like Spike Milligan who had taken up his mother's cause, watching her get sent to prison. She was eventually released, but decided to leave Britain. 'It was a bad period,' says Pizzey. 'I'm very proud of my mother. But it wasn't great, a lot of it. She was under a lot of pressure.' </p> <p>In the next few years, they moved across New Mexico, to the Caribbean and then to Italy. By the time he was 16 he was back in London alone, with a fierce self-belief that he says was his mother's gift to him. With his half-brother Cass (now in Skunk Anansie), he formed an abysmal band called Dark Star. They recorded one demo, a calypso version of 'My Girl', and signed a massive record deal. 'I loved the 80s,' laughs Pizzey. 'They gave us a quarter of a million quid. I was 17, Richard Branson took me out to lunch and said, \"You're it, you're going to be the thing.\"' </p> <p>Pizzey didn't have a driving licence, but he had a Jag. And suits with shoulder pads so wide he had to go through doors sideways. They spent two years in the studio, but the resulting album was predictably dire, and the group was dropped. 'If we'd been successful, I would have been such a wanker,' says Pizzey philosophically. 'I mean, I'm a wanker now, but I've got a sense of humour. Taking yourself seriously and being a wanker is a different thing: that's Mick Hucknall.' </p> <p>Undeterred, he formed a rock band with Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey, and they were big in Japan for a while. By the time he returned to London, Ecstasy and house music had arrived, and Pizzey enthusiastically embraced the new scene. He'd known of Healy for years - Boy George had engineered a stand-off between the two over who had the most authentic dreadlocks - but finally they became friends, recording for O'Dowd's dance label More Protein. </p> <p>When Healy played in clubs, Pizzey would often come along to improvise on the mic over the records. It was on a club trip to Singapore and Bali with Healy at the start of the 90s that Pizzey met Melissa Ong, the woman he was to spend the next seven years of his life with. He took her to his swish hotel in Singapore to impress her; she laughed and told him that her father owned it. In fact, her family owns quite a few hotels, across the world. Along with a substantial oil business and a retail empire built around designer fashion. </p> <p>Although the 80s are often seen as the designer decade, the obsession with labels only became big business in the 90s, when entrepreneurs like the Ongs took an interest. At its peak, the company run by Melissa's mother Christina had the franchises to some 60 designer names including Armani, Prada, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein. She opened flagship stores for these labels across Asia, Australia - and, of course, in London, where she also opened the Metropolitan on Park Lane in 1997. A designer hotel very much in the mould set by Ian Schrager in New York, it had a small bar that the Ongs hoped would draw in hip Londoners as well as hotel guests. Since they wanted the bar to be exclusive, Pizzey advised them not to sell memberships. Instead, they gave them away. A thousand cards went out to carefully selected people, and the deluge began. </p> <p>'People are always going to fight if they can't get into something,' he shrugs. 'That's so London. It's just a small, red room, but the scenes that went on in there during the peak two years were just ridiculous.' </p> <p>For a while, it seemed that everyone who was anyone passed through the Met Bar. Fran Cutler and Meg Mathews hosted a night there. Models, actors, pop stars and their entourages partied there. 'It wasn't the celebrities, it was the people around them who started to fascinate me,' says Pizzey, explaining his inspiration for the Bleachin' album. 'They were all supposedly producers, directors, models, actors, but all they really did was bugle [cocaine] in the bar. But then you started to notice fall-out. Certain people would get rougher and rougher, their designer facade would slip and they'd end up hassling you for drugs. I found the whole period fascinating. It was the end of the century, there was an element of fiddling while Rome burns.' </p> <p> Monday, 7pm, yet another new cocktail bar, Zeta's, not far from the Met Bar. Pizzey is here with I'Anson, Healy with his Brazilian girlfriend Luciana Silva. We're meeting before the London Club and Bar Awards at the Hilton - a lavish, self-congratulatory affair that offers yet another illustration of how fast this industry has grown. It's being televised, so there's a short film clip before each award. Pizzey guides us on a tour of some of London's new bars before I'Anson comes on stage to present the Best Bar award to Piccadilly's 10 Rooms. Former EastEnders actor Sid Owen presents the Best Club award, reading out the list of nominees and announcing, 'I've been mashed in all of these places.' It goes to Fabric, and the lady who runs their VIP toilets steps up to collect it, joking that she's seen many of the audience lingering in her cubicles. </p> <p>Meanwhile, from the numbers shuttling to the toilets in groups, the hotel's staff could be forgiven for believing they were at a support night for the chronically weak- bladdered. </p> <p> There's another story to the Bleachin' album, one that is told in the final four tracks, where the titles are less celebratory: 'Comedown', 'Fragile', 'Ambulance' and 'Learn to Cry'. It's the story of the lows that always accompany chemical highs, of the many who lost their souls for a line of white powder. But more specifically, it's the story of Pizzey's nephew Keita. Pizzey's sister Cleo was 15 when Keita was born; the father, Mickey Craig, was two years older. Pizzey talks about Keita as a brother, or a son. 'We slept in the same bed because he got scared at night. I changed his nappies, and he always looked up to me 'way too much, I can see now.' </p> <p>Keita came to clubs when Pizzey performed, and had some talent as a rapper himself 'at one point, there was talk of him signing to Boy George's label. Like many clubbers, he got into Ecstasy. Unlike most, he started hearing voices. Gradually, the Pizzeys began to realise he was seriously ill, and discovered that paranoid schizophrenia ran in his father's side of the family. Pizzey spent a lot of time just talking to him, 'really out-there conversations when he'd hear voices talking to him in records and say me and him were here to fight aliens'. Pizzey got him into The Priory for a while, and Keita went through various NHS schemes without ever getting consistent help. Mostly the family was left trying to deal with his illness alone, his mother and grandmother taking turns to care for him. </p> <p>When he asked for money, Pizzey said he'd buy him food, clothes, anything he needed, but he wouldn't give him cash to buy drugs. One day Keita mugged an old lady. When he was chased, he ran to his own home and sat inside the front door, crying, until the police came. At the station, Keita said he was a danger to himself. The police followed procedure, putting him in a shared cell, checking on him every 15 minutes. But then he was transferred to Wandsworth Prison for the night and, by morning, he was dead - hanged in his cell with his laces. </p> <p>Pizzey blames himself for Keita's death. He didn't take drugs with his nephew, but he has never hidden the fact that he does take them. He thinks he's got away with a lot in his life, by being physically fit, by having good friends, by having places he could go to escape and clean out if it all got too much. He wonders if everyone will be as lucky. 'I think the drugs fallout will be massive over the next few generations, because we're doing shit that we've got no idea about.' </p> <p> Saturday, noon, The Dior couture show at L'\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. On a balcony high in the roof, Healy is pacing about nervously. His music is playing: a simple four-note sequence repeated again and again, punctuated by the crack of a whip and a woman moaning in sexual ecstasy. Below, Steven Spielberg is sitting with his wife Kate Capshaw on one side, Elle Macpherson on the other, brilliantly managing to affect natural-looking conversations with both despite the photographers who surround them in an arc, flashbulbs popping. There's a hush as the show starts with a man in an ornate, feminine bishop's costume, followed by characters from a lavish, yet slightly sinister wedding. As each model moves along the catwalk, the music changes to match the mood. Healy has spent four days in Paris talking through the ideas with Galliano, making the music fit his themes of dysfunctional families and sexual transgression. The final mix includes dance beats, film soundtracks, a stream of obscenities by American performance artist Karen Finlay, and Beethoven's ninth symphony. As always, it's the most exciting music Healy makes. </p> <p>There was a point when he became a symbol of DJ excess. A couple of years ago, he began to slow down. He'd been depressed, he realised, and needed to start enjoying music again, enjoying his life. 'Money isn't everything. Unconsciously, I'd focused so much on my career - and I never thought I would even utter that word - that I was travelling all the time. If you're not around when people phone, after six months no one's going to call you. Success made me quite a lonely person.' Healy's daughter, Marley, was born in 1991. It wasn't something he'd planned, and it didn't make much difference to his life at first: 'I was never with the mother, never said I would be.' But then Marley's mum died. Suddenly, unexpectedly. (In the context of this feature, it seems relevant to say there were no drugs involved.) So Marley came to live with Healy for two days a week, and in their first year together, he finally became a father. 'To see the wonder in her eyes when I show her things is brilliant. It's lovely.' </p> <p>He recently moved into a new apartment in central London after spending months having it fitted to his specifications, yet he talks wistfully of a house he'd seen out in the suburbs, a big house with room for a swimming pool that he says would be lonely without a family to fill it. For now, though, Marley lives in Ibiza with her mother's best friend, who is bringing her up with her own children. Healy doesn't see her as much as he'd like, and he still seems surprised at how painful that is. 'I hope to take on more, to get closer and closer to her. It's difficult, because apart from the summer, I can go two or three months without seeing her, and that tends to hurt. You have to get to know them again, and it takes time to get to that place with them again. That idea of a family may be corny, but to not have that is a lot harder to deal with than to have it. And not to have your daughter with you when you want her to be_ That's one thing I haven't got, and it's about the only thing in my life that could have been worked better.' He pauses then laughs, almost embarrassed. 'But everything else has worked out quite good.' </p> <p> Saturday, 8pm. There's a car waiting at Waterloo. I drive with Healy to his new home. In two hours, he'll leave again to play at a club in Watford. Then it's back to London, where he'll DJ at another club until 5.30am. The next day, he'll fly to Mallorca for another all-nighter, followed by his weekly residency in Ibiza. There are far worse ways to make a living, of course, and Healy certainly isn't complaining. Nonetheless, it's a relentless schedule. Everybody loves you, nothing comes free.</p>",
  "I have three children. They've all got fairish hair and blueish, greyish eyes, but they're far from identical. One likes eating bacon with her fingers and dipping everything in Sainsbury's hot tomato pickle. One has just turned vegetarian. The other would eat rice, baked beans and pears every day of his life. One draws exquisitely, one does it with more imagination than control and one doesn't bother. Two are colour-blind, one isn't - it's a male thing, but it's inherited through the female line, so it will stop with the two (colour-blind) boys but carry on through the (non-colour-blind) girl. And two are right-handed, like me and their mother. The youngest is left-handed. Which means, according to stories I keep seeing, that his life expectancy is five years less than his brother or sister. <p>Today is International Left-Handers Day. Alexander the Great was the first one on record, though the Bible tells us that Benjamin's army included a 700-strong group of left-handed slingshotters. It's a strictly human thing. There are no 'left-handed' dogs, horses or hamsters. 'Human-handedness,' wrote KA Flowers in The Oxford Companion To The Mind , 'appears to have developed along with, and to be a feature of, man's uniquely high level of finger dexterity and capacity to make and use tools.' Anthropologists think it emerged in the lower Stone Age. </p> <p>Some 100,000 years later, there are said to be 600m left-handers in the world today, though that's the roughest of rough guesses. Estimates range as high as 36 per cent of the population and as low as 3 per cent, though an ultrasound study of babies in the womb by Queen's University, Belfast, produced a probably accurate 85/15 split. Handedness certainly begins in the womb - about 18 per cent of 'identical' twins display a left/right split. </p> <p>But while some scientists have suggested that it is a result of prenatal trauma, Dr Amar JS Klar thinks it's genetic. According to his research, published a couple of months ago, 80 per cent of the population is born right-handed and among the remaining 20 per cent there is a 50-50 chance of being left or right - the split works according to the classic Mendelian genetic model for recessive and dominant genes. That is, if you inherit one 'left' gene, you'll be right-handed. Inherit two and you may be 'left'. </p> <p>There are almost certainly more left-handers in Britain than there used to be - probably because we are not so prejudiced against them as we used to be. By and large, for example, left-handed children are no longer forced to write with their right hand. More of them are male than female - men are about 50 per cent more likely to be left-handed than women. Recent research into this has focused on testosterone levels in the womb. Male foetuses produce more testosterone than female and scientists think an excess of it may slow the development of the left side of the brain - which controls the right side of the body. It is also true, though, that all kinds of 'abnormality' are more common in men than women. </p> <p>So what are the health implications of being left-handed? And what does it mean for my youngest son? At first look, the research is not so much inconclusive as strangely incomplete. After a while, some kind of pattern begins to emerge. It's related to our brain's bipolar structure. The use of language is generally the preserve of the left hemisphere. Most lefties have a smaller brain area devoted to language. </p> <p>How does this affect them? Let's start with that most sophisticated use of language: lying. A 1997 experiment by Dr Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire involved 4,900 respondents and revealed a statistically significant difference - lefties are less able to discern when they're being lied to. </p> <p>Why? The guess is that lefties either have less language-specialist grey stuff or make less efficient use of the language-specialist left hemisphere; they are simply not so good at making sophisticated language calls. They are more likely to suffer from that most notable of language misfunctions, dyslexia. They're also more likely to stutter - George VI had both conditions. There is a higher risk of mental illness, including schizophrenia. And they are more likely to be the victim of accidents of various kinds. Canadian psychologist Stanley Cohen claimed that left-handers are 25 per cent more likely to have an accident at work. Studies of A&amp;E departments show a disproportionate number of lefties, according to Lauren Milsom of the Left-handers Club - she's one, she's married to one and they have a pair of leftie children. 'Basically, that's because we're left-handers in a right-handed world,' she says. That's true. In essence, existence is right-handed. </p> <p>The double helix of DNA is 'right-handed' - that is, it spirals in a counter-clockwise direction, like a wood screw. 'Kitchen equipment is the cause of many home accidents, and it's all set up for right-handers. Not that we ever admit that it's a problem. We accept that scissors don't cut for us, they bend and tear. We get on with it. We don't have an alternative.' She is now associated with Anything Left-Handed, a shop in London where you can buy left-handed scissors and the like. 'When you do finally get to use the correct tools,' she says, 'it's a revelation. It's like going from a beaten-up old car where only three gears work to a brand-new Mercedes.' </p> <p>Lefties have a problem with cars, too. They get killed in them more. Well, American ones do, according to research. The assumption here is that, in panic situations, we pull the wheel with our dominant hand. In the US, a leftie doing that will pull themselves into oncoming traffic - not the case here, of course. </p> <p>There is also research which purports to show that left-handers are more likely to be homosexual. So does that mean my son is more likely to, as they say, dress to the left? 'That was a very small and badly conducted study,' says Lauren Milsom. A recent article in Psychological Bulletin disagrees. Collating many different studies, it concluded that gay men are more likely to be left-handers - at least in America, where the research was concentrated. </p> <p>Will my son die younger, then? Well, no. The original research, conducted by Dr Stanley Cohen of the University of British Columbia, drew on baseball records - where handedness is always noted. As he went back through the decades, he discovered fewer and fewer left-handers. He deduced this was because they died younger. When a British team reproduced his research with cricket players, they came up with the same result. Then it was pointed out how our tolerance of left-handers has changed over the last century. The results were re-analysed and it was discovered that lefties lived as long as the rest of us. 'We all breathed a deep sigh of relief,' says Lauren Milsom. </p> <p>So are there any advantages in being left-handed? Well, it's better for writing on a blackboard. And it's better for some sports - though lefties are banned in polo and jai alai, on safety grounds. Left-handed boxers, cricketers, baseball and tennis players seem to have distinct advantages over their right-handed colleagues or competitors. Some say that's because right-handers have less experience of lefties than vice versa. </p> <p>Recent research, though, suggests there's more to it, that it's another effect of brain bipolarity. Left-handers may react faster because certain neural impulses don't have to make the nanosecond cross-brain journey - which may be why lefties are better at returning the 120mph tennis serves that, according to the laws of physics, no one should be able to see. </p> <p>So it's off to the tennis court, then, with my little one. Or maybe a game of football. Given the England team's inability to find even a half-decent left-footer for Euro 2000, Long John Silver could probably have made the squad if he'd been a leftie.</p> <p> <b> Grasping left-handedness</b> </p> <p> Nearly all cultures associate left-handedness with varying degrees of nastiness. Right is right and the rest is left - a word that originally meant 'weak' and 'worthless'. In Roget's Thesaurus , left-handed leads us to 'oblique', 'insincere', 'clumsy' and 'insulting'. A left-handed compliment is back-handed, a left-handed sugar bowl is a chamber pot, a left-handed wife is a mistress and a left-handed marriage one of social unequals. Catholics are left-footers, though they call themselves 'right-handers'. Sinister comes to us from the Latin for left. Gauche is our direct 18th-century adoption of the French word for it - and that comes from gauchir , which means 'warp'. Cack-handed - an old synonym for left-handed - means, quite simply, shit-handed. An echo of the Muslim ban on eating with the 'unclean' left hand? </p> <p>The French, German and Dutch all share our right/good, left/bad perspective. Even history's beleaguered minorities have a thing against lefties. The Hebrew for a left-hander is eetair yad yemino - a person who is not right-handed. And gypsies use the word 'bongo', no relation to the African drums but Roma for 'evil'. 'All religions are united in one thing,' said Dr Amar JS Klar, disentangler of the left-handed gene conundrum. 'Their discouragement of left-handedness.' </p> <p><b> Where to get hold of left-handed things</b> </p> <p> \u0095 Anything Left-Handed, 57 Brewer Street, London W1 (020 8770 3722) <br> \u0095 Lefties Guitars, Holiday Music, 579 High Road, Leytonstone, London E11 (020 8556 3000)</p>",
  "The study of advertising and marketing began in the 1950s as a branch of psychology. Since then, the questions surrounding it have been framed in terms of what they, the hidden persuaders, are doing to us, the passive consumers. Most of us still tacitly assume the relationship to be one of cause and effect. Academics speak of the 'self-immunity paradox': if you ask individuals whether they are swayed by advertising, they invariably say 'no', while insisting that the market as a whole is firmly in its sinister clutch. <p>If it ever really was like that, it certainly isn't now. Descend into London Underground and you'll find a postmodern war being waged, a grand dialogue with meanings and messages being subverted, distorted, or simply hijacked. In one poster, the TV chef Antony Worrall Thompson holds a cup of Nescaf\u00e9 above a caption which reads 'The Only Thing I Wouldn't Change', to which someone has added '... Is My Underpants'. This sounds infantile, but is effective. Suddenly the smug smile on Thompson's face becomes the look of a man who has accidentally swallowed a laxative pill that was intended for horses. The celebrity is put in his place. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the subversion is more explicit in its purpose. An ad for one of L Ron Hubbard's tomes on Scientology originally read 'It's not where you want to go... it's knowing how to get there.' In the same colour and typeface, an objector has attached 'without being brainwashed by money-grabbing Christians'. </p> <p>Perhaps the best-ever example of this type of action was perpetrated by the group Chumbawamba, who added 'dist' stickers to the infamous anti-drugs posters featuring an image of Leah Betts above the legend 'sorted'. Afterwards, it read 'distorted', which any thinking person knew to be nearer some kind of truth than the original had been.</p> <p>Animal rights campaigners have plastered L'Oreal billboards with propaganda stickers. An Easy Jet ad for flights to La Palma contains near-hidden details of a squatters' ball - obviously left in a pre-arranged place. Anarchists and fledgling dot.coms have stamped posters with web addresses in a spare, strategic manner that turns the rest of the advertisers' intended sales pitch into nothing more than background noise.</p> <p>Mark Ritson of the London Business School has been observing the new relationship between producers and consumers. He's spent time with anti-consumerist environmentalists and gay and lesbian activists and noted the rise of guerrilla advertising. He sees this activity as an extreme expression of the relationship we now all have to the marketeers.</p> <p>'What we're now realising is that there is an aspect of production in consumption, and it's far more complex than we thought before. We produce from our consumption, we're active. The question is how do consumers take this stimulus and integrate it into their own lives.'</p> <p>In the post-industrial economy, examples of this dialectic in action are not hard to spot. Tommy Hilfiger was a manufacturer of preppy, upscale leisure wear, until his wares were picked up as a badge of affluence by urban American hip-hop culture. Suddenly, unpredictably, the Hilfiger brand became edgy and 'street'. The particular group of consumers who adopted his gear had effectively been engaged in an act of creation - they had transformed it into something way beyond the imagination of the manufacturer. This does not necessarily fill a figure such as Hilfiger with unalloyed joy, incidentally: now urban black fashion has moved on and the upscale, white chaps won't touch him.</p> <p>Hardly anyone seems willing to admit that they're trying to sell you anything these days. This year, Diesel has been running an ad campaign based on a pop star named Joanne. The joke is that Joanne doesn't exist. They claimed to be making a statement about image and the ephemerality of marketing. What they were saying was, 'we know that you know that we're trying to sell you something. What's more, we know that you know that we know you know... but let's play the game anyway, we're on your side.' In the advertising industry, this is known as 'nudge-wink' marketing and it's causing some alarm, because it is based on the same 1950s assumption that advertising is about manipulation and will be resisted by smart people per se. </p> <p>Companies pour millions of pounds into creating strong brand identities that, once released into the world, become potent but difficult forces to control. Thus, road protesters remove the 's' from Shell so that it reads 'Hell' and campaigners for the legalisation of cannabis change the familiar Rizla brand label to say 'Ganja'. The truth is that commercial interests are helpless in the face of such subversion. This is why the writer Naomi Klein, in her book No Logo, refers to this type of action as 'political jujitsu'. Jujitsu is a martial art that aims to take the energy of an attacker and redirect it against his or herself.</p> <p>When did this start to happen? No one really knows, but if there was an age of innocence, it probably ended with the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon, who was the first prominent politician to try to harness advertising people to his cause as speech writers. In other words, Nixon has the dubious distinction of having invented spin. Oh yes, we've come a long way, baby.</p>",
  "<p>Premier Assets Research contacted a reader saying: 'We have recently discovered an asset which we understand may be due to you. It is held by Trustees pending your instructions and is valued at approximately \u00a34,000.' </p> <p>The firm offered to recover the asset for 25 per cent commission (plus VAT) - about \u00a31,000 in this case. </p> <p>The baffled reader, unable to find out about the missing asset without paying the fee, contacted Cash . We referred him to Shareholder Communications, which helps listed companies locate shareholders who have missed out on a share entitlement. It charges 10 per cent, but reveals the asset at the outset, enabling shareholders to deal with the share registrar and avoid the fee. </p> <p>For \u00a350, Shareholder Communications went through the reader's shareholdings and suggested that the asset may be a share in Southern Electric, which merged with Scottish Hydro in 1998 to become Scottish and Southern Energy. The reader had objected to the merger, and never got around to completing a form that would release the shares. The law requires dissenters' shares and dividends to be placed in a trust. </p> <p>The reader says: 'It is only my idleness combined with bloody mindedness in not wanting to accede to this merger, that has left shares in the dissenter's trust. It is a bit rich of Premier to offer to \"uncover\" these shares at such a high commission rate.' </p> <p>Scottish and Southern says: 'Premier Assets Research is not working for us. We have written to all shareholders on our dissenting register, saying we can do this all for nothing.' </p> <p>Premier declined to comment, saying that its policy is never to talk to the press. </p> <p>Premier's approach is completely legal, but before you agree to pay commission, check through your records to make sure you haven't lost track of some valuable shares.

One area of their finances which they would particularly like to sort out is their mortgage. </p> <p>Like many couples nowadays, both had already started buying their own properties before they met and married. So when they bought a joint home two and a half years ago, they decided to transfer the repayment vehicles they had been using previously to cover their new mortgage. In Caroline's case, this was a Norwich Union endowment which she had taken out in 1989 to repay her original \u00a335,000 home loan. Bill, on the other hand, had been advised to take out a pension mortgage with J Rothschild Assurance to cover his \u00a350,000 mortgage, as he was not a member of a company pension scheme at the time. To top up, the couple took out a further endowment for \u00a330,000 with J Rothschild for the increased mortgage on their new home. </p> <p>However, two years ago, Bill joined his employer's occupational pension scheme and ceased contributing to his personal pension. Caroline explains 'So far we have made no alternative provision for repaying that part of the mortgage and would like advice about what to do next'. Their current mortgage is a five-year fixed-rate loan (7.85 per cent) with the Halifax. They are halfway through the five-year period and though they have looked into getting a more competitive deal they found the redemption penalty on the current loan was too high and have decided to stay put. </p> <p>Caroline is also a member of a company pension scheme. She has been in her present scheme for the past 18 months and has transferred the value of pension benefits built up with her last employer over the previous four years into the scheme. 'When I joined my current scheme I also started paying maximum AVCs, realising I needed to boost my pension, especially as I am not sure whether I will always want to work full time.' At present, though, she is planning to return to work in January full time, or almost full time, after the new baby. </p> <p>Apropos the increasing size of their family, another area on which Bill and Caroline would like advice is life assurance. 'One thing we are not sure about is how much cover we really need' says Caroline. </p> <p>In terms of savings they currently have about \u00a3500 in an HSBC Tessa and about \u00a3500 in a Halifax account. They raided another account with Northern Rock recently to buy a new car. After Caroline returns to work next January and allowing for increased childcare costs, they expect to be able to save around \u00a3200 per month which they would like to put aside for the children with a view to the time when they will be going to university, 'or so we hope', says Caroline.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Gordon Wilson</strong></p> <p>Bill and Caroline should address the mortgage issue without delay. This is a good example of one of the main disadvantages of pension mortgages. For the debt to be repaid at the end of the term, not only must the pension fund be four times the size of the mortgage to allow sufficient cash to be withdrawn, the assumption is that your circumstances will never change. What makes matters worse in Bill's case is the transfer value of the fund is \u00a38,000 less than the fund value, a quite staggering penalty if he wants to transfer it. On its own, this pension fund will not be large enough to repay the \u00a350,000. A strategy is required to repay the mortgage, probably by age 60 at the latest. This could be achieved through a capital and interest mortgage. It is also important for Bill and Caroline to check that they have sufficient life assurance to repay the full mortgage amount of \u00a3115,000. </p> <p>As to other life cover, they need to work through a few 'what if' scenarios. Ideally, a list of all expenses should be drawn up to see what level of income is required to maintain the family. The cheapest way of providing life assurance is often by using term assurance. The term should normally be until the children have completed their education which could be about 23 years in their case.</p> <p>To illustrate the costs involved, \u00a3100,000 of term cover for 23 years on a joint life basis would cost around \u00a330 a month.</p> <p>Loans and credit cards tend to be expensive and should be cleared before saving. Caroline may also need to rethink her pension strategy on return to work in January. If she reduces her hours, she may become a basic-rate taxpayer which would make AVCs much less attractive. Individual Savings Accounts may be a more flexible option. Once these issues have been addressed, any surplus can be used to save for the children. Fidelity International is a well managed fund suitable for this purpose. Another alternative is Invesco GT's Rupert fund. </p> <p>\u0095 Gordon Wilson works for financial advisers Aitchison &amp; Colegrave. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Charles Levett-Scrivener</strong></p> <p>There are considerable issues which Caroline and Bill need to tackle. In deciding what action to take, priorities must be established. I would suggest with one very young child and another on the way, the first priority should be to have sufficient life cover both to repay the mortgage and provide an income for the children and surviving spouse. As a minimum, the cover should be 10 times the main breadwinner's gross salary plus sufficient cover to repay the mortgage. </p> <p>They also need to check the long term health insurance their employers offer. If they are not provided with this benefit, they need to arrange their own income protection insur ance, particularly for the main breadwinner. Caroline may have to wait until shortly after the end of her pregnancy before she can arrange these policies to ensure that no complications have arisen.</p> <p>They should contact the building society as soon as possible and request that part of the mortgage previously covered by Bill's personal pension be placed on a repayment basis. There should not be any early redemption penalty as a result of this new arrangement as only a small amount of capital will be repaid. The term should be arranged to coincide with Bill's retirement. Caroline and Bill should then concentrate on the repayment of their consumer debt before saving, particularly the credit card, as the rate of interest on this will be very high. The car loan rate of interest is also likely to be high but there may be quite steep penalties for its early repayment.</p> <p>After that, they should both focus on building up an emergency contingency reserve of at least three months' expenses plus a sum of money available for repairs to the car. If it is their intention to regularly replace the car they should be saving to build up the necessary funds for this purpose rather than taking out car loans. Only when all these issues have been addressed should they look at savings and investments for the longer term. </p> <p>\u0095 Charles Levett-Scrivener works for financial advisers Towry Law.</p>",
  "<p>I bought a dishwasher in October 1997 from Powerhouse, paying an extra \u00a325 for delivery and installation. When delivered, the driver said he could not install the dishwasher as, he said, the pipes were not the correct type. I have had dishwashers in the same spot for years. </p> <p>The Powerhouse manager told me to deduct \u00a310 from the final balance and said he would rectify it from his end. I paid the balance in April 1998, enclosing a letter explaining the \u00a3 10 difference. As far as I was concerned, that was the end of the matter. </p> <p>This May, GE Capital started taking money from my Nationwide account. They said I had underpaid by \u00a3 10 and this had accumulated interest, so I owed another \u00a3200. </p> <p>Powerhouse said their manager would never have told me to deduct the \u00a3 10. GE Capital will not listen. </p> <p>I am now getting threatening letters and phone calls harassing me at all hours. A debt enforcement agency says it might come to my home, and I have been told I am now on a bad debtors' list. Please help me.<br><strong>MM, Southampton</strong> </p> <p>With hindsight, you should not have taken the word of a store manager saying on the phone you could knock \u00a310 off the price without getting it in writing. This was never turned into a formal refund, which is why GE Capital expected the full price. You paid what you regarded as the full amount, \u00a3 249, in final settlement six months later, but GE Capital's computer expected another \u00a310, so started charging you interest on the whole amount from the day you bought the dishwasher. </p> <p>It deducted \u00a3 11 a month, but nothing left your bank account because the computer treated the \u00a3249 as advance payments towards the debt. GA Capital admits there is no logic in a customer paying all but \u00a3 10 deliberately, and says it has now changed the system to pick up such anomalies. </p> <p>Two years later, when the \u00a3249 ran out, the bank started taking money from your Nationwide account, which is the first you knew that something was wrong. When you then cancelled the direct debit, GE Capital, again automatically, treated you as a bad debtor and sent in the debt collection agency. </p> <p>The bank has now refunded the money taken from Nationwide, written off the interest charges of \u00a3 216 and is accepting the \u00a3 249 you paid as full settlement. Your name has been taken off the bad credit list. It intended sending a bunch of flowers as compensation but, when you rejected this, offered \u00a3 100. You felt this was too little; it is now sending \u00a3250. </p> <p><strong> Unhappy returns on turning 65</strong></p> <p>Since retiring, in 1994, I have not filled in a tax return. Now 65, I am eligible for age-related allowances, and was told that I will have to do a return every year, though nothing about my income has changed. Does this happen to everyone?<br> <strong>AG, London </strong></p> <p>If a tax inspector says you will have to fill in a return every year, you will. But, if it was someone else who said this, you should check. Whether or not you do depends on your circumstances, but you should not have to if your only income is the state pension, or private pension with small savings perhaps from Peps. Your local tax office can give you a definitive answer. </p> <p><strong> Not so Friendly after 28 years</strong></p> <p>My 82-year-old mother has insured her modest home contents with United Friendly for 28 years. She recognised that the weekly, at the door, premium collection was unlikely to continue and last year was happy to pay an annual premium of \u00a3 35.10. </p> <p>This year she was asked for a premium of \u00a365.10, because the company is 'increasing its efficiency'. When challenged, the premium was reduced to \u00a3 50. This appears a cavalier approach to customers of very long standing.<br><strong>PM, Bristol </strong> </p> <p>United Friendly reviewed all its policies last year and found some unprofitable, even after cancelling at-the- door collection. So, it says, it bumped up rates and improved terms. Those who complained were offered the \u00a350 'as a goodwill gesture'. </p> <p>Whether she could find cheaper insurance depends on her sum insured and her postcode. She has nothing to lose by acting on United Friendly's suggestion to try Age Concern for a quote. </p> <p><strong> Come up and see my collection </strong></p> <p>I am an old woman.

The fact that an accident victim has entered into correspondence with insurers is irrelevant.' </p> <p>Ah, says David Forster of Zurich: 'I assumed, because we were already progressing with her case, that she had already issued a writ against her employer.'</p> <p>The reader is claiming compensation on her employer's insurance with Zurich. The claim cannot be paid until she has proved in court that her employer was negligent.</p> <p>Forster says: 'Because she has been in extensive dialogue with us and because of all of the issues and our appalling behaviour in not dealing with her properly, there is absolutely no way that we would invoke any legal rights.

  "<p>Recovery funds are dead, long live recovery funds. That is to be the chant from M &amp; G, which is asking holders of its recovery unit trust to approve changes in its investment policy. </p> <p>On the face of it, the changes are minor. It is adding the option to buy companies 'whose future prospects are not fully recognised by the market' to its existing policy of buying companies which are in difficulty or out of favour. It is removing the requirement to sell following recovery or re-rating. And it now says that it will invest 'primarily' in such companies. </p> <p>The changes will make a big difference to the composition of the fund. They will give the manager scope to invest in a far wider range of shares, allow him to run with the winning shares and to invest in some of the racier areas of the stockmarket. </p> <p>The changes were prompted by the appointment of Tom Dobell as manager. But it also recognises that the recent pedestrian performance was at least partly caused by its restricted investment criteria. </p> <p>Launched in 1969, it is one of the oldest unit trusts around. Anyone lucky enough to have invested \u00a31,000 when it launched would now be sitting on \u00a3191,200. Later investors have been less lucky, however. Over the last 10 years, it ranked 141st out of 161 trusts in its sector and over the last year it comes in 258th of 301. </p> <p>Looking at its composition, that is hardly surprising. Technology stocks, despite remaining among the best performers over the last five years, account for less than 2 per cent of its portfolio while cyclical services, such as retailers and leisure companies, account for 25 per cent. </p> <p>John Hatherly, head of global analysis for the firm, says the aim is to 'reinvigorate and refresh' the recovery style and make its performance less volatile. Dobell's background has been in small company stocks so investors should expect the proportion of the fund invested in these - and particularly in technology - to increase. </p> <p>The changes may make the fund's performance less volatile in the medium-term. Short-term however, volatility could actually increase as the managers alter the portfolio to fit the new remit so new investors may prefer to wait a few months. </p> <p>Existing investors have to vote on the changes on 23 August. It would be sensible to support them.</p>",

People like the Chilean exile Ra\u00fal Ruiz, who has finally found an art-house audience here with Time Regained , and the 65-year-old Georgian, Otar Iosseliani. The latter's new film, Farewell, Home Sweet Home, his first to be shown here since Favourites of the Moon 15 years ago, is at the ICA and deserves a wider screening. </p> <p>The original title, Adieu, Plancher des Vaches! (literally 'Goodbye cow pen') is a sailor's traditional farewell to dry land, and the movie is about discontented people moving on to pastures new. Like the superior Favourites of the Moon , it's an absurdist fable in a Bu\u00f1uelian vein that recalls similar, carefully-patterned, multi-character films like Altman's Short Cuts and Anderson's Magnolia that impose an elaborate order on the apparent chaos of modern life. </p> <p>It is about what the German sociologist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies called Gesellschaft , a society characterised by individualism, self-interest, alienation, as opposed to Gemeinschaft , the old-style community based on mutual trust, shared beliefs and familial relationships. </p> <p>The characters are often viewed at a distance, their relationships never explained, their motives only hinted at, leaving us to work out what we are seeing. At the centre is a haut bourgeois family living in a chteau outside Paris. The mother is a businesswoman with artistic interests, a pet stork and a helicopter to take her to meetings. </p> <p>Her husband is a cheery alcoholic (played by Ios seliani himself) with a passion for sex, shooting and singing; her oldest child is a hard-drinking, teenage romantic who commutes to Paris by boat to work as a dishwasher and mix with criminals and clochards. </p> <p>One way and another, their paths cross with a dozen other people who themselves have overlapping relationships. So the film is less simply circular than La Ronde , more like a M\u00f6bius strip. Things change, some people get what they want, some get what they deserve, some achieve transcendence. It's a sad, quietly amusing, satisfying picture. </p> <p>Willie Morris's North Toward Home, a memoir of his Mississippi boyhood, university days and experiences as editor of the Texas Observer and Harper's Magazine , was published when he was just 32 and is one of the most attractive autobiographies of our time. He later settled back in Mississippi, where he died a year ago, writing books about the Southern experience. </p> <p>His bestselling My Dog Skip, which I haven't read, is apparently a fictionalised autobiographical work that has, one supposes, been further fictionalised by the screenwriter Gail Gilchriest. Set during the Second World War, it tells the tale of the nine-year-old Willie Morris and his attachment to his terrier, Skip, and how the dog helped him move from childhood to boyhood to manhood. </p> <p>The film introduces itself as a true story, but we know from North Toward Home that the Morris family had many dogs, not just this one, that Willie's father didn't lose a leg in the Spanish Civil War and that Willie played tricks on other people rather than having them played on him by school bullies. </p> <p>There's also a key sequence in which the young hero encounters menacing moonshiners in a cemetery that is a reworking of Huck and Tom's first meeting with Injun Joe in Tom Sawyer , a favourite book of Willie's. Still, for all the sentimentality, it's an attractive, warm-hearted picture, though I doubt if kids will go for it. </p> <p>For obvious reasons, the soundtrack of My Dog Skip is packed with golden oldies from the 1940s. Why the dreadful British comedy, The Wedding Tackle, should have a dozen 1960s songs by the likes of Kathy Kirby, Lulu, Dusty Springfield and Helen Shapiro on its soundtrack is a puzzle. But no more puzzling than how director Rami Dvir managed to obtain funding for this dire tale of four men on a stag-party pub-crawl round London. </p> <p>I would rather have walked to the South Pole with Captain Scott than have accompanied this lot.</p>",
  "The Edinburgh Festival is more than its sum total, an effervescence, an explosion, a raging torrent of need, a need for fusion, an alarm call or a call to arms.

Yes indeed, for now the empty cavernous churches, once thinly populated and sermonised by the shrill voices of dull dutifuls, are packed and restored to the church - the church of the stage. </p> <p>Yes, there is in this Festival an element of the preacher, the divulger of valued thoughts; the dissenter; lamentations on the state of man; burning issues; contentious views, passionate beliefs. We are gathered together to bond our values, to weave a giant tapestry of beliefs. </p> <p>The Festival, the guts and viscera of the Festival, is generally now in the Fringe, even in the street.

Not the sole place. Here can at last be revealed the actor. Stripped down. Bare. Unadorned. Unshackled. Hercules unchained. You have nothing to lose but your chains... </p> <p>On Monday morning, we enter the Assembly Rooms for the first time and check the space. </p> <p>We are forced to fight for the precious area of the stage since, unbelievably, much of it is used for storing the junk, props and detritus of the other shows. </p> <p>Naturally we carry nothing and have to pay the price. </p> <p>Eventually, we manage to claim our territory.

  "<p><strong> Rules of Engagement</strong> (127 mins, 15) Dir by William Friedkin; starring Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce </p> <p>Forty years ago Kenneth Tynan conducted a lengthy interview for The Observer with Jean-Paul Sartre, during which he asked if right-wing art was possible. Unfortunately, instead of saying la droite (the political Right), he said le droit (the law). Before he could correct himself, Sartre had taken off on an unstoppable spiel, beginning with the assertion that 'the law is theatre' and going on to show that 'the characters of Sophocles, of Euripides, even of Aeschylus - they are all lawyers' and that 'the stage is the courtroom'. </p> <p>When Tynan returned to the matter in hand, asking Sartre if 'an author of extreme right-wing views could ever succeed in creating a work of art', he received a plain answer 'in my opinion, no'. According to Sartre, as the Right no longer understood how the world functions 'one can't imagine a modern play that could be at the same time right-wing and good'. </p> <p>I thought of this exchange while watching William Friedkin's Rules of Engagement because as a courtroom drama it fulfils in the most literal way Sartre's definition of what constitutes theatre and also because it's arguably right-wing and unarguably pretty bad, though not without entertaining moments, mostly connected with the central performances. </p> <p>There have always been two streams of Hollywood movies about the armed forces - those made with the assistance of the army, navy or air force, which have constituted the majority, and those which have not sought, or have been denied, official assistance. Rules of Engagement belongs very clearly in the former category, as a somewhat extreme apologia for military conduct and thinking. It begins in the swamps of Vietnam in 1968 where a young black lieutenant, Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), saves the life of a fellow officer, Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), by committing a war crime. To compel a North Vietnamese colonel to call off his men bent on killing Hodges's isolated section, Childers murders a Vietcong prisoner-of-war in cold blood. This is what happens in battle, the film implies, and only a civilian would think it improper. </p> <p>The film cuts to 29 years later when both men are US marine colonels, one divorced, the other married to the corps. Hodges, a military lawyer of no great distinction (he's been behind a desk since being crippled in Nam), is on the point of retirement; Childers is on active service in the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>When a mob of Islamic fundamentalists threatens the American embassy in Yemen, Childers takes a platoon of Marines to the rescue, saving the ambassador and his family, but ordering his men to fire on the mob, whom he sees as an armed threat to his men, and 83 civilians are killed and more than 100 wounded. As a result he returns home not to a hero's welcome, but to a court martial with the possibility of receiving a death sentence. Improbably, he asks his old chum Hodges to defend him, rather than engaging a hot-shot civilian. </p> <p>Credit for the story goes to the film's executive producer, James Webb, who served as a marine officer in Vietnam before working as a lawyer, writer on military affairs and US Secretary of the Navy under Reagan. The screenplay, however, is by a television writer, Stephen Gaghan, and it is presumably he who has larded it with every clich\u00e9 in the book from the retired lawyer out fly-fishing when he's called back to the fray to the ridiculous bonding fight between old chums that ends in black eyes, bloody noses and laughter. </p> <p>There are the usual surprise witnesses, of course, as well as vital bits of evidence that suddenly turn up, though these are all acceptable aspects of the courtroom genre. More significantly, however, the audience is given nothing to ponder, evaluate, think about. We should be in the position of the seven marine majors who make up the jury. Instead, we're made privy to vital information that would not merely have been useful for the defence but would have prevented Childers from being indicted in the first place. </p> <p>The villains of the piece (worse than the Yemeni mob whom the movie views as so many towelheads) are a suave National Security Adviser (Bruce Greenwood), with a portrait of Jack Kennedy, on his wall and a cowardly US ambassador (Ben Kingsley), with a throbbing vein in his temple. </p> <p>But we aren't invited to assess their credibility as witnesses. We've already seen the ambassador act in a craven fashion in Yemen so we know he's a gross perjurer when he accuses Childers of losing his cool and enforcing the evacuation. </p> <p>We also see the Security Adviser, who's looking for a scapegoat to appease Middle- Eastern opinion, destroy a video from the embassy's CCTV surveillance camera that shows (rather unlikely this) that every man, woman and child in the mob had a concealed automatic weapon and fired on the Marines. This pair are contrasted with a newly discovered good guy, the Vietnamese colonel Childers had captured in the jungle 30 years earlier, and who now salutes his old adversary. </p> <p>Seeing this movie after the Republican Convention in Philadelphia is an unnerving experience. The presidential candidate avoided serving in Vietnam and his vice-presidential running mate had 'more pressing business' than doing his national service. Yet the party called in Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf and General Colin Powell to rouse the delegates. Do the producers of Rules of Engagement really believe that the American public is still hostile to the armed forces, and if so do they think that simplistic gung-ho movies that back the boys in uniform right or wrong are the way to restore confidence in the military? </p> <p>Another question about the film is raised by the final name on the cast list - talk show host - G. Gordon Liddy. What was the most right-wing member of the Watergate plumbers doing in this movie and why was he cut from the print being shown in Britain?</p>",
  "<p>Although he presents himself as an environmentalist guru, Al Gore has always been enthusiastic about genetically modified 'Frankenfoods' - and for many good reasons. One might be that he himself is a GM product. No man in the history of American politics can have been so carefully and deliberately groomed, moulded, deconstructed and reconstructed for the Presidential race for which Al 'GM' Gore presents himself at the Democrat convention, opening in Los Angeles tomorrow. </p> <p>When Gore arrived for his first day as a journalist on the Nashville Tennessean newspaper in the autumn of 1971, most staff knew he was no regular cub reporter. Gore was being packaged to them as the young man who had just returned from his stint in Vietnam - wearing his country's uniform although he bitterly criticised its war - now making his way in the world free from the overbearing family tradition of politics. In contrast to the cynical realpolitik practiced by his father, Senator Albert Gore I, Al Gore II had studied esoteric spiritualism. He was a decent enough reporter too - he pursued a local corruption case all the way to a court hearing (although the target was acquitted). </p> <p>But the package was a deceptive one. Had he really wanted to go into journalism, the Harvard-educated Gore could have walked into other, more prestigious newsrooms than that which happened to have been in his father's political back-pocket in Nashville. The editor of the Nashville Tennessean was John Siegenthaler, who employed celebrity interns who would enhance his own contacts in Washington. </p> <p>In Vietnam, Gore's father had been able to pull a few strings (although without such sordid efficiency as George Bush's) and secured Gore a job as an army reporter. Accordingly, he had been mollycoddled around, a safe distance from the action which he reported in vivid detail from second-hand accounts. 'Gore was not the journalist type,' recalls his former colleague on the desk, Phil Sullivan. 'It didn't seem like that was what he was setting out to do. Siegenthaler saw him as someone who was going into politics.' </p> <p>But although his colleagues knew exactly what he was up to, Gore himself could have had no idea that the more relaxed and apparently self-confident summer intern sitting at the next desk would, in two decades time, be the man to whom he would turn for yet another in the long series of makeovers that would define his career: Carter Eskew, 'message guru' of the current campaign, laboratory technician of the present-day GM Gore and Svengali of the LA convention. </p> <p>It is hard to know which aspects of Al Gore's life are fact and which are fanciful, or indeed whether there is any difference between the two. Gore himself plays along with the entwinement, turning even the rawest and most intimate moments of his life - such as his own son's scrape with death in a car accident - into theatrics, part of the electoral strategy. </p> <p>The packaging of Al Gore as President of the United States began when he was still in utero. On the day Gore was born, the Nashville Tennessean hailed the birth on page one: 'Well, Mr Gore, Here He Is', with the Knoxville News Sentinel adding only a year or two later: 'There may be another Gore on his way to the political pinnacle.' </p> <p>Gore grew up not in Tennessee but in what is now the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Embassy Row in Washington DC, attending an \u00e9lite prep school and spending summers on the tobacco farm in his father's home state. He played with a toy submarine in the Senate swimming-pool and bounced on President Nixon's lap. Albert Snr was a rags-to-riches, Scots-Irish politician, a New Dealer unafraid of unpopular positing and ultimately defeated after an 18-year career only when Nixon unleashed a slush of illegal finance against him, as revealed by the Watergate papers. Like his son, he enjoyed taking the ethical high ground and like his son he betrayed it. But it was Gore's mother, Pauline, who claimed the initial packaging of her son - 'I trained them both,' she said of Alberts I and II, 'and I did a better job on my son than I did on my husband.' </p> <p>The most striking thing about packaging Al Gore is the regularity with which it happens and the extent of the metamorphoses. The most dramatic was the apparent conversion from new-age eco-catastrophist to Vice-President in 1992 and, more recently, from a woodentop with as much political razzmatazz as a traffic jam to something from Sopranos central casting. </p> <p>The task in 1992 was particularly daunting and almost effective. Gore pre sented a curious figure at the time, as expressed in his book, Earth in the Balance . It was published at a time when politicians were full of foreboding about the various apocalypses of global warming, over-population and ozone-depletion and making routine pilgrimages to the Amazon rainforest. </p> <p>Gore had been understandably affected by his son's narrow scrape with death after a car hit the child as the family was leaving a Baltimore Orioles baseball game. He had immersed himself in alternative psychotherapy, new-age thought and the fad philosophy of Gaia, popular among right-wing eco-catastrophists, suggesting that the human race is merely part of a single, natural organism. </p> <p>'It cannot be accidental,' wrote Gore in one of his more wayward passages, 'that the percentage of salt in our bloodstreams is the same as the percentage in the oceans of the world.' Gore laments mankind's alienation from this natural order, putting the blame squarely on Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Quite apart from its intellectual absurdity, Gore's position had two curiosities: the fact that it did not put off the embryonic Clinton administration and its brazen disingenuousness. </p> <p>On his 1998 tax return, Al Gore lists a $20,000 royalty payment from the Union Zinc Company for the right to mine zinc on his farm in Tennessee. The income, which has netted Gore $450,000 over the years, is the legacy of Gore Snr's lucrative relationship and joint ventures with fraudulent tycoon and Soviet agent, Armand Hammer, also chief executive of the environmentally controversial Occidental Petroleum Company. Among other ironies, Hammer was caught making illegal contributions to Nixon, used to topple Gore Snr. Hammer and Gore Snr enjoyed a two-way deal: Hammer boasted that he had Gore in his 'back-pocket'; he found protection from anti-communist investigations and open doors in Washington; Gore Snr secured campaign funds, a six-figure directorship upon retirement and donations for his son's Congressional campaigns. </p> <p>After hosting Gore and Tipper at innumerable parties, and being Al's guest at Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1987, Hammer died in 1990. But the $20,000 a year was a handsome supplement to what Gore complained were 'slave wages' on the Tennessean , and still listed in 1992 as his most important source of income after his salary, now eclipsed by the $1.1 million in royalties from Earth in the Balance . </p> <p>The relationship between Gore and Occidental has remained a mutually advantageous one. Occidental loaned $100,000 to the Clinton-Gore inaugural committee in 1992, and has donated some $500,000 in 'soft money' to the Democratic Party since Gore made it on to the ticket. </p> <p>This was the administration-in-waiting that decided it needed Al Gore on the ticket. When he took the initial call from scout Warren Christopher, Gore was attending the Rio Earth Summit in 1991, waving his copy of Earth in the Balance . Baby-boomer Clinton liked the generational chemistry with Gore, and the Vietnam 'record' which, on paper, contrasted with his own. Gore appealed to the 'new Democrat' right wing for a number of reasons. He had been recruited by the party as an attack dog to see off Jesse Jackson's candidacy in 1988 and had done a good enough job. Even then, Clinton also needed someone with a stable marriage to offset his embarrassment over Gennifer Flowers. </p> <p>Gore was duly put through the mill, drilled into shape even by people who disliked him at the political core of Clinton's campaign: Hillary, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. He was worked over by speech coaches and a ballet choreographer, who counselled him on his awkward movements. The wrathful impatience with conventional politics sketched in Earth in the Balance was silenced as the book became the first ever bestseller that a publisher refrained from pushing. Clinton liked the volume, but Carville, Harold Ickes and the realists on the party's Left, trying to win an election, found it insane at best, scary at worst. Gore the Rainbow Warrior duly became Gore the Vice-President. </p> <p>But what kind of packaging was it? The nadir of Gore's life-as-theatre came at the party convention in New York that year, Gore's 'coming-out' event. He told the delegates and viewing millions how he had watched Albert Gore III 'fly 30 feet through the air and scrape along the pavement... I ran to his side and held him and called his name... his eyes were open with the nothingness state of death'. Gore was reading every word off the autocue. </p> <p>The history of Vice-Presidents assuming the top office is a patchy one, as Pauline Gore must have realised when she expressed coded disapproval of her son's supporting role to the 'provincial' Bill Clinton. It was a concept in promotion pioneered by the shock of Truman's takeover from Franklin Roosevelt and L.B.J.'s even more dramatic succession of J.F. Kennedy, but these were without preparation. It worked differently in the more ambitious cases of Nixon, first of the 'modern' Vice-Presidents, and George Bush. </p> <p>A year ago, a lifetime of grooming 'Veep' Al Gore for the presidency seemed doomed to failure. A bumper sticker appeared: 'Stuck in Traffic? Blame Al Gore'. Gore had creased the nation's sides by telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer he had 'taken the initiative in creating the internet'. Hillary Clinton's candidacy in New York created a Medusan triangle inside the White House with resentments in all directions. Most importantly, Gore was making instantly and utterly forgettable speeches: 'Gore' was spelled with a 'B'. </p> <p>A Wagnerian family psychodrama was playing out between Clinton and Gore - 'father' and 'son' - which was, with hindsight, crucial to Gore's selection of running mate last week. Throughout the Lewinsky scandal, Gore had walked a high wire between loyalty and disgust. Apart from Hillary, he was the most senior victim of the President's deceit but also had the highest honour under Clinton's patronage to betray if he abandoned him. </p> <p>Gore's political father (Clinton) finally blessed Gore's ambition to become President in 1998, the year that his actual father died, thereby turning Clinton's political paternity into something more complex. Gore always knew that his success lay in the passing of power by both to him, as George Bush Snr has done to his son. But there was a problem - the motives of both Gore's father figures were entirely narcissistic. One wanted a President Gore who would bear the family name in the White House, the other a President Gore to rescue his legacy from the stains on Monica's dress. </p> <p>In his hour of need, Gore was shunned by the surrogate father in a way he never was by Albert Snr. Out of the blue, Clinton made an unsolicited call to the New York Times, making clear his displeasure at the way Gore was conducting his campaign. On the morning his remarks were published, the atmosphere in Gore's White House office was one of 'stunned disbelief'. Meanwhile, down the corridor, Gore had been shut out of the huddle that gathered around the President to discuss the advisability and fallout of the Times interview. Gore's retort came sharp enough. He told Diane Sawyer he thought Clinton's behaviour during the Lewinsky scandal had been 'inexcusable... especially as a father'. </p> <p>Gore assembled a team with specific instructions - to repackage him again, almost from scratch. One source told The Observer that Gore himself even admitted privately that 'I would not vote for the Al Gore I read about'. A war council was convened by the new campaign director, Tony Coelho, a former Congressman dogged by allegations of embezzlement and scandal, to do just that. With Coelho was Bob Shrum, former wordsmith for Teddy Kennedy who will have written Gore's sink-or-swim Los Angeles speech; Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schriff, and wife, Tipper; Eskew and stringent political director Donna Brazile, who acted as pastor and conscience to the otherwise devious bunch. </p> <p>According to one present at the meeting, the message was to 'free Gore from his office and from the White House' - to declare UDI from Bill and Hillary. Gore moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to his supposed 'roots' in Tennessee. The move was also a good way to cull a troubled, squabbling staff, to sort out the wheat prepared to sacrifice everything to follow him from the chaff who preferred to stay around their DC dinner tables. Brazile added a trial by salary, cutting everybody's by two-thirds. Gore and his senior staff remained in the comfort of Washington. </p> <p>Diane Sawyer conducted the first TV interview in Tennessee with Gore and Tipper on his late father's tobacco farm. Gore wore jeans and cowboy boots. Sawyer threw the first pitch, a fastball. Her grandmother, she said, who was in tobacco farming, wanted to ask: how many strains of tobacco are there in the US? Gore stared back blankly, a look of wounded hatred in his eyes. The second question was about the maintenance of fencing between two properties; Gore was equally clueless. </p> <p>Addressing the crowds at his launch rally in Tennessee, Gore pledged to 'take my own values of faith and family to the Presidency' and promised: 'If you entrust me with the Presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for America's family.' It was a brazen slap in Clinton's face. Gore's campaign hit the road with speeches luxuriating in the strong economy, but barely mentioning Clinton. He needed to share in the President's public successes (and stubborn popularity among Americans) while denouncing his private failings. </p> <p>Winter came, and the packaging team devised a new, folksy Al Gore who stopped talking about 'livability' and held town meetings and his audience to raise their hands until he had identified who had the most grandchildren. As the jester of American politician-watching, Professor Todd Gitlin at New York University, puts it: 'The difference between Bush and Gore now is that Bush is fake trying to be real, while Gore is real trying to be fake.' </p> <p>But even the 'fake' package had trouble selling himself. Gore was tainted by the Russian money-laundering scandal. A photo opportunity in a canoe backfired when it emerged that 170 million gallons of water had been released to stage it, during a drought. Bill Bradley was making headway he simply didn't deserve. Coelho's tyrannical style was driving the team to distraction to no effect; he was hardly the Carville figure the campaign so obviously needed. There was bitter internal strife between one-time partners Eskew and the (now late) Bob Squier, policy adviser. The two men had once run a consultancy together but their combined presence on the Gore campaign was, said old White House hand Dick Morris 'like asking the Albanians and Serbs to work together'. Then came a final split from Bill, a bit of the sex appeal and the final makeover. </p> <p>The Gores had decided that marital bliss was the key to the post-Monica era, but now they added a bit of libido to their version. On stage, Tipper would summon him with a wave of her hand, saying: 'He's so sexy', and he would respond: 'I love it when she beckons me with her finger like that.' The chic feminist Naomi Wolf was recruited to refurbish Gore's wardrobe and promote his sexual chem istry from what she labelled 'Beta to Alpha' grade. </p> <p>It seemed to work. Brazile's puritanism played counterpoint to this flippancy. Gore became almost a control freak over his campaign, designing his own logos and websites. The result appeared on television during the New Hampshire primary opposite Bill Bradley. To the nation's amazement, Gore suddenly looked hunky, like a football quarterback dressed as a small-time Mafiosi. He was confident yet relaxed. </p> <p>Gore has since applied the new style to new crusades, none more virulently than that against America's drugs and medicines industry. Gore lambasts the pharmaceutical companies for 'gouging the consumer unfairly' and claims credit for a recent industry retreat in agreeing to allow South Africa and other countries to manufacture cheaper generic drugs to counter the Aids pandemic. But even this genetic modification is flawed because, as ever with Gore, it is disingenuous. Gore's claim that he pushed for the generic production of Aids medicines in South Africa is especially unconvincing. Last December, The Observer revealed the web of consultancies and lobbying that connected Gore to the major drug producers suing the South African government for trying to produce generics. </p> <p>This campaign is the final act in Gore's lifelong White House drama. The first scene has already been successfully played out: the overdue shedding of Coelho and his replacement by William Daley, a rough-cut professional and one of America's fourth dynasty after the Kennedys, Bushes, Gores, that of the past and present mayors of Chicago, Richard Daley Snr and Jr. If anyone can save Gore, it is Daley, as Gore must have known when he called him shortly after midnight to offer him the job. A groggy Daley said he'd like to think about it over a cup of coffee. 'OK,' replied Gore, 'go get your coffee and I'll hold.' </p> <p>The second scene was concluded last week with Lieberman's appointment. But this only complicates the third scene, which opens in Los Angeles tomorrow - that which is supposed to star President Al Gore, but in which President Bill Clinton will inevitably play centre stage. That was always the problem in packaging Al Gore - fathers. </p> <p>If this was Wagner, the aged, flawed Wotan would be standing at the foot of the mountain, spear in hand. Young Siegfried would slice it in half and Wotan would say: 'Pass on, for I cannot stop you.' But Al Gore Snr never taught his son how to use the sword, and neither did Bill Clinton. In the end, it was they who did the packaging, and neither was prepared, in the final hour, to be outshone by Al Gore.</p>",
  "<p>It was never like this in the Premiership for Watford, who discovered that defensive failings will not be punished by First Division teams as they were on the way to relegation last season. </p> <p>Graham Taylor's side were in disarray after gifting the opening goal to Huddersfield and offering the Yorkshire club enough opportunities to start with a confidence-enhancing victory. </p> <p>Huddersfield squandered every one and Watford made them suffer by scoring twice either side of half-time. But at least Taylor recognised that much of this season's allocation of good fortune had already been used up. </p> <p>'I would have been happy to get one point after our first-half performance,' he said. 'To finish with all of them is a footballing miracle.' </p> <p>To add to the miserable mood of Town's supporters, the chief miracle worker was Michel Ngonge, a player many of them hoped would now be a Huddersfield player. </p> <p>They wanted manager Steve Bruce to sign Ngonge after a successful stay on loan last season and applauded the midfielder generously when he went on as a substitute at the start of the second half. </p> <p>It was a nice gesture, regretted within a minute when Ngonge's first touch was a perceptive through-ball that Tommy Smith swept home to earn Watford a victory that looked improbable for all but the final minute of that one-sided first half. </p> <p>Espen Baardsen, the keeper Watford signed from Spurs, was given plenty of early warnings that uncertainty lurks within the defenders in front of him. </p> <p>This was confirmed after 15 minutes. Martin Smith's left-wing cross was fractionally too high for Clyde Wijnhard, but his presence was enough to distract Steve Palmer, whose header found the top corner as he stooped to clear. </p> <p>Town should have wrapped it up in the next 10 minutes. Steve Jenkins picked out Wijnhard with a 23rd-minute cross, but the Dutchman's firm header was kept out by Baardsen's legs. </p> <p>Then Kevin Gallen exposed an alarming gap in front of the keeper, who was beaten by a shot that struck the inside of the post, swerved across the goal and past the outside of the other post. </p> <p>Watford, reprieved and relieved, went on to an improbable success after an equaliser in the dying seconds of the half. It undoubtedly changed the interval atmosphere in the two dress ing rooms and Huddersfield keeper Nico Vaesen must take the bulk of the blame. </p> <p>Vaesen, expecting a cross when Neil Cox took a free-kick from the left flank, succeeded only in pushing the ball in after Cox drilled it towards the near post. </p> <p>Ngonge's arrival and Smith's goal made a mockery of Huddersfield's earlier superiority and, growing increasingly anxious, they were unable to rediscover it in the second half. </p> <p>Wijnhard, Vincent and Gallen were all off-target with long-range efforts and a strong penalty appeal was rejected. By the end, though, Watford were in control. Taylor said: 'Huddersfield can argue that the game should have been over at half-time, but that's not our fault.' </p> <p>It was precisely the argument employed by Bruce, but he also accepted: 'You make your own luck and it just didn't go our way. I thought we were a joy to watch for 40 minutes and should have killed them off.'</p>",
  "<p>Jan Molby's Harriers express, against a background of appreciative toots from trains on the adjacent Severn Valley Railway, began to make up for lost time at a packed Aggborough Stadium. </p> <p>Shamefully denied access to the Football League by the suits in 1994, Molby's team began their overdue journey in fine style - their football proving too much for a more physical Torquay side. </p> <p>That aspect of the Third Division had worried Molby before kick off and he was delighted with his team's display. 'We showed we can play a bit against a very good team who were unlucky not to reach the play-offs last season,' he said. </p> <p>'Obviously I don't want to get carried away because we're judged in May and not the middle of August. But we're entitled to enjoy today.' </p> <p>Molby will also have enjoyed the performance of two of his new recruits, Andy Ducros and Barry Horne, who scored a spectacular second goal to complete the victory. </p> <p>Ducros, the club's record signing at \u00a3100,000, was a constant menace to the visiting defence who were unable to get to grips with his role of withdrawn striker and it was his cross that set up Harriers' first chance. </p> <p>It fell to Paul Webb, who at 32 has given up a well-paid job as a warehouse manager to join Molby's adventure. He headed over, but Harriers' first League goal was not long in coming. </p> <p>It came from Stewart Hadley in the 15th minute, following spadework by Ian Clarkson and Scott Stamps. Hadley fired home from 10 yards and this part of Worcestershire erupted. So too did the Torquay defence, who felt the goal should have been disallowed for offside. </p> <p>At the heart of the protests was central defender Jimmy Aggrey, who became increasingly irate as he and his fellow defenders were given the run around and was predictably booked near the end. </p> <p>Torquay, though, were presented with some good fortune of their own in the 31st minute when the otherwise impressive Adie Smith slipped and gave the ball to Kevin Parker, who advanced on Harriers keeper Tim Clark. Initially Clark looked disinterested but he eventually reacted to thwart Parker with a diving save. </p> <p>It was to prove a costly miss for the visitors when Horne scored with a spectacular 25-yard volley to complete the victory.</p>",
  "<p>Hibs reached the top of the Premier League on the back of a performance that will cause the other 11 members to take them very seriously indeed. </p> <p>A game that could have been a classic between two talented and adventurous teams eventually became a lopsided mismatch after the Dundee striker Fabian Caballero was sent off shortly before the interval. It was Dundee's misfortune to have another player, Patrizio Billio, issued with a red card - the result of a second yellow - as stoppage time approached. </p> <p>Easter Road's regular customers can rarely have witnessed football as exhilarating as these two produced before the ordering-off that rather interfered with the over-all fluency. </p> <p>The dismissal was an unfortunate souring, the Argentinian swinging his forearm at the face of Mathias Jack after the German had completed a harmless tackle near the touchline. It appeared that Caballero expected to be hurt by the momentum of Jack's lunge, but in fact the latter took the ball and the Dundee man appeared to retaliate in anticipation, rather than as the result of being assaulted. </p> <p>The sadness of that dismissal was deepened by the memory of the goal with which Caballero had given a sweet-moving Dundee side their early lead. As Juan Sara, with his back to goal, played the ball out to Georgi Nemsadze just beyond the penalty area, Caballero bolted into the right side of the box. The pass was impeccable, allowing him to hit a ferocious drive into the far corner of Nick Colgan's net. </p> <p>That seemed a hard goal to match, but Agathe actually topped it with the first strike that levelled the score. Receiving the ball from Russell Latapy on the half-way line, the French striker shrugged off three challenges - each seeming likely to ground him - on his 50-yard run, ending with a cool side-foot finish low to the left of Robert Douglas. </p> <p>Agathe completed his double when Latapy's powerful run out of defence gave him the space to send another precise pass to the Frenchman in the inside-left position. This time he finished with a right-foot drive high to the left of Douglas. </p> <p>Sandwiched between these goals was an unconverted penalty from the home team, Latapy uncharacteristically giving Douglas a comparatively easy save with a weak shot to the goalkeeper's left, after Marcello Marrocco had lost control of the ball and stretched out a foot to trip Tom Smith. </p> <p>The difficulties of overcoming 10-man opposition quickly presented themselves as Hibs' previously incisive forward movement was rather blunted by visitors who were forced into a policy of containment - clearly one that was not suited to their cavalier instincts. </p> <p>But the third did arrive when substitute Dirk Lehmann, on for Paatelainen, headed the ball down and over the line from John O'Neil's right-sided centre. The German striker almost immediately completed his double by sliding a cut-back from Ulrik Laursen over the line from six yards. </p> <p>By the time another sub, Stuart Lovell, knocked in the fifth from close range, Dundee were discouraged, dismayed and in disarray.</p>",
  "<p> Kyrios Angelos laid off the booze and fags at 70. At 92, he's looking sharp. He sings to me, his fingers tracing the litany across an Orthodox Bible etched by a lifetime's use. It is dusk on 14 August and preparations for the eve of the Assumption are under way. </p> <p>Festivals on Skino\u00fassa - one of the tiniest inhabited islands in the Greek archipelago - don't come much bigger than the summer Panagyri . Its full name is the Apok\u00edmisis tis Panagyias , or Final Repose of the Blessed Mary. As prodigal offspring jet in from the far reaches of the Greek diaspora to celebrate the Virgin's assumption into heaven, the island embraces its extended family. These xenitem\u00e9ni (self-imposed exiles) are the legacy of sustained economic migrancy, and the sight of barnacled old men greeting their smooth-skinned brothers from abroad is peculiarly touching. For two weeks, this rock in the Aegean is transformed into a cosmopolitan microculture where 10-year-olds insist they like Skino\u00fassa because the crime rate is much lower than in Johannesburg. </p> <p>The name derives from the violent thorns ( sk\u00edna ) specific to its rough terrain, all four square miles of it. Part of a cluster of Minor Cyclades also known as the 'Islands of Solitude', it buffers the waves between N\u00e1xos to the west and Orthodox Amorg\u00f3s to the east. Here, the feudal and the modern nuzzle together. Windmills and satellite dishes and pylons score the horizon. </p> <p>What unites the crowds gathered for the Panagyri celebrations is a tenacious nostalgia for the nest they have flown. 'Don't you dig the lifestyle? Like these guys really know how to enjoy themselves,' says Christina, from Astoria, New York. 'Back in the States we just work and then some!' </p> <p>If the myth of Persephone is alive and kicking, the price of paradise has gone up in modern times. Instead of six months away from the 'underworld', you get two weeks of annual freedom and stockpile the rest for retirement. Perhaps those who stayed put view it all differently. Like M\u00edtsos, the ancient fisherman deafened in an encounter with a windmill blade; and B\u00e1rba Io\u00e1nnis, near-blind with cataracts, his Assos cigarette invariably missing the three ashtrays on his table. The tragedy of lost communication can be excruciating to behold when the deaf man forgets to remember to watch the lips of the blind man. </p> <p>Paradise or not, Skino\u00fassa is a strikingly beautiful island. It is also surprisingly lush. And, like a floating Noah's Ark, it bursts at the seams with outsized livestock. Away from the toil of subsistence farming, the island boasts 17 unspoilt and chiefly hidden beaches. Desert island life is both pleasurable and disarming : it was curious to return from an isolated beach to find my outgoing footprints still immaculate in the dirt-track. Perhaps the flip-side to this Crusoe-esque stuff is the islanders' fascination for the verb taxidevo - travel. Used for transport of all sorts, it refers more specifically to figurative modes of escape. Drink, music, love and nature are all 'taxis' ferrying passengers to otherworldly destinations. </p> <p>Which is, of course, the spirit of the Panagyri . Miraculously, Skino\u00fassans reinvent life on their tiny slab of existence, resorting to their exhilarating talent for music and dance and letting rip. Forget plate-smashing and think a different breed of bacchanalian abandon: whole crates of Amstel beer and ersatz champagne hurled to the ground with the sort of gusto that offers enough of a fleeting escape to be a holiday in itself. I wonder if this exuberant 'journeying' reflects the knowledge that the Virgin Mary is not the only one bound for the skies, for the Panagyri also marks summer's close. </p> <p>Shutters are snapped into place and the acrid camphor of mothballs mingles incongruously with the scent of wild thyme. Down at the port of Mers\u00edni, there are painful leave-takings as the Skopel\u00edtis - the provisions boat from N\u00e1xos - manoeuvres its way out of the natural harbour into the world beyond. The night is young, however, and I am getting ahead of myself. Kyrios Angelos would not approve. </p> <p> The old man looks up from his Bible and focuses on the spectacle of sated tourists at his niece's kafen\u00edo . Worked off her feet, Kyria Pothit\u00ed shrills and spins in the kitchen like a whirling dervish. Out on the terrace, her university-educated son enjoys the attention he's getting as a temporary waiter. Expertly, he knits his eyebrows together and flurries into irresistibly accented English. Named after his great uncle, he briefs natives and ox\u00e9ni (outsiders) about the Bar Piraktik\u00f3 where his brothers are preparing the way for us to party long beyond dawn. Getting there involves a trek across recently ploughed fields, but there are lifts to be caught and the views of Almir\u00f3s beach just below and K\u00e9ros over on the horizon will make it worth our while. Everyone is welcome at the festivities. </p> <p>Apart from two Parisian fashion designers, there are Italians and a sprinkling of Scandinavians, but no Germans and few English. An international currency of words and smoke wafts over from the crowd next door, at Melt\u00e9mi's fresh grill. </p> <p>Along the main thoroughfare, the ambience is hotting up on the balcony of Bar Margar\u00edta and stomachs are swelling at Panor\u00e1ma, a summer joint run by the primary school teacher and ex-president of the island. </p> <p>The church's blue dome is set in the heart of the island. Its circular stained glass windows are shot through with lingering shafts of sunlight and the courtyard is a riot of abstract Cycladic lines. Inside, there are rich frescoes and an unusual icon depicting the Virgin standing rather than seated. Tapers are lit and incense fills the air. The chanting of those freed from tourist duties provides a contrast to the light, skipping rhythms of Cycladic island music. </p> <p>The priest has made a special trip over from the (literally) cliff-hanging monastery on Amorg\u00f3s. He is part of Skino\u00fassa's history, in as far as today's inhabitants - all six clans of them - are descendants of the last wave of settlers sent over by the monastery in 1840. </p> <p>I meet a sound-recordist from an award-winning film documentary about Skino\u00fassa. He is back on the island for the first time in around 20 years and trying to absorb the changes in a place candied in his mind. He assures me that his experience was the real thing. </p> <p>He spins me tales of paraffin lamps and water drawn from the well down at Mers\u00edni, of grown men dancing with handkerchiefs and children learning to write with their fingers in the dust. He enthuses about musicians playing at dawn to wake the sleeping fishermen cradled in their boats and about a people who had never been to Athens or experienced the razor-blade of tourism. </p> <p>His chin grows long with regret and we head to the Piraktik\u00f3 to lift our spirits. It is a good move. Everyone is down on their knees, clapping and yelping encouragement to the solo-dancer in their midst. He is Man\u00f3lis, Angelos's younger brother, and he kicks his legs and shrieks and spins before brushing the ground skilfully and rebounding. He combines lightning dexterity with hovering poise and he punctuates his rhythms with such intricate counterpoint that even the sound-recordist approves. </p> <p>The onlookers keep offering him toasts or prop\u00f3sis , and Man\u00f3lis downs a throatful from each glass before flinging it away and continuing the dance. </p> <p>Ad\u00f3nis, cousin of Angelos and Man\u00f3lis, is supposedly keeping the tab at the bar, but the drink is flowing so freely and so generously that I cannot see the point. We have danced all night to the starlight and now the sun is rising, red and mystical, behind K\u00e9ros. </p> <p>We are expected for church at 10. We plunge into the early morning waters of Alm\u00edros, before heading up to the village and the day's festivities. We pass the farmers on their way to milk the goats and we hear the sound of firecrackers resonating from every corner of the island. </p> <p>Pothit\u00ed's terrace fills for the game of b\u00edlies , a version of skittles that uses nine wooden bricks. The aim is to topple the centre brick, worth 10 points, or else score a point for each brick hit. There are two teams and it takes until evening for one of them to reach a winning score. </p> <p>Then the sound-recordist entreats us, xenitem\u00e9ni , ox\u00e9ni and Skinoussans alike, to a viewing of his film. I am torn between watching it and glancing at the faces of the islanders watching themselves 20 years ago. Unfortunately, the priest's video player goes up in a puff of smoke halfway through our session. But I've seen enough to know that Kyrios Angelos looks as sharp now as he did then. Are these the benefits of his abstemious regime? He smiles and asks me whether there are windmills in London.</p> <p><strong>Fact file</strong></p> <p><strong>Flights </strong></p> <p>Allsun and Faraway Holidays offer connecting Olympic Airways flights Heathrow-Athens-N\u00e1xos from \u00a3243.80 return, inc taxes.

  "<p>Emily Watson is distracted. She's staring at the cover of the book on the table. The book is Vladimir Nabokov's The Luzhin Defence, now - it almost certainly says - a major film starring John Turturro and Emily Watson. </p> <p>Watson is on the cover, although you couldn't really tell: she's got her head turned away from the camera, towards Turturro. Both are soaked. 'Why did they choose this picture?' she's asking. 'That scene isn't even in the film. We got halfway through shooting it when the rain pump broke down, so it was all a disaster. We managed to realign the story so we didn't need it.' </p> <p>Meeting Watson is strange. Beforehand, everyone says she's very nice, and so she is. In most ways she seems like a very average 33-year-old Londoner, if one on the more grown-up end of the spectrum. In person, she's more elegant than you expect: tall and wearing a dark green top and pale green trousers that accentuate her height. </p> <p>But Watson isn't an average Camden Town resident, still less your average actress. She received best actress Oscar nominations for her first film, Breaking The Waves and also for Hilary And Jackie. And even that doesn't do her justice: Breaking The Waves was hardly Academy-fodder, being foreign, strange, brutal and sexual. The force of Watson's performance meant that the Academy was forced to pay attention. </p> <p>Her impact has been so powerful so fast that it is a surprise when you realise how few films she's done. She counts them on her fingers, suggests six before deciding on seven. In fact, it's eight. In her third film, she starred opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in Jim Sheridan's The Boxer. The fourth was the controversial Hilary And Jackie. And her fifth was Tim Robbins's Cradle Will Rock, followed by Angela's Ashes. All in four years. </p> <p>It's an unlikely tale. After an impeccably middle-class upbringing (father an architect, mother a teacher) in London, Watson went to Bristol University to do English. She wanted to act, but had trouble convincing people she could. Drama schools turned her down. Eventually The Drama Studio in west London took her and she graduated to the Royal Shakespeare Company. By the time she started acting professionally, she was already 25. </p> <p>One of the words she uses most is 'lucky' and you can see why. She was still unknown at 29 when Lars von Trier chose her to play the disturbed girl from the tiny Calvinist Scottish island who marries a foreign oil rig worker. Then again, at the time only film buffs knew who von Trier was. Breaking The Waves would change both their lives. 'It was just a very personal thing for me,' she says in her soft voice. 'I'd never made a film before. I didn't know it was an important film. But I think I was aware that it represented a very intense time of personal change for him [von Trier]. Because if you look at the change between Europa and Breaking The Waves, he's thrown the rule book out of the window, and his relationship with actors completely changed, from bodies that you put somewhere to really being in touch with his emotional state. And he was discovering that in Breaking The Waves, so it was special.' Most actresses aren't able to analyse the different stages of directors' careers. Watson is different. </p> <p>There is a chance that Breaking The Waves will turn out to be one of the key films in cinema history. Already its influence has been enormous. And the reactions to it have been repeated with von Trier's Dancer In The Dark. Watson is a fan, although she expresses it in a slightly disturbing way. 'For me, watching it was like having someone walk over my grave. I could tell what was going to happen. Little things. I loved it, I found it very raw.' </p> <p>In a way, it is easy to see why the drama schools passed on Watson. The reason she is so effective on screen is that she acts with her face. Sure, she is no slouch at accents, but the expression comes from the corners of her mouth, her vast eyes. She is mildly taken aback when I suggest that this might be why her film career blossomed in a way her stage career did not. But she considers the point. 'It's funny, you don't know that about your face until someone points a camera at it. The first time I saw Breaking The Waves was in Cannes, and each nostril was as big as a house. It was a real shocker: I wasn't wearing any make-up - and no clothes at times - and everything was very exposed. It's a weird thing.' </p> <p>'Exposed' is something she's willing to do: in Hilary And Jackie she took Jacqueline Du Pre, something of a secular saint, and showed her to be a complex, confused and sexual character. Having also played Angela McCourt, she is aware of the peril of playing real people. 'It is a huge responsibility. Unless you make something incredibly bland, you're going to upset somebody. It's tricky, and I felt a bit stung by the whole thing with Hilary And Jackie . I was quite taken aback by the reaction to that. The way the press were talking about it, as if it was salacious tittle-tattle. It just so wasn't.' </p> <p> The Luzhin (pronounced as in illusion, according to Nabokov himself ) Defence isn't a showpiece for her on the scale of Breaking The Waves or Hilary And Jackie. Not that she's not good in it: she is. But it's not that kind of part. The film is a well-appointed costume drama but is turned into something more interesting by Turturro's performance as a damaged chess genius. Watson found someone else playing a traumatised character an interesting expe rience. 'I did have more of an appreciation of how, when you're in the thick of it - you think that everybody understands what you are going through. They don't. You have to stay in that world, it is so easy to destroy it. During Breaking The Waves, I was on my own in a hotel room. I think I would have been impossible to live with. When you go home, you have to pretend to be the person you are at home.' </p> <p>There is no obvious biographical reason why Watson should be so adept at trauma. She seems happy in her life in Camden with her husband, actor/writer Jack Waters, with whom she is working on a screenplay. And the only strange thing about her childhood seems to be the way her parents took a certain kind of educated, middle-class approach to life to its extreme. 'I grew up without a television. It meant that I read lots of books and entertained myself. I missed things: There's a huge gap in my knowledge of popular culture basically, because of it. I occasionally still get embarrassed when someone says \"you know such-and-such...\" and you just think' - her voice goes very meek - \"nooo...\". </p> <p>Yet to be released here is Trixie, a comedy by eccentric American director Alan Rudolph. Watson, taking a turn far off her expected course, plays a malapropism-spouting private eye. On her co-star Nick Nolte, she says: 'He's... just completely nuts, in the nicest possible way. He doesn't care, he really, really doesn't care. He's done everything. He's completely unshockable.' </p> <p>At one point, we talk about the Pitt-Aniston wedding, how mad all that is. In one way, Emily Watson belongs to that world now. But unlike Brad or Jennifer she can pass through at will: after she has finished her last interview of the day, she can just fade into the crowds of people ambling through Soho, leaving the star behaviour for when she's on screen. </p> <p><strong>The changing faces of Emily Watson </strong></p> <p><strong>Angela's Ashes <br></strong> (Alan Parker, 2000)<br> Uneven and gloomy adaptation of Frank McCourt's massively successful memoir, but Watson does a fine job as Frank's long-suffering but not exactly saintly mother. </p> <p><strong>Hilary and Jackie<br></strong> (Anand Tucker, 1999)<br> Still controversial biopic of Jacqueline Du Pre, with Watson deftly showing all sides to Du Pre's complex character, including her fascinatingly bizarre affected accent, as well as her descent into illness. </p> <p><strong>Breaking the waves</strong><br> (Lars Von Trier, 1996)<br> Watson's astonishing debut as Bess, the troubled girl from a remote Scottish island who slides into madness. The film is either a work of genius or unwatchable, but Watson's performance is terrifyingly convincing.</p> <p>\u0095 The Luzhin Defence is showing at Edinburgh Film Festival (0131 623 8030) on 22 August and opens nationwide next month.</p>",
  "<b> Mark, mid-forties</b> <p>'I went into therapy telling myself it was because I had decided to train to become a psychoanalyst, and therapy is part of the training, but I knew that I had stuff of my own to deal with. At the bottom of my problem was the fact that I was adopted when I was a baby, and it had left me with a barely conscious sense of deep abandonment. My adoptive family was fine, but I grew up like a cuckoo in their nest. I liked different things: I was quite academic and they were a very non-academic family. To this day, I'm the only member of the family from any generation to go to university. </p> <p>'Growing up, I felt a low level of unhappiness all the time. To a large extent I cauterised my feelings, but I was always angry, and socially incompetent. If I'd met myself, I wouldn't have liked myself. I chose psychoanalysis, which is one of the most demanding - and expensive - therapies. I went for an hour a day, four days a week, for just over a year. I wasn't a good patient. I intellectualised the process. </p> <p>'It was only gradually that I relinquished control, and that's when the therapy began to really affect me. For the first time, I let myself not be strong and in control. It was a very big thing for me, very liberating. Sometimes I'd become incredibly emotional. I'd drive home from sessions weeping in the car. </p> <p>'My adoptive family were blue-collar workers, and my birth mother, whom I'd met a few years before, was an academic. I began to idealise her family. During analysis I met my mother again, and my analyst helped me to understand my real feelings about her as the person who had abandoned me, and to get a more adult distance from the family. It's easy to underestimate the damage done to children by their parents. </p> <p>'I've always been good at my job, but I've also always had a unique ability to piss people off at work. I could never work out exactly why, but I seemed to rub people up the wrong way. As a consequence, my career has usually been most successful when I've been self-employed. During analysis, a really good job came up and I applied for it. I got it, and not only that, I became a pivotal person at the office, the consiglieri . That had never happened to me before, and I don't think it would have done without therapy. </p> <p>'I'm certainly calmer, less angry and more open. But the biggest effect went beyond individual examples. The best way I can describe it is to say that it gave me a completely new language - the language of emotions. It taught me to understand my own feelings and motivations, but also how to understand other people's. I gave it up because the emotional and financial commitment became too demanding, but what I learned from it, emotionally and intellectually, has stayed with me. I experienced it as something profound that was also slightly ludicrous.' </p> <p><b> Jennifer, early thirties</b> </p> <p>'I went into therapy a few years ago, because I was suddenly stuck in my life and needed to get unstuck. I'd been through a period of secret cocaine-taking, which I had pulled myself out of, but the feelings that had caused it stayed with me. I hated my job in publishing, but I didn't know what else to do or how to do it, and my old, old issues with my father were still there. He'd always been a terrible bully while I was growing up. I made myself strong to stand up to him, but it also made me scared of vulnerability and commitment. </p> <p>'At the beginning, I loved therapy. There is real value in talking about yourself for a whole hour to someone who doesn't interrupt or get bored or tell you exactly why you're completely wrong and a pain in the arse. But I've always talked about myself with close friends, and I'm used to having a relationship - I tell them, they tell me. My therapist just listened. She didn't talk about herself, and I started to find that really annoying. It seemed contrived and unnatural. </p> <p>'The therapy did give me clarity, but there were elements of it I really didn't like. Reliving my vulnerability as a child was horrible - I felt I'd moved on from that and I didn't want to go back. And once we got past talking about how stuck I felt and getting on to possible solutions, I backed off. I just wasn't ready to make those big changes. </p> <p>'It served its purpose for me, but after three months I'd had enough. It's a good way to kick-start yourself, but I'm very suspicious of people who stay in therapy for ages. I'm inclined to introspection and analysis myself, but you can get too much up your own bum. It's very valuable for getting your thoughts and feelings straight, but it's not a substitute for experience. Things happen to us - we make mistakes, we mess up and hopefully that's what moves us on. I think some people try to short-cut that process in therapy.' </p> <p><b> Sarah, mid-thirties</b> </p> <p>'When I was 18 I was engaged and had my own mortgage - embracing adult responsibilities as soon as I could, even though I wasn't ready for them. I reacted by drinking huge amounts and behaving as destructively as I could. </p> <p>'I first tried therapy in my early twenties, and had a bad experience. I went to one of these \"healing centres\", and was put into group therapy. It was too full-on for me - very confrontational. There were all these people weeping and screaming and punching cushions, and I remember feeling very uncomfortable. There was one particularly drippy woman there who kept whingeing that nobody liked her or valued her. The therapist said it wasn't true. Then she made us all say in turn that we loved her. Well, I didn't love her, and everything about it felt fake to me. </p> <p>'That put me off for years, but I went back into therapy in my thirties because I felt as if my life was in real crisis. I'd been married, had a child and got divorced. Then I met my current boyfriend and fell madly in love. He had been a drug addict but was in recovery. </p> <p>'I got pregnant, and he had a serious relapse. He went off the rails at a point when I felt most vulnerable. I was so angry, and so desperate. I felt so bad I believed that I needed to be hospitalised. Instead, I saw a woman therapist who calmed me down and got me over the crisis. She was a gentle, warm, affirmative person. She helped me to see past the cloud of rage and panic to my real situation. She also helped me see that there was nothing I could do to change my boyfriend, and that I would have to set boundaries for what I would and wouldn't accept from him. </p> <p>'Thankfully, he did recover. I'll always be grateful to that therapist, but after the crisis was over, I felt I needed to move on to a different kind of practitioner. I found a wonderful man, who specialises in addiction issues. My boyfriend and I see him together, and it has helped us more than I can describe. I also discovered that I've got what the therapist calls an \"addictive portfolio\" - shopaholic, workaholic, foodie. </p> <p>'It's important to make the links. A huge part of it has been coming to terms with my own anger - something I've had since I was a child. Sometimes I'd be angry with my boyfriend or one of my children, and he'd make me see it was left over anger from other relationships and betrayals. A big part of therapy is just becoming conscious about your own emotional issues.'</p>",
  "The United Nations is set to launch an attack on the Government's record on race relations, after condemnation from more than 30 British human rights and ethnic minority groups. <p>The criticism is contained in a report submitted by the groups to the UN committee responsible for monitoring racism. It contains claims that the Government's policy on asylum-seekers 'gives comfort to racists' and has led to increased racial tension. </p> <p>It also criticises Ministers for failing to grapple with police hostility to the findings of the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. </p> <p>The UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination meets every three years and last reported on Britain as Labour came to power. Campaigners believe its findings will, therefore, provide a clear picture of race relations in Tony Blair's Britain. </p> <p>Officials from the Home Office and the Foreign Office will fly tomorrow to Geneva in an attempt to head off the criticism. They will claim that they have met most of the committee's recommendations from 1997. The civil rights and anti-racist groups will make presentations on asylum-seekers, deaths in custody and education. </p> <p>The report has been compiled by the civil rights group Liberty and the anti-racist 1990 Trust from submissions by groups that include the Refugee Council. </p> <p>Maxie Hayles, of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit, said he had failed to notice any significant change in police attitudes since the Macpherson report was published in February 1999. 'Although there have been some improvements in police policy, this is not getting down to the bully boys on the ground.' he said. </p> <p>The report contains a list of six major areas of concern: </p> <p> \u0095 The number of racist attacks have increased. </p> <p> \u0095 People from ethnic minorities are more likely to be stopped and searched. </p> <p> \u0095 Immigration and asylum policy has become a threat to good race relations. </p> <p> \u0095 New race relation legislation includes exemptions for immigration policy. </p> <p> \u0095 Certain ethnic minorities are more likely to be unemployed. </p> <p> \u0095 Little improvement in the representation of ethnic minorities in public life. </p> <p>It is hoped that the committee will demand public inquiries into the deaths in custody of Alton Manning and Roger Sylvester and the killing of Zahid Mubarak while he was at Feltham young offenders' institution. </p> <p>However, Brenda Weinberg, chair of the United Families and Friends Campaign, which works for the relatives of people who have died in custody, said she was sceptical that anything would come of government plans to set up a fully independent police complaints procedure. </p> <p>The Home Office told The Observer that it had presented its own submission to the discrimination committee (CERD) last May, but said officials would be providing the UN with an update when they arrive tomorrow. 'We are are confident we have fulfilled our reporting obligations to the UN,' a spokesman said. </p> <p>However, the organisations involved said that they had been given less than a week to respond to the Government's submission to CERD. Those which failed to do so were told that it would be assumed they were not interested.</p>",
  "A former priest standing to be a Labour MP will not be able to take his seat in Parliament because of archaic laws lost in the mists of England's anti-Catholic past. <p>David Cairns, Labour candidate for the safe seat of Greenock and Inverclyde in the west of Scotland, will be barred from sitting in the House of Commons, even though he left the Catholic priesthood six years ago. </p> <p>Cairns is seeking to get the law, thought to originate in the 1600s when anti-Catholic feeling in Britain ran high, overturned. It would be embarrassing for a proudly modernising Government if the issue turned into a constitutional row after the next election. </p> <p>'The law must be changed,' Cairns said. 'I am allowed to get selected, to stand for Parliament, to win the election but not to take my seat.' </p> <p>Only once before has the issue threatened to become a public battle. Bruce Kent, the former leader of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a onetime priest, stood for election in 1992. But he failed to win his seat and the law went unchallenged. </p> <p>Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh is leading the amendment campaign. The intention is to have a clause inserted into an election Bill to be considered by the House of Lords which would allow ex-priests into Parliament. </p> <p>McDonagh tried to have the law changed last year, but failed to win enough support from the Government. </p> <p>'If people are properly selected by their party and win a valid mandate from the voters, it is simply undemocratic that our ancient law can prevent those elected members from taking their place in the House,' Mc Donagh told Parliament at the time. </p> <p>The ban on former priests is based on nine Acts of Parliament from the 16th and 17th centuries. It does not apply to the Church of England clergy or other faiths such as Judaism or Islam. </p> <p>In a memorandum to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, Robert Blackburn, a professor of constitutional law, said: 'The reasons for the discriminatory principles... have no justification today.' </p> <p>Cairns, who works in McDonagh's office in Westminster, became a priest in 1991, at St Mary's Catholic Church in Clapham, south London. He said working with disadvantaged groups gave him a political appetite and he left the priesthood in 1994.</p>",
  "<p>The Bang has a spring in it. It builds to an echoing climax and then is thrown up into the air. Whoosh, Ka-bang, bo-ing. Then, as the sound lands, a resounding thump. For two teenage boys this is a good noise, a sound rich with all the corollaries of pleasure. For the two adults weeding over the wall it is almost torture, almost an invasion, almost bloody intolerable. But not quite. It shatters the peace that the garden so carefully laces around itself and is an assault of a kind - but one thing saves it. After each elastic, clattering crash is a whoop of laughter. That raucous, pubescent addition to the general row clears and legitimises everything else. Adam and Josh are having fun. </p> <p>I got a nice letter today from a reader of this column asking me to drop by and see the letter-writer's garden, asking me to bring the children, too 'as it is a great place for playing hide and seek'. While it is a charming image (and invitation) it presupposes that my children are locked between the ages of about four and eight. The truth is that gardens are dangerous places for unsupervised toddlers and dead boring for any child over seven. Popular garden lore can accommodate toddlers and young children, and there are a number of books that explore all the delightful ways that small children can enjoy your garden. However, there is always a subtext to these books - children enjoying the garden without trashing it too badly. But trashing things is inevitable, if you are having the right kind of fun. Football and cricket ruin lawns, flowerbeds and greenhouses. (This summer Adam hit a cricket ball through the open door of the greenhouse; it bounced once on the path, miraculously went through an open window and out the other side - straight on to a pile of spare panes resting against the fence. Six sheets of glass, smashed.)</p> <p>Treehouses are most fun with six-inch nails, scaffolding planks, rope and plenty of branches sawn off to fit them in and get a good view. Bicycles make good muddy ruts in paths and, anyway, seem to spend most of their lives thrown down on the ground blocking a doorway.</p> <p>My children are all heavily into blading (or is it skates - the wrong terminology in front of their friends is met with eye-rolling contempt). Hence the half-pipe, which consists of three pieces of 8ft by 4ft marine ply coaxed into curves to make an enormous ramped semicircle so they can swoop down one side, up the other, jump and twist in mid-air and either whizz back down again or fall tumbling on to their backsides. It is brilliant and took the two boys a whole afternoon to make. A variety of tools were used, and the principal ingredient, other than the ply, assorted blocks of wood, concrete blocks, four milk crates, all my nails and a mysterious quantity of rope, is the courtyard garden. This is a minimalist area, refined to an exquisite harmony in stone and wood, the yard paved in York stone, the walls of ancient red sandstone and a square of river-washed pebbles in the centre. Around the perimeter are nine cubes of green oak, now weathering into a silvery-cracked maturity. It is the children's best bit of the garden at the moment, because it is brilliant for blading. Unfortunately, the half-pipe means blocking the only entrance to the walled garden, which is where we eat whenever we can in summer.</p> <p>The walled garden was completely revamped last year for the children. They wanted a lawn near the house. Sarah and I wanted a hard surface near the house. There was a huge open space down the end of the garden, but children like to be near. They like popping in and out. They like the garden as an extension of their bedrooms, and after a day at home the two look pretty similar. So we cleared the four big borders, moving them to the perimeter, and made a lawn in the centre. The trampoline sits in the middle of that patch of grass.</p> <p>Trampolines are just another piece of the affluent family's kit nowadays. Boasting about having a trampoline is dead uncool, and I'm the only one in our household who does it. But the children use it all the time. From the landing window, I can watch my lovely daughter Freya, 12, leaping and flying, headphones on, crazy auburn corkscrew hair shooting out, eyes closed as she dances to the rhythm of her CD Walkman. Actually it is mine and was a birthday present, but she has nabbed it. Nine-year-old Tom goes and jumps when he is angry, and it soothes him. Adam and his friends, Josh and George, all 14, fight and laugh and swear in that hoarse, shouty way 14-year-olds do, like boisterous, awkward cubs. The funny thing is that Sarah and I ignore the trampoline - which totally dominates the space - in the same way that they ignore the subtleties of the planting - all pastels and whites - around their leaping selves. We accommodate each other's needs by pretending that they are temporary.</p> <p>And, of course, on every level, they are. The children grow as fast as the garden, and they change their demands from the garden almost daily. Certainly by the time you have established any kind of set-up for them, they have moved on to something else. What children beyond the hide-and-seek age want is a kind of loosely equipped playground with enough familiarity so that they can loaf comfortably, but with enough novelty to make the world up afresh as the spirit takes them.</p> <p>Horticulture doesn't come into it. My daughter made a garden this year and did it carefully and well. But once made - which took her perhaps three sessions of an hour spread over a week - it was forgotten. Everything was in the doing of it. In fact, it has thrived and her sweet peas are every bit as good as ours, despite total neglect. Tom periodically makes camps and treehouses but his are all essentially hiding places. One was elaborately dug out and then camouflaged to look like a stack of brashings (sweet that he does not think I know every stick and leaf of this garden) and he has a series of flowerpots sunk in the ground, covered over with a tile and then hidden by soil. They each contain an emblematic piece of him, like a key or a sweet. He roams this garden like a member of the Resistance, seemingly compliant to its strict regulations and adult, horticultural tyranny, but really possessing it as fully as anyone.</p> <p>And there is his shed. This is strictly private and entrance is by invitation only. There are a series of notices to that effect, the latest of which reads: 'BUGER OF, I LIVE HEAR' - he's not so hot on spelling, our Tom, but he has other skills. His shed is a serious workshop and much more highly sophisticated than anything I possess or am able to employ.</p> <p>At the age of nine, he can make almost anything that he sets his mind to, copying things seen on television or in magazines, or making up inventions. He makes things all day. Nothing is more admirable. Yet his mess spreads like a dervish workshop ripple from his shed to the farthest reaches of the garden, with saws, power drills, hammers, endless bits of wood, plastic, metal and string put down and abandoned wherever the fancy has taken him. And he bangs an awful lot. Boys in the garden always equal noise. Tom seems to foray out from his shed with the tools of the moment and to work wherever the action is. This is not just limited to the garden but has now ventured quietly out into cyberspace. I got a bill the other day for a domain name registered as www.tomshed.com that he had set up entirely on his own. I think perhaps that tomshed.com is the most accurate metaphor for a growing child's garden - a mental space of limitless imagination founded on the comfort of an actual, utterly safe haven.</p> <p>Inevitably, the real garden with a growing family of children will be untidy, messy even, noisy and often destructive. It drives arch control-freaks like myself mad. But I hate it when they are not there. </p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>All change. All the broad beans and peas are up and on the compost heap, and purple kale, red cabbage, purple sprouts and purple-sprouting broccoli have replaced them. You may notice a theme. The idea is that the winter is fundamentally a brown and grey place here, and while green is good and to be encouraged, purple is better. It also seems to make the green greener while diminishing the brown. So the greener brassicas - calabrese, savoys, cavolo nero - have all been planted out up the top end of the garden where the garlic was. </p> <p>Garlic is good for the soil and most things thrive that follow it on a piece of ground, so this is hardly relegation for the green greens. I did not dig the ground after the garlic was lifted, but simply raked it over and trowelled a hole for each plant, which had been grown in a 3in pot, so that it is a fair-sized plant before the slugs can get at it. I don't believe in no-dig gardening, except as a labour-saving scheme, but brassicas like firm soil so that their roots anchor strongly. It will be interesting to see if this laissez-faire method makes them able to withstand wind better than their purple counterparts in the more pampered vegetable garden. </p> <p>The garlic is a fabulous crop this year. I sowed 'Cledar' in November and 'Printnor' a month later on heavy ground lightened only with mushroom compost. While I do not think of this soil or climate as being good for garlic, I know that it is perfect for parsley and have never failed to have masses of flat-leaf all year round. This year, for a reason I have not yet established, all three sowings of parsley are looking poorly, with orange, feeble leaves and weak root-growth. Although it has been rather dry, I think the cause of this might be a fungal infection. </p> <p>Talking of dry, everything could do with a good soak. We do not water much because we do not have the time or irrigation system, but I always know what things are beginning to suffer when the Acanthus spinosus starts to flop dangerously. But the plant that suffers the most from dry weather is the Gunnera manicata that I planted last spring. I lined its (large) planting hole with an old butyl liner, and added masses of compost to hold moisture, but it only gets wet when the garden floods or when I leave the hose on it. However, it has amazing powers of recovery after a long bath.</p>",
  "<p>'It isn't about filling a bucket; it's about lighting a fire!' So goes the advice given to undergraduate students choosing their subjects at Miami University, Ohio. </p> <p>The advice given to students selecting a degree course on this side of the Atlantic may be less colourful, but it still carries the same message. Universities, careers advisers and employers agree that students should choose a subject they enjoy. </p> <p>Students should ignore advice to go for a subject that promises a job in a sexy part of the economy, such as IT, or one thought to involve watching lots of daytime TV, such as media studies. </p> <p>At the very least studying a subject you find boring is unlikely to lead to academic glory. At most it could mean subjecting yourself to three years of misery. </p> <p>Keith Hicks, communications manager for the University of the West of England, says the university has found it vital for students to study a subject that matches their ambitions. He says that students who who do not are much more likely to drop out. </p> <p>To address this problem the University set up a programme in collaboration with Ucas to produce a profile of individual courses to help students choose. </p> <p>This 'course profile' gives students details about jobs former graduates of the course are doing and the skills the course will require of an individual student. It is meant to be a kind of course CV. Hicks says: 'Those studying more vocational courses such as education, computer studies or media studies tend to be more typecast in the kinds of jobs which they go on to after graduation.' They should therefore be very sure about their ultimate career ambitions. 'Non-vocational courses are better for people wanting to keep their options open.' </p> <p>Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, represents employers who recruit between 20 and 30 thousand graduates each year across all sectors of the economy. In his view it is necessary to look much further than the choice of subject when considering how best to secure a graduate job. He says: 'It's not enough just to go to university and end up with a degree'. Students, he says, 'need to take control of their career and take advantage of opportunities to develop new skills.' </p> <p>Employers are looking for difficult-to-define skills such as the ability to work with colleagues, to express yourself clearly - and the self confidence to follow a job through to completion. Gilleard says that while at university, students should take part-time or voluntary work to build their self-confidence and demonstrate their abilities to future employers. </p> <p>Anne Lindsey, from the Learning and Skills Group of employers' organisation The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), says: 'Students should go to university knowing what they want to get out of their time in terms of personal development and improving their employability.' She believes that employers look for, 'intellectual, communication, interpersonal and specialist knowledge'. All the other skills can be gained from academic study of any subject and, importantly, from experiences beyond the curriculum. </p> <p>Lindsey says students must nowadays, 'think early about how to improve employability and take advantage of the careers services at their university early on in their course'. Already, according to a study by the Department for Education and Employment, 41 per cent of all students now do some form of work experience during their degree. </p> <p>Work experience is often a part of the curriculum in vocational degrees, through 'sandwich courses', where students work for a time in industry during their studies. </p> <p>However the view of the CBI is that all students need to be getting work experience. Even those students studying non-vocational subjects such as English should be looking to improve their mix of skills through extra-curricular activities during their time at university. </p> <p>The requirements of employers are greater than ever, and a student can't meet them any longer simply by doing well in their degree. Many graduates, those who did media courses for example, have already found that there are a very limited number of jobs being chased by a large number of graduates. </p> <p>Graduates from non-vocational courses are competing with them for the same jobs. In the media, as in many other areas, getting the perfect job on graduation depends on a lot more than getting on to the right course. </p> <p>The growth in the number of vocational degrees and places available on these courses has continued throughout the Nineties, and shows no sign of ending. </p> <p>There are now more places available to study business as an undergraduate (41,000) does than there are to study physical or biological science (37,000). </p> <p>This growth is partly driven by the appetite of business for more and more graduates qualified in booming sectors such as IT and electrical engineering. It is also a response to the demand from students for new kinds of courses. </p> <p>Among many students there is a misconception that vocational courses offer the best employment opportunities after graduation. However when applying for the majority of graduate jobs the degree subject is irrelevant. What is important to an employer is simply that the candidate has a degree, which demonstrates their sound intellect. </p> <p>Unwelcome as it may sound to those who believe their place on a media studies, or other vocational course, will guarantee them a job, there are plenty of hurdles to clear before the first pay cheque. </p> <p>Conversely, for those who fancied a media studies course and have ended up in clearing, expecting to study English or other traditional courses, the chance of getting that dream job may be better than you thought. </p> <p>The writer of this article studied politics at university, qualified as a lawyer and decided to become a journalist only after working for several years. I dread to think of all the vocational knowledge, which poured into my brain never to be seen again. My advice is not to worry. </p> <p>Remember everyone's fire gets lit eventually. Take your time and work out what it is you really want to do, and then get going.</p>",
  "<p>This is a tense time for students who have just taken their A Levels (or equivalents) - and, indeed, for their parents. Those who have conditional offers for university or other higher education courses know what grades they have to make. Depending on those results, different career paths and lifetime opportunities would appear to open up - or, if the grades aren't good enough, be closed down. </p> <p> But will going to university increase your future earning capacity? Given the considerable financial costs of going through three or more years of higher education, it is well worth looking beyond the immediate hurdle to see whether there are other ways to get what you want out of life and to glean some idea of what you might be earning four or five years out. </p> <p> A survey conducted by the economics department at the University of Warwick looked at the earnings of nearly 45,000 students who graduated in 1993 from traditional universities (not former polytechnics) and went more or less straight into employment. After six months, average earnings for men were \u00a3464 a week, while the average for women graduates was considerably lower, at \u00a3347 a week. This was in line with most earlier research, which showed male graduates earning salaries 17 per cent higher than those of men who did not attend university or did not complete their degrees. The differential for women was even more pronounced, with a 37 per cent premium over non-graduates. </p> <p>But that data goes back to 1993 - before the internet and the 'New Economy' took off. Nor does it include graduates from any of the 'modern' universities. Taking a longer viewpoint, the differential between graduates and non-graduates tends to increase with age. All the research confirms that university graduates do earn more in the long run. Richard Pearson, director of the Brighton-based Institute of Employment Studies (IES), uses a 'rate of return analysis' to show that, on average, graduates earn 60 per cent more over a working life. </p> <p> 'But that,' he notes, 'is historical data based on final salaries before retirement. It's looking back into the twentieth century, not forward to the twentyfirst.' What the Warwick research does underline is that it makes a big difference what kind of degree you get. A first-class degree holder will earn about 12 per cent more than a person who gets a third. It also found considerable differences between subjects studied. At the older universities, law and politics students found jobs paying roughly 20 per cent above average, while those studying the humanities or agriculture were paid well below the median salary. </p> <p> But again, these results are achieved by analysing historical data and extrapolating forward. They are also based on the graduates' first jobs. Those taking time out are not represented, while those who took a temporary and fairly low-paid job before deciding on their career may depress the averages. </p> <p> Yet another approach was applied in a recent study conducted by the Higher Education Career Services Unit (CSU), using data from the Labour Force Survey to see how graduate earnings compared with those of non-graduates. Based on a random sample of British households conducted in 1998, the research shows that, on average, graduates earn over 60 per cent more than non-graduates. The pay gap among the 20-24 age group was 31 per cent; by the late thirties it was 60 per cent; and graduates in their late forties were earning 76 per cent more. It also found that the earnings gap between female graduates and non-graduates was consistently higher than for males. </p> <p> So most significant consideration for those thinking of taking a university degree is not the salary level of their first job after graduating, but what happens thereafter. For their earnings rise much more sharply as their career 'takes off' between the ages of 25 and 35. Above the age of 40 average earnings level out or even drop off - maybe because the older respondents were working fewer hours or taking on different roles. But the graduates tend to 'plateau' at a much higher level and retain their peak earnings later in life. </p> <p> Another CSU report, entitled 'Moving On' tracked the early career paths of people who graduated in 1995, including those from the new universities. Again, the choice of subject was critical, with those qualifying in medicine, maths and computing, engineering and business studies earning more than \u00a320,000, while those who had studied arts or humanities earned on average \u00a317,000 or less. The demand for good graduates has been booming in recent years. The demand is most fierce at the 'high-flyer' end of the spectrum, with big recruiters such as multi-nationals, the City and financial services companies still unable to find what they need. At the IES, Richard Pearson notes: 'Despite their recurrent difficulties, the major recruiters have not markedly raised graduate starting salaries. While last year a few paid in excess of \u00a325,000, many jobs are advertised at \u00a310-12,000. Changes to the median starting salary (\u00a317,500 in 1999) largely track the rise in national earnings'. For those who are certain to get into the university and course of their choice, the answer as to whether it's worth it is straightforward. On average graduates do earn more, and continue to do so throughout their working lives. </p> <p> But that is on average. Different individuals have different skills and aptitudes. The decision is most difficult for those who haven't got on to the course they wanted, or who are unsure whether they'll graduate. The experience of going to university may be worthwhile in itself, but the financial bonuses normally kick in only if you get the qualification. </p> <p> The UK has one of the lowest student drop-out rates in the world. In 1995-6 only 18 per cent did not complete their higher education course; this compares with 28 per cent in Germany, 37 per cent in the US and 66 per cent in Italy. And as for the likelihood of being in a job three years after graduation, 94 per cent of British students manage that, as against 86 per cent of French graduates and 68 per cent in Italy. </p> <p> Work out what the total cost of your degree will be, factor in all the variables, such as dropping out or not finding a job, and then make an estimate of what your lifetime earnings might be. The result would be a basic risk/reward ratio. But the law of averages will always work out that it is worth taking that risk and making the personal investment of taking that university place.</p>",
  "<p>Madonna really doesn't go for the boy-next-door type. Anyone who remembers her encounter with Kevin Costner in the documentary In Bed with Madonna knows this. </p> <p>Costner's first mistake that evening was wearing a blouson, a satin baseball jacket, for his audience in her dressing room, but he then compounded the error by choosing to describe Madonna's stage show as 'neat'. Such preppy language went down very badly indeed. </p> <p>It is a fair guess then that Guy Ritchie did not become consort to one of the most famous women on the planet by adopting a friendly, New Man approach. Being cool is important to Madonna and Ritchie's carefully-maintained 'diamond hard' persona fits the brief. </p> <p>This weekend Ritchie, 31, is celebrating the first of two important life events slated for late summer 2000. He has a new baby boy; a first child for him and born to Madonna on Friday night. The couple have decided to call the him Rocco, a name which has the requisite Italian associations but certainly also resonates with Ritchie's strong interest in organised crime. Considering there was speculation that the film director might plump for the names of Ronnie or Reggie, Rocco perhaps represents a compromise. </p> <p>And in 10 days' time Ritchie faces the second big diary date of the year. His new feature film, Snatch, is premiered on 23 August amid much hype. Three years ago his first full length feature, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, was hailed as a modern British classic. A lively and flash tale set in London's gangland, it resulted in a copycat outbreak of criminal proportions. </p> <p>The success of his first movie in America has put Ritchie in the same boat as Sam Mendes, the other one-film-wonder-boy of British cinema, although the career paths of the two could not be further apart. While Mendes went to Cambridge and then made his name in the theatre, Ritchie had no academic success and is known to dislike the 'stagey' style of theatre actors. </p> <p>Snatch is another gangland story, but this time it is largely set in Hatton Garden and stars a very big name. Brad Pitt. The Hollywood star is rumoured to have cut his normal fee by 90 percent to take the part of a gypsy boxer who, incidentally, is almost entirely incoherent throughout. </p> <p>The film, naturally, had a much bigger budget than Lock, Stock and so this time Ritchie did not come up against the same obstacles. Back then, as the film was starting to win critical praise, Ritchie was angry. </p> <p>'We made our film without a distributor,' he said, 'and in Britain that is a big problem. The distributors here are the wrong people to be deciding what should get a theatrical release. We kept getting these fantastic results from audiences off the street, but when we showed the film to 10 British distributors, we didn't get a laugh or a snigger from any of them.' </p> <p>He and his producer, the even younger Matthew Vaughn, were considering recasting the whole story, when a new set of investors stepped in and Polygram took up the cause. The success of the \u00a31 million film saw the birth of 'geezer chic', with the footballer-turned-actor, Vinnie Jones, in the unlikely role of mid-wife. It made \u00a350m at the world box office and \u00a311m in Britain. </p> <p>Nowadays, because of his relationship with the woman he calls Madge, Ritchie is encased in the glass box of ultra celebrity. But he still gets angry. </p> <p>He is irritated, for a start, by the way the press have attacked him for having an affluent background and a cockney, or 'mockney', accent. Too many jokes about his 'manor' having a gravel drive and a swimming pool have made him cross. 'I never said I lived in the East End for 30 years,' he complains. </p> <p>It is certainly true he has a penchant for slightly retro London vocabulary. He refers to Madonna in conversation as 'the missus' and uses the quaint expletive 'bleeding' in apparent homage to characters once played by Michael Caine or Bob Hoskins. </p> <p>When film journalists first met Ritchie, before he had the protective veneer of fame, they thought him 'scampish' and 'fidgety', yet undeniably 'streetwise'. He is tall, with dark brown eyes set quite far apart, and has something of the reluctant gay icon about him - from the gold sovereign ring on his finger, to his tousled blond hair. </p> <p>There is an old Stanley Knife scar down one cheek too, that is testament to a violent streak. A year ago he fought Madonna's ex-boyfriend, Andy Bird, in the exclusive Met Bar, and reputedly floored Nick Moran, the star of Lock, Stock, in another fight. This spring he was held briefly by the police after beating up one of the male fans who waits outside Madonna's London home. </p> <p>Ritchie's un-PC verbals have also brought him grief. He was recently quoted saying how hard it is to find convincing black actors, and later reported that he wouldn't let Madonna dress him like a 'poof'. </p> <p>In fact, their relationship appears to be predicated on his being a man's man. He makes her do the shopping and he won't let her drive in this country because she is used to driving on the other side of the road. </p> <p>Ritchie was born in Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 1968. His mother, Amber, was a model and his father, John, made television commercials, including the well-known Hamlet cigar campaign. The family lived in Fulham, west London, where Ritchie's sister, Tabitha, now runs a dance centre. Their parents divorced when he was five. </p> <p>Ritchie then went to live with his mother's new husband, Sir Michael Leighton, in his family pile, Loton Park, Shropshire, until she divorced again when he was 12. Due to his severe dyslexia, Ritchie had trouble at school - he eventually attended 10 in total. </p> <p>Armed with one GCSE in film studies, he found himself a job at Island Records and indulged his taste for drugs in 'reggae days of haze'. During this time he admits he hung out with villains, but says he did not become one. 'If you haven't lived, you're nicking ideas from other people's films,' he explains. </p> <p>After a moment of epiphany on his 25th birthday Ritchie went into film, first becoming a runner and then making music videos. His first short film, The Hard Case, was a rough draft of the Lock, Stock story and Ritchie's real break did not come until he showed the longer screenplay to Vaughn, the 27-year-old estranged son of the actor Robert Vaughn, </p> <p>Then, of course, came the big meeting with the woman he was soon to dub a 'top bird'. Sting's wife, Trudie Styler, introduced him to Madonna at a party and the singer was enchanted by the cheeky hopeful who was 10 years her junior. She offered to bring out the soundtrack of Lock, Stock in the States. </p> <p>Today, as Ritchie cradles baby Rocco, he knows the world is waiting to judge the next film. He started the script before Lock, Stock became a hit and in theory it is a darker film. In the current issue of the listings magazine Time Out , which Ritchie guest edits, he sets out a fresh role for himself as a champion of the outsider. He loves gypsies, he writes, because they are so 'visceral'. </p> <p>But Ritchie is a bit more than a privileged, anti-intellectual lad. He has a latent thirst for learning and spends part of each day being instructed by tutors in a wide range of subjects. Despite his dyslexia, he reads voraciously, underlining the bits he wants to commit to memory. </p> <p>With that kind of determination and grit there is actually no need for dropping aitches or aping crooks. </p> <p><strong> Guy Ritchie</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> Hatfield, Hertforshire, 1968 </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> Stanbridge Earls School, Winchester (\u00a315,000 a year), among others </p> <p><strong> Qualifications:</strong> One GCSE (film studies) </p> <p><strong> Lives with: </strong> Madonna </p> <p><strong> Claim to fame:</strong> Father of Madonna's son (Rocco); wrote and directed Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch (to be released on 1 September; American title, Snatch'd )</p>",
  "<p>Forty years ago Kenneth Tynan conducted a lengthy interview for The Observer with Jean-Paul Sartre, during which he asked if right-wing art was possible. Unfortunately, instead of saying la droite (the political Right), he said le droit (the law). Before he could correct himself, Sartre had taken off on an unstoppable spiel, beginning with the assertion that 'the law is theatre' and going on to show that 'the characters of Sophocles, of Euripides, even of Aeschylus - they are all lawyers' and that 'the stage is the courtroom'. </p> <p>When Tynan returned to the matter in hand, asking Sartre if 'an author of extreme right-wing views could ever succeed in creating a work of art', he received a plain answer 'in my opinion, no'. According to Sartre, as the Right no longer understood how the world functions 'one can't imagine a modern play that could be at the same time right-wing and good'. </p> <p>I thought of this exchange while watching William Friedkin's Rules of Engagement because as a courtroom drama it fulfils in the most literal way Sartre's definition of what constitutes theatre and also because it's arguably right-wing and unarguably pretty bad, though not without entertaining moments, mostly connected with the central performances. </p> <p>There have always been two streams of Hollywood movies about the armed forces - those made with the assistance of the army, navy or air force, which have constituted the majority, and those which have not sought, or have been denied, official assistance.</p> <p>Rules of Engagement belongs very clearly in the former category, as a somewhat extreme apologia for military conduct and thinking. It begins in the swamps of Vietnam in 1968 where a young black lieutenant, Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), saves the life of a fellow officer, Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), by committing a war crime. To compel a North Vietnamese colonel to call off his men bent on killing Hodges's isolated section, Childers murders a Vietcong prisoner-of-war in cold blood. This is what happens in battle, the film implies, and only a civilian would think it improper. </p> <p>The film cuts to 29 years later when both men are US marine colonels, one divorced, the other married to the corps. Hodges, a military lawyer of no great distinction (he's been behind a desk since being crippled in Nam), is on the point of retirement; Childers is on active service in the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>When a mob of Islamic fundamentalists threatens the American embassy in Yemen, Childers takes a platoon of Marines to the rescue, saving the ambassador and his family, but ordering his men to fire on the mob, whom he sees as an armed threat to his men, and 83 civilians are killed and more than 100 wounded. As a result he returns home not to a hero's welcome, but to a court martial with the possibility of receiving a death sentence. Improbably, he asks his old chum Hodges to defend him, rather than engaging a hot-shot civilian. </p> <p>Credit for the story goes to the film's executive producer, James Webb, who served as a marine officer in Vietnam before working as a lawyer, writer on military affairs and US Secretary of the Navy under Reagan. The screenplay, however, is by a television writer, Stephen Gaghan, and it is presumably he who has larded it with every clich\u00e9 in the book from the retired lawyer out fly-fishing when he's called back to the fray to the ridiculous bonding fight between old chums that ends in black eyes, bloody noses and laughter. </p> <p>There are the usual surprise witnesses, of course, as well as vital bits of evidence that suddenly turn up, though these are all acceptable aspects of the courtroom genre. More significantly, however, the audience is given nothing to ponder, evaluate, think about. We should be in the position of the seven marine majors who make up the jury. Instead, we're made privy to vital information that would not merely have been useful for the defence but would have prevented Childers from being indicted in the first place. </p> <p>The villains of the piece (worse than the Yemeni mob whom the movie views as so many towelheads) are a suave National Security Adviser (Bruce Greenwood), with a portrait of Jack Kennedy, on his wall and a cowardly US ambassador (Ben Kingsley), with a throbbing vein in his temple. </p> <p>But we aren't invited to assess their credibility as witnesses. We've already seen the ambassador act in a craven fashion in Yemen so we know he's a gross perjurer when he accuses Childers of losing his cool and enforcing the evacuation. </p> <p>We also see the Security Adviser, who's looking for a scapegoat to appease Middle- Eastern opinion, destroy a video from the embassy's CCTV surveillance camera that shows (rather unlikely this) that every man, woman and child in the mob had a concealed automatic weapon and fired on the Marines. This pair are contrasted with a newly discovered good guy, the Vietnamese colonel Childers had captured in the jungle 30 years earlier, and who now salutes his old adversary. </p> <p>Seeing this movie after the Republican Convention in Philadelphia is an unnerving experience. The presidential candidate avoided serving in Vietnam and his vice-presidential running mate had 'more pressing business' than doing his national service. Yet the party called in Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf and General Colin Powell to rouse the delegates. Do the producers of Rules of Engagement really believe that the American public is still hostile to the armed forces, and if so do they think that simplistic gung-ho movies that back the boys in uniform right or wrong are the way to restore confidence in the military? </p> <p>Another question about the film is raised by the final name on the cast list - talk show host - G. Gordon Liddy. What was the most right-wing member of the Watergate plumbers doing in this movie and why was he cut from the print being shown in Britain?</p>",
  "<p>In an address given to an aptly awful audience of venture capitalists a few months ago, Tony Blair adopted the modish confessional style and told the world that his struggle to manage the public sector had left 'scars on my back'. The National Health Service was not a home for the many under-resourced and over-worked people who run the most efficient medical service in the developed world, but a swamp of vested interests. Nurses, doctors and cleaners were the \u00e9lite forces of conservatism. The Prime Minister was their proletarian victim. Only the unreliable protection of an enormous Parliamentary majority and a Cabinet which will let him do anything he wants, prevented a martyrdom to rival Saint Di's. </p> <p>After his performance, no one had the right to be surprised when he announced that henceforth the NHS would buy operations from private hospitals. A 'concordat' had been reached with corporate medicine. 'I have always made clear that it is not a question of ideology,' he said in July when asked if further treaties were likely. </p> <p>Admittedly, this particular policy without ideology was the wheeze of New Labour's most influential think tank - the Conservative Party, which once was considered to be an ideologically motivated organisation. But all Third Wayers of good will and sound judgment could be relied upon to forget intellectual origins in this instance and agree that it is nothing more than plain common sense to cut waiting lists by snapping up private services. Who wouldn't prefer to be treated on demand by suddenly deferential consultants in a room of one's own, luxuriously appointed with pot plants the size of triffids, soft carpets and cable television? How many Observer readers have forgotten their loud defences of the NHS when worrying pains afflict them or their loved ones and gone private? What matters is what works. Only a weirdo and probable paedophile would sacrifice the health of a child on the alter of an exhausted ideology. The private sector delivers. </p> <p>It can deliver your child at the Portland Hospital, where Sarah Ferguson, Patsy Kensit, and Posh Spice were relieved of various sprogs. Those with other requirements can be sent to the Harley Street, Princess Grace or Wellington hospitals in central London. All four were brought by a company called HCA on 19 May. The US health conglomerate, which used to be called Columbia/HCA, but was forced to dance the old Windscale-Sellafield name shuffle for reasons we'll get to in a moment, added the Devonshire, Lister and London Bridge hospitals to its portfolio in June. The company intends to nab 'new facilities in markets outside the London area' as soon as possible. </p> <p>Commercial rivals at the London Heart Hospital are so worried by the Americans' predatory intent they are trying to excite a media campaign to persuade the Department of Trade and Industry to stop HCA creating a private monopoly in London. Sir Richard Needham, a former Conservative Health Minister who now runs the Heart, complained to me at length that HCA's associates, the PPP insurance company, had insisted their patients - sorry, customers - should be diverted from his beds to the rooms of HCA hospitals. Needham's colleagues say the loss of income may force him to sell to the Americans. </p> <p>You may not care about Needham's problems - I won't pretend to have been sobbing myself - when HCA seems the better product. The company's PRs boast it is 'one of London's leading healthcare providers... committed to excellence and quality through the provision of specialised healthcare services. We have established an international reputation for offering the highest quality of service in private healthcare'. </p> <p>They forgot to add that HCA's international reputation is somewhat tarnished. On 19 May it agreed to pay $745 million (\u00a3500m) to the US Justice Department for the greatest fraud in American medical history, without admitting liability, after two executives had been jailed. When other alleged scams are resolved the final fine will be about a billion dollars. </p> <p>By purchasing private beds for public patients, New Labour is imitating American health care. The US government uses the Medicare and Medicaid national insurance schemes to pay 'independent' hospitals to treat working-class and elderly Americans. (The poor are left to suffer and die without health cover.) Charitable institutions with a rudimentary grasp of medical ethics are being taken over by medical conglomerates which seek to maximise profits. The US authorities cannot have officials on the spot to check that treatment is necessary and bills are accurate - if they did, they might as well go for the full Soviet terror of a 'socialistic' national health service administered by the state. </p> <p>The result of a freeish market is pervasive fraud. June Gibbs Brown, Inspector General of the US Department of Health, estimated that private hospitals were overpaid by $23 billion (\u00a315bn) a year. Fourteen cents in every dollar spent on health were stolen from the government by accident or design. Tales of scams fill the US press. There were the psychiatric hospitals which refused to release cash-earning patients even when they had recovered their wits; the psychologists who billed for 24 hours of therapy a day; and the health-company owners who claimed their son's first BMW was a medical expense. </p> <p>The FBI investigation into HCA showed corruption went beyond the odd rotten apple. 'Columbia's fraudulent cost-reporting practices have infected the cost reports of virtually every health care facility,' the US government said in its affidavit. </p> <p>As in Britain, HCA had engaged in the vigorous buying of beds and built a network of 340 hospitals. It was then able to add new euphemisms to the dictionary of fraud. Its executives tried 'upcoding': the exaggeration of the seriousness of an illness to receive higher fees; 'gaming': the double billing of the state; and 'physician partnerships': the practice of offering doctors shares, subsidised offices and directorships in return to steering patients to HCA hospitals. </p> <p>Mark Gardner, who worked in three Columbia hospitals, testified: 'I committed felonies every day. Let me tell you this a ruthless greedy company. Employees are the largest operating expense. Cut that to the bone. Cut nursing to the bone.' The instructions were obeyed to the letter. One nurse told how she was left to watch 80 heart monitors by herself. John W. Schilling, another whistleblower, said the company was confident it could avoid detection. Advertising and marketing costs were passed off as medical necessities and when the danger of a government auditor getting too close to the truth grew, he was told to buy her off with a job offer. </p> <p>Their testimony sounds strange to British ears. Yet Action for Proper Regulation of Private Hospitals (whose website at <a href=\"http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/littleton/private-hospitals.htm\">www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk</a> I urge you to read before paying for treatment) suggests that many American vices are here in embryo. </p> <p>Private hospitals are dangerous places. They don't have the emergency teams of the NHS and their lovely single rooms are not the safest places to be when you need to attract attention urgently. For all the pampering on offer at HCA's Portland Hospital, the death rate of pregnant women is five times above the national average, as we reported last week. </p> <p>Their parasitic nature is well known - they rely on the NHS to train their staff and to take their patients when an operation goes wrong or an insurance company refuses to pay for complicated treatment - but their imitation of US practices deserves a wider audience. The British Medical Journal claimed in 1993 that at least one-third of all private 'hysterectomies... are unnecessary', while the growth in the number of 'therapeutically useless' removals of tonsils was an 'epidemic'. </p> <p>The NHS, by contrast, has no interest in overcharging or performing pointless operations, quite the reverse. The largest employer in Europe is remarkably free of fiddles in all areas except one: consultants skipping NHS commitments to work in the private sector. There is a perverse incentive: unscrupulous consultants benefit if they persuade patients to pay to see them privately. Invariably, the consultants with the longest waiting lists are those with the largest private practices. </p> <p>Instead of buying out consultants and giving them the generous salaries they deserve - for these are skilled men and women - to work exclusively for the NHS, the Government is making the perverse incentive more attractive still by pumping public funds to the likes of HCA. It claims that it will ensure that health authorities get value for money. If you were to point out that the US Government which has decades of experience of auditing private hospitals still cannot prevent fraud which would dazzle a mafioso, you would be dismissed as an ideological dinosaur. HCA has the advertising slogan 'You've Never Seen Health Care Like This Before'. Indeed you have not. But soon you may.</p>"
