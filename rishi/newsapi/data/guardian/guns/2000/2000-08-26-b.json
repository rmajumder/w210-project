  "<p>If any proof was needed about English football being capable of doing strange things to people, it is surely the fact that even a foreign manager with the laid-back, urbane image of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has got caught up in the intensity of it. </p> <p>The Football Association's action last week in charging Wenger with misconduct - over an alleged push on the fourth official in the dressing room tunnel after Arsenal's defeat at Sunderland last Saturday - is something nobody can have envisaged when he came to England three years ago. No less disconcerting, in view of the way Wenger has been perceived, is that his Arsenal players have been shown 31 red cards over this period. </p> <p>English football is very competitive and has always been noted for its propensity to get overheated. Passion is important and I would hate to see it disappear from our game. </p> <p>Even so, after a remarkable high-octane start to the season with eight red cards inside a week, including three in the Arsenal-Liverpool match in which Patrick Vieira was sent off for the second time in three days - and managers publicly lambasting the referees - there can be no doubt that it is at boiling point. </p> <p>It is difficult to avoid the impression that, unless something is done to bring the temperature down, the game at the top level is going to explode. One calming effect would be for everybody concerned to show greater honesty. </p> <p>For managers, that means not trying to publicly defend players who have been guilty of bad challenges and attempting to shift all the blame for bookings and sendings-off on to referees. Managers, while urging players to perform in a determined manner, must take on greater responsibility to help ensure that it is not taken to the extreme. </p> <p>While referees cannot expect to avoid criticism - and I have hardly been a shrinking violet in this department in the past - we have reached the point where the criticism has become farcical. </p> <p>All managers are quick to draw attention to instances of opposing players stepping out of line on the field, but we all tend to have a blind spot when it comes to recognising and owning up to cases of our own players doing so. </p> <p>One reason is that being seen to support our players is an essential part of the job of getting the best out of them. This particularly applies to the star players, who generally wield greater power than ever before. A number of them needed to be handled more carefully than their counterparts during my own playing career. In some cases, just one managerial word out of place is enough for them to down tools - a situation that few clubs can truly afford. So there is a tendency for managers to treat them with kid gloves. </p> <p>I am not suggesting this applies to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at Arsenal - the manner in which he does his job is none of my business anyway. But when it comes to managers publicly backing members of their teams who are sent off, Wenger is seen as being among those at the top of the list. </p> <p>The subject has again been brought into sharp focus by the recent complaints by Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf that his manager, Gianluca Vialli, did not defend him over his red card for stamping on Harry Kewell in last season's match against Leeds. </p> <p>For me, Leboeuf's attitude was strange to say the least. I cannot see how any manager could have defended him for that without making himself look a fool. </p> <p>It has been the same story with me concerning the Coventry players who have recently been sent off. David Burrows, John Aloisi and David Thompson all deserved to be shown the red card; and it is refreshing to me that all have been honest enough with themselves to acknowledge it. </p> <p>David was sent off twice last season for catching an opponent in the face with his hand. He had run the risk of that happening for some time because he had picked up the Paul Gascoigne habit of throwing his arms out to hold off an opponent when running with the ball. We kept saying to him: 'Keep your arms down - if you don't you'll run into problems with referees.' </p> <p>When it happened, I did not have a go at David publicly. But nor did I say: 'Oh, he was unlucky - the other player's face got in the way of his fist.' </p> <p>In some ways, though, the present so-called 'red rage' nature of Premiership matches does give a slightly misleading picture. </p> <p>While I have seen some dodgy challenges, I would say that this aspect of the English game is nothing like as bad as it was in the Sixties and Seventies. And in terms of blatant physical intimidation, the players most likely to be on the receiving end, the ones known to have a short fuse, get more protection than ever from referees. </p> <p>One change - and it is something I have been reminded of through the view that Vieira is deliberately provoked by opponents - is that teams can no longer get away with using a 'rota' system to commit early fouls on such players. </p> <p>At one time, a defender was rarely booked for his first foul on a player and it was not unusual for that player to be clogged by three different men without the referee taking action against any of them. </p> <p>My own experience of how it worked came in a match for Aberdeen against Airdrie, when someone kicked me on the ankle in the first 10 minutes, inflicting a wound that needed six stitches. The offender immediately looked at the referee and reminded him: 'First one, ref.' </p> <p>'OK then,' the official replied. 'But don't do it again.' If that had happened today, the player would have been booked straight away. </p> <p>I also have to make the point, however, that intimidatory tactics - provided they are within the laws - are an important part of the game. I have lost count of the number of players who tried to provoke me into doing something rash during my career, and was not averse to indulging in this myself. </p> <p>You have to exploit opposition weaknesses - and if one of those weaknesses concerns a player not being able to control his emotions, I see nothing wrong with the general principle of trying to exploit it. </p> <p>I must also point out that it is inevitable that there should be highly-charged physical confrontations at this stage of the season, when the adrenalin levels of the players are probably at their highest. All teams like to think they give 100 per cent commitment throughout the season, but it seems to me that immediately after the recharging of batteries in the summer, there is always a danger of that commitment being allowed to run out of control in the opening weeks. </p> <p>At Coventry experienced the problems of this high-octane factor in last Saturday's home defeat by Middlesbrough. We badly wanted to get off to a good start and some of our players allowed their frustration to get the better of them. One was Thompson, who was sent off for an impetuous tackle; others included John Eustace, whom we substituted because he seemed in danger of attracting the same fate. </p> <p>I was pleased that we showed so much passion, but as I said to the players: 'We don't want you to show it by losing your rag and doing something silly - that's no good to us. We want you to show it by running faster and jumping higher. You have got to stay focused.' </p> <p>I like to think that this will happen not just at Coventry, but at all the other teams who have been involved in refereeing aggro during this crazy start to the season. </p> <p>But before that can happen, we all have to start being more honest.</p>",
  "<p>The first couple of weeks of an English football season rarely fail to disappoint. Just when you think our over-hyped, over-paid and over-rated game cannot possibly spring any new surprises, you find yourself contemplating the saintly Gary McAllister being dismissed for the first time in his career on his Liverpool debut, or the monkish Ars\u00e8ne Wenger facing a fine for roughing up the fourth official at Sunderland. </p> <p>One could add Patrick Vieira's tearfully melodramatic threat to leave if people don't stop picking on him, except we have seen this sort of behaviour before. Not just from Vieira, but from Emmanuel Petit, Eric Cantona and a few others who found it difficult to keep their emotions under control. What Vieira has to accept is that opposing managers will always try to exploit such a weakness in a key player, usually by sending out someone much less talented to try to get up his nose. </p> <p>To justify his handsome wages, Vieira simply has to rise above it and behave like a professional. So does Wenger, who, instead of seeking refuge in Sky TV replays and Andy Gray's absurd self-importance, has a duty to acknowledge that his player lost his temper twice within three days. Winding up temperamental players is a trick as old as the game, and when it is not happening to their own star men, most managers don't see anything wrong with it. </p> <p>The stakes have been raised significantly in recent years, however, by new guidelines to referees and stricter interpretation of dangerous play. This change was brought about by a desire to protect skilful players and encourage attackers, but the balance seems to be slipping back towards the cloggers and spoilers. If referees insist on sticking to the letter of the law and overlooking some fairly blatant examples of provocation, the scope is there for limited players to set out with the sole intention of getting leading players dismissed. </p> <p>Vieira's sending-off at Sunderland was a case in point. The retaliation was mild, and Darren Williams did receive a caution in rather belated acknowledgment of his role as instigator, but Sunderland kept 11 men on the pitch while Arsenal went down to 10. Again, that would not have happened had Vieira kept his cool, and nor would Wenger's subsequent spot of unpleasantness, but referees who give the impression they read the game less well than the rulebook are only likely to inflame such situations. </p> <p>Players are only human - referees just need to appear more so. Ask Peter Beardsley, who, judging by his brilliant deconstruction of the above controversy almost before it happened last week, is wasting his time as a Radio 5 Live summariser. </p> <p>Send for the whistle and black shorts now, Peter. Your country needs you.</p>",
  "<p>Wendy Perriam starts work at 6.30am, wearing an old quilted dressing gown, writing her novels by hand in a scrawl and surrounded by pictures of the Virgin Mary and others that have a particular meaning for her. </p> <p>Such themes are central to her lapsed Catholic novels, the fourteenth of which, Lying , came out this summer. A full-time novelist, she is one of a growing number of people who work from home. Left to their own devices, they usually create a different working environment to the one they left behind in the office. </p> <p>But their styles are completely individual. Ruth, a crime writer, worked at the other end of the day when she began writing. 'I found myself getting up at noon and working through to 4am. I had to be able to cut the world out. It just gravitated that way,' she explained. </p> <p>And Val McDermid, best-selling author of Killing the Shadows and other gory crime novels, starts at her desk about 9am, but needs to play computer games and find other distractions before the creative juices start flowing a couple of hours later. </p> <p>All three women graduated to writing from more conventional careers - Perriam in advertising, Ruth in teaching and McDermid in journalism. But even though all of them are immensely productive - averaging 14 books each - they would not be welcome in the traditional office. </p> <p>Perriam would have to be locked in a cupboard because of her breach of the dress code; Ruth would be accused of skiving because she arrived late; and McDermid would be quickly fired for misusing company equipment and not devoting all her time to her work. </p> <p>But things are going to change. Business is realising that most workers are more productive when they have some control over their own conditions. And there is also a clear link between a relaxed environment and creativity. The call of 'Eureka' came from the bath, not the desk. Coleridge dreamt the lines of Kubla Khan while asleep. And Charles Dickens did much of his writing in the family drawing room as he chatted to friends and played with his children. </p> <p>New businesses are not only recognising the connection between relaxation and creativity, but they are also finding the confidence to trust their employees and relax the old-fashioned rules. Sir Richard Branson is a frontrunner. The casual dress is not just a statement about being modern, it is also about being closer to the creative process. </p> <p>Margaret Briffa, an intellectual property lawyer, swept away decades of convention when she started Briffa &amp; Co in London's Islington five years ago. Unlike traditional lawyers who tend to reduce eye contact in their office seating plans, Briffa's team of eight have arranged their desks in a circle. 'We can discuss things as they come along,' she says. 'This is very good for helping our reaction times. Having to see your boss by going through a door is a barrier.' </p> <p>One of her lawyers is an afternoon and evening person and prefers to start work at lunchtime. She did have reservations about this at first, but now says: 'So long as people do the work, I'm not fussed. And we also have a lot of US business - so it's helpful that he stays later.' </p> <p>The most dramatic thing she did was to encourage her lawyers to bill clients for four hours a day - rather than the six or seven which is almost uniform throughout the rest of the profession. This means that the firm's income is possibly only two-thirds of what it might have been. But Briffa is not so sure about that: 'If you are time-pressured, you cannot take a step back. Taking the stress off ourselves makes us better lawyers. Also, it leads to our getting better business. Our clients tell us things they wouldn't have if they thought they were being charged for the conversation.' </p> <p>Frank Eve, a director of internet mortgage company E-loan, has been able to import some of the flexibility he had when he worked alone to the company's 50-strong team in Redhill. 'There is no monitoring of the hours people do here. If someone wanted to go at 3pm, there would be no checking. But we have found that people have actually been working longer hours here.' In fact, the directors have become anxious about the possibility of some staff working too hard - and they sometimes try to set an example by leaving early. </p> <p>Before joining E-loan, Eve was running a business called Flexemortgage from his home. 'I worked very different hours, depending on what was going on and also on my mood. Flexibility allows an individual to follow their own creativity. If you give people arbitrary rules about working 9 to 5, it is very restricting for people whose most creative time is 10 at night. I was much more creative in that environment than in a traditional office.' </p> <p>Getting the right balance of flexibility and creativity is crucial. Even the most devoted employees will struggle if there are no deadlines or other constraints placed upon them. You only have to look at the high correlation between creativity, flexibility and disaster in the pop world to see why business leaders might be confused. No amount of creativity would recompense them if their staff started behaving like Liam Gallagher. </p> <p>People who have successfully worked alone are usually very disciplined. Eve was no stranger to 16-hour days. Ruth was able to produce a book in two weeks. Perriam puts in six hours of writing a day. McDermid says: 'You have to be even more disciplined if you work on your own.' </p> <p>All beneficiaries of a new-found freedom, none of them would return to the rule-bound environment. 'It wouldn't suit me to go back to a law factory,' says Briffa. 'What killed me as a teacher was knowing what I'd be doing in May next year,' says Ruth. 'I felt shackled, trapped and tied. I hated it.' Perriam says: 'I'd have to wear make-up. You also waste a lot of energy getting there. And then there are all the distractions.' </p> <p>Strangely, however, it is often employees, rather than bosses, who oppose change, says Jan Young, architect, designer and facilitator of change for architect DEGW: 'Creating these changes often means, in practice, giving up your own desk or own base. And many people are resistant to change and say they don't have time for it.'</p>",
  "<p>If you've just come back from a perfect holiday you may now be fantasising about living on that Mediterranean island or in that tiny village in the West Country. </p> <p>This time of year is probably the ripest for thoughts of making a permanent escape to favourite holiday destinations, away from the grind and traffic, noise and pollution, demanding bosses and general ordinariness to something more satisfying. Should this be the year that you move to the South of France, buy a country post office or settle on a Greek island? Not unless you put in some serious homework first. </p> <p>Moving to one's favourite holiday destination can be the beginning of a new life (see case studies) but it is not an easy option. </p> <p>If you are struggling to keep your life together in a city or town, it is unlikely that such a move will improve your financial or emotional position unless you choose your destination with great care. </p> <p>Oonagh Karanjia runs an agency, Crete Property Consultants, dealing in homes on the Greek Island, and has seen Britons move there with varying degrees of success. 'The ones that do best are generally those who were not looking for a dramatic change,' she says. </p> <p>Greece is one of the most popular holiday playgrounds for the British and, because of the weakness of the drachma against the pound, now seems hugely attractive to British tourists as a place to settle. </p> <p>Sue Averies-Kartanou has lived in Greece for 15 years. She and her Greek husband run shops in the busy resort of Nidri on the island of Lefkas. Aristotle Onassis's island of Scorpios is a stone's throw from Nidri. </p> <p>These are islands of crystal clear water, pure white beaches, friendly locals and cheap alcohol and cigarettes. Not surprisingly, Sue has seen an increasing number of tourists decide to make Lefkas their home. </p> <p>For many, though, the move ends disastrously. The reality is a string of poorly paid casual jobs and unless these people have left assets in Britain, it is virtually impossible for them to return because property prices will have soared. </p> <p>For some, the idyll ends with drink problems, encouraged by the cheap alcohol in Greece, and broken marriages. </p> <p>'I think quite a lot don't do their homework,' says Sue. 'There is no real structure for getting jobs unless you work on a casual basis.' </p> <p>Why, she wonders, do people assume that they will be able to manage on a part-time income in a poor country like Greece when this would not be possible in England. </p> <p>'Two hundred thousand drachmas a month (barely \u00a3400) would be considered a good living. That would be [for] people like civil servants and teachers.' </p> <p>Cigarettes and alcohol are cheap, but food, clothes and cars are not necessarily much cheaper than in the UK. Parents who bring children, says Sue, will discover that Greek parents pay for extensive private lessons in order to educate their children well. But even getting a good education will not guarantee a good living. 'There are a lot of doctors driving taxis and running tourist shops.' </p> <p>Greece has a state pension scheme and a health service, but Sue has private pensions and medical insurance because she wants extra protection. </p> <p>Those who cannot speak the language are at a particular disadvantage, and she is often called in by newcomers to help them deal with paperwork. </p> <p>She recalls one couple who rented a restaurant and did not realise they were paying rent that, by local standards, was exorbitant. It was difficult to organise supplies from wholesalers without speaking Greek. </p> <p>'People who have made a success of it have researched it and have economic security,' observes Sue. 'They haven't put all their eggs in one basket.' </p> <p>Retired people with UK pension income who buy homes on the island for extended stays tend to do well out of their moves, she says. </p> <p>Anyone contemplating migration to the island should spend a couple of hours talking to a lawyer or a well-informed local who can give them some idea of the realities. </p> <p>Oonagh agrees that people moving to their favourite holiday spot often fail to 'think it all the way through'. </p> <p>'Buying in a place that you've had a good holiday in is not a good basis for buying. Go in February, the worst month of the year [for weather], and see what life is like then.' </p> <p>Oonagh says that older couples may fail to appreciate that being together 24 hours a day poses a challenge to their marriage. </p> <p>Those who move successfully rarely do so to escape an unsatisfactory life at home, and they 'don't have it in mind to vegetate'. </p> <p><strong>Offshore, but not all at sea </strong></p> <p>Moving abroad involves more planning than you would faced with if you simply upped sticks for a favourite UK holiday spot. Martin Mullany knows the financial challenges of moving abroad as he is an independent financial adviser who recently moved to Mauritius following an excellent holiday there. </p> <p>Mullany has set up his own financial advice consultancy, Strategic Planning International. Here is his checklist for preparing such a move abroad :</p> <p>\u0095 List the factors you would take into account if you were moving within the UK, including location of your planned home in relation to shops and amenities, and access to transport, medical facilities, schools, work, and friends. Ask yourself who you know there, and how you will get to know people.</p> <p>\u0095 Find a way to speak to people in the area. The Corona Society helps people from the UK to prepare for a move abroad by putting them in touch with knowledgeable residents. It also organises briefings on the cultural and financial aspects of a move. A one-day briefing costs \u00a3250, a cultural briefing only is \u00a375 and a telephone briefing \u00a325. Tel: 0207 610 4407.</p> <p>\u0095 Consider your financial situation. Will you retire or work? Can you afford to live without working? Will you need a work permit?</p> <p>\u0095 Do some 'negative' planning. What if something or everything goes wrong? Make sure you can afford to return to the UK in an emergency. It is important to have an emergency fund. You might need to call on it for anything from a family death to a change in the political climate in the country you move to.</p> <p>\u0095 Don't rule out the possibility that you will not be able to adjust to living permanently in a culture you enjoyed in small doses on holiday.</p> <p>\u0095 Check that your will is valid where you are going. In some countries you will have to dispose of assets according to specific rules.</p> <p>\u0095 Ask the Department of Social Security for a forecast of your state pension; there is a section on the forecast form, BR19, that applies to pensions paid abroad. It may be worth making voluntary National Insurance payments to protect your state pension. But be aware that in most Commonwealth countries the UK state pension is not increased when it goes up in this country.</p> <p>\u0095 If you are investing and plan to continue, there is no change in the nature of the investments - but the vehicles you use will be different. You won't be able to use Isas or Tessas. Assuming you become a non-UK taxpayer, you will need an offshore account where interest is paid gross. For stock market investment you will probably want to consider offshore funds.</p> <p>Take care, as the regulation of funds based outside the UK is not necessarily as rigorous as in Britain. If you have substantial assets and don't feel confident about managing them yourself, find a UK adviser with detailed knowledge of the expatriate market.</p> <p>\u0095 The position with private pensions varies depending on the type of scheme.</p> <p>You won't be able to continue to contribute but will be able to keep the pensions until you want to retire.</p> <p>Find out how much they would produce. Would it be enough to maintain a reasonable lifestyle if you decide to remain abroad? How will you save for retirement when you move?</p> <p>\u0095 Consider the long term. If your eventual goal is to retire to the UK, there is no point in feeling rich in another country to find you are the poorest person in Britain on your return.</p> <p>\u0095 A large number of UK residents who go abroad to live end up returning. Keep a property in the UK so you have a home to come back to. If you do sell, invest some of the proceeds in a rental property.</p> <p>You will have to use an agent; an occupational hazard when you live miles away. You will need to pay tax on any income from the property, after expenses. You will need to complete forms to enable the agent to release rent without deduction of tax at source.</p> <p>Agents are obliged to withhold tax on the whole rent if you do not obtain clearance from the Revenue, even if you only make a 1 per cent profit.</p> <p>\u0095 Make sure your life insurance policies and any protec tion policies will still be valid. Permanent health insurance, which provides an income in case of a serious illness or disability, will probably become invalid, or the insurer would insist on repatriation if you claimed.</p> <p>\u0095 Consider private medical insurance and check that any policy you buy covers the new country.</p> <p>\u0095 Check what the tax position would be if you returned to the UK to live in the property. In some cases it is better to return to live in it for a time before selling, while for others it is best to sell while abroad.</p> <p>\u0095 You will need to ensure that you are treated as non-resident for tax purposes. Obtain forms from the Inland Revenue and complete them before leaving the UK. You normally have to be out of the country for at least six months to become non-resident but can register in advance for this status, enabling you to register for and offshore bank and savings account.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have assets to dispose of that might bring a capital gains tax bill, it is normally best to sell after leaving this country. But you should take advice on this; if you return too quickly you may have the same CGT bill as if you had not left. In some cases it is best to sell after leaving the UK but before settling in a new country whose tax laws could affect you.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have UK domicile (moving country normally only affects residence, not domicile) your estate in the UK will still be liable to inheritance tax.</p> <p>\u0095 You may need to consider whether to move assets to the new country. This depends on its taxation and how secure it is politically. Recent troubles in Zimbabwe explain why many residents in Africa invest via trusts. If you have substantial assets you will need advice.</p> <p>\u0095 When moving, check whether your destination country will make you pay duty for importing your own belongings.</p> <p>\u0095 For information on taxation of non-residents look at the Inland Revenue website, <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a> .</p>",

  "<p>Bruges is an eccentric mix of darkness and beauty. The beauty comes from 100km of winding canals lined with gabled houses. Darkness is in the works of its artists, the Flemish Primitives, who specialised in giant paintings of disembowelment; and Heironymous Bosch's scenes of bizarre horror in its galleries. </p> <p>From the 12th to the 15th centuries, Bruges was the financial hub of Europe, the site of the world's first stock exchange and the centre of the diamond and lace trades. Then darkness descended when the waterway that linked it to the sea began to silt up; merchants and traders left, and the city slept for 400 years. </p> <p>In the late 19th century, the author Georges Rodenbach wrote a novel set in the city's abandoned streets, called Bruges the Dead, and the Belgian elite started to return </p> <p>Because Bruges was never redeveloped, it is now the best-preserved medieval city in western Europe. There are no billboards, no high rises, few neon signs and traffic is regulated. You can walk for three hours without leaving cobbled streets. The only sound is clarion bells and the clatter of horse-drawn carriages. </p> <p>Four hours from London by train, it makes for a convenient city break. More than two million visitors a year come to see its art and architecture, taste its beers and visit its antiques markets; in 2002, Bruges will be European city of culture. But away from the centre and within walking distance of the main attractions, there's another side to the city in the basement jazz clubs, karaoke bars, design shops and organic restaurants. The city is compact, so the main sights and the underground scene are within walkingdistance of each other. </p> <p>There are also lush, canal-side lawns, where you can enjoy a picnic and watch the world go by - in Bruges' case an odd mix of artists, Benedictine nuns and yuppies who do the hour's commute to Brussels each morning. And, because the city falls on the Flemish side of Belgium's linguistic divide, ordering in French will get you dirty looks while the lazier option of speaking English will spark conversations with multilingual locals. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong></p> <p> Start at the Markt square early in the morning when the cobbles are being scrubbed and street vendors trim the seams of waffles with nail scissors. </p> <p>To get your bearings, climb the Belfort, an 84m-high, 13th-century belfry which, for Bfr100 (\u00a31.55), provides a view over the city to the sea. </p> <p>A two-minute walk away is the Burg, the centre of medieval Bruges which hosts nine centuries of different architectural styles. A short stroll south takes you to the antique and flea markets perched on the bank of the Dijver canal, in front of a cluster of art galleries. </p> <p>The Groeninge museum (Bfr200) has an impressive collection of early Flemish masters such as Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling. It also houses major works by Bosch and Belgian surrealists Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Paul Delvaux. </p> <p>Continue south down Mariastraat to the banks of the Minnewater (Lake of Love) and the Begijnhof community. These white-washed houses were once home to the beguines, a lay sisterhood who lived and dressed as nuns but who did not take vows so they could return at will to their lovers in the secular world. </p> <p>In the early evening, walk north from Jan Van Eyckplein, along the quiet canalside Potterierei into the residential side of Bruges for quiet caf\u00e9s. </p> <p><strong> Guided tours</strong></p> <p> Guided tours are one of Bruges's biggest industries but choose carefully. </p> <p>A walking tour of the centre (between Bfr150 and 1,500) won't tell you any more than a guidebook. </p> <p>A boat tour along the canals with a driver barking down a megaphone seems conspicuous - locals don't use the canals - but it is the best way to get a view of the medieval architecture. Tickets cost Bfr190 and boats depart from the Djiver every 10 minutes. Queues are long, so go last thing in the evening when the city empties out. </p> <p>A 35-minute horse-and-trap ride round the city centre costs Bfr1,000 for four and leaves from the Burg. Drivers talk mostly about their horses. Book at the tourist office (+50 44 86 86) to avoid queues. </p> <p>For Bfr650, you can take a mountain-bike tour with an English guide through the villages surrounding Bruges. Contact the Back Road Bike company (+50 37 04 70). </p> <p><strong> Where to drink</strong></p> <p> The three best local beers are Brugse Tarwebier, a pale wheat beer drunk with a slice of lemon, brewed at De Gouden Boom in Langestraat; Straffe Hendrik brewed at Walplein, 26; and the stronger Brugse Tripel. But there are more than 400 brews in Bruges. You can sample them all at the breweries, along with a throng of other tourists, but it's better to head for a quiet caf\u00e9 near a canal. Walk east up Hoogstraat for the best beer gardens. </p> <p>Bars start to fill up around 11pm. The yuppies congregate on Vlamingstraat. The hip crowd heads north up Kuipersstraat after 11pm, or south to the T'Zand. </p> <p>To find out what's happening on the alternative scene, check notices in the windows of the record shops on Hoogstraat. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat</strong> </p> <p> On a hot day, buy a picnic from one of the delicatessens on Vlamingstraat or Adrian Willaerstraat. If you are vegetarian, try the macrobiotic deli at Katelijnestraat, 140. Pick up some chocolate pralines from the highly-kitsch De Clerk chocolaterie on Academiestraat, 19. Then head for the lawns of Minnewater or Kor Astridpark. </p> <p>Most restaurants in or around the Markt are touristy and overpriced. Instead, head into the back streets and small squares. For Flemish-style mussels with spinach or Bruges-style boiled eel, try Poules Moules in Simon Stevinplein, where dinner for two with wine costs around \u00a330. The best bouillabaisse is at Cafedraal brasserie on Zilverstraat, 38, but book early (+50 34 08 45). Vegetarians should head for Biosfeer organic restaurant, tucked away at Acadmiestraat, 15 or the T'Brugsch pancake house at Helmstraat, 3. </p> <p>For the freshest waffles, sit outside the Grand Caf\u00e9 Belfort, Markt, 25, or buy them from street vendors for around \u00a31. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong></p> <p> Bruges has more than 100 hotels and B&amp;Bs. But they tend to be overbooked in the high season, which starts at Easter and lasts until November. Book early or go for last minute deals at <a href=\"http://www.belgiantravel.co.uk\">www.belgiantravel.co.uk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.europeanlife.co.uk\">www.europeanlife.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>At the glamourous end of the market is the Hotel De Orangerie perched on a beautiful canal bank in the centre of town. Double rooms start at Bfr6,950. There is a vast selection of mid-range hotels. One of the best is the Hotel Aragon, tucked in a quiet, winding street to the north of the city centre. </p> <p>Another option is a holiday flat. New companies letting attic studios and modern apartments are springing up every month.

  "<p>Skiddaw is often crowded with walkers on the easy ascent from Keswick. But this doesn't deter Lord Bragg, who comes at it from the desolate north and rarely sees a soul before the summit. </p> <p>It's a favourite walk of his, starting from his cottage on the northern rim of the Lake District, eight miles from where he was born. Like Scafell Pike via Piers Gill or Helvellyn via Nethermost Cove, it shows the unusual side of a familiar mountain. </p> <p>\"Skiddaw's a grand old fell,\" he says. \"It's underestimated because it's overused. But there's a way to wander up Skiddaw that remains deeply attractive.\" </p> <p>The route takes him at first through the grounds of a large house, which burnt down in 1958: \"There are still traces of its grandeur - water gardens and pathways through the woods, and there the kind of feeling you get in LP Hartley of 'once there was, and now he's gone'. It's a nice, melancholy start.\" </p> <p>Cutting across the fields, he passes a little-known curiosity - a sandstone pillar with the carved head of the great huntsman John Peel, whose grave is not far away - \"a kind of cross between the Lake District and Easter Island: very odd.\" </p> <p>An ancient drovers' road, layered into the hillside, gives some fast walking before he heads for Dash Falls. </p> <p>\"I like the waterfall - it's so gloomy, doesn't seem to get any sun at all. It could be one of those terrible dells where the fifth most important character in a novel drowns himself or herself. The long valley at the top has that desolate feeling I particularly enjoy.\" </p> <p>This brings him to a height of 1,500ft and a clump of trees sheltering a desolate former shooting lodge called Skiddaw House, now a youth hostel. From there, it's about an hour's steady climbing to the top across a pathless grassy hump called Sale How. </p> <p>If it's a clear day, the reward at the summit is the sudden view of Keswick clustered round the head of DerwentWater and, beyond it to the south, the full vista of the lakeland mountains. There's also a stone shelter and - as likely as not - clusters of other walkers. </p> <p>\"The last time I was up there was with my son Tom; we spent about 10 minutes watching a hawk, only about 10 or 15 feet from the ground, in a very high wind. We were sitting against the cairn getting battered, and it was perfectly steady, seeming to enjoy the wind hitting it. It was very, very good.\" </p> <p>The descent towards Keswick, with the lake growing from the size of a handkerchief, is the highlight of the walk for Bragg, full of memories of school trips and family outings: \"It's a mixture of landscape and history and literature and personal history. It has lots of layers for me. </p> <p>\"Then it's into Keswick, through the park, and into the pub. It's about six hours of walking - a good day whatever the weather - and, because you're going over a mountain and into a town, there's a feeling of arrival, a feeling of going from nowhere into somewhere. </p> <p>\"And I just feel better for it. I wouldn't like to make any great claims that some people do about walking - most spectacularly, Wordsworth. He did walk his poems, didn't he? Composed them while walking, with a walking metre in his verse, if you like. </p> <p>\"And I know quite a few writers who swear by walking as an aid to composition. It doesn't happen as neatly as that for me. I just feel six or seven hours out in that sort of empty place is something I'm very lucky to have. I'd even go as far as saying I need it, although that seems to be rather overprivileged.\"</p> <p><strong>'They know not Skiddaw who have climbed it only from Keswick!\"</strong></p> <p> So says Alfred Wainwright, the late guru of Lake District fanatics, in the 28 handwritten, densely-illustrated pages which he devotes to the mountain in his 1962 guide, The Northern Fells. </p> <p>\"It is an easy climb, yes; its slopes are smooth and grassy, yes; it has no frightful precipices, no rugged outcrops, agreed; it offer nothing of interest or entertainment to rock-gymnasts, agreed. But are they not quite minor failings? Are they failings at all?</p> <p>\"The summit is buttressed magnificently by a circle of lesser heights, all of the members of the proud Skiddaw family, the whole forming a splendid and complete example of the structure of mountains, especially well seen from all directions because of its isolation.</p> <p>\"Its lines are smooth, its curves graceful; but because the slopes are steep everywhere, the quick build-up of the massif from valley levels to central summit is appreciated at a glance. This, then is Skiddaw, a giant in stature. But an affable and friendly giant.\" </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>The best rail stations for the northern Lake District are Penrith, Carlisle and Wigton: national rail enquiries 0345 484950.

  "<p><strong> Aiding and Abetting</strong> <br>Muriel Spark <br>Viking, \u00a312.99, 182pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502452433,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>God, or the absence of God, has always been Muriel Spark's subject, so it comes as little surprise that the Devil makes an appearance on the very first page of her new novel. A patient explains his problem to a psychiatrist: \" 'I have come to consult you,' he said, 'because I have no peace of mind. Twenty-five years ago I sold my soul to the Devil.' \"</p> <p>By page three we learn that the patient has arrived at the offices of Dr Hildegard Wolf on the recommendation of a friend, a troubled priest, who gives him this insight into her methods: \" 'She advised me not to try to pray. She advised me to shut up and listen. Read the gospel, she said. Jesus is praying to you for sympathy. You have to see his point of view, what he had to put up with. Listen, don't talk. Read the Bible. Take it in. God is talking, not you.' \"</p> <p>This may sound like an unconventional therapeutic tack, but Dr Wolf, whose skill has been \"perfected by herself\", is not simply iconoclastic; she is also a charlatan. She is her own creation - she has changed her identity, shedding a previous life in which she was Beate Pappenheim, the famous stigmatic of Munich - and a fake. Now, she sits in a sumptuous suite on the Boulevard St Germain, charging her clients $1,500 for sessions that last three-quarters of an hour, effecting a talking cure that consists mainly of her own idle chatter about her carefully crafted life. </p> <p>Hildegard is another of Spark's diabolical characters, the latest in a long line that includes the monstrous Jean Brodie and the Abbess of Crewe, whose penchant for surveillance enabled Spark to mount an effective satire on Watergate. Fuelled by their belief in a particular destiny - their own - these maniacal manipulators elevate themselves to positions beyond law, ethics, morality - in fact, as the Abbess herself notes, to the realm of mythology, where action and charisma count for all. But if Aiding and Abetting has a theme, it is that sympathy is both relative and unpredictable: in other words, when monsters are cornered, their charisma begins to work overtime and we may not find ourselves invulnerable to their charms. </p> <p>Hildegard's Faustian patient tells her that he is Lord Lucan. She has become used to such grandiose claims: when her new charge strolls into her consulting room, she already has a disturbed Lord Lucan on her books. And the dilemma of which man, if either, to believe, and whether she should be treating guilt or delusion, or both, becomes secondary the minute one of them threatens to place a call to Interpol and acquaint them with the whereabouts of the vanished stigmatic. As the novel unfolds, the psychiatrist herself becomes the quarry, with the two would-be Earls circling menacingly around her, themselves startled by a fresh threat of capture.</p> <p>Spark's economical, elliptical prose is alive with understated comedy: one has the sense that her talent for farce is constantly held in check by the seriousness of her ideas. One of the Lucan-chasers, an old gaming pal named Joe stirred into belated curiosity by his attraction to a young woman trying to write a Lucan book, ponders the persistent allure of the case, and decides that \"the disappearance of Lucan partakes of the realistic-surrealistic\", a description that could equally well apply to this novel, whose byways are vivid with malice and deliciously subtle spite. </p> <p>In the novel's realistic strand - if one can term \"realistic\" an invented present for one of the world's most notorious escapees - Spark concerns herself not simply with the psychological truths that might underwrite Lucan's botched attempt to murder his wife (a brutal attack that left the couple's nanny with her head caved in in a Belgravia basement), but with the motives that inspired his friends and confidants - his aiders and abetters - to spirit him away beyond the reach of the law. He was, by several accounts, a dullard, an obsessional gambler, a sexual sadist, a ruthless man whose social charms barely concealed his fecklessness. \"He beat his wife with a cane,\" notes Hildegard. \"Very sick, that.\" </p> <p>But, like Dr Wolf and Jean Brodie before her, Lucan was also a determined and consummate actor, as Joe points out: \"There was a kind of psychological paralysis, almost an unconscious conspiracy to let him get away. It was not only that he was a member of the aristocracy, a prominent upper-class fellow, it was that he had pitched his life and all his living arrangements to that proposition. His proposition was: I am a seventh Earl, I am an aristocrat, therefore I can do what I like, I am untouchable.\" </p> <p>As she skilfully evokes the vanishing world of the nobly born - endless games of baccarat and poker, the Clermont Club, the races - Spark invests it with its own moral atmosphere. Reflecting on the delayed advent of conscience among Lucan's protectors, Joe notes that \"since Lucan's day, snobs have been greatly marginalized\", suggesting that few of them would now be able to afford the luxury of funding a ne'er-do-well's furtive travels around the globe. </p> <p>And not simply one ne'er-do-well, but two. As the man we are more inclined to believe in as Lucan starts to display real psychological distress - the effect, he reckons, of being declared legally dead by his wife - the more we come to view his doppelg\u00e4nger as the true source of evil in the novel. His persecution of both \"Lucky\" and Hildegard is low-grade, trashy; by comparison, they are class acts. Suddenly, we find ourselves in sympathy with a murderer and a fraudster. </p> <p>There are flaws in this ambitious, rewardingly complex novel. A recurrent motif of blood, for example, links Hildegard, or Beate, who covered herself with her menstrual blood to fake the five wounds that made her famous, and Lucan, whose memories of murder are fraught with the excessive and unstaunchable flow that issued from the head of his nanny. \"Once it gets going, there is no stopping blood,\" Hildegard muses, but by the time its religious connotations are also suggested by the lamb chops that Lucan is fond of eating, it is a decidedly overworked metaphor. The fantastical African ending is distinctly sub-Waugh, and speaks of a surprising lack of authorial control. </p> <p>But these quibbles should not detract from the enjoyment of this exceptionally intelligent book. It is hard to think of another writer who could devise such a brashly absurd plot and then execute it with both flair and gravity. Spark has always had the facility to be silkily suave as she goes about examining our predilection for worshipping false gods. In Aiding and Abetting, it is the nature of charm that attracts her unflinching eye, and that proves itself to be very much in the eye of the beholder.</p>",
  "<b>Dear Ruth, </b> <br> It is a quarter of a century since the Equal Pay Act, but women still earn only 80 pence for every pound pocketed by men. There have been scores of initiatives to help women break through the corporate glass ceiling, but just 3% of directors are female. But of course, you know all this. <p>It is not because women are less educated or skilled \u0096 look at last week\u0092s A-level results \u0096 or because employers think women aren\u0092t up to the job, or because women are uninterested in jobs or money. Twentysomething female graduates earn as much as their male counterparts. Women continue to lose at work because they have children, and so their career paths are broken. Men have children and continue working as if nothing had happened. We either accept the resulting gap in pay and promotion, as conservatives do, or level the playing field. My view is that we have to give men the same rights to paid time off for childcare as women (44 weeks, with the first six paid at 90% wages). </p> <p>Only when men bear equal responsibility for parenting will women have a shot at equality. Not before.<br>Yours sincerely,<br> Richard Reeves<br> The Industrial Society</p> <p><b>Dear Richard</b><br> I found your proposals suggesting that men should bear equal responsibility for parenting very interesting. I do have objections. Your statement that women continue to lose at work because they have career breaks, while true, implies that all women define their success in life mainly in terms of careers and not in terms of motherhood. For many women this is not true. Many of my friends were only too pleased to give up work and look after their children.</p> <p>They feel insulted when this is seen as less important or prestigious than having a job, which can be tedious, unrewarding and unglamorous. They regard bringing up their children as the finest thing they have ever done.</p> <p>Men are different from women and women are on the whole psychologically and biologically better equipped to be the principal child nurturers. A recent report by a Lancaster University psychology professor concluded that most fathers saw their parental role as protector and breadwinner and preferred to leave nurturing to their womenfolk. This may be a non-PC view. But men should be given an opportunity to behave as they feel in this matter without being criticised.</p> <p>If men took as much leave as women over the birth of a baby, the disruption to many firms (especially small ones) would be horrendous and increase the resentment by the childless towards those, especially women, with children. </p> <p>A recent report in Management Today suggested that such resentment was growing. <br>Yours sincerely,<br> Ruth Lea<br> Head of the policy unit, Institute of Directors</p> <p><b>Dear Ruth,</b><br> You have cut straight to the heart of the matter. But I could not agree with you less. Yes, many women are happy to devote themselves to their families. But so are many men; they are denied the opportunity to do so. I am not arguing that bringing up children is an unimportant job. I am arguing that it is too important for just one parent.</p> <p>Women are not naturally better at looking after children than men \u0096 they just do more of it. Given the chance, men acquire childcare skills as quickly as women. It is true that today most people support a fairly traditional division of labour. But attitudes change. A few decades ago, working mothers of young children faced widespread disapproval. Employers will face disruption when fathers take time off, exactly as they currently do with mothers. But every move to give workers more time off \u0096 from shorter working days to maternity leave \u0096 has been seen as a threat to profits. Capitalism seems to have survived. Even if there is a cost, this is far outweighed by the benefits to men, children and, most of all, to women. <br>Yours,<br> Richard</p> <p><b>Dear Richard</b><br> Many fathers are devoted to their families. But the survey I quoted, by psychology professor Charlie Lewis, stated that most fathers see their main duty as bringing in money while mothers look after their children. This is particularly the case when the child is very young. This would suggest that the take-up rate for men for paternity leave over the first months of a child\u0092s life would be low.</p> <p>I do not believe that men have the same instinctive parenting skills as women. There are exceptions to every generalisation. But exceptions do not overturn the basic differences between men and women in the reproductive process. This may be regarded as hopelessly reactionary, but to deny it is to deny the essence of what distinguishes men from women. I am not as sanguine about the impact on businesses as you are concerning yet more regulations. The current government has, for its own social engineering agenda, introduced extra employment regulations that serious problems. Even though I speculate that the take-up for paternity leave would be low, I stick to the view that such leave could prove devastating for small businesses already being strangled in red tape. <br>Yours,<br> Ruth</p> <p><b>Dear Ruth,</b><br> Your two arguments contradict each other. If men are not interested in childcare, and so will not take up paid paternity leave, how will it be devastating for business? </p> <p>Men are rethinking their role as fathers \u0096 young men rank loving your child and being responsible ahead of breadwinning. Nor do women have instinctively better parenting skills than men \u0096 that is simply a stereotype underpinned by law. I agree that we are a long way, as a society, from seeing this. But in a few decades time your view will seem as outdated as the one that women aren\u0092t really up to the rigours of paid labour. The only significant biological difference is that women can breastfeed \u0096 and I imagine most couples would use the mother\u0092s leave in the first months, with the father taking over if she returns to work. The need for childcare does not end with the need for breast milk.</p> <p>My proposals to give men the same rights as women are about choice. If men don\u0092t want to take time off, so be it. But I think they will and I think their partners will want them to. Employed women could then compete with their male colleagues on equal terms. <br>Yours,<br> Richard</p> <p><b>Dear Richard</b><br> I think it is very clear that the amount of disruption to individual businesses would be conditional on the take-up rate. If many men did take the leave, the difficulties for businesses would be significant and could then stimulate the backlash by the childless against parents. You talk of extending choice. But your proposals are only for the parents of young children.</p> <p>I am not surprised to see young men rank loving their children ahead of breadwinning. But this doesn\u0092t mean they wish to do the nurturing. Your points that women do not have better parenting instincts than men and that the only biological difference is that women breastfeed, left me gasping. That a woman carries the baby and gives birth colours attitudes. Why do women usually get custody after divorce cases? No amount of paternity leave can change this.</p> <p> And neither should it. <br>Yours,<br> Ruth</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iod.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">The Institute of Directors</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.indsoc.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">The Industrial Society</a> (featuring their latest report, Mothers vs Men)</p>",
  "<p>Ford Motor Company yesterday joined some 4,200 American car dealers to launch <a href=\"http://www.FordDirect.com\" target=\"_new\">FordDirect.com</a>, an online car sales company which will compete against independent websites in the US. </p> <p>The joint venture with the Ford Dealer Council, a trade body for dealers in the world's second largest car manufacturer, will allow buyers to order a customised car or truck and arrange delivery. The buyer will be referred to a local dealer for final delivery and customer service. </p> <p>Wall Street analysts said the move reflected the difficulties facing websites as laws in most US states insist final referrals on car sales go to local dealers. </p> <p>One US analyst, who refused to be named, said FordDirect.com was a way for dealers themselves to \"keep up with the times\" after initially seeing online sales as a threat. </p> <p>\"It would be much more efficient to just bypass the middleman but it can't be done in this country,\" he said. </p> <p>The new company, with an independent board of directors, will be jointly owned by the dealers and Ford, although the dealers will retain control. </p> <p>Jerry Reynolds, chairman of the national Ford Dealer Council, called the deal \"unprecedented\" as it represented \"the first instance of a Fortune 500 company and its distribution channel joining forces to create an independent internet company\". </p> <p>GM, the world's largest car manufacturer, has expressed an interest in setting up a similar company. </p> <p>It was unclear whether the website, which will start selling cars in California next month, will offer price comparisons with other manufacturers. </p> <p>One attraction of independent sites, such as Carpoint and Authobytel, is their claim to feature a wide range of goods.

  "US regulators ordered the country's airlines to check the tail elevator controls on Boeing 767 jets yesterday after checks revealed failed rivets in three planes, adding weight to claims that last October's EgyptAir crash was caused by a mechanical malfunction. <p>Announcing the inspections, the federal aviation administration (FAA) said it had no evidence that faulty rivets were implicated in the crash of the EgyptAir Boeing 767, which plunged into the Atlantic, killing 217 people.</p> <p>A crash investigation is under way, but US officials have said they believe the plane was brought down by a suicidal co-pilot, Gamil al-Batouti. Egypt has denied the suggestion, pointing instead to the possibility of a mechanical fault in the tail elevator assembly.</p> <p>The elevators are horizontal flaps which can be moved to control the angle of the plane's nose. They are manipulated by a screw mechanism known as a bellcrank, which is kept in position by shear-rivets. If the system powering the elevators jams, the pilot can break the rivets by applying sufficient force on their controls and manually override the system.</p> <p>In yesterday's advisory note the FAA said: \"Failed shear rivets on two or more bellcrank assemblies could produce abnormal elevator movements and consequent reduced controllability or loss of control.\"</p> <p>The rivets on EgyptAir's elevator system recovered from the ocean had been sheared. US officials suggested that this meant the pilot and Batouti had been pushing on the controls in opposite directions. Cairo argued that the broken rivets suggested they were defective to begin with.</p> <p>Meanwhile, smoke in the passenger cabin caused an American Airlines Boeing 767 en route from London to New York to land in north-eastern Canada yesterday. The airline said the smoke was caused by an electrical problem.</p>",
  "<p>It has not been a good week for Graham Poll. On Monday he was savaged by the Highbury crowd as he sent off Gary McAllister, Patrick Vieira and Dietmar Hamann. On Tuesday he was pilloried by the press. The next day he admitted that he was wrong about sending Hamann off, and yesterday an FA video review panel said that he had got the McAllister decision wrong too. </p> <p>The panel reduced McAllister's punishment to a yellow card and also charged Gilles Grimandi with misconduct after he was shown on television stamping on the Liverpool midfielder. As Poll runs out at Portman Road this afternoon, he could be forgiven for thinking that there is no part of English football that he has not alienated this season. </p> <p>The new FA panels are made up of three officials chosen from a pool of 12 former players and managers who are sent videotapes of incidents. The panel upheld Vieira's sending-off against Sunderland on the opening day of the season and also ordered that charges of misconduct should be brought against Preston North End and Sheffield United for a mass brawl. </p> <p>Although the panels' decisions can be overturned by the FA's disciplinary commission, their existence can only increase the pressure on referees, who already come in for plenty of criticism. A spokesman for the FA said: \"There has always been a right to appeal. The video panels are not designed to undermine referees. The pressure on them is not coming from the FA.\" </p> <p>Many within the game claim that the pressure on referees is self-generated. They say that too many red and yellow cards have been handed out by unreasonable referees who are unable to manage games properly. But referees insist they are doing nothing different this year and that they have been given only one new directive, borrowed from Euro 2000, where the refereeing was considered a success. </p> <p>According to Philip Don, referees officer for the Premier League, it was found that when referees clamp down on offences in the first 15 to 20 minutes it leads to less retaliation from players later in the match, firmly establishes the authority of the referee and allows the game to flow more smoothly. </p> <p>Two games into the new Premiership season and the men in the middle stand accused of doing exactly the opposite. The figures speak for themselves. After two matches in the Premiership last season only four red and 81 yellow cards had been shown, and four penalties and 516 free-kicks had been awarded. This season after two matches there have been eight red cards and 590 free-kicks. However, referees have shown only 72 yellow cards and given four penalties. </p> <p>Don insists that when the 20 Premier League referees met at Lilleshall to discuss the forthcoming season they were told to continue as last season in the way they run their games. Don said: \"Last season we went from a situation of clamping down on a number of areas to leniency, and nothing has changed as far as we are concerned. There is no new clampdown this season. </p> <p>\"We are still refereeing the same way as we were last season. In summing up to the referees at Lilleshall I reiterated that they should carry on as they had the previous season.\" </p> <p>Don denies that the new directive to clamp down early on minor offences is responsible for the increase in sending-offs. \"Our new directive has not led to more red cards. In fact, we told referees at Lilleshall not to caution too early, but obviously if a major offence is committed then ref erees have no option but to apply the letter of the law.\" </p> <p>Many feel, however, given the number of red cards this season, something has changed. Players and managers blame the referees, accusing them of not understanding the game, but Don and his colleagues claim that players and managers are responsible. </p> <p>Don said: \"We are at the beginning of a new season and players are going out there to impress. Squads are bigger, everybody is fighting for their places and they are raring to go. Everybody's got a responsibility. Referees seem to shoulder the blame for everything these days. Managers have a responsibility to control their players and players also have a responsibility.\" </p> <p>Don points to two games this past week as an example of how players can be held responsible for many of the problems. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, at Ipswich against Manchester United, the first free-kick was awarded in the 28th minute and by the end of the match a total of 16 free-kicks had been given. </p> <p>On Monday night, at the controversial Arsenal against Liverpool match, a total of 47 free-kicks were awarded. </p> <p>Don said: \"This has to be down to the attitude of the players. They must also share the blame. Monday night, for example, was a very difficult match. You cannot blame the referee.\" </p> <p><strong>What the rest of the Premiership thinks</strong></p> <p><strong> Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Arsenal manager</strong> </p> <p>\"I will not sit down with referees to discuss these problems. It is not my job to explain to them how to run the game. It is important there is respect on both sides but also that we don't become too friendly because then the pressure would be even greater. I feel there is respect for referees. I believe they try their best and are honest but they always have to try to improve. Some decisions have annoyed me. I feel sometimes I am part of a circus.\" </p> <p><strong> Roy Keane, Manchester United captain</strong> </p> <p>\"Everyone is under a lot of pressure, the players and the referees. To be fair to the refs, a lot of them are willing to hold up their hands after certain games and say: 'Yes, I did make a mistake.' We were criticised for having a go at Andy D'Urso last season and in cases like that, you have to realise the referee is only human and that, like us footballers, they will make mistakes. You have to hope it evens itself out over the season.\" </p> <p><strong> Martin Tyler, </strong></p> <p><strong>Sky Sports senior football commentator</strong> </p> <p>\"Referees are having to operate with one hand tied to their cards. By bringing in mandatory decision-making Fifa has undermined the managerial skills of top referees to deal with individual incidents and matches. Each referee has his own personality and style, but a lot of that has been lost in searching for a perfect world that you will never find. You cannot make 20 people referee the same way.\" </p> <p><strong> Neil Lennon, </strong></p> <p><strong>Leicester City midfielder</strong> </p> <p>\"This is the norm for the start of the season and, once an equilibrium is established between players, managers and referees, it will sort itself out. At the moment refs are a bit too hasty to dish out the bookings rather than having a quiet word. I thought Igor Stimac was unlucky against us at West Ham with the second booking. The ref might have said: \"One more challenge and you're gone.\" If that had been me, I'd have been a bit aggrieved. </p> <p> <strong> The Premiership players sent off so far this season are:<br></strong></p> <p><strong> Charity Shield: Aug 13 </strong> Roy Keane (Man Utd) v Chelsea </p> <p><strong> Premiership:</strong> <strong> Aug 19 </strong> Patrick Vieira (Arsenal) v Sunderland, David Thompson (Coventry) v Middlesbrough <strong> Aug 21 </strong> Vieira (Arsenal) v Liverpool; Gary McAllister, Dietmar Hamann (Liverpool) <strong> Aug 23</strong> Warren Barton (Newcastle) v Derby, Carl Tiler (Charlton) v Everton, Igor Stimac (West Ham v Leicester) </p> <p><strong> Europe: Aug 8</strong> Olivier Dacourt, Eirik Bakke (Leeds) v 1860 Munich</p>",
  "<p>Less than a week into the new Premiership season and English football is giving every appearance of a boiler about to explode. But still the coals of controversy are being fed into the furnace with referees, players, managers and media all stoking away merrily. </p> <p>In the space of five days eight red cards have been flourished, two of them likely to be rescinded, and two more in the direction of Patrick Vieira, the cr\u00e8neme brul\u00e9e of Arsenal's midfield, a player of sweet skills but ever likely to burst into flames. Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger also faces a misconduct charge following an alleged incident with the fourth official after the match at Sunderland last Saturday. </p> <p>Already there is a stand-off between referees determined to crack down and managers angry at seeing their teams depleted. \"Spectators pay to watch a match between 22 players,\" argued Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, after Igor Stimac was dismissed for a second bookable offence against Leicester on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"Some of these referees are prima donnas,\" declared Sir Alex Ferguson after three of his Manchester United players were cautioned for arguing with Jeff Winter at Ipswich the previous evening. Referees might feel entitled to retort that the managerial trade contains a higher density of divas than La Scala Milan and that United have more yap than Battersea dogs home. </p> <p>Clearly the Premier League is in dire need of a thermostat to stop emotions boiling over and spoiling what has otherwise been a highly entertaining start to the season. Those most closely involved - referees, managers and players - need to pause and take stock of a situation which threatens to get out of hand. </p> <p>It does not have to be like this. A glance at an old video tape just before the Premiership kicked off brought to light coverage of a match between Arsenal and Liverpool recorded so long ago that the result had slipped the memory. Certainly the game belonged to another age. </p> <p>The football was fast and competitive but there were no rows or sendings off. There were no foreigners on show either, but the skills of John Barnes and Peter Beardsley for Liverpool and David Rocastle and Paul Merson for Arsenal brightened a dull winter's day. </p> <p>What a contrast to Monday's scenes at Highbury. The referee Graham Poll, who had sent off Gary McAllister and Dietmar Hamann of Liverpool, as well as Vieira, was given a standing vilification extraordinary even by normal standards of crowd abuse. </p> <p>Reporters struggled to make sense of what had been happening while on television Sky's Andy Gray appeared in danger of suffering an apoplectic fit as he insisted that Vieira should not have received a second booking because his two-foot lunge in the direction of Hamann had took the ball instead. </p> <p>Gray is usually right but in this instance he got it wrong since the ugliness of Vieira's tackle was sufficient, under the laws, to warrant punishment whether or not he made contact with an opponent. That is why Poll, while admitting that he should not have booked Hamann a second time, stuck to his guns over the dismissals of both Vieira and McAllister for going in with both feet </p> <p>Yet the latter's red card is likely to be annulled by the Football Association, so it now appears that Liverpool should have been allowed to keep 11 men on the field. Poll, a Fifa referee, cannot be flavour of the month with the FA while his next visit to Anfield should be interesting. </p> <p>Afterwards the French managers of Arsenal and Liverpool, Wenger and G\u00e9rard Houllier respectively, vehemently disputed these sendings-off but what did they expect? Before the start of each season referees, managers and players get together to discuss things that need to be done to make the game a better spectacle. This time it was agreed that a strict line should be taken with two-foot tackles and flailing arms or elbows. </p> <p>Monday's match at Highbury, therefore, could be said to represent an accepted policy put into practice. Except that Poll, who at the start did well in allowing a contest of exceptional pace to swing freely from end to end, came close to losing control because he did not act early enough to cool things down and now appears to have sent two men off in error. </p> <p>That said it is very difficult to spot someone standing on an opponent's hand as Gilles Grimandi, yesterday charged with misconduct by the FA, appeared to do to McAllister. The real referees' assistants should not be the people who used to be called linesmen but the players themselves. </p> <p>The cards and confusion offer a stark and depressing contrast to most of the matches seen during Euro 2000. There referees such as Italy's Pierluigi Collina used their common sense, accepted the inevitability of mistimed but otherwise innocent tackles, and kept their cards in their pockets. </p> <p>The Premiership the players and the refs could probably work things out between themselves. The players should accept decision but referees must concede that not every tackle is perfectly timed. The managers, meanwhile, could best serve football by keeping quiet.</p>",
  "<p>Some people are never satisfied. On the website run by the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association a member recently posted a bitter moan. There had been a problem processing his season ticket, it seems, so he had written to the club to complain and the new chief executive Peter Kenyon had personally rung him to sort things out. And was the lad happy? No he wasn't. Didn't Peter Kenyon realise that as a schoolboy his time was precious? That was the gist of the lad's complaint, and he didn't need some bloke ringing him at home. I am pretty sure he wasn't being ironic. </p> <p>Mind you, it is not hard to understand his cynicism. Good PR and Manchester United are not often linked in the public mind. Arrogance rather than communication has been the order of the day. Huge PR blunders have stumbled out of the club continuously. There was, for instance, the letter sent to season ticket holders stating that the increase in prices was due to the increase in Roy Keane's salary, this in the week that the annual report revealed a profit of over \u00a320m. Then there was the statement warning fans not to travel to Rio for last season's World Club Championship, advice which hugely upset the hosts with the ignorant picture it painted of Brazil as a crime-ridden hell-hole. </p> <p>But all this, the club hope, will change with the appointment of Kenyon in place of Martin Edwards. Kenyon, with his background at the kit manufacturer Umbro, is experienced enough in the real world of business to appreciate that true communication with customers involves more than posting out a mail-order catalogue once a year. </p> <p>Since he took the helm he has been assiduous in trying to change the aloof, greedy image his boardroom has exuded for a decade. He has returned journalists' calls, organised open training sessions and turned up at a meeting organised by an independent fans' group in a Stretford pub. There are also rumours that he is minded to fill a new post of director of communications with one of the supporters who masterminded the successful campaign against Sky's takeover. </p> <p>And this week he announced plans to set up a fans' forum, with voting overseen by the Electoral Reform Society to elect a body designed to articulate supporters' interests. It will report directly to Kenyon himself. </p> <p>\"It's very encouraging,\" says Andy Mitten, editor of the fanzine United We Stand. \"United have been very aloof. Martin Edwards thought building a stadium and a team was all that was required to keep fans happy. But there is a real need to connect and address their concerns: about the atmosphere in the ground, about the way local youngsters are squeezed out by corporate pricing, about ticket distribution. Of course actions speak louder than words and there is a well founded, deep-rooted cynicism among hard-core fans caused by being wholly exploited this past decade. But this is very definitely a start.\" </p> <p>The big question is, since United have been so successful without addressing their match-going supporters' concerns, why should they bother now? After all the fans are not going to switch allegiance and support City, are they? </p> <p>Well, they might. After 10 years of being told to sit down, shut up and anyway they are not as welcome as tourists from Scandinavia, it would be no surprise if many a young Mancunian were drawn to Maine Road. </p> <p>With clubs so high-geared financially, the strategy of ignoring one market while pursuing others is no longer viable. </p> <p>With a hugely extended stadium having to finance hugely inflated wages, not even United can afford to ostracise a single bum that might occupy one of their 67,000 seats. The warning signals were posted when, for the first time since the Premiership started, enough tickets were left over for a game next month to be put on open sale. Kenyon may have been reading the runes.</p>",
  "<p>Sci-fi blockbusters no longer bust blocks like they used to. Despite the futuristic zeitgeist us new-millennium folks are supposed to be surfing, the champion of today's box office is just as likely to be wielding a Roman broadsword as a laser gun. Historical epics are back, and they're more epic than ever. More importantly, they're easier to make than ever. </p> <p>Ever since Jurassic Park, the blockbuster formula has been simple: old idea, new effects. Once the computer-generated image became an industry standard, all you needed to do was salvage a story from the sci-fi scrapheap (take your pick from dinosaurs, alien invaders, meteorites, natural disasters, killer sea creatures), slap on some \"state of the art\" effects, and laugh all the way to the bank. It's worked for the past decade or so, but in recent months, the formula has gone wrong as often as it has gone right. Brian de Palma's $90million space turkey Mission To Mars, for example, was a transparent attempt to feed us Kubrick's 2001 again, and no one bought it. Walter Hill's $70million shambles Supernova suffered a similar fate - aside from the novelty of zero-gravity sex scenes, it was basically Alien again. (At least Hill had the foresight to take his name off the picture, just as the studio had the foresight not to hold any preview screenings.) The forthcoming Pitch Black, while a substantial improvement in the originality stakes, still failed to set the US box office alight. And let's not go into Battlefield Earth. In fact, the most successful and imaginative sci-fi flicks of recent times have been Star Wars Episode I (call that new?), The Matrix (which, tellingly, had snappy new special effects) and Galaxy Quest, a sci-fi spoof. </p> <p>Like spoilt toddlers, audiences need new toys on a regular basis, and the more prescient industry players saw the ugly spectre of sci-fi fatigue rearing its head a long way off. They realised that the way forward was not forward at all. If computer power could be used to create those tired old sci-fi futures, why not use it to re-create the real-world past? Hey presto! Titanic! </p> <p>If former sci-fi diehard James Cameron could score big with a 90-year-old sinking ship, and win an armful of Oscars to boot, what else could be done? Spielberg ditched the dinos and went to war for Saving Private Ryan, and he came out with an Oscar too. French event-movie master Luc Besson tried next, but the tactic didn't quite pay off. His The Fifth Element was one of the best examples of the modern-day effects movie, despite one of the dumbest storylines ever committed to screen (goodies must stop baddies from destroying earth: they do). This year his ambition, and his faith in leading lady Milla Jovovich, got the better of him when he attempted to join the ranks of the \"serious\" directors with his own Gallic-flavoured historical epic, Joan Of Arc. And of course, leading this year's charge, sci-fi great Ridley Scott struck gold by going ancient for Gladiator. </p> <p>Where others had only hinted, Gladiator brazenly demonstrated that full-scale historical epics were viable again - and they hadn't been for more than a decade. The historical epic of yore required a cast of thousands, enormous sets, and pedantic historical accuracy. Big bucks, in other words, which was fine in Cecil B de Mille's day but became increasingly hazardous as time went on. There was so much to get wrong, and when it did go wrong the results were catastrophic. Ask Michael Cimino, who never really recovered from his $35million flop Heaven's Gate, or Hugh Hudson, who took down Goldcrest Films with his Al Pacino-starring 80s effort, Revolution. The failure of that civil war epic prompted critic Leonard Maltin to quip, \"Thanks to this megabomb, it'll be 2776 until we get another one.\" He was out by 776 years. </p> <p>There's no better indication of the turning tide than producer-director team Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. They gleefully rode the wave of sci-fi revamps with the chest-beating Independence Day, then they were forced to eat their slogan - \"size does matter\" - when their hulking entry into the big reptile market, Godzilla, came crashing to the ground (size doesn't matter, you fools, effects do). </p> <p>This year they scored big again by switching to the historical formula. No doubt encouraged by the knee-jerk patriotism which made Independence Day so popular in the States, they decided to simply make it again, this time based on the real independence day. Hence the Mel Gibson-starring civil war epic, The Patriot. Like the rest of the sci-fi defectors, Devlin and Emmerich recognised that computer animation has eliminated the risks which scuppered \"old-fashioned\" historical epics, and the two genres have become interchangeable. So why \"kick ET's butt\" when you can kick a child-murdering Limey's butt (with historical justification)? Why blow up an alien spaceship when you can blow up an 18th-century battleship just as easily? Why hire 1,500 extras for a battle scene when you can just dress up 50 and fill in the rest with a computer? Costs down, profits up, audiences happy. You might even win an Oscar. </p> <p>This week we're back in the Colosseum for another lavish sandal-fest, Julie Taymor's Shakespeare adaptation Titus. Although much of the production gloss is real rather than computer-rendered (the director was responsible for the stage version of The Lion King, after all), many of the same themes that made Gladiator so popular are present - power struggles and revenge tactics in ancient Rome, bloody combat with primitive weaponry, grand interiors and costumes, emperors with eye-shadow. Although its application is more subtle, computer rendering is still widely deployed: for the multi-layered dream sequences; for the plot's intermittent dismemberments (so difficult to achieve with the conventional long sleeves and false stumps); and for adding a Matrix-style, bullet-time zip to the climax. </p> <p>Titus is a particularly distinguished example of how the historical epic can be resurrected (ie with some restraint and intelligence), but the studio bean-counters are currently throwing millions of dollars at a new (computer) generation of these movies. The related world of swords-and-sorcery epics is due to come into play again soon, with game cash-in Dungeons And Dragons and Peter Jackson's hugely ambitious Lord Of The Rings trilogy in production (he's apparently using the whole of New Zealand as the set). In real history, there's Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer's second world war epic Pearl Harbor on the horizon, with Ben Affleck, Alec Baldwin and Kate Beckinsale among others, which already has the dubious distinction of being the most expensive movie since Titanic. </p> <p>If the historical craze continues, aside from making intellectually challenged movie moguls even more money, what will be the consequences for history? Perhaps movies will distort it beyond all resemblance to factual reality - after all, that's what movies do best. People will assume that all Romans had fringes and spoke English (some with Australian accents), that the British are the sole cause of evil and injustice in the world, that slaves enjoyed being classified as property and that the second world war was won single-handedly by the Americans (who defeated the British, of course). Perhaps they'll even forget that people used to make movies about spaceships and dinosaurs. Then we can start all over again. </p> <p>\u0095 Titus is out on Friday</p>",

With an artfully simple folk-tale style familiar from Riddley Walker and Turtle Diary, Hoban creates a mythology from ancient and modern parts. The elemental prose is livened by flashes of humour, but beware of reading too much into this childlike narrative. </p> <p> <strong> Big Trouble</strong><br>Dave Barry <br>(Piatkus \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502452726,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Mr Barry has some influential friends, whose extravagant back-cover praise raises expectations. \"The funniest book I've read in fifty years,\" gushes Elmore Leonard. \"I laughed so hard I fell out of a chair,\" puffs Stephen King. I didn't. Big Trouble is a slapstick, gun-toting farce in which a cross-section of Miami society gets caught up in a high-school game of \"Killer\" and a real contract is taken out on a drunken gambler. Barry lines up the usual suspects - dopey teens, middle-aged jerks and sleazy crooks - for a pantomine Fargo with palm-trees.

Sitting out on their stoep among the ruins of dismantled fridges, they cling to the belief that they are God's children, the white minority chosen to rule the kaffirs.

John Drean has returned to the northern seaside town of his childhood where everybody knows about, but no one speaks of, his daughter, who is missing presumed dead. Neither his sister or his father can get through to him, but one night he sees a young woman clutching a child and finds that she is a fellow pyromaniac. Blanchard creates a fragmentary picture of the snooker halls and daytime pubs that people troubled by the rhythms of ordinary life inhabit. The Paraffin Child is an uneasy yet powerful portrayal of a man whose connections to ordinary life have been severed.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Richard Branson's attempts to run the national lottery were stalled yesterday pending a legal challenge by Camelot, the current operator. </p> <p>At the high court, Mr Justice Sullivan ruled that negotiations between Sir Richard's People's Lottery and the regulator should be halted over the bank holiday weekend and not restart until Tuesday. </p> <p>The court will then consider Camelot's application for a judicial review of the regulator's decision to hold talks solely with Sir Richard. On Wednesday, the national lottery commission gave the People's Lottery a month to resubmit its bid while rejecting Camelot's bid out of hand. </p> <p>Sir Richard, who held \"constructive\" talks with the commission before the court ruling yesterday, condemned Camelot's decision to go to law. \"It could delay the setting up of the People's Lottery and potentially deprive good causes of hundreds of millions of pounds,\" Sir Richard said. </p> <p>Camelot faces a difficult 12 months before its licence runs out. The operator went to great lengths last night to insist that it had \"no quarrel\" with the People's Lottery consortium. </p> <p>Dianne Thompson, chief executive designate of Camelot, said the decision to take legal action came after a direct plea to the lottery commission went unheeded. </p> <p>Mr Justice Sullivan said the pledge by the lottery commission not to negotiate with Sir Richard over the long weekend \"meets the fairness of the case\". </p> <p>The regulator threw out Camelot's bid after its reputation was tarnished by connections with GTech, the US company that supplies much of its software, and after it was found to have covered up problems with its software.</p>",
  "<p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, has agreed to delay new rules governing the right of employers to monitor their employees' personal emails in the face of widespread criticism of the legislation by business leaders. </p> <p>Ministers had previously insisted that the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which will govern all email and telephone surveillance, must be in place before the Human Rights Act comes into force on October 2. </p> <p>The proposed regulations require all public authorities and private companies to get the consent of both the sender and the receiver of emails, voice mails and other messages before they conduct any monitoring, with only a handful of specific exceptions. </p> <p>However, business groups have warned that these constraints on business monitoring of emails could leave firms vulnerable to legal action by employees claiming their right to privacy had been breached. This in turn could force firms to avoid such risks by banning their staff from sending any personal emails. </p> <p>The existing rules for in-house company surveillance have already been successfully challenged in the European Court of Human Rights. </p> <p>Ministers hope the new law will avoid a spate of similar challenges against government departments and other public sector employers under the new human rights legislation. </p> <p>Although the business surveillance law has already received royal assent, the Department of Trade and Industry has agreed to extend the consultation period on the proposed surveillance rules, which had been due to end yesterday, by a further three weeks following criticism from businesss organisations. </p> <p>The rules will now come into force on October 24, when an EU directive concerning email privacy also comes into force. </p> <p>Yesterday the Alliance for Electronic Business (AEB), which includes the Confederation of British Industry, issued a response to the DTI's consultation paper condemning the rules as \"totally impractical and indeed impossible\" to comply with. </p> <p>The AEB called on the government to introduce entirely new rules which would allow companies the right to blanket monitor all employees without consent, except in \"specifically excluded\" cases. </p> <p>This proposal was condemned by the Trade Unions Congress and civil liberty campaigners as \"completely unacceptable\". </p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office said public sector employers, who have a direct duty to abide by the Human Rights Act, had already been advised of the risk of a human rights challenge.</p>",
  "Surgeons were yesterday given the go-ahead to separate Siamese twin girls against the wishes of their parents and though the operation is bound to cause the death of the weaker child. <p>In the first case of its kind in Britain, a high court judge decided it was right that the 12-hour operation be carried out despite the parents' wish that nature should take its course. </p> <p>The parents were brought to England for the birth from a \"remote\" community in an unidentified European country which lacked sophisticated medical facilities. </p> <p>Jodie and Mary - false names used by the judge to preserve their anonymity - were born joined at the lower abdomen on August 8 at St Mary's hospital in Manchester. </p> <p>Doctors believe that if the twins are separated Jodie will have a good chance of a normal life while Mary, who relies on her twin for her blood supply, will die. Without an operation, it is thought both girls would perish within six months because of the extra strain being imposed on Jodie's heart and lungs. </p> <p>Though the parents believed that morally the operation should not take place, Central Manchester healthcare trust appealed to the court for permission to go ahead with the procedure. </p> <p>Jodie is described in the court ruling as a \"bright and alert baby, sparkling, sucking on her dummy, moving her arms as babies do...very much a with-it sort of baby.\" If separated, doctors believe she would be able to walk unaided, probably attend school and have children. </p> <p>Mary's state, however, is \"pitiable\". Her face is deformed and she has no effective heart or lung function and she probably has brain damage. Her sister is effectively her life support machine. When lightly touched or stroked, her face contorts and, when pinched, she reacts but cannot cry out in pain because she does not have the lungs. As Jodie moved, tried to crawl or turned over in her sleep, there was the \"horrendous scenario\" of Mary being dragged around behind her\". </p> <p>Mr Justice Johnson, giving his ruling in public after a two-day private hearing, said: \"For Jodie, separation means the expectation of a normal life; for Mary it means death. Little wonder that the parents are overwhelmed by the circumstances that confront them. </p> <p>\"Instead of the joy and the longed-for happiness of children, they are faced with a decision from which any parent would shrink. They love, love dearly, both their children but they love them equally and simply cannot bring themselves to choose life for one at this frightful cost to the other.\" </p> <p>The parent's background further complicated the quandary. The customs of their community meant that the religious couple believed they were being punished for previous sins and it was \"unthinkable\" that the twins could be taken home. </p> <p>During the hearing, the father broke down as he tried to give evidence but the judge quoted at length from the parents' emotional written testimony. The parents expressed concern that if Jodie was left seriously disabled, they would not be able to look after her properly in their country because of their lack of money and the poor standard of health care. They argued that they might have to leave her in England - a move which would break their hearts. </p> <p>Mr Justice Johnson said he had \"attached great weight\" to the wishes of the parents but he added that the interests of a child were \"paramount\". </p> <p>He also emphasised that the court would never authorise a step to \"actively\" terminate a life, even to relieve misery. However, it is lawful for treatment to be withdrawn, even if this leads to death. </p> <p>The judge said: \"I conclude that the few months of Mary's life, if not separated from her twin, would not simply be worth nothing to her, they would be hurtful. To prolong Mary's life...would...be very seriously to her disadvantage.\" </p> <p>Giving clearance for the operation, he said he based his decision on the twins' case on the view that what will cause Mary's death is the \"interruption or withdrawal\" of the blood supply from Jodie, comparing this to a doctor withholding food or drink. </p> <p>The parents and the Official Solicitor, acting on behalf of Mary, are understood to be preparing to appeal against the decision next week. Siamese twins develop when a fertilised egg which is set to divide into identical twins fails to split. The result is that two embryos are joined together. The phenomenon occurs once in 50,000 to 100,000 births. </p> <p>Great Ormond Street children's hospital, London, is one of the centres which has had success separating Siamese twins. Since 1984, 16 sets have been treated there. Twelve children, including four sets of twins, survive. </p> <p>There have been some high-profile cases. Aiofe and Niamh McDonnell were born in June 1997 sharing a liver. They were separated in a seven-hour operation and are living a healthy life in Ireland. </p> <p><b>'We have faith in God to decide our daughters' fate'</b></p> <p>This is an extract from the written testimony of the twins' parents to the high court. The name of the parents' home country is replaced with (in our community). </p> <p> \"We cannot begin to accept or contemplate that one of our children should die to enable the other one to survive. That is not God's will. Everyone has the right to life so why should we kill one of our daughters to enable the other one to survive. That is not what we want and that is what we have told the doctors treating Jodie and Mary. In addition, we are also told that if Jodie survives, and that is not known at all, then she is going to be left with serious disabilities. The life we have (in our remote community) with very few, if any, facilities would make it extremely difficult not only for us to cope with a disabled child but for that disabled child to have any sort of life. </p> <p>There is a small hospital but they do not have the staff or facilities to cope with someone with serious ongoing disabilities ... We know our babies are in a very poor condition, we know that the doctors are trying to do their very best for each of them. We have very strong feelings that neither of our children should receive any medical treatment. </p> <p>We certainly do not want separation surgery to go ahead as we know and have been told very clearly that it will result in the death of our daughter Mary. We cannot possibly agree to any surgery being undertaken that will kill one of our daughters. We have faith in God and we are quite happy for God's will to decide what happens to our two young daughters. In addition, we cannot see how we can possibly cope either financially or personally with a child who will have serious disabilities. </p> <p>We know there is no guarantee of survival but she is the stronger of the two twins and if she should survive any surgery then we have to be realistic and look at what we as parents can offer to our daughter and what care and facilities are available to her in our homeland. They are virtually nil...This has meant we have also had to give very careful consideration to leaving Jodie in England should she survive to be looked after by other people. We do not know if other people would be willing to look after such a seriously disabled child but we do know that this is something that, if we had any other choice, we would not give it consideration. </p> <p>We do not know if it is possible or feasible for her to be fostered by another family so we can have an involvement in her upkeeping or whether she would have to be adopted and we would have no contact with her at all. That would break our hearts.\"</p> <p>Conjoined Twins - Pro-Life Views: <a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com/</a></p>",
  "\"The defeat of Mr Cook and Mr Byers is... to be lamented\" (Leaders, August 23). What an understatement! Far from just being lamented, it makes our government a laughing stock over control of arms' sales. The year before Labour came into office the man who was later appointed Labour's foreign secretary made a statement making absolutely clear the opposition's views on the Scott report on the arms trade. For three years the government has prevaricated and now it is sliding out of any commitment to implement the recommendations of the Scott report. Such behaviour, especially on the arms trade issue, is a matter that concerns many Labour supporters and is a serious vote loser. <br> <b>Lady Moser</b> <br> London",
  "The International Match Safe Association sounds as if it could be anything from a body to look at the control of football hooliganism to a secret society aimed at aligning codes for security vaults around the world. <p>In fact it is a group of people, mostly Americans, who collect matchboxes. Or rather, they are collectors of Vesta cases, the Victorian prototype of the matchbox, which are known as match safes in the US. </p> <p>In September the association is holding its annual meeting in London, the first time it has done so. There will be about 100 delegates. Ever alive to a good marketing opportunity, Christie's, South Kensington is holding a dedicated sale of Vesta cases. </p> <p>Vesta cases grew out of the tradition of snuffboxes or enamel patch boxes, which became popular from the 18th-century onwards. Ornate enamel boxes were made by applying one or more layers of a vitreous substance, usually on a base of copper. </p> <p>The Vesta box came in during the 19th-century after the discovery of the match. It was a great breakthrough because it obviated the need to keep a constant fire in the hearth to provide a flame. </p> <p>Several countries lay claim to have invented the match, but the strongest case has been made for John Walker of Stockton-on-Tees in the UK. His experiments in 1826 led to the first friction match. Its tip was a composite of potassium chloride and sulphur antimony, which struck when placed between rough surfaces like sandpaper. </p> <p>The matches were sold in batches of 100 for a shilling, with an extra two pence being for the tin box container. This was very important because these early matches could easily ignite accidentally if not stored carefully. They were also a health hazard to match workers, giving rise to the degeneration of facial and bone tissue. </p> <p>To avoid Victorian gentlemen catching alight in the street, the safety match was developed. This involved the separation of chemicals between match head and the sandpaper used for striking. </p> <p>But the attraction of having a decorative case in which to hold the matches remained and grew stronger throughout the late 19th-century and into the 20th-century. These early Vesta cases were at first relatively simple affairs. But as time went on, they became more sophisticated enamelled cases on a silver or sometimes gold base. </p> <p>The highlights of the Christie's auction are a colourful scene depicting the Changing of the Guard outside Buckingham Palace gates. This is a silver Sampson Mordan and is estimated to fetch \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200. A silver HMV Vesta case of Nipper the dog standing beside a gramophone is expected to realise \u00a3500 to \u00a3600. A third Vesta is shaped as a gun. The matches are placed in the barrel while the top also acts as a cigar cutter (estimated at \u00a3600 to \u00a3800). </p> <p>But these are estimates; the point about Vestas is that they are becoming increasingly rare. Jeff Lovell, the specialist at Christie's, says: \"We started stand-alone sales two years ago because some collections came our way. This sale, which has 144 lots, is the last of the collections plus other bits and pieces.\" </p> <p>There are many different scenes on Vestas, from hunting pictures to sentry boxes to birds and country vistas. Prices start at \u00a3200, but they could reach thousands. </p> <p>For more details: Christie's South Kensington, tel: 020-7581-7611</p>",
  "This week flat owners around the country sighed with relief as the government signalled an end to the reign of nightmare landlords with the publication of its proposals for residential leasehold reform. <p>The long-awaited draft Commonhold-Leasehold Reform Bill is light at the end of the tunnel for nearly 2m flat and house leaseholders in England and Wales, many held to ransom by unscrupulous freeholders charging sky-high maintenance charges. But critics say the proposals to increase leaseholders' rights and introduce a new form of flat ownership, called commonhold, don't go far enough. </p> <p>In the consultation document, the government proposes a new right for leaseholders to take over the management of their building without having to prove landlords' shortcomings and without paying them compensation. </p> <p>The move does not replace existing leaseholders' rights to buy the freehold, but is an alternative for those dissatisfied with the management of the building and either don't want, or can't afford, to fork out for the freehold. </p> <p>Leaseholders who do want to force the landlord to sell them the freehold, a process known as collective enfranchisement, will find it easier under the proposals, which aim to simplify how freeholders are compensated. </p> <p>Leaseholders will have a greater say on the vexed question of service charges. Other improvements include changes to accounting procedures to discourage fraud. </p> <p>Campaigners were hoping ministers would get rid of leasehold for good. However, the draft bill stops short of removing the status. Instead, it introduces a new form of tenure, commonhold, where flat owners have an interest in their flat or \"unit\" and an interest in a commonhold association which owns the shared parts, such as hallways. </p> <p>Flat owners will be able to convert to commonhold, but only if all interested parties, including the freeholder, agree. Applicants must satisfy HM Land Registry that consent was given freely. </p> <p>The fact that newly built properties will not automatically be registered as commonhold proves the government has ducked the issue, says Ken Murray of the Coalition for the Abolition of Residential Leasehold (Carl). Instead, owners of new flats will have to go through the same process as others to convert to commonhold. </p> <p>Mr Murray says Carl is also angry that the government is sticking with the device known as the marriage value, the term for the compensation made to the freeholder if he or she is forced to sell to the leaseholders. </p> <p>Disputes over the marriage value have slowed down attempts at collective enfranchisement in the past. Some flat owners have given up when unwilling freeholders have used the process to stall the sale. </p> <p>The marriage value is the amount the leasehold and freehold would be worth if they were sold together on the open market. The draft bill proposes that the marriage value is split half-and-half between leaseholders and landlord. Mr Murray wanted to see it abolished altogether. </p> <p>About 200,000 leaseholders in England have a local authority or housing association as their freeholder. Many bought flats from their landlord under the right-to-buy initiative of the 80s. Since then a growing number have changed hands. </p> <p>According to the government, about a third of the group are second owners who bought their ex-council flat on the open market. Buildings that started life as council housing, such as architect Erno Goldfinger's Trellick Tower in Hammersmith, London are now inhabited by a mix of council and private owners. </p> <p>But many, particularly the system-built estates of the 60s, are expensive to maintain. And leaseholders are often unhappy with the service they receive from their landlord, particularly when it comes to charges for maintaining the building and common parts. For their part, many social landlords are unwilling freeholders, uncomfortable with the role - they were forced to sell properties to former tenants by law. </p> <p>The government has decided that leaseholders with social landlords need the same protection as those in the private sector. Announcing the publication of the draft Bill, housing minister Nick Raynsford said all leaseholders have a right to be consulted about the works they'll be expected to pay for and an opportunity to challenge works or costs they consider unreasonable. </p> <p>Leaseholders already have the right to be consulted about major works. The government proposes extending this right to include improvements to the property. Leaseholders will also be able to challenge the reasonableness of the work or its cost at a Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. Leaseholders who fall out with freeholders or suspect they are being ripped off can turn to Lease, an independent agency that provides free legal advice to leaseholders, landlords and others. </p> <p>Residential leasehold reform is a slow process. The government says it now wants to test proposals out. Interested parties have the chance to comment on the proposals and draft bill before October. </p> <p>But Mr Murray says Carl will take this opportunity to try and persuade ministers to remove leasehold status from the statute books altogether.</p>",
  "For many of us, the sound of Test Match Special on Radio 4 signals the beginning of summer, bringing memories of the Hampshire burr of John Arlott and the chocolate cakes and wit of Brian Johnston, alas no longer with us. <p>But what's this as we tune in for our daily fix? The sweet voice of a young woman, a Caribbean one at that. And she's good. Donna Symmonds, for it is she, is very good. Will the old fogies believe it? Only a year after the barriers on women becoming members of the MCC came down comes a breakthrough in the commentary box. </p> <p>This feisty young lawyer from Barbados has made herself comfortable in a role she could scarcely have foreseen growing up in Bridgetown. Ms Symmonds went to an all-girls secondary school and was, she says, \"sporty\". She also admits she was lippy. \"My nickname at school was Fidel. I was outspoken on any subject, in fact every thing.\" Her father Algernon, at one time a High Commissioner for Barbados in London, fostered a love of cricket in his daughter and did a bit of commentating himself. </p> <p>Her aunt suggested she go to her alma mater, Reading University in England, to read science. Ms Symmonds says: \"I hated everything about it. I didn't like the food, I didn't like the weather and I was terribly homesick - so I went home. I had wonderful parents and I travelled extensively. Hence, I've got an open mind.\" </p> <p>Then came the turnaround. A friend at Reading told her: \"You talk a lot. Why don't you try to become a lawyer?\" </p> <p>\"In those years,\" she says, \"I went to a lot of cricket and tennis matches, but I didn't neglect my studies. Cricket was in my blood. My father's friends included Sir Frank Worrel; Sir Gary Sobers and Clive Lloyd were regular visitors.\" </p> <p>In l985 she was accepted to the bar at the Council of Legal Education, Chancery Lane, London. The daughter of a Bridgetown partner in a legal firm introduced Ms Symmonds to her father and she was taken into his chambers. Two years later she was ready to open her own firm and currently defends clients on a range of crimes. </p> <p>Her big break into sports came almost by accident. Another childhood friend, Sharon Jones, who was a producer on the local sports station, needed a tennis commentator badly. At very short notice she turned to her friend Donna and begged her to help her out of a tight spot. \"I was hesitant,\" Ms Symmonds admits, \"But although tennis is the hardest commentary to do, the $100 she offered convinced me.\" </p> <p>Her successful debut brought overtures from the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation to persuade her to try her hand at cricket. \"I had enjoyed myself, so I said 'why not?' I wound up doing Test cricket in the West Indies,\" she says. There was a mixed reaction from listeners. \"Back in the West Indies,\" she says, \"Some people were saying 'this can't be right' when they heard my voice. Some of them thought I was reading from cue cards. Only 20% of listeners supported me but that has now risen to 85-90%. It has moved from 'she doesn't know cricket' to 'okay she knows cricket but'...\" </p> <p>Then the Beeb came knocking. In 1998 the Test Match Special team was covering the Tests in the Caribbean. Jonathan Agnew and Vic Marks were sitting in on local radio between stints, got to know Donna and suggested she try out for Test Match Special (TMS). </p> <p>She was hired by long-time TMS producer Peter Baxter. He didn't have to blow any trumpets because he recognized she was good and she had plenty of experience. </p> <p>Her cricketing background is reflected in her impressive commentary style. She insists she is not a summariser. She doesn't struggle to interpret the intricacies of the game. She is calm, seeing parallels between standing up before a judge and talking into a microphone. </p> <p>\"In both instances you are forced to think on your feet. You try to maintain a lawyer's objectivity,\" she says. \"With the new technology, I am able to combine both careers. I can juggle cricket, tennis and the law. Email allows me to be in constant and instant contact with my law office. I have now created a partnership back home that allows the best of both worlds.\" </p> <p>So here's what you do. When the Test Match is on television next weekend, turn down the sound, put on the good old wireless and listen to the sounds of summer with a Bajan lilt.</p>",

  "When her marriage ended, Samantha Stone destroyed her copy of a video of her enjoying group sex. Her estranged husband kept his copy, and yesterday Julian St Quinton, 33, a butcher from Easington, East Yorkshire, was found guilty of blackmail with menaces. <p>Details of the couple's sex life unfolded at Hull crown court. They had enjoyed group sex on at least eight occasions with a couple met through a contact magazine. Once, they were joined by another man. She also posed with a woman for pictures that her husband sent to the readers' wives section of Escort magazine. </p> <p>After the verdict, Judge Tom Cracknell said blackmail usually meant jail; he adjourned sentence to a later date. </p> <p>St Quinton denied the charge and told the court that he kept the video, a seven-hour compilation, to remind him of \"an enjoyable time in his life\", but the jurors found he had used it to make Ms Stone, 26, give up her claim to half of their \u00a3100,000 home. </p> <p>In an acrimonious divorce, he threatened to send the tape to her parents, Linda and Trevor Stone, and to the colleagues of her father, millionaire owner of a timber firm. </p> <p>At one point in the five-day trial St Quinton alleged Linda Stone had been keen on him and had performed a sex act on him in her kitchen - a claim that her daughter dismissed. </p> <p>Ms Stone, a secretary from Roos near Hull, said her husband phoned her threatening to release the video. She went to police after an anonymous call from a woman who said: \"Get your solicitors to back off. I know what he's got. I have seen the video.\" </p> <p>She wept as she told the court she now viewed the group sex with revulsion, although at the time she had agreed; when she drank a lot of alcohol, she lost her inhibitions. \"He never held a gun to my head. I knew what I was doing. I did it to keep him happy. I craved love from him, but he didn't show me any.\" </p> <p>They had met when she was 16. Within two years of getting married in 1993 he suggested they have group sex, which he often filmed. They separated in 1997, and she later moved in with another man. </p> <p>St Quinton admitted showing the video to two girlfriends and to his brothers, but his defence lawyer described him as a fool and braggart who had showed off the video only to regain a status he thought he had lost when his wife left him. He was visibly shaken at the jury's verdict. </p> <p>In a statement outside court, Mr and Mrs Stone said they were delighted with the verdict: \"Our love for each other has never been stronger, and we utterly refute [sic] Julian St Quinton's allegations.\" </p> <p>Residents of Easington, a hamlet with three pubs and a 12th century church, were shocked to hear what had been going on.

  "New rights are to be given to babies conceived after their father's death to prevent a repeat of the Diane Blood case. <p>Mrs Blood had to go abroad to obtain fertility treatment using her dead husband Stephen's sperm. In 1998 she gave birth to a son, Liam, but was unable to register her husband's name on the birth certificate because he was not alive at the time of conception. </p> <p>The 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act states that when a child is conceived posthumously it is legally fatherless and should be registered as such. But after the birth of Liam Blood, a government review was set up headed by Sheila McLean, professor of law and ethics in medicine at Glasgow University, to examine the issue of posthumous conceptions. </p> <p>Mrs Blood, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, said yesterday that she was pleased by the government's proposals to change the act. \"It is very important for these children and their mothers because it means that the biological facts will be recorded as they truly are,\" she said. \"Until now mothers have effectively had to lie when asked whether they knew the father of their child.\" </p> <p>If the proposals become law, Mrs Blood will now be allowed retroactive permission to re-register her son's birth and put her husband's name on the birth certificate. </p> <p>But she was disappointed that the government had refused to make legal the use of sperm or eggs taken from a spouse without their consent. </p> <p>Mrs Blood was unable to seek consent to remove sperm from her husband Stephen in 1994 because he was in a coma after becoming ill with meningitis. </p> <p>After a long legal battle, she convinced the appeal court that she should be allowed to receive fertility treatment in Belgium using her husband's sperm. </p> <p>The number of posthumous conceptions has increased in Britain in recent years, putting pressure on ministers to change the law or offer more guidance. At least six such babies were born last year. </p> <p>However, the government has refused to extend inheritance or succession rights to the children and will insist that the father's name is followed by the word deceased. </p> <p>Marian Jordan, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, has been campaigning to register her late husband as the father of her son Daniel ever since the child's birth last October. Her husband, David, was diagnosed with cancer three years ago and some of his sperm was frozen before he died. </p> <p>She said it was one of the last things she could do for her husband to have his name on his son's birth certificate. </p> <p>Announcing the changes, Yvette Cooper, the minister for public health, said: \"These proposals will build on an existing law to form a sensible and balanced framework governing what will always be difficult and emotional circumstances. The government rarely proposes that legislation should be retrospective, but in the unusual case where families are unable to put the father's name on the birth certificate where his sperm has been used after death, this is exactly the right thing to do. These children should have the right to have their father's name registered on their birth certificate.\" </p> <p>The government will leave unchanged the common law provisions which require a person's consent before his or her gametes (sperm or eggs) are removed, under most circumstances. When a person is incapacitated and unable to give their consent but they are likely to recover and their fertility is likely to be affected, then gametes may be removed in their best interests.</p>",
  "The Zimbabwean government designated another 509 mostly white-owned farms for seizure yesterday as part of its fast track programme to redistribute land to poor black farmers. <p>Its plan to take over up to 65% of the country's commercial farms before the rainy season begins in November is likely to damage the already battered economy. </p> <p>So far about 1,500 farms have been earmarked for confiscation. In the next few weeks the government is expected to designate a total of 3,000 farms. More than 200 have already been seized under the land acquisition law enacted by decree earlier this year. </p> <p>President Robert Mugabe's cash-strapped government does not have the funds to redevelop properties for small-scale farming, so thousands of black families will be dropped on the land and left to cultivate it as best they can. </p> <p>The accelerated resettlement programme has also been criticised because of the politically partisan way in which it is being carried out. Officials of the government party, Zanu-PF, have chosen the farms to be seized and are allocating them on the basis of loyalty to the party. Many have been won by picking lots out of a hat. </p> <p>Agriculture now in disarray, for the commercial banks have refused to lend to white farmers because of the unrest. This will halt most agricultural production before the evictions actually take place. </p> <p>\"Some of our most productive farms, that are the envy of the rest of Africa, will become peasant plots farmed on a subsistence basis,\" John Robertson, a Harare economist, said. </p> <p>\u0095At least 1,000 Zimbabwean white farmers have inquired about migration to Zambia but financial problems are ruling out a mass exodus: only 40 have gone since April.

  "Abulfaz Elchibey, who has died of prostate cancer in Ankara at the age of 62, led the first movement for democratic reform and independence in Soviet Azerbaijan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he became the newly independent country's president. <p>An Arab philologist by training and a university professor, he was part of the generation of former dissidents who rose to supreme power in all three Caucasian republics, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. But he lacked the skills and contacts to maintain his grip when the old authoritarian nomenklatura worked their way back. </p> <p>Elchibey was head of the Azerbaijani Popular Front when, in an almost forgotten episode, Mikhail Gorbachev launched what turned out to be the bloodiest action of his six years in the Kremlin. In January 1990, the Popular Front mounted a series of mass street protests against the ruling Azerbaijani Communist party. With barricades springing up all over Baku, the Kremlin sent in tanks to crush a rebellion, leaving more than 130 people dead. </p> <p>A much smaller action by pro-Soviet hardliners against nationalists in Lithuania a year later - not supported by Gorbachev - received more sympathy and publicity in the west. Partly it was because the Baltic republics were European. But the lack of interest was also prompted by the fact that, a week before the Soviet tanks were sent into Baku, scores of Armenians in the city were murdered in a pogrom of killing, looting, and burning. Thousands fled to Armenia in terror. </p> <p>The KGB was rumoured to have been behind the murders, but, in the chaos of the time, no investigation was possible. Thousands of Azerbaijani refugees from the disputed territory of Nagorno- Karabkah had recently settled in shacks on the outskirts of Baku, and it was easy to fan hatred and revenge. Whoever lit the match, it was the Popular Front's foreign image that suffered from the killings of Armenians, and the crackdown aroused no international protest. </p> <p>When the republic held its first presidential elections, a month after proclaiming independence in August 1991, Elchibey came second to a pro-Communist doctor, Ayaz Mutalibov. Nine months later, the Popular Front made a new stab at power, and, after armed clashes in the streets of Baku, Mutalibov fled the presidential palace. Elchibey was elected president in June 1992. </p> <p>The republic's unexpected independence set off a struggle among local elites for control of its rich oil resources. Old regional and clan rivalries re-emerged. A further cause of tension was the proxy war with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armed by the powerful diaspora, Armenian forces gradually seized control and drove out the rest of the Azeri population, in an ethnic conflict that left 15,000 dead. Azerbaijan's defeat opened the way for new challenges to Elchibey. He found himself unable to motivate the security forces' support when Surat Huseinov, a millionaire businessman from Azerbaijan's second city of Gyandzha, marched on the capital. </p> <p>Elchibey fled to his native region of Nakichevan, calling on the old Brezhnev-era communist boss, Geidar Aliyev, to take over temporarily in his stead. This was political suicide; Aliyev bought Huseinov off with the offer of the prime ministership and organised new elections - which he easily won. The move was justified as preventing civil war. </p> <p>Elchibey remained in internal exile. He was allowed back to Baku in 1997, and, as chairman of the new movement for electoral reform, was regaining some popularity when he was taken ill. A secular moderniser and advocate of reviving Azerbaijan's links with Turkey, during his time as president he had changed the alphabet from Cyrillic and obtained the closure of all Russian bases. </p> <p>Born at Keleki, in Nakichevan, he studied Arabic and became a university teacher. He was arrested in January 1975 as an Azeri nationalist, and served 18 months in a labour camp. On release, he worked for the Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences before founding the Popular Front in 1989. </p> <p>He leaves a wife and two children. </p> <p>\u0095 Abulfaz Elchibey, politician, born June 7 1938; died August 22 2000</p>",
  "Four Channel 4 journalists charged with espionage in Liberia were released from prison yesterday after a week of international protests and a personal apology from the men and the chairman of the television company to Liberian president Charles Taylor. <p>The four men, who were making a three-part documentary, were detained last Friday and charged on Monday with helping British and US intelligence to support allegations that Liberia was assisting rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone by diamond smuggling and gun running. </p> <p>Interviewed on CNN, Mr Taylor said their release was the result of \"plea bargaining\" between government lawyers and defence counsel. </p> <p>\"We are not expelling the journalists but they are free to leave whenever they want,\" he said. </p> <p>The journalists - British director David Barrie, Zimbabwe-born cameraman Tim Lambon, who has dual South African and British nationality, Sorious Samura from Sierra Leone, and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were expected to fly out of the capital Monrovia to Abidjan on the Ivory Coast. Under the Liberian penal code they could have faced 10 years in prison or, according to the indictment, the death penalty. </p> <p>Their release was welcomed by the foreign secretary Robin Cook as \"an enormous relief for the men's families\". </p> <p>Mr Cook said that he would be thanking President Ob-asanjo of Nigeria; Nelson Mandela; Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's envoy to Africa; and the Sierra Leone ambassador to Liberia for their efforts. </p> <p>The Liberian authorities released the men's statement which read: \"We, the four journalists currently held in Monrovia central prison, wish to express our unreserved apology to both his excellency the president of Liberia and the people of Liberia for any offence which our actions or statements have caused.\" </p> <p>The letter to Mr Taylor from Channel 4 chairman Vanni Treves, which is not being released, reinforced that message. </p> <p>Mr Taylor told CNN that the charges against the men stemmed from a script seized from them at the time of their arrest at their Monrovia hotel. He said the journalists appeared to have decided on their story before arriving in Liberia and to have come to the country to \"fill in the blanks\". </p> <p>\"This was not a check to the free press. We were dealing with a case of conspiracy with a clear case of libel here, which would have damaged this country. </p> <p>\"I am very thankful to Almighty God that they have realised that an error has been made and that Channel 4 in Britain have issued a statement of remorse, because they did something terrible here.\" </p> <p>Mr Taylor, a former warlord in the Liberian civil war, has repeatedly denied allegations that he was colluding with his allies across the border, the rebel Revolutionary United Front which controls Sierra Leone's diamond areas. He again demanded proof yesterday, even though the evidence is far from circumstantial. </p> <p>British and American officials have claimed to have information from photographs and satellite surveillance of arms being trucked across the border to the rebels as well as intelligence of meetings between rebel leaders and Mr Taylor. </p> <p>It is estimated that last year Liberia, with an annual diamond production worth about $10m (\u00a36.8m), exported stones to the value of $300m. A senior Swiss customs official confirmed two weeks ago that Liberian imports had surged from nothing in 1997 to $29.7m in the first half of this year. Last month a senior director of De Beers, the main diamond buyer, told a conference in London that 600 Liberian soldiers were guarding a rebel diamond mine. </p> <p>In July, the UN security council imposed a ban on the purchase of Sierra Leone diamonds that do not have a government certificate in an effort to prevent the RUF from financing its long-running civil war, in which tens of thousands have been killed and maimed.</p>",

  "Trade unions in Turkey are threatening a mass campaign against a government plan to authorise the dismissal of thousands of civil servants suspected of supporting radical Islamist or Kurdish groups. <p>Union leaders warned yesterday that the government would have a struggle to get the bill approved when parliament returns from its summer recess. </p> <p>\"We will lobby every deputy in parliament and mobilise all our forces against [the measure],\" said Resul Akay, of the conservative union Kamu-Sen, which has several hundred thousand members. Other unions and human rights groups have also expressed their opposition. </p> <p>It could become quite a fight. The national security council, which is dominated by military leaders, said earlier this week that there was an urgent need to pass legislation as soon as possible. </p> <p>The plan to get rid of what the establishment calls \"enemies of the state\" has already provoked a constitutional crisis. </p> <p>The government tried to change the law by cabinet decree but President Ahmet Necdet Sezer twice refused to sign it. </p> <p>The president, who took office in May, emphasised that his veto was not aimed at the proposal itself, but he has insisted that it must be introduced by parliamentary legislation rather than cabinet decree. </p> <p>The government has responded angrily by publicly accusing Mr Sezer of exceeding his powers and hindering the fight against radical Islam. </p> <p>Pressure from the military establishment seems to be the decisive factor behind the rising political temperature. The generals are reported to have criticised the president behind the scenes, and they are demanding results. </p> <p>A report presented to the national security council identified 252 local governors among those who are alleged to be sympathetic to the Islamist cause. </p> <p>The move to sack \"suspect\" civil servants is part of a continuing campaign against political Islam which was launched with military backing more than three years ago. In 1997 Turkey's first Islamist-led government was forced to resign by what local commentators called a \"soft coup\". </p> <p>The unions are afraid that the proposed dismissals may turn into a witch-hunt. </p> <p>They also argue that Turkey's reputation abroad will be badly damaged at a time when it is trying to meet a series of conditions laid down by the European Union for countries which wants to begin negotiations for membership.</p>",
  "Seven years after the Russian army pulled out of its base in Klomino, in north-western Poland, the surrounding woods are still sprinkled with landmines and the groundwater is polluted by a 2cm-thick layer of fuel. <p>The derelict village, which lies close to the coast and the German border, is one of hundreds of former military installations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary which have not yet been put to a new use. </p> <p>The Polish state, which now owns the bases, is hoping for foreign investment and eventual European Union funds, but in the meantime Poles are taking the job of transforming them into their own hands. </p> <p>Margareta Substych, a 23-year-old grocer's assistant, began squatting with her family in a former officer's three-roomed flat in Klomino immediately after the Russians pulled out in 1993. </p> <p>Until recently they had no running water, electricity, or neighbours. But an oil-fired boiler and sewage treatment plant have now been installed to lure investors, along with water-purification and waste-disposal systems. And some months ago another family moved into the estate, which has 700 flats, and together they tend a vegetable garden and feed off an apple orchard. </p> <p>There are other signs of growth. A local law firm has hired a bodyguard to protect two buildings it has just bought, and the Roman Catholic church plans to consecrate the base cinema, which it reportedly acquired for a dollar. </p> <p>Just a few miles north-east, in Borne Sulinowo, is an example of what Klomino aspires to. </p> <p>A few years ago the town existed only on Russian military maps. When the Russians left in a negotiated withdrawal four years after the collapse of communism, their troops took every light-bulb, window-pane, tap, drain-hole cover and sewage pump. Some rooms were even stripped of their wallpaper. </p> <p>Yet today the town demonstrates the hidden potential of the old bases. </p> <p>\"It was such a shock to see it,\" said Maria Czerwiska, head of the local government commission. \"There was no water purification and electricity cables ran willy-nilly underground unprotected by plastic tubing.\" </p> <p>When some of the cables exploded, it was discovered that the withdrawing army had taken the transmission plans with them. </p> <p>But Ms Czerwiska insisted that the Russians left behind a rare opportunity and a chance for the Poles to put their innovative skills to the test. </p> <p>The scale of the challenge is huge. Poland has around 70 former bases and has so far been able to pump in just 164m zloty (\u00a325m). Most of the sprawling derelict sites contain huge blocks of flats, hospitals, aircraft hangars and weed-infested runways. </p> <p>On some of them the huge buildings have been turned into old people's homes and refugee centres. </p> <p>In Kluzewo, Dutch farmers grow potatoes along the abandoned runway and store the crop in bunkers that once housed Soviet fighters. There are plans to turn Bagicz on the Baltic coast into a tourist resort. The singer Michael Jackson has even expressed interest in building a \u00a3330m theme park on an abandoned airfield near Warsaw. </p> <p>Back in Borne Sulinowo, the mayor, Jacek Chrzanowski, is optimistic about the town's future now that the landmines and fuel spills have been cleared. </p> <p>\"We started off with no inhabitants. Now we have 3,600 and the population is growing at around 500 per year,\" he said. Sixty per cent are under 35, and 50% have a secondary or higher education, 10 times the average figure for rural areas. </p> <p>What's more, Borne Sulinowo's land and young population is just 166 miles from Berlin and not far from a planned motorway between Scandinavia and central Europe. </p> <p>A priest was the first to arrive, setting up St Albert's church in the base's former cinema. From the mid-90s a gradual stream of adventurous types started to come from all over Poland as news spread of cheap flats in the former barracks in beautiful countryside. </p> <p>\"There s now a complete social mix from all over the country, a phenomena which has never occurred in Poland before,\" Mr Chrzanowski said, proud of the region's pine forests, and its rich fishing and hunting opportunities. </p> <p>The community now includes artists from Warsaw, doctors from the south, redundant miners and former prisoners. Three-hundred businesses have taken advantage of a three-year tax-break, cheap property, and low-cost labour. They include a German paint factory and a 400-employee Polish wood-processing business which exports 98% of its garden furniture products. </p> <p>Plans are afoot to relocate 80 laid-off miners and their families from the industrial heartland of Silesia. Here their thin pensions will go much further and the microclimate will help those with breathing difficulties. Doctors boast that the air has something special to it, since the town's birthrate is roughly six times the Polish average. </p> <p>\"I know two 'infertile' families from Silesia who came here and got pregnant almost immediately,\" said Dariusz Tedenko a community policeman and historian. </p> <p>But despite strenuous local efforts it will probably take until Poland s accession to the European Union - which it aspires to join within the next three years - for it to acquire the amount of development capital needed to realise the bases' potential.</p>",
  "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, yesterday urged the United States to join moves to set up an international criminal court that will attempt to bring to trial those responsible for genocide. <p>Mr Cook dismissed US objections to the court, which has already won the backing of almost 100 countries. </p> <p>The government yesterday published a draft bill to ratify the ICC. The law has to be changed to pave the way for the setting up of the court, including empowering Britain to take action against dictators that abuse their powers. </p> <p>The US Congress fears that US servicemen could be tried for any abuses committed overseas. </p> <p>But Mr Cook described this as a mistake. \"The international criminal court will act only where national courts have failed to offer a remedy. Therefore, I think the concern about US servicemen is misplaced. </p> <p>\"There is a strong judicial system in the US, it can take action itself if there were to be breaches of international humanitarian law by US servicemen... in those circumstances the ICC does not apply. </p> <p>\"We in Britain would not be exposing our servicemen to vexatious prosecution. We have signed up to the ICC because we are confident there is no risk of that.\" </p> <p>Mr Cook said the court will send a \"very clear signal to dictators around the world that they cannot get away with mass murder, genocide, or crimes against humanity, such as employing child soldiers\". </p> <p>Even without the US, there is a powerful coalition. Ninety-eight countries have backed the court. </p> <p>The ICC will have an independent prosecutor who can decide what cases to initiate without seeking permission from the UN security council, where decisions are often deadlocked. </p> <p>Mr Cook said: \"It will be a court which will have powers, not just of severe punishment of up to 30 years in prison, but it will also be able to order them to pay reparation to the victims, because people who are brutal dictators often become wealthy dictators, and this court can deal not just with their crimes, but with that wealth.\" </p> <p>In reality, the court is more likely to be effective against small-scale dictators, such as Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, provided he could be arrested. </p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, while welcoming the court in principle, questioned its effectiveness if the US and China declined to sign up. </p> <p>Kate Allen, Amnesty International director, said: \"The draft bill represents a major step forward in the search for global justice.

  "A private hospital has turned down a surgeon's request to amputate a healthy limb from a patient suffering from a rare psychological disorder. <p>Robert Smith wanted to operate at Abbey King's Park hospital in Stirling to remove the right leg of an American patient with body dysmorphic disorder, a condition which causes sufferers to hate a part of their body. </p> <p>Mr Smith was banned from performing similar operations at Falkirk Royal Infirmary, an NHS hospital, after it was discovered that he had amputated healthy limbs from two private patients there. </p> <p>Abbey King's Park officials said they had refused the surgery on business grounds and because of public concern over the issue. </p> <p>\"I would like to see a detailed piece of research so that people in this country can have the opportunity to consider more carefully, because for the vast majority it is still an issue that simply can't be understood,\" said the hospital's managing director, Eric Hemming. </p> <p>Mr Smith is on annual leave, but the patient, Greg Furth, from New York, attacked the decision and backed Mr Hemming's call for more research into the issue. </p> <p>This is the second time that he has failed in an attempt to have the operation in Scotland and the third time the hospital has refused a similar request from Mr Smith.

  "Two suicides in the space of a week at a jail near Rouen have rekindled debate about French prison conditions, just weeks after a damning parliamentary report said the country's jails were \"the humiliation of the Republic\". <p>The unnamed men, both serving long sentences for child sex offences, hanged themselves in their cells at the Val de Reuil penitentiary last week. Both were victims of what the International Prisons Observatory called \"brutal harassment\" in the jail, France's largest, which holds 400 long-term and 400 short-term prisoners. </p> <p>Prison warders blamed a shortage of manpower, a crippling lack of resources and an atmosphere of \"appalling insecurity\" due largely to the growing number of psychologically disturbed inmates. </p> <p>\"The situation is the same all over France,\" said Philippe Dor\u00e9 of the prison officers' union. \"We try to do a good job but it's impossible. There are too few of us, we're demotivated and we're being sent more and more psychotics.

The place remains an inhuman nightmare, an eternal shame to France.\" </p> <p>Partly in response to the furore surrounding Ms Vasseur's book and to surveys showing that nearly 50% of the French believe their country's prison system is rotten, MPs and senators produced two reports on the nation's jails in July, just before their summer recess. </p> <p>The cross-party reports, based on prison visits and interviews with former inmates, warders, relatives, magistrates and prison directors, concluded that drastic reforms were needed, particularly as France's prison population has doubled over the past 40 years. </p> <p>\"We need to rethink the entire basis of our prison system,\" Jacques Floch, a Socialist MP and co-author of one report, said. \"We have no single body of legislation directly governing prison conditions and no consistent penal policy, just reactive, day-by-day chaos.\" </p> <p>The deputies were critical of plans by the justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, to build half a dozen big new jails, arguing that alternative punishment or treatment would be far more appropriate than prison for many inmates. </p> <p>They demanded instead a multi-million pound refurbishment programme and the construction of small new detention centres where conditions could be more effectively maintained and inmates prepared for their return to society.</p>",
  "Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, stunned the US this week by using a visit to Washington to press his call for an open US-Mexico border and a North American economic union similar to the EU. <p>President Bill Clinton and the men who want to succeed him have pleaded with Mr Fox to cool his demands. </p> <p>The US may be the world's main advocate of lowered barriers, but Mr Fox's proposal on August 17 for a North American common market in capital, goods and labour has set political alarm bells ringing in the runup to the presidential election. </p> <p>US and Canadian leaders have told Mr Fox during his visit to the two countries this week that the idea of an open border with a country synonymous for many Americans with drug smuggling and cheap labour is too radical for domestic political consumption. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Fox travelled to Dallas to meet George W Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, who is also the governor of Texas, the US state with the longest border with Mexico. </p> <p>Mr Bush was expected to make it clear that he would not be interested in Mr Fox's open-border plan. </p> <p>\"I don't think he's fully explained open borders,\" Mr Bush said before the meeting. \"I believe we ought to enforce our borders.\" </p> <p>The US should have a \"special relationship with Mexico as clear and strong as we have had with Canada and Great Britain\", he said yesterday. </p> <p>On Thursday the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore, had a similar message for Mr Fox. </p> <p>\"Gore said some elements of Fox's proposal were problematic for the US,\" his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, said after the men met in Washington. </p> <p>\"But he was interested to note that Fox wanted to paint this as a very long-term vision,\" he added </p> <p>Mr Clinton was less dismissive. \"Obviously we have borders and we have laws that apply to them, and we have to apply them, and so do the Mexicans,\" he said after meeting Mr Fox, who is due to be sworn in on December 1. </p> <p>\"But I think that over the long run our countries will become more interdependent.\" </p> <p>The US and Canada welcomed the former Coca-Cola executive's election in July as a potential breakthrough in relations with Mexico. </p> <p>But Mr Fox caused alarm when he said that he hoped this month's visit would lay the foundations for an opening of borders between the three countries, which are signatories to the 1994 North American free trade agreement (Nafta). </p> <p>In an interview with American journalists, Mr Fox cited the EU as a model of states in a region building a working common market with a free movement of capital and labour. </p> <p>\"It doesn't necessarily have to be the same as the European Union,\" he said. \"But they can serve as an inspiration for us.\" </p> <p>Mr Fox said that the three Nafta countries should set common economic goals for the next 10 years for inflation, interest rates and budget deficits. He said the border could be opened gradually, beginning with free transit in a limited zone, or with more temporary visas for Mexican workers, who currently remit about $6bn (\u00a34bn) a year to relatives. </p> <p>In Ottawa on Wednesday the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, poured cold water on Mr Fox's ideas, setting a tone which was maintained in the US. </p> <p>\"I don't think we can adopt the European model in the years to come,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Nafta is working very well for now.\" </p> <p>The chief fear is that Mr Fox's plans would bring a huge increase in Mexican migration to the US, helping to drive down US wages and the price of American exports. </p> <p>Mr Fox says that his aim is to create economic conditions which will help to stem the flow of legal and illegal migration across the border. </p> <p>\"The best thing that could happen to the United States is to have a successful Mexico, a Mexico without poverty, a Mexico without violence, a Mexico without drug smuggling, a Mexico with employment opportunities for all, where people don't have to migrate to the United States,\" he said on August 17. </p> <p>\u0095In a speech yesterday on relations with Latin America, Mr Bush said that, if elected, he would seek authority to negotiate free trade agreements with all the countries of the region. </p> <p><b> Going north </b> Immigrants in the US <br> </p> <p> \u0095About 7m Mexicans live in the US, equivalent to 8% of the Mexican population. Roughly a third are illegal immigrants </p> <p>\u0095Mexicans easily top the lists for both legal and illegal immigration into the United States. In 1998, 131,575 Mexicans legally migrated to the US: 20% of the total admitted </p> <p>\u00952.7m Mexican illegal immigrants, more than half the illegal immigrant total, are estimated to be living in the US. The number is believed to be growing by about 150,000 a year, according to the US immigration and naturalisation service </p> <p>\u0095Two out of five illegal immigrants in the US live in California. Texas, New York and Florida are the other states with high numbers </p> <p>\u0095More than 1.53m migrants, overwhelmingly Mexican, were detained by US border control officers last year on the US-Mexico border. The vast majority, 1.49m, were returned across the border </p> <p>\u0095Last year 359 people died attempting to cross the border from Mexico into the US. Most deaths are by drowning or exposure and dehydration. Only about half are identified</p>",
  "<p>There's only one section of the humongous Sunday New York Times that I miss when I'm in London every summer. No, not the sports pages; I can get the baseball scores from the Herald Tribune. Not the political conventions; the British coverage is lively and ample. And certainly not the Book Review, which is a duty rather than a pleasure. </p> <p>But one part of the Sunday Times can't be summarised or replaced: the wedding announcements. Since 1994, the New York Times has turned routine society bulletins into a fascinating human-interest feature. The process was gradual. First, studio portraits of the bride in her finery diminished, replaced by informal shots of the bride and groom together. Although the Times still insisted that the couple be conservatively attired and posed, these snapshots revealed much that had been invisible before about marital choices - age differences, sense of style, racial intermarriage, and, paradoxically, the tendency for people to chose those who resemble them. Many couples could be brother and sister. </p> <p>Second, the wedding announcements got more detailed. The Times began printing the ages of the bride and groom, and nowadays in an entire week, most are over 30. The announcements also reflect the impact of feminism; many brides plan to keep their maiden names, and have jobs as impressive as those of their partners. Indeed, as David Brooks says in Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There, the Times weddings are the new \"mergers and acquisitions\" page. The Times, he charges, \"emphasizes four things about a person - college degrees, graduate degrees, career path, and parents' profession - for these are the markers of upscale Americans today\". </p> <p>But the dreams of upscale Americans are surprisingly diverse, as we learned when the Times began to treat one wedding a week in depth in a column called \"Vows\". </p> <p>Lois Smith Brady, the writer, attended weddings and interviewed friends and relatives to compile a profile of the happy couple. When she began the column, Brady explains in her book Love Lessons (2000), her \"main goal was to describe in the least frilly way possible, very frilly and overdone things - gigantic wedding dresses, million-dollar flower displays, cakes decorated with sugar swans\". But she soon discovered that she was actually writing about love stories. \"I have come to view Vows as a small-town kind of column... stories with happy endings... proof that love, optimism, guts, grace, perfect partners and very good luck do exist.\" Her stories depict a Manhattan as moodily romantic as the setting of a Woody Allen movie, and as rosily democratic as a Fourth of July barbecue. </p> <p>This past week, for example, the Vows column described the wedding of Althea Beaton and Malik Shabazz Ducard, who both received scholarships to boarding schools from A Better Chance, an organisation that \"places and guides minority children in private schools\", and met as students in African politics at Columbia University. The bride, who now works for Mattel, has \"eyelashes as long as a giraffe's, a waist as thin as Barbie's, a deep laugh and a hard-working, ambitious temperament.\" The bride explained that her husband, an executive at MGM, fits well into her family: \"The men in my family had humble beginnings. They worked hard, studied hard, and reached a level of success, and Malik is cut from that same cloth.\" </p> <p> Most recently, the Times has expanded wedding announcements to include the personal details that have enchanted readers of Vows. On August 20, we read how Joshua Steckel wooed Beth Zasloff by giving her his old couch and helping her move it into her new apartment. \"I had fantasies about our grandchildren sleeping on that couch,\" Ms Zasloff recalled. Samantha Atkins and Kenneth Ahdoot, on the next page, met in an anatomy class in their first year of medical school. \"I thought he was cute, and so I would go over to check out his cadaver and ask questions,\" Dr Atkins said. Another couple met through Drip Cafe, a singles coffee bar on the Upper West Side, with the staff playing matchmaker. At first glance, this sounds as kitschy as Friends, but the couple were in their 50s. </p> <p>In contrast, British newspapers treat marriages in two lines of names, places, and dates, unless the newlyweds are Posh and Becks, or the landed gentry cavorting in the glossy magazines. The emphasis here is either sociological, emphasising rising costs and ostentatious display, or autobiographical, with columnists telling their own stories, including many unhappy endings. Perhaps the American press sees marriage as a metaphor for the American dream, always optimistic and infinitely renewable, and the British press is dominated by tough-minded realists, who believe that vows of true love are best assessed in retrospect, at the end of a marriage or at the end of a life. Parading one's romantic good luck here seems like naivete at best, and maybe even hubris.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton arrives in Nigeria today to bolster a president whose battles with legislators and growing public disdain make his own political tribulations pale by comparison. <p>His visit coincides with growing American alarm at the state of Nigeria's fledgling democracy. Olusegun Obasanjo has only been in power for 15 months and he is already faced with no confidence motions in the corruption-plagued parliament, a disillusioned public who believes that political feuding is denying them better living conditions, and increasing religious and ethnic separatism. </p> <p>\"If democracy takes root in Nigeria, it will lift up an entire region,\" Mr Clinton said this week. \"So we'll do our part to help with trade and investment in [Nigeria's] efforts to ensure that the vast wealth it has accumulated and squandered in the past finally benefits its people.\" </p> <p>The last US president to visit Nigeria was Jimmy Carter. Mr Obasanjo was running the country on that occasion too, but as a military ruler. Mr Clinton bypassed Nigeria in his tour of Africa two years ago because the brutal General Sani Abacha was ensconced as dictator. </p> <p>Now Nigeria is one of the four countries - along with Ukraine, Colombia and Indonesia -identified by the Americans as the key to building democratic and stable government in their respective regions. </p> <p>Two years ago it was getting no financial aid from the US. Now it is the biggest beneficiary in sub-Saharan Africa. But its problems are manifold. Mr Clinton was to have visited Kano, the commercial capital of the north, and Port Harcourt, the south-eastern centre of the Nigeria's blighted oil industry. Both visits were called off for \"security\" reasons. </p> <p>Despite the big security contingent accompanying him, the state of Kano was considered too dangerous, because of the surge in Islamic fundamentalism in northern Nigeria. </p> <p>Strict sharia law has been introduced in eight states this year, most recently in Kano, and there was concern how an admitted adulterer would be received by hardline religious leaders and a public prone to murderous anti-Christian riots. </p> <p>Mr Clinton would have been far more welcome in the Niger delta, but while that would have posed few threats to his physical wellbeing, it carried political dangers. He could hardly have gone to Port Harcourt without meeting the leaders of the communities which consider themselves blighted by pollution and repressed as a result of the exploitation of the region's oil resources by big companies, including US companies such as Chevron. </p> <p>Had he met them, Mr Clinton would have been put in the delicate position of either having to sympathise with the victims or defend the oil companies. </p> <p><b> Turmoil</b><br> </p> <p> So Mr Clinton will remain in Abuja, the least Nigerian of Nigeria's cities. The capital, carved out of the bush 20 years ago, rarely suffers the power cuts, fuel shortages and subsiding roads that plague Lagos and other big cities. </p> <p>Nevertheless he will have few problems experiencing the turmoil of Nigerian politics. He is to address a joint sitting of the national assembly, which is perpetually feuding with Mr Obasanjo at the expense of a great deal of much-needed legislation, including bills to combat corruption and develop the oil region. </p> <p>The president accuses parliamentarians of incompetence and corruption, not without justification after they secretly voted themselves each a \u00a332,000 furniture allowance. </p> <p>For the third time in little more than a year, members of the upper house have had to find a new leader after the most recent senate president, Chuba Okadigbo, was exposed as having illegally awarding himself \u00a3390,000 in allowances and a Christmas bonus. </p> <p>Mr Okadigbo even spirited the mace from the senate chambers in an effort to prevent its members from impeaching him. </p> <p>Earlier this week the US embassy was still trying to find out who the senate's leaders are so that they can be invited to meet Mr Clinton. </p> <p>The parliamentarians hit back by accusing Mr Obasanjo of overstepping his powers and showing dictatorial tendencies. His growing band of critics say he provides little leadership and spends too much time touring the globe to promote Nigeria, instead of staying at home to force through legislation and privatisation programmes. </p> <p>The political standoff led to a six-month delay in passing this year's budget. When Mr Obasanjo accused MPs of wanting to be paid off, the chairman of the lower house's anti-corruption committee, Adams Jagaba, responded this week with a motion of no confidence in the president and an implicit threat of impeachment. </p> <p>\"He should know that he is creating more problems than solutions, and that is a dangerous signal,\" he said. \"This is because the national assembly might be forced to exercise its constitutional powers on him. I am sure Clinton would have a word or two to say on the relationship between the arms of government.\" </p> <p>With Mr Clinton's visit looming, the house backed away from the confrontation and shelved the motion. But once he has gone it will be back on the agenda. </p> <p>\"I think you could fairly say that whatever problems Clinton has with a hostile Congress it is nothing compared to what Obasanjo has to deal with,\" a US diplomat said. </p> <p>\"The man's been in office for a year or so and they're already trying to get him out because he won't let them rob the treasury at will. </p> <p>\"But Obasanjo is also a big part of the problem. He provides no leadership. He spends a lot of time out of the country, and it is true that he has this authoritarian style of leadership which might have been all right when he was last in power but is too inflexible for what needs to be done in Nigeria today.\" </p> <p>Mr Obasanjo has undoubtedly curbed the single most immediate threat to Nigeria's fledgling democracy, the military, by purging the upper echelons of the army of the most corrupt and least loyal officers. </p> <p>But there are those who are afraid that his efforts may all prove academic. The question debated interminably in Nigeria's vibrant press is whether Mr Obasanjo is presiding over the breakup of a country which has held together for 40 years of independence despite the odds and a bloody civil war. For months Mr Obasanjo brushed aside the crisis provoked by sharia rule in the north and its impact on the ever louder separatist rumblings of the south. </p> <p><b> Intolerance</b><br> </p> <p> He argued that they were a distraction from his serious efforts to steer the lumbering Nigerian ship of state away from the rocks. But eventually he was forced to concede that religious and regional fanaticism threatened to overwhelm his reforms. This week he pleaded for tolerance. </p> <p>\"We need the right environment devoid of rancour and acrimony; an atmosphere of tolerance, of give and take, and of brotherliness and good neighbourliness is desired for progress. We will achieve nothing if everyone takes up arms against the other. A nation cannot subsist under an atmosphere of intolerance,\" he said. </p> <p>Bill Clinton will be steered well clear of the politics, but he will get a glimpse of the consequences. His only journey outside Nigeria's sterile capital will be to the tiny village of Pykasa, seven miles from Abuja. It too has been spruced up: villagers have been hurriedly filling in the pot holes. </p> <p>But the local chief, Amos Tuzambo, has higher aims. He hopes Mr Clinton will deliver what his own president cannot. </p> <p>\"I have been informed the American president will visit my domain. He will see our needs. We need water, electricity, a school, and a hospital would be nice,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>One of the strangest sights in London can be found in Somerset House. In a room attached to the Gilbert collection is a reproduction of Sir Arthur Gilbert's study in Beverly Hills, with a life-size waxwork of Gilbert, wearing tennis clothes and holding a large white telephone. I don't know if in real life the great collector has his own hair, but in this corner of his lovely home, he appears to be wearing a toupee: the effect is ghoulish. On a wall facing the dynamic but inanimate tycoon are two portraits of Sir Arthur and Lady Gilbert. These appear to have been painted by the people who produce pictures of ancestors for low-budget TV films. They may be two of the worst portraits I have ever seen. I found myself staring at this room with more attention than I devoted to the bejewelled snuffboxes and ornate silver that Gilbert collected. </p> <p>I tried to imagine the circumstances in which a very rich, elderly, man would have demanded his own mini Madame Tussaud's as a condition of making over some of his treasures to Somerset House. I tried to imagine that most suave of men, Lord Rothschild, announcing to his fellow trustees that the idea was to have a waxwork of Sir Arthur Gilbert in tennis clothes, holding a phone, as part of the display. Perhaps he suggested it might be a kind of Jeff Koons work of art in itself - a little light relief from the unrelenting opulence of the collection. Malcolm Muggeridge described failure in politics as casting a retrospective gloom - like adultery, I think he added - and I found myself feeling retrospectively gloomy about the Gilbert collection. </p> <p>Could it be that the whole collection was in some way a demonstration of the magpie tendency - glitter as a top priority? And then I fell to wondering about the motives of many of the great collectors, and my conclusions were sombre. In one gallery is a display of a new artform (new to me) called \"micromosaics\" by Gilbert. These are reproductions of paintings and in some cases original works, done in tiny glass mosaics. From a distance they look more or less as though they have been painted. Close to, you see that they are in fact a fantastically pointless exercise in painting by numbers, done with tiny pieces of mosaic, as many as 1,400 pieces of coloured glass per square inch. They look like deranged souvenirs. But I did decide that if I ever acquired another elephant, I would save up for a silver howdah. Gilbert has two, flogged off by impoverished maharajahs. </p> <p> \u0095 A new book, A Mouthful of Glass, by a Dutch writer, explores the life of Demetrios Tsafendas, the man who in 1966 murdered the architect of apartheid, Hendrik Verwoerd. Demetrios was a temporary messenger in the parliament. He stabbed Verwoerd in the neck. </p> <p>I spoke to the author, Henk van Woerden, whose parents emigrated to South Africa. He told me he had long been fascinated by the story, not least because Verwoerd was also the son of Dutch immigrants. Tsafendas died last year in the asylum where he was forgotten for many years. Van Woerden met him and said he had considerable charm. </p> <p>As a boy, I used to go to the Rand Easter Show in Johannesburg, mainly to meet horsey girls. There, not 20 yards from where I was sitting in 1960, a farmer called David Pratt shot Verwoerd twice in the head with a .22 pistol from very close range. Verwoerd lived, although I remember his bodyguard being carried out on a stretcher, after fainting. Pratt, too, was declared insane, but committed suicide. I rushed from the showgrounds and told the first group of Africans I came across what I had seen. </p> <p>They were ecstatically happy, particularly as I reported that Verwoerd was certainly dead. The fact that Verwoerd was attempting to create a sort of science out of apartheid was understood to be more dangerous than mere prejudice. Verwoerd's grandson is now a member of the African National Congress, having had a Damascene conversion when he travelled to Britain and Holland on a scholarship in the early 80s. His father has disowned him. </p> <p>The extraordinary aspect of this story is that in so few years, so much can change. George Bernard Shaw once said that almost within his lifetime a witch had been burned in Dublin. In my lifetime a Verwoerd has joined the ANC. To me this is more remarkable than the end of witch-burning. </p> <p>#149; Islington has become a by-word for pretentiousness, presumption, upward mobility, trendiness, and - worst of all - for a cabal involving journalists, lawyers, politicians and Cambridge-educated comedians, all of whom meet socially to plan the destruction of Britain as we know it. I have lived here for many years. The reason is very simple: it was the only place in central London I could afford. People who lived in Chelsea and Notting Hill Gate and Hampstead sympathised. Of course they did not know that it was to become the Athens of North One. Nor did I. For years it was described as \"up-and-coming\" Islington, but that was mainly in the fevered imagination of estate agents. We incomers kept our heads down and cultivated the locals nervously, not wanting to suggest that we had arrived to gentrify or disturb a working-class neighbourhood. </p> <p>For years no Range Rover or green wellie was ever seen in Islington. During the 80s, the working class voted with their feet. They couldn't believe their luck - people wanted to buy the run-down houses their nans had lumbered them with. They set off for Chingford and all places east. And suddenly commentators began to spot Islington Man and Islington Woman. No longer were they earnest muesli-makers, but they were active in politics, the law and journalism. They had graduated from impoverished trainee solicitors to partners in City law firms; they acquired a few titles; they took their holidays in Chiantishire; they meddled in politics. Tony Blair was their finest product. In this way the myth was born. </p> <p>The truth is that Islington is one of the most mixed boroughs in London with a huge proportion of council property; the schools are in a constant state of urban flux; the streets are often filthy; the parks are full of school kids drinking vodka and lighting up; the council is deeply in debt and the restaurants, with rare exceptions, are deplorable. At night, Upper Street, where the avocado pear was once just a rumour, is now six-deep in the hedonistic in search of guacamole. I have lived here so long I remember when you could park wherever you liked, and witches were burned on Islington Green. Or recycled, as we used to call it back then. </p> <p>\u0095 Simon Hoggart is away</p>",
  "<p>Hearing that Craig David song the other day, it was brought home to me by the silky voiced one how staid my bedtime habits have become. Call it the strains of busy modern life, the pressures of work, the long-standing relationship or just old fashioned laziness, but for too long now the Wilson household has been stuck in a bedtime radio rut. A lovely rut, but a rut all the same. Late Junction plus Radio 4 at the weekends, occasionally dipping into World Service fare. Sigh. </p> <p>David, on the other hand, meets a \"beautiful honey\" who asks him the time (that old one) on a Monday afternoon, treating her to Mo\u00ebt (that old one) on Tuesday, makin' lurve for the rest of the week and chillin' on Sunday. </p> <p>With this in mind, and translated into my wireless world, I began a giddy week of flirtation, eyeing up, rampant promiscuity with the knobs on my trannie. It has three. </p> <p>My first lovely honey came in the form of Edwina Currie on Late Night Currie (Radio 5 Live) on Sunday. This is such a perky little number, it makes Late Junction's penchant for Mongolian nose flute symphonies from the 12th century look positively pedestrian. This is mainly due to Currie's dominatrix approach to presenting. Tony Bullimore was on to talk about sailing round the world with Lenny Henry, as you do. </p> <p>Maybe it's since his mid-Atlantic near-death experience, but boy can he ramble on. He also has one of those talking tics that, once you notice it, drowns out everything else he says. My mum has a friend who does this, starting every sentence with \"I/She/He/They turned around and said_\". You can't listen without visualising every member of her personal cast as perpetual spinning tops. Bullimore's is \"you know\", said like a muted Frankie Howerd, linking together some of the longest stories known to man. La Currie was going crackers, snipping, snapping, finishing his sentences and verbally bundling him out of the studio. </p> <p>She interviewed a woman who has spent 40 years with chimps too. This was just as much fun, with the woman telling us about Froddo, \"The biggest, strongest chimp we've even known\". He knocks you over, drags you a bit and sometimes stamps on you. So that is where Edwina learned her interview technique. I had the most lurid dreams after this frothy mix, I can tell you. </p> <p>Monday, wimped out back to Late Junction in shock. Emboldened by some frog music (yes, really) I spent Tuesday bedtime in the company of shock jock James Whale on Talk Sport. It all made perfect sense in the world that is Talk. Whale was calling for camps in which to deposit scumbags (asylum seekers) and grotbags (beggars) and was encouraging us to \"smile\" about the fate of the Kursk, as it's sinking meant one sub and lots of Russian sailors less to worry about as enemies. The Cold War hasn't defrosted on Talk. </p> <p>\"Russia's more dangerous now than ever,\" he told one caller, a woman who like me had just found Whale by accident. Her husband was away, she said, as if that's the only reason she could go wild and touch that dial. I counted my blessings and dreamed of a camp for all the Talk Sport presenters and callers. One caller stopped what he was saying to inform the nation that a topless lady was peering out of a window in Kensington. Another had written to Teletext about the Kursk. Teletext. </p> <p>Wednesday brought the bizarre feast that is the Janice Long show (Radio 2). The mix is some music (Los Lobos, Sheryl Crow, kd lang), some competitions, and some gentle polemic from our Janice. Nasty Nick fever is out of control she said. \"There are people in this country who have committed far worse crimes, I'm sure,\" she said, all sage-like. </p> <p>A man called Thomas called in with the wrong answer for a quiz. Why do that? Why put him on just to humiliate him? Especially when he was clearly an ex-colleague of David Shayler's. \"I can't say where I am,\" said Tommy, calling from his workplace. Asked if he wanted to say hello to anyone, he almost whispered: \"That might reveal where I am.\" </p> <p>Where I am now, is back in my late-night listening rut. It's staid, I know, and Craig David will never pen a song about me, but I'm sleeping much better, thanks all the same.</p>",
  "<p>It is May 9, Europe Day. Ragged, marching lines of schoolchildren enter the Klagenfurt town square waving the blue-and-gold flags of the European Union under a cloudless sky. Lining the square, Europe has set out its stalls: Euro pens; Euro hats; Euro stickers; and Roland Prinz, an executive of the Hypo Bank, in a tie decorated with samples of the new euro currency, is glowing with Euro-pride as he thrusts into people's hands postcards which, like his tie, depict the banknotes that in two years' time will replace the Austrian schilling. More and more children arrive, and the square is now filled with Euro people, who five years ago, before entry into the EU, were just Austrians living in the region of Carinthia, on the border of Italy and Slovenia.</p> <p>One school has marked the event by giving each child a placard listing one of the rights enshrined in the European charter: freedom to work; freedom of religion; equality before the law, no censorship. Another has handed every pupil a home-made sign with the flag of a different country bearing the word peace in its language. Paix! Shalom! It's the opposite of a Nuremberg rally - informal, undisciplined, all the racist poison sucked out of it. Except that, according to the programme, the keynote speaker is to be J\u00f6rg Haider, governor of Carinthia and, until his resignation earlier that year, leader of the far-right Freedom Party, a man now tagged as Europe's most dangerous racist and xenophobe. (Haider, however, denies that his anti-immigration policies are xenophobic or racist.) Someone says he has decided not to turn up, after all. Where is he? In Vienna. Yet rumours persist that he might yet show, for he is, it's said, a law unto himself, who travels by helicopter and, like God, can be anywhere at short notice. And so we look up at the sky, hoping to hear a heavy drone. </p> <p>Because of Haider, Austria is under EU sanctions, Israel has cut off diplomatic relations, tourism to the country has plummeted, and Austrians themselves, travelling abroad, are being greeted with a cold shoulder. Last year, on October 3, the Freedom Party (FPO) came second in the elections, throwing the country into political paralysis and sparking the largest protest demonstrations Austria has ever known. After months of agonising, in February the FPO was invited by the conservative People's Party, under the chancellorship of Wolfgang Schussel, to join a coalition, partly in fear that, if no government could be formed and fresh elections were held, the FPO would win outright with its appeal to nationalism and calls for measures to restrict the numbers of foreign workers allowed into the country. </p> <p>A couple of months before the end of Europe's most catastrophically violent century, people were talking once more of a new menace coming out of Austria. Was Haider the new f\u00fchrer, an Austrian dictator who would provoke a world war? The comparison between Haider and Hitler is probably hysterical. Periods of history are not templates that can be imposed on each other. Austria has a population of eight million, and it took one of its foreign workers, an Israeli who runs a fast-food stand near a U-Bahn station in Vienna, to put things into perspective: \"Germany in the 30s was a strong country; it had an army, an air force, a navy - things Hitler could use to get what he wanted,\" he said. \"This place? What's Austria got? Nothing. It's a country of no consequence. It's got no military. No industry. Ski slopes - that's all.\" </p> <p>We would be fools to believe that nazism is resurgent in Europe. Seventy years ago, totalitarianism was not imposed on the people; it was a political movement with mass and intellectual support. In his book, Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century, the historian Mark Mazower describes the hostility to democracy among the thinkers and politicians of the right in the 20s who dismissed parliamentarianism as \"sluggish, materialistic, unexciting and incapable of arousing the sympathy of the masses\". The experiment in excitement was, of course, a disaster. Despite the endurance of a few skinheads, vandalism in Jewish cemeteries and an admiration for the racist and anti-Semite (formerly known as a historian) David Irving, there is no real taste for fascism in Europe these days. If there is anything to fear, we will find it rooted in democratically elected parties that want all the economic benefits of EU membership without the political consequences. </p> <p>A new vision of a Europe is emerging. Borderless inside, it would form a largely white fortress to stand against the alien hordes of Muslims and former communists that menace it from the east, a place that pays lip-service to a tolerance of Jews while focusing on the main agenda, which is to keep immigrants out. In an opinion poll carried out by the French National Human Rights Commission earlier this year, 68% of respondents agreed with the statement: \"The presence in France of people from non-European countries is disturbing.\" </p> <p>In Denmark, Pia Kjaersgaard, leader of the ultra nationalist Danish People's Party with 18% support in opinion polls, regards Muslims as \"as good a people as you or me, but it's a problem in a Christian country to have too many Muslims\". According to the Organi-sation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, Denmark is one of the world's richest countries, with the least success in incorporating foreigners into the workforce. Souhail Ibrahim, a Palestinian who left the Social Democrats in January to form an immigrants' party, told a newspaper, \"I don't think Austria will do half of what they're doing to foreigners in Denmark.\" In Belgium, the Flemish Vlaams Blok, based in its Antwerp stronghold where it attracts 15% of the vote in regional elections, calls for an immediate halt to immigration and the expulsion of unemployed immigrants who are there already. In Norway, the Progress Party, on 15%, wants to divert money spent on immigrants to pensions and health care for Norwegians. And in Britain, with no far right worth speaking of, Labour and Conservatives vie with each other to criminalise refugees and asylum seekers, driving them into detention camps. </p> <p>Who will be at the helm of this new Europe? Across the other side of Klagenfurt town square, Roland Prinz formally introduces me to a smiling, courteous man with a neatly trimmed beard. He gives me his card, which is decorated with the flag of the European Union and the coat of arms of Carinthia, and identifies the bearer as Dr Johannes Maier, Landesmanndirektion, EU-Koordinationstelle: he is the civil servant who advises Haider on European affairs. Maier was delighted to speak to the Guardian, \"a great newspaper\" he said, in contrast to the response to previous efforts to get an interview with Haider himself.</p> <p>We stood and shielded our eyes from the strong sunlight as the children paraded with their European flags. \"Mr Haider is not understood in Europe,\" he told me. \"Yes, he made mistakes in former times, but now he is trying to make policies like any other regional governor in Europe. Please remember, we are not against Europe, we are one of the weaker regions south of the Alpine line, one of the economically weakest regions of Austria and we profit from Europe - one billion schillings [\u00a345 million] a year. But if we look at Europe as a whole, we see that we have no great politician any more, like Mitterand and Kohl, someone who sees Europe as more important than the interests of his country.\" </p> <p>And is Haider that great man? \"Mr Haider is a very intelligent politician,\" Maier replied. \"He can speak very well and pronounce the problems of the people. He is one of the most important politicians now living.\" </p> <p>In Haider's 1995 treatise, a book called The Freedom I Mean, he sets out his vision not just for Austria but for Europe, and so for us, too: \"The concept of a 'multicultural society' has become an ideology,\" he writes. \"Any policy of immigration must insist on assimilation and adaptation to the culture and norms of the indigenous population... Especially in education we have to defend Christian values. As more immigrants bring their children into western Europe, the indigenous population is slowly being substituted by aliens. It's hard to understand why Catholic bishops and clerics march in the streets defending a multi-cultural utopia when the threat to Christianity is so obvious... </p> <p>From 1989-1992, 10,400 new jobs were created in eastern Austria and all of them were filled by cheap foreign labour. At the same time employment of Austrians declined by 1,300... For [our ruling politicians] it's more important to experiment with our youth as guinea pigs in abstract, multicultural programmes.\"</p> <p>And finally, in a grand sign-off: \"Our movement seeks to rally the friends of freedom to regenerate the old democracies and inspire the new. Our enemies are legion both in eastern Europe and the west, where the threats are more subtle and insidious. The road will not be easy, but the rewards will be worth the struggle. That is the challenge for Austria. That is the vision for Europe. That is the freedom I mean.\" </p> <p>Does this sound familiar - particularly the invocation of some hazily defined \"enemies\" on to whom the reader can pin any label he chooses? </p> <p>What is the Freedom Party? It can protest as much as it likes, but the records show that it is directly descended from Austrian National Socialism. In 1945, there were 500,000 registered Nazis in the country. Deprived of the vote until the 1949 election, they formed such a formidable force that neither Conservatives nor Social Democrats dared ignore them, and considerable numbers were absorbed into these two main parties.</p> <p>Immediately after the election, Austria's Nazis organised their own party, the Association of Independents, which split in 1955 but re-formed itself one year later as the Freedom Party. Haider's father, Robert, had joined the Hitler Youth in 1929 and later became a member of the Austrian National Socialists, joining the FPO on its formation. His son became party secretary in Carinthia in 1976 and, supported by the party's most right wing elements, overthrew its liberal wing to become leader in 1986. The last of the liberals left the FPO in 1993. In 1994, according to the Documentation Centre for Austrian Resistance, the FPO campaigned against Austria joining the EU \"using theories of worldwide conspiracies connected with barely concealed anti-semitic arguments\". </p> <p>The FPO's success in recent years is not necessarily because Austria's voters are covert Nazis but because of the corruption of the two main parties, the Conservatives and the Social Democrats, who have shared power continuously since the end of the war.</p> <p>What alternative do Haider and the FPO offer? A few days before I arrived in Carinthia, I sat in the office of the Documentation Centre's director, Wolfgang Neugebauer, the son of a former lieutenant in the SS, who has spent much of his life documenting Austria's Nazi past. He is a spare, blond man who at school, in the 50s, had come under the influence of socialists and somehow wrenched himself away from his father's fascism.</p> <p>\"Haider is a right wing extremist,\" he said. \"He is a racist and xenophobe. Not everyone in the party has the same opinions [as he does], but this is a f\u00fchrer party, a leader party, and he dominates it. After his retirement at the party congress, he still remains the most important politician in the party, and I'm sure that in the next elections he will be a candidate for the Federal Chancellorship. I am not afraid of some small Nazi groups in Austria. The greater danger is the coalition between a party like the FPO, with strong anti-immigrant and xenophobic policies, and a conservative party, and such developments can take place in other countries, too. Such a coalition can realise policy where small groups of extremists can't.\"</p> <p>Would Haider's election as Chancellor be comparable to the election of Hitler in 1933? \"No, I don't think so,\" he replied. \"This is not possible in Europe in this time, but I think he will try to realise his propaganda in the field of foreign labourers and immigrants. There will be a stop to further immigration and, perhaps, the expulsion of refugees. And there will be some reduction in freedom of opinion by cutting the subsidies for newspapers.\" </p> <p>In Vienna, I bought a copy of the Economist, because its cover story was about Europe's need for more immigrants. Because of the ageing of the baby boom generation, it stated, \"Europe's working population is falling, while Europeans' aspirations to do only clean, sedentary, well-paid jobs are constantly on the rise.\" It described a new sort of migrant, a \"labour tourist\", who shuttles \"resourcefully back and forth across an EU border, usually from eastern Europe into Germany and Austria, and often earns a living in the Union to support a family outside it.\" </p> <p>Economically, foreign workers are exactly what Europe needs but, to the Economist writer, this is being hampered by Europe's failure to adjust to being a continent of immigration, such as America or Australia, instead of a continent of nation states. Europe is currently desperate for workers trained in hi-tech skills, which India is now producing in huge numbers, but would-be emigrants are reluctant to go to Germany, where they are only offered short-term contracts with no right to bring their families. America pays more, and offers them and their families citizenship. </p> <p>The two men I bought the magazine from were victims of this myopia. They were immigrants from India. They had come 10 years ago on student visas to gain degrees in business studies, leaving their wives at home, and, like many non-white entrants to the country, had never been able to turn that initial entry into a work permit. One of them explained how the system operated: \"You apply for a job, and the boss of the company will give you a paper for the government labour office and they should give you permission to work, but a lot of people have been living here for up to eight years and every time they go to the government office, they say no, and this is much more common for Indians and Africans than for Yugoslavs.\" One of the anomalies of the new borderless Europe is that its non-citizens do not share the right to work in other EU countries. The two newspaper sellers were effectively resident in Austria, but not the EU. </p> <p>The only way they had found to earn a living was to work for a firm, which required them to take 100 copies a day of a newspaper called Kronen Zeitung, the country's most popular paper, similar in its appeal to our own Daily Mail. They were expected to sell 80 of these; if there was a shortfall, they had to pay for the unsold copies themselves. Being forced to sell Kronen Zeitung was a humiliation: \"The paper is always against foreigners. Every day there's more propaganda, and nobody talks about it, not the Social Democrats, not the Greens. They are always writing about Africans, saying they are drug dealers.\" Abuse and racist attacks from neo-Nazis wasn't the main problem. One of the men showed me the apartment rental ads in Kronen Zeitung and pointed out the line in almost every one that said, \"Austrians only\". They saw racism as sewn into the very fabric of the country. </p> <p>While we were talking, a man who was looking at Rolling Stone could no longer contain himself. \"In my opinion, Kronen Zeitung is a newspaper which manipulates everything, including photos,\" he said. He explained that recently the paper had run a picture of an anti-Freedom Party demonstrator hitting a policeman. A week or so later, it was exposed as the juxtaposition of two separate photographs. \"If you manipulate photographs and no one complains, what kind of a country is this?\" he asked.</p> <p>His name was Edward Boehler, he was 36, a veteran of the anti-Haider demonstrations, and he worked for an advertising agency. I asked him why people his age voted for the FPO. \"These are the new yuppies who are interested in their careers and not in immigrants,\" he said. \"They see themselves as the cool, clever people of the new century. They're not really interested in the roots of the Freedom Party. For them, it's the party that takes us very fast into the chic future. For myself, I would be very glad if in 10 or 20 years' time, Austria didn't exist any more. It's just a region. But I don't think many Austrians think this.\" </p> <p>In Britain, we are used to thinking of the right and the far right in a particular way: little Englanders, nostalgic for Britain's long-lost greatness, insular, conservative. In Austria, the reverse is true. Boehler's description of the FPO supporters' amputation of history helped me understand a puzzling conversation I'd had the night before over a drink in the area of Vienna known as the Bermuda Triangle, a maze of streets heaving with bars and restaurants, and full of the hip young people of Vienna, indistinguishable from their counterparts in London's Camden Town or New York's East Village.</p> <p>Here, I thought, I would hear the voice of young Austria, the anti-Haider forces who have led the demonstrations. So, sitting at a table outside the Casablanca bar, I asked the people at the next table, six old schoolfriends, all in their mid-20s, about Europe. They were all for it. They understood implicitly the advantage of being able to work and travel in other countries. Yet they confirmed that, politically, they were on the right and one of them, the most articulate, was an economics student who was sympathetic to the FPO. </p> <p>\"Haider says we must be newer,\" said Markus. \"The FPO is not racist. If they were, do you think I would have voted for them? It's a democratic party, and here in Austria we are a democracy. I know people who went to the demonstrations and it's their democratic right - in Austria, everyone has the right to say what they want.\" The other five nodded in agreement. The only girl with them said, \"If the FPO makes mistakes, they will not be in parliament.\" Once again, I understood how it was possible to build a party of the far right among people who consider themselves to be the same as their peers in other European countries, not special, or different, or secretly plotting a campaign for world domination. </p> <p>But what about the FPO's Nazi past? Had they studied the legacy of fascism in school? They all insisted that they had. As for the FPO, Markus pointed out, \"Most of the higher national socialists after the war went into the socialist and conservative parties. All the old Nazis were integrated without questions. It's strange, of course, but it's like in Russia with the communist party [some of whose members are now in government], and it was the same with us in 1945.\" When they themselves raised the question of immigrants, it was the refugees from the former Yugoslavia that concerned them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,359076,00.html\">Read part two of 'Whose Europe is it anyway?' here</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> The subject</strong><br> Oil, acid, salt, pepper. Poured on to food and mixed. That's 99% of the salad-dressing story.</p> <p><strong> The basics</strong><br> The word 'salad' comes from the Latin 'salata', literally meaning salted food. In practice, the salt was used with oil and vinegar (thank goodness). The word 'dressing' adds a different meaning: to dress food is to 'prepare it for use' (OED), and that's exactly what a dressing does for salad. It makes it edible -contrary to what is still believed in some backward-looking pubs and restaurants. </p> <p><strong> The details </strong><br> Dressing, as a cooking term (and in just about every other context), can be applied to many different substances and processes. In some parts of the US, stuffing is dressing. Preparing poultry for the pot is dressing. And so on. Salad needs its dressing for a different reason: without it, you've got a collection of unrelated pieces of food; with it, you've got a unified dish. And easy? Ha! Any passable seed, nut or vegetable oil - check. Any passable wine or cider vinegar - check. Salt and pepper - if you haven't got them , you're reading the wrong article. Dissolve salt in one unit vinegar (it won't dissolve in oil), then add three units oil. Grind in pepper. Mix. Pour on to the greenery, etc just before serving or the leaves will wilt. Toss by gently scooping to the bottom of the bowl, picking up leaves, etc, and letting them tumble back. If there isn't enough dressing, friction makes the leaves hard to toss. If there's too much, it forms a pool at the bottom of the bowl.

  "<p>Towards the end of last year there was a flurry of lists published identifying the most significant figures of the past century and millennium. Apart from genius, the other factor that united the distinguished roll calls; Shakespeare and Mozart, Darwin and Galileo, Marx and Newton, was that most of the listees were dead. A rare exception was Professor Carl Djerassi, whose name earned an impressively high share of mentions. </p> <p>Djerassi, a 77-year-old organic chemist, has indeed had a distinguished career. As a young man his name was on the patent for the first antihistamines, he subsequently undertook pioneering work in the area of pest control and the 1,200 papers he has published in academic and scientific journals detailing his ongoing work bear witness to an astonishing productivity. But his place among the pantheon of influence was based on a single piece of research conducted nearly 50 years ago in a laboratory in Mexico City. It was there, on October 15 1951, that Djerassi succeeded in creating a man-made version of nature's contraceptive hormone, progesterone, that could be taken orally. This was the birth of the pill and Djerassi would ever after be known as its father. </p> <p>\"Yes I am proud to be called the father of the pill,\" he now says in his soothing mittel-European drawl apparently unaltered by the 60 years he has lived in America since leaving Nazi occupied Austria. \"But identifying scientists is really only a surrogate for identifying the inventions or discoveries. Maybe it is true that Shakespeare's plays would never been written if it wasn't for Shakespeare. But I'm certain that if we didn't do our work then someone else would have come along shortly afterwards and done it.\" </p> <p>This month has seen the 40th anniversary of the commercial availability of the pill. The long-standing debate as to its social, sexual, cultural and economic impact has been re-energised and broadened to take in the ethical issues arising from medical advances in fertility. </p> <p>While it comes as no surprise that Djerassi, despite his apparent modesty, should energetically join in the debate on questions such as the male pill, abortion and the improved techniques for artificial insemination, the medium in which he chooses to do it is unusual. Although he does appear on the international lecture circuit and takes an innovative postgraduate class on ethics at Stanford University in California, for the past decade or so his primary activity has been as a novelist, memoirist and playwright. It is through fiction that he has chosen to take on the thorny moral and practical issues thrown up by his research half a century ago. </p> <p>Djerassi has never been a typical scientist. He made his reputation as a chemist, but he has also been an astute businessman. He is a serious collector of art and owns one of the most significant private collections of Paul Klee's works in the world. As an admirer of the writings of Aldous Huxley, in the mid 1950s he personally tested out Huxley's claim that mescaline should be the opium of the intellegentsia when he and two students undertook a mescaline trip during a picnic at his house. He funded a spectacularly failed feature film in the mid-60s and has, for the past 20 years, been a benefactor to more than 1,000 writers, painters, choreographers and sculptors at an extremely successful artist's colony he founded on his California ranch. </p> <p>\"He's a scientist, artist, philosopher and mensch all in one,\" says Stephen Jay Gould who claims that Djerassi's book, The Pill, Pygmy Chimps, and Degas' Horse, \"is the very best of scientific autobiography\". Iris Murdoch said his 1989 debut novel, Cantor's Dilemma, was \"a brilliant tale of the morals and politics of contemporary science. Exciting, moving and brilliantly written\". David Lodge praises not only the content of his fictional output, but also his achievement in writing it all. \"It is amazing that a man of his age who has had such a distinguished scientific career has turned to literature and is so determined to succeed.\" </p> <p>Djerassi's chosen genre is \"science-in-fiction\", which is very different from science fiction because of its scrupulous scientific accuracy. In Cantor's Dilemma, which has sold more than 100,000 copies in the decade since publication, he explores the complex layers of trust between scientific colleagues. His next novel, The Bourbaki Gambit, takes on the cult of youth and the craving for name recognition in science when four distinguished old professors shake things up by pooling their work and publishing under a false name. His 1998 book, NO, illuminated the workings of the commercial bio-tech industry in relation to a pre-Viagra impotence cure. \"In the novel I use the example of Muse, which was a real invention before Viagra,\" he explains. \"But I changed the name to Musa, which is the botanical name for the banana. I still think that would have been a better trade name,\" he laughs. </p> <p>While undoubtedly revelling in this \"intellectual polygamy\", Djerassi also claims it is just a practical response to the challenges he has set himself. \"The more different ways we have of teaching certain difficult things the better off we are. I think that we as scientists should educate the public about the scientific and technological advances so that society can decide how best to use them. This is my missionary obsession.\" </p> <p>He says that the idea that scientists should make moral or ethical decisions about these issues is fundamentally wrong. \"Just because you have won a Nobel Prize doesn't mean you're qualified to make these important judgments. Ethics is a social construct and is something that society should establish. But in order to make educated decisions about this you must be aware of it.\" </p> <p>Djerassi has said that the most fundamental affect the development of the pill had on him was to gradually shift his interest from the \"hard\" science undertaken in the lab to the \"soft\" science of thinking about the social conse quences arising from scientific and technological developments. </p> <p>\"It is already possible to choose the sex of unborn children,\" he explains. \"The sperm of recently deceased men can be used to fertilise an egg. A woman could preserve millions of eggs when she is in her early 20s for use when she is post-menopausal in her late 40s. There is so much going on and the most important three-letter word in this century will not be \"sex\" but \"but\". For all of the wonderful opportunities these advances will throw up there will always be a but. These are things that interest me and this is what I want to start a debate about. But they are all grey questions and I don't say things are right or wrong.\" </p> <p>David Lodge agrees that Djerassi's fiction doesn't have a specific didactic aim. \"But he does have an informational or a pedagogic aim,\" says Lodge. \"He sees fiction as a means of communicating information about science and its moral and ethical implications. There is an explicit programme to bridge the two cultures.\" </p> <p>Lodge says that this tradition in literature can be traced back to Plato's dialogues, in which the interaction of characters is used to explore philosophical or political problems. \"There is a long and honourable tradition of using fiction to explore ideas but I think that Carl would hope that his novels were rather more mainstream than that. He does aim to interest you in the plight of his characters; their weaknesses and desires and ambitions.\" </p> <p>Djerassi himself acknowledges that such concern with literary history and technique is an unlikely turn of events. If there was a plan for his life it was that he should become a Viennese doctor like his parents. He says now that without Hitler's intervention that was what he would have become, living a bourgeois life and probably even voting for Kurt Waldheim as president. </p> <p>He was born in Vienna in 1923. His mother was an Ashkenazi Jew and his father Sephardic, but he says that their home life was virtually non-religious and medicine was everything. His mother was a physician who became a dentist and his father, a Bulgarian, was a doctor who specialised in treating venereal disease in the days before penicillin. Djerassi's Barmitzvah had to be postponed when a new, and lucrative, syphilis patient presented himself at his father's clinic. </p> <p>Although he remembers his early years as prosperous and enjoyable - he attended the same school as Sigmund Freud - in fact, things weren't quite as they seemed. Djerassi's parents had actually divorced when Carl was six but he didn't know this had happened until his early teens. </p> <p>The first few years of his life were spent in Bulgaria so when he returned to Vienna to go to school he didn't really think it odd that he only saw his father when he came to Vienna or when the young Carl visited him during the summer. \"I suppose I was simply too young and generally too happy to wonder that my parents didn't live together\". The truth eventually emerged when his father was forced to introduce a girlfriend to his son. </p> <p>In a strange echo of this a quarter of a century later, Djerassi himself was evasive to his children about his own first marriage, to a woman whom he had divorced before he married their mother. He had left details blank in a Who's Who entry and been vague about dates but when he eventually told his teenage daughter the truth he was relieved that she was more fascinated than traumatised by the revelation. </p> <p>When the anschluss took place in April 1938 it was his father's Bulgarian nationality that saved Djerassi's life. His father returned to Vienna from Bulgaria, re-married his mother and, by July, had taken her and the 14-year-old Carl out of the country. As soon as they were safe the marriage was again annulled. Djerassi's mother went to England to arrange passage to America, while the young Carl stayed in Bulgaria where he learned English. </p> <p>He didn't return to Austria until the late 1980s. \"I have felt very ambivalently towards Austria for many years,\" he says. \"They seemed to refuse to come to terms with their past in the way that Germany did.\" </p> <p>Although he had received many awards and honorary degrees from around the world, it wasn't until a few years ago that he received a call from the Austrian consulate enquiring whether he would accept an award for culture and science. He says he gave it a lot of thought before agreeing. \"When I finally did return I took the opportunity to walk around the city alone and I realised how beautiful it was, and still is, and what an extraordinary cultural mixture it represented. But it was a very bitter-sweet experience.\" </p> <p>The journey from Vienna he began in 1938 ended in New York a year later. While his father stayed in Bulgaria, Carl and his mother arrived in America virtually penniless. \"But despite everything I knew that getting an education was vital. I knew that would be my union card.\" He therefore took the remarkable step of writing to first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, to explain his situation. His letter was passed on to the Institute of International Education and after a short spell in a high school in Newark he was offered a scholarship to a Presbyterian college in Missouri. By 1941, when he was only 17 and due to, \"some administrative subterfuge\" because he hadn't officially graduated from high school, he completed his chemistry degree in a single year at Kenyon College in Ohio before going on to do Post-graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. </p> <p>Gilbert Stork, a fellow organic chemist, was a contemporary at Wisconsin and recalls Djerassi's extraordinary determination. \"He had and still has the incredible ability to keep his eye on the goal,\" says Stork. \"I remember him having this skiing accident. He had to make the very difficult decision whether to have an operation to remove his knee. This was at a time when replacement parts were not very good but he didn't hesitate for a moment. And not only does he still walk faster than most people, he even got a ski instructor to give him a technique for what amounted to skiing on one leg. He was determined that he wasn't going to be stopped skiing by the minor matter of losing a knee.\" </p> <p>Djerassi has given considerable thought to the roots of his overwhelming determination. He describes himself a workaholic but adds that, \"I'm not proud of that. I have always had the feeling that there is not enough time to get everything done\". </p> <p>He says that up until 1985, when he was 62, death was very much a theoretical concept. \"I really considered myself immortal in the same way that most young people consider themselves immortal.\" He was then diagnosed with cancer of the colon. In fact, Djerassi's health has been reasonably good since then but the episode marked a sea-change in the way he lived his life. </p> <p>\"I took a long time to value human interaction and spontaneity. If a student said they wanted to speak to me I wouldn't say 'sit down'. I would say 'how long do you want to talk for?' and arrange a meeting in a few days. That is insulting. It took me 50 years to realise I wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of this treatment and now if I do it at least I apologise for doing it.\" </p> <p>He says that if there is a hormone that characterises the scientific life it is testosterone. He talks about the machismo of working long hours and craving recognition from your peers. In fact he was rare among his scientific colleagues in that he had some interests outside the lab and did do things such as go to the theatre occasionally. \"But the idea that scientists undertake science purely for science's sake is not quite right,\" he says. \"We are curious but it is not just curiosity. There is also the desire for rewards. It was the same for me as well. I have lots of degrees and awards but the fact that I did not have an award from Austria for science is something that, if I didn't exactly mope around thinking about it all the time, it was something I was aware of.\" </p> <p>This remarkable sense of drive propelled Djerassi through the early years of his career. After four years as a research chemist he joined the Swiss pharmaceutical company, CIBA, which was based in New Jersey. It was one of the original powerhouses in steroids chemistry and medicine. In 1949 he was made an associate director at Syntex in Mexico City. He says it was a bold move to go south of the Rio Grande but he felt it was right as both he and Syntex had the same goal - to establish a scientific reputation. This was initially achieved in the highly competitive field of cortisone research, which had significant impact on the treatment of arthritis. The original research into what became the pill was not initially concerned with contraception but with certain types of menstrual disorders and cancer. Other people had thought of the idea of using progesterone as a contraceptive but it would have required daily injections. </p> <p>Djerassi's triumph was to develop a synthetic contraceptive that could be taken by mouth. While still working at Syntex as president of research, in 1968 he founded his own firm, Zoecon. It developed novel approaches to insect control, the gist of which is summed up in a chapter in his autobiography called How Do You Get a Cockroach to Take the Pill. </p> <p>As the 60s ended so Djerassi became an increasingly public figure. He was open in his opposition to the government policy in Vietnam and made it onto the White House enemies list - as disclosed during Watergate - because of his involvement in Senator George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, which included serving as a delegate at Democratic convention in Miami. It was therefore an uneasy occasion for both sides when, in 1973, Djerassi was presented with the National Medal of Science by a somewhat distracted President Nixon, on the very day that Spiro Agnew, the vice president, resigned. </p> <p>Gilbert Stork says that Djerassi was ready and waiting for fame when it arrived. \"To a considerable extent he expected to be famous. If anything, I suspect he thought it was slower in coming than he could have reasonably expected.\" </p> <p>Along with the fame he also acquired a considerable fortune: not from his right to the patent for the pill, for which he was given only $1 by Syntex - \"that was the usual deal and I was and am entirely happy with it\" - but from his ownership of stock in Syntex, which became a huge Wall Street success story, and then Zoecon. An original Syntex share cost $2. By 1993 they were valued at $8,000. He bought a large ranch near San Francisco which was called Smip - Syntex Made It Possible - and his collection of art swelled with works by the likes of Giacometti, Picasso, Henry Moore and Degas. \"I liked to collect painters who were also sculptors. I was always interested in people who don't just work in one area.\" </p> <p>But while he was increasingly professionally successful, his domestic life, already troubled, was about to be shattered. He had met his first wife when they were both at college at Kenyon and married her when he was a 19-year-old virgin. The marriage had ended after six years in 1949 when Djerassi moved to Mexico and asked for a divorce to marry Norma Lundholm, who was pregnant with Pamela, his first child. Ironically for the father of the pill, the pregnancy resulted from a broken condom.</p> <p> After his son, Dale, was born in 1953 he had a vasectomy. His mother's extreme possessiveness and repeated threats of suicide had been a contributory factor in the failure of his first marriage. When her behaviour threatened his new relationship he broke off contact with her, although he continued to support her financially. She returned to New York and resumed medical practice in a hospital. He didn't see her again until many years later, when she was suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease and did not recognise him. His relationship with his father, who came to live in America in 1949, was much better. From then until his death aged 96, they occupied neighbouring seats at the San Francisco opera. </p> <p>Carl Djerassi's marriage to Norma ended in 1976 and he is now married to the Stanford literature professor and biographer, Diane Middlebrook. Dale Djerassi is a film-maker who produced the film '68 with his then wife Isabel Maxwell, daughter of Robert. Pamela Djerassi was an artist who lived on the Californian ranch with her husband. She committed suicide in 1978, when she was 28. </p> <p>\"It was obviously the greatest tragedy of my life,\" Djerassi says. \"I wanted to mark her life by producing something living out of her death. Not a building or a statue.\" His response was to turn Smip - now named Sic Manebimus in Pace (\"Thus We'll Remain in Peace\") - into an artists colony. </p> <p>The area was very important to Pamela and, when hiking at the ranch with her, they used to stop at a beautiful small waterfall. He told his daughter this is where he would want his ashes scattered, never dreaming that this is where he would scatter hers. </p> <p>\"When I go to the ranch now I do think that this wouldn't have happened if Pamela hadn't died. Of course, that doesn't make it a good thing that she died, but at least something positive came out of it.\" </p> <p>The writer Vikram Seth and the composer John Adams, among many others, have passed through the colony. Alan Hollinghurst, the novelist, stayed there for a month while starting to write his novel The Folding Star. \"It's an extraordinary place. You travel down this terrifying route called Bear Gulch Road and you do feel you've gone into another world... Djerassi has a benign, but slightly remote presence at the ranch.\" </p> <p>The other thing Djerassi did after his daughter's death was to sell off the bulk of his art collection. \"It was very traumatic but I am now glad that I did it. I know now that physical possessions are far from being the only thing that matters. I realised I could do nothing for dead artists. But with an artist's colony I could support living artists.\" </p> <p>He has become a significant patron to many artists and a generous benefactor of art. The large Bill Woodrow sculpture in the lobby of the new British Library, of a massive book that is also a bench, was donated by Djerassi, who has a flat in Maida Vale in London and spends every summer here. </p> <p>He continues to collect work by Paul Klee, whose art was being vilified by the Nazis at about the same time as Djerassi was being forced to leave Austria. Most of the collection is now housed in a special gallery at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the museum will inherit the entire collection when Djerassi dies. Heather Whitmore Jain, the curatorial associate at SFMoma, looks after the collection. \"What is very interesting are the similarities between Djerassi and Klee. They are both renaissance men. Klee was obviously a very creative artist, but his art is so varied and he had this scientific and methodical side to him. For instance he systematically numbered all his work and Djerassi seems to share that combination of creativity and methodicalness.\" </p> <p>Throughout the time Djerassi was working in the commercial sector he also maintained an academic career. He was a professor at Wayne State University in Michigan and, in 1959, took up his current position as professor of chemistry at Stanford. He says he intends to be the first working professor aged 100. \"I've got a chance. My father didn't die until he was 96 and that was in an accident.\" He had a fall after an exercise session. </p> <p>His intellectual exploration of the social ramifications of his work has influenced his teaching, both in terms of subject matter and approach. He encouraged his ethics students at Stanford to write short stories. He even persuaded the prestigious Nature magazine to publish a piece of fiction for the first time in its history when the students illustrated an ethical dilemma in a renga - linked paragraphs written by different people - story. Djerassi pulled off a similar coup when the equally prestigious Science magazine included dialogue from his play about artificial insemination, An Immaculate Misconception. Orla Smith was the editor at Science who commissioned the piece. \"What attracted me about the play was that it is scientifically accurate. He was discussing real scientific issues in a very interesting way.\" </p> <p>Djerassi says that the key issue in the 21st century will be sex in an age of mechanical reproduction. \"It will change the relationship between men and women in a very fundamental way. Sex and reproduction can be separated. One will be for recreation while the other will be done under a microscope.\" </p> <p>An Immaculate Misconception was directed on BBC World Service radio by Andy Jordan, who will direct Djerassi's second play, Oxygen, co-written with the Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Roald Hoffmann, for the radio station this year. Oxygen, which looks at the culture and behavioural characteristics of chemists through the eyes of the Nobel Prize committee, will be the first play to be staged at the prize-giving conference in Sweden next year. </p> <p>For someone who has operated for so long in such contentious areas Djerassi has sustained comparatively few personal or professional attacks. He says the only trouble he gets usually comes from fundamentalists of all persuasions who attend lectures billed as being by the \"father of the pill\". </p> <p>\"They expect me to be either a male chauvinist pig or a pill pusher - or both. But that is not me. I believe in a contraceptive supermarket where all sorts of contraception is available that fits with people's own personal and cultural and religious and whatever other requirements. What I don't like is other people telling them what they can and cannot use. </p> <p>\"I do have an opinion about abortion. I believe in a woman's right to choose. I dislike the way the debate has been characterised as pro-life and pro-abortion. The pro-life people tend to be obsessed with life before birth but pay very little attention to it afterwards. Quite often the same people who are against abortion are also against gun control and for the death penalty. I think it is impossible to make abortion illegal, so we should all work together to make it unnecessary,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But rather than say my opinion I prefer to present the arguments to people and let them debate it. That's where my genre of 'science in fiction' or 'science in theatre' has an advantage. I can enlighten people and leave a few questions in their mind. I have a motive in telling a story.
