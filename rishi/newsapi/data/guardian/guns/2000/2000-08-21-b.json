  "<p>Stelios Haji-Ioannou, owner of the budget airline EasyJet and self-styled consumer champion, has decided not to allow small investors to buy shares in his company. </p> <p>Mr Haji-Ioannou, who plans to float about 25% of EasyJet in the next couple of months, will offer shares only to institutional investors and not to the retail sector. </p> <p>The decision was taken because of fears of repeating the lastminute.com fiasco, in which thousands of small investors tried to buy shares in the online travel agency. </p> <p>Those applicants who did get shares were disappointed by the small allocations they received and then by the sliding share price. </p> <p>EasyJet executives believe too many people would be interested in investing in the company if shares were offered to the retail sector, leading to many investors holding relatively small stakes. </p> <p>Amir Eilon, a non-executive director of EasyJet who is advising on the float, said: \"We can't afford to run the risk of a lastminute.com experience.\" </p> <p>An open initial public offering would have meant that anyone could have invested in EasyJet, necessitating a ballot system for allocating shares. </p> <p>Sources point out that a \u00a3150m open flotation would see only \u00a320m worth of stock available to retail investors, thus limiting the number of shareholders, given the minimum \u00a31,000 stake, to 20,000. </p> <p>\"You have to give people a reasonable allocation and the problem with that is the number of people that you satisfy is far too small,\" said Mr Eilon, a former senior investment banker. </p> <p>The company has used the figure of 5.5m people flying EasyJet this year as an indicator of potential interest in investment. </p> <p>\"Even if you look at passengers as people who have indicated an interest in the company, versus the numbers who haven't, the numbers just don't add up\", Mr Eilon said. </p> <p>\"The problem is you can't satisfy enough people, even if you double the percentage [of EasyJet stock] available, so that's why we've decided to go institutional offer only.\" </p> <p>However, Mark Dampier, head of research at the stockbroker Hargreaves-Lansdown, said: \"It seems very strange that a company that is the peo ple's airline has chosen not to address the people.\" </p> <p>Other companies with mass appeal have resorted to corporate \"handcuffs\" to ensure shareholders hang on to stock. Carphone Warehouse, which floated last month, offered retail investors an optional three-month \"lock in\" period in the company's recent intial offering, with a promise of a full allocation of stock. </p> <p>At least 90% of the 11,500 retail investors who applied for Carphone's shares took up the option, with a minimum application of 500 shares at 200p each. Retail investors who did not agree to the restrictions only got 60% of the shares they applied for. </p> <p>EasyJet is valued at about \u00a3600m but began business in 1995 with just \u00a35m of launch capital. </p> <p>The initial public offer, together with share options which will be made available to employees, will dilute the stake owned by Mr Haji-Ioannou and his family from 100% to just over 71%. </p> <p>Earlier this month Mr Haji-Ioannou announced he was planning to float his growing chain of 24-hour internet cafes. </p> <p>The internet business EasyEverything was valued at \u00a3100m after venture capital business Apax Partners and Hewlett Packard injected \u00a320m. </p> <p> <strong>The pitch that almost made Luton fashionable</strong></p> <p>In EasyLand everyone is equal. The orange huts at Luton airport that house EasyJet's operational headquarters bear no visible signs of hierarchy. Receptionists and chairman sit alongside each other in matching orange T-shirts. </p> <p>At the weekly company barbecues, founder Stelios Haji Ionannou is as likely to be serving the burgers as eating them. </p> <p>This folk hero for the underdog may have no intention of forgetting his staff - but the passengers who helped turn EasyJet into one of the success stories of the decade will not be allowed to buy shares. </p> <p>This seems to go against almost everything the 33-year-old has stood for since setting up with a \u00a35m loan from his shipping magnate father in 1995. </p> <p>Stelios' no-frills airline took advantage of airline deregulation and pitched at cost-conscious customers not travelling on company money. </p> <p>The service cuts out travel agents and almost 80% of flights are booked on the web. At check-in, passengers quote a reference number, are given a laminated reusable orange boarding card and make a dash for one of the unallocated seats. </p> <p>EasyJet now flies 28 routes to 18 destinations in Europe on one of the industry's newest fleets. In the next few weeks it will start taking delivery of 15 next generation Boeing 737-700s. </p> <p>Stelios stood up to SwissAir's attempts to muscle him out of the Geneva to Barcelona route and argued that Go, its budget rival, is unfairly subsidised by BA. </p> <p>Visitors to EasyJet.com are greeted with a banner screaming: Stop Barclays increasing your airfares by \u00a35 - a reference to the high street bank's desire to increase landing charges at unfashionable Luton airport in which it has a 25% stake. </p>",
  "<p>The mounting concern in regulatory circles about the power of the internet to move share prices was underlined yesterday when two financial news websites were told that it is illegal for them to reprint share tips from newspapers. </p> <p>The financial services authority has told the companies that they are not permitted to reprint the share tip information because they are not registered financial advisers - even though newspapers do not have to abide by the same rule themselves. </p> <p>Newspapers and magazines are exempt from the restriction as investment advice is not their primary purpose, an FSA spokeswoman said. </p> <p>The clampdown comes as the FSA is seeking to clarify its position on a range of internet-driven financial information sources including bulletin boards and chat rooms, which have at times been abused by rogue share promoters. The FSA is expected to outline its feelings in the autumn. </p> <p>Sharepages.com and Digitallook.com both said yesterday that they had suspended publishing round-ups of weekend newspaper tips at the request of the FSA. </p> <p>Several other leading financial news websites said that they had not been contacted by the FSA but would fight to keep their tips summaries as they were merely repeating information that was already in the public domain. </p> <p>\"It seems bizarre that we are forbidden from merely repeating information that is already widely circulated, especially since we are not altering, interpreting or commenting on it,\" said Sharepages' managing director, Marc Pinter-Krainer. </p> <p>\"We have suggested ways that the law could be modified but at present we haven't been able to reach a positive outcome,\" Mr Pinter-Krainer said. </p> <p>Digital Look said it would now only publish the name of the stocks tipped and provide a link to the relevant newspaper website. </p> <p>The FSA was at pains to emphasise that it was not \"anti-internet\", and said that it was working with the Treasury on ways to update legislation so that it took into account how the internet was changing the way in which people buy shares and find out information about companies. </p> <p>Rules governing the newspaper exemption were drawn up in 1986 - long before the internet became a mass phenomenon. </p> <p>\"It wouldn't matter if the tips were written on the back of an envelope or on the internet, the law prevents those not registered as financial advisers from making stock recommendations,\" the FSA spokeswoman said. </p> <p>\"This is all about protecting the consumer. We are looking at ways of making regulation technology neutral.\"</p>",

  "<p>All that changes at the Premiership's largest place of worship is the size of the congregation. Yesterday Old Trafford's biggest crowd for 64 years watched Manchester United pick up the thread of success with the air of men who did not intend dropping any more stitches this season than they did last. </p> <p>The latest expansion of United's stadium has raised its capacity to 68,000 and yesterday's attendance of 67,477 was last exceeded for a match against Manchester City way back in 1936. That was the year of the abdication but as Sir Alex Ferguson's side first sped then strolled past Newcastle United there was no sign whatsoever that a similar thought had occurred to the champions for six of the last eight seasons. This crown is not on offer. </p> <p>Before now Manchester United, like Liverpool in their title-winning days, have been known to start a new season looking a little hungover from the previous campaign. Yesterday, however, Ferguson's players moved with the speed and perception of men for whom the task of prolonging their near-monopoly of the Premiership had not come a moment too soon. </p> <p>While Newcastle, revived by Bobby Robson last season following the fall of Ruud Gullit and a dangerous flirtation with relegation, showed considerably more determination than they had done in losing 5-1 at Old Trafford a year earlier, their defeat would have been equally heavy but for the goalkeeping of Shay Given and the opposition calling it a day once they had taken a 2-0 lead. </p> <p>Certainly Robson knew the truth of it and virtually admitted as much. \"Manchester United had better movement and better quality,\" he said. \"Really, they played quite beautifully. They're just a class act. If my players needed to see the sort of team we want to become then they've seen it today.\" </p> <p>So far as Manchester United's football in the first half was concerned this was fair comment. Ferguson hopes that this season Ryan Giggs, now 26, will embark on the golden age of an already glittering career and to judge by the way the Welshman consistently ran at and past defenders a similar thought has occurred to Giggs. </p> <p>With Andy Cole at his industrious best, Roy Keane omnipotent in midfield and Jaap Stam taking advantage of the more assured presence of Ronny Johnsen alongside him to make several surging runs from the back, United steadily rolled back Newcastle with passing and movement of a familiar but still exceptional quality. </p> <p>On his own admission Robson employed a sweeper system \"with the idea of getting a 0-0 or a 1-1\". The trouble was his three central defenders were too sluggish as a unit to cope with the swift interchanges of passes and positions which are the champions' stock-in-trade. </p> <p>Yet when Manchester United did take the lead after 20 minutes the goal came from a simple set-piece involving little subtlety, just routine opportunism from a centre-back. First Stam was granted a free header as he met a corner from David Beckham on the right with a brisk nod which saw Given arch back to touch the ball over the crossbar. Another corner, from Beckham on the left, found Stam distracting the Newcastle defence, leaving Johnsen to produce a header which Given this time could only help into the net. </p> <p>A rich vein of football from Ferguson's team followed. Ten minutes before half-time Giggs, half-stumbling as he gained possession on the left, began a multi-passing movement which ended with his shot striking the foot of the near post after Paul Scholes had laid the ball in from the right. </p> <p>While all this was happening Fabien Barthez, the goalkeeping Marshal of France signed by Ferguson in the hope that he will prove the real successor to Peter Schmeichel, was all but a spectator in his first home match as a Manchester United player. None of Newcastle's finishing seriously tested his capabilities and Barthez's most impressive contribution came from the length and accuracy of his clearances. \"He can,\" as Ferguson observed, \"play through-passes from the edge of his own box.\" </p> <p>A goal down at half-time, and with little prospect of drawing level, Robson replaced Alain Goma with Kieron Dyer clearly in the hope of giving Alan Shearer a modicum of support in his lone struggle against Stam and Johnsen. Carl Cort, Newcastle's \u00a37m summer signing from Wimbledon, showed some useful touches at the start and the willingness of Daniel Cordone, the Argentine signed on loan from Racing Club, to join the attack briefly disturbed United but that was all. </p> <p>Newcastle's best chance of at least extending Manchester United a little more in the second half came when Nolberto Solano, who had just come on for Robert Lee, appeared near the right-hand byline on the hour. Shearer was in space near goal but the Peruvian failed to get the ball to him. </p> <p>Manchester United should have acquired the comfort of a second goal earlier than they did. Given kept out a cross-shot from Beckham and then had to move quickly to spare Nikos Dabizas the embarrassment of an own goal after the Greek had intercepted a cross meant for Cole with a header Cole could hardly have bettered. </p> <p>After 63 minutes Cole fed a return pass to Giggs whose cross was intended for Teddy Sheringham but instead found Cole heading over from an awkward angle. Never mind: six minutes later Cole worked another one-two with Giggs and this time scored sweetly. </p> <p>An impressive start by Manchester United then, although their mettle remains to be tested more rigorously by more likely rivals than Newcastle United, not to mention the Champions League. Yesterday an old foe, Eusebio, presented life achievement awards to Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best. As if Newcastle did not have enough to cope with.</p>",
  "<p>Motivating highly paid players to perform in a league which is hyped to the hilt and where staying up is deemed even more important than surviving Big Brother should not be difficult. On this evidence, though, Joe Royle still has work to do, while Alan Curbishley should be giving masterclasses. </p> <p>Charlton's four-goal romp on their return to the Premiership, against an insipid Manchester City, was a lesson to their more-fancied rivals that heart and passion still count for much in the frenzied environs of the top flight. Sublime skills were at a premium on Saturday and, while Charlton rose to the occasion, City froze. </p> <p>Curbishley insisted afterwards that simply being in the Premiership is motivation enough and Charlton will be trying their utmost to prove this result was not a fluke at Everton on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"If you ask my players what they missed most about the Premiership I'm sure to a man they would say 'the atmospheres, the packed houses, the players they are playing against',\" said Curbishley. </p> <p>\"When I wrote up on the board before the match that we were against Weah, Wanchope and names like that, that's what they want to be playing against. </p> <p>\"The Premiership is a whole new world compared to the First Division and that's what the players enjoy. Obviously the money's important as well but if you say to them Wednesday and Everton away, they will go 'Goodison, fantastic, packed house, Gazza, Ferguson, great'.\" </p> <p>Surely Walter Smith's side will give Charlton a stiffer test than City - it would be hard not to - and the excited throngs at the Valley will have been sobered by the thought they have been here before. Two seasons ago Charlton were top after two games having beaten Southampton 5-0; eight months later they were relegated. The Saints are the next visitors to the Valley. </p> <p>However, the true worth of Charlton's performance was not easy to assess given the paucity of the opposition. Each of the home side's goals owed something to inept defending, with the sluggish Steve Howey, a \u00a32m buy from Newcastle, looking like a startled rabbit whenever Kevin Lisbie, Charlton's seventh-choice striker, ran at him. </p> <p>Royle's motivational techniques, which have involved speakers and a sports psychologist in the pre-season, clearly failed on Saturday. \"Perhaps we weren't up for it as much as Charlton,\" said Alf-Inge Haaland. They appeared to still be in a different league. </p> <p>Lisbie had hit the bar and the impressive Claus Jensen seen a free-kick tipped over before Andy Hunt opened the scoring. </p> <p>The striker was fed by Jensen and rounded the static Spencer Prior and Richard Edghill before shooting past Nicky Weaver in the City goal. </p> <p>Lisbie, again, and Richard Rufus should have done better with clear headers before John Robinson doubled Charlton's lead, Weaver scuffing an attempt to clear his shot. </p> <p>Dean Kiely in the Charlton goal tipped a Paulo Wanchope header on to the post, but Charlton strolled to victory with Mark Kinsella coolly scoring the third with the outside of his right boot and Graham Stuart converting a penalty after Kinsella had been brought down by Weaver. </p> <p>\"We let ourselves down,\" said Prior, who could have a new central-defensive partner, Paul Ritchie, who completes his move from Rangers today, for Wednesday's home game against Sunderland. \"We are lucky we have still got 37 games to put it right.\" </p> <p>This was City's one consolation. They are back to square one this morning; Charlton are in the zone already.</p>",
  "<p>2pm: The sun's shining, in every possible way. \"We always win when it's sunny, win when it's sunny,\" sing the ecstatic Blues. Old songs are adapted for new glories. \"Weah on the march with Joe's army, Weah going to Wembley.\" Not only has the former world player of the year signed for the Blues, but he's a City fan. All those years ago, as a little boy in Liberia, he was shouting for Frannie and King Colin. City are back. </p> <p>2.55: Weah shakes hands with the players. Such style, such dignity, such respect. </p> <p>3.45: \"It'll be all right!\" says Mark, who is teaching himself the art of positive thinking. \"How?\" asks bewildered Bill, a Blue who has sneaked into the ground disguised as a photographer. We're 2-0 down, playing worse than our worst nightmares. The defence is non-existent. So is the midfield. Weah seems to be out for a late summer stroll before retirement. </p> <p>4.45: 4-0. Bloody Blues, bloody football, bloody life. Since when was hope a crime. I feel like a Watford fan. \"We are top,\" shouts one of their lot. Yeh, and you know where that leaves us. </p> <p>5.15: Joe admits we were poor, that there was no understanding, but what can you expect when four players are making their debuts. Ah, so that's why Weah was shaking hands - he'd never met any of the team before. Joe says City could have had three penalties, and we get the giggles. Nice try, Joe, a shocker might have summed it up best, though. </p> <p>6.0: On the train an elderly chap who looks as if he's spent the afternoon on the bowling green asks if we're all right. \"Not really,\" says big Jeff. \"Fookin' Blues,\" says the elegant gent. \"Every fookin' time. Just when we begin to fookin' believe in ourselves, splat. Exactly the fookin' same in fookin' '37. Always been a Jekyll and fookin' Hyde team. Won the fookin' championship and went down the year after.\" </p> <p>Big Jeff starts singing the surreal song of denial from the bad old days: \"We are not, we're not really here.\" Only this time he's singing \"We-ah, We-ah not really here.\" Well, it is five years since he was world player of the year, and whatever happens he's still a Blue. </p> <p>7.0: The inquest. We air our grievances. \"Why was Joe wearing a leisure shirt and slacks rather than a suit,\" asks Johnny Brice. \"Gives the wrong impression.\" Come to mention it, why did he say to the reporter that it's only a game? </p> <p>\"The worst thing is they didn't look like they cared,\" says Mike, a gentleman with murderous thoughts about Richard Edghill. Anything positive? \"Wanchope,\" says Johnny. \"Then again I'm worried about the way he postures at the crowd... a bit Premiership, a bit big-time.\" </p> <p>Other positives. If we lost every game 4-0 this season, we'd still be a division better off than we were two seasons ago. And it's only a couple of weeks back that the august seer, Kevin Keegan, tipped us as title contenders. Then again, maybe we'll forget that. </p> <p>\"We won't play as bad again all season, that's for sure,\" says Mark, but we're not so sure he's sure. On the way home I shut my eyes and pretend it's Saturday morning, but all I can see is big Jeff getting off the train a couple of hours back. \"Got to laugh haven't you,\" he said, with a tear in his eye, before taking two fingers, making an imaginary gun and shooting himself in the head. City till I die.</p>",
  "<p>When these sides met in last year's Worthington Cup, rival fans chanted \"Boring, boring\" at each other. On Saturday they did not. That cup semi-final must have been bad. This was the cream of Midlands football. Already it tastes sour. </p> <p>The match was full of good prospects - Peter Taylor's first game in charge of Leicester, Stan Collymore's return against the last club to misunderstand him, the predictable fitness of Neil Lennon (and Gerry Taggart) after withdrawal from Northern Ireland's midweek game, debuts for Villa by David Ginola and the Turk Alpay Ozalan, who sounds like a cure for depression; he could be useful. </p> <p>Instead Robbie Savage seized the spotlight early, set the mood and soon they were all playing like savages. It was the law of the jungle with no clear path through and hacking the only way, desperate more than dirty. Only when the ball was with Paul Merson or Muzzy Izzet did there seem to be light. They consistently found space and team-mates but were often obliged to turn back for want of options from formations more 5-3-2 than 3-5-2. </p> <p>Closing down was top priority, so Ginola got little look-in, a testy booking and only an hour to play with. The attacks were less of a lessness. Dion Dublin should have hit the target with two late headers over. Collymore and Ade Akinbiyi are short of understanding. But Akinbiyi disconcerted with his pace, first leading to a cross that Collymore met unconvincingly, later going clear and blasting David James into action. </p> <p>James was last seen flapping the Cup to Chelsea at Wembley. Now he was clad in silver, which was fine for that save, embarrassingly eyecatching when he came for a cross that Collymore beat him to without the power to score. Collymore lacks match sharpness. </p> <p>Taylor felt Villa's tougher pre-season, going out of the Intertoto Cup, showed; so he was \"pleased with a point\". He started last season, his first at Gillingham, with two defeats, then three draws, and ended it in promotion. But he needs Steve Guppy for skilled width. </p> <p>Villa, too, need enlightenment. John Gregory received a driving ban last week. Chastened could turn to beleaguered if they do not show better against Chelsea and Liverpool. Though Gareth Southgate showed no lack of commitment, too many players in a squad from one to 40 (Matthew Ghent) failed to escape in the summer. </p> <p>It all amounted to a joyless game, which paid no heed to the reminder from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to \"kill speed and reduce carnage\". December's return match could aptly be sponsored by The Priory.</p>",
  "<p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger could not believe his eyes. \"If Sunderland can win games after being dominated like that they will win the championship,\" he said. </p> <p>If Arsenal fail to be more incisive and Patrick Vieira fails to control his frustration there is as much chance of the title coming to Highbury as there is of \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman becoming prime minister. </p> <p>Had Arsenal won by three goals few could have argued. Yet for all the visitors' superiority, there were signs of vulnerability as well. And not just in poor finishing which suggested several players, notably Ray Parlour, spent the summer studying the video \"Chris Sutton: the Chelsea Year\". </p> <p>The ponytailed David Seaman proved he is no Samson by gifting Niall Quinn the decisive goal, while Vieira's swipe at Darren Williams in the final minute confirmed his monumental talent continues to be undermined by his temperament. It provided the fifth red card of his Arsenal career and the 30th of Wenger's time at Highbury. </p> <p>Of course the closer Vieira keeps to Roy Keane in the disciplinary points table the less likely Arsenal are to keep pace with Manchester United in the Premiership. With Emmanuel Petit gone, Vieira is more than ever the fulcrum of his team's midfield. In his absence, probably for three matches, Wenger will most likely pair Parlour with Gilles Grimandi. After the Petit-Vieira axis that lacks a certain je ne sais quoi . </p> <p>Throughout the first half in particular, Vieira played with an unparalleled authority. Yet the 24-year-old's reaction to Williams' fouling hinted that Sunderland's fierce, niggling approach could bear fruit for others against Arsenal. </p> <p>\"People pay to watch football not to see people break attacks down,\" Wenger said angrily. \"We tried to go forward and were repeatedly held back. Referees have a responsibility to get that out of the game. Patrick has tried to play football and some others have not. In the end he is sent off for a bad reaction. It's unbelievable.\" </p> <p>Sunderland's manager Peter Reid felt Vieira was \"desperately unlucky\" to go, yet when will the Frenchman curb his tendency to seek retribution when he feels unprotected by officials? His forearm swipe at Williams may have been, in Wenger's words, a \"natural reaction\" to having his shirt tugged but it was not the right one. That it was born of frustration rather than malice was apparently a compliment to Sunderland. </p> <p>\"You've got to get compact and you've got to get in people's faces,\" Williams said. \"If you give the big teams time they can pass it forever, and they'll get people forward and break you down. You can end up losing by a lot of goals. </p> <p>\"Last season away from home we respected Arsenal too much and sat off a bit [and were beaten 4-1]. The manager and [his assistant] Bobby Saxton were saying we had to get up against them.\" </p> <p>Williams, not surprisingly, rebuffed Wenger's accusation that he tried to get Vieira sent off. The Arsenal manager claimed the referee Steve Dunn had been \"very naive\", though those words seemed more applicable to Vieira. Raise an arm to an opponent's face and you can have few complaints at being sent off. Vieira's more controlled work since his spat and spit at West Ham last October has been undone. </p> <p>Long before Vieira's dismissal Arsenal should have had the game won. Poor finishing and impressive keeping by Thomas Sorensen and his second-half replacement Jurgen Macho denied them. </p> <p>Although Wenger professed himself happy with the performance, he must be worried by Seaman's decline. Called on for almost the only time after 53 minutes the 36-year-old failed to claim Michael Gray's deep left-wing cross, allowing Quinn to head in. </p> <p>Seaman's increasing fallibility, coupled with the fact that Tony Adams cannot be expected to play every match, does not bode well. Arsenal's new signings Robert Pires and Lauren began on the bench, hinting that they will need time to settle in. And although Gilles Grimandi performed tidily he offers neither the driving force nor the vision of Petit. </p> <p>Grimandi, Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg are doubtful for tonight's visit of Liverpool but Wenger might settle for being outplayed and winning at Highbury.</p>",
  "<p>Stands the clock at 10 to 3? And is that a supermodel in row B? Thanks to global warming, exotic creatures are increasingly to be seen far from their traditional habitats. Not only that, they appear quite comfortable at latitudes that were once assumed to be hostile to them. </p> <p>Adriana Sklenarikova, Christian Karembeu's supermodel wife, did not make it here on Saturday but Alen Boksic already looks right at home in the Premiership. He has had an undistinguished time of it recently - the season before last he did not actually play a complete game for Lazio or Croatia - but he is still only 30 and appears little debilitated. </p> <p>On his Middlesbrough debut he laid on the first goal, scored the other two and should have been allowed a third. He has strength and pace and application, supposedly the staples of the English game, as well as intelligence, technical ability and a relentless eye for counter-attacking opportunities. Maybe he should have been over here all along. </p> <p>And this is not even the complete Boksic. The striker had hardly begun training with Lazio, because the Serie A season does not start until October. What will he be able to do when he is match fit? \"I will be an excited manager,\" said Bryan Robson, \"if he gets better than that.\" </p> <p>Robson said that he had been \"trying to bring in real quality players\" and on the evidence of this match he has had some success. Joseph-Desire Job has less experience than Boksic but showed a maturing appreciation of an unusual role, attacking wide on the right, and took his goal splendidly, getting on the wrong side of Marcus Hall and deftly placing his header past Magnus Hedman. And Karembeu, who is Real quality, looked outstanding in the hostile confines of an English midfield, even if he appears to be duplicating Paul Ince's work. </p> <p>Though Coventry ran the middle half-hour of the game, they have some catching up to do. They have lost their player of the season and their two leading scorers. In addition, Mustapha Hadji, Stephen Froggatt and Tomas Gustafsson are out injured and others have suffered an interrupted pre-season. Gordon Strachan's legendary equanimity was further tested 20 minutes from the end when David Thompson was sent off for a tackle on Ince that won the ball. </p> <p>Cheap red cards are an occupational hazard these days, along with over friendly supermodels. Karembeu met his on an aeroplane. There is hardly a check-in counter queue that is not decorated by the odd supermodel and her half-ton of Gucci luggage. </p> <p>Highfield Road, though, is resisting. At the end of this game steely-eyed stewards ringed the pitch, just in case Cindy Crawford had come for Colin Hendry.</p>",
  "<p>Catchphrase, the long-running ITV gameshow, could hardly be described as cutting-edge television. A badly drawn cartoon of a horse that has seen better days appears with \"for sale\" written over its head. The answer to this conundrum? Flogging a dead horse - and so it goes on for 30 frankly excruciating minutes. </p> <p> The programme, produced by Carlton's Action Time, is, however, at the vanguard of TV's attempt to engage with new technology. Catchphrase is one of a growing number of gameshows to produce faithful online versions which are proving increasingly popular and allow fans to play each other at any time of the day. </p> <p> The marketing men call it brand extension and enthuse about the cross-promotion opportunities. In the US, Uproar.com, which features a series of games including Family Feud (known here as the less adversarial Family Fortunes) and 100%, is one of the top 30 sites and among the top 10 \"stickiest\". </p> <p> While other TV formats such as drama or sitcom are struggling to grapple with what opportunities the internet or interactivity might present, the humble gameshow looks as though it could have been invented with the web in mind. </p> <p> But online versions of existing games are only the beginning. As digital technology becomes more widespread, viewers will be able to play along with contestants while watching the programme on TV. </p> <p> The gameshow genre, which had already been given a dramatic shot in the arm by Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, looks set to have its place in the schedules cemented and it is not only the likes of Millionaire or the \"psycho\" formats inspired by Big Brother that stand to benefit. Interactivity and online versions could breathe new life into formats that have been on air for years.</p> <p> \"This is a very exciting time,\" says Stephen Leahy, joint managing director at Action Time and a veteran of gameshows dating back to the Krypton Factor. \"I've been in gameshows for 25 years and they've suddenly become this modern currency instead of being the forgotten bit in the schedule. Millionaire has obviously had an effect, but it is also because gameshows are ahead of what other types of TV formats can do with interactivity.\"</p> <p> Pearson, the UK-based media company was sufficiently convinced by the potential to take an 11% stake in Uproar in return for licensing some of its most popular gameshows to the site. Pearson owns the rights to a raft of formats including The Price is Right, the aforementioned Family Feud, 100% and Matchgame, screened in this country as Blankety Blank. </p> <p> The online versions already up and running are made to replicate the TV experience as closely as possible using the same graphics, rules and sound effects. Prizes on offer range from cash to Amazon vouchers, widescreen TVs and telescopes. </p> <p> Martin Trickey, entertainment producer at Uproar, describes the phenomenon as \"the yelling at the TV screen thing. You want simple games that people are familiar with and ones that people get involved in\". </p> <p> Pearson hopes to launch an online version of The Price is Right towards the end of the year but, alive to the opportunity, is for the first time developing the game in-house as well as bringing the Uproar games to the UK site. </p> <p> A typical 15-minute game will be broken by a commercial break which Catherine Mackay, president of Pearson TV Enterprises, optimistically says helps to complete the experience that you are playing in the gameshow on TV: \"You are getting 3,000 people playing Family Feud online at any one time which says that gameshows work in that medium. Our online business looks as though it will be profitable in its first full year and these are all incremental revenues. We have 65 gameshow formats, so there is clearly a big opportunity here.\" </p> <p> The real prize for producers and the TV networks, though, will be the adoption of digital services by cable and satellite broadcasters which will allow people to play along. \"Gameshows will be a frontrunner in broadband,\" says Leahy. </p> <p> Two Way TV, which has pioneered the development of interactive technology, conducted gameshow trials using an analogue set-top box over a 12-month period in Birmingham in 1997. Deals were struck with all the major channels and interactive versions were produced of shows including University Challenge, Fifteen to One, Wheel of Fortune and Countdown. </p> <p> The aim again is to replicate the on-screen experience for the viewer playing along. You would either be able to play the rest of the country or simply the people in your living room, or the contestants on screen. </p> <p> Marjorie Curtis, head of marketing at Two Way TV, says the introduction of interactivity broadened the type of viewers tuning in during the trials. It seems a reasonable point. The chances are you've never appeared on a TV gameshow. When was the last time you can remember anyone who actually works in the media, for example, putting their wits on public display for Who Wants to be a Millionaire? or waving to the camera as he or she disappeared round the corner on Blankety Blank? </p> <p> \"Who would want to appear on one of those shows?\" says Curtis. \"But that doesn't mean you don't sit there thinking 'I knew that, the money should be mine.'\" </p> <p> Two Way TV claims that during the trials, viewing figures for the likes of University Challenge and Fifteen to One doubled with interactivity, while Play Your Cards Right went from 17% to just under 30% audience share. Cable company NTL recently took a 48% stake in the business and it has contracts in place to develop interactive facilities for both NTL and rival Telewest. Viewers should be able to play along with the games within six months. </p> <p> Two Way TV announced a number of deals, including one with Pearson which will add an interactive element to Fifteen to One, Family Fortunes, 100%, Strike It Lucky and Whittle. </p> <p> Viewers' willingness to play a behind the scenes part in gameshows has been demonstrated to rich effect by Big Brother which has invited people to vote contestants out and used the internet to provide a multi-layering effect. </p> <p> The latest in the UK is The People Versus which invites viewers to set the questions. Action Time has begun shooting the pilot of a show called Bankraid where viewers can get the profile of three potential contestants on the internet the previous day and then vote online who should take part. </p> <p> Millionaire has already proved that the gameshow format can become \"event TV\" again - not really the case since Anthea twirled for the last time. The ability to play along could mean that the effect will bleed out into less blockbusting shows. </p> <p> \"The fireside may not be back but you will get families plonked on the sofa playing these games together,\" says Leahy.</p>",
  "The crisis surrounding Scottish examinations deepened yesterday as headteachers called for schools to have the power to check every result amid allegations that some students' exam papers had gone missing. <p>A grim picture of chaos at the Scottish Qualifications Authority was becoming apparent as 3,000 of the students who have been barred from the university clearing process because of erroneous results learned they would have to wait even longer to get their grades. </p> <p>The authority confirmed yesterday that 2,000 of the 5,000 students known to have inaccurate or incomplete results would have their grades confirmed this morning, but that the remaining students would have to wait longer for their results. </p> <p>Pressure is growing on the Scottish education minister, Sam Galbraith, to resign. The minister, a close friend of Donald Dewar, is adamant that he will not pay for the outside agency's failings, but he may be unable to ride out the storm. </p> <p>Much of the crisis stems from what Mr Galbraith and the SQA euphemistically describe as \"missing data\". But it has emerged that the problems may have been compounded by the SQA's handling of teachers recruited as examination markers. </p> <p>These markers were not recruited until two months after the normal date, and the amount of teaching experience they were required to have was lowered from three years to two. </p> <p>It has been alleged that this, and a huge backlog of papers to be marked, led to chaos in the quality control system, with the normal system of checks and balances bypassed or badly compromised. </p> <p>Donald Matheson, president of the Headteachers' Association of Scotland, said he had grave concerns about the accuracy of some of the marking as anomalous results were double or treble what would normally be expected. \"We are calling for schools to be given the right to check papers,\" he said. </p> <p>Remarking and checking on a grand scale would add greatly to the cost and political impact of the crisis, but it might be the only way out. </p> <p>Already the SQA is bracing itself for a large number of appeals against grades, and the Scottish parliament's executive yesterday pledged to make additional resources available to cover the costs. </p> <p>At one school in Edinburgh, teachers alleged that the higher grade papers of 10 business studies students had been lost by the SQA. Frank Gestenberg, headteacher of George Watson's college, said the alarm was raised after pupils were given fail grades when they and the school expected a pass. \"The SQA has now told us the papers have been lost,\" he said. </p> <p>However, Bill Morton, interim chief execuitve of the SQA, denied the allegations. \"I can say to you categorically that that is not the case. Those papers are within the SQA,\" he said. </p> <p>It is certain that SQA officials were aware of the scale of the crisis long before it became public. More than two weeks after the deadline for marking, the SQA was forced to hire a bowling hall and recruit 100 markers in an attempt to tackle its backlog. </p> <p>Civil servants called in to sort out the quango's problems two weeks ago have confirmed to ministers that the organisation is in chaos. Ministers have known there were problems at the SQA since March, but they are only now learning the extent of the problem. </p> <p>Although the executive has promised to fund extra university places for every student disadvantaged by the debacle, some students have already contacted lawyers who say they would have strong grounds for suing the SQA for negligence.</p>",
  "Troops were ordered back on to the streets of Belfast tonight after two men were shot dead, the RUC said. <p>The two men were killed today as a loyalist paramilitary feud erupted in new bloodshed. One died immediately after a gunman opened fire on the city's Crumlin Road. The second was seriously wounded in the stomach in the same attack and died later in hospital. </p> <p>Offices used by political representatives of the rival organisations involved were also hit, one sprayed with gunfire and a second set alight. </p> <p>The two men were gunned down as they sat in a Range Rover outside a bookmaker's shop. </p> <p>Both had just walked across the road to the vehicle. Police said a lone gunman emerged from an alleyway and fired at them, then ran back down the alley. </p> <p>One of the murdered men had links with the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), which immediately blamed the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) for the shootings which signalled a dramatic escalation in the feud which has been simmering for several months. Both sides had earlier warned that people would be killed unless the fighting stopped.</p> <p>A taxi depot, at least one house and a car were also set ablaze, all in the Shankill area. </p> <p>Amid reports of armed UDA men roaming the area, two men were arrested and a number of weapons recovered. </p> <p>Within an hour the offices of the Ulster Democratic Party, the political wing of the UDA, were sprayed by a gunman who opened up from a passing car. ne man was slightly injured. </p> <p>Retaliation was swift. The offices of the Progressive Unionist Party, the UVF's political wing, a few hundred yards further along the Shankill Road were attacked by an angry mob and set on fire. </p> <p>RUC officers and gunmen later exchanged shots in the Malvern Street area. </p> <p>Violence erupted between the two sides in the neighbouring Shankill Road area on Saturday when seven men were injured after UDA gunmen twice sprayed a bar during and after a big loyalist paramilitary rally which they claimed was attacked by the UVF. Homes belonging to members and supporters of the Progressive Party were later attacked.</p> <p>Earlier today John White of the Ulster Democratic Party called for the appointment of a go-between to try to negotiate an end to the feud, but today's shooting is likely to quash hopes of an immediate truce.</p>",
  "Former M15 agent David Shayler was tonight released on police bail after being charged with two offences relating to disclosure in contravention of the Official Secrets Act. <p>Mr Shayler, 34, who was arrested at Dover port immediately on arrival in Britain this morning, was taken to Charing Cross police station for questioning following three years of \"political exile\" in France. </p> <p>Appearing after his release with his lawyer John Wadham, Mr Shayler said: \"I decided to return to Britain to face charges under the Official Secrets Act. </p> <p>\"I have done this to clear my name and to allow a jury of 12 of my fellow citizens to judge me. I have also returned to challenge the cover-up and complacency that has followed my disclosures.\" </p> <p> Mr Shayler said he is not being prosecuted for any allegations made after August 24 1997, which include his claims that MI6 were behind a bungled plot to assassinate Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi, and that the security services failed to act on a warning about the Bishopsgate bomb. </p> <p>He added that police had not questioned him on his allegations of the Gaddafi plot. He faces prosecution only over claims of incompetence by his former employers, MI5. </p> <p>\"The government is backing off. It doesn't want to fight. It is restricting its charges to what was in the public domain,\" Mr Wadham said.</p> <p>Mr Shayler said: \"The authorities want to restrict the charges to what was revealed in the Mail on Sunday in August 1997, but I wonder whether this is an attempt to prevent the jury from hearing the whole story.\" </p> <p> European human rights legislation, to be introduced in Britain this autumn, may provide a defence to \"whistle-blowers\" prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act.</p> <p>Mr Wadham said: \"The Official Secrets Act will have to read in a way that gives more respect to freedom of expression and the public interest in disclosure. </p> <p>\"David Shayler's case will test the extent to which this theory works in practice.\"</p> <p>Mr Shayler fled to France in 1997 after claiming in the Mail on Sunday that two MI6 officers were behind a failed attempt to assassinate the Libyan leader.</p>",
  "<p>Two months ago we were approached out of the blue by a major food corporation with an invitation to pitch for the publicity contract to launch a new type of frozen food. </p> <p>They said that they liked the PR work that we had done for Tango, and asked if we could bring some of that creative thinking to their product. Our first response was, predictably, to get very excited. If they were serious, it would mean a multi-million-pound advertising spend. The company in question is a household name and we would be working with real professionals. </p> <p>They refused to tell us any more about the project until we had signed a confidentiality contract. This meant we would be forbidden to talk about the product and their plans without their permission for all eternity. If we broke this agreement, we would have their lawyers to deal with. So we signed. If this was supposed to give us the impression that they were serious heavyweights, well, they succeeded. One of our team was dispatched to take the brief, face to face, along with three other wannabe PR agency hopefuls. </p> <p>When the details of the project arrived back at our office it was something of an anti-climax. The product was a peculiar variation on packaged food for busy people. It was frozen, but it was also fresh. And it was packaged in groovy silver foil to attract gullible 18-34-year-olds. </p> <p>We held a meeting and mulled it over. Someone suggested that we drop it and not bother getting involved. Our team of 14 consultants was busy enough on PR campaigns for Absolut Vodka, The Big Breakfast, Top of the Pops Magazine, American Airlines and S Club 7, without having to go chasing after new business. </p> <p>But I held firm. I was thinking greedily about how the brand name would look on our client list. I told the team that this pitch would challenge us, and that if nothing else, we would certainly learn from it. </p> <p>And so we had 10 days to prepare. Our first move was to pull in a freelance PR director - she cost \u00a3500 a day - and negotiate a chunk of her time to help come up with a strategy to win the business. </p> <p>Next we conducted an audit, talking to groups of consumers to put a sense of perspective around the product. Would people actually buy the stuff? How challenging was it? Where in the supermarket would it be sold? </p> <p>Another job was to create \"mood boards\". This entailed going through piles of magazines and newspapers to compile a picture of the target consumers' habits, how they shopped for food and how generally they lived their lives. By this stage we had analysed the brief to the point of knowing it off by heart. We had started to get an understanding of what might be needed to generate front-page news for the product. </p> <p>But still we needed more information. The brief was vague on some points and even contradicted itself. So we asked if we could talk to the advertising agency. They had been busy at work on the project for over six months. Unfortunately we were told, \"No.\" </p> <p>This was strange. Quite often, the advertising is more interesting and newsworthy than the product itself. Without the benefit of knowing what the advertising would be, we felt like we were shooting in the dark. </p> <p>Still, we ploughed on, and with four days to go we held another meeting to review our work. We decided to go for broke with an idea that had the potential to put the brand into every tabloid newspaper in the country. </p> <p>By the day of the pitch, our document was 52 pages long. We had created a series of elaborate tables and presentation boards. In a little under two weeks, we had completed a crash course in frozen-food marketing and PR. </p> <p>My wife had even started to contribute, waking me up in the middle of the night to tell me that she'd had an idea. The four of us loaded up the car and drove off down the motorway to the corporate HQ where the meeting was due to take place. </p> <p>Unfortunately the pitch did not live up to our expectations. It was a miserable affair. The product manager - a serious-looking woman in her late 20s - sat next to two corporate PR executives. Both of them were distracted because of a crisis elsewhere in the office. Apparently cod had just become an endangered species. Next to them was a smiling man from the advertising agency who was doodling on his pad. </p> <p>Our presentation took an hour and a half. We sold our ideas as if our lives depended upon it. No questions were asked. Our attempts at witty remarks were greeted by vacant expressions. </p> <p>At one point, desperate for some form of feedback, we asked them a question. It became apparent from the reply that they had not understood a word we had been saying. We were too embarrassed to make anything of it. </p> <p>As we crawled through the last set of ideas it suddenly occurred to me that we should stop the presentation, down tools, and walk out there and then. This sort of confrontation in a pitch scenario is always the kiss of death because most people - especially uncertain clients - hate being put on the spot. It means that they might have to think spontaneously and without being able to spend a month analysing all the issues. But I decided against it. We continued meekly laying our work out on the table in the hope of getting some sort of response. As we stood up to leave the product manager said to me, \"Thank you, John.\" She'd even forgotten my name. I asked them for business cards. They had none. </p> <p>We drove back to London with heavy hearts. It was obvious that the pitch had not gone well. The clients had had nothing to say about our ideas. But what started to rile me was their total lack of interest in what we, as outsiders, might think of their project. All we had faced was a wall of corporate stodge. They had been in an advanced state of analysis paralysis throughout the meeting. </p> <p>I began to feel angry. The rest of the team said that I was being unreasonable, that we had just taken the wrong tack, and anyway we might still be in with a chance. I said grumpily that I didn't want to work for them, even if we did win it. </p> <p>It came as no surprise when, two days later, we were telephoned and told that we had lost the pitch. No explanation was given. No thank-yous were offered for the time and effort that we had dedicated to the project. </p> <p>We held a debrief meeting and I asked everyone what they had taken out of the project. We all agreed it had been fun working as a team on something unusual like a new type of food. Someone said they were surprised at how boring the people looked at corporate HQ. </p> <p>In financial terms, it cost us \u00a32,000 in materials. We would also have charged around \u00a310,000 for the time that we put into the ideas and strategy. We have no protection against these ideas being used once we have presented them, though in this case it would seem unlikely. </p> <p>PR agencies and advertising agencies go through this process every day of the week as they punt for new business. To me this has started to seem like an outdated concept. Our world is about working with companies for mutual advantage, in exchanges of ideas and in cooperating to build networks that might bring shared benefits. </p> <p>Our clients understand this and our working relationship is built on trust and respect for each other, both as companies and as individuals. Though PR is an industry that is littered with intangibles, it is a place where great creative ideas can make a million pounds' worth of difference. </p> <p>I look at the experience of pitching to a corporation in this way and try to think what good it has done us.

  "<p>Fifty tonnes of depleted uranium is lying unmonitored in scrap heaps across Britain, posing a growing risk of environmental contamination and to workers, according to US government documents. </p> <p>The uranium was used as components in aircraft and hospital radiotherapy units and increasingly is left unregulated as the equipment is decommissioned. </p> <p>A US company has told British and American authorities that the uranium components have been accumulating in Britain \"in a multitude of dispersed locations, where they pose a growing risk of loss of control, personnel exposure and contamination of the environment\". </p> <p>The information was released under the US freedom of information laws but has been declared confidential by the environment agency and by the Department of Trade and Industry in Britain. </p> <p>The US firm, Philotechnics Ltd, has applied to salvage the uranium and recycle it where possible. It would not specify the use to which the recycled material would be put, but the Guardian has learnt that the company intends to pass it to another firm, which has produced equipment for the US department of defence. The unusable uranium would be buried at a licensed site in Texas. </p> <p>The most well-known military use of recycled depleted uranium is in tank-piercing ammunition. </p> <p>This is the first proposed shipment of the material out of Britain. There is no recycling or disposal route available in the UK, and airlines and hospitals are said to be increasingly concerned as the extent of the scrap emerges. Philotechnics said the scrap would mainly come from older British aircraft that use depleted uranium as counterweights to aid flight. </p> <p>The company said that while the aircraft were in service the depleted uranium in use was primed, plated and painted to prevent corrosion, but Donald Barbour, Philotechnics' aviation programmes manager, warned that after decommissioning it was \"highly probable\" the counterweights would release uranium oxides. These are toxic, and residual radioactivity causes cancer. </p> <p>British Airways said it had 11 Boeing 747s in service carrying these counterweights, but a spokesman said it had sold on all its decommissioned aircraft that carried them. </p> <p>Miles Warren, director of Active Collection Bureau, in Sittingbourne, Kent - where the first 20-tonne shipment will be gathered within weeks if the application is approved - said there would be many sources of scrapped uranium components. </p> <p>\"A typical scenario would be where a company has gone bust and the auctioneers clear it out and find an old source container on a pallet and shove it to the back of their garage,\" he said. \"Some hospitals didn't known they had depleted uranium in their radiotherapy heads. The equipment is often made so long ago that a lot of it has long been obsolete.\" </p> <p>Under Philotechnics' proposals the usable material would be transferred to the recycling specialists Manufacturing Sciences Corporation \"for inclusion in its production inventory\". </p> <p>Since 1985 MSC, bought by British Nuclear Fuels in 1997, has recycled 2,700 tonnes of depleted uranium into more than 70,000 products, including aircraft and machinery counterweights, flywheels, radiation shielding for x-ray machines and spent fuel casks.</p>",
  "<p>A government appointed regulator which polices the probity of \u00a3280m in tax credits given to thousands of UK environmental bodies paid its directors over \u00a3100,000 in fees for two years without authorisation, documents passed to the Guardian reveal. </p> <p>Entrust, the only private regulator, was set up by the Conservatives in 1995 to oversee financial probity of landfill tax credits, donated by the waste industry for environmental projects. The regulator has since barred five environmental bodies from the scheme, and two are under investigation by the serious fraud office over an alleged \u00a35.1m fraud. </p> <p>The Guardian is to pass details of the unauthorised fees to the Commons environment committee, which is to reopen its inquiry into the landfill scandal, after the paper's investigations and a Channel 4 Dispatches programme on illegal dumping and alleged misuse of the landfill tax credit scheme. </p> <p>Entrust's original memorandum of association did not allow salary or fees to be paid to its chairman or directors. Yet for the first two years the accounts show that Lord Cranbrook, the chairman, took fees of \u00a317,863 and \u00a320,200. Other directors took \u00a365,000 between them for the first year and \u00a319,807 for the second. </p> <p>In May 1998 the regulator held an extraordinary board meeting and the ruling was reversed to give retrospective authorisation to cover payments. </p> <p>Richard Sills, chief executive of Entrust, confirmed that the payments would have been considered ultra vires under government law but \"they were procedurally correct by measures taken in full conformance with company law\". </p> <p>He said: \"In the first difficult year of operation, the chairman and directors deferred all fees/salary due to them, so any incompatibility did not come to light. As soon as the anomaly was appreciated, legal advice was sought and appropriate remedies applied under company law, so that directors could be fairly rewarded for their services.\" </p> <p>The environment committee's reopened inquiry will be part of a wider investigation of the government's new waste initiative. The inquiry will look at the planned increase in incineration, waste recycling and better management of the disposal of hazardous waste. MPs have asked for written evidence by September 18. </p> <p>At the same time Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, will report to the Commons public accounts committee on whether action should be taken to tighten the landfill tax credit scheme. This committee has the power to summon customs and excise, which oversees Entrust, to appear before it. </p> <p>Copies of a 10,000-word report on the situation are being sent by the Guardian to Michael Meacher, environment minister, Richard Broadbent, chairman of customs and excise, Sir John Bourn and Andrew Foster, controller of the audit commission.</p>",
  "A man shot dead in Belfast today may have been the victim of the escalating feud between rival loyalist paramilitary gangs. He was gunned down outside a bookmaker's shop on the city's Crumlin Road. <p>A second man was also hit and was taken to the nearby Mater Hospital suffering from wounds to his stomach. </p> <p>According to unconfirmed reports, the dead man was linked to the Ulster Defence Association which is involved in a bitter feud with the Ulster Volunteer Force. </p> <p>Both sides had earlier warned that people would be killed unless the fighting stopped. </p> <p>The dead man was sitting in a car outside the bookmaker's shop when he was shot. The wounded man may have been hit up to four times, according to eyewitnesses. </p> <p>Violence erupted between the two sides in the neighbouring Shankill Road area on Saturday when seven men were injured after UDA gunmen twice sprayed a bar during and after a big loyalist paramilitary rally which they claimed was attacked by the UVF. Later homes belonging to members and supporters of the Progressive Party, the UVF's political wing, were attacked. </p> <p>Earlier today John White of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UDA's political wing, called for the appointment of a go-between to try to negotiate an end to the feud, but today's shooting is likely to quash hopes of an immediate truce.</p> <p>Last night Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, called for an RUC report into the spate of incidents in loyalist areas of Belfast and appealed to loyalist paramilitaries to end the violent attacks and the destruction of property.</p> <p> His intervention came after Adam Ingram, the Northern Ireland security minister, met the RUC deputy chief constable, Colin Cramphorn, and senior security advisers to discuss the worsening situation of sectarian violence.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Gilruth, who has died aged 86, was the architect of the American manned space programme. He was given the job in 1958, when made head of a newly created space task group. Gilruth went on to direct the selection and training of the US astronaut corps from the flight of the first American in space - Alan Shepard in a Mercury capsule on May 5 1961 - through the Gemini programme to the Apollo moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, in July 1969.</p> <p> A brilliant engineer and administrator, Gilruth also had immense political acumen. While they were shaping the US manned space programme, his task force had to resist immense pressures from the military and science lobbies, which wanted to impose their agendas on the way space exploration was developed. </p> <p> Although he was one of the most powerful figures in the US aerospace business for 30 years, Gilruth was a reticent man, with little by way of a public persona. He directed the astronaut corps through an authoritarian if paternalistic management style at the manned (later renamed Lyndon B Johnson) space centre at Houston, until he retired in 1972. </p> <p>While many astronauts, flight directors and rocket-design scientists such as Werner von Braun became household names as they basked in the limelight after successful flights, Gilruth stood back puffing his cigar or pipe when the hurrahs hit the rafters. It was typical that one of his greatest achievements, but one of the least well known, was a test he invented in 1944 to discover what would happen to an aircraft or guided missile if it exceeded the speed of sound.</p> <p> In the world of aeronautics there was a desperate need for data on what to expect with supersonic flights. There was little knowledge, because existing wind tunnels would not work in that area. His technique, called the wingflow test, was made on flights with special models. It was top secret for three years; the only published description came in a paper that Gilruth delivered in 1947 to the Royal Aeronautical Society, in London. </p> <p> Gilruth was also the man who told President Kennedy how the United States could regain public recognition as the world leader in technology, which had been lost when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. He argued the case for a project so difficult and new that the Russians would have to start from scratch because the goal could not be achieved with existing rocketry. Gilruth predicted that the US could win such a race in a project such as going to the moon. A huge step in the power of rocket technology would be needed, and he believed the US could win that competition if the two countries had to start from scratch. </p> <p> Gilruth was born in Nashwauk, Minnesota. At an early age he read magazines such as American Boy, making model aeroplanes from the sketches it carried. He graduated to Popular Mechanics, with its more advanced articles on model planes, which stimulated a fascination with aeronautics. In his mid-teens, he made telescopes to watch the planets and stars.</p> <p> In a rare interview, Gilruth said he wasn't a very good student until he went to college for two years; the University of Minnesota offered one of the few courses then available in aeronautical engineering, from which Gilruth graduated in 1935. He was already interested in the work of the national advisory committee for aeronautics (Naca) - predecessor of US space agency Nasa, the national aeronautics and space administration - but between 1933 and 1935 the funds for Naca were in sharp decline, so he got a scholarship to stay at Minnesota to do research in aeronautics. </p> <p>Gilruth's attention turned to studying the properties of materials, the effects of heat treatments and corrosion, and how to make things durable and strong. Flying machines were plagued with many problems with materials. The challenge was to discover how to design these highly stressed complex structures that had to be very light and safe. His knowledge of materials science proved invaluable when he was running the space programme - materials problems were one of its greatest recurring headaches.</p> <p> In 1937 he at last got a job with Naca, leading research work that used rockets to test the dynamics of vehicles at supersonic speeds; and in 1945 he organised an engineering team to investigate rocket-powered aircraft. Gilruth recalled how he had watched sunlight reflected off the first Sputnik, launched by the Soviet Union on October 4 1957, as it passed over his home in Virginia. </p> <p>A month later, when the dog Laika was placed in orbit in Sputnik 2, speculation about Soviet plans for putting a man in space turned to certainty. The official response by the United States came on October 7 1958. Gilruth was called into the office of T Keith Glennan, administrator of the just-created Nasa, and told to assemble a task force with the job of getting men in to space. He handpicked a team of fewer than 10 engineers: they worked night and day, and came up with the design principles for Project Mercury.</p> <p> Their proposals included the design of the capsule in which Shepard flew and the choice of rockets, while their decisions on astronaut qualifications, training and mission control procedures lasted through to the moon landings. Work began on Project Mercury in 1959, when Gilruth recruited 34 other engineers and flight directors to the space task group, which was based at Langley, Virginia - better known today as \"spooks corner\", the headquarters of the CIA.</p> <p> The group soon outgrew its quarters there, and the operation was moved to Clear Lake, near Houston, where an extensive campus-style space centre was built, which remains the home of US astronauts. Gilruth remained at Houston until 1972.</p> <p> As the Apollo project was winding down, he retired to devote himself full-time to building the boat of his dreams, one in which he could circumnavigate the world. He completed a 52ft multi-hull boat, sailed it to his retirement home in Virginia, but never felt his nautical skills matched his astronautical ones, so never sailed around the world. He is survived by his wife, Georgene Evans Gilruth, a daughter and a stepson. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Robert Rowe Gilruth, aerospace engineer and administrator, born October 8 1913; died August 17 2000 </p>",
  "When I knew her, my Aunt Beryl lived in rural Suffolk. This was, however, not always the case. She had been rather racy in her youth and when she was 21 she did something it had never occurred to anyone in our clan to do: she moved to Birmingham. Not only did she move to Birmingham but she took up with an Indian waiter newly arrived from Bombay. Despite a complete inability to communicate, love blossomed. Aunt B blossomed, too - which was something, for she was no beauty. She had quite sharp features and ears large enough to give the impression of two small moons setting directly behind her. <p>Then tragedy struck. One wet Tuesday evening the waiter met an untimely death. I can't really say too much about it because the case at the industrial tribunal was never really settled. Suffice it to say his demise was not entirely painless, involving as it did a newly cleaned linoleum floor, a surprisingly small knob of butter and an automatic chapatti-making machine. Aunt Beryl was devastated and my family united in grief for her. Never again was any one of my kin heard to order chicken tikka masala with anything approaching gusto. </p> <p>Ladened with woe, Aunt Beryl got in her car and drove away. Mile after misery mile she steered until at last she came to the small town of Wigs-on-Merriemen in the heart of the county of Suffolk. Here she settled, partly because it was beautiful and partly because it was here that the big end of her Vauxhall Viva finally gave out. Her man had died, her car had died and I think something in my aunt's spirit faded to black. </p> <p>Wigs-on-Merriemen was not so much a sleepy town as mildly catatonic. Despite this the burghers tended their houses carefully and were not shy of colourful facades. Perched on a hill, pink houses lined the high street like firm slices of fresh blancmange. Aunt Beryl's house stood at the foot of the town in a small field by itself. It was painted not pink but brilliant blue. When the sun rose behind the field, the house looked like the realisation of Chicken Lickin's worst fears. A chunk of sky come to rest on earth. </p> <p>Aunt Beryl thought the house was perfect. Unfortunately so, too, did the fieldmice. For nearly 40 years they invaded her home. Aunt B had no fight left in her. Often she would let the mice have their way and flee to her garden. There she applied herself to raising dahlias and the creation of devotional tapestry kneelers for the church on the hill. The entire town knelt in comfort thanks to sad old Aunt Beryl. </p> <p>All this went on until her 60th birthday. Then one fine June morning, Aunt B woke up, turned 60 and, for no discernible reason, her heart began to open again. My aunt knew that she would always love her waiter but at last, she was ready once more for romance. </p> <p>On that day, on the hill above my aunt's mouse-infested house of sorrow, the town was preparing for a great event. The Macclesfield Medieval Marchers were marching in. The troupe consisted of 12 men who took one month each year to tour the country and recreate medieval jousting tournaments. Among these summer knights were a chiropodist, a pig farmer, the wet fish manager from Macclesfield's Tesco and Rodney. As chance would have it, ordinarily Rodney was in pest control. Had been for 30 years. He liked his work. He understood rodents and pests, their likes and dislikes, their attitudes to life. But Rodney had a secret longing for adventure. So he gave up his traps and pellets and powders for one summer to march with the men. </p> <p>Except Rodney didn't march. He was too new to march. Rodney drove the Ford Transit van. At each fresh engagement, Rodney would park the van on the outskirts and the men would kit themselves up for the entrance march. It was no amateur affair. Much effort had been made in the provision of entirely authentic- looking costumes. Richard the Lionheart led the way in crimson and gold, followed by brocaded Lords of the Court, two pages and, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, at each date in the tour, the marchers arranged for the loan of four sturdy horses. These hired steeds were bedecked in sumptuous cloth and carried the pride of four fully armoured knights. </p> <p>The silver suits, although copies, were correct in every detail. Visors, gauntlets, breastplates and chainmail clanked and groaned as the horses bore their charges to battle. The sun sparkled on the highly polished armour and there was not a person in Wigs-on-Merriemen who could resist giving a little cheer at such a sight. Rodney slowly brought up the rear in the van. Not for him the adulation of the crowd. </p> <p>The day went well. Battles were fought, swords brandished and local damsels rescued. By nightfall, everyone had retired to the Runt and Cockrell for a well-deserved pint. By closing, Rodney was mildly inebriated. He stepped out into the high street and realised with horror that he had forgotten to return the horses. They were still tied to a rail on the pitch. </p> <p>The fresh air hit him hard and by the time he got to his charges, he was quite drunk indeed. The moon shone upon the steeds and Rodney knew, with the clarity given only by alcohol, that this was his moment. How he got dressed in armour by himself and up on a horse no one will ever know. Patently the effort exhausted him. Instead of a triumphant moonlit perambulation, Sir Rodney fell asleep astride his mount. </p> <p>He awoke near dawn to find that the visor on his helmet had fallen shut as he slept. Still heavy with the night's activities, he leant forward and tried to unclasp the metal device. The horse mistook this move as an invitation to walk forward. The armour was heavy and Rodney had never been on a horse before. His body swayed violently and the trainee knight dug his heels in to try to gain some balance. The horse mistook this move as an invitation to begin to trot. Before he knew it, Rodney and the horse were coming round the corner at the top of the high street at a remarkably quick pace. </p> <p>The high street ran in a straight line from the top of the hill all the way down to Aunt B's house. The sun was just starting to rise and perhaps the horse saw, for the first time, the lure of the open road. Perhaps some distant echo of his forefathers' Light Brigade heroics stirred in his fetlocks for he began to gallop. Clinging on for dear life, Rodney hurtled past the pink houses, past the Runt and Cockrell and on down the cobbled hill. Through the narrow slit of his closed visor, Rodney could see little. He could feel the descent of the horse but there appeared to be nothing but blue sky ahead. At last the horse, overwhelmed by burden and speed, tripped and Rodney flew through the air. </p> <p>The summer knight flew to the heavens and into Aunt B's garden. He came to rest in a bed of dahlias where Aunt Beryl, driven from her house by the mice, sat dreaming of romance. With great presence of mind, she leant over to open Rodney's visor. They stared at each other. She saw in him her knight in shining armour. Perhaps, with her pointy nose and large ears, he saw in her an echo of the rodents who until now had been his life. </p> <p>By autumn they were married. Rodney rid the house of fieldmice and when he got down on one knee to ask for her hand, Aunt Beryl made sure her knight knelt in great comfort. </p> <p>This series continues next Monday.

  "Renegade former M15 officer David Shayler was arrested at Dover port immediately after his arrival in Britain at 11 o'clock this morning. <p>Uniformed officers were waiting at the building as Mr Shayler arrived on a bus accompanied by his family and dozens of photographers and journalists.</p> <p>Mr Shayler fled to France in 1997 after claiming two MI6 officers, who he believes should be tried for conspiracy to murder, were behind a failed attempt to assassinate Libyan leader Muammar Gadafy.</p> <p>It is thought he will face two charges under the Official Secrets Act for leaking information to the press, which may result in a four-year prison sentence.</p> <p>Mr Shayler's lawyer, John Wadham, claims to have received a guarantee from the Crown Prosecution Service that his client will be granted bail following a magistrates' hearing.</p> <p>This morning Mr Shayler, 34, again insisted he had leaked the information for the public good and had not compromised national security. </p> <p>Standing at the quayside with his brother and his partner of seven years, Annie Machon, he said: \"The important thing is that I did not damage national security. We were very responsible.\"</p> <p>\"A lot of MPs in Britain don't seem to give a damn about civil liberties\u0085 It really is an absolute scandal that the information which was passed to Jack Straw in 1999 is only being looked at now.\"</p> <p>In an indication that it may be treating Mr Shayler's claims seriously, it was revealed yesterday that Scotland Yard will also be interviewing Mr Shayler not as a suspect but as a witness, according to Mr Wadham. </p> <p>The confirmation that Special Branch was examining the allegations is fuelling growing speculation that Mr Shayler may never stand trial. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and the home secretary, Jack Straw, could even be called as witnesses in such a case. \"I think in many ways the government does not want to see me in open court because that in many ways raises more problems for them than it raises for me,\" Mr Shayler said.</p> <p>Mr Shayler's return is also thought to have been encouraged by the introduction of European human rights legislation, to be incorporated into British law in October, which will provide a public interest defence for secret service \"whistle-blowers\". </p> <p>\"It certainly gives me a defence,\" he said. \"If I was tried tomorrow without that act the judge would say that here is this man talking about secrets on television, you have to convict him.\" </p> <p>When he became a fugitive three years ago, Shayler said he was prepared to go to jail in order to reveal what he claimed were the illegal and incompetent actions of the British security services. </p> <p>However today he admitted that three months in a Parisian jail, where he was held during a failed extradition attempt by the British government, had left him feeling some trepidation as he prepared to return home. </p> <p>The forthcoming trial of former senior army officer Nigel Wylde could prove a test case for the new legislation. </p> <p>Wylde, awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for defusing a bomb in Ulster, will use a similar defence over charges at the Old Bailey in November that he passed military surveillance secrets to author Tony Geraghty. </p> <p>Success for either of them could seriously undermine the Official Secrets Act, which bars tens of thousands of Whitehall officials and military personnel from revealing sensitive information.</p>",
  "<p>The uneasy relationship between the media and Downing Street is likely to become more strained when Tony and Cherie Blair return from holiday at the end of this month. </p> <p>Just as the row started to calm down over the alleged hotel \"high jinks \" of their son Euan, 16, on Friday, Downing Street was facing the problem yesterday of whether to try to stop snatched pictures of the Blair family from being published in the media today. </p> <p>Dozens of photographers descended on the church in Saint-Martin d'Oydes, in south-west France, yesterday where the Blairs were celebrating mass. </p> <p>Publication in any British newspaper would be a breach of the informal agreement between the Blairs and the press for one \"photo opportunity\" on their two-week break. But the pictures will certainly be used today in the French press, which is not party to any agreement. </p> <p>Hints were already being given last night by Number 10 that the Blair family, who had been overwhelmed by the number of mainly French photographers who turned up yesterday, accept that there is little they can do to prevent their publication in Britain. But such an attitude will make a mockery of any restraint shown by the media up to now. </p> <p>The handling of the Blairs' right to privacy by Downing Street has been subject to a series of u-turns since the story about Euan broke. Initially when faced with newspapers quoting an Italian newspaper and a news agency's lurid report about Euan's behaviour in the hotel, on the island of Ponza, Downing Street declined to comment. This is often seen by newspapers as a green light to publish. </p> <p>Only after Downing Street got the British embassy in Rome to check with the hotel's manager about the incident did Number 10 issue a denial. But questioned about it in detail, they admitted that the hotel manager did receive a complaint from a guest who could not sleep and asked Euan and friends to lower their voices at 5am. </p> <p>Downing Street was yesterday sticking to the line that the Blairs intended to study \"the totality of the cuttings\" on Euan before deciding whether to bring a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission for inaccuracy or intrusion. </p> <p>The Blairs cannot bring a complaint in Britain against the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero which broke the story claiming that Euan and two friends had disturbed the peace of holidymakers by charging up and down the hotel corridors and going up and down in the lifts. </p> <p>But the Blairs are entitled to take the paper to the Italian equivalent of the Press Complaints Commission and put in a complaint against the journalist who wrote the article. In Italy, where journalists have to obtain a licence to practice, such a complaint could be more damaging than in Britain. Downing Street yesterday said that Mr Blair had not thought about that. </p> <p>Matters could become more inflamed when Euan's GCSE results become public on Thursday. No statement on them is planned from Downing Street, but there is certain to be a media scramble to get them: they are sent to the Oratory school in London 24 hours before they are publicly released. The media are certain to make Euan a star turn on Thursday just as Prince William's A-level results made the headlines.</p>",
  "Almost every vehicle in Weipa is a four-wheel drive. Eagles circle above the local supermarket and many of its prefabricated houses are lightly dusted with paprika-red soil from a nearby bauxite mine. <p>The towns 2,500 residents live about as far off the beaten track as you can get, a 10-hour drive along dirt roads - washed out between November and April by monsoons - from the nearest city, Cairns. </p> <p>This small part of northern Australia's Cape York peninsula is not the easiest spot on which to assemble stage, sound and lighting facilities that wouldn't be out of place at Glastonbury and bring together 26 schools, 800 children and an audience larger than the town. </p> <p>But last week they all rolled up, in 4WD buses and chartered light aircraft, to join the Croc Eisteddfod festival, part of a growing drive to halt the destructive spiral of truancy, ill-health and addiction in many Aboriginal communities.</p> <p> For the third year running, the schools spent months planning 10-minute performances, where they danced to medlies of traditional didgeridoo-inspired music and the - more popular - pre-teen tunes of global favourites S Club 7, 5ive! and the Backstreet Boys. </p> <p> A local school from the Aboriginal village of Mapoon - a mere one-hour away - opened the Croc festival. Reluctantly interviewed by the compere, one pupil, Alan, said the festival's message was \"fun\".</p> <p> He was halfway there, for as subsequent participants and the organisers constantly stressed, it was about showing you could have a good time while remaining \"100% in control\", without recourse to three of the most destructive forces in isolated Aboriginal societies: alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. </p> <p> In Cape York's indigenous communities, 67% of adults smoke tobacco, compared to 25% of adult Australians. More than half Cape York's Aborigines drink at harmful levels, while 89% of the person-to-person injuries (the biggest cause of injuries) recorded in the area involve alcohol. </p> <p> These addictions help depress the life-expectancy of Aboriginal children to 27 years less than their white classmates. The Aborigine median age of death is 50; for the overall population of Australia it is 77. </p> <p> As Australia's movement to \"reconcile\" black and white Australia has shown, many are blamed for such inequality. Before European settlers spread into Cape York just over 100 years ago, its population was estimated at 20,000-50,000. It is now 6,000. </p> <p> Governments, religious missions and mining companies all helped herd Aborigines into camps, forcing the abandonment of their (healthy) hunting and gathering lifestyle. </p> <p> In 1967, Aborigines belatedly gained full Australian citizenship; they also \"won\" the right to drink. Collusion between breweries and state governments in the 1970s promoted the sale of alcohol in communities as one of the best money-making schemes for Aboriginal stores. </p> <p>Stuck in remote villages without jobs, a cycle of truancy, ill-health and addiction set in for many, cementing their dependence on state benefits. \"Welfare has been disastrous rather than helpful,\" says Kerry Arabena, former executive director of Cape York health council.</p> <p> It is a view increasingly echoed by influential Aboriginal leaders and by the communities themselves. </p> <p> \"Most of us, unfortunately, are dependent on benefits,\" says Peter Guivarra, chair of Mapoon's local council. He wants to be given resources to develop self-sufficiency through local trades, such as plumbing and carpentry, as well as expressing the more distant hope that eco-tourism could bring money and jobs into the area.</p> <p> \"We're living right on the water here. There is heaps of potential. The only way forward is economic development,\" he says. </p> <p> Such talk of economic development to end dependency pleases Australia's conservative government, which last week pledged to pass new welfare laws after the publication of a report calling for a benefits revolution along Blairite lines of \"mutual obligation\" - in short, that benefits should be worked for.</p> <p> But Aborigines already work for their benefits through community development economic programmes, which have been criticised by many Aboriginal leaders. Increasingly, \"partnership\" events, such as the Croc festival, are the great hope for providing Aboriginal communities with choices and opportunities. </p> <p> The Croc festival brings together the Queensland state government, local governments and the myriad support groups that make up what is disparagingly labelled the \"Aboriginal industry\".</p> <p> But working together in such informal and practical ways, say the groups, is a better tool of reconciliation than grand gestures, formal laws or government handouts. </p> <p> Such partnerships also stress the importance of real practical outcomes. The festival is already producing these.</p> <p> Shane Williams, director of Aboriginal student services in Queensland, says: \"Talking to schools we have seen level of attendance increase not just during the festival but throughout the year.\" </p> <p> Planning the performances helped stop truancy beforehand; afterwards the pupils basked in a proud glow from their 10 minutes strutting across the stage. </p> <p> \"What makes Mapoon good?\" the compere asked another local pupil, Brett. \"Not too many crocs,\" he replied. He couldn't get enough of the festival, but was less enthusiastic about the dangerous reptiles that lurk in Cape York's creeks. </p>",
  "<p>Politics and economics; national sovereignty, the control of monetary policy or the impact of currency instability; these are the staples of the debate over the single currency. But global warming, mad cow disease and swine fever?

The issue is balanced on a knife edge. The latest opinion poll, out yesterday, puts the \"yes\" camp one point ahead of the \"no\" side - 44% to 43% - with the rest undecided. </p> <p>The \"no\" camp is coming up with some imaginative arguments in an attempt to tip the balance of opinion its way. The central theme is that, though the Danish krone is pegged to the euro in a narrow band, it still needs to retain the option to devalue. Why? Well, here is Keld Albrechtsen, the Unity List party's spokesman on European Union affairs. Global warming could spell trouble for low lying Denmark, he argues. </p> <p>\"Water levels in the oceans could rise so much that Denmark will no longer be an ideal place to live. If Copenhagen airport disappears under the sea, Denmark will face great economic problems.\" </p> <p>If you think devaluation at that stage might fall into the \"too little, too late\", not to say frankly irrelevant, category, Ole Krarup of the People's Movement against the EU has an alternative approach. Around 15% of Danish exports are agricultural produce and, according to Mr Krarup, an outbreak of mad cow disease or swine fever could do so much damage that devaluation would be the only solution to avoid a severe economic shock. </p> <p>If pigs and cows are not enough, rebel MP Frank Dahlgaard has an addition to the menagerie. Being tied to the euro, he says, is like being handcuffed to a gorilla. \"The gorilla sets the pace but we still have the key to unlock the handcuffs.\" So that's a \"no\" then.</p>",
  "Ferteze Nimari had lost two of her brothers and her husband was forced to bury all the dead in one grave. Later, packed into a stifling bus with sixty fellow Kosovars, the couple held onto each other as he clutched a strap suspended from the ceiling. The bus stopped in the Stankovac I refugee camp in Macedonia and they told their story. 'The tank came to our village of Sllovi. The Serb neighbours said not to worry - it was just there to observe us. But by lunchtime the next day a teenage girl lay dead in the street. Then another 15 people were killed. They told us to run into the woods and they started shooting us.' <p>I asked them so many questions about what they had seen. 'What happened when your brothers were shot?' 'How many people did you bury?' 'How do you feel now?' When they said the Serbs had forced an old woman into a tent and burned her alive I looked at them doubtfully and asked how they knew she had been alive. Someone from her family had seen it happen, they said. </p> <p>The Nimaris had arrived at what they thought was a safe haven, but I pursued them, and I did so unsparingly. I got on the bus when the driver opened the doors for air. They had stood for hours on that malodorous bus. I felt sorry for them: but not so sorry that I stopped the questions. They had yet to step down to the misery of the camp the British press has taken to calling 'Brazda'. All they had was a bottle of water passed to them through an open window - and my questions. Ferteze, eight months pregnant, caught me glancing at the watch on her wrist when Remzi, her husband, said all the women in the village had been robbed of their jewellery. </p> <p>Earlier that day, Ron Redmond, the baseball-capped spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, stood at the Blace border crossing from Kosovo into Macedonia and said there were new reports of mass rapes and killings from three villages in the Lipljan area: Sllovi, Hallac Evogel and Ribari Evogel. He spoke to the press of bodies being desecrated, eyes being shot out. The way he talked it sounded as if there had been at least a hundred murders and dozens of rapes. When I pressed him on the rapes, asking him to be more precise, he reduced it a bit and said he had heard that five or six teenage girls had been raped and murdered. He had not spoken to any witnesses. 'We have no way of verifying these reports of rape,' he conceded. 'These are among the first that we have heard of at this border.' </p> <p>Other UNHCR officials later told stories of women being tied to the walls of their houses and burned, 24 bodies buried in Kosovo Polje. Another report, again from Sllovi, put the dead at a hundred. Mr and Mrs Nimari were adamant that it was 16. Truth can be scarce at the Blace border and in the camps dotted around Macedonia, but you are not allowed to say that during a war like this, where it may be that bad things are being done on both sides, just as you are not allowed to doubt atrocity.</p> <p>It's as if Nato and its entourage were trying to make up for the witlessness of the past: trying to show that whatever we do, we won't be turning a blind eye. But the simple-minded reporter in me wants to ask a question: is there any real evidence for what is being said? In Macedonia, listening to the stories and the UNHCR accounts, you would find it hard to tell what was hearsay and what was fact. When you looked at the people clinging onto the carrier bags that now held the remnants of their lives, it seemed evident that terrible things had happened to them, that people had been forced to flee their homes and drag themselves to a non-life in another country. Each person arriving at the camps had experienced some kind of trauma, and most are still living it. Many have seen death and other horrors. It is just that there is little to suggest that they have seen it in the ways, and on the scale, that people want to say they have. Most of those who have seen killing have seen one or two shot and the bodies of others. </p> <p>Eye-witnesses to multiple atrocities are very rare and the simple - and not at all simple - truth is that it can often be hard to establish the veracity of the information. One afternoon, the people in charge said there were refugees arriving who talked of sixty or more being killed in one village, fifty in another, but I could not find one eye-witness who actually saw these things happening. Now, they may have happened. But what we have is a situation where Western journalists accept details without question. Almost every day, the world's media, jostling for stories in Macedonia, strain to find figures that may well not exist. In the absence of any testimony, many just report what some agency or other has told them. I stood by as a reporter from BBC World reeled off what Ron Redmond had said, using the words 'hundreds', 'rape' and 'murder' in the same breath. By way of qualification (a fairly meaningless one in the circumstances), he added that the stories had yet to be substantiated. Why, then, had he reported them so keenly in the first place? </p> <p>I found myself wanting to discover the evidence. I was also impatient to find a 'good' story - i.e. a mass atrocity. As each new bus trundled over the border, I told my interpreter to shout through the windows asking if anyone was from the three villages Redmond had mentioned. Did they know anyone, had they seen anything? We went along twenty buses before we found Mr and Mrs Nimari. A transit camp had been set up in the no man's land between the river and the frontier road at Blace. This was where the tens of thousands were trapped in fetid misery before Macedonian officials dispersed them one night to the newly-built camps. Now the place is used to give a night's rest to some of the great many who wait patiently at this border for entry to a country that doesn't want them and to which they really don't want to go. </p> <p>Every 20 minutes, the Macedonian police let around two hundred people clamber down a dirt path to be processed before being admitted into the camp. As they stood in line, I asked whether anyone was from those villages and whether they'd seen anything they wanted to talk about. No one was and no one did. Or at least they didn't want to tell us about it. It seemed that the Nimaris were the only people from Sllovi. I was moved by their fear and passion to believe everything they said. Remzi told me he'd buried the dead in a grave in the woods at Lugi i Demes. </p> <p>It will take the verifiers from the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to put our agitated, agitating minds at rest. The officers from ICTY, the verifiers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and researchers from Human Rights Watch are compiling reports of war crimes, which will be used at a later date for any trial at The Hague. Speaking to these people, I found them to be wary of using the hyperbole favoured by reporters and by the UNHCR. They say they have yet to see evidence of atrocities on the scale that they witnessed while working in Bosnia. </p> <p>When I went to see Benedicte Giaever, the co-ordinator for OSCE's field office in Skopje, I saw that she was angered by the behaviour of the media. I squirmed when she said she had heard of a female journalist getting onto a bus to question some refugees. She said almost every journalist who came to see her asked one thing: could she give them a rape victim to interview. She spoke of one woman being 'hunted down' by journalists and having to have her tent moved to shelter her from their intrusions: she had had a breakdown. I wanted at the same time to test the validity of the truths being offered us and to behave decently in the face of what could not be known for sure, and I knew it wasn't possible to do both. Yet I could see that much of this rough treatment of female refugees was a direct consequence of Robin Cook telling the world that there was evidence of rape camps inside Kosovo. 'Young women are being separated from the refugee columns,' he said, 'and forced to undergo systematic rape in an army camp. We have evidence from many refugees who have managed to escape that others were taken to rape camps.' </p> <p>I know of several tabloid reporters who were despatched to Macedonia and Albania with the sole purpose of finding a rape victim. Talking to each other in the bar of Skopje's Hotel Continental we rehearsed the question which has now become notorious: 'Is there anyone here who's been raped and speaks English?' We were aware of the implications of some of our more despicable behaviour. We knew that one woman, raped by Serbian soldiers then forced to leave her country, was traumatised all over again by a journalist looking for a good story. The things you come to know as a journalist do not march in single file. Facts are often renegade. </p> <p>But among the rape victims arriving in Macedonia nobody spoke of anything like the camps the British Foreign Secretary referred to. Benedicte Giaever told me there had been rape, but not systematic and not on a grand scale. The same was true of the killing. 'We don't have big numbers,' she said. 'What we have are consistent small numbers - two here, five there, ten here, seven there.' Unlike the media and the UNHCR, the OSCE works in a slow, methodical way, waiting a few days till the refugees have settled in before they begin to ask questions. 'These people have just arrived and I would say they are still under a lot of stress and tension,' Giaever says. 'In that situation, 5 people can easily turn into 75. It's not that they want to lie but often they are confused. It's not to say it didn't happen. But a story could have moved around from village to village and everyone from that village tells it as if it happened to them.' </p> <p>Another senior OSCE source spoke even more clearly than any of us were inclined to do. He told me he suspected that the Kosovo Liberation Army had been persuading people to talk in bigger numbers, to crank up the horror so that Nato might be persuaded to send ground troops in faster. Robin Cook's rape camp was the same thing, he said: an attempt to get the British public behind the bombing. And wasn't all this a lesson in how propaganda works in modern war? When I came back to London, I went to see the KLA's spokesman and recruiting officer in Golders Green. Dr Pleurat Sejdiu, sitting beside the KLA flag and busts of the Albanian national hero Skenderbeg, said there were indeed rape camps, and that the evidence of mass atrocities was to be found among the refugees in Albania, not in Macedonia. He is in daily contact with the KLA frontline command by satellite phone and has been told of rape camps in Gjakova, Rahovec, Suhareka, Prizren and Skenderaj. 'We know there are concentration camps and women are kept and raped there,' he said. 'I don't think we will get the evidence until we go in with the ground troops. There are a lot of stories confirming it. There are mass executions and mass graves are appearing now. We have reports from our special units moving around Kosovo. And the pertinent question is: where are the young men who have been taken from the refugee columns? I think everything will be proved when Nato troops go in.' </p> <p>In Skopje I had been to see Ben Ward, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, in the flat he is renting (he had found the Hotel Continental too expensive and the behaviour of the reporters too disconcerting): he pored over maps of Kosovo and pointed to villages where he knows incidents have taken place. His information comes from eye-witnesses and is corroborated by the testimony of others. He has noted a very definite scorched-earth policy. But while his latest report details killings and the mutilation of corpses in the villages of Bajnica and Cakaj, he doesn't think there is evidence of mass executions. 'It is very rare for people not to know someone who knows about people being killed. But there doesn't appear to be anything to support allegations of mass killings,' he said. 'It is generally paramilitaries who are responsible. It doesn't seem organised. There appear to be individual acts of sadism rather than anything else. There seems not to be any policy or instruction, but that isn't to say that people have not been given the latitude to kill. However, I don't think at this stage we have anything that adds up to the systematic killing of civilians.' </p> <p>Ward believes that those who stayed longer in Kosovo have been subjected to more violence, that many have been terrorised because they have stayed so long. Many have fled terror but some of those Ward spoke to said they were fleeing the Nato bombs. 'The Serbs didn't touch us until Nato attacked,' a Kosovar told him. One morning I made a two-year-old girl hysterical. I had asked her parents to show me the wound the child suffered when the bullet that killed her grandmother entered her shoulder. I was getting desperate for some kind of truth to hold onto. They pulled up Marigona Azemi's dress and her pink T-shirt and pointed to a worn bandage. She squealed and said it was the 'licia' who shot her, unable to get her small tongue round the Albanian word milicia. Like the majority of those killed or wounded or abused by the Serbs, Marigona was attacked by paramilitaries, a vicious, marauding band. Seven people in her village of Lovc - including her grandmother Nexhmije - were killed. Some villagers claimed that a local teacher and his cousin were skinned alive before they were burned, others said they were burned alive. No one actually saw this but the rest of what they had to say tallied when they told their stories independently.</p> <p> The Azemi family had been trying to escape on its tractor when the paramilitaries opened fire: what they did was sadistic and it was a horrendous tale, but it couldn't be turned into a story of mass atrocity. Some people tell me that evil is evil; that there's no point in quantifying it. Does that mean I am to accept Robin Cook's unchecked facts because they align with my hunches? I feel bad for having made Marigona cry in order to prove to myself that there was truth in her story. (For days, I went to her - pathetically - with dolls and hair bobbles and sweets and orange juice.) But that is not all I feel. Watching the television images and listening to the newscasters thunder about further reports of Serb massacres and of genocide, I feel uneasy about saying that they have very little to go on. Yet almost every newspaper journalist I spoke to privately in Macedonia felt the same way. The story being seen at home is different from the one that appeared to be happening on the ground. </p> <p>Maybe the truth here is not one thing: but I don't want to be an accomplice to a lie. I don't want to bellow for my life or for theirs, yet there's something not right in this easy way with detail. It is a surreal place, Macedonia, and it was this aspect to which a friend drew my attention when I got home. Nobody much wants to return to Jean Cocteau, but there was something soothing in the words my friend quoted. 'History is a combination of reality and lies,' he said. 'The reality of history becomes a lie. The reality of the fable becomes the truth.'</p> <p>\u0095 Audrey Gillan is a reporter on the Guardian, for whom she went to Macedonia.
