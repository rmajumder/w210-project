  "<p>Having discovered that bank-robber Henry (Paul Newman) faked the stroke which led to his transfer from jail, small-town nurse Carol (Linda Fiorentino) and her husband Wayne (Dermot Mulroney) have taken him to a remote bar. </p> <p>\"It's funny,\" Henry explains, \"the kind of stuff you can get shipped into a prison library.

  "<p>Last December saw a flurry of tobacco advertising in cinemas nationwide, on poster sites across the UK and throughout the national press. Tobacco advertisers ploughed vast budgets into what they thought would be their last ad campaigns to run in the UK. Many also paid for final \"goodbye\" campaigns to sign the brands off once and for all. </p> <p>That was before the European Court of Justice overruled the European Union's plan to ban tobacco advertising - a big embarrassment to the UK government, which had promised the ban in its manifesto. </p> <p>The government has come in for considerable criticism from the UK's ad industry for its handling of the affair. </p> <p>\"Everyone tried telling the government that this would happen but it got on its high horse and wouldn't listen,\" says Rupert Howell, president of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. </p> <p>\"The outcome was completely inevitable and the government should have been prepared to reach some compromise. The only option it left the tobacco industry was to take it to court.\" </p> <p>It was a small victory for the tobacco advertisers, buying them more time, but within hours Yvette Cooper, the public health minister, declared her determination to introduce a bill in the Queen's Speech curbing cigarette promotion. And when it does eventually come into force, the UK ban is likely to be much tougher. </p> <p>The government has suffered a serious loss of face ever since the four big UK tobacco companies (Gallaher, Imperial, BAT and Rothmans) challenged the EU directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship in 1998. </p> <p>In June this year a Commons committee revealed that ad agencies had consistently tried to get round government attempts to ban tobacco advertising. </p> <p>Its report claimed the ad industry had used its \"creative talents to undermine government policy and evade regulation\". </p> <p>Evidence was submitted by four ad agencies - Mustoe Merriman Herring Levy, which handles Imperial; M&amp;C Saatchi, which has Silk Cut; CDP, which works with Gallaher; and TBWA, which has Marlboro. </p> <p>The findings were that voluntary agreements - which stipulate that tobacco companies must not, for example, advertise in magazines that have a young readership, nor within 200 metres of schools, nor in shop windows, and that all ads must be sanctioned by the ASA prior to release - had served the public badly. </p> <p>The committee's report concluded that regulations were seen by ad agencies as hurdles to be side-stepped and legislation banning advertising as a challenge - a policy to be undermined by whatever means possible. </p> <p>With this in mind, Nick Mustoe, the chief executive at Mustoe Merriman Herring Levy, says that the government's aggressive stance means that \"we could see a blanket ban on advertising as soon as next spring, assuming that they can push through primary legislation smoothly. This is now likely to be more far-reaching. It could completely ban all print and poster advertising, and put a block on all point-of-sale material as well as all database marketing, loyalty schemes and brand extension work.\" </p> <p>John Carlisle, the director of public affairs at the cigarette companies' trade body, the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, is now unlikely, it seems, to get his wish to retain the voluntary code of practice. But he says the industry will fight for its right to retain direct communication with its customers. </p> <p>He also points out that the Human Rights Act, which came into operation this month, may make it difficult for the government to ban the flow of literature between tobacco companies and smokers who ask for it. </p> <p>After so many false starts for the ban, there is currently little agreement between tobacco companies on how to react to Cooper's determination to impose a UK ban. </p> <p>As the December deadline loomed last year, M&amp;C Saatchi designed and created hundreds of large inflatable women, wearing split silk dresses and holding signs that read \"it's not over till the fat lady sings\". Those dolls have been in storage ever since, but they could finally get to see the light of day as early as next March.</p>",
  "<p>It could be the most shocking tabloid story in America - and one that they can't print. Splashed across newspaper delivery lorries making their rounds in the northeastern states of America are the words, \"No Elvis. No Aliens. No UFOs.\" It's not, of course, that aliens have stopped abducting, or that Elvis no longer eats at Burger King, it's just that the new management at American Media, publisher of the National Enquirer, the Globe and the Star, has decreed that readers will no longer be hearing of it. </p> <p>America's tabloids are undergoing a reinvention under the leadership of David Pecker, a 48-year-old alumnus of the French company that publishes glossy magazines such as Elle and George. He believes that the way to halt the precipitous drop in readership that all the supermarket tabloids have suffered over the past decade is to take them upmarket. </p> <p>It was the Star that first alleged Bill Clinton's affair with Gennifer Flowers and it was the Enquirer that revealed OJ Simpson's ownership of a pair of Bruno Magli shoes - the very same that his wife's murderer apparently wore. Moreover, much of the running in the tales of Monica Lewinsky, John Kennedy Jr and murdered child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey was made by the tabloids. But despite these successes, readership is falling. The National Enquirer's circulation has dropped from 3.1m in 1994 to 2.1m last year. Over the same period, the Star's figures slid from 2.8m to 1.8m and the Globe's from 1m to just over 800,000. </p> <p>Under Pecker, American Media is attempting to re-brand, re-position or tweak its seven major titles to cover the spectrum from country music (Country Weekly) to the sensational to the super-weird: the National Examiner will focus on strange human interest stories; the Star on celebrity; the National Enquirer on credible, news-driven tales; the Globe will still dish the dirt on celebs; the Sun will focus on a more mature readership, with health-orientated and religious articles, and Weekly World News on nonsense such as the wedding of the world's fattest man. </p> <p>Although Pecker has no news background and his experience is in accountancy and marketing, he has a clear idea of the role tabloids need to play to win back readership. \"What tabloids stand for is to expose the hypocrisy of the rich and famous,\" he says. When he took over the company last year, he commissioned 5,000 consumer interviews to discover why only one out of eight people who flip through an American Media title at the supermarket checkout buys it. The answer? \"They were fascinated. But they didn't believe it.\" </p> <p>On his arrival, Pecker issued an edict: no more autopsy shots, no more Elvis sightings, no more UFOs. The tabloids would be entering an era of respectability, in which big-name advertisers would buy space, readers would return and journalists would want jobs. \"The easiest way to look at it is, if a big Hollywood story breaks, the Enquirer would do investigative stories, the Star would cover the impact on the celebrity's career, and the Globe would really do the spicy parts of the story,\" Pecker says. </p> <p>After banning adverts for psychic healers and miracle remedies, the titles have begun to attract new advertisers. The Enquirer has been redesigned with a sleeker, all-colour look, bolstered by an extra $3m for the editorial budget and backed with a $50m advertising campaign. In line with a new Enquirer slogan, \"Get it first. Get it fast. Get it Right\", old-style headlines such as \"Kills Pal And Eats Pieces Of Flesh\" have been toned down. And although Pecker defends his titles' chequebook jour nalism he has put a stop to traditional tabloid set-ups. </p> <p>But many doubt that US tabloids can really change. \"I can't imagine a transformation that would give them credibility,\" says Bob Steele, a specialist in journalistic ethics at the Poynter Institute in St Petersburg, Florida. \"Good for them if they want to respect themselves. The question remains: What do they stand for as a news organisation?\" </p> <p>But 5m Americans who buy Pecker's tabloids know exactly why they do so, even if they don't believe everything they read. Will tamer tabloids succeed? Pecker thinks so: \"I expect our current revenues of $500m will grow to $5 billion in 10 years, and we would be involved in magazines, internet, books, TV, movies and more.\" But no Elvis.</p>",
  "<p>Wembley is history, as is England's all-too-brief period of respite against the Germans and Kevin Keegan's tenure as manager. </p> <p>Collecting their second successive victory in World Cup qualifying Group Nine, and consigning England to an ominous defeat which finally made Keegan's hold on the manager's job untenable, Germany played as if their defeat in Euro 2000 was somewhere between a blip and a bad memory. </p> <p>For England all their bad memories are now flooding back, complete with the familiar elephant trap of a game against little-known and easily underrated Scandinavian opponents in three days. They had gone into this game full of confidence after their draw in France and that epoch-ending victory in Belgium, but a combination of a heavy pitch and a return to normal standards of Teutonic efficiency sucked out all their energy and creativity. </p> <p>It was easy to imagine, after a performance as grey and soggy as the shocking weather, that it might be another 34 years before England can beat this lot. </p> <p>Especially as England spent 77 minutes chasing the game. Germany would have been well content with a draw from this fixture, but as England allowed them to take the lead from a shambolic set- piece as early as the 13th minute, the pattern of the afternoon was set. Germany have only ever lost one World Cup qualifying game, and they did not earn a record like that by refusing gifts or failing to protect a lead. </p> <p>It was obvious from the opening 10 minutes that Germany under Rudi Voller were going to be a different proposition from the spiritless bunch who looked so bereft of inspiration in Charleroi. Within that space of time, the dangerous Mehmet Scholl had already demonstrated skill and steel, as well as intelligently drifting out to the right to make it more difficult for Gareth Southgate to mark him. </p> <p>England attempted a high- tempo opening, with David Beckham coming in from the right to add authority to the midfield, though their movement was predictable. Tellingly, Andy Cole was caught offside twice in the opening exchanges, on the first occasion demanding and receiving a pass from Beckham when the linesman's flag was bound to be raised. </p> <p>Germany are supposed to be the predictable party in this long rivalry, but they effectively laid that jibe to rest moments later, taking the lead with as smart a goal as Wembley has seen in all its 77 years. There appeared no immediate danger when Paul Scholes gave away a free-kick against Michael Ballack 25 yards out, which presumably explains why England thought they had all day to organise a wall. David Seaman was too busy barking out orders to Tony Adams and company to notice Dietmar Hamann shaping to take the kick quickly - though the goalkeeper managed to compose himself right at the last moment - and the Liverpool midfielder's shot was as sharp as his reactions. </p> <p>Seaman has recently been talking about setting himself a target of the World Cup finals in 2002, but being beaten low to his left by a shot from well outside the area hardly bodes well for a 37-year-old, even assuming England get to Japan and Korea. </p> <p>Just to prove Germans have a sense of humour, the travelling supporters spent the rest of the first half accusing the English of only singing when they are winning. The rather witless response from the home fans was 'Stand up if you won the war', which suggests English terrace humour is not what it was. Then again, neither is the football. </p> <p>A ripple of excitement passed through the crowd when Beckham shaped to take a free-kick from a similar range to Hamann's, though the comparison was not flat tering. Beckham took an age, then when the shot finally came it flew straight into Oliver Kahn's midriff. </p> <p>Marco Bode then went close with yet another free- kick after Adams had fouled Scholl, before Cole received a yellow card for a tackle from behind on the same player. </p> <p>Cole did bring a couple of saves from Kahn just after the half-hour but England's best chance of the first half came just before the interval, when Adams found space to meet a Beckham free-kick with a glancing header, but Kahn responded with his best save, diving low to his right to hold the ball. </p> <p>England brought on Kieron Dyer for Gary Neville at half-time, calling time on Southgate's midfield career by switching to a back three, with the substitute operating as right wing-back. It looked like a gamble, but at least Dyer looked the part, injecting pace and enthusiasm into a flagging English attack and almost immediately producing a cross from the right which Jens Nowotny had to scramble clear from Cole. </p> <p>The downside was space behind Dyer for the Germans to attack, an invitation accepted by the irrepressible Scholl after 52 minutes, when he skipped almost unchallenged on the left and into England's penalty area. An extravagant check took him past Martin Keown but Scholl scuffed his shot and Seaman was able to redeem himself with a save low to his left. </p> <p>Far from sitting on their lead Germany were actively looking for another goal, alert enough to realise that England's desperation was forcing them to take risks in defence. England kept going forward doggedly, though Paul Scholes was not enjoying one of his better days and there was depressingly little for Cole or Michael Owen to work with. Beckham pro duced a fingertip save from Kahn on the hour with a fiercely dipping shot from 25 yards, but it was significant that England had been reduced to hopeful efforts from outside the penalty area. </p> <p>Beckham was narrowly wide with another long shot four minutes before making way for Ray Parlour in the 82nd minute. Scholes and Dyer came into the game more in its closing stages, but Germany should have had a second when Nowotny and Bierhoff got in each other's way seven minutes from time. A few boos could be heard at the end. It was a sad way to leave Wembley, but at least it didn't go to penalties. </p> <p> <strong> England:</strong> Seaman, G.Neville (Dyer 46), Adams, Keown, Le Saux (Barry 77), Beckham (Parlour 82), Southgate, Scholes, Barmby, Cole, Owen. <strong> Subs not used</strong> : Martyn, Heskey, Wise, Phillips. </p> <p><strong> Germany:</strong> Kahn, Rehmer, Nowotny, Linke, Deisler, Ramelow, Hamann, Bode (Ziege 86), Ballack, Scholl, Bierhoff. <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Lehmann, Rink, Beinlich, Wosz, Baumann, Neuville. </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : Stefano Braschi (Italy).</p>",
  "Gangland killer Reggie Kray has reached out from beyond the grave to lay to rest one of the most enduring myths surrounding the relationship between the twins. <p>Since the pair were imprisoned in 1969, almost all of their biographers have insisted that Ronnie - certified insane and by far the more violent and unpredictable of the twins - was responsible for leading his brother astray. </p> <p>Crucially, Reggie had been forced to murder Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in a room full of their cronies to show solidarity with Ronnie, who had shot George Cornell at the Blind Beggar pub the year before. </p> <p>Now, Reggie has set the record straight - to pop music. In a singing voice that is more of a growl, Reggie insists Ronnie was blameless and had not unduly influenced any of his actions. He relieves Ronnie of responsibility for anything that happened in his past and insists the blame should lie with himself alone. </p> <p>The song is one of five tracks on a limited-edition CD, Freedom of Thought , out tomorrow, in which the one-time thug condemns racism and declares his undying love for his wife, Roberta. Re-corded shortly before his death from cancer last Sunday at the age of 66, the CD will be available through specialist retailers and over the internet. All profits will be donated to charity. </p> <p>In 'What Did He Do?', a pop song penned by Reggie Kray during his last days in custody, he condemns those who murder simply because of the colour of someone's skin. The lyrics make an emotional plea for the men responsible for the murder of Stephen Lawrence to be brought to justice. </p> <p>He recorded the song after hearing that the Acourt brothers, two of the five men originally charged with Lawrence's murder, had bragged that they were 'the new Krays' and that Ronnie and Reggie were their heroes. </p> <p>Kray wrote the words to one other track - 'Kissable' - and performs the other three. In a strong but aged voice, Kray speaks rather than sings his lines. All the music is provided by Greg Bone, a producer known for his work with the likes of Westlife, Sting and Kylie Minogue. </p> <p>'Reg was never willing to apologise for what he did,' says Rob Ferguson who is behind the CD. 'But he was keen to deter others from a life of crime. This portrays a very different side of him from that most people expect. He always felt very strongly about the Lawrence case. He was many things, but he was never a racist and the fact that the suspects were idolising him made him sick.' </p> <p>Two years ago Kray wrote a letter to Stephen's parents expressing his sympathy for their loss. </p> <p>The original songs on the CD form part of a legacy of more than 500 poems, plays and lyrics which Kray com posed. He also produced dozens of paintings and wrote and replied to thousands of letters. 'He was prolific,' said one friend, 'but at the same time, he did have an awful lot of time on his hands.' </p> <p>But while Kray insists the murder of McVitie was his own idea, he sheds no light about what actually happened the night he was killed. He had been persuaded to attend a party in Evering Road, but was ambushed as soon as he entered the flat. Kray pulled a gun, put it to his head and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. Kray pulled the trigger again and nothing happened. McVitie began to fight back and Kray picked up a knife that was on a nearby plate and stabbed him repeatedly in the face and chest. Many believe that Kray had only intended to frighten McVitie and stabbed him only after being attacked. </p> <p>This week also sees the publication of Kray's memoirs of his 32 years in prison. In A Way of Life he chronicles his stays at some of Britain's most notorious jails, from his days on remand to his attempts to gain parole. </p> <p>His funeral will take place on Wednesday at St Matthew's Church in Bethnal Green. Huge crowds are expected to line the route of the procession, which will pass through the main Kray East End stamping ground. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\">tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The rugged dry hills of northern Pakistan are almost 4,000 miles from the rolling dales of northern England. But if you stand at the corner of some streets in Bradford or Derby or Huddersfield they feel a lot closer. Old men, their beards dyed orange with henna, rest in the evening sunlight on their way to the mosque. Boys, in white round prayer caps and the traditional baggy trousers worn in Karachi or Peshawar, play cricket with a makeshift bat. Women pull their headscarves tight up to their eyes when a stranger walks past. <p>Rukhsana Naz grew up in streets like these. A bright, educated woman, she had been married at 16 to an older man. At 19, she was pregnant by her childhood sweetheart. Her mother told her the child was 'an insult to [her] husband'. </p> <p>When she refused an abortion and demanded a divorce, Rukhsana was invited to a family dinner where her brother, Shazad, strangled her with a skipping rope. Her mother, Shakeela, helped hold her down. Her actions had 'shamed' the family, the court was told. </p> <p>Rukhsana Naz's killers were jailed last year. In June 1995 another Pakistani girl was run down and crushed to death by her brother-in-law for a similar offence in Bradford. Tasleem Begum was 20 and had been married for four years to an older Pakistani man. She too fell in love. She too transgressed traditional codes of behaviour and brought shame on her family. </p> <p>Such killings are not rare in South Asia and the Middle East. There are 5,000 of these 'honour killings' every year across the world, according to a recent UN report 'Living Together, Worlds Apart: Men and Women in a Time of Change'. They occur both in the rural areas, where age-old traditions, value codes and modes of justice still hold sway, and in the cities, where newer tensions have sparked increasing violence towards women. Supporters say the killings maintain social order in changing times; critics allege that chauvinistic men use the 'family honour' as a pretext for punishing women who want more freedom. </p> <p>In the United Kingdom honour killings are also happening. The Observer has found that the deaths of Tasleem Begum and Rukhsana Naz fit into a broader pattern of violence against women within the South Asian community. </p> <p>Since Tasleem Begum died, nearly five years ago, there have been at least 20 other deaths in Britain that can be connected with ideas of 'honour', as well as hundreds of acts of lesser violence. Campaigners claim the honour code - and its accompanying concept of shame - is a key factor in the repression of the rights of tens of thousands of Asian women in Britain. </p> <p>Recent cases involving 'honour' in the UK include: </p> <p>\u0095 A Wakefield man axed to death by family members for continuing an affair with a younger female relative. Beheading is a way of committing an 'honour killing' in rural southern Pakistan. </p> <p>\u0095 A 49-year-old man in Bradford, Jahangir Hussein, jailed last year for murdering his wife and two daughters because he (wrongly) thought they were having affairs. </p> <p>\u0095 Mohammed Merheban, a 25-year-old who killed his friend and brother-in-law whom he suspected of having an affair with his wife. He told Liverpool Crown Court he had committed the murder because his honour had been insulted. A family member told the court that, if he had not acted, 'he would not be allowed to live within that society. That is how people are brought up.' </p> <p>\u0095 A woman in Nottingham who died after being kept in her house for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and a woman in Birmingham who was chained to her kitchen sink for months on end to prevent her leaving the home and behaving immodestly. </p> <p>\u0095 Jaspal Sohal, a west London woman battered to death by her husband with a hammer. He saw killing her as preferable to having her leaving him and 'damaging his izzat' (personal honour). </p> <p>\u0095 A young Sikh woman who married a Hindu man having her home burnt to the ground by her family. </p> <p>\u0095 A prospective son-in-law blinded in one eye by his fianc\u00e9e's Sikh brother - on the orders of his father - because he 'was not good enough'. </p> <p>\u0095 A series of suicides of young women told that they could not marry their lovers because they were from the wrong religious background or caste. </p> <p>There are many other cases involving serious violence where the 'honour' of some of those involved has been important. Legal documents studied by The Observer reveal a host of lesser incidents. They include cases of women being slapped after being seen talking to a man 'without permission' in the street or walking without a veil or even going to work. </p> <p>And there are, as with all domestic violence, tens of thousands of cases that are never reported to the police. </p> <p>Home Office specialists say that, in the UK, women who come to the attention of the police have been assaulted on average 30 times. Philip Balmforth, a police community officer who works with Asian women in Bradford, told The Observer he received about 300 requests for help from victims of abuse, abduction or forced marriages last year, twice the total of 1995. Last year 120 women came to him for help after being subjected to violence within the family. A quarter of those were assaulted by relatives other than their partners. </p> <p>He estimates he hears less than 1 per cent of such incidents. An Essex police report of 1998 refers to 'gross under-reporting' of such attacks throughout Britain and in the South Asian community in particular. </p> <p>'These girls are caught by a double whammy,' said one refuge worker who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals. 'If they are in a strict environment, they are more likely to suffer abuse. But they are less likely to report it.' </p> <p>Tjinder lives in east London. She is in her twenties, articulate and self-confident. She was married young to a friend of her father's and is now living in a refuge. Through an intermediary she told her story to The Observer . The details are kept vague to protect her and her family. </p> <p>'During the first year of our marriage there were indications my husband was abusive,' she said. 'There were things he would say that I wouldn't like. [Soon] the violence became a regular feature in our lives. I found myself having sex with him to keep him from beating or raping me. I was under enormous pressure not to talk about it.' </p> <p>When Tjinder did tell her in-laws about the assaults, she was told that she 'ought to be careful because as far as everyone in the community was concerned her husband was an honourable man and if she tried to leave him both their izzat would be questioned. When she spoke to her own family about the abuse their response was harsh. </p> <p>'They told me bluntly that no one would take me in... Your brothers are not going to put you up and your father is not going to give you roti (bread). Those were their very words,' Tjinder said. </p> <p>Tjinder was interviewed by Ayesha Gill, a sociologist at the University of Essex. In the past year she has spoken to hundreds of such victims of domestic violence. 'Asian women are taught to hide problems that may bring shame on the family or the community,' she said. Other researchers say the pressure of living up to expectations is a key factor in the high suicide rates for young Asian women. </p> <p>Many of those suicides concern police. In March last year Uzma Shaheen and her two-year-old daughter burnt to death in her own home. Her last words - screamed down the telephone to the emergency services as she choked on the smoke filling her bedroom - blamed her husband for lighting the fire. </p> <p>Shaheen was on the point of leaving her arranged marriage, a court heard this year, and had visited support workers dealing with abused women. Her husband was acquitted of killing her after a judge heard evidence that Shaheen had contemplated burning the house down and committing suicide in the months before her death. </p> <p>Other suicides lead to 'Romeo and Juliet' headlines in newspapers. In one tragic case this year a young Sikh woman hanged herself after being told by her parents that her relationship with a Muslim boy should stop. </p> <p>Such pressure to conform, combined with high expectations, can lead to massive strain on young women. Veena Raleigh, an epidemiologist who has studied suicides among Asian women, said the tight-knit domestic unit with a strong sense of family pride could be a contributory factor. </p> <p>'Such a close institution has tremendous pay-offs such as very low delinquency and very high educational achievement,' she said. 'But a problem is that women have no self-identity. You are a mother or a wife or a sister. You are never yourself. That leads to tremendous pressures.' </p> <p>In some cases suicide has nothing to do with failing to live up to expectations of a loving, if demanding, family. Some of those that Philip Balmforth, the community officer with Bradford police, deals with involve women who have been prisoners in their own homes. He has rescued young Pakistani women who, but for the journey from Manchester airport to a Northern town, have never left their flats or houses. </p> <p>Last winter Balmforth managed to get a woman out of a flat where she had been kept by her husband, a drug user. The marriage had been arranged in Pakistan and the woman could not speak English. 'We had to teach her how to use money, how to use telephones, how to take the bus.' </p> <p> Growing concern about a related issue - forced marriages - recently led the Home Office to set up a working group. Though the analysis was useful, its key achievement was breaking the taboo on publicly speaking about such an subject, experts say. </p> <p>But any government involvement is fraught with difficulty. There are estimated to be only around 100 forced marriages a year. Domestic violence - and the value systems that legitimise it - is a far thornier issue. </p> <p>Some fear that focusing on 'honour and shame' can lead to the Asian community being stigmatised and stereotyped. Baroness Uddin of Bethnal Green, who co-chaired the forced marriages report, told The Observer it risked reinforcing old and dangerous prejudices. </p> <p>However, activists such as Hanana Siddiqui of the Southall Black Sisters, say that, though the Home Office insists 'multicultural sensitivity' will not lead to 'moral blindness', the Government is wary of taking on the leaders of ethnic communities over cultural traditions. </p> <p>It is important to emphasise that, overall, levels of domestic violence in the Asian community in Britain are probably lower than the national average. Nor can religion be blamed. Muslim, Hindu and Sikh religious leaders all stress that their faiths are non-violent and abhor violence to anyone, especially women. Optimists say that, as the Asian community becomes more assimilated and the older, conservative traditionalism dies away, the issue will resolve itself. </p> <p>Often the victims of violence are women born or educated in the UK whose aspirations are very different from those of older family members. </p> <p>Shamshad Hussain, the Bradford community worker, remains worried. Change, she says, has to be carefully managed. </p> <p>'Unless we all unite to take an honest and strong, intelligent and open stance on this issue now, you are likely to see a backlash of traditionalism by young people, particularly young men, as a defence against Western values that threaten them and their traditional position.' </p> <p>For many Asian women in the UK, Hussain points out, it is already too late.</p>",
  "Nice one, boss. The enduring mystery of why we laugh has been solved: we giggle, snigger and chortle to ingratiate ourselves with our superiors. <p>According to new research, laughter is an 'acoustic response to a situation' - the equivalent in humans of birdsong - which is all to do with social signals and very little to do with humour. </p> <p>Even a baby will laugh into its parents' delighted faces because it is pre-programmed to please its providers. </p> <p>A team from the University of Maryland in Baltimore, led by neurobiology and psychology professor Robert Provine, have collected 1,200 'laugh episodes' by eavesdropping on people in public places around the world. </p> <p>The results show that people in power rarely snigger, although everyone will laugh more with dominant individuals, whether tribal elders or employers, than with equals. In short, when the boss laughs, everyone laughs. The pattern holds true around the world. In India, men of lower castes giggle when addressing men of higher castes, but never the other way round. </p> <p>'They are controlling the emotional climate of the group,' said Provine, whose book, Laughter: A Scientific Investigation, is published in the US next week. Provine goes as far as to say that giggling may be a feminist issue: women are far more likely to laugh at men - and ingratiate themselves with the opposite sex - than men at women. </p> <p>Listeners, especially women, laugh more often when the speaker is male. </p> <p>Earlier studies have shown that people are 30 times more likely to laugh in social settings than when they are on their own. </p> <p>Even nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, loses its effect if someone takes it when they are alone, according to experiments done by German psychologist Willibald Ruch at the University of D\u00fcsseldorf. </p> <p>'Laughter is only rarely a response to jokes,' Provine said. 'It is the quintessential human social signal. It solidifies relationships and pulls people into the fold.' </p> <p>The oft-heard clich\u00e9 of the 'evil laugh' is true. </p> <p>The two teenage Columbine High school killers who laughed as they killed classmates were showing solidarity with each other and a dismissiveness towards their terrified targets, said Provine. </p> <p>'Laughter is a probe into such fundamental questions as why humans can speak but other apes can't,' he said. </p> <p>A laugh is usually one short exhalation of breath chopped into staccato segments lasting a fifteenth of a second each and spaced one-fifth of a second apart. </p> <p>Laughter is also contagious: in 1962 an epidemic of laughter among African schoolgirls in Tanganyika lasted for six months and forced officials to close down the schools. </p> <p>But while you can catch it from others, you cannot induce it in yourself. </p> <p>Even tickling yourself is a non-starter. Now experiments by Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, of University College London, may have finally revealed why that is. The neuroscientist used brain scans to look at the responses of volunteers who either tickled themselves or were tickled by a robotic tickler. </p> <p>She found that when you move your hand to tickle yourself, your brain predicts your moves and blocks the sensory response. If someone else tickles you, it is a surprise and the brain cannot control the touch. </p> <p>Laughing so hard that you have to hold on to something becomes 'a signal of trust in one's companions, a ritual disarming in effect,' said Provine. </p> <p>Provine says laughter, like most human behaviour, has evolved through communication. </p> <p>In an embarrassing or threatening situation, laughing may deflect anger. If an aggressor joins in, the risk of confrontation may become less.</p>",
  "King George V, the obsessively correct monarch who died after uttering the famous profanity 'Bugger Bognor', interfered so much in the military operations of the First World War that the Prime Minister threatened to resign, according to new research. <p>The monarch not only considered turning out the politicians and installing a military government in their place, but repeatedly blocked political appointments and installed officers loyal to his camp instead. </p> <p>The revelation that the king wielded such power will shock many experts because of the monarch's determination to conceal the true extent of his involvement. Documents describing the king's interference were uncovered by Professor Ian Beckett, one of Britain's leading military experts, during rare access to archives at Windsor Castle. </p> <p>Beckett discovered that, although the monarch ensured that he appeared to be on the periphery of the war effort, he was so determined to control the armed forces that David Lloyd George accused him of attempting to form a military dictatorship. </p> <p>Beckett, whose essay will appear in Leadership in Conflict, to be published next month, found that the king's interference reached such a height that the Prime Minister accused him of inciting an armed forces' mutiny. </p> <p>The climax was when Lloyd George threatened to provoke the Government's resignation, forcing the king into a more hands-off app-roach. 'He [the king] was a blunt and powerful man who believed firmly in his right to govern and was not afraid to express his displeasure,' said Beckett. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk  \">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk </a></p>",
  "On 3 September you published an article on the future ethnic composition of the UK.

  "For nearly two decades, he was the world's most notorious and feared terrorist, a defiant killer who claimed responsibility for the deaths of 83 people and was linked to the most audacious hijackings of the Cold War era. Since being imprisoned in Paris's La Sant\u00e9 prison in 1994, however, little has been heard from Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez, better known as Carlos the Jackal. <p>But, replying in writing to questions from a French magazine, the 51-year-old spoke freely about his reign of terror. He relished describing his years of cocaine, women and bombings - and recalled his betrayal by the socialist and Arab states who protected and sponsored him in the Seventies and Eighties. </p> <p>Ram\u00edrez appeared laconic and unrepentant. By turns light-hearted and then spouting the anti-imperialist rhetoric that marks him out as a Cold War throwback, the former international revolutionary described himself as 'an old lag'. But he still complained about the conditions of his imprisonment: 'Total isolation, visits forbidden, thus all activity. I'm even forbidden French lessons!' </p> <p>He says: 'Each day I read the paper and listen to news on the radio and I'm allowed two walks of an hour each. Each night I read, I write, and sometimes I watch the television - news disinformation programmes. Sometimes I tune into Radio Latina, megaphone of the Colombian olig-archy.' Asked what he missed most, Ram\u00edrez replied: 'Above all, the warmth of my two wives, and also ... the warmth of my next wife!' </p> <p>The Venezuelan-born terrorist is serving a life sentence for the murders of two French Secret Service agents and a Lebanese national during a gun battle at his Left Bank apartmentin 1975. He is widely believed to be responsible for the seizure of 11 Opec Oil Ministers in Vienna in 1975 and the 1976 Palestinian hijacking of an Air France jet to Uganda. He has also been linked to the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and is still under investigation for four terrorist bombings in France. </p> <p>Replying to Le Vrai Papier Journal , Ram\u00edrez expressed no remorse. 'Our \"collateral damage\" (as the Nato jargon has it) is nothing compared with the dismemberment of Yugoslavia, not to mention the other aggressive wars which stain the French flag with innocent blood.' </p> <p>Ram\u00edrez had a private army of terrorists for hire that operated out of Eastern Europe. 'We could go freely to all the socialist countries, 10 sub-Saharan countries, the majority of Arab countries, and four Asian countries. That's to say, their security services would not threaten us.' </p> <p>Asked if he had become an irrelevance, the terrorist replied: 'My actions and those that continue to be led by my comrades play a role, minor but not negligible, in the anti-imperialist struggle.' </p> <p>But Ram\u00edrez conceded that the days during which he was protected by Libya's Colonel Gadaffi, Syria's President al-Assad, the Stasi secret police in East Germany, among others, were over thanks to the accommodations that Arab and former socialist states had made with the West in recent years. </p> <p>'From the arrival in the Kremlin of Yuri Andropov (pupil of Beria), the Warsaw Pact countries became hostile to revolutionaries. The Arab countries, submitting to the Yankee swinging of the stick \"anti-terrorism\" and the carrot of \"financial aid\", were pushed to betray the militants on their territory. Syria is the best example of it.' </p> <p>The CIA and French Secret Services gave themselves licence to kill Ram\u00edrez, who sought sanctuary in Sudan. But he was betrayed by the very leaders of the country's Islamic revolution who had offered him protection. His drinking and womanising upset those leaders, who concluded he could not be trusted. 'Henceforth, I intend to turn away from women and cocaine, to put myself in conformity with the new republican morality,' he said sardonically. He claimed he was betrayed by the Sudanese 'for money'. In 1994 French agents, eager to seek revenge for the killings of colleagues nearly 20 years earlier in Paris, abducted him from his villa near Khartoum with the assistance of the Sudanese, drugged him and hauled him back to Paris in a sack to stand trial. Ram\u00edrez maintains the abduction was illegal. </p> <p>Did he fear assassination now? 'Jean Baklouti (former assistant director of the French security services) said that he had attempted 33 actions against me! How many more must have been tried by other countries. I don't fear for my life. I am a Muslim!' What did he want inscribed on his tomb? 'Below my name, this: \"Salim Saliom Mohammed - Habib Allah\".' </p> <p>In a letter to Jeune Afrique magazine two years ago, Ram\u00edrez nominated Osama bin Laden as his successor to lead the struggle against 'imperialist aggression'. He hailed the Saudi dissident as the new scourge of the West. </p> <p>Asked now if there is a 'nouveau Carlos', the terrorist replied: 'Is that a new commercial product cloned from Beaujolais?' Then he added: 'Before me there was a Carlos, and there will be others, rest assured.'</p>",
  "<p>Herbert Ypma has one of the most enviable of lives. He spends his days researching glossy, coffee table books about hotels and interiors. His Hip Hotels series has given him the perfect reason (as if any were needed) to travel to exotic and far-flung destinations and check into some of the world's most luxurious and stylish hotels. His books on interiors and architecture have taken him from Mexico to Morocco, where he photographs kasbahs, mud castles, hotels and markets, designed to inspire, and make his readers dream. In Sweden, he has explored the Ice Hotel which is allowed to melt each year and is then rebuilt; in Chile, he has sought out the remote Hotel Explora, perched high above a waterfall in the wilds of Patagonia.</p> <p>Needless to say, he's a hard man to track down. His publishers never know quite where he is, or where he might be going. He himself is not quite sure where he lives anymore. Hip Hotels France will be out next spring. Right now he's working on the next volume of Hip Hotels, an edition devoted to interesting and unusual places to stay for between \u00a320 and \u00a380. </p> <p>In between Hip Hotels, however, Ypma has been spending quite a lot of time in Paris, working on his new book, The Paris Interior, to be published in early November. The aim of the book, he says, was to define the very essence of the Parisian interior. There are mountains of books out there covering everything from Paris apartments, monuments, caf\u00e9s and restaurants to bridges and metro stations, but they all, he says, miss the point. His idea was to spell out the precise elements that add up to the typical Parisian interior. </p> <p>'Whether in an ad for perfume or a film by the likes of Polanski or Bertolucci,' he writes in the introduction, 'we recognise a Parisian setting before we are told - if indeed we are told at all. Why? Because there is a visual language at play that is unique to Paris.' It starts with the Louis XVI chair, and goes right through to the wooden panels of the boiserie, integral to most apartments in the city. </p> <p>'You cannot separate the history of Paris and its interiors,' he explains on the phone during a brief touchdown somewhere in France. 'There are definite things that you can pinpoint as Parisian style.' Element number one is undoubtedly the Louis XVI chair. 'It's an incredibly well-designed piece of furniture,' he says, a design classic that is simultaneously of its time and timeless, more popular now (in terms of numbers produced) than at the time of the Bourbons. Then, the nobility would muse over the design and detail of their specially commissioned chair for days on end. It was their status symbol, in the same way as a certain car or handbag might be today.</p> <p>'It was a period when furniture manufacturing was briefly elevated to the status of high art,' he writes. Each chair would have been painstakingly hand-made by specialist craftsmen. Louis XV's bureau du roi took a team of craftspeople seven years to finish, and every chair that was commissioned for his palace would have been given the same treatment. </p> <p>It is this understanding and love of the art and craft of furniture that has helped to define the Parisian style. In Britain, the Industrial Revolution was all about mass-production and cutting costs. In France, however, there was a culture of making large numbers of a product, but by hand - irrespective of the amount it would cost or the time it would take. There is an ingrained love of luxury, although today it is the style and shape of the furniture made for Louis XV and XVI that are imitated, rather than the quality of the craftsman-ship. 'It is almost impossible to conceive of a stylish Paris interior without its Louis XV or Louis XVI chairs: whether upholstered with tapestry or plain silk, they can be found in almost every grand hotel or chic apartment.' Oh, and if you are wondering, the way to i tell the difference between Louis XV and XVI is simple: just take a look at the legs. </p> <p>The earlier king favoured curved legs, while Louis XVI preferred his straight and tapered. </p> <p>Paris interiors did not end with the 18th century, however. According to Ypma, they are very much alive and well today. Alongside the elements of style guaranteed to make an appearance in the Parisian apartment, including the clock, ('They were such objects of desire,' he says. 'If you commissioned a clock, you would have it made in your style'), chinoiserie, wood panelling, parquet floors, and the odd touch of the rococo, is the objet trouv\u00e9. </p> <p>'I think history can be really intriguing and fascinating,' says Ypma. 'An apartment without something from the past lacks a story.' And the perfect place to find something with a story is the flea market. Paris has several, from Clignancourt to Porte de Montreuil, each throwing up a seemingly endless supply of antiques, junk, novelties and - a favourite of Ypma's - copper pots. Sunday mornings are the time to go out in search of that Louis chair, the little crystal chandelier, or the baroque candlestick. The more faded and distressed, the better. It's all about character and eclecticism; bringing the interiors and furniture of the past to life by mixing unusual pieces, and making something out of nothing. </p> <p>Although Ypma himself does not have a Paris apartment, he has had no shortage of rooms to inspire him. He visits the city about 20 times a year, and is, of course, no stranger to some of the best and most characterful hotels. There's the Montalambert on the Left Bank, which he says is 'pretty, small and elegantly designed'; L'Hotel, near the Ecole des Beaux Arts, where all the rooms are different and 'very funky, if a little run down'; or the Lancaster, which is more traditional and classical. Even if he doesn't know where he is going to be from one week to the next, one thing is for sure: wherever he is in Paris, he can feel secure that there will be a Louis XVI chair to rest his weary, well-travelled legs.</p>",
  "All parents of young children dread the 'terrible twos', when seemingly overnight their charming toddler mutates into a raging monster. But when Alice Ford turned two it was different. <p>A family holiday abroad descended into nightmare for parents Andy and Angie. By the end of the short flight, Andy had blood running down his neck where Alice had torn at him with her nails. During the stay, Alice had not only pushed another child into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he had to be rescued by lifeguards, but she had also shoved an entire restaurant table into the harbour.</p> <p>For Andy, a computer-company project manager, and Angie, a teacher, who live in Sheffield, it was the last straw. They had been concerned for some time that Alice's development seemed slow, her speech poor and her hearing variable. But every time they raised their anxieties with health professionals they were told not to worry. Even though Alice failed her health visitor's hearing test at nine months, they were reassured when she sailed through the re-test weeks later and passed a further test, for speech, at 18 months. Returning from holiday, they were so desperate that they consulted a child psychologist, who recommended simply ignoring Alice for two hours every time she misbehaved. </p> <p>After a few weeks, she was transformed into a calm, compliant child. With hindsight, Andy believes it was the cruellest thing he has ever done. 'We are wracked with guilt about it,' he says. 'It breaks my heart.'</p> <p>What Andy and Angie now know is that Alice is deaf. She was born deaf. Yet, despite her parents' repeated concerns and after numerous tests, Alice's deafness was not diagnosed until she was more than three-and-a-half years old. By this time, Andy and Angie were so convinced she could not hear that they did their own test - hiding behind Alice and asking her to repeat words. Alice, it transpired, had somehow taught herself to lip-read. Once a speaker was out of sight, she failed to respond.</p> <p>Finally, the Fords were granted a thorough hospital hearing check which proved Alice had moderate to severe hearing loss. She was almost four - just two months off starting school - by the time she had hearing aids fitted. Andy remembers the moment well. 'She smiled the most enormous smile she had ever smiled in her life,' he says.</p> <p>Now 11, Alice has just started secondary school after doing well in her junior-school exams. But Andy is certain her education has suffered from her late diagnosis. </p> <p>'I think it took her virtually all of junior school to catch up,' he says. What makes matters worse is knowing that Alice's deafness could have been detected within a few days of birth through a simple, quick and safe test developed more than 10 years ago, but still not universally available.</p> <p>About 840 children are born each year in the UK with permanent deafness, mainly due to genetic damage to the cochlea or auditory nerve. So it makes sense that all children are called at around eight months old for a routine hearing test performed by health visitors to detect permanent hearing problems.</p> <p>The trouble is that the check, called the infant distraction test, is woefully unreliable. It detects at best 60 per cent, at worst 18 per cent, of permanent hearing loss, according to studies. Like Alice, many deaf children sail through with flying colours, while children with perfect hearing frequently fail and have to go for further checks. In fact, most hearing problems are actually detected by parents or health professionals independently of the test. Even so, more than half of children born deaf are still undiagnosed at 18 months, and a quarter are not diagnosed until more than three-and-a-half, according to the National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS). Late diagnosis, the society warns, delays giving vital help to deaf children - such as hearing aids and cochlea implants - and can cause lasting problems with the child's language, education, behaviour and even mental health.</p> <p>Yet there is a test, the transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) test, which can be done in hospital within days of birth, by inserting a tiny probe into a baby's ear, and which is almost foolproof. Developed in the 80s, it takes minutes, is totally safe and costs less than the health-visitor test. But the TEOAE is performed routinely on newborn babies in just a handful of UK hospitals. Generally, it is used only when family history suggests a baby might be deaf, despite the fact that 90 per cent of deaf children are born to families with no such history.</p> <p>This summer, the government announced pilot studies beginning next year to introduce TEOAE for all newborn children in 20 areas in England. But national TEOAE screening of all babies - replacing the health-visitor test - will not begin until possibly two or three years later. In that time, another 400 deaf children a year will go undiagnosed, and suffer in silence, like Alice.</p> <p>Evidence that the TEOAE works better than the infant-distraction test is already inarguable, according to John Bamford, professor of audiology at Manchester University. A study comparing the two tests found 96 per cent of deaf children were identified by nine months with the TEOAE but only half with the health-visitors' test.</p> <p>The main problem, he says, is that the infant-distraction test is subjective and dependent on circumstances. Introduced nationally in the 60s, it involves two health visitors: one holding the baby's attention, while the other stands behind the child making noises with special rattles and other equipment. Hearing is assessed by the baby's ability to turn towards the sounds. But in a busy health clinic, the test is often distorted because babies turn towards other noises, shadows, and even a health visitor's perfume. This means deaf children often pass the test while hearing children fail, causing unnecessary anxiety for parents and clogging up hospital clinics.</p> <p>The TEOAE is not only significantly better at detecting deafness, it also does it earlier, allowing help to be given sooner. Bamford says: 'There is now quite good emerging data that the earlier you identify children with a significant hearing problem and offer intervention - whether parental information or devices like hearing aids - the quicker the benefits.'</p> <p>An expert group investigating the issue, for which Professor Bamford was a member, recommended national TEOAE screening in 1997. Further delay means more deaf children will go undiagnosed and untreated before national screening comes in, warns Bamford, although he accepts the need to iron out teething problems through pilot studies.</p> <p>Even health visitors support abandoning their test in favour of neonatal screening but, according to the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association, they also back pilots first.</p> <p>Susan Daniels, chief executive of the NDCS, which has campaigned for over 10 years for neonatal screening, is less content. Although delighted at the government's pledge to bring in national newborn screening, the 'most important development for deaf children since the invention of the hearing aid,' she sees no reason to wait.</p> <p>'We believe there is enough information today, from the States and other areas in Europe doing national screening, to be able to roll this out as soon as possible,' she says. Indeed, a law was passed in the US last year supporting newborn-deafness screening in every state. She adds: 'The importance of early diagnosis just cannot be overestimated. Parents need to know as soon as they possibly can.'</p> <p>Diana Glover, who has two out of three sons born deaf, supports that whole-heartedly. Second son Robin's hearing problems were dismissed by health professionals as 'glue ear', a common childhood complaint when fluid gathers behind the eardrum, until he was finally diagnosed with profound deafness at 19 months. Younger brother Benjamin was diagnosed within weeks of birth and had hearing aids fitted at three months, followed by a cochlea implant at two years. The difference, she says, is still obvious. Robin, now 17, is studying A levels at a school for deaf children and still struggles with language, while Benjamin, eight, is managing well in mainstream education.</p> <p>'I can see, with two deaf boys, the difference that early diagnosis makes,' says Diana. 'If you find out your child is deaf it is going to be a shock anyway, but if you have time on your side to make important decisions and for them to get used to hearing aids, it's so much more rewarding than finding you have missed so many crucial months and they are way behind.'</p> <p><b>Now hear this</b></p> <p>About one in every 1,000 babies is born deaf in the UK. A further 160 children become permanently deaf every year, mostly through meningitis. In addition, most children under five have bouts of 'glue ear', but this normally clears up on its own.</p> <p>Only a handful of UK hospitals perform the transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) test on newborn babies. Most only do the test when there is a family history of deafness. Almost all health districts invite children for the infant-distraction test, performed by health visitors, at between six to nine months. Nine out of 10 British children undergo this test. Studies show its success in detecting hearing problems varies from 18 to 60 per cent. Most children who fail the test have normal hearing. The government has promised to introduce national neonatal screening using the TEOAE test - but not until it analyses the results of 20 pilot studies due to begin next year.</p> <p>\u0095 If you're worried about your child's hearing, call the NDCS helpline (020 7250 0123) weekdays 10am-5pm.</p>",
  "<p>Isabel Maxwell is decapitating a boiled egg. It is her second of the morning. The first was too hard. Unfortunately, the second is no better. 'I guess that's England for you, hard boiled,' she shrugs. </p> <p>It is a funny aside, one of many she will doubtless make throughout the course of the day. But it has an edge. She might have an Oxford education, but the daughter of Robert Maxwell doesn't spend too much time here any more. Too much history. Too much baggage. A hard-nosed, hard-boiled country that will always remember the sins of the father. </p> <p>Instead, these days Maxwell prefers to swim in a different pond, one where people are not too interested in your past, just your future. She is a major player in that US home of perpetual reinvention, Silicon Valley. </p> <p>Each day when she's not travelling overseas, Maxwell, one of the late newspaper tycoon's five surviving children, makes the 80-minute 'killer commute' to her company, Commtouch. </p> <p>She doesn't need to do it. Maxwell calls herself a working mum, but this is a woman who, with her twin sister Christine, saw the internet's potential in 1992 and helped build Magellan, a search engine, which they sold to Excite for nearly \u00a34.5 million. </p> <p>However, Maxwell is almost messianic about the company over which she presides. At first glance her enthusiasm is hard to fathom. The Nasdaq-listed company claims to be the world's 'leading provider of outsourced email and messaging solutions'. But this doesn't seem enough to generate the fervour that Maxwell obviously feels for it, and it has yet to deliver the sort of stellar future she is predicting. </p> <p>Commtouch was formed in 1991 to sort out problems that new communications technology would create for companies and consumers: they would spend so much time and money developing new ways of communicating with staff, customers and suppliers that they would lose sight of their core businesses. </p> <p>Commtouch takes over and builds messaging systems not just for blue-chip clients but even for small and medium-sized enterprises. Its versatile services are available in 26 languages. Want to attract visitors to your website? Offer them free email services so they visit regularly. Want to turn the web into a direct marketing tool without being labelled a junk mailer? Commtouch will offer solutions. Almost 20 million mail boxes now depend on its technology. </p> <p>Maxwell clearly believes the firm, which is not due to make a profit until next year, is set for exponential growth. </p> <p>'The need for outsourcing email messaging is incredible,' she says. 'By 2003 it's going to be a $24 billion market, compared with $1bn last year.' </p> <p>The explosion in different communication devices means Commtouch can position itself in the middle of the competing technologies by offering 'unified messaging solutions', shorthand for getting all your equipment - from PCs to Palm Pilots to mobile phones - talking coherently to one another. </p> <p>Maxwell will emphasise these points again and again in the coming weeks. Last Monday she gave a lecture at Durham University, the following day she flew to Paris to spread the company's gospel. By the end of last week she was in Tunisia, addressing the World Congress of Women Entrepreneurs. </p> <p>The congress gave her a chance to talk about one of her favourite themes, the way new technology breaks down old socio-economic barriers. </p> <p>'The wonderful thing about email is it's not sexist,' she says. 'It crosses all boundaries: age, race, religion, geography and gender. In America it's almost 50/50 men and women on the internet, and in Europe women are catching up. It's democratising.' </p> <p>It is a hectic schedule. Does she regret travelling so much? 'I regret...' She pulls herself up, perhaps conscious that some Maxwells are not famous for their regrets. 'I miss my son,' she says after a pause. </p> <p>At first glance the prosaic world of outsourced messaging seems a world away from Maxwell's first job as a television journalist. But then it seems all of Maxwell's life she has been focusing on communication. She started off at Oxford doing a law and history degree but switched to modern languages. After working for a couple of UK regional TV stations she worked in California as an independent filmmaker. And Magellan, too, was an attempt to simplify communication. </p> <p>Perhaps it comes from her father. 'He'd love it [the internet] if he was still here. He was very prescient. He was doing online stuff back in the late Sixties. He'd be in his element, he'd be having a blast, I'm sure he'd be thrilled to know what I'm doing now,' Maxwell says, throwing back her head and laughing loudly. </p> <p>Does she tire of people asking about her father, the Mirror pension plunderer who died mysteriously in 1992? The laughter reaches a crescendo. Maxwell shakes her head: 'I am who I am. It's a legacy.' </p> <p>Even outside her professional life Maxwell seems keen to promote communication in the widest sense. She is a governor of the Peres Centre for Peace, in Tel Aviv. </p> <p>'I'm optimistic about being able to help. I don't have starry eyes about making some mega-change. War seems to be sexy. Peace is not. But get the economic process going, and the bombs stop.' </p> <p>She takes succour from the fact that the likes of Wal-Mart are moving into the Middle East. 'Too much good living has started for it to go back to another war. Yes, there'll be more terrorism, but there definitely won't be another war.' </p> <p>Commtouch, an Israeli company, was attracted to Maxwell's optimism when it head-hunted her in 1997. Maxwell says it is the embodiment of the Israeli business culture. 'It's cohesive, innovative, disciplined' - and she is having the best 'corporate work experience' of her life. </p> <p>Admittedly, it has been hit by the slump in hi-tech stocks, but Maxwell is san guine about it. 'If you look on the bottom of the market floor now it's just debris. Everyone's been battered.' The fact that big names such as Microsoft have bought into the company suggests Commtouch is better positioned to take the pain than many. </p> <p>Maxwell jokes about persuading Bill Gates to make a personal investment in the business. In a faux southern belle accent, she purrs: 'He's got to spend $375m a year to keep his tax free status, why not allow me to help him.' She explodes with laughter. </p> <p>Several times after the interview she rings to reiter ate facts and stress points.

  "<p>Martin Evans is a potato farmer in Pembroke. For 26 years, this 48-year-old fourth-generation Welsh farmer has sown up to 100 acres, producing 1,500 tonnes of the crop each spring. But next year he will cut back sharply, and in 2002 pack it in altogether. </p> <p>The reason is straightforward: like thousands of small farmers around Britain, Evans simply cannot make a living. Nor, dependent on the whims of the big supermarkets, can he afford to take the risk of the chains wriggling out of contracts when the next cheap boatload docks from Jersey or Cyprus. </p> <p>This June, Evans received just 3.4p for every pound of spuds, compared with the 28p Tesco is charging at its new superstore down the road at Pembroke Dock. And, like every lamb and beef farmer in the land, he is furious that the long-awaited Competition Commission report has cleared the big chains of not passing derisory farmgate prices on to the consumer. </p> <p>'It's absolute rubbish. Tesco haven't dropped their prices,' he says. 'I'm not making any money now. I used to. And supermarkets, because they now control so much of the market, are a big part of the reason why.' </p> <p>Protests, three years ago, by Evans and his West Wales brethren were instrumental in starting an Office of Fair Trading inquiry into supermarket power in 1998 and then the Competition Commission investigation 16 months ago. As revealed in The Observer last week, the commission's still unpublished report finds the biggest chains guilty of acting against the public interest by overcharging in areas where they face little competition and by drawing customers in with loss-leading prices on staples like bread and milk. But, to widespread anger last week, it concludes that nothing can be done to stop them. </p> <p>We can also reveal the report finds that the big supermarkets abuse their buying power by screwing down suppliers, who include small farmers like Evans right at the bottom of the food chain. 'There appeared to us to be a \"climate of fear\" among many suppliers in their relationship with the supermarkets,' the commission concludes. 'Suppliers commonly alleged they were expected to comply with requests for payments, discounts and other concessions if they were to retain their business, or their current level of business, with a multiple. We believe them.' </p> <p>The commission finds that out of the 42 allegedly bullying practices investigated in detail, 31 adversely affected suppliers and distorted competition. Moreover, 23 of Britain's 24 biggest chains are guilty of using one or more of the tactics. And, the report concludes, the biggest five buyers - Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Safeway and Somerfield - form a 'complex monopoly', many of whose buying activities operate against the public interest. </p> <p>Vulnerable consumers, who use the corner shop, also suffer. Together, the five chains control more than 75 per cent of supermarket grocery purchases. And, screwed by the big chains, suppliers are forced to charge higher prices to small grocers, the report finds. </p> <p>'We also take the view that the cumulative effect of the practices is likely to be particularly adverse for the competitiveness of suppliers,' the report says. 'It will increase the risk that suppliers may not only reduce their product development but actually exit from the market.' </p> <p>Jane Howells, another Pembrokeshire farmer, has vowed never to deal with a supermarket again. A former official of the Farmers Union of Wales, she is now converting her 170-acre farm to produce organic Aberdeen Angus beef for sale in farm shops, door-to-door or over the internet. Three years ago, she bred dairy calves, but got out when the milk price collapsed. Now it will be another two years before her 112 head of Angus are ready and the family makes a living again. </p> <p>'Our biggest problem is that supermarkets know our milk, beef and produce have a limited shelf life. They know they don't have to pay a reasonable price. They're laughing,' she says. 'But they may not just drop their price. They may decide your cauliflowers are the wrong colour or your potatoes the wrong shape. They're clever. The goalposts move all the time. Anything to get round a contract.' </p> <p>On several complaints alleging sharp practice, the report makes no findings. There's the Tredegar baker asked by her bread supplier, under pressure from Tesco whom she was undercutting, to raise her prices. The manager concerned, Tesco told the commission, 'had acted against company policy'. There's the Cornish cauliflower grower who alleged Tesco pressured other suppliers not to handle its produce. Like several other cases, that was one firm's word against another or a 'one-off', the commission concludes. </p> <p>But the bullying which the report does pin down puts the industry firmly in the dock. Some of the more eyebrow-raising tactics include: demanding money for stocking items at all or for new store openings and refurbishment; requiring contributions to charities when the chain gets all the kudos; chipping away at contracts by insisting on all sorts of retrospective discounts; and forcing suppliers to use particular transport or packaging firms, which then pay commission to some of the supermarkets. </p> <p>The report also paints a picture of very grudging co-operation with the commission by the market leader, Tesco, in particular. While rivals Sainsbury, Safeway and Asda freely admit to some of the practices, in the main Tesco fired off the same blanket response: 'It is not company practice nor policy to engage in them.' Yet some of the practices were found to be widespread at the chain. </p> <p>'Tesco said we could not find it to be a member of a complex monopoly group on the basis of activities that it had carried out which were not the company's policy or practice,' the report says. 'We are not convinced by this argument. Moreover, we do not find it acceptable for a multiple to shield behind the actions of its buyers on the grounds that what may have occurred is not company policy. It is the responsibility of the company to see that its employees follow that policy.' </p> <p>In response, the commission recommends a code of practice banning many of the most blatant bullying tactics, including payment of shelf fees, retrospective discounts and contract changes, and interference in suppliers' other business. The provisions, to be approved by the Director General of Fair Trading, go further than most supermarkets would like. But, as a voluntary system, the commission's proposals still fail to meet many suppliers' demands for the law to be used to enforce fairer play. </p> <p>'I don't think any of us thought the commission was going to change anything, given the power of the supermarkets,' said Jane Howells. 'I'd have sleepless nights if I thought I'd have to deal with a supermarket again.' </p> <p>After years of complaining, farmers are also amazed at one glaring hole in the report. Namely, while focusing on the effects of 'persistent below-cost selling' of the likes of milk and bread on grocers and consumers, the toll on farmers and growers is largely ignored. </p> <p>After 21 years, in 1996, Martin Evans also quit dairy farming just before the bottom fell out of the market. 'I'm so pleased. Dairy was doing all right. Then you got 22p a litre, but now they're actually selling the stuff for 16p. The business is really struggling. The calves are worth nothing and the dairy boys are really suffering.'</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair is the best Prime Minister we have, and the Conservative Party is running out of feet in which to shoot itself. </p> <p>This seems to be the message of the recent seaside conference season, which has also seen the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, go from strength to strength, during intervals between his trips to the Group of Seven and International Monetary Fund meetings in Prague. </p> <p>Whatever else they have done, the revolts on the petrol and pensions front have shaken New Labour out of its complacency and forced it to listen. If it does not go on doing so, the Government faces not so much a threat from enthusiasts shouting, 'Don't be vague, vote for Hague' as the kind of mass abstention that has afflicted Labour in most local and European elections since 1 May 1997. </p> <p>The Conservatives' principal problem continues to be that New Labour has stolen most of its clothes. Labour's problem is that, unless it shows some respect for these embarrassing elderly relations who constitute its core vote, it could yet screw up its best mandate since 1945. </p> <p>Labour needed a shock, and it has received several. This is no bad thing. Provided the Government shows that it has learnt something from recent grass-roots revolts, it - and we - should be all the better for the experience. The position of the parties is reversed, but there are parallels with 1982-1983, when, for various reasons, Labour was deemed unelectable and Margaret Thatcher, however unpopular her domestic policies (as opposed to her Falklands policies), was given another chance. </p> <p>The main difference is that whereas Thatcher Mark One had made an unholy mess of the economy, Labour under Brown's chancellorship is generally credited with remarkably good economic stewardship. </p> <p>While admiring much of what he has achieved, some of us have had reservations about two principal areas: one is the way the combination of Gordonian economy and Treasury parsimony have produced a number of mean-minded decisions - on single mothers; on pensions in general and war widows in particular; and on student grants or the lack of them. All these are unworthy of a left-wing government with a budget surplus that would have embarrassed even Gladstone. </p> <p>The Conservatives have been too stupid by half in trying to trump Labour on public expenditure. What their claims really boil down to is that they will spend more than Labour does now on this or that public service, simply because in the natural way of things public expenditure is likely to grow year by year anyway. Its growth would be less than under Labour's current plans, that's all. </p> <p>And anyone who puts his or her faith in the insurance companies as a way of augmenting the good work of the beleaguered health service is referred to the article that a lifelong believer in private insurance, the late Jock Bruce-Gardyne, wrote in the Spectator when the time came for him to collect from Bupa and it was found wanting in his hour of need. </p> <p>The Government is certainly spending on the public services from now on, but one continues to wonder whether it was really necessary to have that two-year freeze at the beginning. </p> <p>The second reservation about Brown's stewardship has been the 'hands-off' attitude towards a pound which has been so high that it has been damaging two vital sectors, manufacturing industry and agriculture. An exchange rate regime in which Nissan's European showpiece factory in Sunderland struggles to make money is one that is seriously out of kilter. </p> <p>There are always time lags in these matters, and the full force of the regime has not yet been felt in an economy that has profited from a combination of a global economic boom and the relative absence of inflationary pressure - an absence not uncon nected with the fierce international competition associated with the phenomenon known as 'globalisation'. </p> <p>The impressive collection of economic experts who produced the Liberal Democrats' recent pamphlet Britain's Adoption of the Euro concluded that the range of 'possible sustainable entry rates' was between DM2.45 to DM2.84, against around DM3.25 now. </p> <p>In Prague, the Chancellor told a press conference, against the background of the G7 intervention to stabilise the euro, that the current sterling/euro rate was 'not justified by fundamentals' and, again 'not justified by any look at long-term fundamentals'. Admittedly Brown had made the same point earlier in the summer in his James Meade lecture at the London School of Economics; but, taken in the context of Britain's participation in the G7 operation, this began to sound like a major change of policy and an attempt, at last, to encourage the pound down to more realistic and sustainable levels. </p> <p>Alas, when the details of the G7 intervention were duly published last week, it turned out that Britain's participation in the multi-billion dollar support for the euro was a mere $70 million or so, and that it sold the euros the same day. This makes Britain sound not so much like a member of the G7 as half a member. It was the first time the British establishment had intervened in the market for sterling against European currencies since Black Wednesday (16 September 1992), although there may have been some intervention later in that decade vis-a-vis the yen. </p> <p>So, it was a major change of policy - and it lasted several hours. The Treasury is now busily briefing that its intention was to strengthen the euro, not weaken the pound for domestic reasons. </p> <p>The Bank of England can, within its restricted balance sheet, intervene to lower the pound but only, as I understand it, as part and parcel of its remit to achieve the inflation target. Some members of the Monetary Policy Committee have favoured intervention, but they have been outnumbered. </p> <p>Still, we have it on record that Brown thinks the pound is overvalued, even if he is reluctant to draw the obvious operational conclusion. At least the implication is that he thinks it's overvalued. For all we know he may believe it is fundamentally undervalued. </p> <p>So there we have it. The Treasury has dipped a toe in the intervention waters - but only a contorted little toe.</p>",
  "<p>As far as Billy Gilman is concerned, 1991 is, like, ancient history. Not because he was only three at the time, but because those were the days when his family 'didn't even have cable. We only had five or six channels, and Sesame Street was a big deal... LONG time ago!' It was, however, the time when, watching Pam Tillis sing 'Cleopatra, Queen of Denial', Billy Gilman discovered country music, and decided that he wanted to be a star. </p> <p>Now aged 12, a mere 10 weeks after releasing his debut album, he is the youngest ever person to go platinum (one million copies) in the States, and has just recorded a duet with Charlotte Church in an effort to break Britain. Billy himself does not tell me this; it is his pretty blonde tour manager, Elly, who furnishes me with the precise sales figures. 'Stop it!' yells Billy, 'I'm blushing!' He's not. So how does it feel to be so successful, Billy? 'It's awesome. Platinum in 10 weeks! What else could I accomplish?' He says this in more or less the same tone of voice that Hitler probably used after conquering Poland. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: Billy Gilman is cute as a button. Tousled hair, perfect skin, big loud friendly voice, and extensive dental work. The ideal American kid. But when you hear him talking about 'renegotiating with Sony' or his 'densely populated' hometown in Rhode Island, it's easy to think you're listening to some world-weary, hard-nosed fortysomething, rather than a 4ft 7in preteen with take-home pay of $5 a week. </p> <p>Take the dental work, for instance. It happened on 20 June this year, when Billy was taking a golf lesson. Another kid - 'who had probably never hit a golf ball before in his life' - pitched a ball straight at Billy's mouth, smashing his two front teeth. Billy's first reaction? 'I was crying! I thought, \"What are Sony going to say?\"' Within a week, a local radio station had produced a billboard of Billy's blown-up face with a hole cut into his mouth, and were challenging golfers to hit a ball through the hole in order to win tickets to see Billy. 'It was real painful,' says Billy, 'but I got good press out of it...' </p> <p>And while all his adolescent friends spend their evenings in the bathroom, imagining what it would be like to touch a girl's breasts, Billy Gilman is screamed at by thousands upon thousands of girls his own age - or even, gasp, older. 'It's awful. Some times they scream so loud that I can't hear myself sing,' he complains. 'They send lots of letters, too. I laugh, because some of them are so... like, one of them spelt \"please\" like \"p-l-e-e-z-e\"!' He snorts with derision. A word of advice to Billy's female admirers: use a dictionary. </p> <p>It's only when he breaks into song - as he does several times during our interview - that you get a glimpse of the child beneath the pragmatic bluster. Preternaturally mature his voice may be, but its clear, high, haunting quality sounds undeniably innocent. On most of the songs on his debut album, One Voice , it is wasted - doing nonsense rhymes over bland, uptempo country-pop tracks - but on the title track (and first single), Billy sings with an angelic passion which will make men stop pistol-whipping their wives this Christmas, and weep, if only for three and a half minutes. </p> <p>A subtle anti-gun anthem, it is accompanied by a brilliant black-and-white video in which Billy looks on compassionately at the young thugs beside him on the school bus, smiling enigmatically at the end when one of them tosses his firearm into a river. Released in the wake of the Columbine high school massacre, it had a profound impact on middle America's psyche. Or profound enough at least to cause a million people to buy the album. </p> <p>I ask Billy whether he's ever seen or even heard about a child with a gun in his hometown. 'Nah,' he smiles, 'It's just kinda general.' Elly interrupts: 'The thing about Billy is that he really likes kids, and he wants little boys and girls to be safe in their houses.' Is that how you feel, Billy? I ask. 'Yeah, sure,' he replies, somewhat less than convincingly. So how did you feel when you heard about the Columbine massacre? 'Well,' he says, brightening, 'we'd just recorded One Voice , and I said to myself, \"Hey, that's gotta be the first single!\" </p> <p>The only point during the interview when Billy Gilman shows the slightest sign of vulnerability is when I mention the low career survival rate of child prodigies. Is he worried about his career going belly-up when his voice breaks? 'A little bit,' he replies, in a quiet voice. And what would he do if his singing career was suddenly flushed down the toilet? 'I'd like to be a veterinarian or a pop manager,' he says. </p> <p>A veterinarian? Oh pleeze! Put it this way: don't ever trust him with your sick puppy, but if your child is a singing star and you want to milk him/her for all they are worth, Billy Gilman would be the perfect manager. </p> <p>One Voice: album 30 Oct, single 20 Nov</p>",
  "<b> Where the Money Is </b> (87 mins, 15) Directed by Marek Kanievska; starring Paul Newman, Linda Fiorentino, Dermot Mulroney <p>There is a mysterious kind of movie title that is not explained in the film itself and demands some special knowledge. A Clockwork Orange, Straw Dogs and O Brother, Where Art Thou? are examples. The amiable <b> Where the Money Is</b>, directed by Marek Kanievska, a British filmmaker best known for Another Country , from a script by three Americans, belongs in this category. </p> <p>Nobody uses the phrase in the film and, surprisingly, it is not in any dictionary of quotations I possess. But it is generally attributed to the legendary American criminal Willie Sutton, who spent most of his life in jail and the rest of it planning heists. Asked in old age why he persisted in robbing banks, Willie replied: 'Because that's where the money is', and it is clear that Henry, the elderly thief played by Paul Newman, is modelled on Willie Sutton. </p> <p>This clever comedy-thriller begins with Henry, a convict well into his seventies, being temporarily installed in a public geriatric hospital in Oregon. He is speechless and paralysed from a stroke two years before, and thus considered harmless by the state and no threat to the largely female inmates. But his notorious career staging ingenious hold-ups coast to coast causes a flutter among his fellow patients and excites the special interest of Carol (the seductive Linda Fiorentino), an attractive nurse whose marriage to her boorish high-school sweetheart, Wayne (Dermot Mulroney), has gone sour. </p> <p>The frustrated Carol suspects that Henry is feigning his condition, or perhaps unconsciously hopes he is. Anyway, after a leisurely, interestingly detailed opening half-hour, she rumbles Henry. </p> <p>Having studied autohypnosis, this brilliant, amoral loner has managed to convince doctors, psychiatrists and warders that he has been permanently incapacitated by the stroke. </p> <p>'It's not enough to play possum,' the sprightly charmer tells his two new pupils. 'You've got to be possum.' That is as good a description of method acting as you can get; Newman and Henry are consummate performers whom you rarely catch acting. </p> <p>Henry subsequently masterminds from his wheel-chair his last big heist. To assist him, he inducts Carol and Wayne into the art of theft, the way Sean Connery does Catherine Zeta Jones in Jon Amiel's Entrapment and Burt Reynolds does Casey Siemaszko in Bill Forsyth's Breaking In (American movies that also happen to have British directors). </p> <p>Wayne wants the wages of sin, but lacks the spirit to enjoy transgression. Carol, on the other hand, becomes radiant, is renewed and liberated by embarking on a life of crime, in a manner reminiscent of Peggy Cummins in the subversive classic Gun Crazy and Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde . However, a violent bout of vomiting before setting out on the final job reveals suppressed qualms and fear. </p> <p>The chosen target is not a bank but an armoured car, and the scheme is to hijack one and then themselves make the nightly collection at supermarkets, bars, filling stations, an amusement park and a sports stadium. 'You don't rob the route, you rob the crew,' says Henry, explaining why they need to study the behaviour of the armoured-car drivers. His object as always is to carry out the operation without shooting; in fact, almost the film's only act of violence comes in some well-deserved revenge on a crooked male nurse. </p> <p>There are some holes in the plot and a few improbabilities in Where the Money Is, but generally this beguiling film goes its antisocial way in a stately, magisterial manner befitting the age and stature of its protagonist and its star. </p> <p>The script is peppered with sharp dialogue that Newman handles impeccably. He tells a cautionary tale about a friend's greyhound on a Florida racetrack that caught up with the hare and was electrocuted - 'He got what he wanted, but not what he expected.' </p> <p>His best line comes when the police surround them at Fiorentino's house and a sheriff barks through a megaphone: 'Come out with your hands on your heads.' Newman's blue eyes sparkle: 'You haven't lived till you've heard someone say that to you.' </p> <p>Newman, who is 75, has said that this will be his last movie. One hopes not, as he has done fine work during the past decade. He emerged on the screen 45 years ago under the shadow of his fellow Actors Studio graduates, Marlon Brando and James Dean, and because of Dean's early death and Brando's professional indolence, he has long since outstripped them. He has also been, while living an orderly life and conducting a disciplined career, a greater rebel than either. </p> <p>Newman has proved himself equally adept at comedy and drama (think of The Sting and Butch Cassidy), though only occasionally has he been an orthodox hero, as in Exodus, one of the few occasions he has played a Jew. </p> <p>His great strength over the years is the insight he has brought to outsiders, anti-authoritarian rebels as different as the eponymous heroes of Hud, Hombre and Cool Hand Luke . </p> <p>On the other hand, he gave one of his finest performances in Mr and Mrs Bridge, playing the very embodiment of middle-class, small-town conformity. </p> <p>Possibly his greatest film is The Hustler (1961), which established him as an actor of stature and, 25 years later, in The Color of Money, Newman was able to revisit the same character, to see how he had changed and grown, and at last win an Oscar.</p>",
  "<p>When Tony Blair invited the great and good to drinks in Downing Street last Wednesday, he managed with jolting suddenness to transform an arcane subject, previously of interest only to design anoraks, into a serious political issue. Every big-spending department from the Treasury to the Foreign Office was dragged in to help launch a policy that purported to show not just why architecture matters to a society, but also set out to demonstrate how to improve the quality of government-sponsored architecture - from law courts to hospitals. </p> <p>Here was the implicit promise of a new generation of social security offices, barracks, embassies and primary schools that would make Britain a byword for great architecture. It would, so Blair and his advisers blithely promised, have the effect not just of producing good buildings, but also of saving money and producing a healthier, happier society. Which is, even with the best will in the world, going a bit far. </p> <p>Given that the guest list included Lord Falconer, the event ran the risk of turning into an embarrassment. A document which talks about construction best practice and value for money does not sit easily with Labour's angst over the Dome. </p> <p>But extraordinarily, just at the same moment that Blair was launching the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment's (CABE) report on government architecture, William Hague, in Rambo mood, promised the Conservative Party conference he would demolish every tower block in sight and address the future of Britain's towns from a new, design-conscious perspective. </p> <p>Hague was missing the point about high-rise living, focusing on an architectural fad of strictly peripheral significance rather than the hard slog of housing policy, just at the moment that high-rise living is again rising to the top of the housing agenda. But what could have become another stick with which to beat the Government's back turned into a safely bipartisan approach. </p> <p>It is safe to assume that both parties had a raft of ulterior motives driving them on to embrace architecture. Not the least of which for New Labour was ridding its embarrassment at the lordly disdain with which Norman St John Stevas presided over the Royal Fine Art Commission. When confronted with the Millennium wheel, he stamped his foot and declared that it was horrid. The Queen Mother's gates in Hyde Park on the other hand were, as far as this constitutional expert was concerned, just lovely. </p> <p>The whole idea of an official arbiter of taste had turned into a laughing stock, apparently driven by arbitrary prejudice more than any objective standard. Not surprisingly the commission was rapidly replaced by CABE when Blair came to power, under the leadership of the well-connected and respected property developer Sir Stuart Lipton. He was responsible for Broadgate, one of the most impressive developments in London for 40 years. </p> <p>The move could be presented as part of Labour's modernising agenda. Lipton was charged not so much with the task of stopping bad buildings from happening, as making it possible for good new buildings to be realised. Instead of vulgar prejudice, CABE's job would be to give Britain's best architects their head. </p> <p>Lipton now has to live up to the rhetoric that accompanied his appointment. Given the context, it is perhaps not surprising that most of CABE's report is full of platitudes about value for money rather than concrete examples. Turning the pages of the report, you find Will Alsop's library in Peckham and Benson and Forsyth's Museum of Scotland cited as examples of great official architecture. Which of course they are. But neither - nor any of the other illustrations - had anything to do with Lipton's initiatives; they all predate CABE. </p> <p>But Lipton does attempt to deal with the most crucial issue, how to create a climate in which Britain opts for the best architectural solution, rather than the most expedient. And on this issue it is still far from clear if the answer is the kind of bureaucratic procedures CABE's document suggests or the headstrong wilfulness of individual clients determined to make their mark.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Noises Off </strong> Lyttelton, London SE1 <br> <strong> Romeo and Juliet </strong> Olivier, SE1 <br> <strong> The Woman Who Swallowed a Pin </strong> Southwark Playhouse, SE1 <br> <strong> Shoot Me In The Heart </strong> Gate, W11 </p> <p>Even before the curtain went up on the first night of <strong> Noises Off</strong> , it was obvious that Michael Frayn had provided the National with another of his hits. As soon as the usual request to silence phones and pagers had been issued - 'noises off', as it were - a mighty peal from a mobile rang defiantly through the auditorium. A plant, presumably, rather than an eerie coincidence? Either way, two of Frayn's points were neatly made. Here's a farce about a farce which shows that timing can make the difference between annoyance and amusement, and a play in which real life unexpectedly takes the stage. </p> <p>Eighteen years after its first performance, the central device of Noises Off is still hilariously effective. The first act shows a repertory company rehearsing a farce, whose title, Nothing On , neatly echoes Frayn's own. Its cast is a gruesome parade of stereotypes: a comic char in a pinny, a dizzy blonde in cami-knickers, a burly robber. Its actors slip in and out of character: a brilliant piece of casting allows Patricia Hodge to slide in a second from gorblimey to cut-glass. </p> <p>For the second act, the stage spins round, and you watch Nothing On being performed as if you were backstage. You see the reverse side of Robert Jones's cleverly tacky design - with its sticky doors, plastic Tudor beams and earwig-size antlers. You see the liaisons between the actors beginning to interfere with their onstage relationships. You see their world-weary control beginning to slip: this, one of them remarks, 'is becoming farcical'. </p> <p>This is wonderfully entertaining. But the really original stroke is the final tweak. There's a third act - so startling that at least one member of the audience was already on his feet thinking it was all over - in which everything unravels, and the satire about farce is engulfed by farce. Here some of Frayn's slow-burning jokes burst into flame. He builds up his gags pyramid-style: in the first scene, every joke has a lot of triggers; in the last, one word - 'Sardinia' comes to mind - is enough to cause a collapse. </p> <p>And here the skill of director Jeremy Sams, who persuaded Frayn to make some elisions in the play, is fully shown. His musical skills - he directed the London production of Spend, Spend, Spend - are valuable here. He choreographs the piece like a ballet, which is what is needed: whole sequences hinge on tripping, leaping, passing, miming. Everything happens at speed; everything happens at the same time. It's a whizz. </p> <p>The National needs this success. No one doubts that Trevor Nunn is a fine director of plays. But there are doubts about his direction of a theatre. The National is looking lopsided at the moment, with Nunn's own productions strong, but too many gaps elsewhere. Where is the new writing? And where are the new directors? </p> <p>What, for example, is the point of subsidising a Royal National Theatre and a Royal Shakespeare Company to do within six months of each other two poor productions of the same Shakespeare play? Twelve weeks ago Stratford hosted a leaden <strong> Romeo and Juliet</strong> ; now Tim Supple has followed suit in the Olivier. </p> <p>Supple's production (to the extent that it is his, as Nunn was called in to help out) is slurrily spoken and moves at a snail's pace. Confusingly set in modern dress but with sword fights, it seems to be propelled by the notion that youthful passion can be evoked by clamour and irritation. </p> <p>When Charlotte Randle's Juliet isn't on the brink of inappropriate jokiness (she nearly falls off the balcony, and almost giggles at 'God knows when we shall meet again') she is racing around the stage, flinging her arms about (she does this at the mention of wings) and stomping. Patrick O'Kane's short-breathed Mercutio spends the whole play in a lather of indignation, which makes sense when he's just been stabbed but means he delivers the Queen Mab speech as if it were an extended insult. Both are gifted actors: something has gone badly wrong with their direction. </p> <p>Blasts of music by Adrian Lee underline points that the verse should make, sometimes in an attempt to give an illusion of exciting movement as men toil round the stage, pushing into place the gargantuan biscuit-coloured screens that make up Robert Innes Hopkins's design. Beverley Klein is a delightfully dirty-minded nurse; Chiwetel Ejiofor's Romeo is graceful. But they are left floundering without support. </p> <p>To glimpse the theatre of the future you have to look elsewhere. At, for example, the Southwark Playhouse, where an investigation of family history - <strong> The Woman Who Swallowed a Pin </strong> - is being enacted. Clare Bayley's promenade play begins as the audience wait in a lane to go into the theatre. Illuminated behind a heavy plastic curtain which gives things the blurred milky look of old film, you see an early twentieth-century scene: a young girl applying for a below-stairs job. You step through the curtain into the actors world, and find yourself outside an old tea warehouse where scenes from past and present are plaited together. </p> <p>A young, pregnant wo man moves into an old building and begins to uncover its history. She is set on recovering her family's past, seeing her history of miscarriages as linked to the story of an ancestor who lost eight children. Recovering the past may mean securing the future. </p> <p>A guide, so tactful as to seem ghostly, prompts the audience to move through the tiny space which, in an origami-style feat, is made to contain long views into the past, a multitude of different characters and generations, and a host ofinteriors and outside views. A large central space is a typing-pool in which 1920s flappers use tea-chests as desks, and an Edwardian kitchen where a maid pummels something in an enamel bowl, while a workman peeks in through a skylight. Double doors open to show a courtship conducted on a bench, framed as by a proscenium arch; another romance is followed through a game of chess. Here's a piece which imitates the flicker of film and of memory. </p> <p>The artistic director of Southwark, Erica Whyman, is to move in the New Year to the Gate, treading in the footsteps of Stephen Daldry. The theatre is currently full of animation under the sorcerer's touch of Hayley Carmichael, who makes her directorial debut with an adaptation of a South American fairy tale. Anyone who has ever felt even faintly stirred by the idea of magic realism should see <strong> Shoot Me In The Heart</strong> . </p> <p>You don't go for the plot, which is tousled by whimsicality: you go to see a carnival. Its story - of a young woman who, never growing beyond the size of a small girl, is surrounded by harpy malice but rescued by romance - is a lava flow of red-hot images. </p> <p>Unexpected perspectives, both physical and emotional, are apparent from the opening moments. Naomi Wilkinson's beautiful design - a scarlet box made up of louvred doors - springs apart to display the heroine, radiantly played by Lisa Hammond, at a child's party surrounded by adults dressed as children. Parents mutter that their children's companion is not 'usual', but would be hard put to claim their own bulky offspring as being an appropriate size. Moments later the girl's mother stands in front of a book made out enormous red and white sheets, ripping out the pages on which are inscribed the tale of 'Thumbelina'. The mad dance induced by the bite of the tarantula is often mentioned: the play ends with lace curtains closing around the stage: they are striped with shadows like the huge jointed legs of a giant spider. </p> <p>The author of To the Green Fields Beyond , which I reviewed last week, was wrongly named as Nicholas Wright, instead of Nick Whitby.</p>",
  "<p>Richard Reed, 27, a graduate working in a 'regular advertising job', said goodbye to a salary of about \u00a335,000 because he wanted to 'do something different' and work with his two friends, Adam Balon and Jon Wright. </p> <p> 'It was something we'd always talked about. We loved our jobs, but we were at the stage in our careers when people wanted us to step up the ladder. We all thought: nobody's married, nobody's got children and nobody's got a mortgage. Now is the time to do it. </p> <p> 'We decided that a good product is anything that makes life a little bit easier and a bit better for people.' </p> <p> They dabbled with a system allowing baths to fill themselves to a designated temperature and depth, before deciding that the combination of electricity and water could not so much better people's lives as shorten them. </p> <p> 'We wanted to make it easy to do yourself some good without being health Nazis. Convenience food is usually unhealthy - but if the healthy option is there, people will buy it.' </p> <p> Following the idea of health in a bottle, they created 'smoothies' at home, using only fresh fruit. They then did a consumer test at a London music festival, asking the public to vote on whether they should give up their day jobs and produce the drinks professionally. </p> <p> The result was a resounding 'yes'. And so Innocent fresh fruit 'smoothies' were born, to be joined this year by their yogurt-blended alternatives, 'thickies'. Two years on, the boys have clearer complexions and are running their own show, but are their bank balances as healthy as their fruit juices? </p> <p> 'Friends, family, everyone was incredibly supportive. My old firm gave us an office to work from for free and they said that if it didn't work out I could go back.' </p> <p> Total innocents that they were, the boys made few provisions financially. 'We were very naive. We thought we could start making the juices in a month and then the money would start coming in. We thought we'd done the difficult bit - the recipes, labels and everything. We were totally wrong. It takes so much longer than you think.' </p> <p> The biggest hold-up was not accepting any compromise. 'Our product is all about 100 per cent fruit - no water, no sugar, no concentrated juices, no preservatives. We had to be singleminded and not let people water it down for us. They kept saying, you don't understand. So we'd say no, you don't understand. </p> <p> 'We had nine months of not earning a penny. We survived through huge debts (more than \u00a310,000 each), outstanding credit card bills (the highest was about \u00a310,000) and understanding girlfriends who were always buying the drinks and picking up the bills. Every meal was breakfast cereal or soup. It was pretty bleak.' </p> <p> And now? 'We're not working any harder but we feel a lot healthier. I have to drink about eight of these juices a day to make sure they pass quality control. Before, we were eating burgers, chips and lager because that was all that was available. Now we have burgers, chips, lager and fruit juices, which provide daily vitamins.' </p> <p> 'None of us has the salary we had, but we've only just started. I've paid off my credit card and can look at my bank account without fainting.' </p> <p> The future now looks even rosier for the boys, with 'veggies' joining Innocent's list of products, and possible forays into the beauty industry.</p>",
  "<p>I took early retirement last June and, as my annual season ticket ran to 5 December, I wanted a refund from Connex South Central. I was due for \u00a3979, which they said would be paid to my bank account, through my debit card, on 5 July. Despite innumerable phone calls, this still has not been paid. Other than taking the firm to court, what can I do?<strong><br>MC, Seaford </strong> </p> <p>This should have been a straightforward case to sort out. But no. First, Connex said its records showed you had been paid on 5 July. </p> <p>When it was proved that you had not, it claimed the delays were caused by Barclays Merchant Services which runs the electronic plastic-card business. Barclays countered that Connex was at fault for processing your refund on an inactive terminal. Barclays had disabled it because Connex had fewer transactions going through that one outlet than agreed in the contract. </p> <p>No, not our fault, said Connex: we went on using the terminal because Barclays failed to tell us it had shut it down. </p> <p>Well yes, we were a bit slow, admitted Barclays, and we had to go through Connex's intermediary company which added to the delay. Nine other refunds have also been held up. </p> <p>You should by now have \u00a3979 in your bank account but I feel you are entitled to compensation for the cost of the delay. </p> <p>Neither Barclays nor Connex agreed immediately, but said they would discuss it. Write to them both and ask. </p> <p><strong> Seeing double over TV cover</strong></p> <p>I bought a television set from Powerhouse on a 12-month 'buy now, pay later' deal that included extended warranty insurance for \u00a3244. Between signing and the payment date, I bought insurance for all my electrical equipment, so I contacted the store and the lender, GE Capital Bank, and was told I could cancel my original deal. I paid for the TV in June 1997 and visited the store to confirm what I had done. </p> <p>A year later, I noticed a direct debit of \u00a377 from my bank. GE Capital Bank took it for the insurance cover under a mandate signed two years earlier. It said that, because I had not paid the \u00a3244, I now owed \u00a3750, including interest on the sum I had already paid. I did not feel up to making a fight of it then but, after reading a similar case in Money Writes, I wonder if I could now.<br><strong> PH, Birmingham </strong> </p> <p>GE Capital initially refused to refund the money, saying your situation was not the same as the other reader's. The only difference I could see was that you had already paid up. </p> <p>When asked for an explanation, GE deliberated for several weeks before agreeing you had done all you could. It now has systems in place that alert staff when borrowers repay all but a small amount of an interest-free deal, and says it will not penalise you for being hit by the old procedure. It is refunding the insurance premium and interest you paid. </p> <p><strong> Please Minister, give us windfalls</strong><br> </p> <p>Thousands of NHS staff have subscribed to Equitable Life additional voluntary contributions for their pensions, but apparently the scheme is invested in a single account in the name of the Health Secretary. How can we protect our interests?<br><strong>AS, Wigan </strong></p> <p>Exactly what happens depends on Equitable Life's new owner, whoever that turns out to be, and whether the insurer demutualises. But you can be fairly relaxed. Civil Service employees were in the same situation when Lloyds TSB bought their AVC manager, Scottish Widows. There too the Secretary of State held the policy but the windfall was spread among the AVC holders. </p> <p>The NHS Pensions Agency says the principle of including members in any windfall 'would be respected where practicable'. Equitable Life says it too wants individual policyholders to receive the money. </p> <p>The National Association of Pension Funds points out that all Equitable Life's AVC holders face the same problem and it has already had meetings with the company to see they are treated fairly. </p> <p><strong> Who will handle my son's cash?</strong></p> <p>I am a single parent with a court order for maintenance payments for my 15- year-old son, arranged in 1991. I receive \u00a3129 a month, plus \u00a330 recently agreed voluntarily. I understood, when the Child Support Agency was established in 1993, that it would take over all agreements arranged through the courts. Is this still the plan?<br><strong>JS, Haddington</strong></p> <p>The original idea was that the courts would cease to have jurisdiction, and all applications to vary court orders would be made to the CSA, although this has not happened in practice. </p> <p>But under new legislation, from 2002 the CSA alone will have jurisdiction to determine child maintenance. It is believed that, for existing court orders, jurisdiction will remain with the courts for one year after the new law takes effect. Then it, too, will go to the CSA alone. </p> <p><strong> Leaving on a jet plane, \u00a3750 light</strong></p> <p>I took out Barclaycard travel insurance a couple of days before flying to Canada to visit my elderly father, but did not receive the policy document before I left.

I should have checked in at 10pm on 7 July for a flight at 1am, but I had it fixed in my mind that I was flying back on 8 July and missed the plane. </p> <p>When I realised my error, I called the emergency number and was advised to find the cheapest flight out. I paid \u00a3750, more than twice the cost of my original return ticket. Barclaycard has refused my claim, saying my policy does not cover these circumstances.

  "<p>If you need an income from your savings, you cannot afford to ignore corporate bond Isas. </p> <p>They invest, usually through a unit trust, in fixed- interest securities issued by companies which need to raise extra capital. Although yields on some funds have come down recently, it is still possible to find those offering 8 per cent or more and - thanks to the Isa wrapper - all this income is tax free. </p> <p>When income is important to you, it is natural that you should compare yields on different Isas to find out where you can get the best return. However, until recently, you could not be sure you were comparing like with like. There was no uniform formula for calculating yields. Some companies would quote the 'running yield', which simply reflected the level of income paid out, others a 'redemp tion yield' which took account of any charges against capital and potential capital loss if the bonds in the fund had been purchased above their redemption price. </p> <p>Since the beginning of September, new guidance from Autif, the investment funds' trade association, means that all fund managers must now give equal prominence in their advertising literature to the redemption yield. Jason Hollands, deputy managing director of independent financial advisers Best Investment, welcomes the move. He said: 'We have been calling for this change for some while. We always felt running yields were misleading and did not reflect the true return.' </p> <p>However, investors still have to be careful when making comparisons of corporate bond Isa yields because funds may be investing in different types of bonds. Those with the highest yields will be holding the highest risk bonds. </p> <p>Warren Perry, investment adviser at independent financial advisers Whitechurch Securities, explains: 'Yields on corporate bonds reflect the credit ratings of the companies that issue them. The greater the risk of default perceived by the market, the higher the yield the company must pay in compensation. </p> <p>'Big blue chip companies, on the other hand, can borrow money at lower interest rates because the risk of them not being able to pay back their debts is seen as very low.' </p> <p>This means that when you invest in a higher-yielding Isa you are taking a greater risk with your capital, but as Perry points out: 'In a corporate bond fund which will have between 80 and 100 holdings, if one company defaults it won't have a massive effect on your investment.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, even if there are no defaults, the capital values of the funds are likely to fluctuate more than those which invest in higher quality, lower-yielding bonds because, like shares, prices of high-yielding bonds will be affected by stock market sentiment. But this can also work to your advantage. </p> <p>Steven Price, technical manager at independent financial adviser Towry Law, says: 'It is always dangerous to sell bond funds on the basis of potential capital growth but there is no doubt that there is a greater likelihood of appreciation with a higher-yielding fund than a lower-yielding one.' </p> <p>One possible source of gain is when a company is taken over by another, more creditworthy company. This has the effect of increasing the value of its bonds. </p> <p>Perry believes different fund management skills are needed to run a high-yielding bond fund than a high-quality one. He says: 'You need a manager with experience and a good equity team behind him so he can avoid the companies most likely to default.' </p> <p>The two funds he recommends are Newton European High Yield and Scottish Widows High Income Bond fun. Both yield more than 9 per cent. </p> <p>He says: 'Helena Morrissey of Newton has an extremely good record running the company's other bond funds, and the group has a very strong European Equity team. </p> <p>'Similarly, the Scottish Widows fund which invests in American high-yielding bonds is managed in New York by bond experts at Mackay Shields and is already one of the best performers in its category.' </p> <p>Among other advisers, Jason Hollands, of Best Investment, also recommends the Newton European High Yield Fund, while Aberdeen Fixed Interest, managed by Paul Reed, gets Price's vote. </p> <p>Meanwhile Amanda Davidson, of financial adviser Holden Meehan, is a fan of Perpetual's Monthly Income Fund. She says: 'Not only does this fund invest in high-yielding bonds, it also has a small exposure to shares which automatically makes it more risky, but this should help to maintain its capital value in the longer run. Its performance so far has been very good.' However, Davidson points out: 'Many people seeking income only want to take the minimum riskwith their capital. For these investors we would recommend Legal &amp; General's Fixed Interest fund which invests only in the high-quality bonds.' </p> <p>Hollands agrees: 'Legal &amp; General's fund has the lowest management charges and with this type of fund where scope for differences in performance is limited, charges are the most important consideration.' </p> <p>Perry and Price, on the other hand, favour Perpetual's Corporate Bond fund for those who prefer a less risky choice.</p>",
  "<p>The American court ruling that valued a former Playboy playmate's marriage to a 90-year-old oil tycoon at $1 million a day is a clear example of the inextricable link between sex and money. </p> <p>Photographs of the happy couple during their 14 months of marriage would appear to indicate that the late James Howard Marshal was more than content with his side of the deal. And his wife, model Anna Nicole Smith, has consistently said she loved her geriatric husband. How much warmer her feelings towards him must be since she was awarded $449m from his estate last month, even though he inadvertently forgot to include her in his will. </p> <p>While the more puritanical and idealistic have probably already dismissed Anna Nicole as a gold-digger, albeit a beautiful one, many women may secretly have been wishing they, too, were in the position to attract a billionaire. Even a multi-millionaire would do! </p> <p>With the advent of the Lottery and dotcom firms, there are far more millionaires in Britain than ever before - about 2,500, according to the Inland Revenue. This covers only those permanently based in this country, not people just passing through. </p> <p>So, if women were to put their feminist scruples aside, how would they go about marrying one? As with all projects, it's a good idea to read around the subject first. Although British authors are a bit squeamish, American writers have been much more forthcoming. In How to Marry the Rich ($6.29, Berkley Publishing Group, available from <a href=\"http://www.barnesnoble.com\">www.barnesnoble.com</a>), former stockbroker Ginie Polo Sayles reveals how she snared a Texan oil baron. </p> <p>Tips include wearing natural fabrics (on the grounds that they are richer-looking), getting a job in the private jet lounge at an airport, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in affluent areas, having a tidy bathroom with just a box of facial tissues on the counter (so that's where I've been going wrong...), and reading obituaries to target rich widowers. Cleavage is also very important. </p> <p>You may be sceptical, but remember that Polo Sayles' tactics landed her a rich husband who has not yet learnt to say no to shopping sprees. </p> <p>Slightly more practical is Susan Wright's How to Marry Money - The Rich have to Marry Someone, Why not You?' ($8.05, also from <a href=\"http://www.barnesnoble.com\">www.barnesnoble.com</a>), which claims that a wealthy spouse is within the grasp of nearly anyone who knows how to go about it. She details where to go to meet a rich spouse, how to dress, how to find out about his finances, what the rich are really looking for, and - crucially - how to get around prenuptial agreements. </p> <p>But if you really want to understand how to capture the heart of a wealthy man, you are probably best off consulting one. Marry me - Three Professional Men Reveal how to get Mr Right to Pop the Question ($18.36 from <a href=\"http://www.barnesnoble.com\">www.barnesnoble.com</a>, although the book will be available in the UK from next spring) has been written by a married lawyer, an engaged doctor and a single accountant. </p> <p>They 'explain the weird alchemy that prevents men from committing, and tell readers how Mr Right can be persuaded to trot down the aisle'. Their advice is based on the belief that one of the most overlooked issues influencing a man's decision to commit is his career. Fit in with that and, apparently, you've cracked it. </p> <p>But if you feel you have no hope of nailing that millionaire - and let's face it, with just 2,500 to go around some of us are inevitably going to miss out - you'll just have to work on becoming a millionaire in your own right. </p> <p>Diane Harris, a financial expert on US website <a href=\"http://www.ka-ching.oxygen.com\">ka-ching</a> recommends saving 10 per cent of your salary and half of every pay rise, and putting as much of your long-term savings into shares as your nerves can stand. </p> <p>She reckons a 30-year-old woman earning $40,000 a year, who gets a 5 per cent pay rise every year and earns an average of 12 per cent on her savings (the average for the US stock market over the past 50 years), will have amassed $250,000 by the age of 45, $500,000 when she hits 50 and the magic $1m at around 55. To check when you will become a millionaire, visit the Ka-ching 'millionaire calculator'. There's no guarantee the news will be good, though - I won't be one until I'm over 100!</p> <p><strong>Wanted: A bride as rich as I am</strong></p> <p>You don't even have to leave the comfort of your home to find a suitable bride. </p> <p>Tobacco heir Patrick Reynolds has been advertising on the internet for a partner. It seems strange that a blue-eyed 51-year-old multi-millionaire living in the fashionable suburb of Brentwood, Los Angeles, has had to resort to blind dating via a website (www.love4two.com), but Reynolds claims that meeting the right woman is not easy.</p> <p>'I guess I got tired of finding myself in teeming bars, and knowing little or nothing about the women there,' he says. 'I decided it makes more sense to be introduced by someone who knows me - but very privately. So I thought I'd quietly approach friends and acquaintances who might be able to introduce me.'</p> <p>Reynolds set up his website - which includes a photo album (see above), a section on his work as head of a non-profit organisation campaigning against cigarette smoking, and personal details about himself and what he is looking for in a mate. Then he asked friends to pass on the details to women who matched his criteria. His ideal woman must be aged 28-34, no children but keen to have them, Caucasian, athletic or slender, 5'5\" or taller, some education and a non-smoker. But before you get too excited, the future Mrs Reynolds must also come from a wealthy family - the sticking point, no doubt, for many thousands of hopefuls who have visited his site.</p> <p>Reynolds explains: 'I feel it's important that we have this common ground, this shared experience. There's a whole set of problems that goes with being from a wealthy family, and I'd like someone who shares in and fully understands that.' Ahhhhhh.</p>",
  "<p>If you have ever felt that you would like to murder a solicitor, you are not alone. Half of the people who say they had problems in house buying or selling say the cause was due to 'delays by solicitors', according to research conducted by law firm HammondsDirect. </p> <p>But help is at hand. Hammonds recently launched an e-conveyancing service which, it says, will deliver a much quicker and more efficient service. </p> <p>The firm, which has been involved in e-conveyancing for the Halifax and other lenders for nearly three years, estimates that it cuts the length of the process from 12 to eight weeks. </p> <p>Other firms are likely to follow suit. The Society for Licensed Conveyancers has agreed to provide e-conveyancing for the homebuying site <a href=\"http://www.easier.com\">www.easier.com</a>. </p> <p>E-loan, the online mortgage quotation and arrangement site, also wants to set up an e-conveyancing capability. 'In theory, searches could be done instantly,' says product development director Frank Eve. 'Buying a house is very stressful - but it becomes less stressful if you know what is happening. Under the current system, what tends to happen is that people ring their solicitors to find out, but have difficulty getting a reply. Solicitors tend to be busy people. And if you don't know what is happening on the transaction, you tend to fill the vacuum with negative thoughts.' </p> <p>On the Hammonds Direct site, legalmove.com, clients can access their case file 24 hours a day on a secure part of the site. They can read all the relevant documents as they are created or as they arrive - the contract agreement, the leasehold or the fixtures and fittings list, for example. They can also see whether the searches have been applied for and what responses were received. </p> <p>Hammonds Direct has not, however, set out to be the cheapest player in the business. Its fees for most properties will be between \u00a3299 and \u00a3499, depending on the purchase price. </p> <p>Lucci Dammone, who has masterminded legalmove.com, says the emphasis is more on providing an efficient, transparent service than on shaving the fees to the minimum. 'The conveyancing service is ideally suited to using the internet,' he says. </p> <p>If local authorities also went online, searches could be done in a matter of seconds, rather than the fortnight that it often takes now. But progress of this order will take a few years yet: only a quarter of local authorities are thought to have converted to an electronic system. </p> <p>And solicitors have been slow to embrace the new world of the web in this field. Many are worried that they could lose some of their profit margin if they switch from a labour-intensive service to one that makes more use of computers. But now that the first firms have started offering their services, however, other firms are more likely to feel the heat of competition. </p> <p>The service being developed by the Society for Licensed Conveyancers will also focus on service delivery rather than marketing itself on price. About 24 firms are planning to take part in the scheme. Each will be able to set its own charges. 'The web brings about a very high degree of transparency,' says society chief executive Nigel Ewert Evans. </p> <p>Conveyancing charges now average \u00a3397 on an \u00a380,000 sale, according to the Woolwich, and \u00a3415 on an \u00a380,000 purchase. Fees are only slightly lower on a \u00a360,000 transaction - \u00a3372 and \u00a3390 respectively.</p>",

For her students, getting to grips with all the exceptions that make up our mother tongue cannot be easy. For Lynne, it is pensions and investments that cause a headache. </p> <p>She is worried about the personal pension she took out with insurer Gan when she opted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) in 1992. Gan was taken over by Windsor Life and recent bad press about the company's investment performance has made Lynne unhappy. </p> <p>'I wrote to the company expressing my concerns and got a letter back which admitted to the underperformance of some funds but assured me things would be OK in the long run,' says an unconvinced Lynne. 'I don't feel confident in the firm,' she says. </p> <p>Yet she finds herself in a dilemma because she feels she would lose out if she tried to transfer her pension fund elsewhere. </p> <p>Lynne would like to increase her contributions but does not want to do so if she is not going to get a good deal. She now puts aside just under \u00a370 a month, although she has saved more in the past. Her last statement from Windsor Life put the value of her voluntary contributions to her Personal Wealth Plan at \u00a316,448 and her Serps con tribution rebates at \u00a36,373. The plan's transfer value - the amount she would get if she switched - was only \u00a317,023. </p> <p>Her employer does not provide a scheme, although the school employs seven full-time staff and six or seven more working casually. Lynne knows 'stakeholder pensions are a possibility' but the school principal has not yet told staff his intentions about the new Government-backed scheme, which starts next April. </p> <p>She has recently been saving \u00a350 a month in an Egg account, and could afford to put aside around \u00a320 a month more. </p> <p>Is there anything better she could be doing with this money, she asks. So far she has \u00a33,000 in the Egg account and would like a better return. She has been considering switching to another high interest bank or building society account. </p> <p>Her mortgage concerns her too. Like many borrowers who feared a return to higher interest rates a few years ago, in 1997 she took out a five-year fixed-rate loan at 7.89 per cent. Ordinary mortgage rates declined, and she is still paying more than the current variable rate of 7.74 per cent charged by most large lenders. </p> <p>She has thought about remortgaging, but her bank, NatWest, said early redemption would cost her more than \u00a3900 in penalties, which appears to cancel out any advantage.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Amanda Davidson </strong></p> <p>Lynne has an old-style pension that locks you in and penalises you heavily for moving. There is unlikely to be anything that she can do about this.</p> <p>She is right that stakeholder pensions will be with us in about six months' time. Her firm will have to provide one of these pensions as there are more than five staff. It could be advantageous for Lynne to participate, particularly if her employer decides to contribute. She should keep up with any plans it may have before deciding what to do.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she could put the money into an individual savings account (Isa). This, while not giving her tax relief on contributions as a pension would, would enable her to benefit in future from a tax-free fund, from which she could draw a tax-free income. This has become a good alternative to pensions for basic-rate taxpayers such because annuity rates are so low.</p> <p>The savings in the Egg account could be transferred into a mini-cash Isa. Up to \u00a33,000 can be placed in these without any tax on the interest.</p> <p>Lynne could ask her lender, to waive the penalties, giving her a fresh deal. If that only locked her further into her current scheme or she fails to improve it, she should wait until 2002 and renegotiate.</p> <p>Finally, she should make sure that if she or her husband fell ill they could repay their mortgage. They need either health or critical-illness insurance. </p> <p>Amanda Davidson works for financial adviser Holden Meehan.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Steven Price</strong></p> <p>The \u00a33,000 Lynne has saved for emergencies should go into a tax-free mini- cash Isa. </p> <p>Remortgaging would bring exit and entry costs if a further fixed-rate loan was taken out. Lynne already puts the fees for leaving her current loan at more than \u00a3900. Arranging another five-year fixed loan would cost between \u00a3350 and \u00a3600, though this could be added to the new loan.</p> <p>There are some very competitive deals available, and she could benefit from remortgaging in the short to medium term.

  "<p>Income drawdown gets round today's problem of low annuity rates. It is suitable for people with pension funds above \u00a3250,000 who do not need to squeeze the maximum income from this money and can afford the risk that their income might reduce. </p> <p>On retirement, you can take the tax-free cash sum from your pension fund and then draw an income from the balance, which would otherwise buy the annuity. As well as avoiding low annuity rates, you may choose income drawdown because: </p> <p>a) Your pension fund continues to grow, so you have more with which to buy an annuity eventually; </p> <p>b) You want to decide how your money is invested; </p> <p>c) The older you are when you buy an annuity, the better rate you get; </p> <p>d) You do not need all the income an annuity provides; </p> <p>e) You want your beneficiaries to inherit your fund.(Once you buy an annuity, the insurer keeps your capital.) </p> <p>You can continue income drawdown until you are 75, when you must buy an annuity by law. The only reasons to buy an annuity sooner are if your health changes; you can no longer afford investment risk; you need more income; or annuity rates have risen so high they are worth buying (which is not happening). Re-evaluate every year. </p> <p>If you contract an illness that shortens your life expectancy, you can buy an impaired life annuity, which pays more from the outset, making them better value. </p> <p>Once started, stay with income drawdown as long as possible, so your investments have time to grow to counterbalance the outgoings. The Government restricts how much you can take under income drawdown, and this is less than annuities pay. Ensure you are not withdrawing so much that it eats into your capital, otherwise you will end up with less for the eventual annuity. </p> <p>Peter Quinton, managing director of The Annuity Bureau, advises: 'What is regarded as a conservative amount varies according to your age. Around 6 per cent is a sensible level.'</p> <p> \u0095 Income Drawdown Advisory Bureau: 020 7401 2040</p>",
  "<p>The cost of putting a roof over your head in London is daunting, but there are a few ways to reduce the burden.</p> <p><strong>Move to a cheaper part of town</strong></p> <p> Although properties are much more expensive in London than anywhere else in the country, there is a wide variation in prices throughout the capital. Generally, the further from the centre you live the more you will get for your money. While \u00a3150,000 might buy you a dog kennel in Chelsea or South Kensington (if you are lucky), the same amount could buy you a two-bedroom house in Tooting. If you have to live in an expensive area because of work, ask local estate agents if there are pockets of housing that represent better value for money compared to their fashionable neighbours. Cash-strapped buyers usually look in the area immediately next to the one that they really want to live in, but can't afford. </p> <p>However, Yolande Barnes, head of research at agent FPD Savills, says that in a housing market that is on the turn (as London seems to be), this can be a dangerous ploy. She warns that property prices in the 'poor man's alternative' areas are much more volatile than those in consistently popular areas, and that people buying at the top of the market could soon find themselves sitting on a loss. </p> <p>However, if you are buying on a budget, you will have little choice. Instead of looking in: </p> <p>\u0095 Islington, former home of the Blairs, consider Stoke Newington, where \u00a3150,000 will buy you a two-bedroom flat in a mansion block; </p> <p>\u0095 Chiswick consider Brentford where \u00a3155,000 will buy you a two-bedroom house; </p> <p>\u0095 Clapham consider Tooting or Streatham, where \u00a3138,000 buys you a two-bedroom house; </p> <p>\u0095 Fulham, consider Putney, where \u00a3149,950 will buy you a three-bedroom split-level maisonette; </p> <p>\u0095 Blackheath, consider Catford, where \u00a3158,000 will buy a three-bedroom terraced house on the Corbett Estate. </p> <p><strong> Take in a lodger</strong></p> <p> Take advantage of the fact that some people cannot afford to buy in London by renting out a room in your house. Under the Rent-a-Room scheme, you can take in a lodger and charge up to \u00a34,250 during the current tax year (or \u00a381 a week) without paying any income tax (any rent over this amount will be liable for tax at your highest rate). You cannot, however, claim any expenses or capital allowances.

But if they remortgaged to a Coventry Building Society mortgage discounted by 2.46 per cent (to a rate of 5.24 per cent) until 31 December 2002 (with free legal fees and valuation but an arrangement fee of \u00a3195), they would pay just \u00a3908 a month - a saving of \u00a3237.</p> <p>Likewise there is little benefit to be gained in staying with the same house and contents insurer. Ask an insurance broker such as People's Choice (0800 112233) to check out quotes on your behalf, and shop around some of the direct insurers yourself, such as Churchill (0800200345) or Eagle Star (0800 868686). </p> <p><strong> Do holiday swaps </strong></p> <p> Just because you find London a strain, it doesn't stop other people wanting to visit for a holiday.

The new town is the most popular destination in the UK for people moving home, according to the Regional Trends survey. Its population grew by 60 per cent between 1981 and 1998. </p> <p>Liz Clarke, a 29-year old project administrator, has experienced both places. 'I was born and grew up in Milton Keynes, moved to London when I was 19, and came back to Milton Keynes after travelling. I found it really dull as a teenager, but the town has changed out of all recognition since then,' she says.</p> <p>The town used to lack an infrastructure, she says, with no real high street and no community feel. But now Milton Keynes has developed a thriving shopping centre over the years, with a John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, Top Shop, Hennes and a recently opened Debenhams. A piazza has built up around the town's theatre, encour aging a cafe-society feel to evenings out.</p> <p>And although Milton Keynes is just 35 minutes from London by train, with Oxford and Cambridge just 35 miles away in opposite directions, property prices are relatively low. You can buy a two-bedroom flat for \u00a350,000 and a four-bedroom house with double garage for \u00a3140,000. But a disadvantage is that you really need a car to get around from one section of town to another.</p> <p>Nor is there any shortage in employment, with companies such as Abbey National, Minolta, Mercedes, IBM and BT having bases there. 'I've never been out of work for more than three days,' says Liz.</p> <p>But although there are attractive villages in the vicinity such as Newport Pagnell and Stoney Stratford, she admits the town itself still lacks character.</p> <p>Now she is on the move again. Last week Liz swapped a one-bedroom flat in Newport Pagnell, which she had been renting for \u00a3385 a month, for a smaller one-bedroom flat off Clapham Common in South London for \u00a3800 a month. She hopes the move will enable her to move into media-related work and add spice to her leisure time. 'Milton Keynes is fantastic for families. It's got everything you need then. Maybe in 10 years I'll settle down here.'</p>",
  "<p>It really is grim down south. New research confirms what many southerners have suspected - living standards are higher in the North of England. Yes, people in the South East do earn more, but their living standards are among the lowest in the country because they pay far more for food, transport and housing, according to the Regional Trends report published by the Office of National Statistics. </p> <p>Someone working in Middlesbrough earned an average of \u00a317,490 last year, and people in Greater Manchester were paid an average \u00a319,438, while Londoners generally were paid\u00a328,812 and those working in the City itself received a whopping \u00a343,288. </p> <p>But the cost of buying a home, travelling to work and groceries are also much higher in the South. While the weekly food and drink bill for one person comes to \u00a315.57 in the North East, it is\u00a317.99 in London and \u00a318.88 in the South East. And while the weekly national average household expenditure is \u00a3332.60 and only \u00a3282.90 in the North East, the bill increases to \u00a3376 in London and the South East. </p> <p>However, the biggest problem for anyone trying to buy a home or raise a family in London and the surrounding commuter belt is property prices. Lawrence Davies, a solicitor who works at North Lambeth Law Centre in south London, is paid \u00a323,000 a year. His salary is above the national average of \u00a320,919, but below the average for London, and he has found it impossible to buy a family-sized home for himself and his wife within reasonable travelling distance of work. The couple, who have been married for just over a year, are thinking of starting a family in two or three years, and will need somewhere larger than their one-bedroom flat in Kingston. </p> <p>But Davies says: 'Anything with two or more bedrooms is going to cost more than \u00a3100,000. My wife is planning to return to college and, whatever income multiples you use, my salary just won't cover a \u00a3100,000-plus mortgage.' </p> <p>The couple are contemplating a move to Oxfordshire, which would mean a long and tiring journeys to and from work for him. </p> <p>One of his law centre colleagues is quitting the Law Centre to move to Leeds. 'He can't secure a rental property in London because the market is so competitive, and he can't afford to buy,' says Davies. </p> <p>The Halifax House Price Index shows the the scale of the problem. Although prices fell in London by 2.4 per cent during the second quarter of this year, the cost of the average London property is still \u00a3145,104 - nearly three times higher than in the North (\u00a356,228) or in Yorkshire and Humberside (\u00a355,494). Semi-detached houses in Greater London fetched an average of \u00a3210,100, nearly four times more than the cost of an equivalent home in Northumberland (\u00a356,250) and nearly five times more than in South Humberside (\u00a344,800). </p> <p>If struggling to meet the monthly mortgage payment doesn't make your life purgatory, commuting to work will. Transport costs are much higher in London and the South East. While a monthly Metro pass to all areas of Newcastle costs \u00a339.25, and a monthly bus and train pass in Manchester costs \u00a368.50, a monthly pass for all zones in on London Transport will set you back a huge \u00a3136.00. True, Londoners have shorter journeys to work, but they spend much longer commuting - an average of 32 minutes compared with only 18 minutes for commuters elsewhere in the country. </p> <p>These findings are, to some extent, con tradicted by the Indices of Deprivation 2000, published by the Department of the Environment. This report, which came out in August, shows that nine of the 10 most deprived areas in England are in the North. That data, covering most accepted measures of the quality of life, including job opportunities, health, housing, education and access to basic services such as post offices and shops, shows that northern towns and cities such as Middlesbrough and Liverpool suffer the worst social conditions. The only exception is Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. The 10 least deprived areas are in the South and Midlands, according to this study, which doesn't take living costs into account. </p> <p>But Londoners don't believe any of it, and are voting with their feet. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation finds that 48,000 more people leave London each year than move to the capital from other parts of the country. </p> <p>And contrary to popular belief, the pressure on housing in the South East has not been caused by northerners migrating south. The real culprit is an exodus of Londoners pushing up prices in the surrounding areas as they swap life in the capital for those longer commuter journeys and higher travelling costs. </p> <p><strong>Rich and poor </strong></p> <p><strong>Most deprived areas</strong></p> <p>1.

  "<p>The man from the Intelligence Bureau wanted to know exactly what I was up to in Multan. He had spotted me walking through the bazaar with my host, Moin, and had been so alarmed at the spectacle that he had rung Moin at his family home at eight the next morning. Moin, the director of a local non-governmental organisation, is no friend of the military dictatorship, and is accustomed to low-level harassment from the authorities. I heard him assure the secret policeman that I was merely a 'writer of cricket stories' and that my visit had nothing to do with politics. This wasn't strictly true but I was happy to bow to Moin's preference for discretion over valour.</p> <p>'That man is very happy now,' Moin informed me. 'Cricket is the best passport you can have in Pakistan.' </p> <p>Multan in the southern Punjab is renowned for heat, flies and beggars, but in the early spring it's a balmy place, with a dilapidated medieval centre speckled with blue-glazed Sufi shrines. That day I drove south through a landscape of shady canals, green fields and mango orchards. In nearby Bahawalpur I visited the Dring Stadium, the country's oldest international cricket ground, where Hanif Mohammed scored the first Test century on Pakistani soil in 1954.</p> <p>Little of note has taken place there since. The one-day international circus rarely alights at the Dring which, like southern Punjab as a whole, seems a victim of discrimination and neglect. Nonetheless, it remains an attractive ground with a 1930s pavilion. While the malis weeded the outfield, the surrounding gardens and alleyways were packed with boys playing cricket. Barefoot fast bowlers with whippy actions hurled battered composite balls at batsmen who played shots all around the wicket. There's no academy in Pakistan, no development system, but young prodigies keep bubbling up from below. </p> <p>In Bahawalpur, as elsewhere in Pakistan, I was interrogated with polite determination. What was my opinion of the Pakistani cricket team? Since it was obvious that Pakistan had the world's most talented cricketers, why did the team lose so often? Why did they keep changing the captain? Who could explain the selection policies? In sum, what was wrong with Pakistani cricket? As elsewhere, they didn't need me to tell them the answers. They muttered about corruption, mismanagement, favouritism, factionalism. Their contempt for the rulers of Pakistani cricket was as fierce as their pride in the brilliance of Pakistani cricketers. I asked them who would win tomorrow's one day international against Sri Lanka.</p> <p>'Pakistan, of course,' said a studious-looking wicketkeeper in glasses and baseball cap, then added, 'unless...' and rubbed his fingers together in the universal sign for the bottom line.</p> <p>The next day I made my way into the Cholistan desert. In a remote village there was an annual mela, an immemorial gathering of the clans around the sand dune shrine of a folk saint. Transvestites dance and smile. Nomadic families are camped out with their animals, cooking and chatting in the sun. Singers and drummers keep up an endless rhythmic drone. A group of boys squatting next to a herd of young camels listen to a small radio broadcasting the ball by ball from Karachi. I approach and ask the score. Pakistan are batting well. They are making a big score. But then, a wicket falls. There's a burst of excited static from the radio. The boys fiddle with the tuner. They shake their heads. One looks at me with a grim smile and rubs his fingers together.</p> <p>To grasp the impact of the cascade of match-fixing rumours and revelations in Pakistan and India, you first have to grasp the importance of cricket within south Asian culture. Imagine the British interest in football, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf, snooker and athletics all rolled into one, then add in pop music and television soaps, and you begin to get the scale. Sachin Tendulkar has been repeatedly named not only as the most widely recognised living Indian, but also the most respected. In England, it's a rare occurrence for an event in the cricket world to hit the front-pages. In India and Pakistan, it's routine. India has the second largest population in the world, and Pakistan the sixth, but they barely featured in the medal winners' table in Sydney. For societies eager for a hike in global status, cricket is a rare and welcome balm, a compensation as well as a distraction. In this field alone they have produced world-beaters, so when the world-beaters' probity and patriotism comes into question, emotions run high. </p> <p>'The automatic equation between brilliant-cricketer-therefore-brilliant-human-being is a difficult one to break,' says Sharda Ugra, sports editor at India Today, the country's biggest English language weekly. On her way back from reporting on the King Commission inquiry into the Hanise Cronje scandal in South Africa (the magazine's cover story), she found herself trying to explain to incredulous cricket lovers some painful realities about one of India's greatest sporting heroes, the all-rounder (and until recently, national coach) Kapil Dev. 'It took me the better part of three hours to convince two people sitting next to me in the plane that Kapil might be involved in the scandals. When I told him about all the times that Kapil had refused to do interviews if he wasn't paid, this middle-aged businessman could only say, \"But he is my hero!\"</p> <p>'The die hard fans are still struggling with the fact that their heroes could be guilty of doing what Cronje did,' says Ugra. 'But the newer followers, that section of the population that had switched during the past 10 years from being totally uninterested in cricket to being riveted by the television spectacle, a lot of them female, retired people, are now disgusted and put off. It is this lot who have made what I call the \"reality-switch\" very quickly.' </p> <p>Perhaps the saddest feature of the whole affair is that so few people in India believe anything will come of it. After all, scandals of much greater import to Indian society - and involving greater sums of money and equally famous names - have come and gone with the culprits still at large. No one ever faced trial in either the Bofors or Hawala scams, which were considered political earthquakes in their day. The rich and well-connected, it seems, will always escape justice. While the Indian criminal justice system grinds slowly, sponsors and advertisers have been quicker to pass judgment. Suddenly the ubiquitous adverts featuring famous cricketers plugging everything from air conditioners to men's suits have vanished from the screen. A recent television advert gives some idea of the prevailing mood. It shows four people sitting around watching cricket on the box. The screen flickers and the picture is distorted. One of the viewers gets up and says the cable must have shifted.</p> <p>'Match fix kar doon?' ('shall I fix the match?'), he asks. His friend answers that there's no need; the problem can be 'fixed' from a seated position - and then extols the television's new remote control features.</p> <p>There's a wary cynicism in the popular response to the match-fixing scandal, but it doesn't seem to have reduced the popular appetite for cricket. Vendors of cricket equipment insist the scandal has had no impact on sales and the demand for places in cricket clubs and coaching clinics is as insatiable as ever. Since the ICC Knock-Out Trophy currently under way in Kenya will be the first international cricket played by India since the scandal broke in April, it remains to be seen whether television audiences have kept faith with the game. </p> <p>People in India can't seem to make up their minds whether Manoj Prabhakar is a hero or villain in the match-fixing melodrama. The former Indian all-rounder was always known as a member of the awkward squad, and had already made his share of enemies long before he began muttering about bookies and bribes in 1997. His allegations were investigated by the Chandrachud Commission and dismissed as unfounded.</p> <p>Earlier this year, following Cronje's confession, Prabhakar equipped himself with a hidden camera and videotaped a number of private conversations with players and administrators. The explosive results were aired on Indian television in May. One after another, cricketers, broadcasters, coaches and cricket board members confirm Prabhakar's allegations. One after another, they concede that match-fixing is 'going on all the time' but that 'there is nothing you can do about it'.</p> <p>'Prabhakar's videotapes have had a huge impact on the non-believers,' Ugra observes. 'A lot of us knew there was antagonism and backbiting and insecurity within cricket, like there is in any sport, but there were plenty who gave cricketers the benefit of the doubt. I think no one could predict the extent of the rot.'</p> <p>One of the documentary's saddest, most revealing moments occurs in a conversation between Prabhakar and Navjot Singh Sidhu, the former Indian opening batsman, a gritty crease-occupier and, like Prabhakar, renowned as a difficult customer. On the tape, Sidhu makes it clear that while he does not dispute Prabhakar's allegations, he must turn down his old friend's pleas to back him in public. 'I know you very well, but first listen to me. Even if you go to someone else, he will not go along with you. Nobody. After all, Kapil Dev is not an ordinary person. He is a respected man in this country. Highly respected. If you lift a finger against a respected man and you don't have proof, it's like inviting trouble. Secondly, I'm indebted to Kapil Paaji. He gave me an opportunity to play no matter what kind of person he is. I owe him a debt. I don't want to be dragged into this. I don't get involved in any matter, leave alone a matter of this importance. They (journalists) call me everyday. I don't even say,\"'No comments\".'</p> <p>Sidhu's paranoia, like Prabhakar's whiny desperation, tell us a great deal about big-time Indian cricket. This is a climate in which patronage and personal favour count, in which success on the field is never enough. It is not a climate in which whistle-blowers flourish.</p> <p>As a result of the Prabhakar tapes and King Commission testimony, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepped up its probe and in mid-July the Income Tax department launched high-profile raids on cricketers and cricket board personnel. With a characteristically south Asian nostalgia for the game's lost innocence, tax officials dubbed the raids 'Operation Gentleman'.</p> <p>From Kapil Dev to the former chairman of the International Cricket Council, Jagmohan Dalmiya, few were spared. Although the information gathered is still under review and no charges have been brought, newspapers have printed lurid accounts of the eye-popping wealth uncovered in the course of the raids. If nothing else, the press leaks have re-inforced the popular conviction that corruption in the game is widespread. 'I am delighted that these raids took place,' said Khushwant Singh, one of the country's best-known columnists. 'Personally, I am relieved. I have stopped watching cricket altogether.'</p> <p>Whatever they may add by way of circumstantial evidence in the match-fixing cases, in themselves the raids merely confirm that international cricketers are no different from other rich Indians. The hoarding of undeclared assets is standard practise among the country's *lite. For that *lite, there is now a growing danger that the match-fixing scandal will overspill its boundaries. Jaya Jaitly, the president of the Samata party, a partner in the governing coalition, held a press conference in Delhi to denounce the 'high-handed' raid on the homes and offices of Ajay Jadeja, the middle-class heart throb with the princely pedigree who has been repeatedly named in connection with the scandals. Jaitly's daughter works for Jadeja and is said to be engaged to marry him. The politician took particular umbrage over the 'personal' questioning of her daughter ('by my own government') and accused the tax officials of asking for 50,000 rupees (\u00a3750) to hush up the case. 'They asked for food and demanded rotis made at home, not bazaar stuff.'</p> <p>In the wake of the tax raids, both Muhammad Azharuddin and Kapil Dev were interrogated by the CBI. They were also named frequently in Prabhakar's tapes. Imagine Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker in the dock, and you'll get a small idea of how the heavens have fallen in the sub-continent. </p> <p>I first laid eyes on Muhammad Azharuddin at Eden Gardens in January 1985, when the then 21-year-old neophyte compiled a measured Test century against England. The crowd that day - full to its 100,000 capacity, patient, knowledgeable, appreciative - seems to belong to a different world to the crowds that surge into the grounds for today's one-day internationals - feverishly partisan, quickly bored, and mostly indifferent to anything other than national victory. </p> <p>And apart from the still flexible wrists, the world-weary, besieged celebrity who turned out for Asia against the Rest of the World at the Oval this summer seems a very different person from the modest, tongue-tied, unworldly lad who put the English bowlers to the sword at Eden Gardens. In those days, he shared a home in a low-income housing colony in Hyderabad with 17 other family members. Today, according to the reports leaked from the income tax raids, he is the owner of seven luxury properties in Bombay, six imported vehicles, 20 designer wristwatches and several closets worth of Armani and Versace togs. </p> <p>At the Oval, every time Azhar touched the ball, the crowd let fly. 'Account number kya hai?' (What is your account number?). When he fluffed a catch in the slips, it was 'Payment late?'. The umpires were urged to 'check his pockets!'. Compared to what is likely to greet him in India, if he ever plays cricket there again, it was mild.</p> <p>Azhar was named by Cronje to the King Commission as his initial link man with the bookies, nd on the Prabhakar tape Ravi Shastri, the former Indian all-rounder turned TV commentator, describes him as 'the asshole' who 'must be shifted'. Panicked by the rising tide of accusation, Azhar did something he had resisted in the past; he played the minority card, claiming that he was being singled out for attack because he was a Muslim.</p> <p>Azhar captained India through much of the 1990s, a period that coincided with the rising influence of a right-wing Hindu nationalism pumping out an ugly anti-Muslim message. Like other Muslims prominent in the entertainment world, he went out of his way to assert his patriotic credentials and in particular his desire to defeat Pakistan on the field of play. Hindu bigots heaped praise on him for showing the country what a 'loyal Muslim' should be. However, he was already being criticised by conservatives - both Muslim and Hindu - for his divorce and subsequent marriage to Sangeeta Bijlani, a Bombay model. On the outside, Azhar remained a diffident figure. But those who know him insist he changed. The globe-trotting, the lavish lifestyle, the adoring crowds, the easy money are all blamed for ruining the one time innocent.</p> <p>Azhar also suffers from a subliminal association with the 'Muslim underground', the criminal empire said to be run by Dawood Ibrahim from his safe haven in the Gulf. There is little that goes wrong in India that some people are not prepared to lay at Dawood's doorstep; his alleged links with just about every powerful figure in Indian life - from politics to cinema to sport - keep conspiracy theorists working overtime. As the Prabhakar tapes confirmed, Dawood is a real presence in cricket, and has appeared in both the Indian and Pakistani dressing rooms. But if there is a specific link between Azhar and Dawood - as former Indian captain Ravi Shastri alleges in the Prabhakar tapes - it has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with money.</p> <p>Azhar is a creature of the culture of individual acquisitiveness that swept through the upper echelons of Indian society in the 1990s. In business, politics and culture, it was the decade of hype and hustle, a scramble for scarce privileges in a poverty-blighted society. A packaged patriotism was married to a deregulated business environment, and Azhar was only one of many pulled into the resultant maelstrom. </p> <p>As rumour followed rumour, Kapil Dev found his hitherto unchallenged public standing hopelessly compromised. Journalists began publishing some of the things they had already known for a long time, particularly about Kapil's business affairs. The Gujerat state government announced that it was ordering the removal from school text books of a chapter celebrating the great all-rounder. In early September, Kapil was interrogated by the CBI, and pressure built up for him to resign as coach of the Indian team. This was a delicate matter for the cricket board. How do you rid yourself discreetly of a tainted national hero? Everyone wanted Kapil to go, but no one wanted to be seen to push him out. So the board reportedly floated rumours that it might be looking for a replacement, then publicly denied the rumours and invited Kapil to remain in charge. </p> <p>Besieged by the media, Kapil submitted his resignation, which was then accepted by the board with a show of regret. Privately, it had been made clear to Kapil that if he delayed any longer, he would have to be sacked. Sharda Ugra described the episode as 'a classic example of Indian cricket's theatre of the absurd' dictated by 'a tragi-comic compromise formula.' The legendary slow bowler and long-time loose cannon Bishen Bedi dismissed Kapil's exit as 'stage managed.' Indian captain Saurav Ganguly was surprisingly terse: 'Frankly, it doesn't matter who the coach is.' </p> <p>The board was said to be divided over how to handle Kapil's disgrace. Having excluded all those players named in the match-fixing imbroglio from the squad for the ICC Trophy (which meant no places for Azhar or Jadeja), it seemed strange that the axe should not also fall on the national coach. But then, the axe had also spared two other individuals involved in the tax raids - the powerful Dalmiya and the board treasurer Kishore Rungta. 'What happens to the board officers will indicate the intent and extent of Indian cricket's clean-up,' commented a still sceptical Ugra.</p> <p>As for Kapil, the once vivacious and uncomplicated competitor has slunk away from the public eye, wounded and bewildered. 'I cannot explain anything,' he told a journalist. 'You are free to write what you wish. I have nothing to say. Let me be. Please.'</p> <p>Shortly after Pakistan's elected government was ousted by a military dictatorship last year, Lt General Tauqir Zia was installed as head of the cricket board, assisted by a phalanx of army and air force personnel. For the current military rulers, cricket serves much the same purposes as it served their predecessors, generals Zia Ul Haq and Ayub Khan: an instrument for legitimising the regime and for distracting the masses. It is also, now, a means for the military to demonstrate its main justification in the eyes of the people - its claim that it will root out the corruption that bedevilled the civilian system. So far there's little evidence of improvement, in cricket or elsewhere. </p> <p>It was in Pakistan that the match-fixing scandal began in 1994, when Salim Malik was accused of attempted bribery by Shane Warne and Mark Waugh (who, it later emerged, had themselves accepted payment from bookies). Nearly six years later, after three inquiries supervised by the cream of the Pakistani judiciary, the result is that former captain Salim Malik and medium-pacer Ata-ur-Rehman have been banned for life (their international careers were finished in any case). Six others, including Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, have been fined amounts between $2,000 and $6,000. The fines will be deducted from their match fees. </p> <p>Judging by the published reports, the case against Akram seemed much weightier than the one made out against Ata-ur-Rehman. Akram remains, however, a key member of the side. Colonel (Retd) Rafi Nasim, a former head of the cricket board and now a columnist for a daily newspaper, declared that the fines 'will act as a last nail in the coffin of match fixing as far as Pakistan is concerned. Of all the countries allegedly involved in this evil practice Pakistan was the most prompt as well as logical in dealing with this issue.' Not everyone agrees. A citizen has lodged a petition in the Sindh High Court calling for all the players named in the final report to be banned from the game and prosecuted for criminal offences. </p> <p>Turning from tragedy to farce, Pakistani cricket has recently been rocked by one of its rare sex scandals. Or at least that' s how the local press have reported it. Three promising international cricketers were found in the company of of a number of young women in the team's Karachi hotel rooms on the eve of their flight to a tournament in Singapore. The players insisted that the women were fans who had barged their way in, and the manager says his investigation confirms their story. Nonetheless, they have each been fined \u00a3800 and banned from the ICC tournament in Kenya. Lt General Zia explained: 'I had to strike a balance as PCB chairman and that I did without destroying the careers of the players. I have penalised the players for their indiscretion although there was no evidence against them.' </p> <p>So although the alleged perpetrators of this poor excuse for a sex scandal were declared innocent, they were still fined some two thirds of the amount that was levied on players acused, and found guilty, of match-fixing. The popular all-rounder Shahid Afridi, one of the three players who may or may not have committed a minor misdemeanour in the Karachi hotel, bewailed his predicament. 'My father, mother and brothers have been very critical of my actions. They have been reprimanding me. None of them are ready to believe me. I am at a loss as to what my action should be. </p> <p>Those who raised this false allegation have managed to establish it as a truth. However, I can swear by God to prove my innocence.' Unfortunately for Afridi, many Pakistani (and Indian) cricketers have made similar declarations in recent years, and too often they have proved hollow....</p> <p>Today, in India and Pakistan, people follow the unfolding match-fixing scandals, and see in cricket a vivid picture of a malaise that blights both their societies: the lawlessness of the rich, the unaccountability of the powerful, the cynical manipulation of public institutions and popular spectacles for private gain. But that is not all they see in cricket. </p> <p>If the England players make the most of their opportunities, what they'll experience once they've wandered outside the luxury hotel perimeter is the world's most fervent grass-roots cricket culture. It's only when you watch a gang of raggedy kids construct a wicket from a couple of bricks on a gravel-strewn vacant lot next to a shanty town, and then watch them play a pick-up game with fire and flair worthy of a one-day international, that you realise the creative intensity of south Asian cricket, and the scale of its betrayal. </p> <p>\u0095 Mike Marqusee is the author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties (Verso, paperback) which has been voted one of 25 'Books to Remember, 1999' by the New York Public Library.</p> <p><strong>The accused and the accusers </strong></p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong><br>The King Commission of Inquiry set up after the Hansie Cronje revelations in April heard extensive testimony from players and officials indicating the extent of matchfixing in international cricket. It was revealed that the entire South African team held a meeting to discuss whether or not to accept bribes to throw a match in 1996. As a result of its preliminary findings, Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams were banned from international cricket for six months. Gibbs was fined \u00a36,000 and Williams \u00a31,000. Meanwhile King Commission chief prosecutor Shamila Batohi has visited India to exchange information (and tape recordings) with the Indian police. Further investigations are currently under way and a final report is still pending.</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong><br>After much delay, Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum's report into matchfixing was published in May. As a result of its recommendations, Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman were banned for life; six other leading internationals - including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Saeed Anwar - were fined $2,000-$6,000. Akram is considering an appeal. According to the report, he was given 'the benefit of the doubt' but is now 'too sullied' to serve as captain and should be kept under 'strict vigilance' while a further probe is made into his finances.</p> <p><strong>India</strong><br>The Central Bureau of Investigation is now said to be finalising its mammoth report, which should be made available to the Sports Minister this month. It may implicate at least two Indian cricketers and several foreigners in illegal activities. The selecters decided not to wait for the report, and have already dropped four of the 'tainted' players - Muhammad Azharuddin (pictured above with his wife), Ajay Jadeja, Nikhil Chopra and Nayan Mongia - ostensibly 'on merit'. National team coach Kapil Dev has also been forced to resign.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong><br>Shane Warne and Mark Waugh were fined for accepting money from bookmakers in 1995; the Australian Board hushed up the incident, which only became public in 1998.</p> <p><strong>England</strong><br>Have yet to make public their investigation into the match-fixing allegations made by Chris Lewis. It is rumoured that English cricketers may be among those to be named in the Indian CBI report.</p> <p><strong>ICC </strong><br>Cricket's governing body has established a Code of Conduct Commission, chaired by Lord Griffiths, a former High Court judge and president of the MCC.

  "<p><strong> Wembley special: Towers exclusive</strong> </p> <p>Plans to move the famous twin towers to the new national rugby league museum in Widnes have been threatened by an ambitious proposal to ship out and reconstruct them at the base of the Annapurna mountains in Nepal, according to a document passed to Observer Sport. The plan, a rival to the \u00a33m bid backed by Halton Borough Council, is the brainchild of a Nepalese multi-millionaire who made his money from selling Indian food in Britain. An artist's impression of the scheme shows only half the story: The idea is to incorporate the towers into a new syncretic centre of unified Hindu, Buddhist and Tantric worship. The millionaire is said to have visited Wembley in 1989 for the Sherpa Van Trophy final between Bolton and Torquay, since when he has wanted to recreate the binding 'venue of legends' spirit in rural Nepal. 'He's a big fan of the beautiful towers,' says a bid insider. 'He believes they will bring great peace and happiness to our people, as they have done in Brent for 77 years.' An FA spokesman denied knowledge of the scheme and said the artist's impression looked 'remarkably like the new menu cover from the Wembley Tandoori'. </p> <p><strong> Win: top tickets, top night</strong> </p> <p>Just hours before demolition begins, Wembley will host a massive New Year's Eve-style farewell bash: tickets are on sale now (020 8947 1881), but we've a top-of-the-range pair to give away.

Gil was challenged over the expenses last week by administrators investigating Atletico's debts. They found 150 million pesetas had been spent on dubious items - with baby clothes, perfume and kitchen accessories among the other items on Gil's list of essentials. Gil, though, says they were gifts for visiting officials. 'No one told me there was a prohibition on panties and bras,' Gil told the court.

  "<p>The Temple pub nestles between two redundant steel factories on Rotherham's Sheffield Road. Licensing laws notwithstanding, it used to be heaving with steel workers 24 hours a day. Last Monday at 5.30pm, there were just three drinkers in the Temple. On the juke box, Elton John was singing 'Don't let the sun go down on me'. It already has. </p> <p>Next door to the Temple in a cavernous former British Steel factory, frantic workers are rushing to create a \u00a337 million theme park based on the steel and coal industry in time for its Easter opening next year. The factory once employed 1,500 people. When Magna opens next year, 150 will run it. </p> <p>Senior staff at Magna know that if this Lottery-funded project is to work and win the respect of sceptical locals, new companies, in particular multi-media firms, will have to locate to the fringes of this huge site. Visitor attractions, after all, have a limited shelf-life. As catalysts of regeneration, they don't always work. </p> <p>But as things stand few businesses would dream of coming to Rotherham or South Yorkshire. This is because skills levels here are among the worst in the country. A workforce whose members for generations were guaranteed a job didn't need to pay any attention at school. Their children, seeing how their dads were thrown on the scrapheap with no alternative offered, gave up. The result? A deep socio-economic crisis. </p> <p>In Grimethorpe, home to the famous colliery brass band, heroin and crack pose serious problems for this small, resilient community. Residents in sink estates outside Doncaster literally air their dirty washing for all to see as whey-faced kids roam the streets with nothing to do. And the last time Rotherham hit the front pages? The discovery last year that a 12-year-old girl was expecting a baby fathered by a 14-year-old boy. </p> <p>During the past 15 years there have been various attempts to regenerate South Yorkshire after an estimated 160,000 workers lost jobs in the coal, steel and engineering industries. The Tories, having destroyed 'the enemy within', set up City Challenge funds to rebuild communities. The trouble was, these initiatives placed the emphasis on bricks and mortar regeneration assuming that businesses would flock to the area to take up the slack once foundations were in place. They didn't. </p> <p>After Tory Minister Michael Heseltine rang the death knell of the coal industry in 1992, an emergency package of aid was set up. This included Single Regeneration Budget funds. The trouble is that rival regions compete for funds and more than half the applicants fail. The failures are normally from communities that do not have the resources to plough into a coherent bid - the very communities which SRB funds are there to help. </p> <p>Swept to power on a wave of optimism in 1997, the Labour Party pledged to revitalise depressed coal mining communities. Its response to the Coalfields Taskforce was considered to be the most important step forward for England's mining communities for decades. </p> <p>Three years later, progress has been made. The Government has set up the Coalfield Regeneration Trust with \u00a355m to plough into community-led initiatives over three years. One year down the line, grants worth \u00a320m have been committed. It is now crucial that the CRT extends its funding for another three years. Negotiations are ongoing. </p> <p>The Government has allowed English Partnerships, the regeneration quango, to assume control of most of the coalfields to fast-track redevelopment. </p> <p>But progress in transferring the coalfields has been held up by lease complications and a recent EU judgment which ruled government intervention on regeneration sites as 'anti-competitive'. </p> <p>The Government has set a framework by which South Yorkshire can fight back, but what could really make a difference to the region is a \u00a3700m EU Objective One grant announced last July which, as it has to be, will be matched by another \u00a3700m from the Government. </p> <p>Objective One grants are given to areas deemed to be poverty stricken, and there are many Yorkshire folk who see the windfall as confirmation of abject failure. Action plans by the local Regional Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward, are being fine-tuned, but most money will be spent on education, training and employment opportunities. </p> <p>Objective One cash, despite having lost \u00a350m in value since the collapse of the euro, is seen by those in the area as its last chance to get itself on an even keel. </p> <p>'EU enlargement means that other countries will get it in the future,' explained Mike Bower, acting deputy director of the Yorkshire's Objective One project team. 'We won't get this amount of cash from Europe again.' </p> <p>If handled correctly, this cash could lever another \u00a3400m of public and private money into the area, making a total of \u00a31.8 billion. That it might be wasted is the great fear preoccupying South Yorkshire. </p> <p>'Inevitably, we'll get duplication on the ground. With so many agencies, local councils, employment organisations, training bodies, it gets very complicated. I don't know the answer,' said Sara Turton, Yorkshire Forward's Learning &amp; Skills manager. </p> <p>But for those who have been thrown on the scrapheap, egos, corruption and inefficiency cannot be tolerated. This is South Yorkshire's last chance. It must not be blown. </p> <p><strong>Carving out a new living</strong></p> <p>It would take a hard man not to be inspired by the Wildwood project next to the former Bentley mine in South Yorkshire. The project was set up last year with \u00a3250,000 of grants from the Church Urban Fund, Coalfield Regeneration Trust and the John Paul Getty Junior Trust. </p> <p>The initiative trains the long-term unemployed in making furniture from recycled wood. Later this month, it is forecast that Wildwood will scoop a Chambers of Trade Investors in People award. </p> <p>The project is currently driven by the vicar of Bentley and a former deputy managing director of the Scotsman newspaper group. </p> <p>In this financial year, Wildwood has turned over \u00a39,000 in sales. It has got a long way to go to be self-financing. </p> <p>But it has just won a contract to supply a local museum with exhibition cabinets, is identifying other niche markets and is talking to retail partners to sell products ranging from mahogany dining tables, toy boxes and garden furniture. </p> <p>Such is the energy and drive pulsing through Wildwood that you don't think those involved in it will allow it to fail. </p> <p>Graduates from its courses have either been employed within the company or have found employment outside it. Only two have given up, both through ill-health.</p> <p><strong>Retraining delivers jobs</strong></p> <p>With numbers in the coal and steel industries slashed, unions have found it hard to adapt to the post-industrial age. </p> <p>But ISTC, the principal steel union, has over the last year increased its numbers by 7 per cent to nearly 35,000 thanks to retraining ex-steel workers. It is the first time a British union has taken this approach - using a model which came from the United States. </p> <p>Staffed largely by redundant steel workers, its new body, the Steel Training Partnership, counsels those put out of work, offers them training and tries to find them new jobs. </p> <p>The organisation is held back by a lack of IT teachers and the sheer number needing help. </p> <p>In Rotherham, STP has found people jobs in tree surgery, product auditing and telecommunications, and helped a number of non-union members to study for childcare qualifications.</p>",
  "What will happen to the peace dividend if the new power-sharing executive in Belfast collapses? As David Trimble fights for his political life, business leaders fear that Northern Ireland's economic recovery will be put at risk if the new devolved institutions are seen to falter. <p> Since the Belfast Agreement was signed in 1998, economic progress has been dramatic. The so-called peace dividend is immediately visible in the scale of new buildings - hotels, office blocks, shopping centres. </p> <p> The Waterfront Hall where David Trimble met the critics within his own party yesterday is a symbol of how things have changed. The airy building stands beside the River Lagan alongside the recently built Hilton Hotel. </p> <p> It is sometimes hard to remember that only a few years ago people were searched as they entered shops and restaurants in Belfast. The official statistics confirm the gains that have been made as a result of the peace process. Once an unemployment black spot, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland is now running below the European Union average. There has been steady success in attracting foreign investment, particularly in hi-tech industries. </p> <p> There are still big problems to be tackled. Northern Ireland's traditional manufacturing industries like shipbuilding are in decline. New jobs will be needed to replace those lost in the police and security firms. These will require people to have different skills, something that can only be achieved by retraining and education. </p> <p> The new assembly at Stormont is currently debating Strategy 2010, an ambitious economic plan which aims to raise Northern Ireland's GDP to 90 per cent of the UK average over the next 10 years. This is a serious consideration of long-term strategy which is far removed from the rancorous scenes when political leaders trade insults over the peace process. </p> <p> But economic progress will be put at risk if the political institutions like the Assembly are seen to falter. Peace isn't just a matter of lack of violence on the streets although this is obviously necessary to persuade multi-national companies to invest. </p> <p> Political stability and a sense that Northern Ireland's leaders are ready and able to take control of the economy are also necessary. So George Quigley, Chairman of Ulster Bank and one of the province's most respected businessmen, believes that the role of the Assembly is vital in deciding policy and ensuring that economic targets are achieved. He points to the role which political leaders 'and an almost obsessive drive for economic growth' have played in shaping the success of the Republic's economy. </p> <p> This has been missing in Northern Ireland for obvious reasons. Direct rule has meant that local politicians have lacked the clout to lobby effectively in the corridors of power. Thirty years of violence have taken a very heavy toll on the infrastructure. The province benefits from transfers of \u00a36 billion from the British Exchequer, but Northern Ireland has been unable to match the tax incentives which have brought foreign investors to the Republic and this will only change if the Treasury can be persuaded, by local politicians, that the province needs special consideration. </p> <p> Some of the problems remain outside the control of the local politicians, but many important decisions on funding for education, the environment, health and so on are being taken by local Ministers at Stormont. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, has warned that the flow of investment and economic benefits that have been a result of the Good Friday Agreement could slow down if the peace process continues to lurch from crisis to crisis. </p> <p> The emphasis in the media over the next few weeks, as unionists for and against the Belfast Agreement argue over Trimble's future, will be on bitterly divisive issues like policing and the handover of IRA weapons. Hospital closures, the threat to Belfast shipbuilders Harland &amp; Wolff and the debate on the 11+ exam will hardly rate a mention. These are issues of huge importance to most of the people in Northern Ireland, and they would like to see decisions on them being made by local politicians. That opportunity will be lost if the executive collapses.</p>",
  "<p> On Zanzibar, the local television station has been known to set up a camera on a street corner and leave it there for hours, broadcasting live: fragments of conversation; the odd car; women walking past in full purdah. A sort of low-budget Muslim Big Brother . Rewind the tape a few centuries and the people passing by would have been Portuguese, Arab and English merchants fighting over this lush trading post in the Indian Ocean. Unjuga (Zanzibar's Swahili name) had sugar and spice and, not so nice, a roaring slave trade. Up to 30,000 Africans were sold here every year for most of the nineteenth century. </p> <p>Today, there's an internet caf\u00e9 in Stonetown, but it's tucked away in a maze of streets where Indian balconies, colonial verandahs and the deserted palaces of Omani sultans quietly crumble into the sea. The voices of children singing the Koran really do ambush you in sidestreets. Zanzibar's slave market has disappeared under an Anglican cathedral. The hotel where I'm staying is built alongside the ruins of a missionary school for freed slave girls (a cousin of William Thackeray was headmistress). Now a woman from Oxfordshire gives great aromatherapy massages there. </p> <p>Tourism is still at the polite stage. There is, as yet, no Freddie Mercury heritage trail (the singer was born here), no festival of Babar (the elephant was born here, too). Developers are only just beginning to flout the law that says you can't build higher than the surrounding palm trees. Go now, while the beaches are postcard-perfect: white sand, green sea, the triangular sail of a lone dhow. </p> <p>You can buy moonstones on Mastercard; you should book for dinner at Emerson's &amp; Green, a hotel run by three gay Americans. Or simply barter for bangles on the seafront with Masai craftsmen, then turn up at Two Tables on the off-chance. There are only two tables, crammed on to a balcony; no menu - you eat what's put in front of you. After settling up, the owner may switch on a ghetto blaster and his teenage daughters may appear at the door in headdresses and livid lipstick, and dance round the living room to taarab music looking daggers. </p> <p>Everybody I know who's been to Zanzibar has been on a spice tour, but don't let that put you off. It's the best way to get up into the island's jungle interior, along empty avenues of skyscraping coconut trees, past boys on bicycles too big for them, to a sunny plantation where you can stick your nose into handfuls of vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon and lemon grass that Jamie Oliver could only dream of. </p> <p>Finally, if you do go to Zanzibar, leave! There's a tiny strip of land eight miles away on the horizon and it's even better. Chumbe Island (pronounced Choom-bay), all 1km by 300 metres of it, sounds a bit worthy: it's a nature reserve which beat 115 projects from 42 countries last year to win British Airways' Global Tourism for Tomorrow award. But the fun starts the minute the boat picks you up from Zanzibar after breakfast, pitches and churns through crystal water towards Chumbe's dense treeline and white lighthouse, and (oh goody) drops you off in the shallows to wade ashore holding your possessions aloft as if arriving for a Robinson Crusoe convention. </p> <p>That night we all drink champagne and Tangawizi (kicking local ginger beer) in the dramatic vaulted remains of the lighthouse keeper's house: candles guttering, sea crashing all around, food delicious (plantain, fish, curries, real coconut rice). </p> <p> Chumbe Coral Park was founded by Sibylle Riedmiller, a German environmentalist in her seventies who visited the uninhabited island in 1991 and was overwhelmed by its pristine coral-rag forest and shallow-water reef - protected, oddly enough, by lying close to the Dar es Salaam shipping route which has been off-limits to fishermen since colonial times. Six years and $600,000 of her own money later, Riedmiller finally persuaded the Tanzanian government, which owns Chumbe, to turn it into an eco-resort for the free education of local children. Many can't swim. In Swahili, there is no word for coral. </p> <p>The project is proudly self-reliant thanks to tourism. Only 14 overnight guests are allowed on the island at a time and they must have 'zero impact' on the fragile eco-system. Ideally there would be no visitors, but every drop of income from the honeymooners and stressed executives who stay here is invested in conservation and education. If all goes to plan, the running of Chumbe will one day be a purely Zanzibari affair. </p> <p>Life quickly telescopes into little things: the fresh pincer tracks of coconut crabs in the morning; the hide-and-seek exertions of a hermit crab intent on commuting across the sand. At low tide, Chumbe acquires an aircraft-carrier overhang you can walk under looking for starfish. It takes about 40 minutes to circle the island. Climb the 131 steps of the lighthouse, built by the British in 1904, and you get the full 24-hectare extent of a place so thick with vegetationno one has seen its rare deer population in years. </p> <p>Chumbe's project manager, Eleanor Carter, an ecologist (from Slough), heard about her dream job while working as a pianist at a bar in Stonetown. She trains local fishermen as park rangers who patrol the island to prevent illegal fishing, record scientific observations, and help sad specimens like me who have never knowingly snorkelled to put on flippers and get vertigo over shoals of barracuda, gainly turtles and little fish of the Everton mint family. </p> <p>You know that Chumbe is a labour of love the moment you clap eyes on your state-of-the-art eco-bungalow, or banda , where gothic thatch meets salvage chic. There are seven of them, each with a hammock made from washed-up driftnet, and shipwrecked-crockery mosaics. Solar panels heat the rainwater collected by the roof; there's a compost toilet. </p> <p>For air-conditioning, the banda has no front wall; it's just you and the Indian Ocean. When the wind picks up, the whole structure shakes and chirrups and takes on a life of its own. Lower the drawbridge shutter of your sleeping deck at night and you can watch the lights of fishing boats, 10 or 11 of them, lined up out to sea like an invading army in the pitch black. If nature were not so loud you would sleep like a log.</p> <p><strong>Finding an environmental winner </strong></p> <p>Lizzie Ashcroft, a 17-year-old sixth-former from Leeds who was chosen in an Observer competition to be the young judge on the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow Awards, meets David Bellamy, the panel's chairman.

  "At the giant Kolubara coalfield, 30 miles to the south of Belgrade, even the ground and trees are black. It is a sombre and funereal place. Amid the hills of slag, vast buildings and cranes rise out of a flat wasteland, punctuated occassionally by grinding open conveyor belts and pools of filthy water. But for all its dreariness, the mine and its 7,500 miners, who produce half of all Serbia's coal, is a place resonant in Serbian folk lore. It was here the Serbs fought and won their most famous victory of the First World War, when they turned back the Austro-Hungarian army. <p>The Kolubarska Bitka - the Kolubara Battle - became part of modern nationalist mythology when Dobrica Cosic featured it in his novel Time of Death. Today the mine is being celebrated for a different reason: as the place that finally brought down Slobodan Milosevic; as Serbia's own Gdansk. </p> <p>If the beginning of the end of Slobodan Milosevic's bloody reign came anywhere, it was not in the dreary corridors of power, nor in the cramped offices of the Yugoslav electoral commission which tried to steal last month's elections, but under the vast arc lights of Kolubara where Milosevic made his most serious mistake, misinterpreting the mood of a group of workers he had relied on throughout his regime. </p> <p>That mistake, as he clung on to power in his last days, was to send his army chief of staff General Nebojsa Pavkovic late last Monday night to try to persuade the striking miners to stop their protests. The general is the son of a miner. Milosevic's hope was that this would help him talk the miners' language and tell them their strike was counter-productive. </p> <p>It backfired. Instead it was the miners who did the talking, persuading the man who controls the Yugoslav armed forces that their anger and determination was such that to use force against them would be too risky. </p> <p>As Pavkovic travelled between the different areas of the huge open-cast pit he was politely received. Crucially, however, the miners refused to promise they would halt their action. And following behind him was a second military figure whose presence was to prove the key to holding the strike. This man was General Momcilo Perisic, Pavkovic's predecessor as chief of the general staff, sacked by Milosevic early on in the Kosovo crisis after warning the President that it was futile to use the army as a tool of repression there. Now Perisic was standing with the Opposition. His interventions over the next week - first with the miners then with his former army colleagues as hundreds of thousands took to the streets of Belgrade - would prove his ex-master's undoing. </p> <p>'I got to two sections of the mine after Pavkovic and managed to firm up their line,' he told The Observer yesterday. 'Then I moved on to the third section and talked to the men there shortly before Pavkovic arrived. As a result, he didn't even get a hearing. They whistled and refused to listen'. </p> <p>It was both a lesson and a humiliation for Pavkovic, an ultra-loyalist, who was totally dependent on the President. His wife is related to Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, and he is building a mansion in Uzicka Street in the posh suburb of Dedinje, not far from the Milosevics' former home. </p> <p>If even Pavkovic was hesitant about using troops against the protesters, who else would be willing to do so? 'I was in contact with 80 per cent of the generals, urging them not to let the army be abused,' says Perisic, 'though it was the role of the colonels which was crucial.' </p> <p>Instead Pavkovic's public statements were ambiguous - which in itself was bad for Milosevic. The army chief repeated that the army would uphold the constitution and respect the will of the people. The words were mealy-mouthed but they were enough. On the streets people interpreted his statement as meaning that there would be no intervention. </p> <p>It was, perhaps, as well. For as the full story of the past three days has slowly emerged it has been revealed that many of the Opposition supporters who poured into Belgrade for the decisive showdown with Milosevic on Thursday had come prepared to fight if they were attacked. </p> <p>According to reliable opposition sources, up to 10,000 activists were armed, while several squads of former soldiers had been specially trained to storm Yugoslavia's parliament and television station, as part of a high-risk strategy to oust Milosevic. According to the same sources, former reservists from the opposition towns of Mladenovac, just south of Belgrade, and Kragujevac and Cacak in central Serbia came ready to fight in a strategy organised by Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic. </p> <p>'They were all males. They were ready to fight and some of them told me that they left and said goodbye to their wives and children as if they were going to war. They had decided that they had to win. It is scary, but it worked,' said one source. Reliable sources said: 'The guys who came from Cacak are all reservists who have been actively trained for a couple of days as to what they were going to do.' </p> <p>Yesterday, as Vojislav Kostunica was inaugurated as Yugoslavia's new President, the miners of the Kolubara pit were being feted as the heroes of a week that the graffiti artists on every Belgrade street corner are celebrating as the October Revolution. And as Serbs gathered to mark their new President's ascent to office, they had other news to celebrate: the flight of Slobodan Milosevic's hated son Marko and his family on a scheduled flight for Moscow. </p> <p>The news of his escape came as Zarko Korac, one of the leading members of the opposition coalition behind Kostunica, told The Observer that they intended to press criminal charges that 'the former President had tried to order the police and army to fire on demonstrators on Thursday'. They were orders that his security forces ignored, taking the same view as Pavkovic that the game was up for Slobo. </p> <p>It was a message that was not lost on the junior ranks of the army and police, who for long had indicated privately to the opposition that to turn their weapons on their own people was the atrocity they judged too far. The crunch moment that saw the end of Milosevic's 13-year rule came on Thursday afternoon as it had become clear that police units were siding with the protesters, or at least making no moves against them. </p> <p>It was not just in Belgrade that the police surrendered to the will of people power. In Nis, Pirot and other provincial towns police officers had refused orders to come to Belgrade on Thursday to defend the capital. Even the army units that were deployed on Thursday in Belgrade - the 72nd Brigade - were held at their barracks with instructions to defend the Dedinje home of Milosevic and the presidential offices rather than to intervene. </p> <p>Final confirmation of Milosevic's defeat came from General Pavkovic himself - the man Milosevic had asked to save him - when he too finally recognised the new President after talking to both Perisic and Kostunica. </p> <p>But if Pavkovic's acceptance of Kostunica was the most important confirmation that the opposition was safe in power, the bizarrest moment was the turnaround of both Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court and Federal Election Commission which on Friday said that they had been behind an attempt to defraud Kostunica of his election victory but, since they had been rumbled, were now happy to confess the fact and that Kostunica had in fact been duly elected President on 24 September. </p> <p>It was what everyone had always known: Milosevic had attempted his most ambitious coup, and lost, by lying to the people who had for so long supported him. </p> <p>'You just don't understand,' said Professor Korac, snatching a Coke as he rushed between meetings. 'This is not a transition, it is an absolute revolution, it is a collapse!' Korac said that opposition leaders were now debating what to do as they would have preferred to take over in a legal manner. On paper both the Serbian and Yugoslav governments still exist. Korac said that it was now clear that no one was in control in either Serbian or Federal Yugoslav ministries as the former Ministers had gone to ground while employees were appealing to opposition leaders to take over. 'They are empty, no one is in charge.' Korac said that the only institution which was still working properly was 'thankfully' the army. </p> <p>One worry for the opposition and Kostunica is that Milosevic's allies still control the organs of power in Serbia. That is because in Yugoslavia's federal system most power is devolved to the Serbian and Montenegrin republican institutions. In principle, the police in Serbia are still answerable to the Serbian Minister of Interior and the Serbian president is Milan Milutinovic, an indicted war criminal. </p> <p>'We were in touch with Milutinovic,' said Korac yesterday 'but he just does not understand what is going on. These people are all like orphans without Milosevic. You know when Stalin died the people around him were so frightened they could not touch his body for 15 minutes! It is like that here.' </p> <p>And despite announcing that they intended to press charges against Milosevic, opposition politicians admitted yesterday that they did not actually know where he was. It is believed that he came specially to Belgrade on Friday for meetings with both Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Kostunica and then left the city again. </p> <p>That Russian meeting appears to have been the key to Milosevic's surrender of power as Ivanov informed him that he would have no support from Moscow if he attempted to cling on. </p> <p>Yesterday, Ivanov was coy about that crucial meeting, although he said that he and Milosevic did not discuss guarantees for the outgoing Yugoslav President during the meeting. 'I will be honest, we did not touch upon it. We spoke not about the fate of a concrete person or party, but about the fate of Yugoslavia.' </p> <p>And it is the very fate of Yugoslavia itself - the federation of Serbia and its reluctant smaller republic of Montenegro that is now on the table, as Montenegro vowed yesterday to bolt for independence from Yugoslavia unless the new President immediately withdrew troops from its territory placed there by Milosevic to prevent secession. The tiny republic said it would consign the Yugoslav federation to history unless its ultimatum was met within days. </p> <p>Tension in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica mounted as the government waited for Belgrade's response. Streets remained bereft of the jubilant crowds thronging Serbia. 'We are waiting for Kostunica to dismantle the structures set up by Milosevic which are creating horrible numbers of provocations. He should withdraw these troops now,' said Dragisa Burzan, Montenegro's deputy Prime Minister. Relief at Milosevic's fall was tinged with fear that his successor may prove even more hostile to separatist desires. Montenegro and Serbia are the last two republics in the federation of Yugoslavia. </p> <p>'We are expecting dialogue. We are expecting the West to influence Kostunica and to tone down his rhetoric,' said Burzan. </p> <p>Unless rapid agreement was reached on key demands a referendum would be called, he said. Burzan's comments reflect deep disquiet within Montenegro over the future direction for Kostunica over issues such as Montenegro and Kosovo, with some Montenegrins privately expressing deep disquiet. 'Kostunica could be even worse than Slobo,' said one. </p> <p>At issue is Kostunica's warning during the election that he would defend the federation. Indeed his impeccable credentials as a strong Serb who would not kowtow to the West was one of the reasons he won. Fears over Kostunica's policy over Montenegro are also being driven by his need to make a deal with former Milosevic supporters who want to keep ties with Belgrade. Because independence supporters boycotted the 24 September election, the SNP swept up all of Montenegro's seats in the federal parliament, presenting a formidable block which Kostunica needs to consolidate power, it claimed. </p> <p>Yesterday the people of Belgrade had little time for the question of Montenegro's future amid jubilant scenes as the city prepared for the swearing-in of its new president. The 178 deputies of the Yugoslav Chamber of Citizens and the upper house, the Chamber of Republics, elected 13 days ago, met in the Sava convention centre to bring down the curtain on the Milosevic era with due formality there was one notable absentee from the gathering - Mira Markovic, Milosevic's wife and leader of the YUL party. It was perhaps a wise decision, for as the Milosevic loyalist and Serbian President Milan Milutinovic walked in, the chamber echoed to the sound of boos. </p> <p>The mood was summed up by former Yugoslav president Dobrica Cosic who said Serbia was at a crossroads and that the revolt showed the deep suffering of the Yugoslav people. 'Awakened by terrible national losses and long suffering, humiliated by poverty and injustice in a backward, corrupt and criminal society, people decided to change that order: the federal state, authorities, economy, judiciary, education, army, police and all other social institutions,' Cosic said. </p> <p>The new mood was echoed around the Serbian capital, whose residents were plunged into despair by last year's Nato bombing of Yugoslavia and years of West-imposed sanctions. At one store, a shopkeeper handed out a bag of free bread to a passer-by, to celebrate. </p> <p>The most poignant scenes, however, were reserved for the exclusive Dedinje suburb, site of the official presidential residence, once the heavily guarded home of Milosevic and his wife. In the early hours of yesterday morning, Milosevic's opponents finally reached the gates of his former house, as cars drove through the streets of Dedinje waving flags out of their windows and hooting their horns in a symbolic gesture of people power triumphing over repression. </p> <p>Indeed, cries of 'Let's go to Dedinje!' had long been a rallying call for the hundreds of protest marches against him during Milosevic's 13-year rule. Almost every time protesters tried to reach the suburb, home to Milosevic and his close associates as well as diplomats and former Socialist apparatchiks, lines of riot police blocked their path and beat back anyone who tried to break through. </p> <p>Yesterday, however, the guards deserted the White Palace, which became his home after a cruise missile hit the residence in Uzicka street where he lived until the Nato bombing campaign last year. </p> <p>'We were in shock how everything Milosevic epitomised collapsed so quickly,' said opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic yesterday, surveying the demise of Milosevic's regime. 'We always though that Milosevic would not go without a bloody fight. But we were wrong. We overestimated the strength of the dictator and his pillars of power,' he added. </p> <p> <b>Useful Links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.izbori2000.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.izbori2000.net</a> Free Serbia</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dos.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dos.org.yu</a> Democratic Opposition of Serbia</p>",
  "<p><strong> Faces: the Creative Process behind Great Portraits</strong><br>Jane Bown<br> Collins &amp; Brown \u00a319.99, pp160</p> <p> Last summer, the National Portrait Gallery was in the last stages of organising an exhibition, Faces of a Century. It involved 10 people choosing 10 photographs to document their and the nation's experience of the last century. We realised that we were going to need good quality photographs of the selectors themselves in order to indicate that the interest of the exhibition was as much in their prejudices and preoccupations as in what they selected. </p> <p>So we needed a professional photographer who could work quickly, who was not going to antagonise the selectors and who could produce images with an appropriate sense of authority. </p> <p>There was only one person who fitted the bill: Jane Bown, The Observer's house photographer. She took nine of the 10 photographs we needed in the space of a month without fuss, with minimal payment, and producing images which everyone, including the selectors, greatly admired.</p> <p>Jane Bown has now published an account of her working method, which is admirably straightforward, unfussy and professional, the result of years of experience as a newspaper photographer and light years away in every aspect from the narcissism of the American studio photographers who arrive for a sitting with a panoply of professional assistants, a lorry-load of equipment, and then take rolls and rolls of film from which one shot may be selected, too often over-contrived. </p> <p>Jane Bown, on the other hand, arrives wherever she is asked to go with an old Olympus dating from the early 1960s, finds a good spot, preferably close a good source of natural daylight, fiddles with the exposure and then takes a single roll of film, occasionally two, from which she almost invariably selects either the first photograph or the last. The skill is to get the sitter to relax, to show themselves as they want to be. The character of the portrait lies in the lines of the face and its expression. </p> <p>After a magnificently succinct introduction, which says everything which needs to be said about her life and the way she works in three pages, she gets on to what interests her - the images themselves. One feels as if one is going through an album of her life, with her at one's elbow, making useful comments, sometimes about the personality of the sitter, the circumstances of the sitting, sometimes about the background or composition, and sometimes what she likes about the result, beginning with a photograph of Edith Sitwell, magnificent, overdressed and asleep. </p> <p>There are some wonderful images, some familiar, some not. I have often seen reproduced the photograph of John Betjeman laughing by the Cornish seaside, but I had not realised that it is by Jane Bown. But I had never seen a brilliant and slightly tragic picture of Betjeman talking to Philip Larkin at a memorial service at Christ Church. Betjeman is all waistcoat and hands in pockets, looking up at Larkin who is unexpectedly bird-like and neat. </p> <p>As I leafed through the book, my admiration for her skill grew and grew. She started with Jean Cocteau in 1950 when she was only 24. In the 1950s, she took some amazing photographs. For example, there is a portrait of Vita Sackville-West at the front of Sissinghurst. It is in an image with an extraordinary range of textures in the face, the coat, the door, the space beyond. Bown's comments are fantastically laconic. Of this photograph, she says only that she likes the composition. </p> <p>In the 1960s, she took some fine pop photographs although she would certainly not think of herself as a pop photographer, including the young Paul McCartney with a cigarette in his hand looking like the young art student he then was. In 1969, she photographed No\u00ebl Coward in a pose which makes him look like a great statesman. All she writes of the latter is that it has a good, strong diagonal. </p> <p>How much art is there in these photographs? The answer is that there is a great deal more than the photographer will admit. For example, there is an extremely beautiful portrait of Lady Diana Mosley taken in Paris. Bown implies that the beauty of the photograph lies in the beauty of her sitter, which, to an extent, is true. But there is also a strong element of classicism in the composition, in the balance between the shape of the head and the topiary beyond, the slant of the grass and the stripes of the dress, the directness of the face and the way it is framed. All she says of this photograph is: 'There are some interesting shapes.' It is an amazing image, incredibly strong, equalled perhaps only by her photograph of Samuel Beckett. </p> <p>Her photographs are as good today as they were 50 years ago and she includes many examples of her recent work, including Michael Barrymore as a matin\u00e9e idol. It may be wondered why she is not regarded, as she deserves to be, as a great photographer. </p> <p>The answer to this also lies in the book, as she is so systematically commonsensical, so wilfully unself-important, so studiedly unpretentious, even on occasion annoyingly offhand, that it is obvious that, too often, other people may share her own confident, but unself-aggrandising estimation of her own work. They are wrong. </p> <p>Some of her photographs, especially those of the old and, I'm afraid to say, most often of men, are seriously great.</p>",
  "It would really be jumping the gun, churlish even, to announce that the honeymoon is over. Of course it isn't. It has barely begun! Tomorrow European Union Ministers will begin the process of dismantling the sanctions that have helped to keep Serbia isolated and impoverished. The US and other Western nations will follow suit. Within weeks diplomatic relations will be restored with Belgrade. <p>With joyous small ceremonies there'll be a rush of flag-raising over embassies and, if all goes well, Tito's ghost, which haunts Manhattan's East River, will finally be laid to rest. </p> <p>That ghost is, of course, the old Yugoslavia that died at the hands of Slobodan Milosevic. Thanks to a bizarre series of diplomatic manoeuvrings the old Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which stretched from the Alpine hills of Slovenia to the dry plains of Macedonia, still exists as a 'member' of the United Nations. The East River and the UN's Palais des Nations in Geneva are the last places on Earth where the old red-starred flag of Tito's country still flies. </p> <p>Not for long. Soon, no doubt, President Kostunica's Yugoslavia will have sorted out its status along with its re-entry into the plethora of international bodies - primarily the financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. </p> <p>Western Ministers should also soon begin signing cheques for the millions of dollars earmarked for a post-Milosevic Serbia under the terms of the Stability Pact, intended to aid and integrate all of the Balkan states. </p> <p>So far so good. But, then a few weeks or months down the line the country will wake with a sore head. The empty coffers, the factories good for nothing but scrap, the small farmers who find it hard to compete in a global market. And, of course, the equally tough questions of Kosovo and responsibility for almost a decade of wars. </p> <p>In the short term Kostunica and his supporters will have to clear out the institutions of all the vestiges of the ancien regime . Because of the curious nature of Yugoslavia's constitutional set-up Milosevic's allies still control the parliament, government and presidency of Serbia. The recent elections were for the Yugoslav parliament and presidency. But as Milosevic and all his friends began to congratulate Kostunica on his victory on Friday, it began to look suspiciously as if many of them intended to try to hang on to their posts. </p> <p>Until Friday it had been assumed that once Milosevic had gone the whole apparatus of state he had created would go with him. Now, the situation is less clear, despite the obvious power vacuum. </p> <p>In principle, President Kostunica should soon be able to lay the ghost of Montenegrin secessionism because most Montenegrins were not anti-Yugoslav as much as anti-Milosevic. But this may be far more difficult than it at first appeared, because Kostunica and his supporters need the votes of the Montenegrin party that used to support Milosevic in the federal parliament if they are to form the next Yugoslav Government. They may succeed but if they do, they will alienate the pro-Western President of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic. </p> <p>As the economists begin to examine the accounts of Serbian industry, they will discover not only the mass of debt but also that, as Serbia is rapidly reintegrated into the rest of Europe, most of it will no longer be able to compete. Ten years ago, for example, there was little to choose between a Yugo car and a Czech Skoda. Now Skodas compete on an equal footing with cars from the world's top manufacturers but the old Zastava factory which makes Yugos produces barely 5,000 a year. Unemployment will rise. Sanctions and isolation have impoverished Serbia but they have also helped protect uncompetitive domestic production. That shield will go. </p> <p> </p> <p>The war criminals issue is one that is bound to dog Kostunica. A lawyer by training, he has denounced the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as a 'monstrous institution' and regards it as a political court set up to condemn Serbs. The question is whether the West will decide to keep quiet over the issue or continue to demand that Serbia hand over Milosevic. </p> <p>Until Friday it looked as though Milosevic was a hunted man. Then he met Kostunica, congratulated him on his victory and said that he intended to remain as head of the Socialist Party of Serbia and continue in political life. If he does this, with Kostunica's blessing - and if other high-level indictees, including the President of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, do the same thing - then a frost may descend on relations between Serbia and the West. So far it is too early to say: yesterday morning opposition sources said that they intended to press criminal charges against Milosevic for ordering the police to fire on demonstrators last Thursday. </p> <p>In Belgrade, human rights activists are divided as to what the recent developments mean. Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Centre, says that she believes the international community 'will not stop talking about the issue'. Others are more sceptical, fearing that in their rush to welcome back Serbia to the fold of normal countries the whole question will simply be swept under the carpet. </p> <p>Kosovo is another issue that is bound to help end the Kostunica honeymoon. Kostunica has said that Nato troops are in Kosovo thanks to Milosevic. He has emphasised that Kosovo is part of Serbia and he intends to seek its return. In fact, whatever any Serbian leader says, Kosovo's Albanians will never agree to any association with Belgrade again, and in the short-term attacks on Kosovo Serbs may increase lest anyone think that a new spirit of reconciliation is abroad. </p> <p>Until the early hours of yesterday morning tens of thousands were still literally dancing in the streets of Belgrade. Serbia has changed and is changing. But, over the next few weeks and months we may find that it has changed less than expected. </p> <p> Tim Judah is the author of The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia </p> <p> <b>Dictators: Where are they now?</b></p> <p><b> Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier</b></p> <p>Former dictator of Haiti, Duvalier fled in 1986, snatching millions of dollars from the Central Bank.

  "A gang of white youths called 'the Eltham racists' are attacking black people in the London suburb where the black teenager Stephen Lawrence was murdered. <p>A gang of five white men, all believed to be aged about 20, surrounded a black woman and subjected her to a prolonged assault in broad daylight. </p> <p>The woman was in Eltham High Street, about half-a-mile from the place where Lawrence was killed, when she was attacked by the gang. </p> <p>They forced the 38-year-old into a churchyard. One of the youths snatched her bag and hugged it to his chest. 'That's how you have to carry it,' he told her, 'because all the blacks are snatching bags.' </p> <p>The gang shouted that they wanted to force non-whites out of Eltham and return it to white control. 'They were clearly emulating the role models laid before them by those who killed Stephen Lawrence,' the woman said. </p> <p>The incident was the third in which white youths have been heard chanting: 'We are the Eltham racists.' </p> <p>Lawrence was stabbed to death with a 10-inch blade while waiting at a bus stop in Eltham. But none of those believed to be responsible have ever been successfully prosecuted. </p> <p>The case, which uncovered bungling and racism within the police force, led to an overhaul of police procedure. </p> <p>The latest victim survived physically unscathed.

  "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.'</p> <p>Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' </p> <p>The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.'</p> <p>We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,379015,00.html\">Read Philip French's analysis of Poitier's career here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier is published by Simon &amp; Schuster for \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<p>Parents could soon have the right to choose the colour of their baby's hair and eyes. Legal experts say the new Human Rights Act could give parents the right to select the appearance of babies born through in vitro fertilisation, something which is presently banned by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. </p> <p>Last week, Alan and Louise Masterton, from Scotland, caused uproar by invoking the Act, which came in to force last week, to demand the right to select the sex of an embryo, in order to have another baby girl after the death of their only daughter Nicole last year. </p> <p>At present, the HFEA only allows selection of embryos for serious, life-threatening disorders. It has a policy explicitly banning selection for any social, physical or psychological reasons. </p> <p>Jonathan Montgomery, healthcare lawyer at the University of Southampton, and a recognised authority on the law of genetics, said that the Mastertons had a very strong case, and the Act could also open the door for parents to demand the right to chose babies with blond hair and blue eyes. </p> <p>He told the Observer : 'The Human Rights Act means you could challenge the HFEA ban on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis on the basis of physical appearance. It is possible the Act could overturn the ban.' </p> <p>The Human Rights Act, which enshrined the European Convention of Human Rights into UK law, declares that public bodies should not interfere with privacy or family life unless they can justify it in terms of protecting public health or morals, or protecting the rights of others. </p> <p>Until now, the HFEA has had the authority simply to ban anything it considers ethically unacceptable. It has assembled a team of lawyers to predict in what way its authority could be challenged by the new law. </p> <p>In another challenge to the HFEA, the Human Rights Act is being invoked by one doctor in an attempt to overturn the authority's ban on implanting more than three embryos at one time. </p> <p>Montgomery said: 'With the Human Rights Act, the boot is on the other foot. The HFEA would have to prove its right to infringe on people's choice and articulate quite precisely why it thinks it's bad. It would have to justify why it was interfering in terms of public health or morals.' </p> <p>The HFEA may find that difficult. Although many ethicists find the idea of parents selecting blue-eyed babies repugnant, it is not clear how it would damage public health or morals, or infringe the right of others. 'Our instincts are that wanting a blond baby is a rather trivial thing, but the HFEA would have to articulate that ban carefully,' said Montgomery. </p> <p>No embryo has yet been selected on the basis of eye or hair colour anywhere in the world, but it is thought the technology to do so is not far off. It is almost certain that other attributes such as intelligence and beauty will be nearly impossible to select for because they depend on such a wide range of genes, as well as environmental factors. </p> <p>The HFEA has expressed concern about the plight of the Masterton family, although it will retain its ban on selecting babies for gender for social reasons until forced by the Act to relinquish it. According to Montgomery, British courts may well rule in favour of the family. </p> <p>'Is there any legitimate case for saying that the daughter would suffer?' he asked. 'In the absence of anything like that, they would have a strong case under the law respecting family life.' </p> <p>Some medical lawyers insist that sex selection should be banned because it perpetuates wider discrimination in society, usually against girls. But Montgomery said: 'In the Scottish case, it is likely to go in favour of the family, because they are not making any deleterious statements about boys.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a> </p> <p>Useful Links: <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Authority</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bioethics.gov\" target=\"_NEW\">US National Bioethics Advisory Commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.issue.co.uk/dinet\" target=\"_NEW\">IVF and DI parents' network</a></p>",
  "<p>In a few days, fertilisation expert Dr Paul Serhal will attempt a historic operation to eradicate an inherited cancer that has blighted a British family for generations. </p> <p>The disease - a form of bowel cancer known as familial polyposis - has hung like a curse over families, killing half of those afflicted by it. The majority of those who die do so when in their forties and fifties. </p> <p>Now Serhal, based at University College Hospital, London, believes he can free future generations of these families from the grim impact of familial polyposis. He will use 'pre-implantation genetic diagnosis' - growing embryos outside the womb with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), testing to check they don't carry the gene and implanting only healthy embryos. </p> <p>It will be the first time that IVF technology will have been used in Britain to produce children unaffected by the taint of a specific cancer. </p> <p>News of the operation could not come at a more inflammatory time. Last week genetics was propelled on to front pages and news broadcasts. First there was the story of Molly Nash. Finding their daughter afflicted by deadly, inherited Fanconi anaemia, Jack and Lisa Nash, from Colorado, used genetic diagnoses of embryos to give birth to a second child, Adam, who was not only unaffected by the disease, but whose umbilical cord provided life-saving transplant material for Molly. </p> <p>The next day it emerged that a Scottish couple, Alan and Louise Masterton, were planning to use human rights legislation to ensure they could employ similar techniques to ensure they had a daughter, and not a son, to replace their three-year-old Nicole, who died in a fire. </p> <p>We are plunging into a brave new world of designer babies, said the pundits. We have created a realm, they claimed, in which parents can use the slightest excuse to discard 'tainted' embryos, or have children genetically selected as organ factories for other family members. </p> <p>Serhal's work seem to support this fear. After all, familial polyposis does not kill if it is tackled promptly. Those who carry the guilty gene can simply have their colons removed before the disease has a chance to manifest. itself. Discarding affected embryos is unnecessary, say opponents. </p> <p>Serhal is unrepentant. The urge to have a healthy child is natural, he argues. 'All I am doing is ensuring the birth of a child that will be unaffected by cancer in 40 years and will not need major surgery. I am giving parents, and their offspring, peace of mind.' </p> <p>After years of being little more than scientific speculation, genetic testing of embryos is swiftly moving centre stage in the furore over modern medical ethics. Only five hospitals in the UK are licensed to carry out tests - for conditions including spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy - and they have produced a mere total of about 20 'pure' babies. However, as science and acceptance advance, numbers are expected to grow rapidly. </p> <p>British doctors say they are comfortable about screening out the most severe genetic diseases, but are bracing themselves for dilemmas like the Nashes' - of a second test to ensure a baby is genetically acceptable as a tissue donor for a diseased relative. </p> <p>When the Nash story was first made public at a scientific conference earlier this summer, the hall echoed with the sound of stunned scientists gasping. Now the practice is out in the open. So what will happen when it arrives in Britain? Will there be an even greater outcry? Answers remain elusive - though a key factor will be the exact nature of the transplant involved. In the Nashes' case, it involved using cells from the new baby's umbilical cord - rather than any of its own tissue. </p> <p>'This seems an absolutely ideal use of technology for humane purposes,' says Alastair Kent, director of the Genetic Interest Group, an umbrella organisation for people suffering genetic diseases. 'It's win-win.' </p> <p>Sara Nathan, who sits on the ethics committee of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, also has few concerns: 'Given you are having the first set of tests, I don't find that the second set of tests is repugnant, and I would be surprised if others did. Did he need his umbilical cord by then? He'd been born!' </p> <p>But even as doctors arrive at this frontier, they find it is moving forward yet again. What if the person who needs help is not the new baby's sibling but its parents? Will people have a baby to cure themselves? Serhal is planning to carry out a similar procedure for the genetic blood disorder thalassemia, where the umbilical cord of the child could help cure the father. 'I don't see a problem,' he says. 'It is just an added bonus to having a healthy child.' </p> <p>But the ethics get even trickier if organs, not disposable umbilical cells, are sought. What if blood or bone marrow - or entire organs like kidneys - are needed to save a doomed relative? </p> <p>'Babies shouldn't principally be seen as a source of spare parts for the family,' says Kent. 'However, if that's a by-product of a baby who is wanted and loved anyway, it may not be a problem.' </p> <p>Nathan is not so sure, however. 'I have greater reservations about things that harm or hurt the child,' cautions Nathan. 'Kidneys - I would find that hard to deal with.' </p> <p>Serhal agrees. 'There is a simple line in the sand here,' he says. 'You don't have a second child if you are going to cut it or operate on it. You do have a second child if you want one and use discarded material - like an umbilical cord - to save another.' </p> <p>But in some cases, it could be acceptable to operate on the new baby, according to Kent: 'If it's an invasive procedure with very little risk, and if the chance of benefit is great, weigh the balance of harm and good, and let the thing go ahead.' </p> <p>And, of course, parents are emotionally involved. If the choice is between watching one child die of kidney disease and having another to donate a kidney, Tim Hedgley, chairman of the fertility charity Issue, knows what his choice would be: 'Parents do all they can to save their child. If the circumstances arose, parents would have to choose between two children or none. I would go for two children. Who in their right mind wouldn't?' </p> <p>As we enter this brave new world, and as the frontiers are pushed back, people's ethics are also likely to evolve. What seems shocking now may seem ethical in the future. 'If I had said to you 20 years ago I knew a consultant who wanted to rip the heart out of a dead body and put it in a living person and attach electrodes to it to restart it, you'd think I was mad,' says Hedgley. 'But now heart transplants are normal'. </p> <p>Hedgley is convinced that ethics will only be a few steps behind science: 'I think people would accept the harvesting of blood products, or bone marrow products - and maybe in time they could live with kidneys.' </p> <p>Intriguingly, new laws may soon force the ethicist to keep pace with the scientist. After all, it was the Human Rights Act that the Mastertons invoked to get the HFEA to break its ban on choosing the sex of their next child. </p> <p>Jonathan Montgomery, healthcare lawyer at the University of Southampton, says the Mastertons have a strong case - and the Human Rights Act could be used to break other bans, such as on choosing the appearance of babies. </p> <p>'With the Human Rights Act, the boot is on the other foot - the HFEA would have to prove its right to infringe on people's choice and articulate quite precisely why it thinks it's bad. It would have to justify why it was interfering in terms of public health or morals,' he says. </p> <p>Serhal says that, even if Britain keeps the ban on sex selection, it will become routine.'I have already helped four families get such operations in Brazil. It cost them \u00a34,000 each, plus air fares. It's not bank-breaking and it is bound to get cheaper'. </p> <p>It is also certain that the range of diseases being tested for is likely to expand rapidly. Tests for Down's syndrome, Huntington's disease, breast cancer and Alzheimer's are also being considered. The HFEA now has to ask itself whether doctors should be allowed to test for 'late onset disorders' that may not affect people till their fifties or later. </p> <p>The proliferation of genetic tests raises an even braver - or more disturbing - prospect. As IVF gets easier, fertile parents without family histories of genetic disease may want to prediagnose their embryos. </p> <p>As it become more commonplace and accepted, it could become routine for 'responsible parents' to ensure their planned children are genetically healthy, just as it is routine now to test newborn babies for certain conditions. </p> <p>Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and polio have been virtually wiped out in developed countries by vaccinations. Widespread genetic testing might do the same to genetic diseases. </p> <p>The HFEA's Nathan is sceptical: 'I don't see a day when women routinely screen for genetic disorders'. </p> <p>Kent disagrees: 'I wouldn't have a problem with widespread testing, as long as it isn't done with coercion.' </p> <p>In such a future, thousands of others would join the Millers in being given the chance to put an end to afflictions that have dogged their families for generations. </p> <p>For them, that truly would be a Brave New World. </p> <p> <strong>Brave new world of testing</strong></p> <p>Embryos are already screened for: </p> <p> \u0095 cystic fibrosis; </p> <p> \u0095 muscular dystrophy; </p> <p> \u0095 spinal muscular atrophy; </p> <p> \u0095 gender, but only for genetic disorders that affect a single sex. </p> <p><strong> Embryos are likely soon to be tested for:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 some bowel cancers; </p> <p> \u0095 early onset breast cancers; </p> <p> \u0095 Down's syndrome; </p> <p> \u0095 the blood disorder thalassemia; </p> <p> \u0095 familial Alzheimer's; </p> <p> \u0095 compatibility with family members so their umbilical cord can be used for transplant material. </p> <p><strong> In the future they could be selected for:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 gender, to balance families; </p> <p> \u0095 compatibility, so that their blood can be used for transfusion within the family; </p> <p> \u0095 compatibility so that other tissue such as bone marrow and kidneys can be transplanted; </p> <p> \u0095 appearance, as parents demand the right to have the baby of their choice without state interference. </p> <p>Useful Links:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Authority</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bioethics.gov\" target=\"_NEW\">US National Bioethics Advisory Commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.issue.co.uk/dinet\" target=\"_NEW\">IVF and DI parents' network</a></p>",
  "The loathed playboy son of ousted Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was reported to have flown to Moscow with his family yesterday amid mounting anger over his father's resolve to remain politically active. <p>As President Vojislav Kostunica, 56, was being sworn in in Belgrade, fears grew about the continuing influence of his predecessor. Britain led an operation to block access to secret family bank accounts. </p> <p>Marko Milosevic, 26, his wife Zorica and son Marko Jr were seen boarding Yugoslav Airlines Flight JU132 to the Russian capital from Belgrade early yesterday morning, according to the Yugoslav news agency Beta. Marko was the most detested member of the family because of alleged links to criminal gangs and his corrupt route to riches. </p> <p>The swearing in of Kostunica, the formal recognition that he now is running the country, was delayed for several hours yesterday by a political row over whether MPs representing Milosevic's Socialist Party in Kosovo seats should be allowed to sit in the new assembly. The greatest election fraud perpetuated by Milosevic is thought to have happened in Kosovo, leading to arguments that the MPs did not have a mandate to sit in the assembly. </p> <p>One of the first issues with which Kostunica will have to grapple is an ultimatum from Montenegro - Serbia's smaller sister republic in the Yugoslav Federation - that it will withdraw from the federation unless Kostunica withdraws troops from its territory within days. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, spoke to Kostunica. Cook said later he was greatly reassured that Yugoslavia was headed for a more stable future. The European Union will meet tomorrow to discuss scrapping sanctions. </p> <p>In Serbia, furious opposition leaders see Milosevic's declaration as a signal that he will try to obstruct Kostunica. The ex-President's supporters and his party control the key institutions in Serbia and can use these to sabotage the new leader. Kostunica has power over the army, and he was expected to sack the Defence Minister and Chief of Staff - Milosevic loyalists - within hours of inauguration. </p> <p>But the police come under Serbian control and Milosevic's network, dubbed the 'octopus' by the opposition, remains in place. A source yesterday expressed fears about the role of the state security police, the DB, which has been accused of hiding documents that could have led to criminal charges against Milosevic's cronies, his family and the former President. </p> <p>Kostunica would love to oust Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, another Milosevic crony who, like Milosovic, has been indicted for war-crimes. But Milutinovic's mandate lasts until next summer, as does that of the Serbian Parliament. </p> <p>A key figure is Bojislav Seselj, the ultra-right wing leader of the Radical party and now a crucial power-broker. If he uses his vote in the Serbian Parliament to provoke an election, he could bring down the government. </p> <p>There are unconfirmed reports that Seselj met Milosevic last Wednesday evening, the day before Milosevic was toppled. Opposition leaders suspect Milosevic is up to his old tricks of buying allies to obstruct democratic change. </p> <p>Opposition anxieties were increased by the murder yesterday of Vladimir Vokam, a close business associate of Marko Milosevic. </p> <p>Diplomats now believe Milosevic will attempt to settle in Libya or Iraq if he is forced out of Serbia. </p> <p>Additional reporting by Rory Carroll and Kamal Ahmed</p>",
  "<p>Irvine Welsh, Nick Hornby, Helen Fielding... Nick Duerden? In the past few years, a huge number of novelists have woken up, bewildered, to the news that their work has been chosen for big screen treatment. Perhaps I could join them. </p> <p>Last month, my novel Sidewalking - about a young man who comes into a lot of dirty money with calamitous consequences - came out to a handful of decent reviews, and several suggestions regarding its cinematic possibilities. Like the naive fool I am, I wasted no time in having my inside leg measured for the tuxedo I'd wear to the premiere. </p> <p>'It goes in cycles,' says Rocket Pictures's Steve Hamilton-Shaw, whose Disney affiliated company (owned by Elton John) is about to start adapting A L Kennedy's So I Am Glad. </p> <p>'In the last few years, there have been a lot of high-profile successes, adaptations like Trainspotting and High Fidelity. Inevitably, this starts some kind of trend, and so lots of novels are being snapped up, often even before being published. It's certainly a primary source of inspiration for film-makers, especially British ones.' </p> <p>In America, he explains, writers can often make a very good living churning out film scripts purely on spec, then hawking them around Hollywood with a good chance of getting a development deal. This doesn't tend to happen over here, and so the industry inevitably looks instead towards that most primary area of storytelling: books. </p> <p>'If a book sells well,' says FilmFour's Jim Wilson, currently adapting both Sebastian Faulks's Charlotte Gray and Giles Fodon's The Last King Of Scotland, 'then it has a ready-made audience, which is naturally appealing for us. Everyone who read The Beach, for example, went to see the film. I think the profile alone of Bridget Jones will keep this trend in place for some time.' </p> <p>Despite the fact that it's not released in cinemas for the better part of a year, hype for the film version of Helen Fielding's The Diary Of Bridget Jones is already colossal. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger may well have recently appeared in Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty and the Farrelly Brothers' Me, Myself &amp; Irene, but the only questions British journalists wish to pose to her concern the fictional character she is about to bring to 70mm life. </p> <p>Bridget isn't alone. Louis de Berni\u00e8res's million-selling Captain Corelli's Mandolin, starring Nicolas Cage, is also on its way amid a never-ending pre-release fanfare, as of course is J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Everything is attracting cinematic interest: in recent months, Kevin Sampson's football hooligan novel Awaydays, Colin Butts's lurid account of holiday reps in Ibiza, Is Harry On The Boat?, and Harland Miller's nostalgic tale about a David Bowie obsessive, Slow Down Arthur, Stick To Thirty, have all been snapped up.</p> <p>'Basically, we are always on the lookout for good stories,' says Wilson. 'And ideally, we're looking for something that really sticks out and marks it as a true original.' He swings around in his office chair and points to a poster of the new FilmFour-funded Lars Von Trier film, Dancer In The Dark. 'And often, I must say, that's not particularly easy. Look at something like Being John Malkovich (by US screenwriter Charlie Kaufman). I very much doubt screenplays with that kind of scope and depth exist in this country. And if they do, I haven't seen them. The UK has always been far stronger in its original fiction than screenwriting, which is why we do scour for new talent in books. But every time I read what I consider to be an excellent novel, I wish with all my heart it was already in screenplay form, because, believe me, that's when the hard work begins.' </p> <p>Which brings us to the cloud behind the silver lining - my own book's adaptation possibilities. During my research, I learnt a sobering statistic: 97 per cent of all books optioned within the UK will never make it to the screen. With mathematics like these, England are far more likely to win the World Cup than Sidewalking is to reach Leicester Square. My 32in inside leg would have to wait. </p> <p>One author who seems to have a good strike rate is Colin Bateman, the former Belfast newspaper man-turned-best-selling author and, subsequently, screenwriter, whose credits include Divorcing Jack and Cycle Of Violence. But even he concedes it's a colossal struggle. </p> <p>'It's essential to have someone who understands your work and will fight off people who try to dilute it,' he says. 'You have to realise that, at least as far as the UK is concerned, 90 per cent of the people who express an interest in turning your book into a film won't have money of their own. Generally, they will go to a large company for development money, then, when the script is written, they go looking for other companies to invest, and there can be half a dozen of those, so you end up working and re-writing to the whims of what is essentially a committee.' </p> <p> Divorcing Jack (for which he wrote the screenplay) was savaged by the critics and didn't, consequently, find the home-grown success it deserved, while Cycle Of Violence (re-titled Crossmaheart) failed to find distribution and went straight to video. His third, Empire State, which he sold for no money at all to a small British company, has already gone through three directors before a single frame has been shot. And Bateman is a success story? This is not reassuring. </p> <p>This next one, however, may be. This year, Harland Miller - a 36-year-old east London-based artist and peer of Jay Joplin and Sam Taylor Wood - published Slow Down Arthur, Stick To Thirty, his debut novel, for a reported \u00a3150,000. Agents flew in from Hollywood for several tense pow-wows. The film rights eventually went to Danny Boyle and Andrew MacDonald's production company, DNA, and it was reported that Jarvis Cocker, Miller's long-time friend, was down to direct, with Jude Law desperate for the lead role. Bingo. </p> <p>Six months on, however, and Miller has yet to pop the champagne cork. 'There was a lot of hype initially,' he says, hesitantly, 'which was good, if a little misleading. To be honest with you, I think the book is currently sitting in a drawer right now, gathering dust.' </p> <p>Given DNA's schedule - they are working on a couple of films back-to-back, as well as developing a TV series - Miller's novel isn't due to go into production until some time next year. All being well, of course. Whether Law will take the title role is now no longer certain, and the Pulp frontman has yet to sign on. </p> <p>'Books often stall along the way for a number of reasons,' explains Hamilton-Shaw. So what chance, I ask, does Sidewalking have? 'As good a chance as any, really. I do think that it does have potential to be developed as a small British independent film, so you never know.' </p> <p>FilmFour's Jim Wilson is also cautiously optimistic. 'Essentially, it treads very familiar ground, and gangland London has been done to death, but you tried to subvert it, which is clever because what do you do when you're working in a very well-established genre? You subvert it. Your character is an outsider to the whole scene, and so it is viewed from the outside. I think, as a book, it works very well. But to develop this into a film, I think you would have to work on the parody elements a bit more. But, yes, I'd say it has potential.' </p> <p>Good news? Possibly... </p> <p>A couple of weeks later, the telephone rings. It's my film agent: a couple of, yes, small independent production companies have expressed interest in the rights to Sidewalking. The money both are talking means that I'd have to hire the tuxedo rather than buy it, but both sound eager, interested and, most important of all, committed to the project. Negotiations are continuing, and excitement mounts in small increments. </p> <p>Within a matter of months, a screenplay of my book may well be sitting, much like Harland Miller's and countless others, in a drawer gathering dust, hoping not to be part of the 97 per cent that never see the light of day. </p> <p>Cautiously, my heart pounds against my ribcage, but it would be foolish to hold my breath. </p> <p><strong>Recently 'optioned' but will they make it onto the screen?</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Richards<br></strong> Throwing the House Out Of the Window <br> (optioned 1996) </p> <p><strong>James Hawes <br></strong> A White Merc With Fins<br> (optioned 1996)</p> <p><strong>William Sutcliffe <br></strong> Are You Experienced?<br> (optioned 1997)</p> <p><strong>Toby Litt<br></strong> Beatniks<br> (optioned 1997)</p> <p><strong>Meera Syal<br></strong> Anita And Me<br> (optioned 1997)</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Coe<br></strong> The House Of Sleep<br> (optioned 1997)</p> <p><strong>Emma Forrest<br></strong> Namedropper<br> (optioned 1998)</p> <p><strong>Lisa Jewel<br></strong> Ralph's Party<br> (optioned 1999)</p> <p><strong>Matt Thorne<br></strong> Eight Minutes Idle<br> (optioned 1999)</p> <p><strong>Stuart David <br></strong> Nalda Said <br>(optioned 1999)</p> <p>\u0095 Sidewalking is published by Flame at \u00a36.99</p>",
  "So call me a liar. I was standing in front of the New York Hilton Hotel when the limousine carrying International Monetary Fund director Horst Kohler zoomed by, hitting a bump. Out flew a confidential report, Ecuador Interim Country Assistance Strategy. You suspect that's not how I got it, but you can trust me that it contains the answer to a puzzling question. <p> Inside the Hilton, Professor Anthony Giddens told an earnest crowd of London School of Economics alumni that 'globalisation is a fact, and it is driven by the communications revolution'.</p> <p> Wow. That was an eye-opener. The screeching green-haired freaks outside the hotel demonstrating against the IMF had it all wrong.</p> <p>Globalisation, Giddens seems to say, is about giving every villager in the Andes a Nokia internet-enabled mobile phone. What puzzled me is why anyone would protest against this happy future.</p> <p> So I thumbed through my purloined IMF Strategy for Ecuador seeking a chapter on connecting the country's schools to the world wide web. Instead, I found a secret schedule. By 1 November this year, it says, its government is ordered to raise the price of cooking gas by 80 per cent. It must eliminate 26,000 jobs and halve real wages for the remaining workers by 50 per cent in four steps in months specified by the IMF. It must begin to transfer ownership of its biggest water system to foreign operators by July and grant BP's Arco subsidiary the right to build and own an oil pipeline over the Andes.</p> <p> That's for starters. In all, the IMF's 167 loan conditions look less like an assistance plan and more like a blueprint for a financial coup d'etat.</p> <p> The IMF would say it has no choice. Ecuador is broke, thanks to the implosion of its commercial banks. But how did Ecuador, an Opec member with resources to spare, end up in such a pickle?</p> <p>For that, we have to turn back to 1983, when the IMF forced its government to take over the soured private debts owed by Ecuador's elite to foreign banks. For this bail-out of US and local financiers, Ecuador borrowed $1.5 billion.</p> <p> To repay this loan, the IMF dictated price hikes for electricity and other necessities. And when that didn't drain off enough cash, yet another assistance plan required the state to eliminate 120,000 jobs.</p> <p> Furthermore, while trying to meet the mountain of IMF obligations, Ecuador foolishly 'liberalised' its tiny financial market, cutting local banks loose from government controls and letting private debt and interest rates explode.</p> <p>Who pushed Ecuador into this nutty romp with free-market banking? Hint: the initials are IMF. It made bank liberalisation a condition of another berserk assistance plan. The facts of this nasty little history come from the IMF report marked: 'Please do not cite.' Pretend I didn't.</p> <p> The IMF and the World Bank have lent a sticky helping hand to scores of nations. Take Tanzania. Today, 1.4 million people there are getting ready to die. They are the 8 per cent of the nation's population who have the Aids virus. The financial 'rescuers' found a brilliant neo-liberal solution: require Tanzania to charge for hospital visits, previously free. This cut the number of patients treated in the three big public hospitals in the capital, Dar es Salaam, by 53 per cent. The financial cures must be working.</p> <p>The bodies told Tanzania to charge school fees. Now the bank expresses surprise that school enrolment is down from 80 per cent to 66 per cent.</p> <p>Altogether the Bank and IMF have 157 other helpful suggestions for Tanzania, and the Tanzanian government secretly agreed last April to adopt them all. It was sign or starve. No developing nation can borrow hard currency without IMF blessing (except China, whose output grows at 5 per cent a year thanks to it studiously following the reverse of IMF policies).</p> <p> The IMF and World Bank have effectively controlled Tanzania's economy since 1985. Admittedly, when they took charge they found a socialist nation mired in poverty, disease and debt.</p> <p> Their experts wasted no time in cutting trade barriers, limiting government subsidies and selling off state industries. This worked wonders. According to bank-watcher Nancy Alexander of the Washington-based Globalisation Challenge Initiative, in just 15 years Tanzania's GDP has dropped from $309 to $210 per capita, the literacy rate is falling and the rate of abject poverty has jumped to 51 per cent of the population.</p> <p> Yet somehow the bank has failed to win over the hearts and minds of Tanzanians to its free-market gameplan. Last June, the bank reported in frustration: 'One legacy of socialism is that most people continue to believe the state has a fundamental role in promoting development and providing social services.'</p> <p> The World Bank and the IMF were born in 1944 with simple, laudable mandates: between them to fund post-war reconstruction and development projects and lend hard currency to nations left skint by temporary balance of payments deficits.</p> <p> But in 1980 they seemed to take on an alien form. In the early Eighties, Third World nations, haemorrhaging after the fivefold increases in oil prices and a similar jump in dollar interest payments, brought their begging bowls to the two bodies. But instead of debt relief, they received structural assistance plans listing an average of 114 'conditionalities' in return for capital.</p> <p> The particulars varied from nation to nation, but in every case, they had to remove trade barriers, sell national assets to foreign investors, slash social spending and make labour 'flexible' (that is, crush unions).</p> <p> Some say the vicious policy change resulted from the election that year of Ronald Reagan as US President, the quickening of Margaret Thatcher's powers and the beginning of the neo-liberal ascendency. (My own information is that the IMF and World Bank were taken over by a space alien named Larry. It's obvious that 'Larry' Summers, once World Bank chief economist and now US Treasury Secretary, is really a platoon of extra- terrestrials sent to turn much of the human race into a source of cheap protein. But I digress.)</p> <p> So what have The Aliens accomplished with their e free-market prescriptions? An article by Samuel Brittan in last week's Financial Times declared that the new world capital markets and free trade have 'brought about an unprecedented increase in world living standards'. Brittan cites the huge growth in GDP per capita, life expectancy and literacy in the less developed world from 1950 to 1995.</p> <p> Now hold on a minute. Until 1980, virtually every nation in his survey was either socialist or welfare statist. They were developing on the 'Import Substitution Model', by which locally-owned industry was built through government investment and high tariffs, anathema to the neoliberals.</p> <p> In those dark ages of increasing national government control and ownership (1960-1980), per capita income grew by 73 per cent in Latin America and by 34 per cent in Africa. By comparison, since 1980, Latin American growth has come to a virtual halt, growing by less than 6 per cent over 20 years - and African incomes have declined by 23 per cent.</p> <p> Now let's count the corpses. From 1950 to 1980, socialist and statist welfare policies added more than a decade of life expectancy to virtually every nation on the planet. From 1980 to today, life under structural assistance has become brutish and shorter. Since 1985, the total number of illiterate people has risen and life expectancy is falling in 15 African nations. Brittan attributes this to 'bad luck, [not] the international economic system'. In the former Soviet states, where IMF and World Bank shock plans hold sway, life expectancy has plunged, adding 1.4 million a year to the death rate in Russia alone.</p> <p> Admittedly, the World Bank and IMF are reforming. The dreaded structural assistance plans have been renamed 'poverty reduction strategies'. Doesn't that make you feel better?</p> <p> Recently, the IMF admitted that 'in the recent decades, nearly one-fifth of the world population have regressed' - arguably 'one of the greatest economic failures of the twentieth century.' And that, Professor Giddens, is a fact.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\"> gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When the camera is trained on him, he goes immediately, automatically, into that famous and familiar moody, brooding look. You wonder if Sir Alex Ferguson has it right when he talks about the fun-loving boy having become an introverted young man, or whether it is just a professional pose that Manchester United and England's golden vision has picked up from his wife Victoria. </p> <p>After all, a similar attitude to the lens has proved marketable and profitable for her in another branch of showbiz. Either way, David Beckham is yer average snapper's dream, a top photographer's challenge. Because of his good looks and natural relationship with a camera, it is as easy to get a cracking shot out of Beckham as it is for United to get one from a free kick 25 yards out. Because he has been changed by painful experience of these eagle-eyed, green-eyed times - where the price of talent and fame is death threats, an attempt to snatch his son and a stalker - that guarded, sullen, photogenic look is both non-committal mask and a way of telling people he doesn't yet know or trust not to come too close.</p> <p>It could be that which Ferguson has sought to understand and explain. But it is not the essence of Beckham and the challenge is to find the hidden reality. It emerges when you spend some time with the man who is a supposedly shallow media face but a substantial figure on the football field. It is to hear and glimpse the unexpected. </p> <p>To the people who believe life is an intellectual exercise, rather than an emotional journey, Beckham appears to be a dumbbell. For a man whose eloquence and intelligence is best with a ball at his feet, he doesn't do half bad in revealing some unsuspected feelings and thoughts, however. 'Absolutely,' he says when you ask him if he agrees that those who have it all are not allowed to have down days. And he admits to having them, admits to having the potential to 'crack up' over remarks about his wife and son. </p> <p>In private, this is not the man whose public image is supposed to echo Dorothy Parker's comment about the actor who 'ran the gamut of emotions from A to B'. You ask him something routine, for example, about the recent goalless draw in Kiev. 'It's always hard going over to places like that,' he begins to reply and you anticipate him saying something like it being because Eastern European teams are so well-organised, but then he adds 'and you see the poverty over there and then come back to your life.' </p> <p>He pauses and looks pensive for a moment before expanding. 'When we were coming back from training the main streets were pitch black. There was, like, a little lamp on each street corner. It was hard to sign autographs over there because the people were so, sort of, intense, but I did the best I could, signing as many as I could because that, and I'm not sounding big-headed, but that to someone, stopping and signing autographs, means a lot. You look at these people and realise how lucky you are.'</p> <p>The first unexpected aspect to Beckham had come an hour earlier. We were sat, the photographer, one of Beckham's agents and I, at a pavement caf* in the well-heeled Cheshire village that is his northern base. With the stealth that disarms full-backs, he suddenly appeared from nowhere, having noticed us on his way home from training and pulled up his silver BMW, one of the fleet of cars he so loves driving, especially at 2am for 'the freedom of the road'. </p> <p>When introduced, he smiles, offers a hand and fixes you with an eye contact surprisingly prolonged and confident for one said to be so shy. His flat surprises, too. No sign of the stereotypical footballer's World of Leather interior here. The wide halls are lined with favourite framed photos from matches and intimate pictures of the Spice Girls, like Mel C on stage in a Brazil shirt and Mel B plucking the eyebrows of her now estranged husband Jimmy Gulzar. </p> <p>There is also a copy of that tableau painting by Michael Browne, The Art of the Game, autographed by the subjects, which features Eric Cantona in imperial Roman pose with his young team-mates, including Beckham, at his feet and Ferguson at his head. In the kitchen, there look to be at least 100 greetings cards urging Victoria - at home with her parents today recovering from viral meningitis - to get well. Behind a door with a silver star on it inscribed 'Brooklyn's Room,' their son naps under wall paintings of cartoon characters. </p> <p>Beckham himself likes to relax by drawing Disney characters but he wanted someone better for the murals, he says. We settle in the tasteful lounge, in two of the three deep, cream fabric sofas set around a thakat table and the widest of widescreen televisions. It does not dominate the room, though. Nor does a touching photo of Victoria and him in embrace. That falls to a 3ft-high Buddha. Only Brooklyn's toys, which include a mini sit-in sports car, disturb the ambience here, as does a bag of Pampers back down the corridor. </p> <p>You can bet Beckham knows that Feng Shui is not the name of some Japanese full-back he may encounter in the next World Cup finals. It's funny. You think you know everything there is to know about Beckham because he seems to be such public property these days and you wonder what new questions you can ask him. You soon realise how much time you would need to get a full picture. </p> <p>He has a new book out, My World, and it contains some fascinating insights, both verbal and pictorial. It is, it should be said, a quick response to the prospective publication of an unauthorised book which was contested in the courts by Beckham and his wife, by Andrew Morton, formerly the controversial chronicler of Diana, Princess of Wales. In retaliation, Beckham has clearly been advised to launch a charm offensive, of which a television appearance with Michael Parkinson and quite probably this interview are parts.</p> <p>There is more in his book than I thought there would be, I tell him. 'A lot more than I wanted there to be,' Beckham says, and that dilemma between wanting to open up and fearing the consequences surfaces. It courses through his conversation. Yes, Manchester United would beat England, he says instantly, before adding 'No. I don't know. I can't really answer that.' You find out that he has been, he admits, inches and seconds away from thumping an abusive member of a crowd and that he understands 'totally' what Cantona did five years ago when he leapt feet first at a fan. He quickly has to add the politically correct rider that what Eric did was wrong. </p> <p>You find out, too, that he wears a new pair of custom-made boots for almost every game, unlike most professionals who prefer a worn old pair, because he likes to look smart and feel good. That makes around 300 pairs so far around this mid-point of the 25-year-old's career. He keeps all the used-once pairs 'somewhere in London', he says, but is hesitant to tell you where. It takes a while for you to realise why he is so reticent, then you understand; some budding Imelda Marcos out there could well be tempted into a bit of breaking and entering. </p> <p>We start, once he has finished his chip butty with ketchup, by talking about Manchester United. It is, after all, for all the peripheral matters, the blood that courses through the veins of his varied life. With United so dominant in the Premiership in early season, the title is already as good as won, isn't it? </p> <p> 'People always say when we are playing well that we've won it already but I think to us it's never over until the last ball's kicked in the last game of the season. We play till then. If we were to believe what people say about the team and the players, we probably wouldn't be as ambitious as we are.' You wonder if it ever gets boring, winning games so comfortably, and whether this might be behind some uncharacteristic recent squandering of comfortable leads. </p> <p>'It never, ever gets boring,' he says. 'Against Everton, the first half was probably the most enjoyable game of football I've played in, not because we were hammering them, or winning two or three-nil, but just the way we were playing. It was such good football, such enjoyable football, the way we were passing the ball about, the times I was getting on the ball. </p> <p>'Even when I'm not involved in some of the moves, I can look at it and smile because I think how lucky I am to be in a team like this that plays this football. There is a lapse in concentration sometimes for five or 10 minutes and a team gets back into the game but I don't think we're a team that takes the mick out of teams. The respect thing is always there towards other teams because they are professional players playing their best and trying their hardest. We are taught that as we come through the ranks at United. Like we're taught that it's important not just to be playing good football at the start of a game but also at the end of the season.' </p> <p>Never was that better seen than in United's Treble year, when they won the European Cup with the last two kicks of the campaign. Is this team even better? 'I wouldn't say we were better but we are a more experienced team. I think we have learnt from our experiences of playing in Europe and winning the Premier League. We go into Europe and know what to expect from these teams most of the time.' Like the routine goalless draw in Kiev? 'That's the good thing about it.'</p> <p> The 3-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven intruded as motivation anew. It is remarkable, love them or hate them, that United retain the same thirst for trophies season after season, just when you think they may have peaked. </p> <p>'I don't think I'm at my peak yet and I don't think this team is at its peak yet,' says Beckham. 'Because most of us are still young, still 25 and 26, we've still got a lot to learn from the game. There are still a lot of trophies to be won. We are not getting ahead of ourselves and we're not being big-headed.' </p> <p>Remarkable, too, that United maintain an astonishing appetite for work during games, the factor which distinguishes them from rivals who may have as much talent. 'That's the good thing about our team,' he says. 'You don't get players hiding during a game. Players work hard not just for themselves but for the team. If you look around the team, every player works for each other. If one player goes forward, another will step in. </p> <p>'That was the work ethic we have had pumped into us since we were apprentices. Me, Gary, Phil, Scholesy, Butty, Giggsy, we were brought up to work hard at our game and we knew the rewards in front of us if we did. We had to go back in the afternoons and some of us went back in the evenings to work with the kids who were coming up when we were apprentices.' </p> <p>Now in the afternoons, Beckham will sometimes go back and practise free-kicks with bare feet, to improve his feel for the ball. 'It's something I have always done,' he says, and no, it doesn't bruise or damage his feet. 'I did have bad toenails and a fungal infection in all my toes around the World Cup but I got put on tablets for six months and that cleared it up.' Was it true that the youth team coach Eric Harrison's motto to the apprentices was to play the game and not the occasion? </p> <p>'Yeah. It was the best thing to say to us really. Because when you are at a team like Man United you can step on to the pitch and look around and think, \"Oh my God, what am I doing here?\"' Has he ever felt that? 'Never. Sometimes I look around and think, \"Jesus, I am a lucky person.\"' It echoes what Sir Alex, who often speaks of what makes a Manchester United player, once said of Eric Cantona; that he walked into Old Trafford and stuck out his chest as if to ask if the club was big enough for him. </p> <p>'You have got to have a certain amount of arrogance to play at Man United, whether people like it or not,' adds Beckham. 'It is such a big club with so many expectations of you as a player. If you look through the United teams over the last 10 years, they have had players who have got the arrogance and the determination to win. That's pumped into us even at a young age. We have all got the aggression. It's been proved a number of times. We all stick together and that's the important thing.' </p> <p>The criticism arising from their attitude, you put to him, is that United are ungracious in victory, let alone defeat. 'We are ungracious in the extent of we just hate, despise losing. It's not like we won't shake players' hands. We are not that sort of team. We'll accept it if we've been beaten but we hate it. That's what makes us the players and the team we are. People always sing \"we hate Man United\" but you always get them asking for your autograph afterwards.'</p> <p>The affinity for United, the club given to him by his dad Ted, is deep. Has he never thought of leaving, not even when dropped last season for the match against Leeds after an argument with the manager over him missing training to look after Brooklyn? 'Never,' he replies, quick as a flash. 'There was something in the papers that weekend that this could be it but I never even thought about it. </p> <p>'I was on international duty that week and me and Gary [ Neville, his best friend and best man at his wedding] just talked about what had happened. We decided the best thing I could do was get my head down, get it sorted and get playing again.' There was a suggestion that Neville had told him to cut out the showbiz lifestyle. 'No,' adds Beckham. 'Gary would never say that. I might be pictured at a party or be in the papers but he knows that even though my wife's in the pop life, I am level-headed and concentrating on my football.' </p> <p>You suggest that what he is going through, with all the public scrutiny, resembles George Best in the Sixties, when United didn't understand the phenomenon of stardom. 'I still don't think they do,' he mutters. Beckham is clearly a different personality from Best, however. He cites his favourite night in as a video and Chinese takeaway with Victoria, and night out a meal in a restaurant with her. Perhaps it is even worse these days, with all the media outlets. 'Most of the stuff that goes into the papers is a load of crap,' he says. 'There was a story saying Walkers wanted to bring out Smoky Beckham crisps and I was supposed to be going to court and taking proceedings because I didn't know anything about it. I was asked about a year ago but I didn't think it was right for me. </p> <p>'People believe stories about me spending \u00a31,200 on a pair of jeans and they think, \"He's big' or whatever.' Then he laughs. 'I buy a lot of clothes and I do spend most of my money on clothes but unless I really liked them I wouldn't buy them. And I didn't like them.' The story about the new boots for every game, told to me by an England player, is true. 'I like the look of new boots and I feel good in new boots,' he says, agreeing that he has a need to feel clean and smart all the time. He breaks the routine only if he has done especially well in one pair, or scored a particularly good goal, in which case he will wear them again. </p> <p>'I used to give some of the old ones with \"Becks\" on the tongue away to charity or back to adidas but since I had \"Brooklyn\" on the tongue I don't give none of them away any more. 'We get phoned up about stories every day. Some you just laugh at and others are hurtful, saying things that are so not true. There was a story saying me and Victoria were arguing because she was spending so much time doing her new single. Which is a load of crap. [The story, not the single, you should explain on his behalf.] I don't know whether they are trying to get to us or make people not like us but it's things like that that upset us.'</p> <p>Actually, the two are probably well aware that doting celebrity couples may be interesting to the well-paying glam mags but are less exciting to the mass market red-top papers who know that rifts sell better. Along with controversy. 'People say, \"Oh he's going off the rails, he's down in London, or living in London,\"' adds Beckham. 'I've never lived in London while I've been with Man United. People like to stir things up and make the manager believe things.' So does the legendarily watchful Ferguson phone him to see what he is up to? </p> <p>'He's done it once but I think he rings other people around me. There was one occasion about two months after the Leeds game. It was said I was flying here, there and everywhere, to Italy, to Spain, and he rang me up one afternoon when I was going for a sauna in Manchester. He said, \"Where the eff are you?\" I said, \"In the car.\" He went, \"Oh right. I've just had a call saying someone's sat next to you in Barcelona airport.\" I think he gets calls all the time about me. Some of them he doesn't believe and some of them he's got to check out because they could be true.' </p> <p>It is a, shall we say, interesting relationship with the manager. 'Beyond whatever has gone on between me and the manager or whatever's been in the papers,' he replies, 'I think there will always be that respect from me to him and hopefully him to me.' Is it true that the players privately call him Taggart, after the dour Scottish TV detective? 'I don't. I don't think so. They wouldn't get away with it.' And did Beckham have that shaved haircut to avoid the notorious 'hairdryer' treatment, when Ferguson stands in a player's face to berate him? He smiles. 'I've had it a few times. I had it with Eric Harrison in the youth team.'</p> <p>Beckham no longer keeps it secret that he would prefer to play in the centre of United's midfield, as he did for England last month against France. 'I look at players like Zidane and they are playing in the middle and getting more involved in the game than I am on the right,' he says. 'That's the position I want to play and in years to come hopefully I will. It's just something I want to do and have always wanted to do. But it won't be until the manager gets another right winger, I don't think. He has said in the past that I could if he finds a player who can cross the ball as well as I do. But you never know. He might just get rid of me if he gets another right winger.' </p> <p>Is it therefore possible that he might have to leave Manchester United to fulfil that ambition, to overtake Rivaldo, to whom he finished runner-up last year as World Player of the Year? 'Not really. Even though I want to play in the middle, I am still playing quite good football on the right. At the end of the day, if I am happy in my life and my football at Man United, then I won't make any changes in it. It's up to me and my family, up to me if I am happy football-wise. And I am happy. I've had the offers, you see things in the papers about Barcelona and Milan and Madrid and you think about it, but if I am happy I don't see why I should move anywhere else.' </p> <p>It might be difficult, you suggest, to find such a well-oiled team into which he would slip so easily. 'That's the thing that makes my football enjoyable. I have grown up with these players, we know each other's strengths and weaknesses and we gel. People can always have their opinions, like to become a great player you have got to play in Italy or Spain, but happiness is more important. It's my decision. People will say, \"Oh it's Victoria who's making the decisions.\" It will never be Victoria who will take me away from Manchester United.' And the suggestions that he is under her thumb? 'I'm not even bothered,' he says. 'People can think what they like. I know the truth.' </p> <p>You venture that it's a nice thumb to be under. 'Course it is. It could be a horrible, nasty thumb but it's a very beautiful thumb. People are always going to stir things up between me and Victoria. They say she's the boss but we know the truth.' </p> <p>Might it be the abuse he has endured, notably after the sending-off against Argentina in France '98, that could ultimately drive him away? It seems not. 'I had a lot go on after the World Cup. Victoria was away on tour and I was in the house, the old house in north Manchester, on my own. I used to go driving at two in the morning a lot because I couldn't sleep. I was missing her and I don't need that much sleep anyway [though he also admits, when he does nod off, to being able to sleep through the loudest of alarms]. I like it at that time of the morning and I do like driving. You have just got the freedom of the road. I don't do it so much now because I can sleep now I am a father. </p> <p>'But all that stuff definitely made me stronger as a person. Made me change the way I thought about things and people. A lot of good came out, not that I want it to happen again but looking back, it was good for me in a weird way. I was glad it did. If that hadn't happened, something else would over the next couple of years.' Here, that steely side of his personality appears, as you ask him about certain critics' reaction to the Argentina red card. He repeats the remarks of the new book, which stick out amid all the generally good-natured text, just as his self-destructive periodic spits of temper on the field punctuate his largely creative game. </p> <p>'I'll get them back one day, a lot of people who said things about me on TV and in the papers, a mixture of people,' he says calmly. 'I couldn't name names at this point in time but in my own way maybe I won't get them back but I'll always remember that. I don't hold grudges but if someone has said something nasty about me and my family, then I remember it.' You suggest that putting them in a wall 10 yards away from a free-kick of his might be satisfying. 'That would be nice,' he replies. </p> <p> And the stalker? 'That was six or seven months ago. She just used to come up to the front door. Appear. She got put in care and we've not seen her again, touch wood.' Then you curse yourself for your insensitivity in suggesting that you know you've made it when you've got your own stalker. He smiles a wide smile, as if he's heard that one in the dressing room. 'It's not nice, though,' he says. Then, what about the attempted snatching of Brooklyn outside Harrods last year?</p> <p>'It's something that happened that was a warning for us. We knew from letters we had got and things people had said that he's not going to have the most normal of lives but as parents we are trying to get him to live a normal life. It is going to be difficult to find a school but as long as we are happy with what's going on inside the school then I don't think there will be a problem. You can be paranoid to a certain extent but in the end it'll start affecting your life and we don't want that.' </p> <p>You can imagine he is actually looking forward, as a proud dad, to standing outside the school gates waiting for the bell. It is the comments about Brooklyn from the stands that get to him most. The worst elements seem to have moved on from Posh Spice's imagined sexual preferences to, disgracefully and depressingly, hoping that Beckham's son gets cancer. And he confesses to having been close to emulating Cantona's assault on a fan. </p> <p>'I totally understand it. Things happen on the pitch and things happen off the pitch. What fans shout these days is horrendous, even worse than five years ago with Eric. Eric knows he was wrong but at the end of the day, that's his way.' And when has he been tempted to react similarly? 'Most of the time it's been at Chelsea or West Ham. West Ham are bad. Southampton as well, they're one of the worst. The things they say are the worst I have ever experienced. I have even got used to stuff about Brooklyn now. I've got to. Because if I don't, then I will just crack up. </p> <p>'I just get on with it. I don't like it. It upsets me. It kills me them saying it about either of them. Victoria has always said to me, \"Just think what they are doing. They are getting their aggression out on you and going home to probably a sad life.\" She always turns round and says that if you are ever at that point, just think about what you've got and what you are doing. These people would do anything to be playing for Man United and England. I've got to think of that straightaway or I could do something.' </p> <p>He has, he says, confronted abusers. 'I have turned round sometimes to the crowd when someone's, like, shouting and I can actually hear them saying what they are saying and I look them in the face and they will just stop because they are embarrassed.' Then his sense of humour breaks through. 'Unless it's Chelsea or West Ham. Then I look away again.' </p> <p>He has sensed some change in mood, he says, since Euro 2000, during which he gestured back towards abusive fans after England's defeat by Portugal. He was, after all, one of the country's few successes of the tournament and says of the developing attitude to him: 'It stunned me in a way when I got a player of the year award from the fans [in a recent television poll]. To get that after what people sing and chant about me, that was something that meant a lot to me.'</p> <p>So has he feared playing for England? 'I don't fear it. I don't enjoy it probably as much as I could do but I enjoy it more than I used to. At the end of the day, people shouting at me would like to be out there.' Has he ever thought to himself, I don't need this? 'Never. Jimmy Greaves said in an article that players are paid all this money and not even bothered about playing for England but that's a load of crap.' </p> <p>Then there is a veiled criticism of Glenn Hoddle, once a personal hero who turned into a villain when he dropped Beckham in the World Cup. 'The atmosphere has changed now,' adds Beckham. 'Players always want to play for England but the week leading up to the game has got to be interesting and I think that's changed now. Players enjoy the week more.' </p> <p>What about the criticism of Kevin Keegan, that he may not be up to the job internationally? 'I don't think it can be done any better than it is being done by the staff and the manager. They are doing their best. They can pick the team and organise us but it's up to us to go out there and do the right things and win, which we didn't in Euro 2000. Against France, I felt that the team was so much better the way we played, more like playing for a club team because of the atmosphere between the players and the way they stuck together. </p> <p>'Because I have played so many games now for England I do feel more comfortable than I have ever felt. I love playing for England. I get a buzz stepping out in front of 90,000 fans. Some of them like you, some of them don't. But they all cheer when you score.' And then he laughs at himself. 'Or when I scored,' he adds, referring to the under-performing return of one goal, a brilliant free kick against Colombia, from his first 35 appearances. And for all the abuse, he would clearly like to be captain. You tell him that Keegan has been on the radio, saying that he would consider Beckham as captain if Tony Adams is injured. His face breaks into a broad smile. 'That's cheered me up. Interesting,' he responds.</p> <p>For all the craziness of the past few years, Beckham confesses that he will miss it when it is over. 'Of course. I know I have got things I want to do after I finish playing [skiing is one, though being anonymous enough to take Victoria and Brooklyn and future children camping may be fanciful] but I enjoy football so much it's weird not to think I will be doing it all the time. </p> <p>'I don't want to be a manager or a coach. I'd rather put myself into kids football. I will have had stress and hassle for the last 20 years so it will be a relief not to. I just like to see kids playing football and having a laugh.' He himself still gets that childish feeling of when he was a teenager and he would pass up the opportunity to drink cider on street corners with his mates because he wanted to be in watching Match of the Day then to bed in anticipation of his Sunday morning game. </p> <p>'I hate night games because of the waiting,' he says. 'I love playing in the mornings. Up early, playing early. It's a good feeling. I love playing Saturday-Wednesday, Saturday-Wednesday because at Sunday League level I used to play on a Saturday and Sunday, a Wednesday, a Friday, then Saturday and Sunday again.' </p> <p>As he has gradually opened up, it seems like a good time to ask him about all the jokes, the Becks and Posh, thick and thin, stuff. 'It's a laugh. Them sort of things are funny,' he says. 'It's different when people are slagging you off and being personal.' He hasn't seen the Alistair McGowan impression he says, but laughs politely when you tell him about it. </p> <p>Then it is time for the photographer, time for me to help keep the now-awake, toddling cutie Brooklyn (whose vocabulary seems to consist of 'mamma', 'dada' and 'foo'ball') amused by kicking about his 'Fred the Red' Manchester United ball with him. 'What shall I wear?' Beckham asks his agent. And all of a sudden the look, what the Americans call the 'game face', is back. </p> <p>\u0095 'David Beckham - My World' is published by Hodder and Stoughton at \u00a316.99.

  "<p>Until last week Antony Worrall Thompson was solely a man of food. He had nifty ways with Raspberry Fool. He could show you how to knock up a Shepherd's Pie. He believed in shop-bought custard and stock cubes. Then, last Tuesday, he turned up on the platform at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth giving William Hague the backing of his substantial celebrity - along with Jim Davidson, Mike Yarwood and Dana. Instantly, Antony Worrall Thompson became a man of politics. </p> <p>Now, as a man of politics, he must have policies. Here he is, then, on fox hunting: 'I think it's awful the way foxes are finally killed but the hunt is still the only way to get the animals out of the ground. So, once they've got them out of the ground, then they should shoot the poor things.'As definitions of caring Conservatism go, they don't get much better than that: keep fox hunting. Just make sure the fox is killed nicely. </p> <p>So how do you get the fox away from the baying hounds? He looks pensive for a moment. 'It's a difficult one, isn't it,' he says. 'You're never going to please everyone, are you?' We are sitting in the carefully tended back garden of his five-acre estate in Oxfordshire, an inherited property made beautiful on the proceeds of his various successful restaurant businesses. Around us a BBC crew are setting up the next shot for the Food and Drink show of which, for the past two series, Worrall Thompson, 49, has been main presenter and which is now recorded here at his home, hard by the Thames. He lights a cigarette - one of many - and points away towards the fields out front of the house where his three dozen chickens are penned. 'Personally I catch the foxes over there and then release them in woods 20 miles away.' But it wouldn't work if everybody did that would it, because people would come and release their foxes by your fields? He agrees. That wouldn't work either. Tricky business, this politics. No matter. He's still keen to be involved. 'I would like to be a politician some day,' he announces. What? An MP? Really? He nods. There has only just been a selection process for a new MP in his local constituency of Henley, currently occupied by Michael Heseltine who is stepping down. The local Conservative Party chose Boris Johnson, editor of the Spectator , to succeed him. 'In five years time I might have gone for it,' Worrall Thompson says, 'But Heseltine resigned too early for me. I'm not ready just yet.' </p> <p>The prospect of Antony Worrall Thompson MP seems at first absurd. He has a cosy, soft, even huggsy persona which is reflected perfectly in the kind of modern comfort food he now cooks on screen; the fishcakes and stews and roasts. He does not seem at all suited to the flinty cut and thrust of political life. Then again perhaps the world of television chefdom has provided him with the ideal training. Last month, during a interview, Delia Smith laid into Worrall Thompson. She called him 'dreadful, just repulsive' and described Food and Drink as 'the most disgusting thing on television'. He hit back, calling her 'the coldest woman on television'. </p> <p>'I also called her the Volvo of cooking which I meant as a term of endearment.' He shrugs. 'I just meant she was safe but obviously she thought I meant she was boring. But she does make lousy scrambled eggs. They're horrible and runny.' </p> <p>And what about Gordon Ramsay, who came to Delia's defence, announcing that he always gives her books to his wife as Christmas presents? 'Ramsay and I have always had a spat,' Worrall Thompson says. 'The sort of food he cooks is outmoded, outdated and not what people want any more. It's destined to sit next to the dinosaurs in the Natural History Museum.' The honourable member for Henley smiles. He may want the fox dispatched humanely but he's clearly more than happy to see Mr Gordon Ramsay ripped limb from metaphorical limb. </p> <p>For all his political ambitions the TV chef is undoubtedly happiest talking about food. Last week Tim Yeo, Shadow Agriculture Minister, announced that he would appoint him as an adviser on organic food if the Conservatives win the next election. Worrall Thompson is definitely up for the job. 'I want to get the message across that food is an important part of people's lives,' he says. 'Nobody's working out what's wrong with our food production. I mean, why in the age of more sprays and pesticides are we suffering from more allergies? Our immune systems are shot to hell and organic food can change that.' </p> <p>He practises what he preaches: as well as the chickens, he keeps pigs, two Middle Whites called Lunch and Dinner, from which he hopes to breed. He uses their manure to fertilise a large organic vegetable garden which supplies both of his London restaurants and a nearby pub that he has recently taken over. At weekends he and his wife Jay run a stall in a farmer's market at Henley selling organic chutneys and eggs. He is, in short, a big believer in the organic food movement. Unfortunately it turns out that he's not such a big believer in the Conservatives' policy on food. 'Tim Yeo said we should push ahead with GM testing in this country. Well, I'm against that. This country is too small. If we get it wrong then we've ruined nature for life and you can't go back.' </p> <p>So why give his support to the Tory party if he doesn't agree with them? 'I want to change them. I believe they can be changed.' OK, then, he doesn't see eye to eye with them on food policy. And, I suggest, while we're at it, he can't really agree with their stance on single mothers, can he? After all, now into his third marriage, he's created a few of those himself. He has two teenage sons living in Australia by one former wife, whom he supports, and another child by a previous relationship whom he does not see. (He now has two more children by Jay, Toby-Jack, five and Billie-Lara, three.) 'No,' he says, 'I don't agree with that. But then I'm not going to agree with any government on every policy, am I?' </p> <p>What about Ann Widdecombe's stance on cannabis? Have you, Mr Worrall Thompson, ever been stoned? 'No.' What, you've never smoked dope? 'Oh yeah, I've smoked dope. It just made my legs go to sleep. All right, no, I didn't agree with Widdecombe on that. Yes, we must get tough on law and order. We all want that but the police haven't got time to go chasing after every cannabis user.' </p> <p>We move on. Asylum seekers? 'The majority of the people in this country don't want us to be a dumping ground for every foreign national,' he says. 'Yes, they want the deserving ones to get in but not every chancer.' Ah, progress. That sounds like the voice of Toryism. 'But I don't agree with the idea of penning them all up in compounds.' Oh dear. And we were so close to what political pundits call consensus. </p> <p>On taxation Worrall Thompson has a whole raft of policies. He would like to see VAT raised to 21 per cent and direct taxation lowered. But at the same time he thinks that a 50 per cent tax rate on high earnings of \u00a3150,000-\u00a3200,000 might not be the worst idea in the world. These are both interesting policies in themselves, innovative policies perhaps. They just don't happen to be Conservative Party policies at the moment. Finally we find something he does agree with the Tories on: the retention of Clause 28. 'I'm an open-minded person but most of the country do not want homosexual education stuffed down their kids' throats.' He thinks William Hague is 'a great orator - he knocks spots off Blair. But I do sometimes wonder if Hague is the right leader. He does have to create an image outside the chamber. He's a brilliant politician but maybe he's not number one.' </p> <p>Still, for the moment, Hague's the man. 'More Tories have to come out of the closet,' he says. 'I reckon there are a lot out there but I think they're frightened to admit it. You've got to be brave to be in the Tory party right now.' Perhaps you have to be particularly brave if you are in the restaurant business. It is driven almost entirely by fashion and Worrall Thompson knows that. He made his name in the Eighties with a restaurant called M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois, which served only starters and puddings and caught the mood of diners who wanted to go to restaurants to see and be seen rather than to eat. (It was a favourite of Princess Diana.) In the late Eighties he moved on to restaurants like dell'Ugo, serving up an early form of fusion cooking. Now, with his London restaurant Woz, which does one set menu a day, served family style in the middle of the table, he has simplified everything just when it was becoming hip to do so. </p> <p>Is he concerned that some punters might not want to eat in his restaurants because of his unfashionable politics? He drags deeply on another unfashionable cigarette. 'I'll lose the 10 per cent who are radical, maybe, but that's not much is it?' </p> <p>Anyway, he says, he has never pursued trends. 'I'm the one who sets the fashions that others follow.' Perhaps he's right. If so, expect the Conservatives to come up with new policies on GM foods, fox hunting, asylum seekers, single mothers, taxation and drugs any day soon.</p>",
  "<p>It is a mistake to think of a path as a gap between the things that it leads to, a kind of horticultural no-man's-land. As much as anything else in the garden, it is where the action is. Analyse the paths of a garden and you learn much about the gardener. Are they straight and grid-like, or curving and meandering? Is the planting geared around the paths with flanking avenues, markers at the intersections of other paths and careful gradations of plants working down to the path's edges, or does the path become sublimated into the planting, as it often does in a vegetable patch or in wilder, softer planting schemes? </p> <p>Nothing connects a garden so clearly to the building it belongs to than the paths leading from the house. If they line up with the doors and windows, they immediately impose a symmetry and proportion dictated by the house. I think this is often highly desirable, but it can just as easily be used in reverse to free the garden from the potential restrictions of the house.</p> <p>The first law of any garden path is to get you from A to B. If it is the main route to the compost heap, herb bed or greenhouse, then it wants to be as direct as possible. </p> <p>It is an absolute rule that people will eventually work out the quickest route and use it, even if that means ignoring a beautifully made, dry path to slice diagonally across a muddy lawn or step through a flowerbed. If you don't want this, you must block off the alternatives with impenetrable planting or a more solid barrier. And it is not just humans that this applies to; our dogs, rather weirdly, leave the straight path down to the front door and do a little curving diversion on to the grass, making a worn, doggy groove in winter.</p> <p>It is always a mistake to have a path like a runway taking you down to a point that is visible throughout the whole journey. They must lead to places you cannot see without going to the very end. People who are more interested in plants than gardens tend to assume that one's eyes will be cast down to look at the plants, treating a path rather like a gangway at a flower show. This is nonsense. If you can see everything without progressing from the beginning, then the incentive to move down the path is greatly reduced - however rare the plants along the way. Either the path must curve you round and away from the goal so that you are drawn back to it or else you must take the path through at least one entrance. This might just be a gap in the hedge - the hedge might be there solely to provide the said gap - but some kind of screen there must be.</p> <p>It is not enough just to have paths looking good. They must work, if they are to be used. This is not always easy to get right. When we first moved in eight years ago, I believed that we could simply cut beds from the grass of the field, mow the bits in between and call them paths. It is not a bad policy, if you have limited funds, and half our paths are still just mown field and need only a pass with a mower once a week to keep them that way. I especially like the paths made by cutting the orchard grass at different lengths, with the mown, gently curving strip fringed by the tall meadow grasses. Dead simple, but dead lovely.</p> <p>But grass is useless in the rainy season, which, with the unstoppable roll of global warming, lasts for at least eight months of the year. And even in summer, every time you set foot on the path, let alone wheel a heavy barrow on it, you are compacting the soil down, worsening the drainage and increasing the subsequent winter quagmire.</p> <p>OK, I speak from jaundiced experience, living in one of the wettest places in England with heavy soil to boot, but even the fastest draining ground loses some of its allure after a week's rain in November. Certainly in my own garden, the lovely springy grass paths of summer are just a photo in the book. Feet can't remember them. Going outside to get a sprig of rosemary means taking off your shoes and putting on wellingtons. Only frost brings sufficient hard dryness to walk unprotected.</p> <p>So, over the years, as money and time have allowed, we have been converting our paths from grass to hard surfaces. The luxury of walking dry-shod is worth the work and expense. It also opens up a whole range of colours, textures and structure to the garden. A grass path can somehow hardly be called structural, whereas a brick path is a wall on edge. One of the features of all grand gardens is that they have yards and yards of stone or brick paths. Grand gardens tend to belong to wealthy people, who discovered long ago that if a path is to be any use for most of the year, it must be made of almost anything except grass.</p> <p>So, I have been pouring my enormous wealth into paths. Brick paths, stone paths, gravel paths and cobbled paths. My fortune is invested in paths. The first paths we made were from stone and cobbles. They were intended to be all stone but, after the first few yards, it became apparent that what seemed like a huge pile bought as a random job lot at a knock-down price was not going to do anything like the required stretch. So, we started mixing in cobbles to fill the gaps and make the stone go further. It worked very well, despite the fact that cobbles do not make good paths. They are too knobbly and slippery to walk on with ease. But if you have sufficient stone, they're fine. Cobbles are reasonably cheap to buy and we have dug up loads and used them to edge paths and as a surface barrier in areas where we don't want people to walk.</p> <p>Then we progressed to brick. Sarah had given me the bricks for a path for my 40th birthday. She hunted for ages until she found second-hand bricks from the same brickyard (small, local, closed down in 1884) as those at the back of the house from where the path leads. Choosing bricks that relate to those of the house or any existing walls is the most important aspect of any brick path. It is laid basket-weave fashion and I love it, although the shadiest bit gets incredibly slippery.</p> <p>We then made what I think is our best path. It is very narrow, curves through the spring garden and is made entirely from all the leftover bits and pieces of the first phase of building work. The only consistent materials are concrete blocks laid sideways a block's length apart. The gap between them is infilled with anything that could be used, including quarry tiles, cobbles, bricks and paving stones. The only brief was that no two sections should be alike. In the vegetable garden, we now have brick pavers. These are like bricks, but baked much harder so that they take more wear and tear and, crucially, will not break up when they freeze. The down side is that they are brittle and prone to cracking when you lay them, and they look very new. I don't mind the latter, but we had to look through scores of variations before finding a paver that worked with the existing brick paths.</p> <p>Pavers are not cheap, so we then used them as narrow 'paths-within-a-path' down the centre of some of the grass paths. This is both handsome and practical, as you can mow over them and yet walk and wheel a barrow down the centre in the slushiest of weather. The plan is to continue this throughout the garden. The problem is not just the expense of the pavers but that beneath them is what amounts to a trench 12 to 18in deep, half of which is filled with hardcore, then a generous layer of scalpings tamped down very hard, then a thick layer of sand on which the pavers are laid. If you have very well-drained soil, you won't need such elaborate measures to ensure drainage, but for us it is essential.</p> <p>Our final paths, in the Jewel garden, are topped with a material called Redgra. This is a kind of pink sand with an element of clay that binds it solid when laid. You prepare the path with hardcore and a layer of scalpings, then spread a thin layer of this binding surface which you bang in with a whacker plate. It goes on almost as sand, but after 24 hours it is pretty solid. It is much cheaper and easier to lay than paving or brick, but if it doesn't have really sharp drainage it can get almost muddy in very wet weather and has less integral character.</p> <p>In the end, a path has to work. Feet and wheels must find them easy the year round. But what materials you use will influence the way your garden looks as much as the surrounding planting, so choose well.</p> <p><strong>My roots</strong></p> <p>I finally got round to cutting the box balls last week. Not balls - pebbles. Even I balk at the pretension of this, so will wait a while until their pebbleness manifests itself more obviously than as mere lopsided balls. But they are in an active state of becoming pebbles, and I must admit that this gives me a huge amount of excited pleasure. </p> <p>Once a year, when I cut them, I know for sure that I am doing the right thing. I have put off the job for months - I would normally expect to do it in June - because of the palaver of clearing the clippings up. Not because I am too grand to do that part of the chore, but because the 63 box pebbles are set in cobbles. Geddit? Big, green, living cobbles set in small stone ones. Everything all of a piece. </p> <p>However, the thousands of knobbles of stone make sweeping a nightmare, with box-leaf confetti wedged in the cobbled interstices. So I put off cutting it until I could get hold of a garden vacuum cleaner. I had one years ago and it was useless for me then, in a brand new garden made up of a bare field, dreams and 18in hedges, so I gave it to my father-in-law. But, over the years, I have secretly hankered after a garden vacuum cleaner again and, the other day, I finally got round to hiring one for these box blobs. It worked a treat. Fantastic. </p> <p>The only fly in the ointment was that the electric hedge trimmer decided to stop working while I went for a cup of tea. It worked beautifully until I stopped it and put it down, and then it refused to cut a thing. I fiddled with it for an hour, made it worse, and did the rest with shears. </p> <p>Before I started, I took cuttings from the most vigorous of the box ovoids, lining them out directly into the seed bed in the vegetable garden. I'll keep them cloched over winter and they should form the stock for my plan to line all the vegetable beds with box hedges. I like the idea of these vigorous spheroids spawning sharp-edged boxes of box-edged vegetables.</p> <p>We have had a week of wind and heavy rain, which has bashed the poor garden. Two tepees of Burro d'ingenoli climbing beans blew down in the night, snapping six stout hazel rods in the process. This is not so much due to the force of the wind but the incredible top growth of the beans. </p> <p>I have never seen any like it. They are delicious, too, with a buttery, slippy texture, cooked whole regardless of size. I shall definitely grow more next year.</p>",
  "<p>It was like a wonder goal scored on the counter-attack by his beloved Manchester United. ITV chiefs, arguing among themselves over what to do about News at Ten, took their eyes off the ball. Greg Dyke and Sir Christopher Bland (the Nobby Stiles and Sir Bobby Charlton of the TV world) saw their chance. </p> <p>Dyke put in one of his trade-mark crunching tackles while the ref wasn't looking, got the ball and threaded it to Blandie with only the out-of-form goalkeeper Chris 'Butterfingers' Smith to beat. Bang - the ball is in the back of the net. Offside? Despite protests, the flag stays down. One-nil to Dyke's barmy BBC army! The crowd goes wild. </p> <p>Dyke has spent much of the nine months since becoming director-general making deep cuts in BBC overheads and building up a programming war chest. Now comes phase two, a year earlier than planned. Dyke has started to spend the extra cash on a schedule so aggressive that it produces a double bang for every buck. Suddenly the hopeless old BBC, the whipping boy of British TV for two decades, is ahead of game. </p> <p>His dabbling with the magic 10pm slot for the nation's 20 million viewers goes back to the early Nineties when, as chairman of the ITV companies' association, he first tried to remove News at Ten from the schedule. The show bunged up the entire evening. The regulators' 'family viewing' watershed meant, as it still does, that most hit movies - and much modern, sex-laden infotainment - could not start until 9pm, which meant interrupting a film halfway through to show the news. </p> <p>In the newly competitive world of British television deliberately brought into being by the 1990 Broadcasting Act, most senior ITV people thought that it absurd that the country's main mixed entertainment channel could not show movies on weeknights because of regulation. Dyke led the lobbying for News at Ten to be axed. </p> <p>His logic seemed unanswerable. The new cable and satellite channels, which the Government was then keen to see launched, were not bound to show news at any particular time. The new channels were making painful inroads into ITV audiences by scheduling their best (or least worst) material against News at Ten. </p> <p>But Dyke was frustrated then, and ended up being vilified and by his old foe Gerald Kaufman at the Commons National Heritage Select Committee. He was fingered as the ultimate ITV fat cat who was putting ratings, profits and personal gain before programme quality and the health of democracy. </p> <p>Dyke had been prepared to tough it out, and was aghast when the new commercial owners of key ITV companies, such as Carlton and Granada, caved in to the politicians. He claimed that Granada's Gerry Robinson and Carlton's Michael Green had at first supported the move but blocked it when they realised that, in return, the Government might at last allow the series of profitable ITV mergers they were planning to go ahead. </p> <p>Those mergers ended Dyke's career in ITV. And to rub salt into Dyke's wounds, Robinson and Green dumped News at Ten soon after the mergers started to take place. </p> <p>Against this background it would churlish to deny the director-general a moment of personal pleasure in putting one over on ITV last week. The move will leave ITV, Channel 5 and, to a lesser extent, Sky on the back foot in the ratings war. </p> <p>Channel 5, as Dyke, its former chief, knows, has built its modest ratings but huge financial success by playing a movie at 9pm nightly. This cleverly exploitsthe BBC's Nine O'Clock News, using it as a sort of free 'advert' - reminding millions that it is show time further along the dial the minute the Nine's upmarket graphics - Belgrade, Jerusalem, Timbuktu and weird minimalist music - come on the screen. </p> <p>Channel Five was annoyed by Dyke's coup, complaining like the heads of ITV and Sky that competition for viewers which threatened their profits was not what they bought their licences for. </p> <p>As ever, the licence is what the argument is all about. The BBC's critics, led by the Times - itself financially dependent on Rupert Murdoch's media empire, including direct BBC rivals such as Sky - say the fee should be spent on expensive programmes which draw relatively few viewers. </p> <p>The paper which, on other occasions, has campaigned for the abolition of the fee and opposed its increase, defines the BBC's 'public service' role as a non-commercial safety net where material such as saturation coverage of the Queen Mother's birthday ought to be shown, leaving the commercial broadcasters to rake in huge profits from Who Wants to be a Millionaire and Premier League football without effective competition from Auntie. But Dyke defines public service differently, more in line with what the BBC's charter actually says and the way in which it is thus established by law. This 'public service' simply means providing the public with the best possible service in return for the licence fee. </p> <p>So, returning to a football metaphor, Dyke knows audiences will only continue to pay cheerfully for their licence 'season tickets' if the BBC keeps putting the ball in the net. Anything less risks relegation from Premier League broadcasting towards semi-professional status (the fate of almost every other public sector broadcaster in the world), leaving the UK field clear for private would-be monopolists such as the emerging national ITV and BSkyB. </p> <p> Chris Horrie is co-author of 'Citizen Greg', published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>",
  "<p>In Mel Brook's 1968 cult classic, The Producers, his main character, played by the late Zero Mostel, was looking for a Broadway vehicle to produce which would be a sure-fire flop so that he would never have to pay back his gullible investors. He settled on a musical, Springtime for Hitler , complete with high-stepping Nazi chorus lines dancing in a jolly swastika formation. Surely, believed Mostel and his side-kick, Gene Wilder, anything to do with Hitler would be a guaranteed disaster. </p> <p>Jodie Foster, who was six and had already been acting for three years when The Producers was originally released, is discovering that even a film about the woman who made 'The Film' about the Nazis provokes the sort of feelings that The Producers were hoping for. The controversy over her desire to tackle the subject of Leni Riefenstahl, who made the Triumph of the Will as an official record of the 1934 Nuremberg rally and was later charged and eventually cleared of Nazi collaboration, has surfaced once more with a fellow-Oscar winner saying that he was horrified that such a film should be made. </p> <p>Arnold Schwartzman, who won an Academy Award for his documentary, Genocide, said last week: 'A lot of people in Hollywood are horrified at this... There will be many objections. Leni Riefenstahl was probably the best propaganda tool that Hitler had and a lot of terrible things that happened were as a consequence of what she did.' </p> <p>For Foster, who will be 38 next month, the reaction to her project would have come as no surprise. 'I'm going to catch shit on that one,' she told Rachel Abramowitz, the author of the recently-published Is That A Gun In Your Pocket? , an analysis of women's experience of power in Hollywood. She has not underestimated the capacity that Riefenstahl, now 98, has to arouse enormous passions more than 60 years after she made her epic and spectacular homage to Aryan supremacy. </p> <p>Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, which starts with a shot of Hitler descending from the skies in his plane in 1934, was one of the most famously powerful pieces of propaganda ever filmed and was banned for years after the war for fear that it still had the potency to spark a Nazi revival. Her film Olympia, about the 1936 Olympic games and a hymn to physical perfection, won the Mussolini prize, then the top award at the Venice Film Festival. She covered the Nazi invasion of Poland as a photo-journalist and is alleged to have used Gypsy concentration camp victims as extras in what was to be her last film, Tiefland, which was only finally finished in 1954. </p> <p>At the end of the war Riefenstahl was jailed first by the Americans and then the French and spent four years behind bars before being eventually cleared of collaboration by a West German de-Nazification court. She became a photo-journalist in Africa, made a famous photographic study of the Nuba tribes in Sudan and came to America to receive an award at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado, where she was roundly booed by Holocaust survivors. Her memoirs, published seven years ago, claimed that she had been na\u00efve and ignorant rather than a Nazi supporter but a 1993 documentary, directed by Ray Mueller and entitled The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, cast doubt on those claims. </p> <p>It is this strange life that attracted the attention of Foster and it is Foster's interest that has attracted the attention of those who have attacked the project of the film. </p> <p>'I think it will be the most challenging film of my life, but it's something I've wanted to do for a long time,' Foster told the Ottawa Citizen earlier this year. 'There is no other woman in the twentieth century who has been so adored and so vilified simultaneously.' </p> <p>Foster knew that it would be a controversial choice and she is not deterred by the fact that a German company is already working with Riefenstahl's co-operation on one version of the story. Foster, as well as planning to star in the Riefenstahl film, is co-producer with her production company, Egg Pictures, backing the movie. </p> <p>While some have attacked the very idea of making such a film, a fellow director said yesterday that the project was a valid one as there was no suggestion that Foster would act in any way as an apologist for her subject. </p> <p>This is not the first time that the actor-director has been faced with having to defend her work. The Los Angeles-born Disney child star was still only 14 when she played Iris, the under-age prostitute in Taxi Driver and the Martin Scorcese film was heavily criticised at the time for its bleak and nihilistic content and for its portrayal of the sexuality of a child. </p> <p>Foster later described how her mother, Brandy, had steered her to the part: 'My mother was a real fan of movies. She saw Cassavetes and was into Fassbinder. She talked to me the way she would talk to an adult. Taxi Driver is a really important movie. It's a social statement. It's a movie about alienation. Is this something you feel comfortable with?\"' </p> <p>Foster impressed the Cannes Film Festival when she attended as a young teenager and with her flawless French - she was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Francais in Los Angles - translated for Scorcese and De Niro to the amazement of the film press. </p> <p>When she was still a child she had already played a gangster's moll in Bugsy Malone and a little murderess in The Little Girl Who Lived Down the Lane . Playing 11-year-old Audrey in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore , she asks another child: 'Wanna get high on Ripple?' But unlike many other child stars, she was simultaneously an academic star and turned down many parts so that she could eventually take her BA in literature at Yale. </p> <p>In the meantime, she had attracted the unwelcome attention of John Hinckley Jnr, the man who tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan in 1981 and claimed he had done so to win Foster's approbation. She was subjected to a hellish experience of threats and stalking by both Hinckley and one of his imitators that has understandably made her protective of her privacy and that of her two-year-old son, Charles Foster. She has, in fact, remained adamantly closed-mouthed about who might be Charles's father, and refused to even to comment on speculation that he may have been conceived artificially. </p> <p>She made the graduation from child actor to adult actor so successfully that she won Oscars both for her part as a rape victim in The Accused in 1988 and for FBI agent Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs in 1991. She has subsequently turned down the chance to reprise the role in the sequel. There have been lesser known films such as Five Corners, Stealing Home, Candleshoe, Moi , Fleur Bleu (Stop Calling Me Baby!), and Nell in 1994 for which she was Oscar-nominated again. She also made a little-seen Italian film called Il Casotto in 1977. </p> <p>She made her first move into directing with Little Man Tate in 1991 of which the French director Louis Malle said: 'Jodie's film is basically about the profound loneliness of childhood and she's dealing with it head on. I would be happy and proud to have made the film she did.' Home for the Holidays, which she made four years later with actors Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jnr, Anne Bancroft and Geraldine Chaplin, was less well received. She has run into problems not of her making with Flora Plum , a circus story which has been delayed after one of its stars, Russell Crowe, injured his shoulder and shooting had to stop. She has not given up the day job: Anna and the King , last year's non-musical version of the King and I, allowed her a chance to play an English governess for a fee of $15 million. The Riefenstahl film would provide a further test of both her directorial and acting skills. </p> <p>Whatever happens to the Riefenstahl project, which would have to examine the way in which the Nazis justified cruelty and the justification of horrific acts, is something Jodie Foster addressed when she won her first Oscar for The Accused . She said in her speech: 'Cruelty might be human and it might be cultural but it's not acceptable, which is what this movie is about.' </p> <p><strong> ALICIA CHRISTIAN FOSTER</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> AKA: </strong> Jodie </p> <p><strong> DoB:</strong> 19 November 1962, LA </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> Lyc\u00e9e Francais, LA; Yale (BA in literature) </p> <p><strong> First TV: </strong> In advert for suntan lotion (aged three) </p> <p><strong> Other TV: </strong> Bonanza , Gunsmoke , The Partridge Family </p> <p><strong> First major film: </strong> Taxi Driver (1976) as Iris, a 12-year-old prostitute </p> <p><strong> Best known as:</strong> Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs (1991)</p>",
  "<p>So call me a liar. I was standing in front of the New York Hilton Hotel when the limousine carrying International Monetary Fund director Horst Kohler zoomed by, hitting a bump. Out flew a confidential report, Ecuador Interim Country Assistance Strategy. You suspect that's not how I got it, but you can trust me that it contains the answer to a puzzling question. </p> <p>Inside the Hilton, Professor Anthony Giddens told an earnest crowd of London School of Economics alumni that 'globalisation is a fact, and it is driven by the communications revolution'. </p> <p>Wow. That was an eye-opener. The screeching green-haired freaks outside the hotel demonstrating against the IMF had it all wrong. </p> <p>Globalisation, Giddens seems to say, is about giving every villager in the Andes a Nokia internet-enabled mobile phone. What puzzled me is why anyone would protest against this happy future. </p> <p>So I thumbed through my purloined IMF Strategy for Ecuador seeking a chapter on connecting the country's schools to the world wide web. Instead, I found a secret schedule. By 1 November this year, it says, its government is ordered to raise the price of cooking gas by 80 per cent. It must eliminate 26,000 jobs and halve real wages for the remaining workers by 50 per cent in four steps in months specified by the IMF. It must begin to transfer ownership of its biggest water system to foreign operators by July and grant BP's Arco subsidiary the right to build and own an oil pipeline over the Andes. </p> <p>That's for starters. In all, the IMF's 167 loan conditions look less like an assistance plan and more like a blueprint for a financial coup d'\u00e9tat. </p> <p>The IMF would say it has no choice. Ecuador is broke, thanks to the implosion of its commercial banks. But how did Ecuador, an Opec member with resources to spare, end up in such a pickle? </p> <p>For that, we have to turn back to 1983, when the IMF forced its government to take over the soured private debts owed by Ecuador's elite to foreign banks. For this bail-out of US and local financiers, Ecuador borrowed $1.5 billion. </p> <p>To repay this loan, the IMF dictated price hikes for electricity and other necessities. And when that didn't drain off enough cash, yet another assistance plan required the state to eliminate 120,000 jobs. </p> <p>Furthermore, while trying to meet the mountain of IMF obligations, Ecuador foolishly 'liberalised' its tiny financial market, cutting local banks loose from government controls and letting private debt and interest rates explode. </p> <p>Who pushed Ecuador into this nutty romp with free-market banking? Hint: the initials are IMF. It made bank liberalisation a condition of another berserk assistance plan. The facts of this nasty little history come from the IMF report marked: 'Please do not cite.' Pretend I didn't. </p> <p>The IMF and the World Bank have lent a sticky helping hand to scores of nations. Take Tanzania. Today, 1.4 million people there are getting ready to die. They are the 8 per cent of the nation's population who have the Aids virus. The financial 'rescuers' found a brilliant neo-liberal solution: require Tanzania to charge for hospital visits, previously free. This cut the number of patients treated in the three big public hospitals in the capital, Dar es Salaam, by 53 per cent. The financial cures must be working. </p> <p>The bodies told Tanzania to charge school fees. Now the bank expresses surprise that school enrolment is down from 80 per cent to 66 per cent. </p> <p>Altogether the Bank and IMF have 157 other helpful suggestions for Tanzania, and the Tanzanian government secretly agreed last April to adopt them all. It was sign or starve. No developing nation can borrow hard currency without IMF blessing (except China, whose output grows at 5 per cent a year thanks to it studiously following the reverse of IMF policies). </p> <p>The IMF and World Bank have effectively controlled Tanzania's economy since 1985. Admittedly, when they took charge they found a socialist nation mired in poverty, disease and debt. </p> <p>Their experts wasted no time in cutting trade barriers, limiting government subsidies and selling off state industries. This worked wonders. According to bank-watcher Nancy Alexander of the Washington-based Globalisation Challenge Initiative,in just 15 years Tanzania's GDP has dropped from $309 to $210 per capita, the literacy rate is falling and the rate of abject poverty has jumped to 51 per cent of the population. </p> <p>Yet somehow the bank has failed to win over the hearts and minds of Tanzanians to its free-market gameplan. Last June, the bank reported in frustration: 'One legacy of socialism is that most people continue to believe the state has a fundamental role in promoting development and providing social services.' </p> <p>The World Bank and the IMF were born in 1944 with simple, laudable mandates: between them to fund post-war reconstruction and development projects and lend hard currency to nations left skint by temporary balance of payments deficits. </p> <p>But in 1980 they seemed to take on an alien form. In the early Eighties, Third World nations, haemorrhaging after the fivefold increases in oil prices and a similar jump in dollar interest payments, brought their begging bowls to the two bodies. But instead of debt relief, they received structural assistance plans listing an average of 114 'conditionalities' in return for capital. </p> <p>The particulars varied from nation to nation, but in every case, they had to remove trade barriers, sell national assets to foreign investors, slash social spending and make labour 'flexible' (that is, crush unions). </p> <p>Some say the vicious policy change resulted from the election that year of Ronald Reagan as US President, the quickening of Margaret Thatcher's powers and the beginning of the neo-liberal ascendency. (My own information is that the IMF and World Bank were taken over by a space alien named Larry. It's obvious that 'Larry' Summers, once World Bank chief economist and now US Treasury Secretary, is really a platoon of extra- terrestrials sent to turn much of the human race into a source of cheap protein. But I digress.) </p> <p>So what have The Aliens accomplished with their e free-market prescriptions? An article by Samuel Brittan in last week's Financial Times declared that the new world capital markets and free trade have 'brought about an unprecedented increase in world living standards'. Brittan cites the huge growth in GDP per capita, life expectancy and literacy in the less developed world from 1950 to 1995. </p> <p>Now hold on a minute. Until 1980, virtually every nation in his survey was either socialist or welfare statist. They were developing on the 'Import Substitution Model', by which locally-owned industry was built through government investment and high tariffs, anathema to the neoliberals. </p> <p>In those dark ages of increasing national government control and ownership (1960-1980), per capita income grew by 73 per cent in Latin America and by 34 per cent in Africa. By comparison, since 1980, Latin American growth has come to a virtual halt, growing by less than 6 per cent over 20 years - and African incomes have declined by 23 per cent. </p> <p>Now let's count the corpses. From 1950 to 1980, socialist and statist welfare policies added more than a decade of life expectancy to virtually every nation on the planet. From 1980 to today, life under structural assistance has become brutish and shorter. Since 1985, the total number of illiterate people has risen and life expectancy is falling in 15 African nations. Brittan attributes this to 'bad luck, [not] the international economic system'. In the former Soviet states, where IMF and World Bank shock plans hold sway, life expectancy has plunged, adding 1.4 million a year to the death rate in Russia alone. </p> <p>Admittedly, the World Bank and IMF are reforming. The dreaded structural assistance plans have been renamed 'poverty reduction strategies'. Doesn't that make you feel better? </p> <p>Recently, the IMF admitted that 'in the recent decades, nearly one-fifth of the world population have regressed' - arguably 'one of the greatest economic failures of the twentieth century.' And that, Professor Giddens, is a fact. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There is a mysterious kind of movie title that is not explained in the film itself and demands some special knowledge. A Clockwork Orange, Straw Dogs and O Brother, Where Art Thou? are examples. The amiable Where the Money Is, directed by Marek Kanievska, a British filmmaker best known for Another Country, from a script by three Americans, belongs in this category. </p> <p>Nobody uses the phrase in the film and, surprisingly, it is not in any dictionary of quotations I possess. But it is generally attributed to the legendary American criminal Willie Sutton, who spent most of his life in jail and the rest of it planning heists. Asked in old age why he persisted in robbing banks, Willie replied: 'Because that's where the money is', and it is clear that Henry, the elderly thief played by Paul Newman, is modelled on Willie Sutton. </p> <p>This clever comedy-thriller begins with Henry, a convict well into his seventies, being temporarily installed in a public geriatric hospital in Oregon. He is speechless and paralysed from a stroke two years before, and thus considered harmless by the state and no threat to the largely female inmates. But his notorious career staging ingenious hold-ups coast to coast causes a flutter among his fellow patients and excites the special interest of Carol (the seductive Linda Fiorentino), an attractive nurse whose marriage to her boorish high-school sweetheart, Wayne (Dermot Mulroney), has gone sour. </p> <p>The frustrated Carol suspects that Henry is feigning his condition, or perhaps unconsciously hopes he is. Anyway, after a leisurely, interestingly detailed opening half-hour, she rumbles Henry. </p> <p>Having studied autohypnosis, this brilliant, amoral loner has managed to convince doctors, psychiatrists and warders that he has been permanently incapacitated by the stroke. </p> <p>'It's not enough to play possum,' the sprightly charmer tells his two new pupils. 'You've got to be possum.' That is as good a description of method acting as you can get; Newman and Henry are consummate performers whom you rarely catch acting. </p> <p>Henry subsequently masterminds from his wheel-chair his last big heist. To assist him, he inducts Carol and Wayne into the art of theft, the way Sean Connery does Catherine Zeta Jones in Jon Amiel's Entrapment and Burt Reynolds does Casey Siemaszko in Bill Forsyth's Breaking In (American movies that also happen to have British directors). </p> <p>Wayne wants the wages of sin, but lacks the spirit to enjoy transgression. Carol, on the other hand, becomes radiant, is renewed and liberated by embarking on a life of crime, in a manner reminiscent of Peggy Cummins in the subversive classic Gun Crazy and Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde. However, a violent bout of vomiting before setting out on the final job reveals suppressed qualms and fear. </p> <p>The chosen target is not a bank but an armoured car, and the scheme is to hijack one and then themselves make the nightly collection at supermarkets, bars, filling stations, an amusement park and a sports stadium. 'You don't rob the route, you rob the crew,' says Henry, explaining why they need to study the behaviour of the armoured-car drivers. His object as always is to carry out the operation without shooting; in fact, almost the film's only act of violence comes in some well-deserved revenge on a crooked male nurse. </p> <p>There are some holes in the plot and a few improbabilities in Where the Money Is, but generally this beguiling film goes its antisocial way in a stately, magisterial manner befitting the age and stature of its protagonist and its star. </p> <p>The script is peppered with sharp dialogue that Newman handles impeccably. He tells a cautionary tale about a friend's greyhound on a Florida racetrack that caught up with the hare and was electrocuted - 'He got what he wanted, but not what he expected.' </p> <p>His best line comes when the police surround them at Fiorentino's house and a sheriff barks through a megaphone: 'Come out with your hands on your heads.' Newman's blue eyes sparkle: 'You haven't lived till you've heard someone say that to you.' </p> <p>Newman, who is 75, has said that this will be his last movie. One hopes not, as he has done fine work during the past decade. He emerged on the screen 45 years ago under the shadow of his fellow Actors Studio graduates, Marlon Brando and James Dean, and because of Dean's early death and Brando's professional indolence, he has long since outstripped them. He has also been, while living an orderly life and conducting a disciplined career, a greater rebel than either. </p> <p>Newman has proved himself equally adept at comedy and drama (think of The Sting and Butch Cassidy), though only occasionally has he been an orthodox hero, as in Exodus, one of the few occasions he has played a Jew. </p> <p>His great strength over the years is the insight he has brought to outsiders, anti-authoritarian rebels as different as the eponymous heroes of Hud, Hombre and Cool Hand Luke . </p> <p>On the other hand, he gave one of his finest performances in Mr and Mrs Bridge, playing the very embodiment of middle-class, small-town conformity. </p> <p>Possibly his greatest film is The Hustler (1961), which established him as an actor of stature and, 25 years later, in The Color of Money, Newman was able to revisit the same character, to see how he had changed and grown, and at last win an Oscar.</p>",
  "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.'</p> <p>Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' </p> <p>The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.'</p> <p>We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,379043,00.html\">Read Philip French's analysis of Poitier's career here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier is published by Simon &amp; Schuster for \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "As grimacing pumpkins adorn porches for Halloween, a director's cut of the movie The Exorcist, with more head-twisting, growling and vomiting, is drawing massive crowds. <p>For the Catholic Church and throughout the Baptist South, the launch of the movie will be a call to do God's work. There will be a surge of real-life exorcisms performed by real-life exorcists.' </p> <p>We have an increasing demand,' says Father James LeBar, exorcist for the archdiocese of New York, 'and we don't have the manpower to meet it.' The imminent release of Blair Witch II will add to the demand. </p> <p>The nation has seen an increase in crimes supposedly resembling demonic rituals - including torture, murder and sacrifice - or else claimed by their perpetrators to have been ordered by Satan. </p> <p>The school massacres at Columbine, Colorado, and Pearl, Mississippi, were said to have Satanist connections, as was a human sacrifice in Kansas. 'We are living in an occult age,' says the Reverend Brian Connor, of South Carolina, who insists that 'dealing with animate evil is the single most overlooked component of the biblical mandate'. </p> <p>Last week it was revealed that the archdiocese of Chicago has secretly appointed a full-time exorcist to combat the rise in Satan-worship and what the Church insists is demonic possession. The unnamed exorcist will only speak through church officials to say that his task is 'to heal those afflicted by the Evil One'. From his rectory at the Regina Coeli church in the upstate New York town of Hyde Park, LeBar is more open about his calling. 'It's not a question of whether I like it or not,' he says. 'It's what I've been asked to do by the late Cardinal O'Connor. But I do find it an uplifting of my faith.' </p> <p>He is now preparing for his next exorcism a few weeks from now, but has been casting out demons for five years. His expertise has never been in such high demand, he says. </p> <p>Grey-haired and bespectacled, the 64-year-old looks a little like Max von Sydow, who plays the veteran exorcist in the film, and he insists that the exorcism scene in the movie is realistic. </p> <p>'It pretty much shows what it can be like,' he says. 'It's a compilation of things that happen in different real exorcisms; the levitation, the expectoration, the screaming. All of those things take place in every exorcism'. LeBar describes occasions in which his subjects do howl when sprayed with holy water and speak in languages they have never studied. 'Sometimes they have great strength and what we call clairvoyance.' </p> <p>Even the pea-green vomit is only an exaggeration. 'In one or two cases, there has been an extraordinary amount of gagging,' he said. In one instance, he says, a 'victim' glided across the room on a chair, without touching the ground. </p> <p>LeBar receives 'several hundred' applications a year from the possessed or their relatives, but many will be dealt with by medical experts, he points out. 'Before we would agree on an exorcism, we would have a psychological examination, a medical check-up and a psychiatric evaluation as well.' </p> <p>Many Christians remain unconvinced of a rise in 'Satanic' crime and are hostile to exorcism in such cases. Near LeBar's church, Jeffrey Viktor, a sociologist, works at the Community College in Jamestown, where a supposedly 'possessed' man went on a rampage three Halloweens ago, spreading his Aids virus among teenage girls. </p> <p>He is scornful of America's gullibility about both possession and exorcism. </p> <p>In a book called The Satanic Panic, he says: 'There are juvenile delinquents who have killed and called themselves Satanists. More commonly, they commit less vicious crimes, like killing domestic animals or turning over tombstones. Teenagers may read about Satanism, do some hocus-pocus and call themselves Satanists. </p> <p>'But sociologically speaking, a gang of juvenile delinquents does not constitute a religion.'</p>",

His stark, unflinching portrayals of reality were in marked contrast to the Counter-Reformation kitsch of his stunned peers.</p> <p>Robb's biography seeks to interweave Caravaggio's controversial art with a life full of violence and mystery. Information is scarce, particularly on the murky circumstances of Caravaggio's death, and Robb frequently has recourse to speculations and projections. He is helped in this by a firm grasp both of the political machinations and seedy streetlife of seventeenth-century Italy, by his engaging, conversational tone and, most importantly, by his brilliant readings of the paintings themselves.

She has interviewed a wide variety of men in a broad range of social circumstances, and the sheer legwork involved in her project must be admired.

  "<p>The bitter battle to run the National Lottery descended into new chaos last night after it was revealed that the company giving legal advice on the bidding process had regularly worked for Richard Branson's Virgin empire.</p> <p>The Observer can disclose that Freshfields, the leading City law firm hired by the Lottery Commission, has acted for Branson and Virgin companies. Its website reveals a series of cases in which it acted for Virgin. Freshfields was appointed to advise the commission earlier this month after Treasury solicitors were dismissed for giving 'defective and calamitous' advice. </p> <p>Anthony Salz, Freshfield's senior partner, has also advised Branson, whose People's Lottery consortium is battling against Camelot to win the new licence to run the lottery. </p> <p>Last week solicitors for Camelot wrote to Freshfields demanding answers about a potential conflict of interest. The letter asked if the firm had considered its position carefully before agreeing to the work. Freshfields has written back, saying the company did consider its position. The commission was fully informed of all previous links between the firm, Branson and Virgin. </p> <p>A spokesman for Branson said past links between Virgin and Freshfields were 'neither here nor there' and that Freshfields had also advised Camelot in the past. Strong safeguards were in place to ensure there was no conflict of interest, a source said. The spokesman said any relationship between Branson and Salz had ended 'a decade ago'. </p> <p>'Conflict issues do arise frequently,' a Freshfields spokeswoman said. 'All lawyers have to think very carefully before they accept a new client to see whether it is proper for them to do so.' </p> <p>Peter Ainsworth, the Shadow Culture Secretary, said that the latest row over the lottery showed how careful all sides needed to be. 'It is a question of perception, and perception is vital,' he said. 'It is absolutely essential that confidence is restored. All relationships must be whiter than white.' </p> <p>The news comes following disclosures yesterday that Alan Howarth, the Arts Minister in the department overseeing the lottery bidding process, was a paid adviser to Branson between 1992 and 1996. </p> <p>The Camelot letter is the latest salvo in the battle to win the contract to run the lottery. Camelot successfully challenged in the High Court the commission's decision to negotiate solely with the People's Lottery, a move which has led to chaos and delay in the bidding process. </p> <p>Branson last night attacked Camelot for not having public interest at heart. In his first public comments since The Observer revealed last week that the bidding process was approaching meltdown, Branson said that Camelot had used 'every tactic in the book' to try to undermine the process. </p> <p>He said he would hold emergency meetings with suppliers to the People's Lottery this week to see if it was possible to meet the new timetable for introducing the lottery. </p> <p>'Apart from the delaying tactics and maybe making a little bit of extra money, what are Camelot trying to achieve?' he said. 'The possibility of Camelot winning is something which I just can't see, to be honest. </p> <p>'To start the whole process again would be an absolute nightmare. There is a suspicion that Camelot would like to see the process started again because they know in a sense what the results are already. </p> <p>'Anything to destroy this process is in their interests. It is certainly not in the interests of the people in this country.' </p> <p>A senior government source said that it was becoming increasingly exasperated by the high-profile media battle over the lottery. </p> <p>Three days after The Observer revealed that Camelot was considering fresh legal action against the commission, Dame Helena Shovelton, the commission's chairwoman, resigned. </p> <p>'I think it was an extremely brave decision,' Branson said.

  "It is essential to present yourself as a working-class hero if you are to prosper in the political, media and business \u00e9lites. From the Director General's office at the BBC to the Institute of Directors, from the New Labour to the Old Tory conferences, the powerful inherit the Earth by seeming meek. <p>Tony Blair 'listens' with an attention we haven't witnessed since Di died. Greg Dyke is a victim of toffs who bitch behind their manicured hands about his contempt for public-service journalism. Question the priorities of corporations and you attack the sacred market that is nothing more than the unfettered choice of ordinary people. Do you think they're stupid? Do you dare set yourself above the likes of William 'It's you that I'm in it for' Hague who humbly affirm their wish to obey the vox populi . </p> <p>Many at the top try a prolier-than-thou style that has the advantage of turning critics into reactionary aristocrats, but there isn't an e-business billionaire or newspaper tycoon who can match the master, Jack Straw. The worst Home Secretary of the twentieth - and, if we're lucky, the twenty-first - century denounces his powerless opponents of his \u00e9litist plans to take power from the people as \u00e9litists themselves - and gets away with it. </p> <p>Straw and Lord [Gareth] Williams of Mostyn, the Attorney General, have been fighting for a year to deny citizens the right to elect to be tried by jury for assault, theft, burglary and other middle-ranking offences. All whose work includes handling money know that convictions for dishonesty brings the loss of reputation, whatever punishment the courts inflicts and the probable loss of their jobs. They will no longer have the power to insist that they are innocent until found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by a jury of their peers. By extension, about 80,000 people a year will no longer have the power to sit on juries and decide on the guilt or innocence of their neighbours. Power will flow to the growing number of professional stipendiary magistrates appointed in secret by Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, who is in office because he was the patron of Tony Blair and Cherie Booth when they were young barristers on the make. </p> <p>Short of abolishing the franchise, it is hard to imagine a more \u00e9litist assault on popular rights. Yet Straw poses as the people's tribune whose rough but ready working-man's fists will smash the snobs until they bow to the will of the silent majority. Those who defend trial by jury were pampered 'BMW-driving civil liberties lawyers', he sneered. They lived in Hampstead and subscribed to a 'woolly-minded liberalism', which took 'no account of the situation of those who are less favoured than they'. </p> <p>He forgot to mention that at the last election he was the most louche limousine liberal in the land. 'Surely cutting down the right to jury trial ... is not only wrong but short-sighted,' he drawled in 1997 when Michael Howard proposed the assault on juries he was destined to ape. Tony Blair was no more in touch with the concerns of plain, decent folk. The poor little rich boy didn't understand that ordinary people love to be patronised but thought that 'fundamental rights to justice cannot be driven by administrative convenience'. Meanwhile Gareth Williams revealed himself to be the most isolated of Hampstead hermits when he said in 1993 that it was 'madness' to abolish juries. </p> <p>After all we've been through, these gentlemen's apostasy is no longer surprising. What has been remarkable is the speed with which Straw's and Williams's mendacity has been exposed. Straw began by claiming that his enemies were the forces of conservatism who opposed any change. Why when Roy Jenkins had introduced majority verdicts in the Sixties he had been attacked by the very types who were shouting at him today. Jenkins stood up in the House of Lords on 20 January. He had allowed juries to find a criminal guilty by a majority of 10 to two to stop them from being nobbled by gangsters, he said. He had protected juries, Straw was abolishing them. 'I cannot allow the Home Secretary to claim my endorsement for this ill-conceived little bill, so directly contrary to everything that he and his spokesman said in opposition.' </p> <p>The Scots did not have the right to ask for jury trial for assault and the like, continued Straw, why should the English and Welsh be different? The Scottish barrister and Labour peer Helena Kennedy made the obvious riposte in the Lords last month. Scotland has a separate legal system with its own safeguards. Straw was not proposing to introduce Scottish procurators fiscal and 'not proven' verdicts, rather he was collecting the most repressive features of different jurisdictions and pasting them together in a grim collage. In any case, English readers may say, who cares if the Scots arrange these matters differently? Aren't we meant to take a pride in Englishness and cherish what is best about us in this age of devolution? If there is anything in England better than the democratic right to be tried by your peers I have yet to find it. </p> <p>Williams opened a new front the other day when he sobbed that he wanted to protect victims from the delays jury trials bring to justice. With the exception of saints and masochists, victims want criminals to pay for their crimes. Yet when suspects opt for a jury trial and lose, Crown Court judges give far stiffer punishments than magistrates. The Home Office admits as much. The sav ings it predicts the nobbling of jurors will bring are based on the assumption that the cost of running our bulging prison system will fall as softer sentences are issued. Not much joy for victims there. </p> <p>The same objection meets Straw's claim that professional criminals are abusing the system by asking for a jury trial. Why would they court a longer stretch? Citizens who are not Napoleons of crime do. Some take the risk because they have been overcharged by an understaffed and not noticeably competent Crown Prosecution Service and agree to plead guilty when the Crown Court has made prosecutors agree to hit them with a lesser crime. Others are protesting their innocence and believe, as all of us believe, that a jury will give them a fairer trial. </p> <p>And so it goes on. Straw told the Commons on 7 March that his plan 'enjoys the active endorsement of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham'. Bingham revealed that a fortnight earlier he had sent a letter to the Home Secretary in which he wrote of his 'unease' about the 'dangers' of the legislation. Straw claimed that Professor Michael Zander, chairman of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, supported him. Zander said he did not. Straw said that 95 per cent of cases in Britain are heard by magistrates without a jury so there was no harm in slipping a few more trials in their direction. It was left to others to say that nearly all defendants plead guilty in magistrates courts and don't therefore need to bother a jury. If you're ever in trouble don't call the Home Secretary as a witness. There's not a jury in the country which would believe him. </p> <p>So disreputable has the Home Office's case become that when the Lords last threw out the measure, peers such as Melvyn Bragg, Clive Hollick, and Waheed Ali, who are usually dismissed as New Labour stooges, refused to support the Government. In the Commons, Straw has been forced to rely on the payroll vote and Scottish MPs to secure a majority. </p> <p>Everyone who opposes Straw and Williams says they are simply good boys obeying Treasury orders to save money. I'm sure that's true, but beneath the anti-\u00e9litist rhetoric lurks another motive - a scarcely concelaed anxiety about decisions being out of the hands of polite society. </p> <p>Authoritarian governments have always loathed juries. They can put justice before the letter of the law and by refusing, for example, to convict whistleblowers who have broken the Official Secrets Act. Lord Lipsey, a superior journalist turned New Labour peer, revealed establishment fears when he blurted out in February that blacks 'opt for jury trial in the hope that they will get an O.J. Simpson. What they hope is that there will be enough black jurors who are fundamentally hostile to the criminal justice system'. </p> <p>I suppose the only way to solve this shocking state of affairs is to ban all blacks from juries. Or perhaps the Government wants to go further and ban juries completely. Williams said last month that citizens who asked for juries were imposing an intolerable burden on the authorities. The courts were being bullied by the exercise of the 'defendant's diktat'. It was a revealing choice of words. Suspects facing charges which might ruin their lives were oppressors. The helpless state was the victim. </p> <p>A Conservative peer leapt up and rebuked him. The noble lord was Norman Tebbit. When a Labour Attorney General can be attacked from the Left by such a man you realise that Blairism has sunk into irredeemable decadence. </p> <p>The Government will decide in February whether to order the Commons to override the Lords and force Straw's bill into law. In the run up to the election when the \u00e9lite will pose as the champions of anti-\u00e9litism, it will be destroying the democratic liberty. In the name of the people, of course.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists working for Swiss food giant Novartis have developed and patented a method for 'switching off' the immune systems of plants, to the outrage of environmentalists and Third World charities who believe the new technology to be the most dangerous use so far of gene modification. </p> <p>Patents filed by Novartis, manufacturers of Ovaltine, reveal that its scientists expect to be able to use the radical biotechnology for almost every crop on Earth. </p> <p>Novartis claims that the new use of genetic modification will give farmers greater control over disease and boost production. But critics insist that it will make Third World farmers dependent on buying the company's chemicals each year to produce healthy harvests. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Novartis said: 'We are trying to help farmers, not hinder them. We are looking at ways to improve the way plants fight disease.' </p> <p>She agreed that the company had discovered a way of genetically modifying crops so that their immune systems were disabled, but stressed that this was for 'research purposes' only. </p> <p>The process involves transferring a single DNA molecule, described by the firm as the 'NIM gene', to the plant. This gene then reacts with the plant's immune system, allowing it to be switched on selectively by the use of chemicals when disease threatens. But the patent also describes plants where the entire immune system has been switched off, making them highly prone to disease. </p> <p>Environmentalists fear the new technology could have a disastrous ecological impact if crops with their immune systems suppressed are allowed to cross-pollinate with surrounding plant life. The use of GM technology, which uses chemicals to activate genetic traits, was specifically condemned by the UN earlier this year. It recommended that the technology should not be field-tested and called for a moratorium on its development until the impact had been fully assessed. </p> <p>The patent documents seen by The Observer suggest that Novartis intends to use the new GM technology on 'barley, cucumber, tobacco, rice, chilli, wheat, banana and tomato'. </p> <p>The company cites an extensive list of more than 80 crops, including several cereals, dozens of fruit such as apples, pears and strawberries, vegetables like beans and lentils, and cash crops like cotton and tea. </p> <p>Alex Wijeratna of Action Aid, a development charity that works with farmers in developing countries, said: 'We find it extremely frightening that such a powerful multi-national is working on this type of technology, which seems aimed at protecting their profits by threatening the rights of poor farmers.' </p> <p>Dr Sue Mayer, director of Gene Watch, said: 'These companies should halt development of these potentially dangerous products until there has been a proper assessment of whether they are good for agriculture.' </p> <p>On Wednesday, the shareholders of Novartis and biotechnology giant Astra Zeneca will vote on whether to merge and create the world's largest GM company.</p>",
  "The Middle East was on the brink of a violent crisis last night, with the Israeli government threatening 'forceful action' after the capture of Israeli soldiers by Hizbollah guerrillas. <p>American diplomats and President Bill Clinton launched a last-ditch effort to prevent the region slipping into the abyss as the unrest seen throughout the week in Israel and the Palestinian terri-tories continued unabated. </p> <p>Hizbollah claimed to have taken three soldiers prisoner after a massive rocket attack on disputed, Israeli-controlled farms. It was the first such strike since Israel ended its 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon earlier this year. Three Israeli soldiers were injured in the fierce artillery exchange that followed the rocketing. </p> <p>Ehud Barak, the Israeli Prime Minister, demanded that Beirut rein in Hizbollah, which is based in southern Lebanon. '[Barak] called on [them] to stop hostile activity... immediately and exert its authority on all the organisations active there,' the Prime Minister's office said. </p> <p>A similar message was sent to Syria, regarded as the main power broker in Lebanon, the spokesman said. </p> <p>Last night the Americans launched a frantic effort to prevent the situation spiralling out of control. Clinton cancelled a domestic fund-raising trip after talking with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. A White House spokesman said: 'The President has been working on the Middle East since early this morning [Saturday]. Given the situation, he feels he needs to stay.' </p> <p>Many are worried that a fierce row over a UN Security Council resolution seeking to condemn the violence between Israelis and Palestinians will lead to countries throughout the region being dragged into the conflict. </p> <p>The resolution, opposed by Israel, condemns 'excessive use of force against the Palestinian population'. It is feared that an American veto would spark a massive upsurge in the violence of the past 10 days - originally sparked by the visit of the Israeli right- wing politician Ariel Sharon to a site holy to both Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem. So far about 80 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed. </p> <p>Yesterday afternoon the Israeli army made plain its determination to meet force with force. Helicopter gunships and artillery pounded Hizbollah-held areas in southern Lebanon, witnesses said. A man and his three children were reported to have been wounded when Israeli helicopters fired on them as they fled their home. </p> <p>Hizbollah's actions came soon after Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinian demonstrators when they opened fire on a crowd attempting to tear down border fences to reach a Jewish settlement just inside the Lebanese-Israeli frontier. Fourteen demonstrators were also injured in the shooting. </p> <p>The violence in the north of Israel and Hizbollah's intervention ended any hopes that a dawn withdrawal of Israeli troops from a shrine in the West Bank town of Nablus, one of the key flashpoints in the fighting, would lower tensions. </p> <p>A squad of Israeli paramilitary policemen who were protecting the Jewish shrine of Joseph's Tomb as well as an attached religious school pulled out of their bunkers at around 5am. One policeman was shot and wounded as they withdrew. Earlier in the week another policeman was shot dead at the site. </p> <p>Jubilant youths and mask-ed gunmen set the shrine on fire and attacked it with hammers before the Palestinian police moved in. </p> <p>An Israeli government spokesman expressed 'disappointment'. He said: 'If this is the way they respect their commitment, I don't know what it means for the future.' Though right-wing Israeli politicians called the decision to pull out from Nablus 'an embarrassing capitulation', Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority describedit as 'a good step'. </p> <p>Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian Authority spokeswoman, said: 'Pulling out from areas of confrontation and preventing direct provocation would also put an end to clashes and conflict.' </p> <p>As his domestic position weakens, it becomes harder for Barak to make concessions. Hizbollah's seizure of Israeli soldiers will be a major problem for him, though the attacks on farms in the disputed Chebaa region will help him regain an element of the international sympathy lost in recent days. </p> <p>A Hizbollah statement said it carried out the operation 'in fulfilling our pledge to liberate every prisoner and all occupied land and in support of the great struggling Palestinian people'. </p> <p>There are at least a dozen Lebanese held in Israeli prisons, including two guerrilla leaders. Hizbollah has repeatedly pledged to try to secure their release and end Israeli control over the Chebaa farms. </p> <p>Israel captured the land from Lebanon in the Six-Day War of 1967, when its forces took control of the nearby Golan Heights.</p>",
  "For the stone-throwers it was a rare victory. For once they had triumphed against the sniper rifles and machine guns of the Israeli Army. <p>At dawn yesterday a squad of 10 Israeli border policemen abandoned the bunkers in the West Bank town of Nablus where they had been besieged for nine days and made their way back to less exposed positions. On their way, one was shot and wounded. </p> <p>Within minutes, masked Palestinians had broken into the army base and the Jewish shrine of Joseph's Tomb that it was built to protect. Fires were started and religious texts destroyed. </p> <p>The withdrawal from Nablus was made on the orders of the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak. It was the first time that Israeli forces have been forced to pull back as a result of Palestinian violence, and a deeply significant moment. </p> <p>But if the move was meant to put an end to the unrest engulfing Israel and the Palestinian territories, it failed. Clashes recurred yesterday in Gaza and spread elsewhere. Israeli troops killed at least one Palestinian after opening fire on a demonstration at the Lebanese border. </p> <p>More than 80 people have died and 2,000 have been injured in the violence of the last 10 days. Almost all have been Palestinian, and most have been young. </p> <p>Earlier last week, at the major flashpoint of Netzarim Junction in Gaza, The Observer' s reporter watched close hand as angry and excited Arab youths hurled themselves in front of the Israeli guns. They started huddled against a breeze-block wall. Most were stripped to the waist, their bodies black with soot from petrol bombs and streaked by sweat. In their hands were rocks, Palestinian flags and bottles. </p> <p>In twos and threes they leapt through a gap in the wall and charged towards the squat bunkers of the base 30 yards away. Behind them scores more youths, and a handful of older men, shouted encouragement. The air was full of the crackle of flames and shouts of ' Allahu akbar ' (God is great). </p> <p>Every 15 or so minutes, the welter of noise was sliced by a single, sharp report. Each time, with his features twisted in pain, a young man, a youth or a boy aged no older than 10 was carried from the rubble to the ambulances waiting yards away. For hours, the pattern continued. The youths rushed forward, hurling their petrol bombs and bricks. The Israelis carefully, clinically, deliberately dropped one. And the youths merely regrouped and came forward again. They were literally lining up to die. </p> <p>Last week saw mayhem and carnage in Israel and the Palestinian Territories of Gaza and the West Bank on a scale not seen for decades. This troubled land's fate is now in the hands of the extremists, the bigots and the violent. The moderate majority on both sides can only look on in horror. The televised shooting of 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah and his father, Jamal, at Netzarim Junction has shaken the country. </p> <p>The Israelis are now asking themselves: how can such killing ever be justified? Was it too many or too few concessions to the Palestinians that caused the explosion? Can the fragile minority government of Prime Minister Barak - who was elected as a peacemaker in May last year - survive the crisis? A newspaper poll last week showed that more than 70 per cent of Israelis felt that the future existence of their country was in doubt. </p> <p>And questions are also being asked in the scrappy, rundown towns and refugee camps run by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Was the violence orchestrated? Is there any truth in Israeli accusations that their leader has knowingly been sending young Palestinians out to die to score political points? Is it time, they are asking, to forget negotiations and rely on the gun? </p> <p>In the town of Beni Suhaila, in the middle of the 30-mile-long Gaza Strip, they have an answer to the latter, at least. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Mohammed Abu-Assi, an 11-year-old shot dead while throwing stones the day before, was buried. Thousands filled the street to follow his open coffin. Many mourners carried automatic weapons. Some of them carried the green flag of Hamas - the Islamic group responsible for suicide-bomb attacks. </p> <p>The boy's grieving female relatives watched the procession. His younger sister wept. But Umralib, his mother, said she would shed no tears. 'He is a martyr. He is in paradise. He died as a sacrifice for his religion and for our city of Jerusalem. This struggle must go on. There has been enough talking. It is time to fight.' </p> <p>The recent unrest was sparked when, 10 days ago, the veteran right-wing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon, guarded by 1,000 police, visited al-Aqsa's hilltop compound in Jerusalem's walled Old City. His aim was to underline Jewish sovereignty over the site, the third most holy place in Islam, and over Jerusalem as a whole. For Jews, the site is also sacred. But Muslims felt the visit of Sharon, who has a brutal record, violated the sanctity of the shrine - and riots broke out. Within days, the Israelis had deployed tanks. </p> <p>A new religious element fuelled the fighting. A hastily drawn picture on the wall of Mohammed Abu-Assi's home in Beni Suhaila showed the boy's body being borne to paradise with the words 'al-Aqsa' issuing from his mouth. As youths rioted, they shouted the name of the mosque - a rallying cry to Muslims throughout the world. In other Islamic countries there were violent demonstrations in support. </p> <p>But the roots of the Palestinian anger lie deeper - in resentment over the glacial pace of the peace process and their appalling economic conditions. Israelis were particularly shocked to see, for the first time, significant numbers of the million or so Arabs who are Israeli citizens taking to the barricades in Galilee. </p> <p>'We talk and talk for years and nothing happens. So maybe this is the only way. I may be an Israeli citizen, but I am a Muslim and a Palestinian first,' said Hussein, an east Jerusalem market trader, last week. </p> <p>Elsewhere the scenes were more familiar. Gaza, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus were all key sites during the previous 'Intifada' ('shaking off') in the late Eighties. </p> <p>At Netzarim and Ramallah, the focus of anger were the settlements set up by hardline Jews. </p> <p>'Why are they here? This is our land,' said a heavily armed PNA security officer visiting the wounded in Ramallah hospital. He said a gun battle had broken out after the settlers on the hill above the town fired on Palestinian homes. Two local youths had been killed. </p> <p>The settlers say local Palestinian youths - and PNA security officials - often shoot at their houses. Sometimes, they said, they returned fire. </p> <p>The settlers are not popular in Israel. A recent poll showed that 51 per cent of Israeli Jews called themselves 'secular'. Many of the soldiers assigned to protect the settlers see them as troublemakers. </p> <p>But it is also clear that the violence can be controlled. On Wednesday, while negotiations continued in Paris between Barak and Arafat, the riots were small-scale. On Friday - declared a 'day of rage' by the Palestinian leadership - Jerusalem and Gaza erupted. </p> <p>There is little hope of a swift end to the chaos engulfing the county, although Barak's order to withdraw from Nablus may help calm things down. However, his weak political position prohibits major concessions. Yesterday the moderates remained unheard and the extremists dug in. </p> <p>Benny Elon, a right-wing Israeli politician, admitted that the Israelis had lost a battle last week. But, he told me, they 'would win the war'. </p> <p>Abdullah al-Masri, a senior Palestinian security officer at Netzarim Junction, pledged the same. 'We will go on until we have spilt every drop of our blood. The future is black. The clouds will rain bullets.'</p>",
  "What will happen to the peace dividend if the new power-sharing executive in Belfast collapses? As David Trimble fights for his political life, business leaders fear that Northern Ireland's economic recovery will be put at risk if the new devolved institutions are seen to falter. <p>Since the Belfast Agreement was signed in 1998, economic progress has been dramatic. The so-called peace dividend is immediately visible in the scale of new buildings - hotels, office blocks, shopping centres. </p> <p>The Waterfront Hall where David Trimble met the critics within his own party yesterday is a symbol of how things have changed. The airy building stands beside the River Lagan alongside the recently built Hilton Hotel. </p> <p>It is sometimes hard to remember that only a few years ago people were searched as they entered shops and restaurants in Belfast. The official statistics confirm the gains that have been made as a result of the peace process. Once an unemployment black spot, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland is now running below the European Union average. There has been steady success in attracting foreign investment, particularly in hi-tech industries. </p> <p>There are still big problems to be tackled. Northern Ireland's traditional manufacturing industries like shipbuilding are in decline. New jobs will be needed to replace those lost in the police and security firms. These will require people to have different skills, something that can only be achieved by retraining and education. </p> <p>The new assembly at Stormont is currently debating Strategy 2010, an ambitious economic plan which aims to raise Northern Ireland's GDP to 90 per cent of the UK average over the next 10 years. This is a serious consideration of long-term strategy which is far removed from the rancorous scenes when political leaders trade insults over the peace process. </p> <p>But economic progress will be put at risk if the political institutions like the Assembly are seen to falter. Peace isn't just a matter of lack of violence on the streets although this is obviously necessary to persuade multi-national companies to invest. </p> <p>Political stability and a sense that Northern Ireland's leaders are ready and able to take control of the economy are also necessary. So George Quigley, Chairman of Ulster Bank and one of the province's most respected businessmen, believes that the role of the Assembly is vital in deciding policy and ensuring that economic targets are achieved. He points to the role which political leaders 'and an almost obsessive drive for economic growth' have played in shaping the success of the Republic's economy. </p> <p>This has been missing in Northern Ireland for obvious reasons. Direct rule has meant that local politicians have lacked the clout to lobby effectively in the corridors of power. Thirty years of violence have taken a very heavy toll on the infrastructure. The province benefits from transfers of \u00a36 billion from the British Exchequer, but Northern Ireland has been unable to match the tax incentives which have brought foreign investors to the Republic and this will only change if the Treasury can be persuaded, by local politicians, that the province needs special consideration. </p> <p>Some of the problems remain outside the control of the local politicians, but many important decisions on funding for education, the environment, health and so on are being taken by local Ministers at Stormont. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, has warned that the flow of investment and economic benefits that have been a result of the Good Friday Agreement could slow down if the peace process continues to lurch from crisis to crisis. </p> <p>The emphasis in the media over the next few weeks, as unionists for and against the Belfast Agreement argue over Trimble's future, will be on bitterly divisive issues like policing and the handover of IRA weapons. Hospital closures, the threat to Belfast shipbuilders Harland &amp; Wolff and the debate on the 11+ exam will hardly rate a mention. These are issues of huge importance to most of the people in Northern Ireland, and they would like to see decisions on them being made by local politicians. That opportunity will be lost if the executive collapses.</p>",
  "The pong of incinerated Chanel No 5, acrid smoke and burnt lipstick, set off by a hint of piss, massages the nose as you approach the surrealist casualty of Belgrade's Perfume Revolution. The 'fragrance' deepens as you enter the shell of what was the Scandal Parfumerie owned by Marko Milosevic, son of the ex-president of Yugoslavia. Marko left Belgrade Airport yesterday morning at 08.40, bound for Moscow, trailing a terrible stench. <p>With him were his wife, bodyguards and son, also called Marko - the boy Slobodan Milosevic had told the nation in his waxwork-like resignation address that he wanted to spend more time with. </p> <p>Marko Milosevic's sudden flight is one visible sign of the frantic race going on behind the scenes even as President Vojislav Kostunica was formally anointed in office yesterday. </p> <p>The old regime is hurrying to hide the evidence of 13 years of corruption, while the new one is desperate to save the paper trails from destruction. The old regime is not fussy about its methods. The scent of death enveloped Marko's circle yesterday morning when his close friend and money launderer, Vladimir Bokan, 40, a Greek of Yugoslav origin, was gunned down by two unknown assassins in an Athens suburb. </p> <p>Greek police said the murder bore all the signs of a classic gangster hit. Bokan owned 1,500 kiosks in Yugoslavia, half of them in Belgrade - useful outlets, it is said, for Marko's cigarette racket. Whatever Bokan knew about Marko, he took to his grave. </p> <p>The state of Marko's perfume shop is a crying shame for those of us who care about fragrance. Underfoot, shards of glass snap, crackle and pop as you trample over tumbled shelves and advertising depicting sculpted hair, perfect belly buttons and impossibly puckered lips. The revolutionaries, who for some reason left the McDonald's up the road untouched, not only wrecked the perfumery, but daubed unflattering slogans on the walls: 'Daddy they smashed my shop!' 'Son of a whore, where are you?' and the pungent 'Fuck off Daddy!' </p> <p>Amid the broken glass and trampled ads are fragments of paperwork, hand-written in a flowing loopy script, lists of 'automatic eye-liner', 'invisible kiss lip' and 'bronze and shine' which is nothing to do with how Milosevic Senior used to run the state media. As we clambered out of the shop, a woman in shocking pink said: 'I was here yesterday. I am an accountant so I knew what to look for. I took away the account books and I will give them to the police.' When we asked her for her name she politely declined still fearing the possibility of retribution. But she did admit that 'Poison' was her favourite scent. </p> <p>'Poison' explained Marko's perfume racket: 'The perfume here, all the good foreign brands that people want, was around 30 per cent cheaper than the other shops.' An older man chipped in: 'No, 40, 50 per cent cheaper'. Poison continued: 'Marko didn't have to pay import duty on the perfume, so he made a fortune.' The account book showed that the name of the firm that owned the shop was 'Mambo' and the bank it used was the SDK Bank in New Belgrade. </p> <p>The books she found may help nail down exact amounts Marko stole from the state. But the 'scandal' perfumery was only the most visible showcase of Marko Milosevic's racketeering - a business that led, some say, to a turf war with celebrated Serbian ethnic cleanser and war criminal, Arkan, a battle that ended earlier this year when someone emptied 38 rounds into Arkan and his bodyguard outside a Belgrade hotel. </p> <p>Marko's cigarette racket was much more profitable than the perfume scam, said a source close to the Belgrade police. </p> <p>'Everyone has to pay a big import duty in foreign cigarettes, everyone but Marko. He imports the cigarettes duty free, and they are sold in Bokan's kiosks, so that they can control the price and distribution all the way down the line. It's a nice racket.' And then the source added: 'Funny that Bokan died this morning, isn't it?' </p> <p>More worrying for the Milosevic family may be the removal of the head of the Yugoslav Customs on Friday. The departure of Mikhail Kertes and his replacement by Dusan Zabunovic, a businessman loyal to president Kostunica, was witnessed by Yugoslavian journalists. </p> <p>Kertes' was markedly cold towards them, and they asked: 'Do you have a problem?' He replied: 'I don't have a problem with a handshake. I do have a problem with all of you.' </p> <p>Later the Free Television Service showed stacks of documents standing in front of shredding machines. Customs Officers loyal to the new government had prevented their loss in the nick of time. If some of those saved documents prove how Marko cheated the nation of tax revenue, there is a basis of a strong corruption case against him - which touches on his father, who may have permitted the fraud. </p> <p>Popular sentiment has turned against the Milosevic family. Marko's escape to Moscow has surprised few observers. The ugly mood towards him was growing potentially violent. </p> <p>Whereas Slobodan Milosevic, as ex-President, still enjoys a small measure of propriety due to the office he once held, his much-hated son has become a symbol of all the excesses of the old regime. </p> <p>Three days ago Marko and his family left Pozarevac, the Milosevics' home town, in three black jeeps. </p> <p>As he did, rioters looted his internet cafe and destroyed advertising for his disco Madonna. His nearby lurid Disney-esque theme park, Bambiland, has been closed since the summer, thanks to a popular boycott. </p> <p>Slobodan Milosevic's daughter, Maria, is less hated than Marko. But since the revolution, her TV station - which peddles a blend of film, pop and Stalinist loyalty to the regime - has dropped the latter. </p> <p>Few people see a future for the United Left of Marjana Markovic, Slobodan's wife. Her party was believed to be a source of slush money from corrupt businessmen in return for favours. There is a famous photograph of her with four businessmen. Three have been killed and one is in prison. </p> <p>The new president has repeatedly said that he does not recognise the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and would not send his predecessor there. </p> <p>But as his Customs investigators chase the paper trail, the popular feeling on the streets of Belgrade is that Marko Milosevic was a gangster who ripped people off and ordered the murders of anyone who got in his way may be backed by hard and sober evidence of corruption - evidence that may entrap the father with the son. Marko could not have got away with his racketeering without Daddy's protection - a reality which may yet confound Slobodan Milosevic's hopes of a political future in the new Yugoslavia. </p> <p>It would be an irony if Slobodan Milosevic, who started four wars leading to the deaths of more than 100,000 people, was finally caught for colluding in tax fraud - but that's how they got Al Capone. </p> <p>The only difference is that, while the Capone front was a flower shop, the Milosevic family have - sorry, had - a perfumery called Scandal.</p>",
  "<p>'The thing that makes the new British economy go is owner-occupied housing. We have found a way not only to get rich from our own houses, but perhaps even to live off them entirely in the future.' - The Guardian, 26 July 1985</p> <p>Fifteen years on and that theory lies in tatters. And in 2015, an enterprising researcher will no doubt search through newspaper archives to find out what fanciful notions we attached to the term 'new economy' embodied in the year of the millennium.</p> <p>And confusion is likely to overcome the mind of the archive searcher because the term defies any definition. It is used interchangeably to describe anything from increasing use of computing and internet technology to the growth of the information, knowledge and networked society, and to the emergence of a sustained growth yet low inflation economy in the US. Indeed some multinationals, mindful of the contamination of the 'globalisation' brand, now refer exclusively to the new economy instead. After all, certain groups may profess to be anti-globalisation, but how could anyone possibly be 'anti-new economy'?</p> <p>Amid this semantic muddle, a very real debate is emerging among economists and others about the cause, extent and novelty of what is termed the 'new economy', and whether talk of a British new economy is premature. Indeed, before the party gets off the ground outside the US, Business Week, the publication that lays claim to coining the concept, murmurs that it may soon be over.</p> <p>The first point is to separate cause from effect. Is it the successful economy that is new, or is it the industries that underpin it? </p> <p>The new economy has been described in terms of inputs - the new industries producing intangible, 'weightless' products such as IT, biotech, software and telecommunications; the application of new technology to improve productivity across the economy; and globalisation, the simple, costless diffusion of these techniques around the world. But it has also been described in terms of the perceived result of these trends - the creation in the US of an economy handling sustained growth in output and productivity without the spectre of inflation. In turn, this effect has been explained by phenomena other than technology, basically cheaper inputs. It's all down to the labour market, says Jack Triplett, of the Brookings Institution, while according to Andrew Oswald, of Warwick University, the new economy boom was a story of unfeasibly cheap energy, and the recent end of that trend spells doom.</p> <p>Supporters of such theses claim the role of technology in the ongoing US boom is overstated. The return on investment in this area is almost entirely contained within the IT producing sector, they say, and after accounting for cyclical factors, there is virtually no change in productivity in the other 88 per cent of the US economy. Put another way, the productivity growth in the US is fantastic, but given the sums of money invested, this should not be surprising.</p> <p>'It's mainly to do with the production of computers rather than their use,' says Ben Broadbent, an economist who has analysed the new economy extensively for Goldman Sachs. 'Hitherto, it's all been in electronics hardware production, where productivity has grown by up to 30 per cent a year. Subsequently views as to the future growth caused by B2B [business to business e-commerce], the internet and weightless products are mostly conjectural, but we're optimistic.' Goldman Sachs estimates that B2B will add 5 per cent to UK gross domestic product over the next decade. </p> <p>Economic growth can be considered a succession of 'new economies'. Capital investment is reallocated to dynamic sectors and sub-sectors at the expense of older sectors and they in turn produce fast growth. This economic darwinism is what causes trend growth - it just so happens that at the moment the favoured sectors are information, communications and technology (ICT). A genuinely new economy would reflect a broader shift, where use rather than production in new industries causes a stepchange in productivity across all sectors.</p> <p>Externalities, those returns on investments that can't be measured in simple economic terms, are crucial in this context. The key example is network externalities. Their intangible effect on an economy is captured by Metcalfe's Law. This says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users, because of the number of potential connections between network users. Such arguments have emboldened investors in these areas.</p> <p>Others argue that the effect of instant internet networks compared with those that require a contacts book and a telephone is negligible. For example, that B2B is nothing more than a small technical advancement on existing supply chain management systems. Such analysis is the realm of conjecture and counter-conjecture. </p> <p>'A lot of the benefits of the ICT revolution are not going to be measured by the conventional economic statistics,' says Garry Young of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research - for example, the ability to receive the latest football results on a mobile phone. Despite this productivity, figures will prove the acid test of any new economic revolution. But these are notoriously flaky and, since the shift from manufacturing to services in the 1980s, productivity has been increasingly tricky to track. There is little to suggest an effect of the new economy in overall UK and European productivity figures. Until this year UK figures for labour productivity growth were actually falling.</p> <p>The irony is that if the sceptics are right, the new economy boom in the US is very much a tale of manufacturing, albeit of the hi-tech sort. There is a danger that in trying to mimic that boom by focusing on weightless intangibles we may throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p> <p>As for monetary policy, there are doves on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe we are on the cusp of a leap in productivity which increases the capacity of the economy to expand without raising inflation. 'Some say that it allows you to have lower interest rates because the economy does not reach its speed limits as quickly,' says Young. </p> <p>But there is a more general problem, says US economist Robert Shiller in the context of overvalued stock markets. If we overstate the returns to the new economy then there is a danger that at the macro level, society allocates too many resources to the dotcom dodos of the future, and not enough to other priorities. The \u00a3100 million spent funding Boo.com, was \u00a3100m lost investment in, for example, genomics or photonics, two areas in which the UK could lead the world. Even the new economy has an opportunity cost.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:faisal.islam@observer.co.uk\">faisal.islam@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Revolutions follow their own timetable. Euphoria follows anger before the sobering reality sets in that nation-building - and rebuilding - can be more onerous and painful for the people than bringing down dictators. There can be no denying the courage of the Serbs as they took to the streets to remove from office the man who has dragged them through a decade of disasters. The euphoria that surrounded Slobodan Milosevic's removal as head of the Yugoslav state still lingers, but yesterday, as the country's new President, Vojislav Kostunica, took his oath of office, the ghosts of a decade of Balkan conflict gathered for the feast. <p>The problems that face the Serbs, their partners in Yugoslavia, and the international community are not ones that will be easily resolved. Serbia's economy is in ruins. Its people remain battered and alienated after a decade of wars and sanctions. Territorial issues in Montenegro, Kosovo and the Bosnian Serb republic remain unresolved. Amid all this, Kostunica remains an unknown quantity - a Serb nationalist who has yet to demonstrate how he will balance his conflicting appeal to a strong national identity, encompassing the Bosnian and Kosovar Serbs, with a reformed, democratic Yugoslavia participating in the business of Europe. </p> <p>More pressing is the spectre of Milosevic, threatening to continue in an active role in politics. Already it seems clear that the potential for him to undermine the new government is great. For while Kostunica will control the federal parliament, Milosevic's Socialist Party looks certain to hold the balance of power in the lower Serbian parliament, which would act as a conduit for him to continue his destructive influence. </p> <p>While the case is strong for swift moves from the international community to lift sanctions and release funds for Serbia's reconstruction to shore up Kostunica's move towards democracy, that process cannot be completed while an indicted war criminal has any share in power. Equally pressing for the international community is that it clarifies the nature of Kostunica's nationalist agenda, which contains considerable potential for further tension in the region, especially over the status of Kosovo, which Kostunica has vowed never to surrender. The temptation for a wholesale lifting of sanctions against Serbia should be resisted until both Milosevic's position and Kostunica's agenda have become clearer. </p> <p>The international community shares the blame for many of the fatal mistakes of the last 10 years over Milosevic's wars that saw 300,000 die. Now it has the opportunity to redress some of these errors and contribute to a lasting peace within the region. It must avoid a hasty rush to judgment.</p>"
