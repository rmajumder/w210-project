  "Only two \"fresh start\" schools have improved their GCSE results this year - proof, the Conservatives claimed last night, that the scheme has failed. <p>Three schools which saw their headteachers quit within five days of each other in March performed worse than last year. </p> <p>Firfield community school, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, had 4% of its pupils achieving five or more A*-Cs, compared with 9% last year. It is due to close next year. Results at East Brighton college of media arts fell from 20% to 13%, and Islington arts and media school, which reopened to a great fanfare after a \u00a34m refit, plummeted from 17% to 6%, even lower than the gloomy predictions of its governors. </p> <p>Under the fresh start programme, failing schools reopen with a new name and headteacher. There are currently 11 secondary schools and five primary schools in the scheme. Another nine are joining this term. </p> <p>Fir Vale school in Sheffield, visited by the education secretary, David Blunkett, last week, increased the number of candidates achieving five or more A*-Cs from 11% to 17%. Bishopsford in Morden, south London, boosted its results by one point. The top performing fresh start school, the Kings CE school in Wolverhampton, was bought by the church in 1998 and, though it had problems attracting pupils, did not have as poor a record on results in the first place. </p> <p>Theresa May, the shadow education secretary, said: \"Fresh start has been a failure right from the start. This survey proves headteachers could not turn their schools around because of the restraints they are under from Whitehall.\" </p> <p>Fresh start schools are to receive an extra \u00a3400,000 in government money over two years as the department for education seeks to exert more control over the programme. Mr Blunkett was unhappy about some of the head-teacher appointments in the first two years of fresh start. </p> <p>Before leaving for a visit to Canada, Mr Blunkett said: \"In the next three or four years we have budgeted to put resources into fresh start where the alternative would be closure or gradual death. You can let a school die, and there are advocates from the right who believe in letting market forces operate. But the victims of that are the kids who remain there until the school literally dies on its feet. And those are the kids who have been abandoned, and they end up being the ones who are on our streets at the age of 16.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tell a story about Jeanette Winterson. Once there was a girl with a gift. This girl sprang from nowhere. Nowhere taught few niceties to its daughters, and the journey elsewhere had made her tough, so when her gift drew fame and fortune she couldn't respond in the proper way. She wasn't grateful. She was proud. And worst of all, she loved her gift so intensely that she made the mistake of assuming others would love it for its own sake. Instead, they burned her. </p> <p>Begin again. Once there was a girl with an ego. She made a fuss about where she came from (this girl was working class). She believed her writing could save the world (this girl was a megalomaniac). In fact, it was pretentious and undisciplined (this girl called herself an artist). She was cruel, controlling and sexually manipulative (this girl was a lesbian). And as her work sagged with self-indulgence, the ego became more monstrous still, until she burnt out. </p> <p>Tell a truth about Jeanette Winterson. She doesn't foster indifference. But the truth is many-minded, and the easiest facts mislead. Where does she end and the story around her begin? How does reputation happen? </p> <p>\"It's no secret that the 90s weren't a great decade for me, so maybe that's why I'm glad they're gone,\" says Winterson, neat and tiny in the parlour of the east London house she renovated from derelict, and which remains her occasional city base.</p> <p>\"If you come through that with your joy returned to you... \" the phrase tangles, and she pauses. It's jarring - she normally speaks demandingly swiftly, in complete and perfectly grammatical sentences. The period she is describing with such elliptical rawness followed the publication of Art And Lies, her sixth novel, in 1994. Almost a decade after the rapturous reception of her debut, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, in 1985, the primacy of Winterson's image was swiftly outflanking her own modernist agenda of the primacy of the text. The evangelical fervour of her childhood, which she used as a basis for Oranges, had transmuted into an absurd, messianic self-belief in adulthood, it was said. </p> <p>The exuberance and experimentalism of The Passion (1987) and Sexing The Cherry (1989) were soon subsumed within her own weighty prophesies. In the 1991 introduction to Orange's reissue with publishers Vintage, she dismissed the notion that hers was straightforward semi-autobiography: \"[it is] an experimental novel: its interests are anti-linear. It offers a complicated narrative structure disguised as a simple one, it employs a very large vocabulary and a beguilingly straightforward syntax... Oranges is a threatening novel.\" Meanwhile, she was demanding chauffeur-driven transport on book tours, and declaring herself the natural heir to Virginia Woolf in a Late Show special on TV. </p> <p>She next told a tabloid interviewer that the relationship in 1992's Written On The Body was based on her own affair with her married agent, outing the woman in question. She then nominated that book as her Book Of The Year in a Sunday newspaper, and the following year nominated herself as her favourite living author. She \"sacked\" a close friend, apparently because she felt that her high-profile position in the media was corrupting her. </p> <p>Having left her British agent, she formed her own company to look after her UK interests, and surrounded herself with a \"coven\" of close female friends, including her partner, the broadcaster and academic Margaret Reynolds, who left her husband for Winterson. In 1994, following the publication of Art And Lies, she doorstepped a journalist who had written a critical profile of her, in which she suggested that her splendid isolation was affecting her writing.</p> <p>She was outrageous; her sins writ large, time and again, from the monolith of the cuttings file, ego without irony, action without context. Nor was she safely outrageous. Winterson may have invited a sharp response with her swank and insensitivity, but the judgment that followed bit far deeper - at her eccentric lifestyle, her sexuality, her unfeminine choices, her humourless determination to take her work seriously. The backlash was ferocious, her next two fiction works greeted with blanket hostility and ridicule. </p> <p>\"It's one of the reasons I left London [to live in Gloucestershire full-time, in 1994]. I wanted to retreat completely and find a different space for myself. It was a moment of transition, when I said, 'Am I going to go on, can I go on, is there any point going on?' And I thought I wouldn't for about two years. I couldn't write anything, couldn't do anything. I just carried on doing the only thing I could think of, which was reading books, listening to opera and going to look at pictures. I thought, 'This will heal me. I have my own medicine, and if I really believe in this as much as I say I do, I'll just have to wait for it to change its course.'\" </p> <p>She doesn't blame other people, she says evenly. \"I'm responsible as much as the press are. By the time the early 90s came, I'd done three books, won a Bafta, been published all over the world - there was bound to be trouble, and I didn't handle it well. I shouldn't have got as angry as I did. Criticism is not personal, it happens to everyone, but I didn't understand that. It keyed into all my own insecurities and anxieties, thinking that I shouldn't be here, this isn't what I'm meant for. Then, to defend yourself against that, you get caught in a kind of arrogance that says, 'No I am good enough, just fuck off.' You get very angry and defensive. I had a lot of rows with people.\" </p> <p>Begin again. \"I feel I've been waiting for the 21st century all my life.\" At the age of 41, Winterson - never knowingly lukewarm - hails cyberspace with a zealot's tongue. \"It feels exciting, risky, it just feels new. I love the web. I love email, I like the swiftness of it. It's always been an irritation to me that you can't communicate as swiftly as you can think. I love the thought that there are no obvious barriers between us, and I like the pretence of it.\" </p> <p>Winterson recently won a ruling against a Cambridge academic who had registered her domain name and those of other authors on the internet, and plans to launch her own website, in conjunction with the publication of her new novel, The.PowerBook.</p> <p>\"The domain name business was like being taken by the scruff of the neck and forced into a serious learning curve,\" she says. \"I've always had the philosophy, because it's been true for me, that no matter how bad a thing is, some good will come out of it for yourself. If it hadn't happened, maybe I'd have been slower on the uptake. Where it will end, I don't know. I imagine I'll probably do everything on it eventually.\" Is it easier to dissemble in cyberspace? \"Oh yes!\" She twists her adolescent frame around the chair excitedly. Dressed in black and white, with wire hair and fussless face, she is less mannish than femininity-free. \"The potential for trouble is high,\" she adds with relish. \"But also I think the sense of the expanding self is exciting, the thought that you're not locked into the way you look, the way you talk, your social position, even your gender. You can play with all those things in a way that can be quite liberating.\" </p> <p>The.PowerBook does just that. The story of an e-writing lover and her (married) lass, it is threaded with Winterson's usual high concerns - the nature of time, love and gender, the knightly quest for the grail and the journey that maps it - but pulls back from the grandiose involution of her recent work. Hyper-eloquence at bay, her lean reworkings of Written On The Body and Oranges anchor denser references to TS Eliot, Woolf and Dante, while fluent contemporary characterisation balances archetype. Language remains beloved, but is no longer fetishised. </p> <p> The.PowerBook, she says, brings together everything she has done so far: the story and the language, the linear and the multiple. \"I'm trying to do it all, and nobody can, but I don't mind. I don't want to read a page of print which is really just printed television, or where the words aren't doing the work.\" This is her journey. \"I love 19th century fiction, but I don't want to read reproductions. If we're not moving fiction forward, we're not doing anything with it. And if art's not moving forward, it ceases to be connected to the past. You have to risk failing. Nobody expects science to stay in the same place, but everybody moans like fuck when people start doing new things in art.\" </p> <p>There is no such thing as autobiography, she wrote in a previous novel, there's only art and lies. What's the difference? \"I believe in art as the true means of not telling the truth. You're not setting out to deceive. You're setting out to find an ultimate reality. Lies are just lies. They're deceptions that you create for yourself or others, and most of us live our life in a lie from beginning to end, because it's comfortable. What art tries to do is cut through all that and come up with something that really is objective, and which is trying all at once to deal with the mundane tables-and-chairs world of the everyday and also with imaginative and psychic worlds which we know are there and which we so often split off. </p> <p>\"I try not to tell lies to people I love, and I try not to tell lies where it matters, but I will sacrifice a fair bit of fact if I can tell a good story,\" she laughs. \"It's being lashed to facts that I'm not interested in. I want the elbow room. It's not just the stories you make up yourself, it's the stories people make up about you. Never mind being a character in your own book, you become a character in your own life. All of that you weave in yourself, and you stop minding about it. I've come to see the whole thing now as one giant story, which I'm sometimes in control of but mostly not.\" </p> <p>Life's the messy bit, she says, art is where we have the chance of getting it right. Experience through art is as important as anything that happens in life. In The.PowerBook, a storyteller weaves himself into his stories: \"What he is, what he invents, becomes part of the same story...\" Does she filter her own life through her writing? \"I do. Otherwise [the emotions] are in an inchoate condition where they're not much use to me and they're certainly no use to anybody else. It's only by endlessly filtering and refining, like pushing water through limestone to extract the impurities, that you're left with the emotion which then becomes useful to other people as well as to yourself.\" Art and life, she says, are completely intertwined. </p> <p>But whose life? While she accepts that art is not classless, she appears to be more concerned with the effort people make with it than the access they have to it. And she demands that effort from those who read her, as well as their submission. Nothing has changed since the tease she set down in her third novel, The Passion: \"I'm telling you stories. Trust me.\"</p> <p>Winterson is often accused of showing contempt for her readers and, by extension, contempt for the ordinary, of lacking imaginative empathy with the everyday, and preferring to explore her own rarefied vision than the world around her. She doesn't like it when people don't try, she responds. \"I'm not interested in laziness, sloppiness, or bad manners. Sometimes that makes people cross. But I really care about this art business. I can't take it anything but seriously. It's everything to me. But I have no contempt for ordinary people. I'm not a middle-class wanker. I've made myself into what I am, because it's what I wanted to be. I am convinced that if anyone wants to make that effort, then all these things are as open to them as they are to me.\" It's rigidly Old Testament, as well as deeply Thatcherite. It also exhibits a strange kind of generosity for a woman so self-consciously self-made. </p> <p>She tells me later that she voted for Thatcher in 1979, when she had just been accepted to Oxford University. \"She really believed that everyone could pull themselves together if they were given the opportunity. I'd just got into Oxford, and I thought, 'Of course, working-class kid gets in, it'll all be like this now.' But I don't think that now,\" she acknowledges, contradicting her earlier brimstone on the primacy of effort. (This happens a couple of times during our conversation, when she gets carried away with the joy of a thought, a delicious yarn, or a fervent rant, and dances over rigour. Or is she just teasing the truth?) She now accepts that ability also plays its part in achievement. \"But I still don't think that's any excuse for general laziness,\" she nips. </p> <p>Naturally, she is ambitious for her work, she says. \"I want it to be really good. I have to be able to hold my head up, I have to feel that I'm doing the very best that I can. It doesn't matter to me how other people think it measures up. You have to set those high standards. You have to care about it.\" Later in the conversation, she adds that it will be another 20 years before anyone can judge whether her work is worthwhile. \"If it's good, it'll last the course, if it's not good, let it go. I think that the work I'm doing is making a difference, but in the end everybody else has got to be the judge of that.\" Is this another reckless contradiction, or does she trust the judgment of the future more than that of the present? \"I'll be satisfied. It's worked for me. This is the life I wanted. I'm very lucky. I don't know what it'll look like in the end, but I intend to live a very long time so I can see. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I feel I've done something really good and I'm pleased,\" she says. \"Other times I look at it and I can see all the gaps but I can't do anything about it. I'm pleased with The.PowerBook. It was hard to do, and it fulfils the goals that I set for myself.\" She trails off. \"I hate talking about this because people always misinterpret it as vanity.\" </p> <p>Would you like her to be simply vain? Can you hear the phrases stressed with vulnerability as clearly as those delivered with swagger? She loves words. Her love is ruthless, romantic, not nice. It is complex, and so is she. </p> <p> Born near Manchester, in 1959, Winterson was the adopted daughter and only child of Elim Pentecostalists, a fringe evangelical church which teaches every word of the Bible to be literally true. Her father was a factory worker, her mother a housewife, who raised the young Jeanette to be a missionary. Her extraordinary childhood - culturally void, emotionally sterile, obscenely Godly - forms the basis of the Whitbread Prize-winning Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, which she later adapted for the BBC. At the age of 16, she was publicly denounced by her church after they discovered that she was having a lesbian affair. She left home, took A-levels at a local technical college, and supported herself doing odd jobs, before going to St Catherine's College, Oxford, to study English. </p> <p>The portrait of her adoptive mother in Oranges is neither cruel nor kind, it is loveless but tempered with an odd, accommodating respect. When I ask a question about her mother, I am immediately corrected. \"Mrs Winterson?\" She stares at me, daring shock. She has vivid eyes. \"It was never going to work between us. I don't know what fate put me with her, or her with me, but at least I was able to use all that and make something of it. Whereas for her it was just purgatory. She was a very unhappy woman. And I was a happy child. In a way, the battle between us was the battle between happiness and unhappiness.\"</p> <p>The language is clean, disconnected. The woman who brought her up is character, translated into archetype, and not felt. Mrs Winterson, estranged from Jeanette since she left home, died soon after the television screening of Oranges. She was reportedly devastated by the portrayal of her daughter's childhood. Does Winterson feel any guilt for that now? \"No,\" lobs back, with teenage challenge. Nor does she regret hurting her adoptive father, with whom she continues to correspond occasionally. \"You can't have regrets. I wanted it to be made, and I think it's good, and you can't not do things because one person's not going to like it. That would be ruthlessness I suppose. </p> <p>\"But also, remember one of the things she was particularly miffed about was that she thought it was all not true, but I never said it was true anyway.\" She laughs at her cleverness. It's an ugly moment. \"Oranges isn't autobiography. It's a way of using yourself and the past to create a fiction around all of that. When Paul Auster and Milan Kundera put themselves in their work it's called metafiction, when I do it it's autobiography.\" Art and life, completely intertwined. In the circumstances, I doubt if Mrs Winterson cared about metafiction. Art and life, a literary term in the feelings gap. </p> <p>The Wintersons, or their metafictitious representations, resurface in The.PowerBook as Mr and Mrs Muck, the parents of the narrator. The passages detailing their relationship have none of the diverting bravado of Oranges. They are flayed raw. \"I stopped being angry a long time ago,\" she says. \"But it's all still there. When I was writing stuff in The.Powerbook, I was a bit surprised. It had to come out.\" Her buttery Lancashire vowels draw tight. \"It was about settling an old score as well. Oranges had become so mythologised, even to the absurd point where people would say how lucky I was to have such a childhood. I needed to write something one more time about the particular kind of pain that was there.\" </p> <p>In the new novel, she also writes achingly for the first time about her birth mother. \"I was working in Cornwall at the time, I had a high fever and I was on my own. All this stuff was coming up, and I thought, 'You can let go of this.' And it was letting everything go. It was from that time, in March 1999, that I really felt the bad period [since Art And Lies] was over. That was the end of it. The fever went, I got up, wrote all that stuff down much as you read it now. I thought, 'Good, I think I've got to the bottom of the heap here', and went home.\" </p> <p>She has never attempted to contact her birth mother. \"It would be a huge mistake. She made the choice she did. I've been in the public eye, and she knows what my name is. Some things are over before they start. Family life is a bit of a mystery to me. I don't understand it. I have no experience of such feelings, so I'm pretty sure I haven't got them. Clearly, family life isn't for me. Maybe it's what keeps me focused, and in the early days what kept me ruthless. Because you have to be ruthless to fight your way up. I didn't have to worry about anyone. I didn't feel I owed anybody anything. Once I left home, I thought, 'I'm on my own, I always have been in effect, and now I have to get on with it and make it happen.'\" </p> <p>There is human sadness here, no matter how she words it as indifference. There is ugliness and randomness that she will re-write as beauty and control, for herself, for her readers. What could family life have taught her? Without the lesson, she writes for belonging, for certainties, to make herself new and to keep herself all her own work. </p> <p>Yet, despite this uncharacteristic deferral to circumstance, her emotional life is hardly void. Her friends all employ the same descriptives: difficult, loyal, worth it. \"I give a lot, but I demand a lot,\" says Winterson. \"I suppose because I never had a family as such, my friends are my family. So all the things you would expect in a family circle, where people really go at it but know that they really love each other, is what happens to me with my friends. I've lost friends, there are some that I regret and that are totally my fault. There have been times in my life when I've just wanted everything different, and I've walked away. And that's hard.\" </p> <p>What violence must that singular quest for renewal do to softer hearts? In Winterson legend, sexually she was ever the Casanova, particularly where married women were concerned. She is not a pretty thing, nor is she superficially flirtatious, but one can imagine the force of her, the desire to be drawn into her, must be compulsive. </p> <p> There is a yarn about Winterson involving saucepans. In 1997, to much attendant media moistness, she divulged that, when she first arrived in London as a boyish twentysomething, she serviced frustrated married women from the Home Counties in hotel rooms off Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. Having minimal access to the hard stuff, they paid her in Le Creuset. </p> <p>The hilarity - of the story, of the telling of the story - tickles her still. \" That was funny. It got blown up out of all proportion, but it was such a good story!\" The kernel is true, she concedes, before adding, tantalisingly, \"and I do have an awful lot of pans. Even now, if we get a big one with risotto stuck to the bottom, I say to Peggy, 'You've no idea how hard I had to work for that, and look what you've done to it...' - and I get biffed. It got all dressed up as lesbian prostitution, which it really wasn't. It was simply to do with a very strange and particular time which couldn't happen now, with ladies leading double lives. I was very young. They just wanted to buy me presents, and I needed cookware.\" </p> <p>As in her art, so in her life, married women have appeared frequently. \"I've always had a strange attraction to and for them. I think it's a kind of pleasure and danger thing.\" Did it stem from a fear of involvement on her part? There is no lover so tempting to the commitment-phobe as the already-partnered partner. \"No, I hate it. I mind subterfuge. I made it clear to Peggy that I couldn't get involved with her while she was married [the pair have now been together for 11 years]. She had to leave for her own reasons, and I wasn't promising to be there. Which is a bit brutal, but I'd had enough of all that. Peggy left and found me again. I thought that was incredibly brave and completely honest. It's actually the only proper way to proceed.\" </p> <p>Her sense of the proper is endearing, her lust for control confronting. She sets up the sexual, and therefore gendered, choices in her life like ladder rungs. \"Kids don't leave home at 16 because they've fallen in love with another girl. That's a big either/or choice. But I wanted that more than I wanted any of the other things that were on offer. I don't put stability and comfort very high up the list anyway, they're not worth sacrificing anything for. So I suppose I became a conscious sexual being, thinking I'd made a choice for another person that I desired early on, and that continued, because it was a way of understanding myself and who I was, and of laying claim to the world. It was about power, but not about power over other people. I wanted power over myself, and I used sex to find that. It told me who I was in a very straightforward way. I went through boys, girls, at random and whenever I could, because I just thought the more the better.\" </p> <p>Lesbianism is another choice, she tells me. \"It's very fashionable at the moment to say that everything is genetic, but it's a choice that I made quite consciously. I don't have any problems going to bed with men, don't dislike it, don't dislike them. I could choose, and with women I was able to get on with my life and do my work, and I'm not sure that I would have been able to do that if I'd been heterosexual. I feel like I didn't make a problem for myself, I made a solution. I knew I never wanted any kids. It would take up all my time because I would have to do it properly. </p> <p>\"Femininity is a construct,\" she continues, \"and I don't trust it. I think it's still difficult for women to be themselves in the way that men can, without any regard for what's happening around them. There is still that self-consciousness in women, that they are women, which is hampering. It's very difficult to do good work if you're self-conscious. It's not arrogance, it's straightforward single-mindedness, which people accept in men.\" </p> <p>Tell a truth about Jeanette Winterson. She divides like Moses and the Red Sea. Phoning round for context before I met her, I had never encountered such definitives: a sociopath, a seducer, fiercely loyal, impossibly demanding, a bitch, a blessing. For so many certainties, she must be a mystery. I was warned: she'll flirt, she'll charm, she'll give you what you want.</p> <p>So who did I meet? A brilliant child, compelling and easily bored, who one is moved to protect. A woman for whom self is absolute, keen and knowingly dissembling, who has found her place of safety behind the words. No comfort, no coward. She must be a bugger to love. She's probably worth it. Older now, more even, she is delighted by her life: her horses and her haybales, country domesticity and her beautiful woman, though she teases that she may take a mistress in the future \"now that the 40s are the new 30s\". She'll never know when to stop.</p> <p>In The PowerBook, she writes: \"In this life you have to be your own hero. By that I mean you have to win whatever it is that matters to you by your own strength and in your own way.\"</p> <p>Tell a story about Jeanette Winterson.

  "<p>AJP Taylor was a student in Vienna in 1933 when he was introduced to Margaret Adams, an English girl studying the piano. She came from a rich, upper-middle-class, Roman Catholic family - and had been educated in an English convent, from which she was attempting to emancipate herself. </p> <p>She was small, musical, with a yen for literature, although she was not intellectual, or at least not academic; as Taylor later - inaccurately - stated, \"no intellectual woman attracted me sexually\". They attended concerts together and fell in love. Taylor \"worried about the future, doubtful whether her religious or family background would consort with mine. She had no such doubts.\" </p> <p>He came back to England in 1930 to take up a post at Manchester university, but he had encouraged Margaret to return to Vienna to continue her piano studies: \"Being full of cranky ideas of marriage, concocted from the writings of Wells and Shaw,\" he wrote, \"I believed that every woman should have a career\", and something to do with the piano was apparently Margaret's destiny. It was also his way of putting off any decision. </p> <p>In 1931, Taylor moved to London to work on his first book. Margaret was also in London and, according to Taylor, \"it seemed to me that we must either marry or break. I was reluctant to do either.\" He decided to broach the question and Margaret agreed to marry him. They set up house in Manchester. Her passion for music had continued, and this formed a strong link between them. He had a subscription to the evening concerts of the Halle: now they both went. Margaret continued her studies; within a few years she was playing early music on the clavichord. She persuaded Philip Godlee, chairman of the Halle Orchestra, to start the Manchester Chamber Concerts Society. She was its secretary, and as a result of her determination, Manchester had the opportunity to hear all of the greatest quartets of the day. </p> <p>The couple's move to Oxford in 1938, to enable Taylor to take up a post as fellow and tutor in modern history at Magdalen College, deprived them of the music; and it also deprived Margaret of an absorbing avocation, with devastating results for the marriage. From mid-1940, Taylor's private life was pain and misery because of Margaret's infatuations, first with Robert Kee and then with Dylan Thomas; the eventual outcome was divorce. </p> <p>Taylor thought that the origin of Margaret's passion for Kee was a holiday in 1939. Taylor was 33, Margaret younger, their son Giles aged two. Kee, then 19, was handsome, desired by both sexes, by rumour experienced sexually, clever and interesting. He was one of Taylor's favourite undergraduates, and Taylor never blamed him for what happened. </p> <p>The historian took his family and their nanny, Henrietta Kotlan, to Savoy that summer and Kee was among the visitors who came to stay. Taylor worked every morning on his book The Habsburg Monarchy, while Margaret spent time with Kee. When they all took walks together, she and Kee strode ahead and were quickly out of sight. According to Kotlan, Margaret \"was already in love\" with Kee before the holiday: \"She was a very sweet, rather helpless creature with this falling in love all the time. But she couldn't help it... even I noticed that she lost interest in Giles.\" Taylor thought nothing of it, but when they returned to Oxford, things developed: he said \"Margaret was falling passionately, unrestrainedly in love\" with Kee. She harassed him in his lodgings, thrusting herself physically on him. </p> <p>Taylor eventually found out about her obsession. \"It puzzled me that Robert became increasingly reluctant to come to the house... One day, picking up the extension telephone in my room, I heard Robert say to Margaret: 'You know it is impossible for me to come to the theatre with you. I am sending the tickets back.' All became clear to me. I understood why Margaret hung about in the hall when she thought Robert might be coming to see me and why she grew listless at evening parties when he failed to appear.\" </p> <p>Kee left Oxford in 1940 to join the Royal Air Force and Margaret, distraught, followed him to his camp. She tried to make contact with him and he had to warn the guard against her, cowering in the camp until he was certain that she had left. He became a bomber pilot and was finally out of reach. Things settled down for the Taylors, but one evening they went to see the film Brief Encounter. Taylor later wrote he \"was speechless with agony and walked home feeling as though I were dead. Margaret merely complained that I was rather silent. It was the bitterest moment of my troubled life.\" </p> <p>Kee was shot down and became a prisoner of war. At Margaret's urging, Taylor wrote to him regularly, which he did \"more for his sake than for hers\". Things were still wrong, as Taylor discovered when there were signs that the war would soon be over. \"Margaret listened to every new bulletin on the wireless with passionate concentration. I realised she was thinking all the time of Robert. My hopes and illusions fell from me.\" </p> <p>In July 1945 Margaret asked to travel to London with her husband, only later revealing that Kee was back in the country and would be coming for a drink. \"We waited miserable and restless until after 10 when I went to bed. Robert appeared when I was already asleep. Margaret told Robert that our room was available for him if he wanted it. Nothing had changed. When I thought Margaret had been setting up the London room for me, she had been preparing it for Robert and planning all along for him to move in. Thus I lost both my London room and my peace of mind.\" </p> <p>Kee began to visit their house in Oxford. But Margaret was soon to be thrown over. When Kee invited the Taylors to dinner in London. He seemed restless, watching the restaurant door. Taylor remembered: \"Suddenly he said, 'Here she is' and introduced us to Janetta, already twice married and soon to marry Robert, who had soon wearied of [Margaret's] attentions. Time and again [she] tried to take Robert unawares. Robert complained to me. He complained to others and Margaret's infatuation became the common talk of Oxford, or so I thought. I felt humiliated and resentful. My last spark of affection for Margaret was extinguished.\" </p> <p> In the autumn of 1946, Dylan and Caitlin Thomas turned up on the Taylors' doorstep. Dylan had been an unwelcome visitor before, and Taylor disliked him intensely. He stayed for a month, not for just a week or two. He drank on a monumental scale, 15 or 20 pints of beer a day which created a problem: Taylor kept a barrel in the house and did not intend to provide a constant supply for Thomas, so he tried to ration him. They had little in common: they did not share any literary interests, and Thomas did not like walking. He was a sponger. When he left, he told Taylor that he had lost the return half of his railway ticket, which Taylor thought a lie, and asked Taylor to lend him a couple of pounds. Taylor recalled he said: \" 'I lend once and, unless repaid, once only.' Thomas did not repay the money. But this did not matter. I never expected to see Dylan again.\" </p> <p>But here he was, this time with a wife, Caitlin, perhaps even more rambunctious. They were homeless and Margaret took pity on them, letting them take up residence in the summerhouse in the garden. \"Dylan tried to borrow money from me, in which he did not succeed,\" said Taylor. \"Thomas would go off to London to give a radio talk and spend the fee on drink. Then there would be a row with Caitlin. Dylan would cajole her in a wheedling Welsh voice, and Caitlin would succumb.\" </p> <p>Margaret gave parties for them, introducing Thomas to literary circles around Oxford and even inducing Taylor to take him to dine at Magdalen High Table. Taylor records that he remarked to Caitlin that Margaret often appeared unbalanced, because she imagined that she was in love with Robert Kee. Caitlin's reply was: \"Oh, no. she makes out that now she is in love with Dylan.\" Taylor, not surprisingly, was depressed at the prospect that there would be no end to Margaret's infatuations. She grew more obsessed with Thomas, turning herself into his patroness and the Taylors ended up paying for the Thomases' accommodation until the poet's death in 1953. </p> <p>In the autumn of 1947, Margaret found Dylan and Caitlin the Manor House in South Leigh, 10 miles west of Oxford. According to Taylor, he paid about \u00a32,000 for it, on condition that Margaret stop giving them money (a condition she failed to fulfil) and that they paid rent (which they hardly ever did). They moved in in September. Margaret was pleased because its relative closeness meant that she could keep an eye on Thomas. She bicycled out frequently, as did Taylor; according to Thomas, writing to Caitlin, it was hell, with Margaret lecturing about art and Taylor making scenes on the road. Taylor was getting desperate. Reports reached him that Thomas \"was boasting around the Oxford pubs that he had got the wife of a rich don hooked\". </p> <p>Margaret had inherited money when her mother died in 1941. She spent some of it on pictures: a Sickert, a Degas, a Renoir, a Utrillo. They began to disappear along with crystal decanters and the piano. \"I might not have minded so much if it had not been for Dylan's boasting,\" recalled Taylor. The composer Elizabeth Lutyens was supposed to have heard Thomas say: \"I'll have to see if I can squeeze Maggie's left breast and get some money.\" </p> <p>By May 1948 the Thomases were tired of South Leigh: Thomas had convinced himself that he could only write good poetry if he once again lived in South Wales. Margaret had to agree. According to a friend of Caitlin, Margaret had \"visions of returning with them, and setting up a threesome\". Caitlin claimed that Margaret wrote to Thomas that \"going to bed with you would be like going to bed with a god\". Thomas had originally encouraged Margaret to write verse, sending her long critiques, seeming to take it seriously. Later he was cruel. According to Caitlin, \"she and Dylan were standing in a bar, laughing about poor old Maggs behind her back, when they realised she was there, listening to them, the tears streaming down her mortified face\". </p> <p>After the couple moved to Wales, Caitlin wrote to a friend about a visit from Margaret: \"It ended as usual, with floods of tears and recriminations, and heliotrope changes of colour, on the main street, on a Sunday, after a few harsh words of truth from Dylan. And she had been so sweet and diplomatic until then. Ebie [Williams, a taxi driver] was simply terrified taking her to the station, clutching a basket of spilling underclothes, and soiled intimacies, her blue hair straggling wildly over her face, her lipstick streaking dangerously down her neck; and the wail of a lost banshee pursuing him to the ends of the earth.\" </p> <p>The house was the Boat House at Laugharne, which Thomas had coveted in his youth. When it came on the market, Margaret sold the Manor House, and with the proceeds bought it for \u00a33,000, two-thirds of her remaining capital, plus a further \u00a3136 for repairs to the roof and verandah. In 1949 the Thomases moved in. They were supposed to pay rent, although it was difficult for Margaret to extract it; that scene described by Caitlin took place after Margaret insisted that they pay her \u00a32 a week for seven years. </p> <p>Taylor was fed up. He wrote to Thomas that he was destroying their marriage and that he should lay off, if only for the sake of the children; Thomas never replied. With Kee, Margaret had sometimes been away for days; now it was happening again. Taylor recalled that often, coming back from London to their Oxford home, \"I found Holywell Ford deserted except for the children and our resident domestic\". Mar garet had broken her promise not to give the Thomases money: Taylor was intensely unhappy about that. </p> <p>It is unknown to what extent Margaret's passions were consummated. Taylor referred later to her \"wild love affairs\"; but he always said that Kee acted honourably, while Caitlin's temper and ferocious possessiveness would have led her to attack Margaret had she suspected that Margaret and Thomas were sleeping together. </p> <p>By 1950, Taylor decided that they should separate. He had asked for, and received, the promise of a sabbatical, which he proposed to spend in London, researching and writing The Struggle For Mastery In Europe. Margaret had suggested that Taylor should lease a house near Regent's Park in London and let their house in Oxford.The Taylors spent the whole summer in Oxford, \"enjoying a family life at Holywell Ford for perhaps the last time . . . we packed up and moved to Park Village East. I settled Margaret in her house there and moved to a flat elsewhere. This was the end of my full family life for many years to come.\"</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from Troublemaker: The Life and History of AJP Taylor by Kathleen Burk is published by Yale University Press at \u00a319.95.

  "<p>This year Scandinavia has changed its relation to the rest of the world. The \u00d6resund bridge, opened this summer, links Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6; the significance of the sea dividing Sweden and Norway from Denmark and mainland Europe has thus been diminished. \"Sweden is a beached unrigged ship\", wrote the country's greatest living poet, Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer, pointing up an island quality - an independence from the problems and decrees of elsewhere. </p> <p>But in fact the \u00d6resund bridge (bitterly resented by many, particularly ecologists) is the culmination of a long debate that became, in these famously consensual societies, all the fiercer as the 90s progressed: just how European are - or should be - the Scandinavian countries? During the last decade Sweden voted to join the EU, as did Finland; Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty in one referendum and accepted it in a second, while Norway decided to stay out. This last result was determined not by the south-facing capital, Oslo, but by the north's stubborn traditionalist communities. </p> <p>Throughout Scandinavia there has been an increasing feeling that it is the northern regions, with their vast tracts of wilderness, that give the culture its distinctive definition. The Swedish novel of the 90s was Kerstin Ekman's wonderful Blackwater (Vintage, \u00a36.99), a huge critical and popular success.</p> <p>A young woman prepared to view everything through the rosy spectacles of the 1970s Green Wave comes to a remote northern community. Within an hour of her arrival she has stumbled across the victims of a brutal murder: two hitchhikers, both foreigners, hacked to death in their lakeside tent. It takes almost two decades for the crime to be solved, and the whole situation is metaphoric of a way of life that spurns - and has been spurned by - the modern world. Perhaps the north is more and more a home for men (rather than women), an isolating world of elk blood and gun oil. Yet Ekman has made her home there, and her evocation of the landscape recalls such literary forebears as Nor way's great visionary novelist, Tarjei Vesaas, or Finland's children's writer of genius, Tove Jansson. </p> <p>Danish Peter H\u00f8eg's bestselling Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (Harvill, \u00a37.99) also pays tribute to the north. Here power resides not in Copenhagen, which is presented as promoting bureaucratic secrecy and institutionalised racism, but in Denmark's former Arctic colony, Greenland: the heroine, farouche and percipient, is half Inuit. H\u00f8eg has gone on to champion the atavistic (and honest) over the societised (and dishonest) in later work, notably The Woman and the Ape (Harvill, \u00a36.99). </p> <p>But the majority of Scandinavians, of course, live in cities and are members of sophisticated, high-tech communities. For the greater part of the past century they have enjoyed international pre-eminence for their social democracy; in Sweden especially, the Social Democrat parties have known remarkable political hegemony. Closer integration with Europe could mean surrender of integrity, so opposition to \"Brussels\" frequently comes from the left. </p> <p>One prominent literary spokesperson for this faction is the fine Swedish novelist and dramatist P-O Enquist, while in Norway a writer of major stature imaginatively bound up with the old left is Per Petterson. For me his To Siberia (Harvill, \u00a312.99) is one of the past decade's most moving novels. It charts the life of his Danish mother who, with her beloved brother, devoted her youth to the international socialist cause. </p> <p>Ecological threat aside, the new \u00d6resund bridge is so potent a symbol because it reminds us that the outside world sooner or later asserts itself. With the end of the cold war, Swedish neutrality - a principled apartness - was no longer easy to justify; its critics saw it as shot through with evasions and deceptions.</p> <p>The shadow of the second world war grew longer as the 20th century neared its end. A distinguished Swedish journalist observed that his country had never produced a writer who'd tackled head-on the subject of Swedish war guilt, as Max Frisch did in comparable Switzerland. Norway remembered that one of its greatest writers, Knut Hamsun, was an ardent, unrepentant Nazi, and P-O Enquist wrote a fine film script about him. Suddenly a hornet's nest had been disturbed; it is buzzing still. A magnificent Norwegian novel, Gunnar Kopperud's The Time of Light (Bloomsbury, \u00a315.99), enters the mind of a young German fighting at Stalingrad and helps us all to come to terms with guilt and complicity. </p> <p>Unfortunately, not all Scandinavia's talents have been promoted or even translated for English speakers. Norway's Kjell Askildsen's fascinating short stories deserve greater currency, while his compatriot Dag Solstad's explorations of shifting Norwegian society await a translator - as does the work of Sweden's socially incisive and psychologically bold Bodil Malmsten, and of Jonas Gardell, who has broken his country's fixation with the norm with his gay sensibility expressed in novels, plays and outrageous one-man shows. Agneta Pleijel, whose George Eliot-like moral seriousness combines with acute lyrical insight, has been translated only patchily.</p> <p>Admirable Edinburgh publisher Canongate next month publishes the Danish Jens Christian Grondahl's anatomy of marriage and personality, Silence in October, but no one has offered the Swede Bj\u00f6rn Ranelid's work to the English world. And who will render into English the Norwegian poet Steinar Opstad's sensitive insights into the familial and personal? Clearly it will take more than the \u00d6resund bridge to open up communications.</p> <p>\u0095 Paul Binding edited The Babel Guide to Scandinavian Fiction (Boulevard, \u00a39.95).</p>",
  "<p><strong> The.Powerbook</strong> <br>Jeanette Winterson <br>Jonathan Cape, \u00a314.99, 243pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450139,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>\"I loved a woman who was married. She loved me too, and if there had been less love or less marriage I might have escaped. Perhaps no one really does escape.\" Jeanette Winterson's eighth novel, The.PowerBook, sets the triangular affairs of \"the great and ruinous lovers\" in the contexts of contemporary and classic fairytale, in London, Paris, Capri and cyberspace. Narrator Ali, or Alix, uses \"DNA\" to create an endless series of passionate, doomed love stories. </p> <p>Designed to suggest the appearance and the technique of virtual reality, with a cover like a computer handbook and chapter divisions of hard drives, icons and documents, The.PowerBook is not a playful postmodern experiment or an investigation of the multiple personalities of email. Instead, Winterson uses the metaphor of email to discuss sexual freedom and power. Sex, like the web, is an \"orderly anarchic space that no one can dictate, although everyone tries\". It is a story that always has a new beginning and never really ends. </p> <p>Alas - for, despite Winterson's great gifts as a writer, The.PowerBook retells the same story of adulterous bisexual love that she has been writing throughout the decade. Her obsession with the romantic triangle takes place on a higher aesthetic and intellectual level than the obsessions of this year's popular fiction, but like any of the candy-coloured novels about relationships stacked on the tables of London bookshops, it is still literary junk food. Despite a capacity for exquisite erotic prose, high intelligence and an inspiring commitment to serious art, Winterson is becoming a mannered novelist with nothing to say. </p> <p>Her plight is symptomatic of the situation of the English novel at the turn of the century: all dressed up and nowhere to go. At a historical moment of dazzling metamorphosis, when the country is transforming itself daily before our eyes - when the Thames skyline is a surreal mix of the classical, the Florentine and the avant-garde, when the English dream seems to be just over the horizon or the rainbow, as the American dream was in 1900 when L Frank Baum wrote The Wizard of Oz - English novelists are turning away from the big subjects to the perennial small change of romance.</p> <p>Writing about singles and couples, triangles and hexagons, about love instead of money, about sex instead of power, about the past instead of the future, they are measuring out in latte spoons the greatest social material offered to fiction since the 1840s. Stylish and fashionably satirical, they seem afraid to tackle big subjects and to take either the subjects or themselves seriously. </p> <p>Winterson, of course, offers a strong defence of her fictional choices in her essays and interviews. In Salon in 1997, she told interviewer Laura Miller that she was attracted to the theme of the woman having an affair with a married woman because she liked \"to look at how people work together when they are put into stressful situations, when life stops being cosy, when there is a chance element which unsettles all the rules, which forces people back onto their own resources, and away from their habits\".</p> <p>For Winterson, the romantic triangle may be a microcosm of deracination and social upheaval. Marriage, in her fiction, is a metaphor for stifling social stability and unthinking conformity. In The.PowerBook, marriage is a space with \"too many clocks and not enough time. Too much furniture and too little space\". In Written on the Body (1992), the narrator \"used to think of marriage as a plate-glass window just begging for a brick. The self-exhibition, the self-satisfaction, smarminess, tightness, tight-arsedness\". </p> <p>Moreover, Winterson sees herself, not without justification, in the high-modernist, anti-realist tradition of Woolf and Stein. \"I am not interested in realism for its own sake,\" she insists in the introduction to her screenplay Great Moments in Aviation. \"The point of fiction is not to mirror real life but to set out from it, to alter our viewing angle and perhaps even the world we are viewing.\" Similarly, she rejects plot: \"I do not like it. I think it is best left to crime writers of the old school.\" If the novel is to survive, she argues in Art Objects (1996), \"it will have to do more than to tell a story. Fiction that is print television is redundant fiction. Fiction that is a modern copy of a 19th-century novel is no better than any other kind of reproduction furniture.\" </p> <p>The contemporary city is a background for her fiction, but never the subject. \"I wrote The Passion in 1986,\" she notes, \"boomtime of the Thatcher years, clock-race of yuppies and City boys, rich-quick, never count the cost. My own cities were invented; cities of language, cities of connection, words as gangways and bridges to the cities of the interior where the coin was not money, where it was all emotion.\" </p> <p>No critic has the right to tell a novelist what or how to write, and my disappointment in The.Powerbook is not about its style or choice of subject, but about its repetitiveness and reductiveness. In Winterson's invented cities, no emotional coins are larger than 50p, although she is dealing with the higher mathematics of relationships. At the commercial end of the fiction market, too many talented young writers who could be taking on the big Balzacian questions of the day are settling for the safety of novels in which the most dramatic event is a slap in the face at a party. The flippant anti-marriage novels of the millennium, from Amy Jenkins's Honeymoon to Julie Burchill's Married Alive, lack even the social resonance of the doctrinaire New Woman novels of the fin de si\u00e8cle.</p> <p>Cities of the interior have a place on the map of fiction, but I hope that in the decade to come, British novelists will also look at the real cities changing around them and find language for the new stories of aspiration, ambition and adventure they contain.</p>",
  "<p>\u0095 If Mariella Frostrup wanted to swap her image of husky blonde sex goddess for earnest bookworm, she might have thought twice about giving an interview to Scotland on Sunday that emphasised, shall we say, her natural attributes.</p> <p>Amid tales of Tatler most-invited lists, friendships with Mick Jagger and Salman Rushdie (he's \"lots of fun\"), film premieres and little black Vespas, the article informed us that Frostrup has \"the kind of succulent tanned flesh that men want to bite into\".

But if you can't beat them, join them: \"Sidle up to the editors and get yourself introduced\", the article encourages, while at the same time being prepared to \"pester, pester, pester\" and expecting people to be \"rude and offhand to you\".</p> <p>The Loafer's tiny contribution to the debate is to make sure you get the name of the literary editor right: our very own Claire Armitstead might look less than kindly on a submission addressed to Claire Amistead, as directed by Mslexia.

  "By the end of the second world war the ultra-orthodox Jewish sect of Bobov from Galicia, in southern Poland, had been all but wiped out by the Nazi Holocaust. Virtually single-handedly Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, who has died aged 92, revived it. He became perhaps the most loved and respected leader of the Hassidic world. <p>More than 100,000 people lined New York's streets for his funeral. Many in the entourage owed him their lives. Today, Bobov claims 120,000 members internationally. Many live near the rabbi's majestic headquarters in Brooklyn's Borough Park. Others populate outposts dotted throughout the United States, Israel and Europe - including London's Stamford Hill. </p> <p>Rabbi Shlomo was renowned for his acts of charity for both Jewish and non-Jewish causes, his Talmudic learning, and his love of life - what he described as \"the child in me\". Well into his 80s he danced with the sacred scrolls during Simchat Torah (the Joy of the Law festival). On Sukkot (the Feast of Tabernacles) he would exhort violinists to perform niggunim (melodies to \"cleanse the soul\") composed by his late father and previous Bobover Rebbe, Ben Zion Halberstam. And each year he presided over a Broadway-style purimshpiel, the ribald revue held on the Festival of Queen Esther. </p> <p>The Rebbe - an honorific Hassidic title - certainly cut a regal figure. Each Sabbath he wore his black velvet and silver-brocaded kaftan and huge furshtreimel (hat), his genial face framed by long sidelocks and a full beard. What a contrast, then, with the clean-shaven young partisan that Shlomo briefly became during the war. </p> <p>In July 1941 Nazis overran Lvov in the Soviet Union, to which the Halberstam clan had fled from Galicia two years earlier. The SS clubbed to death his father, the Rebbe, his mother, Chaya, and most of his siblings. Somehow Shlomo escaped with his son, Naftali - but his wife and all his other children died in the camps. </p> <p>The experience devastated his faith. He shaved off his beard, and masqueraded as a Polish officer and even as a nun, to save Jews from the Nazis. He allegedly smuggled hundreds to freedom in false-bottomed coal trucks. </p> <p>In 1946 Shlomo arrived in New York via Italy and England. He settled in Borough Park in the 1960s. As his faith revived, so did his zeal to recreate the destroyed world of \"Torah-true\" Orthodoxy, and transplant it to the New World. He would greet Holocaust survivors as they arrived in New York harbour; and helped many a refugee attend trade school and find work. </p> <p>He eventually remarried and had six more children. He also developed housing, kindergartens, schools, synagogues and Talmud academies as his father had done in eastern Europe. In 1958 he visited Israel and founded the Kiryat Bobov quarter near Tel Aviv. In 1962 he established a Bobov foothold in Stamford Hill; and proudly oversaw the installation of his son-in-law, Dayan Ben-Zion Blum, as head of a much expanded community in 1984. </p> <p>Boundlessly energetic, Shlomo had a penchant for fund-raising. New York politicians paid regular visits to his Brooklyn tisch (court), to attract his community's \"bloc vote\", and learn the concerns of Orthodox Jews. But his vision of the American dream was no assimilationist melting pot. Yiddish is spoken in Borough Park; Bobover fathers choose their daughters' husbands-to-be; and work ceases for the Sabbath. </p> <p>Shlomo was a direct descendant of Rabbi Chaim Ben Leibush, who founded the Sanz Hassidic dynasty in the mid-19th century. Over time the dynasty split up into sects, pre-eminent of which was the Bobova. Unlike the Lubavich Hassidim of New York's Crown Heights, Bobovers do not proselytise amongst other Jews. None the less, thousands of ba'alei teshuva (returnees to faith) joined Bobov because of its ecstatic devotion, impressive architectural structures and reputation for caring. These newcomers, plus the Bobovers' astounding birth-rate (most families boast more than 10 children), turned a minuscule sect into the third largest in New York. </p> <p>In 1997 the outside world intruded. Bobov Yeshiva's president was indicted on charges of laundering more than $750,000 in Colombian drug money through the sect's accounts. Another nine Bobov associates admitted guilt in 1998; one local business magnate was fined $6.3m and incurred a prison sentence. Shlomo knew nothing of this state of affairs; yet the scandal damaged his community's reputation, and raised questions about his stewardship. </p> <p>For the most part, though, he enjoyed remarkably intimate relations with his subjects. He remembered the name of every Bobover schoolchild, it was said. Some even claimed he could exorcise dybbuks (troubled spirits). Under his conciliatory and compassionate tutelage, Bobovers experienced none of the internecine strife so prevalent in other Hassidic sects and his community co-existed amicably with other Brooklyn Hassidim. </p> <p>His son, Naftali, succeeded him as Bobover Rebbe. He is survived by two sons, five daughters and many grandchildren. <br><br> \u0095 Shlomo (Solomon) Halberstam, Rebbe of the Bobover Hassidim, born 1908; died August 2 2000</p>",
  "One of Tony Blair's closest aides has joined the senior ranks of the civil service in a move which the Tories claimed was the latest example of the increasing politicisation of the service. <p> Geoff Mulgan, former head of the Demos think tank, has been appointed to a senior position in the Cabinet Office as director of the performance and innovation unit, where he will study policy problems such as the future of the post office, rural economic prospects and electronic commerce.</p> <p> Mr Mulgan, who has been advising the prime minister on social policy since the 1997 election, will receive a grade four civil service salary of between \u00a357,000 and \u00a395,000 a year, as well as qualifying for staff bonuses under performance incentive schemes operated by the Cabinet Office.</p> <p> Although Mr Mulgan went through the official civil service appointments procedures - and it is understood that he was selected by a board of civil servants and external assessors - his move to the new post was described as \"disturbing\" by the Conservatives.</p> <p> Andrew Lansley, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \"The politics of the control of the policy-making at the centre of government is a continuing and disturbing tendency under Labour.</p> <p> \"This will create further concern that a body which should be providing impartial or even challenging advice will acquire a tendency to respond to the partisan interests of cabinet ministers.\"</p> <p> The creeping politicisation of civil service posts under the Labour government has already been the subject of parliamentary select committee investigations.</p> <p> There has been concern over the recruitment of, among others, John Williams, the former political editor of the Mirror newspaper, as the foreign secretary, Robin Cook's, chief spokesman, and of another former Mirror journalist, Sheree Dodd, as head of media relations at the social security department.</p> <p> Mr Mulgan, who has told friends that he felt it was \"time to move on\", has previously worked as a public servant in local government and for the European commission.</p> <p> His relations with the civil service are reputed to be warm.</p>",
  "A primary school head with 35 years of teaching experience walked from court yesterday, her reputation publicly restored, after a high court judge quashed her conviction for slapping a pupil. <p>Marjorie Evans, 56, who has been suspended from her job at a Monmouthshire school since the incident last September, said the past year had been an ordeal she would not wish on her worst enemy. She has always denied hitting the 10-year-old boy, who has learning difficulties and cannot be named for legal reasons. </p> <p>Amid cheers and applause from supporters at Cardiff crown court she said teaching had been her life and that she wanted to resume her career. </p> <p>Her successful appeal against the conviction and three months' suspended sentence handed down by a stipendiary magistrate earlier this summer was greeted with relief by teachers' leaders who have expressed concern about the rise in the number of allegations levelled against members of the profession. Unions now intend to issue guidelines to help teachers who have to deal with pupils with behavioural problems. </p> <p>Doug McAvoy, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, which funded Mrs Evans' appeal, hailed the decision as a landmark judgment for teachers. </p> <p>Mr McAvoy, who attended the first day of the three-day hearing in a public show of support, said teachers throughout the country would celebrate. </p> <p>\"Marjorie Evans has suffered greatly over recent months. Her suffering and the threat to her professional career send a message to every teacher in Wales and England. The case demonstrates how vulnerable teachers are. They need greater protection and that requires that their professional judgment to exclude a pupil must be upheld.\" </p> <p>Mrs Evans, of Usk, south Wales, had been found guilty of common assault at Abergavenny magistrates court in July. Stipendiary magistrate Vivian Manning-Davies found that she had momentarily lost control and slapped the boy across the face when he became abusive after being told he could not go swimming with other members of his class. </p> <p>The decision sent shock waves through the profession. Mrs Evans launched an immediate appeal, insisting that she had not slapped the boy but had restrained him when he tried to push, punch and head butt her. </p> <p>Yesterday, after two days of evidence including a videoed police interview with the boy not shown at the first hearing, Mr Justice McKinnon, sitting with two magistrates, quashed the earlier verdict saying he could not understand how it was that Mrs Evans had come to be convicted. </p> <p>He said the boy's evidence was \"deeply flawed.\" It was, he said \"entirely significant\" that the boy had talked in the video interview of a plan to get Mrs Evans out of the school. </p> <p>He rejected the account of events given by another boy who gave evidence for the prosecution and found special needs teacher, Sandra Cutler, who said she had heard Mrs Evans admit slapping the boy, to be \"an unreliable witness\". </p> <p>The judge told the court: \"In our judgment the appellant was faced with a disruptive and difficult pupil. When he went to attack her, as she described, by trying to push her, punch her and head butt her she administered the entirely appropriate and approved restraint hold, took him to the staff room and calmed him down. </p> <p>\"The appellant leaves this court with her very good character entirely intact and without any blemish whatever upon it.\" </p> <p>At a press conference, Mrs Evans spoke of her relief at being cleared but expressed concern that other innocent teachers would be put through the same ordeal. </p> <p>She said she felt hurt and upset that the education authority had not made further investigations into the incident before it got to court but expressed gratitude for the support she had received from governors, teachers and parents at the school. </p> <p>\"Teaching has been my life, it has meant everything to me,\" she told reporters. \"I just couldn't believe that the very good record I had had been damned by one 10-year-old boy who was making malicious allegations.\" </p> <p>Deidre Davies, a secondary teacher from Abergavenny who launched a fighting fund for Mrs Evans in the wake of the first court case, said teachers in the area felt \"sheer delight\" at the appeal verdict. </p> <p>But she said they remained concerned that the case had gone to court at all. \"There are a lot of issues that need addressing because this has opened up a whole can of worms about the need for more supervision in classrooms where you have got emotionally disturbed and badly behaved children.\" </p> <p>David Paddison, of Robertsons, the solicitors brought in by the NUT to act for Mrs Evans, said teachers were particularly vulnerable to fabricated allegations of assault. </p> <p>The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, said: \"This is a sensible decision.\"</p>",
  "<p>Per Larsson is an unlikely Viking warrior. There are no horned helms and battle axes but the 39-year old Swede is leading his invasion on the London Stock Exchange with the weapons of the 21st century - tough words, modern technology and cash. Like Nordic raiders before him, he has found his enemy unready. </p> <p>The City has seen nothing like it. Never before has a hostile bid been launched for a stock exchange anywhere in the world. With his \u00a3808m offer, Larsson has thrown the City's old-boy network, which for centuries has run the London exchange like a gentleman's club, into a spin. </p> <p>Larsson modestly understates the impact of his broadside against the 200-year-old London exchange. Without a hint of expression in his voice, Larsson says: \"I can understand the element of surprise. It was a very big surprise\". </p> <p>While the element of surprise helps in every battle, Larsson's attack had more unexpected features than most. First, OM Gruppen, the Stockholm-based company of which he is chief executive, had barely registered in the minds of the City's highest echelons until news of the bid broke last week. Second, it was a bid by a company set up only 15 years ago for an exchange with a reputation spanning more than two centuries and by far the largest in Europe. The London exchange claims to have 34% share of the European market compared with OM's 5%. Third, the London exchange was in the throes of putting together a merger with its German rival which, albeit unpopular, was about to announce its trump card - a dramatic reduction in the cost of trading across national boundaries. </p> <p>With one strike, Larsson has put the brakes on the Anglo-German merger, winning praise from disgruntled shareholders in London who had wanted more time to consider the plan. The vote on the merger has been postponed from September 14 and looks unlikely to take place until the end of the year. </p> <p>Larsson is now embarked on a gruelling offensive which, while not intended to cause bloodshed, will certainly involve some brutal, bruising encounters with his counterparts at the London exchange. </p> <p>Don Cruickshank, the chairman of the exchange, did not even attend the meeting at which Larsson and his advisers tried to broker a friendly deal. </p> <p>Larsson's argument for taking control of the exchange is littered with technical details about liquidity and technology. </p> <p>He insists the Anglo-German plan to form iX is deeply flawed. For a start, it involves the London exchange throwing away its name. </p> <p>\"Brand is important. We Europeans tend to undervalue the importance of the brand. The London Stock Exchange is one of the strongest brands in the financial markets. To give that up in iX, we just don't understand,\" he says. </p> <p>At the heart of his argument is the battle over liquidity in the market place, the nitty-gritty detail of where deals to buy and trade shares are done. </p> <p>\"We have a view on the future that exchanges will compete about liquidity,\" he says, rubbishing the idea that exchanges need to merge to achieve that goal. </p> <p>Such is his passion about the lack of need for mergers that he walked out of a meeting 18 months ago in Paris where the London and German exchanges were trying to broker a deal between all of the exchanges in Europe to form an alliance. </p> <p><strong> Fighting to survive</strong><br> </p> <p>\"Even before the meeting started they wanted us to sign a press release. We left the meeting,\" he says, describing OM as the \"outsider\". </p> <p>He fails to see the logic of trying to get Europe's exchanges to sit around the same table and agree on the way forward. \"Our fundamental view is that you can't take eight or 15 national monopolies to create a new monopoly,\" he says. Critics might argue, however, that the exchanges are not seeking to create another monopoly but are fighting to survive in a battle for market share. </p> <p>If iX gets off the ground it will still face competition. The most obvious source is Euronext, the alliance of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels exchanges. That might eventually join hands with iX but there are still other players bidding for a place in the emerging market for pan-European share trading - the likes of Easdaq and Tradepoint, for example. </p> <p>Describing his vision of the future, Larsson says: \"London will be very strong in the blue chip shares because of its position as the world financial centre. For large IPOs (initial public offerings of shares) London should be the natural centre. </p> <p>\"Somewhere in between, there will be small, local centres,\" he says. As smaller companies develop on domestic markets they may migrate towards the bigger market in London. Frankfurt might reasonably ask, however, quite where its hugely successful Neuer Markt fits into the Larsson analysis. It is not - and does not need to be - a feeder for another exchange. </p> <p>Larsson will spend the next three months or so developing the argument in an attempt to win backing for his bid which is constructed through cash and shares in OM, listed on the Stockholm exchange which it also runs. </p> <p>His biggest problem may prove to be that the investment banks and stockbroking firms which own the London exchange do not want to swap their shares for OM's. Just one week into his fight, Larsson has been congratulated for forcing the London exchange to delay this month's vote on its merger with the Frankfurt exchange, but failed to win any vocal support for his bid. </p> <p>Larsson will also have to counter concerns that OM's technology - while highly regarded and used at 20 exchanges around the world - is fit for the challenge of London's market. It is this technology that is at the heart of OM's campaign, not least because it is one of the London exchange's greatest weaknesses. Under the terms of its merger with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse it will adopt the German technology. Whichever of the two - Deutsche B\u00f6rse or OM - can get its technology into London will get a big boost to efforts to sell its platform elsewhere. </p> <p>Larsson says he is \"very offended\" by the view that the bid has been timed to give OM's Jiway pan-European exchange venture (in partnership with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter), scheduled for launch in November, a head start over iX. \"We do have a lot better things to do. The level of the bid shows we are very committed and serious,\" he says. Jiway's focus on the retail side of the business adds weight to Larsson's protestations. </p> <p>If nothing else, the bid, even if it fails, will serve to raise the profile of OM, of which Larsson has been chief executive for the past five years. He joined the company when it was formed by Olof Stenhammar with the backing of the Swedish Wallenberg family to develop new exchanges and new technology. </p> <p><strong> Sportsman's appetite</strong><br> </p> <p>He wrote to Stenhammar, asking for a job, on the basis of the paper he had written \"while at school in the United States\" on options, the complicated financial instruments based on a formula devised by Nobel prize winners. He was working part-time as a broker while completing his study and thought OM, which was \"embracing the technology of 1985\", looked attractive. </p> <p>The paper was written during a one-year exchange to a high school in Ohio, where he was mistakenly sent because his application form contained details of his passion for playing \"football\". </p> <p>He meant soccer but ended up becoming a kicker on the American football field, another battle ground where padded shoulders and head masks are essential weapons of engagement. Not quite the attire for a Viking warrior but perhaps displays the keen sportsman's appetite for a good, clean fight. </p> <p>Saying he feels \"very well prepared\" for the battle, he concedes that if OM loses, \"as a commercial organisation, we will look for other alternatives. This change won't happen overnight\". </p> <p> <strong>The CV</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Born</strong> February 1961, Harnosane, Sweden<br></p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Uppsala University<br></p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Broker at Foreningssparbanken.

  "The runway from which the doomed Air France Concorde took off last month had not been fully checked for debris for more than 12 hours, French accident investigators said yesterday. <p>Their preliminary report into the July 25 crash, triggered by a stray 16-inch (41cm) strip of metal on the runway that slashed one of the supersonic jet's tyres, showed that routine inspection had been delayed for a fire practice. </p> <p>\"There was a firemen's drill and the runway inspection was postponed,\" Paul-Louis Arslanian, head of France's Air Accident Investigation Bureau admitted yesterday, a day after the interim report was released. </p> <p>Mr Arslanian said airport staff routinely inspect the runways three times a day at irregular intervals, but that on July 25 only one full inspection was was carried out, at 4.30am, followed by a partial inspection of the west side of the runway soon after midday. </p> <p>The third inspection, planned for about 3pm, was delayed for a 35-minute fire drill. The ill-fated Air France Concorde took off at 4.42pm, already spouting flames from its left wing, and ploughed into a hotel in Gonesse, just outside Paris, less than two minutes later, killing all 113 crew and passengers. </p> <p>A Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport spokesman, Didier Hamon, said only two runway inspections a day were required by law. </p> <p>But a spokeswoman for the British Airports Authority (BAA) said: \"We carry out about five inspections under normal circumstances. All the inspections are the same, take around 45 minutes to complete and are done throughout the day, but not at any set time. </p> <p>\"A 12-hour delay between inspections would not happen at Heathrow,\" the spokeswoman said. </p> <p>But while the delayed inspection may have had a crucial bearing on the causes of this accident, investigators said the revelation shed little light on whether burst tyres are an inherent threat to Concorde - the concern that prompted British and French aviation authorities to withdraw the supersonic jet's airworthiness certificate last month. </p> <p>\"What is important is to know what has happened, to determine the exact scenario that linked the destruction of the tyre to the fire, and to understand what caused the disturbances to the engines,\" Mr Arslanian said. </p> <p>He cautioned against drawing any hasty conclusions. </p> <p>Since the early days of the investigation, experts have said that the metal strip, painted red on one side and yellow on another and apparently not belonging to the Concorde, probably caused the tyre to explode. The original source of the strip, however, has never been identified. Mr Arslanian said he is hopeful that the source will soon be found. </p> <p>\"I am confident that if someone finds that it fell off his plane, he will not conceal it,\" he said. </p> <p>The preliminary report largely confirmed the theory of the strip causing a puncture, saying the front right tyre of the left undercarriage \"was destroyed, very likely by passing over a piece of metal\". </p> <p>Large chunks of rubber were then hurled up into the aircraft's left wing, rupturing the fuel tanks and sparking the catastrophic fire. </p> <p>The report contained photographs of a shredded Concorde tyre with a 12-inch (30cm) tear, and of the bent metal strip. </p> <p>Mr Hamon insisted nothing exceptional had been reported on the runway on the fatal day, either by the pilots using it or by the cleaners and fire servicemen who were on it in the hours leading up to the crash. </p> <p>\"If anything wrong had existed, it would have been noticed immediately,\" he said. \"We do believe that everything was done that day as it is normal to do,\" he added. </p> <p>\"On that day, nothing abnormal, nothing exceptional was reported to the airport authority.\"</p>",
  "The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday faced another high court defeat over the treatment of a failed asylum seeker who is suing the Home Office for malicious prosecution after being cleared of taking part in detention centre riots at Campsfield House, near Oxford, in August 1997. <p>Mr Justice Elias ruled that Mr Straw had \"failed to give adequate and satisfactory reasons\" for refusing John Quaquah, from Ghana, exceptional leave to remain in the UK while he prepared his case. It is the second time the high court has told the home secretary that he has erred in law over Mr Quaquah, 35. </p> <p>The judge said it was a case where the secretary of state was himself under challenge in Mr Quaquah's civil action for damages for malicious prosecution. The decision would \"significantly affect\" Mr Quaquah's interests. He refused an application to make Mr Straw pay punitive legal costs.</p>",
  "Four men appeared in court yesterday charged with the attempted murder of Charlene Daly, 11, who was shot during the feud between rival loyalist gangs in Northern Ireland. <p>Charlene was hit in the back when her family home on the loyalist Ballysally estate in Coleraine, Co Londonderry, was raked by machine gun fire on August 28. </p> <p>The attack took place as a feud between rival paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, spread from Belfast to other parts of the province. </p> <p>The four accused are John Hazlett, 29, of Limavady, Samuel Bolton, 27, from Coleraine, Thomas Dunbar, 36, from Coleraine and Philip McKergan 23, from Coleraine. They were remanded in custody after appearing at a special sitting of Ballymena magistrates court and will appear again later this month. </p> <p>Doctors said Charlene was lucky to be alive after suffering a punctured lung and several broken ribs when she was hit by a bullet as 19 shots were fired at her home. The bullet lodged in soft tissue around her left shoulder blade and remains there but Charlene was discharged from Coleraine hospital last night. A hospital spokeswoman said doctors would continue to monitor her condition but only operate if it became necessary. </p>",
  "Tory leader William Hague was yesterday urged to adopt 200 new policy ideas ahead of the next general election as part of an \"alternative manifesto\" published by a leading Conservative think tank. <p>The document from the Bow Group, a left-leaning Conservative research group, was sent out to party members just days before the party is due to publish its draft manifesto next week. </p> <p>A total of 196 policy ideas were contained in the Ideas Book 2000, including a commitment to building world class public services with an \u00a38bn increase in spending on the national health service. </p> <p>The 41-page document contained numerous populist measures to deal with the \"little annoyances of everyday life\", such as banning wheel clamps, and a ban on gazumping on house purchases. </p> <p>There were also calls for a return to old-style navy blue British passports and for pensioners to be given free postage stamps at Christmas. </p> <p>Among the key policy ideas offered to Mr Hague was the suggestion that patients have the right to more information on the performance of individual hospitals and units. </p> <p>The policy document also calls for huge savings to be made in welfare provisions, with no entitlement to unemployment benefits for the first fortnight. </p> <p>On transport policy, the Bow Group proposes raising the speed limit on motorways to 80mph and charging utilities and other companies by each square foot of road or pavement they have dug up until the work is finished. </p> <p>The document also tackled constitutional issues, calling for the number of MPs to be reduced from 659 to about 400 and creation of an English \"grand committee\" to debate legislation affecting only England. </p> <p>A Tory party spokesman welcomed the document but said the draft manifesto was already in place.</p>",
  "One of Tony Blair's closest aides has joined the senior ranks of the civil service in a move which the Tories claimed was the latest example of the increasing politicisation of the service. <p>Geoff Mulgan, former head of the Demos think tank, has been appointed to a senior position in the Cabinet Office as director of the performance and innovation unit, where he will study policy problems such as the future of the post office, rural economic prospects and electronic commerce. </p> <p>Mr Mulgan, who has been advising the prime minister on social policy since the 1997 election, will receive a grade four civil service salary of between \u00a357,000 and \u00a395,000 a year, as well as qualifying for staff bonuses under performance incentive schemes operated by the Cabinet Office. </p> <p>Although Mr Mulgan went through the official civil service appointments procedures - and it is understood that he was selected by a board of civil servants and external assessors - his move to the new post was described as \"disturbing\" by the Conservatives. </p> <p>Andrew Lansley, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \"The politics of the control of the policy-making at the centre of government is a continuing and disturbing tendency under Labour. </p> <p>\"This will create further concern that a body which should be providing impartial or even challenging advice will acquire a tendency to respond to the partisan interests of cabinet ministers.\" </p> <p>The creeping politicisation of civil service posts under the Labour government has already been the subject of parliamentary select committee investigations. </p> <p>There has been concern over the recruitment of, among others, John Williams, the former political editor of the Mirror newspaper, as the foreign secretary, Robin Cook's, chief spokesman, and of another former Mirror journalist, Sheree Dodd, as head of media relations at the social security department. </p> <p>Mr Mulgan, who has told friends that he felt it was \"time to move on\", has previously worked as a public servant in local government and for the European commission. </p> <p>His relations with the civil service are reputed to be warm.</p>",
  "The government has no plans to implement legislation for no-fault divorce in England and Wales which was passed by parliament in 1996, the Guardian has learned. <p>The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, will resist pressure from his advisory board on family law to bring into force part two of the Family Law Act 1996 and end the use of the fault-based grounds of adultery and unreasonable behaviour, which now account for more than two in three divorces. </p> <p>The board told Lord Irvine in its annual report that it was surprised and disappointed when he announced in June 1999 that the reforms would not be brought into force this year, and that no decision would be taken until after the final results of a pilot study of compulsory \"information meetings\" for those contemplating divorce. </p> <p>Lord Irvine has received the results in a report from Professor Janet Walker of Newcastle university but he has no intention of implementing no-fault divorce legislation. </p> <p>His stance will be a blow to the advisory board, which has described the current law as widely discredited and the issue of fault as a \"central, corrosive element\" in it. </p> <p>The government is not opposed to no-fault divorce but has no great attachment to the act, pushed through by the last government in the face of substantial opposition by \"moral majority\" peers and MPs. Substantial amendments made the divorce process longer and more complicated than originally planned and the resulting compromise has been described as a \"dog's breakfast\", by a leading divorce researcher, Professor Gwynn Davis of Bristol university. </p> <p>Even the advisory board concedes that a backlash could be provoked by the length of time a divorce would take under the planned law - up to 21 months for couples with children, compared to three or four months for a \"quickie\" divorce under the current law. </p> <p>Ministers are reluctant to categorically rule out implementation because the reform was passed by parliament. Under the reforms a divorce would be granted at the request of one party without the need to prove fault, after a period for \"reflection and consideration\". But the couple would have to reach a financial settlement and resolve issues over any children before the divorce could be finalised. </p> <p>While most family lawyers favour no-fault divorce in principle, many feel the act is too complicated, drawing out an already painful process. The government could introduce a bill of its own but has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future, because it would inevitably meet the same opposition in the House of Lords. </p> <p>Nor will it go ahead with compulsory information meetings, which were part of the no-fault process laid down by the act. These have been extensively (and expensively) piloted at a cost of \u00a31m for the research alone. </p> <p>The meetings were intended to inform people about the issues they would need to tackle and the services available for resolving difficulties. But the information was delivered in a standardised form while the research found that people wanted information geared to their circumstances. </p> <p>A key aim of the act was to save public money by diverting people wanting legal aid for their divorce battles away from expensive lawyers and into cheaper mediation services. Provisions to encourage divorcing couples to use mediation are in a separate part of the act already in force. </p> <p>Ministers hoped a rule requiring those applying for legal aid for a divorce battle to undergo assessment, to see if their cases were suitable for mediation, would produce a big saving. But mediation needs co-operation by the other spouse, and research by Prof Davis, which went to the lord chancellor last month, found that few couples actually went through the process.</p>",
  "The senior Indonesian generals thought to be responsible for masterminding last year's orgy of violence in East Timor are likely to escape prosecution after their names were omitted from a provisional list of 19 suspects issued by government investigators yesterday. <p>The investigator, Muhammad Abdul Rachman, said that the fact that the list did not name General Wiranto, who was armed forces commander last year, General Faisal Tanjung, the then security minister, and Major General Zacky Anwar, the intelligence chief for East Timor, \"did not close the possibility that they could be named later\". </p> <p>However, his tone suggested that neither they nor senior militia commanders, who carried out much of the killing but were also not on the list, would ever become suspects. </p> <p>The campaign of army-backed militia violence in East Timor led to the murder of more than 1,000 people. </p> <p>The East Timorese leader Jose Ramos Horta said it was \"absolutely unacceptable\" and that the United Nations now had no option but to insist on an international war crimes tribunal along the lines of those convened for Bosnia and Rwanda. The UN has thus far refused to establish a tribunal because officials say Indonesia should first be given the opportunity to bring those responsible to justice. </p> <p>Those named yesterday included three low-ranking generals.The former civilian governor of East Timor, Abilio Soares, was also declared a provisional suspect, as were a handful of army colonels and a couple of junior militia commanders. </p> <p>The government investigation examined five specific incidents: the death of the Financial Times journalist Sander Thoenes, the massacres at churches in the towns of Liquica and Suai, and the attack on the homes of the Nobel peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo and the prominent pro-independence campaigner Manuel Carascalao. </p> <p>Mr Rachman said questioning would begin next week but could give no date for when trials might begin. Indonesia's parliament has yet to pass the legislation which will create ad hoc human rights courts - required under Indonesian law to try the suspects. </p> <p>In January a team from Indonesia's human rights commission completed an initial investigation into the atrocities for the government. They recommended that 33 people, including Mr Wiranto, Mr Tanjung, Mr Anwar and the militia leader Eurico Guterres should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. </p> <p>A separate UN panel concluded earlier that the violence \"would not have been possible without the active involvement of the Indonesian army.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Department of Social Security was last night accused of using big brother tactics after a campaign group opposed to the child support agency was forced to remove inflammatory material, including incitements to violence against CSA staff and the name and address of an agency employee, from its website. </p> <p>The National Association for Child Support Action, which campaigns for the closure of the CSA, deleted the material from its site at <a href=\"http://www.nacsa.org.uk\">www.nacsa.org.uk</a> after Anita James, the official solicitor for the DSS, wrote to the organisation's internet service provider complaining about material appearing on the website's bulletin boards. </p> <p>The offending content, posted by users of the site, included messages suggesting that opponents of the CSA throw excrement and sulphuric acid at agency employees and attack them with broken glass, as well as giving the name and address of the CSA employee. </p> <p>In her letter to Inato, the internet provider that hosts the Nacsa site, Ms James wrote: \"The website contains information which may be defamatory, amount to the civil tort of harassment under the Protection from Harass ment Act and may contain material which may amount to malicious falsehood, all of which are actionable in civil law. </p> <p>\"In addition, the material may breach the criminal law - harassment, incitement to commit criminal damage, grievous bodily harm and worse. I am therefore inviting you to close the website. If you fail to do so, I reserve the right to go to the high court to seek an injunction.\" </p> <p>The site was permitted to remain open with the offending messages removed after Inato agreed to monitor the bulletin boards to prevent similar messages being posted in the future. There was anger, however, at the DSS's decision to hold the internet provider responsible for the content of a site that it hosts. </p> <p>\"My concern is that the government appear to be chasing ISPs rather than the organisations whose sites they host in order to suppress messages they don't want to hear,\" said Adam Hunter, managing director of Inato. </p> <p>\"Ultimately it's like making the post office responsible for delivering letter bombs.\" </p> <p>\"Larger ISPs would have simply closed the site down but I felt there was a principle at stake and I don't like to see sites close, so I mediated with the Department of Social Security and reached this compromise on behalf of Nacsa.\" </p> <p>Inato, which hosts around 2,500 websites, maintains all its sites via servers in Baltimore, and therefore any injunction against the company to close websites would have to be applied for in the US. </p> <p>Nacsa, which does not itself endorse violent action against CSA employees, has said it will remove the bulletin boards on which the messages appeared next week. The agency's co-ordinator Neale Sheldon said he felt that the DSS action was motivated by government antipathy towards his organisation. </p> <p>\"Since the news of the latest CSA-related suicide and the new Child Support Act being approved by parliament at the beginning of August the amount of people visiting our website and becoming full members has been overwhelming. Five hundred thousand hits to our website in August has obviously concerned the government and we believe they are using 'big brother' tactics,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Sheldon said Nacsa was willing to delete items from the website but would not close it down. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the DSS said that as a responsible employer it had a duty to protect CSA staff and that it had acted accordingly.</p>",
  "Something is stirring amid the reverential quiet of the City of London cemetery at Manor Park, the country's largest burial ground. Hushed tones and respectful silences may be the usual mode of behaviour, but Ian Hussein, director of the city's cemeteries, can barely contain his frustration. <p>A suspicion he has been harbouring for years is rapidly becoming a crisis, but he believes few in power are listening to his warning: we are running out of space to bury the dead. </p> <p>As inner London boroughs face filling their cemeteries completely in seven years on average, meetings next week are expected to call for urgent action to address the crisis and accuse the government of having reneged on proposals to legalise the only realistic solution. </p> <p>At a public debate organised by the Museum of London, and an international conference at Goldsmith's College, academics and professionals will argue that it is time to break one of the last taboos - and begin to reuse existing graves. </p> <p>\"There is a consensus in the profession that reuse is the only way we are going to make cemeteries sustainable,\" said Mr Hussein, who is chairing the debate, organised as part of Grave Concerns, a two month exhibition on the disposal of London's dead, which opened at the museum yesterday. </p> <p>\"But I firmly believe one or more senior politicians have stamped on this initiative because they see no votes in it.\" </p> <p>Julie Rugg, of York University's cemetery research group, agreed: \"We need to know why the government is not saying anything. I think there is a fear at ministerial level that people are going to find this area quite distasteful.\" </p> <p>Graveyard overcrowding is at its worst in Hackney and Tower Hamlets, neither of which have any space remaining at all, though the problem is critical in urban areas across the country. Building new cemeteries is an unpopular option, but burial authorities are hamstrung. </p> <p><b> Bygone echoes</b><br> </p> <p> Since the 1970s they have been permitted to reclaim plots after between 50 and 100 years, and to exploit any grave spaces within them that were never used. But archaic laws - dating from an era when grave robbing was rife - mean they are banned from disturbing any bones below. </p> <p>This renders impossible their preferred solution, \"lift and deepen\", in which an old grave is reopened, the remains removed and reburied more deeply, leaving space above for the newly deceased. It is already an accepted practice in much of Europe. \"You can disturb human remains in this country for any reason you care to name - housing development, shopping complexes, road widening, you name it,\" said Mr Hussein, whose organisation has for years been buying back plots it is banned from redigging. </p> <p>\"But the one thing the government will not allow is for graves to be disturbed for the purposes of creating more graves.\" Nor, he adds, should talk of a crisis be lightly dismissed. \"Death is, after all, one subject which affects everyone in the end.\" </p> <p>This was not supposed to happen. The filling up of our burial grounds has often been assumed to be a temporary problem, as the popularity of cremation skyrocketed from its immediately post-war level of 4% to 71% today. </p> <p><b> Side-effects</b><br> </p> <p> But there are alarming signs that numbers choosing cremation are stabilising, even reversing, Dr Rugg warned - partly because some cultural and religious groups will never tolerate cremation and partly because of fears of the alleged (and disputed) environmental side-effects of the practice. </p> <p>But more universal factors are coming into play too, she says. \"Even where people are being cremated, more are choosing to bury the remains with a memorial. People are finding they want somewhere to go back to.\" </p> <p>Though notoriously queasy on such matters, British public opinion has proved surprisingly ready to accept grave reuse, if sensitively implemented. The most recent authoritative study, conducted by the University of Nottingham in 1995, found that 62% supported reuse in principle and 35% opposed it. </p> <p>If graves are left 100 years before being disturbed, there is, in any case, less to be queasy about: in most soils, skeletal remains will no longer resemble humans, and will probably have disappeared entirely. </p> <p>The conservation arguments are a different matter: a long-running dispute over the manner in which Lambeth council has bought and cleared plots at the West Norwood cemetery in south London in preparation for potential future reuse is still far from being resolved. </p> <p>Consecutive governments have acknowledged the overcrowding problem, and over the last two years the Home Office has conducted research in the field. But despite repeated hints that proposals for legal reform were to be published - in autumn 1999, and again this spring - campaigners have been met with silence. </p> <p>\"We will be publishing a consultation paper, but we don't have a date for it, and there is nothing imminent,\" said a Home Office spokesman. \"The legislation is very old - it's the 1857 Burial Act - and we don't think it allows any way to reuse graves. This will require primary legislation, and it's going to be a major exercise.\" </p> <p>Yet if the prohibition on exhuming the dead is old, the practice of reuse itself is far older: disturbed bones were commonly taken to medieval charnel houses when space for new coffins was required. But by the 19th century, attitudes had changed: malpractice and neglect had rendered many churchyards insanitary, prompting one contemporary surgeon, GA Walker, to declare the burial of the dead in proximity to the living \"a cause, direct or indirect, of inhumanity, immorality and religion.\" </p> <p>The era saw the construction of most of the country's huge city cemeteries were constructed. Their vast acreages, it was assumed, would prove ample for anything but another outbreak of the plague. It has not turned out that way. </p> <p>On a stretch of meadow in one corner of the cemetery at Carlisle, Cumbria, Ken West has been quietly pioneering another alternative to overcrowded burial grounds for five years now. As bereavement services manager for Carlisle city council, he was the first to introduce the now fashionable concept of the \"woodland burial\". </p> <p>Nicholas Albery, of the Natural Death Centre, which promotes alternatives to traditional funerals, said of Mr West: \"We have given him awards so often it's almost embarrassing. We keep trying to give them to other people but find we have to give them to him.\" </p> <p><b> Vested interests</b><br> </p> <p> There are no gaudy headstones here, no intricate and costly memorials. Each grave is marked by a sapling, and corpses are interred in degradable wicker or cardboard coffins. The number of woodland funerals conducted at Carlisle each year is still tiny - it will reach only 50 this year, Mr West predicted - but the figure is doubling annually, while the sale of grave plots to the not yet dead is growing at an even faster rate. The initiative collided with important vested interests in the death industry. Mr West offers ceremonies without the services of funeral directors, and with coffins costing around \u00a360 instead of the price tags of up to \u00a3400 charged by the large chains of undertakers. </p> <p>\"Funeral directors saw it as the thin end of the wedge,\" said Mr West. \"They often want to sell memorials and expensive caskets. Woodland burial is the exact opposite - a humble and modest way out of this world. The whole concept is set against the commercialism coming out of America.\" </p> <p>But the truth is that Ken West's woodland burials are unlikely ever to provide more than a small part of the solution to the present emergency. </p> <p>A preference for being buried where relatives can visit means demand will stay high for spaces in inner city areas, and Dr Rugg estimates that less than 1% of all burials take place outside the traditional cemetery plot. </p> <p>\"The number of 'green burials' is insignificant in comparison with the number of people buried,\" Mr Hussein says. Reusing graves, he insists, is the only option left. \"You ask people and they say, that's horrible, digging up the dead, but then you sit them down for five minutes and explain it and they say: why on earth aren't we doing this already?\"</p>",
  "George W Bush's presidential campaign turned negative yesterday, when the jittery Republican candidate for the White House launched the first personal \"attack ad\" of the 2000 contest against his Democratic rival, Al Gore. <p>Mr Bush has authorised the airing of an election commercial this weekend which mocks Mr Gore's character and credibility, accusing him of reinventing himself, using video footage of a controversial fund-raising visit to a Buddhist temple four years ago, and deriding his claim that he helped to create the internet. </p> <p>The launch of the ad, which refers viewers to a new and not yet operational website titled gorewillsayanything.com, triggered a series of sharp and not wholly credible exchanges between the two camps. </p> <p>The Bush campaign tried to play down the obviously critical ad as \"tongue-in-cheek\", while the Gore campaign let fly with righteous indignation and crocodile tears over the depths to which its opponents have suddenly sunk. </p> <p>The new Bush ad was \"a humorous way of making an important point,\" said Mr Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes. \"There is a gaping gap between what Vice-President Gore says and what Vice-President Gore does.\" </p> <p>But Mr Gore's running mate, Joe Lieberman, countered: \"I'm sorry to say that Governor Bush's promise to change the tone of American politics has run into the realities of a troubled Bush-Cheney campaign. </p> <p>\"These new attack ads break his promise not to launch personal attacks in the campaign and they drag us back to the worst politics of the past. It seems to me today that Governor Bush has sadly changed his tune about changing the tone.\" </p> <p>Privately, the Gore camp is delighted that Mr Bush has become the first of the two men to resort to negative tactics. Eager to protect its latest tactical advantage, the Gore campaign promptly put a hold on plans to launch a sharply critical commercial attacking Mr Bush's record as governor of Texas. </p> <p>In contrast to his decision a week ago to stop the airing of an attack ad against Mr Gore, Mr Bush personally authorised the release of the new election commercial on Wednesday. It was due to begin running last night in 17 states. </p> <p>It shows a television set on a kitchen counter with Mr Gore on the screen. An unseen woman's voice complains that Mr Gore is \"reinventing himself on television again\". As the commercial shows the clips of Mr Gore visiting the Buddhist temple and telling an interviewer: \"I took the initiative in creating the internet,\" the woman says: \"Yeah, and I invented the remote control.\" </p> <p>\"Surely it's fair game for us to point out his fundamental hypocrisy on his number one issue,\" Cliff May, a Republican National Committee spokesman, said. </p> <p>The Democrats were content \"to watch the Republicans shoot themselves in the foot\", according to the party spokeswoman Jenny Backus. </p> <p>The launch of the ad comes at the end of two bad weeks for Mr Bush in his struggle against Mr Gore. After months in the lead, polls indicate that, at worst, Mr Gore is back on level terms with Mr Bush following his appearance at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last month. </p> <p>Although most American political observers tend to be sceptical of any election opinion polling before this weekend's traditional Labour Day holiday, the new closeness in the presidential race has provoked disagreement within the Bush camp about how best to campaign against Mr Gore. </p> <p>The launch of the new ad has been widely seen as a sign of Bush nervousness, but one which could pay dividends. </p> <p>\"This is a political version of investing in junk bonds,\" Stu Rothenberg, a campaign analyst, said. \"A dramatic and risky move which has the potential for a significant return.\"</p>",
  "An English mother was yesterday ordered by two judges to send her two children to a French-speaking school because her estranged husband wants them to keep their cultural background. <p>The 35-year-old, who is seeking a divorce from the 42-year-old French father, wants her two children - a boy aged six and a girl of eight - to have an English education. </p> <p>But the father says that because the children live with the mother, they will lose their French cultural background if they are educated at a English-speaking school. </p> <p>Both children, who cannot be identified by order of the court, were born in England and speak \"reasonable but not fluent French\", according to the mother's evidence. </p> <p>They are now attending small private schools but both will move next week to a day school in London where lessons are held in French only. </p> <p>Bruce Blair QC, representing the mother at the court of appeal yesterday, said that the father had said his wife could not be relied upon to promote a bilingual and bicultural background for the children. </p> <p>Mr Blair said the mother spoke fluent French, had a French boyfriend, and took her holidays in France with the children, who were constantly exposed to the culture and language. </p> <p>Lord Justice Robert Walker, giving the court's judgment yesterday, said he could not alter the ruling of a high court judge, David Gee, that \"the best opportunity for the future of these children is for them to have the opportunity of going\" to the French-speaking school. </p> <p>Lord Justice Walker, sitting with Lord Justice Simon Brown, said both parents were \"well educated and prosperous\". </p> <p>They married in 1990 and set up home in south-west London, where the two children were born. </p> <p>The judge said that the father worked for a Japanese bank in London and the stresses of his job contributed to the marital breakdown. </p> <p>After a failed attempt at reconciliation which would have involved the family moving to France, the mother filed for divorce a second time in January. </p> <p>The mother, who will be applying for maintenance when the divorce is completed, intends to stay in London but the father, who was made redundant last year, may return to France, said the judge. </p> <p>The girl's headmistress, in a plea to the court not to send the eight-year-old to the 2,500-pupil French-speaking school, said she was happy in her small class and put up a confident front \"to hide the unsettled life she is leading at the moment\". </p> <p>Lord Justice Walker said the father maintained that his children had a bilingual and bicultural background and he wanted that to continue although they would be brought up in England. </p> <p>The judge said that the mother wanted her children to have an English education and objected to the French-speaking school because of its size, the fact its lessons were taught in French, which would make it difficult for her to help them with their homework, and the disruption the move would cause to them. </p> <p>Lord Justice Walker said Judge Gee had found that the French school would be the best solution to achieve a balance of Englishness and Frenchness for the children. </p> <p>Lord Justice Walker said Judge Gee had a \"difficult decision\" to make and decisions often involved uncertainty but there was no reason to change his ruling. </p> <p>He dismissed the mother's appeal and ordered her to pay the costs of the hearing. </p> <p>The father, who was in court, declined to comment. </p> <p>The mother is in France on holiday with her children. <br><br>Press Association</p>",
  "It is statistically safer to ride on a rollercoaster than to boil an egg. But that will be no comfort to the 14 people who were injured on the Big One ride at Blackpool Pleasure Beach on Thursday night. <p>Two teenage boys from the seaside town suffered broken legs and were detained in hospital overnight after being injured on the 235ft high ride. The other passengers suffered bruising and whiplash injuries. </p> <p>The rollercoaster, hailed as the world's tallest and fastest when it opened six years ago, is one of Britain's 130 rollercoasters in a market competing to offer passengers the most thrilling experience. </p> <p>Other rides dotted around the country include the first vertical drop rollercoaster, a stand up ride, one with five inversion turns, and the only triple looper. It is a multi-million pound business and enthusiasts have fan clubs and websites where they compare and review the various rides. </p> <p>The health and safety executive is investigating the Blackpool incident, which happened when two slow-moving cars crashed into each other. </p> <p>The HSE said there were 284 accidents involving fairground rides last year but none was fatal. In the previous year, there were 333 accidents and no deaths. But so far this year there have been five deaths. </p> <p>David Cam, director and company secretary of Blackpool Pleasure Beach, said the accident happened as one car was coming into the station and the other was just outside the station. </p> <p>The company called in the HSE and started its own investigation to find out exactly what happened. </p> <p>The cars were travelling at approximately two or three miles an hour when the accident occurred. </p> <p>Last month, Christopher Sherratt, 11, of Blackpool, died at Blackpool Pleasure Beach after he fell off the Space Invaders ride. </p> <p>In July 1994, a week after the Big One opened, 26 people were injured when a train travelling at 35mph failed to stop because of a computer failure. It eventually stopped when it crashed into another train. Eight passengers were cut free from the wreckage. </p> <p>The ride, which carries 2m passengers a year, has now been closed until an investigation is carried out, but the other rides remain open. </p> <p>A spokesman for the HSE said: \"We have found that the accident and injury rate for fairground rides fluctuates from year to year. This year there have been five fatalities, but three years ago there were none. </p> <p>\"Children are statistically 20 times more likely to be injured on a horse than on a ride.\" </p> <p>Richard Pawley, of the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions, who is also operations director of Drayton Manor Park, said there were 76m riders on rollercoasters within the UK every year. </p> <p>All the rollercoasters were subjected to daily safety checks and there was strict legislation governing their safety. </p> <p>\"There are 130 rollercoasters in the UK and they are working 100% safely,\" he said. \"I was speaking to the health and safety executive about it, and statistically it is safer to go on one of these rides than to boil an egg in your own kitchen.\" </p> <p> <b>Ins and outs of Britain's top rides</b><br><br><b> The Big One</b> at Blackpool Pleasure Beach is marketed as the world's fastest and tallest rollercoaster.

  "The seizure of British troops by a rag-tag band of teenage soldiers in Sierra Leone is the aperitif. Lunch follows next Thursday when heads of state from the 15 members of the United Nations security council hold a special meeting in New York on international peacekeeping in Africa. Unless a serious rethink is given to the whole UN operation in Sierra Leone before the prime minister and his colleagues sit down to the table, the meeting will be hollow and the menu nothing but fudge. <p>The framework for strong action is clear enough. Ten months ago the UN sent a peace force to Sierra Leone to support the government in its war with the so-called Revolutionary United Front. Sierra Leone was a stereotypical case of a weak state with an ineffective government trying to pick up the pieces left by an earlier corrupt ruler. There was an argument for the outside world to do nothing, but after the interventions in Kosovo and East Timor, and the UN's failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda, those who advocated a UN role in Sierra Leone were right. Africa could not just be abandoned. The initial UN operation did not work well and in May some 500 of its troops were seized by the RUF. It was at that point that Britain acceded to an urgent request by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, for help. Britain intervened with around a thousand troops, though strictly on a unilateral mandate and without putting them under UN control. The intervention worked, at least temporarily, and when Britain withdrew most of its troops, they were replaced by a larger UN presence, mainly consisting of Nigerian, Jordanian, and Indian troops. Mr Annan now wants to increase the force from its present 13,000 men to just over 20,000. </p> <p>The crisis over the British troops seized by the gang known as the West Side Boys has shown that the solution to Sierra Leone's problems is not purely one of quantity. The existing UN force is lax and inefficient and has allowed undisciplined village volunteers to become licensed bandits, setting up roadblocks and terrorising civilians virtually unchecked. The Sierra Leone army which was to be trained by the British remains unimpressive. Adding more UN troops will not necessarily change the situation unless the whole style and nature of the UN operation is made more professional. This is where Britain has a role to play. If negotiations with the West Side Boys fail, there may well be a temptation for Britain to send in the military equivalent of a snatch squad, a helicopter-borne SAS team, to try to rescue the six errant British servicemen. The government seems to fear that tabloid pressure to \"save our boys\" could mount if the hostage drama goes on. But the fate of the six soldiers is not the main issue. Whether a military swoop rescues the hostages or not, the bigger question is how to rescue the UN operation in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>One way for that to be done is for Britain to reverse the decision it took last May to confine its intervention to training. It ought to go back into Sierra Leone in a major way with a substantial presence that is under a new combined UN command. No other permanent member of the security council is likely to want to get involved. The United States is in embroiled in elections. France has no stomach for involvement in former British colonies. Russia and China have no interest in sending troops. Britain took the initial decision to intervene in May, knowing that it could lead to a wider involvement. For better or worse that moment has come.</p>",
  "Friends and supporters of Simon Jones, a casual worker who was killed while unloading a ship at Shoreham docks, yesterday gathered outside the crown prosecution service office in London in protest at its failure to prosecute his employer for manslaughter. <p>Last March, two high court judges overturned a decision by David Calvert-Smith, director of public prosecutions, and the CPS not to prosecute - they had, the judges ruled, behaved \"irrationally\" by insisting there was no realistic prospect of conviction - and ordered them to reconsider \"with dispatch\". </p> <p>But five months later the DPP has still not come to a conclusion, despite a police recommendation to prosecute for manslaughter. A CPS spokeswoman said yesterday that the case was still under consideration by Mr Calvert-Smith, adding: \"We've had a lot to consider\". </p> <p>About 70 people gathered in the City of London for the protest. </p> <p>A police spokeswoman said that there was one arrest after a police officer was assaulted. </p> <p>Yesterday George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Kelvin, who has led the campaign in parliament on the case and has called for a public inquiry into the CPS's handling of workplace deaths, said the DPP's continuing failure to prosecute was inexplicable. </p> <p>Mr Jones's mother, Anne Jones, said she found it incredible. </p> <p>Mr Jones, 24, was killed and his head partly severed by a crane grab while he was unloading cobblestones from a Polish ship for a Dutch-owned firm, Euromin, within two hours of starting work on April 24, 1998. </p> <p>Euromin and its general manager, James Martell, were found by inspectors to have been breaking health and safety regulations. But despite pressure for action, the CPS twice refused to prosecute either Mr Martell or Euromin for manslaughter on grounds of insufficient evidence. </p> <p>The case has become a focus for those campaigning against casualisation and for tougher legal action against negligent and reckless employers. Yesterday, protesters celebrated Mr Jones's birthday - he would have been 27 - in the streets of the City of London. </p> <p>The government is consulting on a new offence of corporate killing, which would make it easier to prosecute and heavily fine firms for gross negligence. </p> <p>Under current legislation, it is necessary to prove the culpability of a manager for a charge of corporate manslaughter to stick. </p> <p>But campaigners believe that the CPS and DPP are reluctant to prosecute firms for corporate manslaughter, even where there is a realistic chance of a conviction, because they are unhappy about the consequences of company directors being sent to prison over deaths at work. </p> <p>Mrs Jones said yesterday: \"I find it absolutely incredible that after a judgment such as that given in March and after they have already had two years to consider the evidence, they need a further five months.\" </p> <p>Mr Galloway said: \"It is inexplicable that Mr Calvert-Smith would make the high court justices who demanded expedition look so foolish, and so one is left to speculate that the real reason is the possibility that a successful prosecution will see more employers guilty of gross workplace negligence in the dock on charges of manslaughter.\"</p>",
  "Informal Downing Street talks were held in a failed attempt to end the damaging dispute which has left Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF union, facing censure motions from half of his union's activists for wasting \u00a3700,000 of members' money on settling tribunal cases brought by dismissed staff. <p>The talks, between the GMB general secretary, John Edmonds, and Mr Lyons, took place after both leaders had met Tony Blair on June 26 - a week before a case brought by the GMB on behalf of a sacked MSF secretary, Marcia Solomon, came to a tribunal. </p> <p>The case led to the airing of alleged fraud and expense fiddles amounting to \u00a3130,000 against Mr Lyons and Nelson Mendes, the MSF finance chief. It cost \u00a3140,000 to settle; led to another \u00a3200,000 payout two weeks later and revelations that a former assistant general secretary, John Chowcat, was paid \u00a3250,000, preventing another damaging case. </p> <p>Details of the No 10 talks emerged after the Guardian was leaked a letter written last week by Mr Edmonds to Mr Lyons. Mr Edmonds was furious after being accused in a letter by Mr Lyons of backing Ms Solomon's allegations. </p> <p>In the leaked letter, Mr Edmonds says: \"Your letter accuses me of supporting completely unwarranted allegations of fraud and theft. I have done no such thing. I will be grateful if you will withdraw your unwarranted allegations.\" </p> <p>Mr Edmonds's letter reveals he twice warned Mr Lyons that new \"whistleblower\" legislation which the MSF asked the Labour government to introduce would cause them to lose the case. \"On at least two occasions I urged you to authorise your lawyers to offer a settlement. I am sorry you chose not to act on my suggestions.\" </p> <p>The leak comes on the eve of the MSF national executive meeting. Mr Lyons has apologised for his judgment over the Solomon case but is tomorrow facing demands from eight of the union's 14 regional councils to resign his \u00a381,000-a-year post and hold an inquiry. </p> <p>Earlier this year the Guardian revealed details of Mr Lyons's expenses which included using his union credit card to buy two radios, a luggage trolley and a 25p bun. </p> <p>An MSF spokesman yesterday blamed advice from the union's lawyers for letting the Solomon case go ahead.</p>",
  "It was one of those weeks. An avalanche of deadlines. A three-year-old vociferously expressing his dislike of a workload which meant I was not able to collect him from nursery. A husband who was working too hard and rarely present. How did I feel at the end of each day - pleased that I had managed to get through intact? No: there was hardly a moment of the day when an inner voice wasn't highlighting my failings. <p>The work wasn't good enough because I couldn't give it the time it needed. My child was being permanently damaged by my neglect. I didn't have the energy to listen to my husband's concerns. My day was being polluted by \"toxic worry\" - an insidious syndrome which manages to take away enjoyment from life. It prevented me seeing that clients were not complaining, the carer provided different sorts of fun and a work-weary partner doesn't necessarily want to talk about work. </p> <p>My failure, and that of many other women trying to work a first shift at work and a second shift at home, is that we have yet to learn how to live with the third shift. The third shift is that psychological space available for thoughts about the lives we are creating. For Michele Kremer Bolton, learning to manage the third shift so that women can live in greater comfort with their choices is the challenge of the next phase of feminism. </p> <p>Ms Bolton observed that her female business students rejected options open to them not because of lack of skill but because of an inner glass ceiling built on self-doubt which placed limits on the risks and possibilities they could see for themselves. Disappointed by the power of the inner ceiling on a highly privileged group, she carried out research with women across a diversity of employment areas, socio-economic groups, age ranges and racial identities and discovered three challenges which impacted on them all. </p> <p>The identity challenge: being able to express themselves as they really were versus trying to be what others will accept. The task challenge: getting the job done versus worrying about how everyone feels. The balance challenge: spending time on themselves versus giving time to others. </p> <p>Common to all was the focus on relationships. If a women reveals herself as she really is, she may lose the approval which comes with going along with others' expectations. If a woman focuses on the task in hand she may be seen as unconcerned for others. </p> <p>The same dilemmas exist for men, but the distinction Ms Bolton makes is that, within corporate life, successful men have often attained a subconscious \"disconnect\" which allows the dilemmas to exist without creating personal strain, or have developed means of managing that third shift which few women have accessed. </p> <p>Managing the third shift, so that concerns can be put in their place of relative importance, requires the ability to create space for the voice of self-awareness alongside the voice of self-punishment. Creating a mental box which recognises those things which are within and outside our control in relation to both people and tasks immediately puts into awareness ideas which are denied. </p> <p>If I had created that box during my week of despair, I would have recognised how I did have control over my work, the impossibility of my controlling my husband's workload, and my son's ability to control my guilt. </p> <p>I might even have patted myself on the back for getting through it all and made time to go to the gym. </p> <p>\u0095 Carole Pemberton is managing consultant at Career Matters.

  "This week the Home Office launched its first-ever nationwide recruitment campaign for the police force. The aim is to attract 9,000 extra recruits in England and Wales over the next three years to stem an alarming downward trend. <p>Last March there were 124,418 officers in the 43 police forces, more than 2,400 fewer than in 1997. According to a Home Office spokesman the campaign aims \"to raise the status of the police in the eyes of the public, and within the force itself\". </p> <p>It's a tall order, but nowhere more so than in terms of attracting recruits from black and Asian backgrounds. Responding to the recommendations of the Macpherson report, in August 1999 the Home Office set 10-year recruitment targets for individual forces pegged to the ethnic identity of the population. </p> <p>By 2010 the force aims to recruit 7% black and Asian officers, an average of 826 officers annually. </p> <p>But progress has been slow: the latest Home Office figures show that, in the past year, numbers of ethnic minority officers have risen to 2,756, just 209 more than in 1999. </p> <p>Although the number of recruits has increased by 8% since 1999; ethnic minority officers still comprise just 2% of the total force. </p> <p>On one level, forces are trying hard. Greater Manchester Police, for example, listens to the recommendations of a policy advisory group which includes representatives from the black and Asian community \"who can act as champions for us\". </p> <p>They now produce preparation packs to help officers negotiate the Initial Recruitment Test which, for reasons they say they can't identify, is failed by a disproportionate number of minority ethnic officers. </p> <p>Similar initiatives at the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) include sending volunteers into schools and careers fairs to challenge stereotypes of a straight, white male culture. The MPA has also started to place advertisements in journals such as Asian Eye and The Voice. </p> <p>But recruiting more officers will be a waste of time until the culture within the force undergoes a sea-change. In the week that this story was researched two newspaper stories - the race discrimination suffered by Gurpal Virdi and the death in custody of a black soldier - made headline news. </p> <p>No surprise then, that Denise Blake, manager of Interface, a Manchester-based mentoring programme for black and Asian students, comments: \"Sadly there is a very, very negative perception of the police. Students say 'Theyr'e doing XYZ to recruit me but they just want to hit their quotas.' They can endorse initiatives until they're blue in the face but if that action on the ground goes wrong, it undoes all the good work.\" </p> <p>Inspector Paul Wilson, chairman of the National Black Police Association, says: \"What the police have to do is demonstrate to minority communities that they can expect to be treated fairly and equitably.\" </p> <p>He believes that the main problem is less recruitment than retention. Inspector John Whitaker works at the MPA Positive Action team, which has been specifically set up to address issues of diversity. He admitted that there is currently \"a disproportionately high wastage of ethnic minority officers, many of whom complain of feeling isolated\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, David Michael, a black detective inspector and chairman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, says: \"You have to prove yourself again and again. You won't get away with the mistakes white officers make. You're tested on your ability to be a clone of your white colleagues.\" </p> <p>And how do you do that? \"You adopt the culture, you demonise black people, laugh at racist jokes,\" he comments. </p> <p>This prevailing culture has had measurable results. Of ethnic minority officers, 95% hold the rank of detective sergeant or lower and 85% are constables. Just 1% of the ranks of inspector and above come from minority communities. </p> <p>Is the dominance of white officers in senior positions, because \"we've only been successfully recruiting ethnic minorities for a short space of time,\" - as Jim Greensmith, press officer of the South Yorkshire police, claims? </p> <p>Det Insp Michael doesn't think so: \"The first black officer joined in 1967. Isn't 20 years long enough for a promotion? The simple fact is the majority of black and Asian people who apply are turned down for promotion.\" </p> <p>He wants to see the Metropolitan Police Authority conduct critical analyses of how many black officers are turned down, not just for promotion, but for their assessment. When I suggested this to Inspector Whitaker he replied: \"At the moment we spot-check those who fail at promotion to ensure there's no bias. But the more we do, the more people want us to do.\" </p> <p>It can be just as difficult to move laterally: \"When did you last see a black officer in the Flying Squad? Or on royalty protection?\" says an exasperated Paul Wilson. </p> <p>\"Black people have not been encouraged to apply for specialist posts. And cronyism has been a major factor in appointments,\" comments Det Insp Michael. He agrees that minority ethnic officers have been under-represented in certain areas, although he doesn't believe that officers have been turned down or discouraged from applying due to racist motives. </p> <p>\"There's a difference between reality and perception here. There may be a perception among ethnic minority officers that the jobs aren't for them.\" </p> <p>He does, however, admit that black officers may lack the extensive \"informal networks\" enjoyed by their white colleagues. In response, the MPA has produced separate booklets for each special operations section which include guidelines to the job and a contact for advice. </p> <p>\"We've tried to mirror those informal networks,\" explains Inspector Whitaker. </p> <p>According to a Home Office statement, the issues of promotions and specialisms were raised in 1999 at the Dismantling Barriers conference which \"looked at why fewer ethnic minority officers are put forward for promotion... and why more ethnic minority officers fail and why fewer ethnic minority officers apply and are selected for specialist departments...\" </p> <p>Among other recommendations, the conference suggested the monitoring of exit interviews. This information will be available next December. </p> <p>Forces such as the MPA and Greater Manchester now run \"active career development schemes\" for black and Asian officers with a strong mentoring component. But how long will they take to make a difference?\" </p> <p>Insp Whitaker says: \"The Home Office directive calls for proportionality for ethnic minorities and women in specialist sections by September 2001. But it's unrealistic. We won't be able to train enough officers by then.\" </p> <p>But the problem won't wait. As Insp Wilson puts it: \"A handful of exceptional role models doesn't help to encourage recruits. Black and Asian senior officers must be the norm.\" </p> <p>Is it, in fact, officers like Insp Whitaker who suffer from the gap between reality and perception? One hour before he informed me proudly of a new recruitment task force at the Met, BPA chairman Det InspMichael had said crossly: \"There's a new Met recruitment taskforce which nobody informed me about officially. I heard on the grapevine. That's how little the problem is understood.\" </p> <p>Yet Det Insp Michael's own daughter has expressed an interest in joining the force and he has no plans to dissuade her. \"It's a good career,\" he believes, \"but you've got to be honest about the issues.\" </p> <p>Those spearheading the new recruitment drive would do well to listen. </p> <p><b>Off the case: Gurpal Virdi</b></p> <p>Gurpal Virdi, 41, won his racial discrimination claim against the Metropolitan Police at a tribunal last week.</p> <p>\"In April 1998 I was arrested and suspended, allegedly for sending race-hate mail to all the ethnic minority staff at Ealing police station. When I heard I went numb; I'd received the mail myself. </p> <p>\"Their only evidence was that the mail could have come from my computer and a duty officer who changed his story to damage my alibi - although signed documents contradicted him. Even after the Crown Prosecution Service threw the case out, the force refused to back down. </p> <p>\"The tribunal rejected all their allegations; now I'm suing for unfair dismissal. I don't know why it happened to me. I was a conscientious, experienced officer; but I was always active on ethnic issues and I dealt with racism by the book, which didn't always make me popular, especially after I was promoted to sergeant. </p> <p>\"I believe that the police service was looking for ways to deflect attention from the Stephen Lawrence inquiry and my case fitted the bill. </p> <p>\"What's sad is I always wanted to join the police because my father was a police officer in India and my grandfather was in the army. I was 23 when I started and I did quite well for an Asian by getting to the rank of sergeant. </p> <p>\"Of course, you have to work twice as hard; there's bullying. You get jobs no one else wants. You don't get sent on specialist courses. </p> <p>\"I even failed to get on a driving course! </p> <p>\"I'm not surprised the police are not meeting the recruitment targets. Young people need plenty of role models - not to hear about cases like mine. </p> <p>\"At the moment I'm working for a local charity, Cranford Good Neighbours; I've always believed in doing my best for the local community; that's why I became a policeman.\"</p> <p><b>On the case: Karen Coe</b></p> <p>Karen Coe, 31, joined the South Yorkshire police force last February and is completing her probationary training </p> <p>\"My first priority was always to have children. But once my two, now 11 and eight, were more independent, I wanted a job as well. I wanted something community-based and I considered social work, but chose the police because there was a shorter training period.\" </p> <p>\"My mother was English and my father's Jamaican. I'm the only black person in my training group of 17 and one of only six women. Of course, I'm aware of the race issue but I don't dwell on it; my husband is probably more concerned than I am. </p> <p>\"It certainly hasn't been a problem yet - I haven't been treated any differently, but I'm sure that the training can only prepare me so much. </p> <p>\"I believe my generation is more broadminded than previous ones, and in future, racism should become less of a problem. But, obviously, you have to raise the issue. I think most equal opportunities and race relations training is common sense. </p> <p>\"Having said that, it's got to be spelt out so that people are made aware that it's equal opportunities for everyone now. </p> <p>\"As I grew up I thought of the force as broadly white and the shortage of black officers was one of the reasons that I joined. Nothing's going to change until there are more of us in the force.\"</p>",
  "Business guru Charles Handy says: \"It is strange that the one area of human life that is so important to our well-being, that of business, still treats its people as instruments.\" Company leaders might retort that this is necessary and dismiss as idealism Handy's vision of \"a more decent capitalism\" where businesses re-design themselves as \"communities\" not \"money machines\". <p>The better businesses, he believes, are heading this way. But most are a long way off putting community thinking before money-making and shareholder value. One company that comes close to this ideal and is showing that it pays, is management consultancy First Place Professional Development. </p> <p>The consultancy, founded in 1996 by Ray and Charlotte Martin, turns away work rather than compromise on fundamental human principles. Recently they declined work for two large companies with potential fees of \u00a3200,000. Charlotte Martin, client services director, realises this appears insane, but says they could not proceed with integrity because the companies wanted something that would not make a valuable difference. </p> <p>The Martins' passion for these principles stems from earlier experience going back to the early 80s. They wanted to redress the failure of personal developers to add value in a commercial context. They devised a cost-effective strategy which blends management development with traditional operational consultancy, tying people development to business goals. They underpinned this with eight \"Heart and Soul\" management principles that form the basis of their relationships with clients. These incorporate \"democratic\" competencies such as respect, trust, openness, honesty, fairness, consistency, and listening. </p> <p>Last autumn their approach was rigorously tested at Ventura, a large customer services call-centre business in Leeds. The company had developed cost-driven command-and-control management practices which Bruce Macleod, managing director, wished to avoid. Their service levels for a major client were falling badly behind and they wanted help to reduce staff turnover and improve service quality, while not lowering productivity. </p> <p>Charlotte Martin says their aim was to promote dialogue, partnership relationships, and autonomy as a basis for more permanent change. Kate Marsden, Ventura's HR director, noted that although their original brief was for customer service adviser training, First Place quickly identified broader cultural barriers to success. They knew change required full management support, and were keen to interact with all levels in the company. </p> <p>Front-line team leaders responded to being listened to, motivated, helped to conduct discussion sessions and jointly solve problems. The pilot programme significantly impacted on productivity and profitability and will be rolled out across the whole organisation this year. </p> <p>Ray Martin, managing director at First Place, puts their success down to their own \"human\" culture. When First Place enters a company they cannot help managers empower people unless the training process mirrors this collaborative style. </p> <p>Karl Birro, former head of telesales, Abbey National Direct, echoed many company responses when he described First Place's \"very responsive and positive\" feedback as a clear indication they wanted to get it right for them. Their reputation for doing the best for clients has meant nearly 90% of their business is generated by word-of-mouth recommendation. </p> <p>The impact of their work is being felt in the new economy. Recently, for example, they helped Self Trade, an online stockbroker, to establish their customer service operation in the UK. Four weeks after launch, Expert-rating.com voted them number three online broker in the UK and number one for customer service. </p> <p>Commercial director Alan Aldridge describes this as \"incredible\". He has heard many compliments paid by his staff to First Place who, he says, took a genuine interest in them and were extremely effective at polishing the quality of the call centre's service. </p> <p>Forty per cent of First Place work is done on a sub-contract basis. The directors know these associates well and maintain good relationships with them. Nobody is told what to do, but asked what work would excite them, and that is sought. </p> <p>A measure of the effectiveness of First Place's philosophy is its own business success. The Martins firmly believe that aiming to operate in principled ways is more potent in delivering success and wealth. This goes against conventional wisdom which sees a trade-off between treating people properly and investing in them, and profit. </p> <p>\u0095 Dr Sue Jones is a writer on management and training .</p>",
  "The United States has denounced Burma's treatment of its opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, as the country's military junta steps up its campaign against her. <p>Ms Suu Kyi has been camped in a suburb of the Burmese capital, Rangoon, since August 24, when she was blocked from driving further in defiance of a ban on her leaving the city. </p> <p>The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, said she was appalled that Ms Suu Kyi had been denied the freedom to travel within her own country. </p> <p>\"Her work gives voice to the long-suffering people of Burma whose hopes for a democratic society have been crushed by a repressive regime,\" said Mrs Albright. \"Her voice will not be silenced.\" </p> <p>But in Burma the only voice being heard is that of the junta, which is combining ridicule with threats against Ms Suu Kyi. </p> <p>She had now become an \"enemy of the people\", the junta's official website said yesterday. It argued that she is \"constitutionally disqualified to stand for elected office\" because \"[her] bloodline remains only in Britain.\" </p> <p>Ms Suu Kyi's late husband was British and they have two sons, but she has taken care to maintain her Burmese citizenship. </p> <p>Earlier, Rangoon published photographs with satirical captions suggesting that the encampment of Ms Suu Kyi's small group in the suburb of Dala was just a pleasant outing. One picture shows her car next to a hut and a tent, with the caption: \"Daw [Ms] Suu Kyi and her travel companions continuing their stay in the new rest camp at Dala.\" </p> <p>Other pictures show members of her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), \"going for an afternoon dip\" in a nearby river and \"visiting a Chinese noodle shop\". </p> <p>Ms Albright's criticism of the junta was backed on Thursday by the US vice president, Al Gore, who said that \"each day the Burmese authorities restrain [her], Burma's isolation from the international community deepens\". </p> <p>Yesterday the UN high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, expressed her concern for the safety of Ms Suu Kyi and urged Burma to resolve the standoff \"in line with international human rights standards\". </p> <p>\"I urge the two sides to engage, as soon as possible, in a substantive political dialogue\" she added. </p> <p>The standoff comes at a very bad time for the junta, said Dr Peter Carey, a family friend and south-east Asia historian at Oxford University. </p> <p>\"It is split between different factions, and the economy is at a low ebb,\" he said yesterday. \"China is still an ally but there are limits to the open cheque.\" </p> <p>But the NLD is also in a weak position. The party is struggling to survive outside Rangoon and Ms Suu Kyi's attempt to link up with party members beyond the capital is important, said Dr Carey, \"to add substance to her claim that it is still functioning\". </p> <p>The junta's propaganda offensive this week has portrayed Ms Suu Kyi and the NLD as uninterested in dialogue and preferring to indulge in \"symbolic gestures\". </p> <p>It hints that the country's universities, which have only recently reopened after being shut down in 1996, may be closed again if there are more political protests. Ms Suu Kyi was attempting a journey to meet members of the NLD's youth league when her path was blocked at Dala. </p> <p>U Maung Maung, a tea-shop owner from central Rangoon, is quoted saying that his customers \"are concerned about their children's education and some have even suggested [a law] to prevent students from participating in party politics\". </p> <p>The last time that Ms Suu Kyi tried to leave Rangoon, in August 1998, she camped with her car for 13 days before returning home on medical advice. </p> <p>Western news reports on dissent within the NLD are cited by the junta as evidence that Ms Suu Kyi \"may not be all that safe even within her own political party\". Yesterday's feature on the junta's website quoted a foreign report that party members had been sacked by her \"as traitors or as agents of [Burmese] military intelligence\". </p> <p>It is widely assumed by NLD sympathisers that the party, whose members are subject to harassment and imprisonment, has been penetrated by Rangoon's secret service. </p> <p>In a statement on Thursday Rangoon accused Ms Suu Kyi of staging her demonstration ahead of the UN millennium summit in New York next week. </p> <p>It claimed she was disrupting a \"transition towards democracy\". </p> <p>The NLD won a huge general election victory in 1990 but the junta has never allowed it to take power.</p>",
  "Japanese authorities ordered the evacuation of all remaining residents from Miyake-jima island yesterday after experts warned of the possibility of massive volcanic eruptions. <p>Most of Miyake-jima's 3,800 residents have already left the island, 125 miles south of Tokyo. Over the next three days the remaining 900 will be ferried to the mainland, where they will be given food and accommodation. </p> <p>The evacuation order came after experts from the meteorological agency said Mount Oyama, at the centre of the island, was in danger of unleashing huge pyroclastic flows - very fast-flowing frothy lava. </p> <p>Residents on the island have suffered a summer of disruption, with a series of powerful earthquakes and minor eruptions followed on August 18 by Mount Oyama's biggest eruption since 1983. </p> <p>Last week, more than 130 children and their teachers were evacuated after another large eruption. </p> <p>Although they are unable to predict the timing of an eruption, the experts were concerned by evidence that rising magma was coming into contact with underground water, a process that has potentially catastrophic consequences. </p> <p>Shintaro Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo, said the island faced \" a danger greater than anything we have experienced so far\". </p> <p>About 600 officials and emergency workers will remain on the island during the daytime to monitor volcanic activity and check gas and water supplies.

  "One snag with the plan to have six school terms a year is what could be done about Easter, which may crop up at any time between March 22 and April 25. The commission which reported yesterday suggests that Easter should be ignored. Terms would run between the same dates every year; sometimes Easter would fall in term and sometimes in the holidays. Some church opinion dislikes that, believing that it would detract from the solemn importance of Easter; though given Good Friday shopping and falling church attendances generally, the observance of Easter is not what it was. <p>At present the date is fixed by a formula of such awesome complexity that, fortunately, it cannot be summarised here. But it has to do first with the vernal equinox (the word Easter derives from a pagan celebration then) and the Jewish feast of the Passover. It is also linked with the moon, though the moon in question is not the one in the sky but a \"hypothetical moon\" related to it. Unsurprisingly, the \"correct\" date has been regularly disputed ever since the council of Nicaea in 325, when a group called the quartodecimans lost out to the quintodecimans and were declared heretics. </p> <p>That Easter should be fixed rather than floating was proposed, and defeated, as far back as 1582, when the Gregorian calendar was adopted. You might think a modernising parliament would by now be tempted to legislate. In fact it would not need to do so. In 1928, parliament passed the Easter Act, setting the date of Easter as the Sunday after the second Saturday in April. This has never come into effect. An order in council was needed to activate it and the law required that regard should be had to opinions expressed by any church or other Christian body. Most were hostile. But the act is still on the statute book. Note too that parliament is required only to \"have regard\", not to take instructions. Perhaps the time may be coming to wake the Easter Act from its 72-year sleep.</p>",
  "<p>Wickes, the do-it-yourself chain, yesterday accepted a \u00a3289m cash offer from rival Focus Do It All - only three months after seeing off a hostile takeover bid from the same company. </p> <p>Bill Grimsey, chief executive of Wickes, said the Focus offer represented a good price for the business. Focus already owns a 40% stake in Wickes, built up during its earlier bid battle. </p> <p>Mr Grimsey said that the DIY industry was undergoing a restructuring, with companies such as Homebase and Great Mills being put up for sale or seeking new partners. But Wickes' attempt to take part in the restructuring had been frustrated by the large stake held by Focus. </p> <p>Mr Grimsey led a management team which took control of Wickes four years ago when it was bankrupt and its shares were suspended. He said his Wickes shares and share options meant that he stood to receive about \u00a31.5m as a result of the new offer. </p> <p>\"It has not been decided whether we will stay with the company,\" he added. </p> <p>He said he was not disappointed that Wickes was losing its independence. \"I am very pragmatic. My job was to do the best for shareholders.\" </p> <p>Since the first Focus bid lapsed, Wickes had returned \u00a370m to shareholders. Now it had secured a bid worth \u00a3289m. \"I think we have done a great job for shareholders,\" he said. </p> <p>Wickes and Focus are the third and fourth largest home improvement chains in the country, though Wickes concentrates on the heavier end of the market. The businesses combined will have a 10.7% market share. </p> <p>Bill Archer, chairman and chief executive of Focus, said: \"The combination of Wickes and Focus Do It All will bring together both light- and heavy-end DIY product offerings. </p> <p>\"It will create a business with the scale necessary to compete with the larger industry players in an increasingly competitive and consolidating industry.\" </p> <p>Neither company would comment on possible job losses. Wickes has 4,400 employees and Focus 7,000. </p> <p>Wickes's 131 stores, which are in the middle of an ambitious revamp, sell goods such as kitchens, tools and lighting whereas Focus' 200 stores sell traditional DIY, craft and pet products. </p> <p>Mr Grimsey managed to defeat Focus' original two month long takeover attempt by winning the support of leading institutional shareholders who backed his plans for restructuring Wickes. </p> <p>The main shareholders in privately-owned Focus are its management and funds managed by Duke Street Capital. Wickes' shares closed 75p higher at 487.5p, just below the 495p-a-share offer price.</p>",
  "<p>The clockwork accuracy of the Swiss could be imported into the rail industry, following the announcement yesterday that Swiss Rail is making a bid to take over a slice of commuter services into Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. </p> <p>The firm, which is owned by the Swiss government but operates as a separate trading company, joins the French and Dutch, who are competing to retain or win new rail franchises serving the capital. </p> <p>The company is joining Laing Investments, part of the construction firm, John Laing Group, to bid for the Thames Trains and Wessex franchises. </p> <p>Swiss Rail has a reputation for quality and punctuality, and is one of Europe's most highly used railways, all electrified. The company has been successful in attracting people to use rail for a higher proportion of journeys than most other countries in Europe. </p> <p>Its boast is that it provides passengers with the same timetable each hour, 365 days of the year, with no disruption from engineering work. Railtrack could not come close to matching that, although unlike the Swiss, it is not responsible for operating services. </p> <p>Laing was also attracted to the Swiss because the state-owned railway ensures that trains connect with each other at the same time every hour - and with trains, buses, trams and ferries in the same way. </p> <p>It issues tickets which can be used on every form of public transport and rail cards that are used by more than half the population. The company also provides a level of customer service unheard of in Britain and 99% of its daily 750,000 passengers are satisfied. In Britain, some 2m people use the rail network each day - and less than half the travelling public has expressed real satisfaction. </p> <p>The Swiss network incorporates Advanced Train Protection, the safety system on trains still to be introduced throughout Britain's network. It has been fought off by the industry here because of its high cost. All main line stations in Switzerland have luggage check-in facilities. </p> <p>Laing's subsidiary company, M40 Trains, already owns Chiltern Trains, which last month had its franchise extended for another 20 years. It is the first of its type to be awarded by the shadow Strategic Rail Authority. </p> <p>Andy Friend, managing director of Laing Investments and Benedict Weibel, chief executive of Swiss Rail, enthusiastically welcomed the new partnership. They said it was dedicated to providing passengers with \"a quality of rail service that has never previously existed in the UK\". </p> <p>They said that the franchise would be at the heart of an integrated transport network, which would provide a real alternative to the car. </p> <p>Governmment figures issued yesterday showed that \u00a32.2bn of private money was invested in the rail industry last year, almost double the \u00a31.3bn government subsidy. </p> <p>Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, compared this to the heydays of the 1950s, although around \u00a32bn came from Railtrack alone.</p>",
  "<p>Pikachu, Vileplume, Mankey and other members of the Pok\u00e9mon menagerie will invade the Millennium Dome this weekend for a funfest of games and adventures.</p> <p> It is a suitable setting for a children's craze which will probably be swept away within a few years by something new. </p> <p>Remember Cabbage Patch dolls and the tamagotchi electronics pets? All the rage one minute and forgotten the next. But during their brief appearance, pocket money was gobbled up and parents were driven to distraction. </p> <p>But Pok\u00e9mon has been a nice little earner for Nintendo, the Japanese video games group, even though it shares the rights to the name with two other companies, Creatures and Game Freak. Pok\u00e9mon, short for pocket monster, started out as a game for Nintendo's Game Boy. It is now a $5bn (\u00a33.4bn) franchise industry encompassing T-shirts, cameras, bikes, a film and a television series. </p> <p>The avidly collected cards featuring Pok\u00e9mon characters are a throwback to Nintendo's 19th century roots. </p> <p><strong> Small roots</strong><br> </p> <p> Nintendo was founded in 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi as a small business making highly decorative Japanese Hanafuda playing cards and selling them from a shop in Kyoto. Within 10 years, the firm was making conventional playing cards, initially for export and then for sale in Japan. </p> <p>Renamed the Nintendo Playing Card Company in 1953, it started to mass produce plastic backed playing cards. Sales soared in 1959 when it started to make cards featuring Walt Disney characters for children. The seeds of Pok\u00e9mon's later success were sown. </p> <p>But Nintendo's most significant change came in the 1970s when it added electronic toys to its range of games. Its target-shooting Beam Gun, which used opto-electronics, went on sale at the start of the decade. It is thought to be the first Japanese toy to incorporate electronics. </p> <p>The company later developed a laser-based clay pigeon shooting system which it hoped would fill former bowling alleys standing empty following the game's decline in Japan. Then the company started making amusement arcade games. Within a few years it replaced the 16mm film used in its coin-operated arcade machines with an electronic video player which it developed with Mitsubishi Electric. The two companies then used the system to make arcade games for home use. </p> <p>The founder's grandson Hiroshi Yamauchi, who is now the company's autocratic boss, faced a crisis when one of his arcade games, Radarscope, flopped. He signed up a young artist, Sigeru Miyamoto, to quickly convert it into something that would sell. </p> <p><strong> Smash hit</strong><br> </p> <p> Miyamoto, who was to become Nintendo's star games designer, decided to break away from the \"shoot-'em-up\" games that were all the rage. He created an adventure game, Donkey Kong, which involved a small carpenter having to find a way to rescue his beautiful girlfriend from a gorilla with attitude and humour. </p> <p>Nintendo salesmen were horrified. It would not sell, they said. But it did, becoming Nintendo's first smash hit. </p> <p>The group's US business, Nintendo of America, was struggling to survive. Its small staff also thought Donkey Kong would go down like a lead balloon. Also before they could sell it, they had to produce English text for its opening scene. They named the central character after their landlord, Mario, who had interrupted their deliberations to complain about unpaid rent. </p> <p>Mario, transformed into a plumber in later games, was to become Nintendo's first super-hero. Donkey Kong and its successors sold like hot cakes, the American business was saved, and its parent made a fortune. </p> <p>The US entertainment giant MCA Universal sued Nintendo. They claimed that Donkey Kong infringed Universal Studios' King Kong rights. MCA lost its action in the US Supreme Court. It ended up having to pay Nintendo $1.8m. </p> <p>Yamauchi tried to dominate the home video games market by producing cheaper hardware than his competitors and supplying more exciting games. He told wholesalers that while they might make a loss on the games machines, they would more than recoup it through sales of the games' cartridges. He preferred cartridges to CD-Roms because they were difficult to copy. However last week the company announced that its Gamecube, to be launched next year, would use an 8cm optical disk. </p> <p>Nintendo has kept an iron grip on the creation, production and marketing of games which can be played on its machines. Christoper Stamper, one of three brothers who run a British games software company called Rare, spent six months working out Nintendo's key technical specifications through reverse engineering. Rare's first game for a Nintendo machine impressed the Japanese firm which later brought a 25% stake in the business. The company has since developed many Nintendo games. </p> <p><strong> Fight for space</strong><br> </p> <p> The video games industry has always been a battlefield in which the players have tried to use new technology to make faster machines capable of handling ever-more complex graphics and games play. Many companies have pulled out, collapsed, or switched to making pure computers, leaving Sony, Nintendo and Sega to fight it out among themselves. However the scene looks likely to change: Microsoft is to enter the arena next year. </p> <p>Home games machines were initially plugged into televisions. Then, in 1989 Nintendo introduced the Game Boy, the first portable hand-held video game system which played different games stored on cartridges. </p> <p>Nintendo is now established as the world's second largest video games company, trailing just behind Sony. It has moved so far from its playing card roots that it has had to licence the making of the Pok\u00e9mon cards to other firms.</p>",
  "<p>It is getting on for 20 years since the then energy secretary, Nigel Lawson, devised the concept of the golden share as a way of soothing fears that a privatised Britoil might fall into \"unsuitable\" - that is, foreign - hands. </p> <p>In the event, the Britoil golden share came back to haunt the government when the company came under seige from BP in 1987. Although BP was hardly an \"unsuitable\" owner, the ownership issue was particularly sensitive because Britoil was regarded as Scotland's most important company and opinion was pressing the government to use the golden share to ensure control of Britoil remained in Scotland. </p> <p>Occasional political embarrassments, however, have not discouraged the development of the golden shares. They have become common currency in privatisation programmes - both in the UK and elsewhere. </p> <p>Purists might argue that the concept of the golden share sits oddly with the philosophy underpinning privatisation. Where is the logic in governments deciding organisations are better suited to the private sector but then retaining ultimate say over ownership? Then again, when have governments put logic ahead of political expediency? </p> <p>Despite the passage of almost two decades since Mr Lawson came up with the idea, the golden share is not a matter for economic textbooks. </p> <p>The UK government, for example, retains golden shares in a number of con cerns. This week the Portuguese government made it clear that it will retain a golden share in Portugal Telecom when it sells off its final stake in the firm later this year. </p> <p>That might prove irritating for an ambitious telco which might have fancied entering the Portuguese market via a bid for Portugal Telecom - especially if the said telco was one of those which has had to shell out billions to European governments for third-generation mobile telephone licences. </p> <p>But Portuguese caution cannot be dismissed or seen solely in terms of old-fashioned domestic political preoccupations. Some of the telcos which might come knocking on Portugal Telecom's door have market capitalisations not far removed from Portugal's gross domestic product. </p> <p>Portugal is not the only country concerned about the growth of corporate power in areas regarded as politically and economically important. On Thursday, Belgium's energy minister, Olivier Deleuze, expressed his anxieties about the prospects of a link-up (subsequently denied) between German utilities group E.ON and France's Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux. </p> <p> No wonder. The latter has a huge presence in Belgium's gas and electricity market through its ownership of Tractebel. Mr Deleuze said: \"I am concerned about the future of Tractebel and that the promises given to maintain Belgian control over decision-making don't seem able to resist market forces.\" </p> <p>Shades of Britoil again: a combination of E.ON and Suez Lyonnaise would have a market capitalisation of about 25% of Belgium's total output. In such circumstances the Belgian government may well be concerned about its ability to in fluence events that will have an impact on its citizens' lives. </p> <p>There are those who would argue that globalisation means corporate power - to paraphrase an 18th century House of Commons motion about the crown - that it \"has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished\". </p> <p>In 1992 - albeit in a slightly different context - the British authorities found, like Mr Deleuze, that market forces were difficult to control as sterling was ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism. Others would suggest that if big corporates are to be confronted it must be by big governments - although the current travails of the euro suggest that size is not everything. </p> <p> B ut where does all this leave the ordinary citizen? The flippant answer these days might be \"watching Big Brother\". It may not be a bad starting point, odd though that may seem to those who believe such goldfish-bowl television is an ill-starred mismatch of Crossroads and the Roman method of deciding the fate of defeated gladiators. </p> <p>The crucial point is that however much you may dislike the concept on which the programme is based, viewers feel involved. They are drawn into what is happening and then vote on what should happen next. They are part of the decision-making process not every five years but every week. </p> <p>Nor is their participation being sought by those who too often give the impression that the whole thing is an unfortunate necessity but by those who use the very level of participation as a yardstick of success. </p> <p>It should be worth considering how the postive aspects of such a series might be adapted for rather more serious purposes than a programme like Big Brother. No doubt if some one does, our governments will want a golden share of that, too.</p>",
  "<p>Yippee skippee! According to doctors at Edinburgh University, we may well be looking at a safe, effective and commercially available male Pill some time over the next five years. Why, then, does my heart not skip a beat in sheer molten gratitude, as the men in white coats believe the hearts of all sexually active women across the nation should? </p> <p>Lots of reasons, actually; let's start with the ignoble, demeaning cliche. Are women, who are notoriously better at remembering things than men, really going to gamble with their hard-won controlled fertility on the backs of a breed who can barely remember one birthday and one anniversary a year, let alone to take a pill more than 200 times during it? And, at the risk of sounding like an Anthony Trollope novel, Do You Really Trust Him?</p> <p>I know well from talking to my younger friends that these days it is often the male half of a couple who yearns to hear the patter of tiny trainers, while the distaff side desires nothing more than to concentrate on her career before she comes anywhere near having that greasy stuff smeared on her stomach so they can give her a scan. Take one broody man, one woman with an irrational prejudice against abortion, stir in the male Pill and voila! - a liar's charter. </p> <p>Not only does the male Pill hold the possibility of making your man into a liar, don't you think that, even supposing he remembers to take it and you remain childless, it makes him a bit of a daddy, too? Your daddy, that is: there is something rather unwholesomely I can't-handle-this-nasty-contraception-thing-look-after-me-please about handing responsibility for your sexuality over to someone else. </p> <p>And it works both ways; not only does he become The Boss, but you become a Good Girl, rather more so than is good for any romantic relationship. If you're handing over contraception duties to him, your husband/boyfriend's going to trust you a touch too much; if there's no chance of anybody but him picking them apples, they're going to start looking not half as juicy.</p> <p>This is not to say that actively attempting to make your spouse jealous is anything but pathetic. But on the other hand, what he imagines you getting up to on your nights off is nothing to do with you. Many studies show that the stronger the suspicion that his gal is not altogether dead from the waist down where other men are concerned, the more your average man makes a big effort to be good in bed. The old chestnut \"Treat 'em mean and keep 'em keen\", always the fastest way to become catnip to boys, mutates into \"Keep 'em sure and be a bore\" when we imagine a male pill. </p> <p>Then there's the fact that I like a quiet life, as I'm sure you do. After two marriages of (to paraphrase Living Doll) screaming, squawking, keening, sulking hysterics, I am now lucky enough to be going steady with a young man of almost unbelievable sweet temper. Long exposure to such sunniness has rendered me, too, extremely easy-going and barely recognisable as my uptight 80s self, and I have no desire to return to this tormented state.</p> <p>One of the main reasons for marital discord is, I believe, the mad, modern desire to share everything, from household tasks to bank accounts. The key to domestic harmony, on the other hand, is to divide everything, so that each has his job and doesn't interfere with the other one. Hence I would no more dream of letting my boyfriend drive my fertility than I would dream of trying to drive his car. Stick to what you're best at, and happiness will result. </p> <p>Let's face it, romantic relationships are full of arguments just waiting to happen, and sharing rather than dividing tasks is the quickest way to end up in a whirlwind of resentment and martyrdom; it also leaves women wide open to that eternal dirty dig of \"nagging\". And there's worse. If you get pregnant through your own miscalculations or poor memory skills, you're going to breathe a quick \"Ooo! Stupid cow\" before booking that lunchtime termination. If he gets you pregnant through his own inefficiency or idleness, the potential for relationship-wrecking fights is limitless. You're not going to forgive him quickly, if at all. </p> <p>Then again, it's political. Women fought and died and worried their brains in order to help you gain control of your one and only body. Are you really happy to hand yours over to a man, no matter how benign, just because bothering with contraception is a \"drag\"? Yeah, voting's pretty annoying, innit, having to drag yourself down to the polling station - I know, why not let your husband vote for you, too? Then you'll have even more time to spend at the hairdresser. </p> <p> As politicians are always telling us, you can't have rights without responsibilities. If this is so, it's very likely that the reverse is true, too. Let a man share responsibility for your reproductive system, and before long he is going to feel that he has rights over it; in short, he is going to become one of those men you hear of in America who burst into the operating room just before aforementioned lunchtime abortion and start screaming scary crap about it being his ickle baby, too! </p> <p>My last reason for being sceptical about a male Pill is the most embarrassing, and the hardest to put across without sounding as though I have swallowed one too many Black Lace books, but bear with me. I actually like the idea of aggressive, rampaging sperm, and of my duty as a healthy, modern, selfish woman to evade and frustrate them at every turn. </p> <p>Day in and day out, the sexually active woman who refuses to obey Nature's dictat that she becomes a walking incubator once a year for 20 years scores a near triumph against the tyranny of biology: if the man's firing blanks to begin with, it does rob us of our victory somewhat.</p> <p>In the eternal battle between sperm and ovum, I want to be Bette Davis, walking all over the opposition in Fuck-Me shoes; I don't want to be Jennifer Aniston, muddling meekly through with a lot of help from her friends. And while I may be an extreme case, I feel that for a lot of women the merest likelihood of conception makes sex more exciting; I've only known one girl who was married to a man who had a vasectomy, and whereas before she had been perfectly faithful to him, within three weeks she had run off with an imperfect stranger she met at a party. Mind you, the dumped hubster was a sexually repellent premature ejaculator, so that might have had some bearing on it. </p> <p>Phew, that's better. But to get back to basics, I would suggest that if a woman is so loathe to organise something as fundamental as her own fertility, it could be a sign that she isn't that interested in sex anyway - \"He wants it so much, let him arrange it!\" - in which case, perhaps you simply shouldn't be doing it at all. Now there is a revolutionary thought.</p>",
  "<p>My reflections last week on the sad deaths of artists have produced a ripe crop of further examples, most of them new to me. ER Carter of Ventnor has sent me what he modestly calls a \"little list\" of musical deaths, and an incomplete one, but it seems quite a big one to me. In chronological order, these are the cases he cites: </p> <p>Jean Baptiste Lully (1687) used to conduct by stamping a staff on the floor. One day, no doubt while trying to inspire a crescendo, he put the staff through his foot and died of the subsequent gangrene. </p> <p>Johann Schobert (1767; not to be confused with the rather more eminent Schubert) died with his household after eating poisonous fungi. Grove's musical dictionary says that one small child survived. </p> <p>The pianist/composer Alkan (1888) died when a wardrobe fell on him. </p> <p>C\u00e9sar Franck (1890) died after being hit by a shaft of a horsedrawn omnibus, which brought on a fatal attack of pleurisy: this is one of two cases in this fresh bout of evidence in which transport was involved. </p> <p>Eduard Strauss (1916), brother of the more famous Johann the younger, and a conductor rather more than a composer, fell off a rostrum after a brain haemorrhage. </p> <p>Granados (1916) and Mrs Granados died when their ship encountered a German torpedo.</p> <p> Alban Berg (1935) died of blood posioning after a bee sting; and Anton von Webern (a famous case, this one) was accidentally shot by a US soldier who mistook him for a black marketeer in 1945. </p> <p>\u0095 Then there is the death of Thomas Love Peacock. In a book called Famous Last Words, compiled by Jonathon Green, it is stated that Peacock was burned to death while trying to save his library from a fire. His last words are said to have been: \"By the immortal God, I will not move.\" A friend has lent me a life of Peacock by JB Priestley - not your obvious Peacockophile: too dour: but his book is deeply enjoyable - which does not quite confirm this story. According to Priestley, Peacock, then 80 and something of a recluse, had a morbid fear of fire, and did indeed utter this cry of defiance when a fire duly occurred. But these would not have been his last words; he survived the fire - only to fall into a fatal decline. </p> <p> \u0095 And what (you must surely be asking by now) about the death of Alexander Zemlinsky? Apart from the date (1942), Grove has nothing to tell us here. But what's clear about Zemlinsky, as Dr RF Carter of Putney points out (what a great week for Carters! I hope to hear more from more Carters in future) is that he is always being traduced. Traduced, that is, if you call it traduction to be assigned to the second Viennese school by people who seem think that it practised relentless cacophony. Dr Carter singles out for especial disdain a columnist in the Observer who suggested that Zemlinsky was unlikely to figure on Vladimir Putin's list for Desert Island Discs - thus implying (Dr Carter suggests) that Zemlinsky was a) a blight on the ear and b) Russian rather than Austrian. Knowing nothing of Zemlinsky, I borrowed a disc from the record library and can now confirm Dr Carter's view that his music is no more rebarbative than, say, Mahler's. The work I heard was quite Brahmsy and pretty Wagnery. He may have been Schoenberg's father-in-law but demanding he certainly wasn't; if anything, a bit on the soppy side.</p> <p> <strong> A pedant writes: </strong> There is no such word as traduction. I think what you mean is traducement.</p> <p><strong> Smallweed responds with a lascivious sneer: </strong> If it's all the same to you, old fruit, I think I shall stick to traduction. When you were last seduced, did you not call it seduction? </p> <p>\u0095 The final test of the England-West Indies series may be over by now, so perhaps it is time for a word on the much-praised Channel 4 coverage - so much better, people keep saying, than the lazy old BBC's. Smallweed cannot entirely agree. I like some innovations, especially Simon Hughes's subtle analyses from his dungeon. But I find the sudden switches from cricket to ads unsettling. A generation is growing up which will come to think of cricket as a game in which, as soon as a bowler has bowled his sixth ball, someone tries to sell you a Renault. </p> <p>\u0095 Someone has pinned on a noticeboard not far from Smallweed's head a cutting torn from something called The Sinderwood Stroll, by Bob Footslog (maybe a pseudonym?): \"Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Every day I walk myself into a state of wellbeing, and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my very best thoughts, and I know of no walk so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it; but sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill - thus if one just keeps walking, everything will be all right.\" That is Kierkegaard. I shall ponder it in a moment or two as I stroll the length of the Balls Pond Road to the point where it meets the A10 at Dalston. It's suggested that one of the ancients - it's not clear which one, but no doubt some Carter or Carters will know the answer - summed it up rather better in the words: solvitur ambulando. But that's hardly enough to keep one going all the way down the Balls Pond Road. </p> <p>\u0095 More unfinished business. The allegation that \"step change\" derives from the practice of marching armies has been challenged on various counts. It relates to the thrills and spills of the world of accountancy, having to do - according to a correspondent clearly well versed in these matters - with the way costs are laid out in graphs as production increases. And the alias under which TE Lawrence signed up for the RAF under the watchful eye of the creator of Biggles was Ross, not Shaw: he changed to Shaw later, having been rumbled. And how did he die, you may ask? In a motorcycle accident.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"mailto:smallweed@theguardian.com\">smallweed@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>I met John Turturro in New York, in his beautiful Brooklyn brownstone, which may once have housed five families but which is now the home for himself, his wife the actress Katherine Borowitz, their son Amedeo, and soon-to-be child due in December.</p> <p>Later, in a midsummer monsoon, he drove me back to Manhattan. He was on his way to a meeting with the producer of the television drama The Sopranos; there is a part that they'd like him to consider.</p> <p>\"Somehow I don't see John in The Sopranos, do you?\" Katherine had said. </p> <p>Driving, he explained: \"He is a powerful man. And in this business you have to be polite.\"</p> <p>Following the meeting, he was going back to Brooklyn to stay the night with his mother, take her to hospital the next day for a cataract operation, probably stay with her that night, too. \"I'll call to let you know when I'll be home,\" he told his wife. Then slung a few clothes into an overnight bag, put on a full length plastic windcheater, tied up the hood and went round the block to fetch the car. There is a modest ease about this man. Which is not to say he's not intense. There is a kind of tension in his very bearing, 6ft 1in and densely packed - a former athlete, a great dancer - that translates on the screen into a powerful, visceral presence. It's not difficult to imagine that he could be hard work. But what he's not doing is hiding. </p> <p>In the car he had told me about the time he was rung by Stanley Kubrick. \"He wanted me for a part in Eyes Wide Shut.\" Turturro was interested. He chooses most of his parts according to who the director is. \"But I was busy directing my second film, Illuminata, and couldn't be free for six months, and that's not the way that Kubrick worked. He wanted total commitment from the beginning.\"</p> <p>Afterwards, when he saw the film, he was glad not to have been in it. \"It was so childish, stupid. The idea that a man can't handle his wife's fantasies. Everyone has fantasies, everyone is tempted. It's part of all our experience. It's how you act on those fantasies.\"</p> <p>And, as he says, it happens all the time in movies, actors falling for each other. It happened to him once. Once in the 20 years that he and Katherine have been together he fell for someone else. \"That was hard for everyone.\" In the end, nothing happened. He didn't act on it. \"Because I know that an action can hurt a person, really hurt them. And when you know this and you love someone, you can't do it, even though you may want to do it.\" </p> <p>Funnily enough, this is the subject of Illuminata, previously a play entitled Imperfect Love written by his good friend Brandon Cole, and adapted as a screenplay by Turturro. Somehow, without knowing it, and simultaneously, he was working on the perfect antidote to Kubrick's cloying sentimental drama, making a film \"about staying in love rather than falling in or falling out of love - that middle period, the one we're all involved with\".</p> <p>The film hasn't had a release in Europe. Go see it, he said, before you leave the States. \"It has a lot of me in it. It will tell you a lot about me.\" Where is the lie, the film asks. In falling for someone? No. Where is the hurt? In admitting it - to yourself, to another? Some hurt maybe. But the far bigger lie, the bigger hurt is in concealment. Because how can you love when part of you is hidden and, more to the point, how can you be loved if you don't allow yourself to be seen? </p> <p>Translate this into his work, which he also loves - I don't think I have ever met an actor so passionately critical of his job. How do you remain faithful to an idea of acting that you had as a scholarship kid at Yale Drama School before you became a movie actor, when idealism was the air that everyone breathed. It was easy then, a couple of off-off-Broadway plays a year - Ibsen, Ionesco, John Patrick Shanley - everyone in the same boat, broke, filling in time teaching or working on a construction site. Then, if you took a bit part in Exterminator 2, it wasn't you that was involved, it wasn't your heart - it was more like a high school date, something you did to pass the time while you waited for the real thing to come along.</p> <p>He got typecast early on in movies. \"Violent, volatile characters and stuff\", like the character of Heinz in Tony Bill's 1988 film 5 Corners, a psychotic who throws his mother out of a first-floor window and kills his girlfriend Jodie Foster's pet penguin. The suave accomplice in Michael Cimino's The Sicilian. The pool hustler in Scorsese's The Color Of Money. But since these were the films that got him noticed, he's loyal to them. \"After all, there's a humanity in violence, in brutality.\" </p> <p>Then he got lucky, his word. In the late 80s, early 90s he began his collaboration with the directors Spike Lee and with the Coen Brothers, playing Pino, Danny Aiello's racist son in Do The Right Thing, and Bernie Bernbaum in the Coens' Miller's Crossing - still nasties, but in both films forcing his way against type, bringing the audience in, which is his great gift, so that you feel for these otherwise loathsome creatures. You see them subjectively not objectively.</p> <p>Playing the snivelling bully Bernie Bernbaum, he says he remembered a time as a kid when someone pulled a gun on him and suddenly everything slowed down and started going backwards. \"And I thought, that's how Bernie views the world\" - ie, through a lens of fear. It is a definitive portrayal of cowardice, and when Tom, Gabriel Byrne's character, shoots him at point-blank range through the head, it becomes a judgment on Tom not on Bernie - though no one ever deserved it more. </p> <p>\"I don't judge characters,\" Turturro has said, \"I just play them.\" Like he doesn't judge people and doesn't expect or invite judgment. \"I am what I do.\" So if he doesn't like something he just moves away from it? \"No,\" he says. \"I can be confrontational, I've got a temper, I get edgy when I am under pressure. But mostly my feet are on the ground and I know if it's my fault.\" </p> <p>There was no conscious decision about his career. \"Just when I found I had a bit of choice, I started to pick roles that were more challenging and difficult, because that interests me. I like films in which people come out sensitised, thinking - because I like it when that's done to me.\"</p> <p> Could he be tempted now by a blockbuster such as Mission Impossible or Gladiator? \"Sure,\" he says. \"Absolutely, I could be tempted. But I've made the decisions I've made. If I were to do the other thing, make movies that are escapist or entertainment, I'd be richer, but I don't know what I'd do with the money. Buy a bigger house. Have plastic surgery maybe.\" </p> <p>Somehow, whenever he's been offered \"big\" movies there has always been something else going on, something he wants to do more. \"They wanted me for Men In Black, a good film for what it was. But I was about to make Francesco Rosi's The Truce, adapted from Primo Levi's book, about an Auschwitz survivor, a film I'd been involved with for five years, so there was no choice for me.\" He turned down Home Alone. \"That was because I didn't realise how big it would be.\" You can always regret things, he says. \"You could say I should have done Home Alone, because then I would have had the money to buy our house sooner. We could have had our babies sooner\" - a genuine anxiety when your wife is 43 and expecting a second child. \"But do I regret it creatively? No.\" </p> <p>Everyone has their own way of doing things: take Ralph Fiennes, whom he acted opposite in Quiz Show. \"Ralph's found a way to do what he wants to do. He'll do a little bit of the other stuff and then go off and do a Chekhov or something. Other people have a struggle 'I have to do all these things just in order to do this.' It's a high price to pay.\" And it doesn't always pay off. \"I remember when I first saw Gary Oldman, he was a great good actor, one of the most exciting actors I've seen.\" Now, so many villains down the line, I guess Turturro thinks he lost it. \"How many crazy guys can you do... and when you could do so much more. I don't know if that's what's happened to him, his film [Nil By Mouth] was great. But there is only so much of that stuff you can do and then people start to see you differently. I think sometimes you may be better off if you don't do that.\" </p> <p>George Clooney, he says, has cracked it. Clooney he has just finished working with on the Coens' O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a hillbilly romp and a musical, with Clooney as a kind of Ulysses figure, an escaped con, trying to find his way back to his home and the woman he loves. Turturro plays one of his two accomplices. \"George is a nice guy, very talented and very smart. He knows where he's at and he's made the system work for him. He made his money in TV and now he can do what he wants in films. He's still learning about film; he's come from TV, he works very fast, he wants everything done in one. But he's trying to do what he can. I am a fan.\" </p> <p>When Turturro talks like this he is not being covertly bitchy. Most actors don't talk critically or analytically about the system they work in - except sometimes to rubbish Hollywood - but then it's always the studios, the anonymous autonomy. Everything with Turturro is personal, subjective. It's his way of being. Like he said about his fantasies. If I am not straight with you, then who will be straight with me when my turn comes round? If there were only one thing to be said about Turturro, it is that he is not afraid. </p> <p>The Coen Brothers put it better, and more revealingly - certainly in terms of the actor. \"It's amazing how he allows himself to be humiliated in front of the camera.\" Humiliation is a tricky word, with its connotations of self-abasement. This kind of humiliation is Bernie Bernbaum pleading for his life, instead of taking the bullet like a man, as his macho world insists. But there's another kind of humiliation that is at the extreme end of embarrassment, in which you see yourself as you are seen. The ability to do this, to expose yourself at will and in public, is acting - anything else is simply playing at acting. </p> <p>Turturro has said that he learned everything he knows about acting from his father, who was an Italian immigrant construction worker. An honest guy, \"to a fault\", extremely physical, tough, and violent. He frightened his three sons. Turturro is the middle child: \"Always in the middle, always juggling, that's where I stand in life.\" And no doubt he frightened his wife. He used to hit her, \"not a lot, but it did happen\", and it was always John who intervened. \"For some reason my older brother was more afraid than I.\" His mother, he says, always knew \"I'd hit my father if he went too far\".</p> <p>So he grew up in Queens, in a house \"where you always had to be aware that something could happen because of his temper\". And that gave him an ability to read situations, to sense what was going on. \"It was a great house to grow up in if you wanted to be an actor. You lived moment to moment, there was a lot of black humour.\" They'd all play it carefully, \"follow my mother's lead, never come on to him\". And so he learned \"that if you do something to someone it has a repercussion\". </p> <p>This is what acting is about, he says. You do something and you follow it through to the next move and then the next - a bit like a game of chess - constantly alert to the new possibility. In bad actors, he says, you see this mistake all the time - \"They do something and you want to tell them, 'You can't do that and be so relaxed about it because you don't know what will happen, you haven't thought it out.' It's hard to explain this to someone who hasn't had my kind of experience.\" </p> <p>And yet he says he loved his father. \"We had a good relationship. I kind of understood him.\" He understood the brutality of his father's world, having no money and the powerlessness of that. How powerlessness leads to bullying. How no one is one thing. \"He could be very sensitive, too, and funny. He talked a lot and about everything.\" He taught him some good things - about passion, about loving work. \"He was never sloppy, never lazy.\" And about a kind of immersion, of personalising things. \"If my father was watching a movie, he was in that movie.\" </p> <p>After his father died of a heart attack Turturro found it very hard to get over the loss. \"The fact that you don't see that person again, that you can't have him again.\" His mother told him that even in his deathbed delirium he was talking about work back at the construction site, ordering people around, \"where he had been happy\". In 1989, soon after his death, Turturro wrote and directed a largely autobiographical film, Mac, based on his father and his childhood experience of his family, in which he played his father and which in 1992 won Best First Film Award at Cannes. He had originally written it as a play with Brandon Cole in 1980. He spent 12 years getting it to the screen. He didn't make it out of respect for his father - \"Not only that. It seemed to me you don't see films about people like this, no education, no privilege. There are a lot of worlds whose stories are never told. I didn't want to make a sentimental portrait of Italian home life. I wanted it warts and all.\" Watching it later, he was surprised \"at how uninhibited I was\". </p> <p>As a kid he took all the responsibility, \"just about all of it\", and that's continued into his adult life. \"I'd do anything I can to help. I have no qualms about being the one that can make things better - give them money, buy them something. I'll lie, be inventive if I have to, if there's something I can do for one of them. When they're okay, then I can do my stuff.\" His elder brother has had drug problems: \"He was always fragile. Probably he needed help when he was young and he didn't get it. By the time he did it was too late.\" His younger brother s an actor: \"He has a lot of talent, but I don't know if he's ever going to get out of himself all that he could.\" As he says, there are repercussions. </p> <p>He has never been a depressive, he says. \"I think you have to have a predisposition to that, and if I get blue I try to put it into something, incorporate it into something I am doing.\" He gets emotional. \"But emotion is not depressing.\" And he gets irritated - that some of what he considers to be his finest work has not been widely acclaimed; that a film such as Francesco Rosi's The Truce, in which he played Primo Levi - \"a great film from a great book written by one of the greatest writers about the Holocaust\" - got almost no audience compared with a film such as Life Is Beautiful.</p> <p>\"Of course it bothers me. That our wonderful, meditative, non histrionic film didn't do as well as it deserved. And you see a film like that and how successful it can be and it's just a fairy-tale. You'd think there could have been a place for something else, that people could have been moved by something that showed the other side of the fairy-tale. But that's how it is. That's the nature of the beast. I work here and it's a market place that's very adolescent.\" Time, anyway, he says, is the test of greatness. \"It took a long time for Levi to find a publisher for his book. I think The Truce will survive. Time will be good to it.\" </p> <p>He is an optimist, in his life, in his work, but also a pragmatist. He chooses carefully, the people around him. \"I don't like to be around people who are neurotic.\" And the people he works with. He has made four films with the Coens, who are great, he says. \"I have never been unhappy. They always ask me to do things they haven't seen me do, and anything I've done they have always made look better. That's a lot in movies. They wrote Barton Fink for me. What more can you ask? And as people they are kind, thoughtful, together, talented, not macho. If their films were half as good as they are I'd still want to work with them because of the kind of people they are.\" Ditto Spike Lee. Though he has some criticisms, of Jungle Fever in particular. \"My side story was so much stronger than the central character in that film. I think at one time he wanted to make it the main character, I think he would have... but he didn't.\" They are still good friends. \"He just hasn't had that much for me recently. You know, you work well with someone, you think you'll work together more. But then, no. That's how it is. When my friends have roles for me I am thrilled to do it. I love it.\" </p> <p>He has three films opening shortly: the Coens' O Brother, Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried, and Dutch director Marleen Gorris's The Luzhin Defence, from a Nabakov novella, in which he plays the lead. It is not his best film. \"There are a couple of things I am disappointed about, little things that didn't make it in.\" But, as he says, it's a hard book and hard to adapt - movies have to simplify. \"Favourite things go as you try to make it more understandable. Really, I have to see it a couple more times before I can say.\"</p> <p>In lots of ways I think he'll be pleased. There are all sorts of criticisms that can be made of the film as an adaptation. It has become a morality tale, in a way Nabakov never intended. It's far too explicit, the introduction of a demonic character, not in the book, over-simplifies. The ending is so compressed as to be unrecognisable. But it doesn't matter. Turturro is wonderful as Luzhin, a grand chess master who comes to the Italian lakes to play the tournament of his life and falls in love. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role, except maybe Pacino before he played The Godfather. So, impossible, in other words. </p> <p>Nabakov wrote it as the story of a man who can't get outside his own head. Chess, the only thing he knows how to do, and consequently the only thing he loves, will kill him, and yet he can't survive without it. \"I have seen that with people I have known and it is a tragedy.\" In Turturro's portrayal, you see the man he could have been, if only. It is Chekhovian in that way, or maybe Russian in that way. A kind of Vanya, but years younger before he became cynical. Luzhin, trying so hard not to lose sight of himself, can't see anybody else. He tries and he fails.</p> <p> Watching it you find yourself thinking that in other hands it could have been a great film. The definitive role for Turturro, a culmination of so much work that has gone before. The cowardice of Bernie. The egotism of Barton Fink. The kind of felt but never integrated physicality of his father in Mac. Plus a kind of modulated elegance, when he dances, when he is making love to Emily Watson, that I have never seen in Turturro before. </p> <p>All he has ever wanted of film, he says, is to be able to develop, not to repeat himself. Imperfection is his element, he learned it early on, and it is, to use one of his favourite words, his humanity. There was a time, he tells me, when he was young and so embarrassed by the size of his nose that he'd sit in class with his hand covering one side so that the beautiful girl on his left couldn't see it. \"A whole year I did that, maybe more.\" </p> <p>In Illuminata, he wrote these lines for the leading lady, played by his wife Katherine. \"I am imperfect... Born imperfect, educated imperfectly... moulded in my formative years by imperfect hands... If you look for someone to love you imperfectly, look no further.\"</p> <p>There's a lot of me in that, he had told me. There is a lot of all of us in that </p> <p>\u0095 The Luzhin Defence opens on September 8, O Brother, Where Art Thou? on September 15.</p>",
  "<p>Authors, actors and accountants have always worked for themselves. But with changing job patterns, those in occupations such as nursing, teaching and computing services are now often also self-employed. And that can be a red light when it comes to mortgages. </p> <p>Around one in eight of the workforce is now wholly or partly their own boss with around 10,000 each week trying to go it alone for the first time. But only a small minority of home loan companies have woken up to this change by offering \"self-certification\" deals where customers do not have to produce documentary proof of earnings. </p> <p>The great majority continue to lump the self-employed - and those who set up their own one-person or family companies - as bad risks along with mortgage defaulters and fraudsters. </p> <p>\"Self-employment smacks of dodgy dealings in financial services circles,\" says Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses. \"They're seen as tainted and lumped together with bankrupts. Most lenders are not interested and our members complain that those which even bother to reply to enquires often charge an arm and a leg in interest rates.\" </p> <p>And if they grant loans, they insist on two or often three years' worth of audited accounts, disadvantaging those who recently made the move from employment. </p> <p>But becoming your own boss can be a key time to apply for a mortgage. Many people decide to move home - often searching for extra space so they can run their business from home. And others want to cash in on the growth in property prices so they can finance their new venture at lower interest rates than a business loan from a bank. </p> <p>One solution is self-certification, where the prospective mortgage customer estimates their own annual earnings instead of relying on an employer or an accountant to come up with the figures. It sounds like a recipe for loan applicants to ask for too much - or to put in fraudulent requests at the other extreme. </p> <p>But that is not quite as easy as it sounds. \"Each application is individually underwritten,\" says Denzil Morgan at Bristol &amp; West which has lent some \u00a3250m since it started self-certification last December. </p> <p>He adds: \"We don't credit-score because it is usually not helpful with self-certification applicants. But we do check on past loans to see if they have shown a good commitment to regular repayments and identify the sources of income. Lifestyle factors are important - we would not lend \u00a3250,000 to someone whose previous home was worth \u00a325,000.\" </p> <p>Bristol &amp; West's typical loan is around \u00a375,000 - roughly in line with the national average. Morgan believes self-certifiers are conservative in their requests. </p> <p>Besides helping homebuyers who cannot produce audited accounts, self-certification also enables borrowers to raise cash on their real earnings rather than sums shown by their accountants. </p> <p>Paul Howard, of Mortgages plc which specialises in loans to those with bad credit records and county court judgments, says there is a dichotomy between accounts which are audited to minimise taxable income and the need of borrowers to raise cash based on what they actually earn. </p> <p>\"Those mainstream lenders which give mortgages to the self-employed and people running their own businesses just look at net profits. They disregard dividends, which are used in tax planning by some small companies, or the way some family concerns pay regular wages to children or others,\" he adds. </p> <p>Bill Dudgeon of The Mortgage Business, a Bank of Scotland offshoot focusing on self-certification, believes that accounts are historic - they do not reflect future cash stream from a growing firm. </p> <p>Lenders also protect themselves by insisting on a sizeable deposit - 15% to 25% is the usual minimum - with the typical borrower putting up 40% of the property's value. A few lenders such as Capital Home Loans, Irish Permanent and Mortgage Express will accept 10% deposits. </p> <p>Moneyfacts shows there are 15 lenders which currently accept self-certification applications. But the only high street names on the list are Bristol &amp; West and Abbey National - and the latter only accepts forms from brokers rather than directly from branches. </p> <p>Self-certification rates tend to be on the higher side - especially on loans which have lower deposits, where standard variable rates can go as high as 8.74%. But many are lower. Abbey National uses the same 7.74% standard variable rate as it does for other borrowers. </p> <p>Brokers who source loans from Mortgage Next can offer mortgages from Britannia subsidiary Verso with discounts of up to 4% for a year, although intermediaries add 0.2% on to the Verso standard 7.78% interest rate. Going direct to Verso gives lower discounts as well as a lower rate and no penalties beyond the cut-rate deal period. </p> <p><strong>Where you can save nearly \u00a3400 a month</strong></p> <p> Interior designer Dawn Bowring was offered little choice when she bought her Somerset farmhouse a decade ago - pay through the nose or go without. </p> <p>She took the first route and ended up forking out between 14% and 17% interest. But now she has remortaged through a self-certification loan, with savings of around \u00a3350 to \u00a3400 a month. </p> <p>Dawn, 33, has always been self-employed. \"I found no bank nor building society at that time who was prepared to lend me anything. They wanted audited accounts which I did not have; and to complicate matters, the house came with an agricultural tie - it could only be sold to a farmer. So I ended up with a loan from a solicitor at a rate that can only be described as extortionate,\" she says. </p> <p>She paid each month on time - unaware of newer style loans that could save a small fortune. </p> <p>\"It's odd that banks know I can handle ludicrous interest rates but are sniffy about lending to me at sensible levels,\" she says. </p> <p>Dawn only discovered better deals when she took a stand at a local agricultural show where a financial services exhibitor told her about self-certification loans from The Mortgage Business. </p> <p>The process took six weeks and TMB is protected by its stake in a property that's worth around \u00a3750,000 including stables, outhouses, 15 acres and a lake. </p> <p>\"I could have produced five years' worth of audited accounts, but they do not reflect my real earnings as I've ploughed lots back into the business,\" she says. </p> <p>Dawn, who lives with her husband and two children, pays TMB's standard 7.65% interest rate.</p>",
  "<p>Like any victim of this humiliating process Mr Blacker would, if he chose to pursue the matter, be entitled to substantial compensation. </p> <p>He walked into the Somerfield store in Diss carrying newspapers that he had just purchased from a nearby newsagent. After paying for the groceries he was buying from the store he was accosted by two uniformed employees who accused him of stealing the newspapers. </p> <p>They claimed to have video evidence to support their accusation and made it clear that they would not allow him to leave the store. When they all looked at the video it turned out to feature someone who was clearly not Mr Blacker. </p> <p>Instead of releasing him after seeing this, the staff continued to detain him. The police were called. A policewoman did then make inquiries at the newsagents and he was released. </p> <p>Only after he wrote about the incident in a national newspaper did Somerfield even send a letter of apology. The company has not, though, offered any compensation. Indeed, the store has suggested that being involved in incidents like this is a price that people should be willing to pay to help support the fight against shoplifting. </p> <p>That, though, is not the view the law takes. Any one making a \"citizen's arrest\", which is what Somerfield did, has to get it absolutely right. Even making a reasonable mistake about someone's guilt does not provide an excuse if a person is wrongly arrested - or falsely imprisoned, as it is legally known. </p> <p>In 1912 the wife of the manager of WH Smiths at Kings Cross, John Walters, was found to be selling newspapers from her own newsstand in Staines that had been taken from that branch of WH Smiths without payment. </p> <p>The company's management arrested Walters at work. At trial the jury accepted he was not guilty of theft as he had intended paying for the newspapers. </p> <p>This meant that no criminal offence had been committed and that the arrest was wrongful. A civil court subsequently awarded him \u00a375 compensation, a sum equivalent to nearly \u00a35,000 in today's values. </p> <p>While that is perhaps more than Blacker would receive if he sued Somerfield, the level of damages in such cases - usually assessed by a civil jury - tend to be generous compared with those awarded to, say, accident victims. </p> <p>In a much worse case than Walters' or Blackers', Steven Smith was last year awarded a total of \u00a331,500 against the West Sussex police. They arrested him without believing he had committed any offence, inflicted very minor injuries in the course of doing so, then held him for nine hours. </p> <p>Despite Mr Smith's case, claims against the police are generally harder to prove, because the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 allows for them, unlike store detectives, to make lawful arrests so long as they have reasonable grounds to suspect an offence. </p> <p>Anyone who finds themselves faced with a false accusation of shoplifting should make it clear that they are not prepared to go anywhere with store staff unless they are formally arrested. There is, of course, no obligation on someone in this situation to prove their innocence. </p> <p>Somerfield's and retailers organisations' spokesmen have suggested that Mr Blacker could have taken steps to avoid the incident, such as opening the newspapers he had bought before walking into the shop. </p> <p>However, there is no obligation to do so. Nor is there any obligation to let store staff inspect one's bags or to produce a receipt. </p> <p>Supermarkets have every right to prevent theft from their stores, but the law requires them to enforce that right only by employing competent, vigilant staff who can distinguish between shoplifters and honest shoppers. </p> <p>The price of getting it wrong is as high for bullying security staff as it is for their victims, something Somerfield will discover if Mr Blacker decides to take the matter further. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "<p>Scottish Widows policyholders may be cock-a-hoop over their bonanza payouts, but policyholders at rival Axa have been left puzzling over highly-complex documents sent out this week detailing windfall payouts from the company's \u00a31.7bn surplus cash. </p> <p>More than 660,000 Axa policyholders received the windfall packs this week, detailing how much they will gain from the distribution of Axa's \"orphan estate\". </p> <p>Axa is handing out the surplus money that has been built up over many years in the with-profits funds of Equity &amp; Law and Sun Life, both of which are now under the control of Axa, a French-based insurer. The cash distribution is the only way that Axa shareholders can gain access to a share of the \u00a31.7bn. </p> <p>The details of the payouts are contained in an immensely complex 110-page policyholder circular, accompanied by a voting form, which has to be returned by October 16. The plan has to be approved by policyholders - it needs a 35% yes vote - with payouts expected to be made in February 2001. </p> <p>The windfalls will come in two parts; firstly a cash payout, which Axa says will be a minimum of \u00a3100 and average \u00a3400, plus a further 'reorganisation bonus' which will be added to the value of policies. It says one lucky policyholder will collect \u00a390,000. </p> <p>Policyholders have a choice: they can either vote in favour and gain the cash and reorganisation bonus, or ignore the mailing, in which case they will not receive the cash bonus but will be eligible for a special bonus at an unspecified time in the future. </p> <p>But policyholders who have contacted Jobs &amp; Money about the windfalls have highlighted how easy it is to be confused about the proposals. Tony and Maureen Webster, who run a guest house in Hemingford Grey, Huntingdon wrote to us this week criticising the proposed payouts as \"disgraceful\" after she was offered just \u00a3221.78 on a pension policy taken out nearly 20 years ago that is currently worth \u00a342,518. </p> <p>However, after several calls between Axa and Jobs &amp; Money, we were able to identify why the payout appeared to be so small. Somewhat confusingly, the \u00a3221.78 payout does not relate to the \u00a342,518 pension policy, but to another, much smaller pension policy that the Websters took out two years later, which has a policy value of around \u00a34,500. </p> <p>The \u00a34,500 policy is a with-profits policy, which qualifies the Websters for the \u00a3221.78 windfall; the \u00a342,518 policy is a unit-linked policy, which will not earn any windfall at all. Unfortunately, this is typical of the gobbledegook common in the life insurance industry. People who have with-profits policies have membership rights in a company - in a sense they \"own\" the company - while unit-linked policyholders do not. </p> <p>Given the complexity of the Axa plan, the Websters' confusion is entirely understandable. \"You've got to have a degree in rocket science to make head or tail of it,\" he says. </p> <p>His opinion is shared by a financial adviser, Chartwell Investment Management. Chief executive Craig Wetton says: \"The literature that Axa policyholders are receiving honourably upholds the reputation that financial services companies deliberately attempt to bamboozle customers. Axa are a French company, and if their literature was written in French it would make very little difference to its comprehension by most of the public.\" </p> <p>Chartwell has produced a guide to the Axa payouts which can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.chartwell-investment.co.uk\">www.chartwell-investment.co.uk</a>, or by writing to Chartwell at 9 Kingsmead Square, Bath BA1 2AB. </p> <p>Axa says disappointment about the size of payouts stems from confusion about what it is attempting to do. Spokesman Stuart Prosser says: \"This is not a demutualisation - it is a completely unique situation. We do seem to be suffering from comparisons with windfalls elsewhere.\" Anyone wanting to check that they have the correct windfall can consult the formula on pages 23-24 of the policyholder circular - but have a calculator handy. </p> <p>Axa has also opened a telephone helpline for policyholders on 0345 341341, open from 8.00am to 6.00pm Monday to Friday. </p> <p>The distribution of Axa's orphan estate is the first of what is expected to be a stream of similar announcements from life companies. Prudential has \u00a38bn in undistributed orphan assets, CGNU \u00a35bn, L&amp;G \u00a32.3bn, Britannic \u00a32bn and Clerical Medical \u00a31.9bn.</p>",
  "<p>Putting all your eggs in one basket is the most dangerous investment course. That may apply to countries as well as companies, particularly when technological development is a must for any populous, advanced country. How safe is the UK in this regard? </p> <p>Hundreds of billions of pounds are being spent by European companies on US acquisition, which is a main reason for the euro's weakness. It demonstrates the concentration of leading edge electronics and computer services companies across the Atlantic. Much the same applies in biotechnology. The US is maintaining pre-eminence in aerospace, though Europe has mounted a fair challenge. In oil and most other extraction industries, and agriculture, the US remains a powerhouse. All this backs up Wall Street's strength and financial leadership. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK has been selling out or cutting back in most established industries and many newer ones. Other European countries have held on to their domestic capacity and self-sufficient possibilities with greater tenacity. They have probably been helped by more stable exchange rates. </p> <p>Now that convergence of growth and financial trends is more apparent than for a very long time, it is easy to assume that prosperity is quite assured among the industrial countries, at least as long as the US leads the way. But some, most notably Japan and Britain, are quite liable to become detached through imbalances in their island economies. </p> <p>As the advance to all-time peaks in their share markets indicates, France and Switzerland are, next to the US, about the two healthiest-looking economies in the world. Although their economic growth rates are around that of the UK, these are accelerating. They have no problem with the gap between imports and exports or an overvalued currency. </p> <p>Comparisons between the performance of the top European and British companies is disturbing. It would be even more worrying but for the rise in foreign ownership of prime UK assets and the apparent permanence of their activities, not least in the booming City of London. Exceptions like Rover tend to prove the rule when family control also persists on the Continent, long after it passed into the hands of managers and limited liability companies in nearly all larger segments of the UK economy. </p> <p>Firms like Nestl\u00e9 of Switzerland and Interbrew of Belgium accentuate the failures of their British counterparts. Cadbury, about the most successful UK branded goods maker, is relatively puny compared with Nestl\u00e9, the world's biggest food group, which bought Rowntree of York for \u00a32bn a decade ago and has many other top brands throughout the world. It also has valuable stakes in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Latest results show a big profit acceleration. </p> <p>The contrast with Allied Domecq and other food and drink producers could hardly be more pronounced. Diageo, the whisky and Guinness group, has been no less amorphous and is also up against faster-growing Continental rivals. </p> <p>Among smaller companies, the emphasis is on high technology and venture capital investments. A number of UK based firms have performed outstandingly well for investors. They are matched by European companies in most high-tech areas and outnumbered in others, including luxury goods and engineering. </p> <p>Over the last three years, the best performing unit trust specialising in Europe, M&amp;G European Smaller Companies, has tripled in value. Over one year it has doubled, in common with Henderson European and the new Scottish Equitable fund in the same category. Henderson unit funds are now being converted into open ended investment companies (OEICs), with a less onerous opening commission of 3% , but an increased annual levy of 2% and a new exit charge diminishing over six years. </p> <p>Investment trusts concentrating on European companies that are growing fastest have done still better in some cases. Fleming European Fledgling, with indirect stakes in unquoted companies, soared by nearly 250% over the last three years, including growth of 140% in the share price over the last year when Invesco Continental and TR European were fairly close behind. </p> <p>Jewellery firms like Bulgari, sports promoters and other consumer services providers are in their lists. With holdings in larger companies, particularly Swiss and French leaders, Gartmore European and Perpetual European achieved around 60% growth over 12 months and 120% over the past three years.</p>",
  "<p>RyanAir's advertising is eye-catching for one thing: the price at which it offers flights. However, obtaining a seat at the advertised prices is near impossible. </p> <p>Earlier this summer offerings included an improbable \u00a331 return to Venice. That fare, as the company likes to point out, is scarcely enough to cover the tax. </p> <p>Closer inspection of the small - in fact virtually microscopic - print at the bottom of the advertisement indicated that the real charge for the flight was \u00a334, after a \u00a33 charge for using a credit card, the only means of payment permitted, is added. </p> <p>Theoretically, that could lead to a prosecution under the misleading price marking regulations, but the triviality of the matter, coupled with the fact RyanAir is based in the Irish Republic, has so far deterred trading standards officers from taking any action. </p> <p>However, \u00a331, or even \u00a334, fares were very difficult to find on the website to which the advert directs you. </p> <p>I inserted eight or nine dates at random and found that fares ranged between \u00a382 and \u00a3122, still reasonable value, but the company's method of advertising had left a slightly bad taste. </p> <p>Of course, the words \"from\" and \"subject to availability\", the stopgaps of companies which see nothing wrong in advertising what they don't usually offer, can also be found in RyanAir's small print. The words are again far from a watertight guarantee against prosecution but no action appears to have been taken. </p> <p>RyanAir's luck with the law continued when Jouko Nyakanen, who had booked a RyanAir flight, from Stanstead to Stockholm in February, sought the advice of the Consumers' Association. </p> <p>His flight had been due to leave at 5.30pm. The screens at the airport told him that it had been delayed. As the screens continued relaying this message, he and several other passengers hung around waiting to be told to board, only to discover, eventually, from the RyanAir desk that the flight had actually taken off without them. </p> <p>Mr Nyakanen wanted compensation from RyanAir, and there wouldn't really seem to be any doubt that he is entitled to it. Even if the airport, rather than the airline, was to blame for the incorrect information being put on the board, RyanAir's staff should have been aware of this and let the passenger know what was going on. Their failure to do so gives Mr Nyakanen a claim of negligence and breach of contract. </p> <p>The Consumers' Assocation advised Mr Nyakanen in its Which? publication that the legal position isn't clear-cut. </p> <p>In a sense that is true. There could be a real dispute between the airline and the airport over the extent to which the airport has to contribute to anything that RyanAir pays Mr Nyakanen, but that doesn't affect the position between him and the airline. </p> <p>When I discussed the matter with the Consumers' Association, a lawyer accepted that the airline appeared to have been negligent, but said that the article was not intended to state the law although it appeared to be attempting to do precisely that. </p> <p>Whether it is worth any passenger suing for the small sum that Mr Nyakanen might hope to recover is doubtful, but consumers should appreciate that when they are let down by an airline, as with any other business, the law is usually on their side. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "<p>It was quite a day for Michael Powell. Not only did he collect his first century of the summer but he was awarded his county cap. More importantly his deeds, and those of Matthew Maynard with whom he shared in a slice of history, ensured that Glamorgan reached the third day of their crucial promotion tussle very much in the ascendancy. </p> <p>Powell burst upon the scene in sensational style as a 20-year-old in 1997 when he scored an unbeaten 200 against Oxford University on his debut. He has never attained such heights since, although he averaged just over 45 last season to top Glamorgan's championship batting.</p> <p>His talent has never been in doubt but he has often struggled to find a rich vein of form. Yesterday was one of his more rewarding days as he defied a succession of bowling changes for nearly six hours.</p> <p>He proved particularly strong off his legs and the Essex attack often seemed slow to recognise the fact. He prospered with ease and confidence against bowlers who fed his strength. </p> <p>Maynard, so experienced and no doubt a calming influence on his young partner, proved an ideal companion during a partnership of 227 which was a Glamorgan record for the fourth wicket against Essex. It beat by 21 runs the one involving Viv Richards and Tony Cottey on the same Southchurch Park ground 10 years ago. </p> <p>With the score on 99 and Maynard only just into double figures he survived a difficult chance to the Essex wicketkeeper James Foster, diving to his right after Danny Law had found the outside edge. </p> <p>Maynard took full advantage of his reprieve to record his second century of the summer, pulling Peter Such for successive fours to complete it. He had earlier employed a pull-cum-sweep to dispatch the off-spinner for six. </p> <p>Having seen Glamorgan beyond 300 to claim a third batting point, the pair departed within two overs of each other, both victims of Such. Powell had made 128 when he pushed forward and presented Paul Prichard with a regulation slip catch, and Maynard, on 102, edged a delivery into his stumps. </p> <p>Essex took the new ball soon afterwards but their only success came when Keith Newell was lbw to Danny Law. Glamorgan registered their fourth batting point just before the close, which arrived with them on 360 for six and holding an advantage of 68. With Adrian Dale still in attendance there is every likelihood of them stretching it into three figures.</p> <p>It was a praiseworthy effort by Glamorgan, particularly as they were without their leading run-gatherer Matthew Elliott, whose season has come to a premature end because of a knee injury.</p>",
  "<p>David Beckham will be asked to compare notes on creative midfield play with Zinedine Zidane in the Stade de France here tomorrow night as Kevin Keegan strives to restore to the England team the inventiveness and imagination so badly lacking in Euro 2000. </p> <p>For a long time now a strong body of opinion has argued that a player with Beckham's passing ability is wasted when his role is limited to supplying crosses from the right. With Darren Anderton now fully fit Keegan will waste no time testing this theory.</p> <p>So Beckham will switch to a central role tomorrow, with Anderton looking certain to return to the right flank. With Keegan expected to employ a five-man midfield in an effort to avoid his team being outpassed by the French, the Pauls Ince and Scholes look like joining Beckham in the centre.</p> <p>Definitely playing, as well as Beckham and Tony Adams, the new England captain following Alan Shearer's retirement from internationals, are Andy Cole and Gareth Barry. Cole will lead the attack either in partnership with Michael Owen or as a lone striker closely supported by Scholes. </p> <p>Barry, whose previous two caps have been as a substitute, will be a left wing-back if Keegan goes for a 3-5-2 system or left-back in a 4-4-2 formation, with Phil Neville on the right. Barry's normal position for Aston Villa is on the left side of a back three but he could not play there for England without disturbing Sol Campbell. </p> <p>If Beckham shows real signs of becoming a serious creative force for England then tomorrow's game against the world and European champions will bring important benefits to Keegan and his squad for the opening 2002 World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland early next month. </p> <p>Certainly the 25-year-old Manchester United player, wearing a diamond stud in each ear and sporting the wristwatch equivalent of Big Ben, appears to relish a further opportunity to vindicate those who would like to see him given a run in this position.</p> <p>\"I hope I can show that I'm a better player in this role than I am on the right,\" he said last night. \"Maybe one game is not enough. Certainly I would like to have a few more matches to get used to playing in this position.\" </p> <p>Beckham also endorsed Keegan's stewardship. \"He's the best England manager I've played under... but then I've only played under two,\" he added. \"He's a great motivator. He makes us want to go out and do well both for him and the country. He is a great man manager.\" </p> <p>In spite of Beckham's confidence it has to be said that previously his reluctance to go past opponents from central midfield, preferring to play long passes to the flanks or the front-runners, has raised doubts about his ability truly to run a game in the manner of a Zidane, a Roberto Baggio or even a Paul Gascoigne. </p> <p>Cole, who missed Euro 2000 in order to have an operation on a trapped nerve in a foot, felt that Shearer's retirement would help Keegan try something different up front but was not assuming that he would keep the central striker's position long-term. \"I'm 29 and I don't know how long I've got to go,\" he said, \"and there are so many good young strikers coming through who will need to be given a chance.\" </p> <p>Barry confessed that he would probably have never been in Keegan's European Championship squad had he not been naturally left-footed. Yet the Villa 19-year-old has an ability to control and distribute the ball in a calm and collected manner beyond his years. And nothing will help England tomorrow night if they do not pass the ball properly and move off it with more enthusiasm than they did earlier this summer. </p> <p> <strong> England </strong> (possible, 3-5-2): <strong> Seaman</strong> ;<strong> Keown</strong> ,<strong> Adams</strong> (all Arsenal), <strong> Campbell</strong> ; <strong> Anderton</strong> (both Tottenham), <strong> Beckham</strong> (Man Utd), <strong> Ince </strong> (Middlesbrough), <strong> Scholes </strong> (Man Utd), <strong> Barry </strong> (Aston Villa); <strong> Cole </strong> (Man Utd), <strong> Owen </strong> (Liverpool).</p>",
  "<p>Only 38 overs were possible today amid the Oval showers, but England still got themselves into a real tangle, losing their last five wickets for 60 to complete a collapse of ten for 122 on the truest strip of the summer. </p> <p>This represented one step back after the two they had taken forward at Headingley, where England also began the second day five down. On that occasion they took control with some of the most positive batting of the series, turning ones into twos, twos into threes and the West Indian fielders into schoolboys. Here they seemed burdened by the weight of history (\"31 years of hurt\" has become a cliche almost overnight) and Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe were as strokeless as they can ever have been. </p> <p>Everyone agreed that England had to get through the first hour against the second new ball unscathed. It's just that they forgot how to score runs in the process - so much so that by the time Hick was trapped in front by Ambrose, just 33 runs had come in 20 boundaryless overs. In fact, it took until 3.40pm - when Andy Caddick square-cut Courtney Walsh - for anyone to reach the boundary at all. England weren't just letting the Windies bowl at them; they were letting them back in the series.</p> <p>If Hick was brilliantly worked over by Ambrose, who still loves bowling to him as much as he did in Hick's disastrous debut series nine years ago, then Thorpe was brilliantly thought out by Walsh - again (expect several Oscar Wilde allusions in the press tomorrow). He was so embarrassed by his second failure to deal with the slower ball that he was on his way to the pavilion before Aussie umpire Daryl Harper had raised his finger (\"Strewth, mate! Walking for an lbw?\"). Meanwhile Wasim and Waqar will surely be honing their slower one before England arrive in Pakistan in October.</p> <p>The rest of the batting was a throwback to the days - admittedly not all that long ago - when the tail folded almost as easily as a 50-rand note in Hansie Cronje's back pocket. Dominic Cork, a double-centurion last week, was frenetic even when making 0, Caddick tried to pull Walsh, and it took a chirpy 17-run last-wicket stand between Darren Gough and Craig White to lift England to 281. </p> <p>West Indies bowled well. Nixon McLean, with a mixture of accuracy and hostility that has proved beyond Franklyn Rose and Reon King, confirmed that he may be the best-placed of the second-string seamers to assume the mantle of Curtly and Courtney. Curtly and Courtney again confirmed that, if and when they retire, they'll go out at the top.</p> <p>But with rain forecast for tomorrow, 281 could yet prove a useful total on a wicket that has enough in it to keep the seamers happy. And there was some help for Caddick and Gough when they ran in this evening. They will have to bowl well to keep Brian Lara quiet, though. A quick hundred from him and there could be some nerve-wracking sessions ahead.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",
  "A runway inspection delay at the Charles de Gaulle airport used by the doomed Air France Concorde meant it had not been checked for more than 12 hours, it emerged today. <p>The preliminary report into the crash on July 25 that killed all 109 on board the supersonic plane and four on the ground, showed that the inspection had been delayed for a fire practice.</p> <p>Three inspections are usually carried out at the Paris airport at flexible times, compared to at least five a day at London's Heathrow, it emerged.</p> <p>On the fatal day, the first inspection was carried out at 4:30am (3.30am BST), according to the report. A partial inspection was made at 2:30pm because a plane was believed to have collided with a bird.</p> <p>But a second full inspection at 3pm was postponed because of the fire practice between 2:35 and 3:10pm). </p> <p>This showed the runway was not fully inspected for more than 12 hours before the Concorde took off, at 4:42pm.</p> <p>A British Airports Authority (BAA) spokeswoman said: \"We carry out about five inspections under normal circumstances, but if there are adverse weather conditions we would do more. \"All the inspections are the same and take around 45 minutes to complete and are done throughout the day, but not at any set time.</p> <p>\"A 12-hour delay between inspections would not happen at Heathrow.\"</p> <p>No conclusions were drawn from the preliminary crash report, published on the internet, but the inspection delay did not necessarily have a bearing on the presence of a metal strip that gashed the plane's tyres.</p> <p>An airport official said nothing untoward had been reported on the runway, either by pilots using it or by cleaners and the firemen in the hours leading up to the crash.</p> <p>\"If anything wrong would have existed, it would have been noticed immediately,\" airport authority spokesman Didier Hamon said at a Paris news conference.</p> <p>\"We do believe that everything was done that day as it is normal to do,\" he added. \"On that day, nothing abnormal, nothing exceptional was reported to the airport authority.\"</p> <p>It could be at least a year before the final report is published by the BEA - France's Accident and Inquiry Office.</p> <p>A judicial investigation is also in progres. This comes a day after the BEA released its preliminary report on the accident which gave a blow-by-blow account of the final moments of Air France Flight 4590 that, in less than two minutes, took off then plunged in flames into a small hotel north of Paris.</p> <p>The highly technical 75 page report detailed debris including a more than 8.8 lb tyre part with a near 13 inch gash, the bent metal strip that destroyed the tyre and the crash site.</p> <p>The report stresses that it was the destruction of a forward tyre on the left landing gear - gashed by the stray piece of metal - that likely triggered a chain of events dooming the flight. Investigators have said the part did not appear to belong to the doomed plane but no airline whose planes used Charles de Gaulle airport's runway 26 that day has reported any missing parts on its aircraft, it was announced.</p> <p>There was no hint in the report or by officials that the part might have come from something other than an aircraft.</p> <p>A transcript of the crew's gallant attempts to save the burning Air France Concorde was also published in the report.</p> <p>Less than two minutes elapsed from the control tower warning the crew that flames were showing and the last words from the plane. The final words from Captain Christian Marty, as the crew tried to land at nearby Le Bourget airport, were: \"Too late ... no time.\" Moments later, the New York-bound plane went down in flames.</p> <p>The report showed that just after the plane took off, the crew received the chilling message from the Paris control tower: \"Concorde zero ... 4590, You have flames. You have flames behind you.\" </p> <p>As the crew desperately tried to steer the plane towards Le Bourget, the last words heard on the tape, from the co-pilot, were: \"Negative, we're trying Le Bourget.\"</p>",
  "<p>Movies and glamour go together like tea and toast - or, rather, like champagne and canapes. Hollywood stars, from Greta Garbo to Gwyneth Paltrow, have been lauded as icons not just of beauty, but of style. But now, film as a directional influence on fashion is at a low ebb. </p> <p>In the 30s, the American department store Macy's did a roaring trade in dresses that were copies of gowns worn by Joan Crawford in her films; this year, the high street cleaned up with copies of Jennifer Lopez's Versace dress, worn not on screen, but to the Golden Globes. Think of Audrey Hepburn - the image that most likely comes to mind has her with piled-up hair, sunglasses and pearls in Breakfast at Tiffany's; now, it is the real-life Lopez and Paltrow that girls emulate, not their fictional characters. </p> <p>Most mainstream Hollywood films are styled in such an impeccably slick, unarguably up-to-date way that they end up directly mirroring designer fashion, rather than operating at a tangent to it. </p> <p>It was not always so. The films that have made most impact on our style sensibili ties feature clothes which are an extension of the characters, rather than a catwalk rerun. Think of Diane Keaton in mannish shirt, tie and trousers in Annie Hall; Madonna loaded with eyeliner and trashy black lace in Desperately Seeking Susan. </p> <p>The recently re-released A Bout de Souffle (Breathless) is still remembered not just as the film that launched the career of Jean-Luc Godard, but as the film that launched the gamine crop and simple chic aesthetic of Jean Seberg's character, Patricia. The film may be 40 years old, but it has more to offer those in search of wardrobe inspiration than the rest of the summer's releases put together. </p> <p>No one has ever looked as classy in what is essentially a promotional T-shirt as Patricia does sauntering along the Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Herald Tribune cap-sleeved top, capri pants and ballet flats. There is a quirkiness to Patricia's wardrobe that perfectly echoes the mercurial nature of her character: one minute she is boyish in a man's shirt, the next the essence of understated European chic in a simple sweater, later as coquettish as a pre-teen birthday girl in a full-skirted, black-and-white striped dress. </p> <p>Seberg's daisy-fresh, innocent-abroad looks are perfectly offset by Jean-Paul Belmondo, who, as Michel, a thief on the run, oozes the laconic sex appeal of a young Humphrey Bogart (on whom Michel models himself). Hounded by the police and the media, Michel is, quite literally, the poster-boy of the romantic criminal: rumpled and dark-shadowed but still well-turned-out, sporting a dapper houndstooth check tie, a rakish fedora hat. This is a film where image matters. Michel's final, desperate attempt to flee the law is interrupted when a fellow criminal stops him to say that his choice of silk socks with woollen trousers is an absolute no-no. And that's the moment when we know it's all over.</p>",
  "The saga of Scotland's discredited examination authority descended into farce yesterday when it emerged that customary computer checks on exam results had not been carried out. <p>An undisclosed number of pupils have been told they have failed new-style higher grade exams when they should have passed, while others have received lower grades than they should have. </p> <p>Although the Scottish Qualifications Authority has consistently claimed there was no lowering of quality control in this year's procedures, it yesterday belatedly conceded that computer checks had not been done on the results in the new highers, as they would have been done in past years. </p> <p>The Headteachers' Association Scotland has said that the discrepancies in grades predicted by schools and what pupils obtained was two to three times what would otherwise be expected. In some schools it was up to 10 times greater. </p> <p>The Scottish executive said yesterday that a lack of computer checks might account for some of these anomalies. </p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, education spokeswoman for the Scottish National party, commented that the authority had now lost all credibility. </p> <p>\"We are not talking about a few thousand results being wrong. We are now talking about potentially every new higher result having doubt cast upon it,\" she said. </p> <p>In past years, the authority used a computer programme to check quality control - the \"derived grades procedure\", which took into account a school's prediction as to its student's exam grade to raise a mark if he or she came close to a cut-off point between grades; it could therefore result in a pupil jumping up a grade, and sometimes applying the procedure could mean the difference between someone having a pass or a fail. </p> <p>The authority yesterday admitted that the programme had not been used this year because school predictions were not available. </p> <p>It promised, however, that any anomalies would be sorted out by its appeals procedure, and said that the programme would be reinstated for next year's exams. </p> <p>A deadline for submitting appeals has been set for this weekend. </p> <p>However, the corrected results following an appeal are not expected to be announced for a number of weeks - thus leaving students who have been mistakenly told they have failed to meet the standard required for their chosen university to possibly find out that they have in fact done sufficiently well to merit entry, just as they are about to start an alternative, fall-back course. </p> <p>David Caldwell, director of Coshep, the Scottish university principals' organisation, said yesterday that the universities would endeavour to make sure that all students whose successful appeals meant that their results met the requirements of their offer through Ucas, the universities' clearing house, would get on to their chosen university course. </p> <p>\"The timing is awkward, as the results of the appeals will be coming through at the same time as the academic year begins, but we will do our best to make sure no one is disadvantaged.\" </p> <p>Brian Monteith, the Conservative education spokesman, said that the authority could no longer be taken at its word, as it had previously repeatedly asserted that its quality control was the same as in previous years. </p> <p>The continuing crisis is putting increasing pressure on the Scottish education minister, Sam Galbraith, for him to resign. He does not accept he has the ultimate responsibility for the authority's failings, but he may not be able to ride out the storm much longer. </p> <p>When the Scottish parliament reconvenes next week, he will be called before its education committee, where he will face fierce questioning as both the Conservatives and the SNP attempt to secure his ministerial scalp. </p> <p>If Mr Galbraith does not perform sufficiently well in front of the committee, he may be forced to go then. </p> <p> <b>From bad to worse</b><br></p> <p> <b> March</b> Ministers learn there are problems, but are assured they will be sorted out by the qualifications authority. </p> <p><b> August 10</b> Results sent out. Thousands of pupils receive incomplete or inaccurate certificates; thousands more receive none at all; and many certificates make no sense. </p> <p><b> August 11</b> Principals of Scottish universities say they have no confidence in the authority. </p> <p><b> August 12</b> Authority chief executive Ron Tuck resigns. </p> <p><b> August 17</b> A level results published outside Scotland, while 5,000 Scottish students continue to await accurate results. </p> <p><b> August 21</b> Scottish executive confirms 700 students will be late in entering clearing. </p> <p><b> August 23</b> Ucas says number of Scottish pupils taking up university places has fallen 6.6%. </p> <p><b> August 29</b> Authority admits 4,000 standard grade pupils given incorrect results. </p> <p><b> August 30</b> Authority admits faxing wrong standard grade results to schools.

  "<p><strong>KOOG GETS SERIOUS</strong></p> <p>First the good news: England's side to face France tomorrow does not include Phil Neville. Or his brother. Or any member of the Neville family. And if that wasn't strange enough, Kelvin Koogan's big Parisian adventure hasn't - so far - seen him wildly beating his red and white drum and loudly proclaiming: \"people might think I'm crazy but we've got a great chance of winning 3-0!\" Instead he's testing out a new 4-4-1-1 formation, playing Gareth Barry and giving David Beckham another chance to prove he deserves to play in the centre. Which all sounds strangely sensible.</p> <p>Of course, Koog being Koog there was the usual boyish enthusiasm, despite half the press pack wearing black (and it wasn't because black is the new black on the Paris catwalks either). He praised Villa defender Barry calling his performance in training \"fantastic\", and telling reporters he would take tomorrow's game \"in his stride\". \"He's a great user of the ball and doesn't get flustered and I think that is a major, major plus at international level,\" Koog continued, looking at neither Neville brother in particular. </p> <p>And there was also a coherent enough explanation for his contentious decision drop the red-hot Michael Owen in favour of a Scholes-Cole axis as well. \"His form has been very good but I wanted to try playing one-up and one-off,\" said Koog. \"Andy Cole has become very adaptable, we did play like that at Newcastle and the Beardsley-Cole partnership was tremendously difficult to play against.\" And seeing as Koog didn't mention that he broke up that \"tremendously difficult to play against\" partnership by selling Cole, then neither will we.</p> <p>England team: Seaman; Barry, Adams (captain), Keown, Campbell; Barmby, Wise, Beckham, Anderton; Scholes; Cole.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>DIDI DO WELL?</strong></p> <p>Who says that Rangers are streets ahead in Scotland? Not the Fiver for sure (and that's in a Dutch accent).

And so it has proven today, when the jumpy Irishman announced the signing of some French bloke and Alan Thompson, occasional Aston Villa substitute.</p> <p>\"I have not bought these players now because of any European deadlines\", said O'Neill, which was a relief. \"That is no way to run a club - and in any case our over-riding priority this season is the league championship. That is why Alan and Didier are here.\" A glance at our \"Frenchmen in Scottish football\" flick book informed us that \"Didier\" is in fact Didier Agathe, a 25 year-old striker who has scored four goals in five league games since joining Hibernian in the summer. Why that deserves a \u00a350,000 transfer to Celtic is anyone's guess (although it's more reason than any player will need come next season).</p> <p>Even more mysterious is the \u00a32.5m signing of the so-unpredictable-you'd-think- he-was-an-episode-of-Brookside Alan Thompson. \"Alan is well known to me and I've seen him play a lot of times,\" said O'Neill. \"It hasn't been the best of years for him but he is a talented player - a very talented player - and this move will really get his confidence going again.\" Presumably Mad Mart knows more than we do, and we look forward to seeing Thompson knocking on the door of the England team.

  "<p>Film and fashion have been flirting since before Charlie Chaplin first put a hat on, but this week the love affair reached a new high - one with a distinctly dodgy twist. First, Martin Scorsese revealed that, having tackled boxing, gambling and organised crime, his next project would deal with the most crooked business of them all - fashion - in a film about the Gucci family feud. And Guy Ritchie's latest film, Snatch, which hits cinema screens today, is sure to extend the mockney-mobster aesthetic pioneered by its predecessor, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This fashionable new look is seeping, with ever greater concentration, into the style sensibility of the average twentysomething British male. Not since James Dean slouched in Rebel Without a Cause has on-screen style made such an impact on our wardrobes. </p> <p>Gangster chic is arguably cinema's greatest contribution to men's fashion, and after decades of New York tough guys, Ritchie - himself seldom seen without his Alfred Dunhill cashmere coat - has shown that British men can wear it, too. And they love him for it. The current issue of the totemic lad mag Loaded, for example, describes Snatch as \"the crowning and probably final moment of gangster fashion\". Meanwhile, FHM devotes a dozen pages to the film's key characters in its fashion section. Inside you can read how the Savile Row tailor and unflagging self-publicist Ozwald Boateng provided bespoke costumes for Lock Stock's original cast of \"authentic\" tough guys. </p> <p>If that's not enough evidence of the film's fashionable influence, go out tonight and observe twentysomething males queuing up to be first to take in Ritchie's latest and note how the British gangster movie's essential accessories - shiny loafers, pressed shirts, glinting boxes of 20 B&amp;H - are influencing our nation's smart-casual sensibility. </p> <p>Never mind the fact that real east-end petty criminals prefer to go to work in grubby Air Maxes and lurid Puffa jackets; faux cockney-criminal chic lets you look: a) sharp, b) a little bit tasty, and c) like a proper geezer - and who can complain about that? </p> <p>In retrospect, this state of affairs is the logical conclusion of a succession of gangster looks that film-makers have brought us over the past decade. It began with the hugely influential Reservoir Dogs and the slimline white-shirt, black-tie outfits worn by its protagonists. The get-up offered a knowing nod to the seedy glamour of Sinatra's Rat Pack and showed a generation of formalwear-phobic young men that suits wouldn't necessarily make them look like accountants - or, worse, schoolboys. </p> <p>A raft of cheapo sub-Tarantino crime flicks experimented with variations on the same sartorial theme, while several British-made gangster films, before and after Lock, Stock, tried to give the suit a comparably iconic presence. For the average movie-going geezer, though, Brit gangster fashion was always a little bit outre and risque, and had too many echoes of mod and 60s flamboyance to make the leap from screen to high-street store; you could happily admire it and buy the poster, but you wouldn't want to emulate it through your wardrobe. What Ritchie has done is domesticate the gangster look, make it safe for the fashion-fearing modern man who thinks being seen in pinstripes is as emasculating as arriving at the pub with a pink poodle. </p> <p>Effecting this shift has been something of a triumph - which is precisely why it is so depressing. \"I reckon if you get too interested in clothes, it all starts getting a bit fruity.\" That's the enlightened line Ritchie takes in September's FHM. You might have thought that his settling down with the most audacious, fashion-friendly pop star of the last 20 years would have broadened his style horizons, but you'd be wrong. \"Frankly,\" he continues, Madonna \"would have me dressed up like a poof if she could\". The godfather of Brit gangster chic sounds like an uptight estate agent after a few too many at the cricket club - a million miles from the iconic movie gangsters of the past. </p> <p>In Scorsese's Casino, Robert De Niro may have been hard as nails, but that didn't stop him wearing Dame Edna sunglasses and primary-coloured pimp suits. Even the macho supermen of 70s blaxploitation flicks such as Black Caesar found the time to invest in some decidedly \"fruity\" ruffled shirts and velvet jackets. Movie gangsters of old strutted like peacocks and preened themselves like poodles; they pushed the fashion envelope just as they tested the farthest limits of the law. They had a fatalistic, forbidden glamour. These days, we have to make do with geezerdom instead. </p> <p>Thankfully, there is a glimmer of hope for those of us bored silly by the nightclub bouncer-meets-monied-football hooligan look of gangster chic and, more importantly, its trickle-down effect on British menswear in general. The cultural swing back to modern tailoring - something often touted in recent times - is finally gathering some real momentum. Richard James and Gieves &amp; Hawkes, both purveyors of finely crafted, grown-up menswear, have just opened flagship, central-London stores and won acres of approving magazine coverage by doing so. Burberry, too, is enjoying a new wave of interest in its classic cuts. And a cover story in the latest issue of money magazine Forbes Global heralds the renaissance of \"dressing down in style\", arguing that the demise of the suit as a workplace uniform, combined with a growing awareness among men of the potential for elegance and individuality offered by a properly made two-piece signals a shift in style choices in the west. If that trend expands, it means a new dawn in fashion for men who go to a tailor with confidence, rather than those who need to buy their self-assurance and masculine credentials off the shelf. It's about time. </p> <p>In 1986, Madonna recorded a song called White Heat, a tribute to James Cagney in the 1949 gangster classic of the same name. The chances of her recording a comparable tribute to the verve and panache of her husband's leading men - say, Vinnie \"You're the Bollocks, Innit\" Jones - look decidedly slim. And on that note, what's the likelihood of Brit gangster chic going down in the histories of timeless screen style? As Al Pacino said in Donnie Brasco - slumped on the flock sofa in a hideous tracksuit, but still knocking the style spots off the Snatch mob - fugedaboutit.</p>",
  "<b>What's the prime minister said?</b> <br> In a speech to police officers in Kent, Tony Blair promised to provide an extra \u00a3109m in order to take DNA samples from everyone arrested in Britain. He claimed that the move would help the fight against crime by ensuring that samples \"from virtually the entire criminally active population\" are stored on a national database. <p><b>Why do the police want the samples? </b><br>Because DNA provides a genetic code which is almost unique to each human being. As with a fingerprint, this code can link an individual to the scene of a crime - and while criminals find it easy to avoid leaving fingerprints it is far harder to ensure nothing is left which might be tested for DNA. In particular, material which can be tested for DNA is often available in the cases of violent crimes such as rape and murder. Now police officers will be able to match the samples against a massive database. </p> <p><b>Why has the PM announced the new funds now? </b><br>Because he is attempting to combat a widespread public perception that Labour is failing on the issue of law and order. Polls show that the Conservative party has pulled ahead on the issue. In response, ministers have been this week making a series of announcements on crime - including a bid by Jack Straw, the home secretary, to recruit more officers. Mr Blair's speech is part of this campaign.</p> <p><b>And does his announcement mean anything in practice? </b><br>Yes - though it's not quite as significant as the PM claims. The police already have the power to take DNA samples from people they arrest and the national database is also in place. The prime minister's speech does not mean that the law will be changed. But until now, the high cost of DNA testing - \u00a340 per test - has prevented its widespread use. It's only been used for serious crimes such as murder and as a result the national database contains only 940,000 samples. Now everyone who is arrested will be tested and the result will be a database of almost 4m samples by 2004.</p> <p><b>Sounds like Big Brother. Is anyone worried by this? </b><br>Civil liberties campaigners are very concerned about misuse of the samples. They claim that the forensic science laboratory already contains 50,000 DNA samples which are held unlawfully. The police are required to destroy samples from everyone who is arrested but not convicted. Activists will be watching carefully to make sure this happens. But the prime minister insists that \"the civil liberties argument is completely misplaced\".</p> <p><b>What happens abroad? </b><br>In the United States, campaigners against capital punishment are using DNA testing to prove that some people on death row are innocent. Because DNA evidence is so conclusive, this has had an impact on the way Americans see the death penalty. Several US states are also setting up DNA databases similar to those in Britain.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/crssummary.htm\" target=\"_new\">The government's crime reduction strategy</a><br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">The Home Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">10 Downing Street</a></p>",

He is presently hosting a suppliers' conference at the venue. </p> <p>GUS declined to comment. </p> <p>A high-profile advertising campaign has turned the computer and home entertainment retailer into one of the most visible e-commerce brands in Britain. </p> <p>However, many observers will be surprised by how much the company's valuation has fallen since the start of the year. </p> <p>In February, analysts were tentatively valuing the company as highly as \u00a3700m after investment bank UBS Warburg was appointed to examine a possible flotation. </p> <p>However, the sell-off in high technology stocks forced Warburgs to dramatically scale back the figure and by June, Mr Bennett said, the bank was targeting a flotation value of around \u00a3180m. </p> <p>A further depression in the value of e-commerce companies has forced Jungle's adviser to reduce the valuation to just \u00a336m, including \u00a310m in debt. </p> <p>Mr Bennett says the company is expected to turnover around \u00a3100m this year. </p> <p>It is understood that GUS plans to integrate Jungle into its Argos retail group, which it bought two years ago, and use it principally to sell computers and software. The division is run by Terry Duddy, a former chief executive of Dixons' PC World. </p> <p>The Argos catalogue goes into 17m homes in Britain and Mr Duddy is thought to believe that he can build a serious rival to Dixons - which dominates PC sales in Britain - by leveraging the strength of that database online. </p> <p>GUS has around 15 websites based on brands including Experian, Argos, Kays and Innovations. Tellingly, the company does not have a presence in the PC market. </p> <p>Mr Bennett has previously said that if a flotation was not a possibility he would consider a link-up with a traditional bricks and mortar retailer. </p> <p>Jungle was set up in the middle of last year with the \u00a310m backing of venture capital group 3i. It holds a 25% stake. Mr Bennett had previously built up the Software Warehouse retail group with fund ing from 3i. The stores were sold to a management buyout team in May but Jungle took over its PC mail order business. </p> <p>Jungle.com has spent in excess of \u00a35m on television, radio and press advertising. </p> <p>The company's corporate theme is The Lion Sleeps Tonight, a hit in the 1980s for Tight Fit. </p> <p>Mr Bennett recently persuaded the band's lead singer to give up his job as an entertainer at a Butlin's holiday camp in Devon to help promote Jungle. In his spare time Mr Bennett is building an internet portal called GlobalShed.com, which will specialise in do-it-yourself activities, with the assistance of television's Big Breakfast presenter Johnny Vaughan.</p>",
  "1.

A 1927 proposal to site a large power station on the south bank of the Thames <a href=\"http://www.batterseapowerstation.com/hist1.html#openanchor\" target=\"_new\"> sparked controversy</a>, with questions raised in parliament about the harm caused by possible pollution from Battersea to paintings in the nearby <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Tate gallery</a> on Millbank.</p> <p>6. Ironically, Battersea power station was the first choice of venue for the new <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">Tate Modern</a>. But financial considerations meant that the honour went to the smaller <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/building/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">Bankside power station</a>, east up the Thames at Southwark.</p> <p>7. Both Bankside and Battersea power stations were designed by architect <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/8/0,5716,107048+1+104811,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Sir Giles Gilbert Scott</a>.

Battersea power station, with its four distinctive towers (added in 1953), Art Deco control room, Italian marble turbine hall, polished parquet floors and wrought iron staircases, is the largest brick building in Europe. It quickly won many <a href=\"http://www.batterseapowerstation.com/index.html\" target=\"_new\">admirers</a> and was granted <a href=\"http://www.batterseapowerstation.com/hist2.html#heritage building \" target=\"_new\">grade II listed status</a> in 1980.</p> <p>9. The station was the third largest in Britain, providing London with up to 509 megawatts of electricity for 50 years until its closure in 1983. It was bought from the Central Electricity Generating Board for \u00a31.5m by developer <a href=\"http://www.batterseapowerstation.com/hist3.html#Roche\" target=\"_new\">John Broome</a>, who planned to build an Alton Towers-style complex on the site. The roof was removed in 1988 for development, but costs spiralled after structural problems were discovered. Five years later the site was sold to Parkview. </p> <p>10. Parkview plans to rebuild the roof and west wall in glass and convert the interior to nine separate levels. Four towers below the landmark chimneys will contain lifts and escape stairs, while one of the 370ft chimneys will house a \"thrill ride\". There will also be two hotels, a theatre, cinema, flats, rooftop restaurants and a dedicated rail link from Victoria station. <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">English Heritage</a> has described the plan as \"the first scheme of real quality proposed for the power station\".</p>",
  "The final terrifying moments of Air France flight 4590 were revealed yesterday as French accident investigators released their preliminary report on July's Concorde crash outside Paris that killed 113 people. <p>In a chilling transcript, the cockpit voice recorder graphically describes the final 77 seconds as the pilot, Christian Marty, struggles for control of the airliner, by now shooting flames from its left wing. </p> <p>At 2.43pm, shortly after take-off, the control tower warned: \"Concorde zero... 4590, you have flames. You have flames behind you.\" </p> <p>The crew, unable to retract the undercarriage and losing power fast, tried desperately to reach nearby Le Bourget airport. Seven seconds after the first message from air traffic control, the chief navigator confirmed: \"Breakdown engine two.\" Then, four seconds later: \"Cut engine two.\" </p> <p>As the aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing, Mr Marty, in his last words, was heard to say: \"Too late... No time.\" Just after 2.44pm, the co-pilot exclaimed: \"Le Bourget, Le Bourget. Negative; we are trying Le Bourget.\" Sixteen seconds later, the recording ends. The plane ploughed into a hotel in the small town of Gonesse. </p> <p>The crash prompted Air France to ground its remaining Concordes immediately; British Airways followed suit three weeks later. </p> <p>The investigators from the French accident inquiry board, BEA, confirmed their earlier hypothesis that a burst tyre had set off the fatal chain of events that downed the New York-bound plane, killing all those on board - mainly German passengers and nine crew - and four people on the ground. </p> <p>\"The July 25 accident shows that the destruction of a tyre, an event that we cannot say will not recur, had catastrophic consequences... preventing the crew from rectifying the situation,\" the report said. \"The crew had no way of knowing about the nature of the fire, nor any means of fighting it.\" </p> <p>It confirmed that a metal strip, probably from another plane, had been found on the runway. \"It has holes in it and in some of these holes appear to be Cherry aeronautical rivets. This strip has not been identified as coming from Concorde,\" the report said. </p> <p>The BEA said last month that the 16-inch piece of metal had \"almost certainly\" gashed the Concorde's tyre, sending large chunks of rubber hurtling at tremendous speed into the plane's fuel tanks, contained in its delta-shaped wings, and sparking the blaze. </p> <p>\"At least one fuel tank was ruptured in one or more places, resulting in a substantial fuel leak. The leaking fuel caught light and a very violent fire ensued throughout the duration of the flight. Engine problems occurred in engine number two and, briefly, in engine number one,\" yesterday's interim report, released on the internet, said. </p> <p>Over the 25 years Concorde has been in commercial operation, there have been at least seven incidents in which one or more of the plane's tyres have burst, leading to punctures in the wings or fuel tanks. </p> <p>But in all of those incidents it was a piece of flying metal - from the undercarriage or water deflectors - that caused the damage, not tyre rubber itself. Safety efforts were therefore concentrated on strengthening all metal parts that could be broken off in a tyre burst, but not on protecting the wings.</p>",
  "<p>There are things I remember about childhood Sunday visits to my paternal grandma that I can still only see from the waist-high perspective of a six-year-old. The bottle of Robinson's lemon barley water in the cupboard under the drawer with the old tennis balls I played with on the drive. A copy of the Beano that tradition dictated would be \"hidden\" under the middle cushion of the coffee-coloured sofa. And the Pyrex jug, opaque with age and scratches, holding creamy Yorkshire pudding batter, standing beside the sprouts (already cooked half to death) on top of the stove. </p> <p>Grandma was the queen of Yorkshire pudding-making and understandably proud. By contrast, my mother's tasted good but they always turned upside-down in their tins so they ended up looking like dumplings and there was no hole into which to pour your gravy. </p> <p>In retrospect, I can see that this pleased grandma immeasurably: the secret of the successful Yorkshire pudding was passed down from generation to generation, mother to daughter, and so my grandmother was able to assume a proprietorial superiority over her daughter-in-law. Just as well, then, that she is no longer around. She would be appalled - and no doubt wickedly delighted - at my utter ineptitude when faced with the task of producing anything approaching an edible Yorkshire pudding. </p> <p>I tried to make Yorkshire pudding last weekend and it was a disaster. One hundred phone calls home and fevered consultations with every recipe book on the kitchen shelf could not help me mix the batter to the consistency I recollected from grandma's kitchen. But I did get some things right. The roast beef was resting gracefully on top of the oven and the fat smoking in the tins when I poured in the mixture. Not enough of the mixture, as it turned out. I squatted on the floor and peered excitedly through the oven door, the better to observe the small miracle of the rising of the batter. Slowly, it coloured around the edges to a pale gold. Then, as I watched expectantly, each would-be pudding frazzled within seconds to a brittle, blackened disc. And that was that. </p> <p>Which got me thinking that, in this ready-cooked age, there might be a danger of the ability to make such an irreplaceable and delicious part of our culinary heritage as Yorkshire pudding dying out. When my mother was my age - 26 - she had a one-year-old daughter and had been cooking a weekly family roast with all its accoutrements for the past four years. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, have spent the past four years getting out of bed late at the weekend and rustling up bacon sarnies. In any given six months I eat more restaurant dinners than my parents have enjoyed in their entire lives. I practically have a degree in ordering from Indian takeaways. Of course, I cook too, but it tends to be \"assemblage\" food, hastily thrown together when I arrive home at 8.30pm after a depleting slog across London on the Tube. Pan-fried salmon steaks; caesar salad fresh from its cellophane bag; spaghetti alla puttanesca; carpaccio of beef and warm potato salad; marinated chicken kebabs ... this is what my generation mean by cooking. No one, repeat no one, of my age and acquaintance has ever even tried to make a Yorkshire pudding. </p> <p>I first began to fear for the future of the Yorkshire pudding when I ordered it at the Mirabelle, Marco Pierre White's elegant London restaurant. Marco Pierre White's fiery brusqueness and his Yorkshire pedigree are well-documented. So it seems fair to suppose that he, of all people, would not struggle to make a fine pudding. For, as Jennifer Stead writes in her essay Yorkshire Pudding and Parkin: \"The fact that they require spanking-hot fat, explosions as the batter hits it, fierce heat, and crisp results, may explain why it has often been said that only Yorkshire folk - those possessing the Yorkshire temperament - can make a true Yorkshire pudding.\" </p> <p>Alas, the Mirabelle's Yorkshire pudding was a grave disappointment. Its first sin was to come on the plate alongside the meat and vegetables. Sacrilege! The whole point of Yorkshire pudding when it was originally made in the 18th century was that it was a cheap way of taking the edge off hearty appetites before they fell to devouring the meat. It also tastes better that way. </p> <p>Jesiah Oakroyd, in JB Priestley's The Good Companions, puts it best: \"A Yorkshire pudding is eaten by itsen and not mixed up wi' meat and potaters, all in a mush.\" Even worse, the Mirabelle's Yorkshire pudding was yellowy and rich-tasting, as if extra eggs and extra milk had been used. Someone in the kitchen seemed to be trying to spruce up a centuries-old pauper's recipe to make it more appealing to toffs. And it was as pale and soft as they are. What folly! As Jesiah explains: \"If you've mixed right and your oven's hot, pudding'll come out as light as a feather, crisp and brarn, just a top and a bottom, you might say, wi' none o' this custardy stuff in t'middle.\" Quite obviously the Mirabelle's designer version will do nothing to preserve our Yorkshire pudding heritage. Still, I optimistically put it down to the Mirabelle being rather an effete, southern sort of place. </p> <p>Then, the other week, returning to my favourite Leeds pub at the start of the football season, I ordered Yorkshire pudding as I always do. How I looked forward to its arrival, slopped over with onion gravy, almost burned on top and just-soft on the underbelly. But a stealing dread set in when I saw that it had trebled in price since I last ate it and that it was chalked up with a range of four fillings. It had stopped being an ordinary Yorkshire meal and become an olde pubbe gimmick. My worst fears were realised when the plate was set before me. It wasn't properly cooked. Its pale and doughy bottom filled most of the plate. I couldn't eat it. </p> <p>But if I, a true-born Yorkshire woman, and Marco Pierre White, a trueborn Yorkshire chef, and the Whitelocks pub in Leeds cannot make a decent Yorkshire pudding, then who can? </p> <p>It is time to go back to basics. Early Yorkshire puddings were baked underneath the spit-roast and drenched in the rich juices that fell from the cooking meat. They were also made in a vast rectangular tin and cut into squares to be served. The batter is made from a milk, water, eggs and flour (no one should be tempted to replace water with luxurious milk). It goes without saying that a northern recipe must be used. (For what would a southerner know? I have even heard of some who fondly imagines that Yorkshire pudding is always served with jam.) Even then don't expect it to be easy. Prise a recipe from any northerner and you will find it full of words like \"by guesswork\" and \"you just know\" and \"when it's ready\". Not very helpful. </p> <p>My grandmother's recipe is no more obliging. She used one heaped tablespoon of plain flour per person, plus one extra, and one egg per person (quite generous on the eggs, this recipe). Put the flour into a bowl or jug and stir in a little salt. Make a well in the flour and crack in the eggs. With a fork gradually beat in the eggs, slowly gathering up more flour from the sides and bottom of the bowl. When the mixture is smooth slowly beat in \"some\" milk and \"a little\" water (I told you it wouldn't be precise) until the batter achieves the \"right\" consistency. </p> <p>The right consistency is when it just coats the back of a spoon. Beat hard for five minutes. Now leave the batter to stand for a good half hour at least. When you've done this you might find it needs a little more liquid (a little more guesswork required here). Next skim the fat, or beef dripping, from the juices that have collected round your roast and use it to grease the Yorkshire pudding tins. Put the tins on the top shelf of a belting hot oven until the fat is really smoking hot. Pour in the batter, pop them in the oven \"until they're ready\". </p> <p>If all this still sounds like too much trouble, and if you really have to, the supermarket shelves are piled with ready-made versions - testament to the fact that we like to eat but cannot make Yorkshire puddings. The ubiquitous Aunt Bessie's simply requires a little reheating. Sainsbury's own-brand ones come, uncooked and frozen, in individual little foil saucers, and you have the pleasure of watching them puff up into perfectly shaped puddings in the oven. And I don't want to be too complimentary but they don't taste bad either. Good enough, at least, for southerners.</p>",
  "<p>Not since Saatchi &amp; Saatchi launched its ill-fated bid for Midland Bank has the advertising industry been seen to embrace consolidation so enthusiastically. Having lagged behind the companies they serve for more than a decade, ad agencies have in the past year rushed to buy, or be bought, in an often bewilderingly rapid feeding frenzy. </p> <p>This activity is a belated mirroring of what has been happening among their multinational clients. As global industries consolidate, they are looking increasingly for a single company that will cater for all of their ad requirements worldwide. It means there are fewer, but much larger and more lucrative, ad accounts in play, so smaller agencies will find it more difficult to survive as global clients seek to work with the biggest global agencies.</p> <p>According to Paul Richards, a media analyst at stockbroking firm WestLB Panmure, the other major factor behind the drive to consolidate is a desire for economies of scale. \"Each of the big groups wants to have two, maybe even three, global ad agencies. It's not just ad agencies - economies of scale are particularly important to media buying agencies. And there's a whole range of below-the-line activities - healthcare, PR, direct marketing - that clients now expect their agencies to offer.\"</p> <p>But until recently, ad industry efforts to consolidate have been severely hampered by conflicting client interest. Advertisers do not like to use agencies that work for rivals in their sector, just as they rarely employ professional advisers who work for direct competitors. A proposed merger between the French group Publicis and Young &amp; Rubicam of the US was scuppered recently when Y&amp;R's biggest client, Ford, objected on the grounds that Publicis handles ads for rival car manufacturer Renault.</p> <p>Perhaps the most notorious example is Procter &amp; Gamble. As the world's biggest advertiser, it wields enormous power over its agencies. Until recently, P&amp;G refused to allow its four main agency networks - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Grey Advertising, Leo Burnett and MacManus - to belong to the same holding company as an agency handling competitor's work. The most extreme illustration of P&amp;G's draconian rules came when Saatchi &amp; Saatchi demerged from Cordiant Communications in 1997 because its status as a P&amp;G roster agency meant Bates Worldwide - Cordiant's other agency network - could not pitch for any household product advertisers.</p> <p>But early last year P&amp;G, realising that its rules meant it no longer had the world's biggest and most powerful agencies on its roster, let it be known quietly that any moves towards expansion would be looked on favourably. This has acted as a catalyst to industry consolidation and, in the past year alone, the balance of power has changed dramatically.</p> <p>The first P&amp;G agencies to oblige were the US groups MacManus (owner of the UK's D'Arcy and IMP agencies) and Leo Burnett, which owns the UK agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty. Last November, the two of them linked up with Japan's largest ad agency, Dentsu, to form the oddly-named B Com3 (according to its founders, the name is derived from \"beacon\"). B Com3 is now the world's fourth-largest ad organisation, behind Britain's WPP and Omnicom and IPG of the US, and it is expected to use its forthcoming flotation to bankroll further acquisitions.</p> <p>It was assumed that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi would follow suit and merge with Grey Advertising, which is publicly quoted but controlled by its 73-year-old chairman and chief executive, Ed Meyer. But in June Publicis, having lost out on a deal with Y&amp;R, surprised the industry by launching a $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) friendly takeover of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The move created the world's fifth-largest ad company, with substantial media buying interests in the form of Publicis' Optimedia and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's 50% stake in Zenith Media.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, Publicis scored a coup when it bought the privately-owned US ad hot shop Fallon McElligott - known for its award-winning creative work. But this proved to be a mere hors d'oeuvre for the French group's acquisition-hungry chairman, Maurice Levy, who has seen Publicis leap up the global agency rankings - from tenth to fifth - in less than a year.</p> <p>But the most dramatic shift in the global agency rankings came in May when the London-listed WPP group added Y&amp;R to its two agency networks: J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. The $4.7bn (\u00a33.2bn) deal meant WPP leapfrogged its two US rivals, Omnicom and IPG, to become the biggest ad services company in the world. The merger created a gold standard by giving WPP many of the biggest names across all marketing disciplines, including direct marketing and media buying. </p> <p>WPP is now expected to merge its media arm, and the world's largest media specialist, MindShare with Y&amp;R's the Media Edge - ranked fourth. For the year to December 31 1999, the combined group had revenues of $5.2bn (\u00a33.5bn).</p> <p>In addition to bringing three of the world's leading ad agencies under one roof, the deal united four of the biggest public relations agencies: WPP's Hill &amp; Knowlton and Ogilvy Public Relations, and Y&amp;R's Burston-Marsteller and Cohn &amp; Wolfe, as well as Y&amp;R's below-the-line agency, Impiric, and WPP's OgilvyOne.</p> <p>So, after contenting itself with two agencies for years, WPP has fallen into line with the US trend of having three. Both of the other ad super-groups - Omnicom and IPG - adopted the three-legged model in the 1990s. IPG departed from the norm last year when it merged Ammirati Puris Lintas with Lowe, but that was in anticipation of acquiring another agency.</p> <p>The multi-agency structure makes sense because it allows companies to take on conflicting business by keeping their agency subsidiaries separate. But even this system has its limitations. Even though P&amp;G has softened its conflict policy, any links between its agencies and those that handle work for its biggest rival Unilever are still out of the question. And car manufacturers, particularly in the US, still insist on the rigorous demarcation of agency groups, with General Motors using Interpublic, Ford employing Y&amp;R and Daimler Chrysler using True North Communications. </p> <p>Nevertheless, WestLB Panmure's Richards believes there is considerable scope for further consolidation. He says: \"It's still a very fragmented industry. WPP, the biggest player, still has only a few per cent of the total market, so there is room for a lot more consolidation. Cordiant and True North is a likely deal. They are two medium-sized agencies and, geographically speaking, they are a good fit. Cordiant is strong in Europe but weaker in the US, whereas True North is strong in the US but needs to improve its European capability. Grey is a good match for Publicis Saatchi.\"</p> <p>Cordiant chairman Michael Bungey admitted recently that he had held talks with True North, and a string of recent acquisitions suggest he is fattening up the company for a sale. Cordiant executives are thought to be holding out for the \u00a31.2bn Publicis paid for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - a company of a similar size. The group is also thought to have held talks with IPG, which has been seeking a major acquisition since its attempts to buy MacManus failed last year. Either way, Cordiant is unlikely to remain independent for long. And once it has been snapped up, only one top 20 UK agency - M&amp;C Saatchi - will remain independent.</p> <p>It is a far cry from 15 years ago, when the UK top 20 was dominated by home-grown independent agencies such as Dorland Advertising (now Bates UK) and BMP, now part of Omnicom's DDB network, and the UK outposts of US ad giants such as JWT and O&amp;M.</p> <p>The Saatchi brothers, following their unceremonious ousting five years ago from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the agency they built up from scratch, are expected to think carefully about ceding control of M&amp;C Saatchi. But, realistically, their attempts to build a global network are unlikely to succeed in the face of competition from the new super-groups. Recent press reports suggest M&amp;C would consider joining the new Publicis/Saatchi grouping, although this theory seems to owe more to the famous Saatchi spin than good commercial sense.</p> <p>Ironically, it was Saatchi &amp; Saatchi that started the trend towards industry consolidation when, more than a decade ago, it embarked on an ambitious buying spree aimed at turning it into a global one-stop shop for business services. The agency expanded from ads into direct marketing, sales promotion and PR, before coming unstuck when it tried to move into financial services. Now it seems Martin Sorrell, former finance director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and now chairman of WPP, is showing them how it is done.</p>",

  "<p>The all-conquering march of the internet has triggered a media acquisition spree. Dot.coms and software companies have pushed stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic to unprecedented levels of wealth, allowing ambitious broadcast and internet companies to pounce on their targets through paper takeovers.</p> <p>Highly-valued shares are used as currency in these bids, resulting, for example, in the blockbuster, \u00a3220bn all-share merger earlier this year between internet company AOL and media giant Time Warner.</p> <p>But the key to this year's media frenzy, which has seen more than \u00a3290bn worth of mergers and acquisitions, is a revolution in content distribution. Broadband access allows film, television, music and radio content to be downloaded from the internet, creating the perfect e-commerce opportunity for any media company.</p> <p>It also adds a much-needed perspective to the bewildering amount of cash being thrown at start-ups that have yet to make a profit. Last year, Yahoo! paid \u00a33.5bn for Broadcast.com, which has posted nothing but losses throughout its short existence.</p> <p>The AOL and Time Warner deal combines blockbuster brands such as CNN, Netscape, Warner Bros, CompuServe and Time Magazine. According to the new company, it also created \"the world's first fully integrated media and communications company for the internet century.\" </p> <p>Time Warner's CNN.com and Entertaindom.com sites will get priority on AOL space; with AOL taking advantage of Time Warner's Road Runner broadband network. </p> <p>Companies are virtually guaranteed larger profits and increased market share if they control both distribution and content. Walt Disney is a prime example, having launched a series of canny takeovers throughout the 90s. It owns film and production companies (Touchstone Pictures and the ABC Entertainment Television Group), which supply programmes to the television network (ABC), which in turn helps to promote Disney's cable channels (ESPN, Lifetime Television, E! Entertainment Television and The History Channel). And these cable channels have tie-ins with Disney's book publishing division, Hyperion. </p> <p>These synergies keep every aspect of a media company's products in-house, ensuring no money is lost through licensing or outsourcing.</p> <p>Britain does not have a big hitter in the AOL or Time Warner league, but there is plenty of room for consolidation, and for companies on the merger trail to snowball. Newly-demerged Granada Media recently paid \u00a31.75bn for the Meridian, Anglia and HTV ITV franchises owned by United News and Media.</p> <p>Granada always wanted to be the leader of the pack in the rush to shake up ITV, which is facing a surge in competition from hundreds of digital and cable channels. The company owns TV interests Granada, LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and has the cash and boardroom expertise to grow, particularly if media ownership regulations are relaxed.</p> <p>Granada will have to sell one of United's franchises, probably HTV, as the Broadcast Act dictates that a company must not have more than a 15% audience share. Elsewhere, local radio station owners cannot own local newspapers in the same region.</p> <p>These regulations allow a broad range of media voices to be heard, but prevent companies from growing into global players, such as France's Vivendi. Granada's \u00a37bn value is dwarfed by AOL Time Warner's \u00a3220bn price tag, and Vivendi's \u00a362bn. </p> <p>Juggling the need for diverse output and to nurture globe-straddling companies is a factor being considered in a white paper being put together by the department of culture, media and sport and the department of trade and industry.</p> <p>British media companies should follow developments across the channel, where Vivendi and its Canal Plus pay-TV unit paid \u00a319bn for Canadian spirits and entertainment group Seagram. This represents Europe's most impressive response to the AOL/Time Warner merger, in combining Seagram's massive entertainment portfolio, including the Universal film and music businesses, with an internet and telecommunications network. </p> <p>Vivendi's ambitious chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, wants to establish a foothold in Britain. He has already established the Vizzavi internet portal with Britain's largest company, mobile phone giant VodafoneAirtouch, and could try to form an alliance with BSkyB.</p> <p>BT will be one to look out for next year, when the broadcasting ban on its networks is lifted - making it an even more attractive takeover target. If BT can ward-off predators with a restructuring programme, its fledgling Yes Television arm could provide Murdoch with serious competition.</p> <p>Another likely participant in the takeover battles to come is the FTSE-listed, \u00a314bn media company RTL, which spans 11 countries. Channel 5's major shareholder - a combination of Pearson's TV business and Luxembourg-based broadcaster CLT-Ufa, owned by the Bertelsmann empire in Germany and GBL of Luxembourg - is a dark horse in the media mega-merger race. And RTL is determined to increase its intimidating size through acquisition. </p> <p>Only 10% of the company is being floated and its war-chest will be built up as more shares are offered to investors. Any company with the combined firepower of Financial Times-owners Pearson and Bertlesmann will have a significant role in the balance of European media power.</p>",
  "<p>The world is in the grip of merger mania, with European link-ups and buyouts alone worth a mammoth \u00a3400bn so far this year. The corporate marriages and takeovers are seen as the best way to generate short-term profit growth and grab greater market share.</p> <p>The sky-scraping sums generated by these deals also guarantee publicity in an environment that is not renowned for its scintillating news stories. </p> <p>The link-up between US internet giant AOL and multimedia conglomerate Time Warner hit the headlines for creating a company worth a staggering \u00a3220bn. The takeover saga involving Vodafone AirTouch and Germany's Mannesmann, meanwhile, was a multibillion pound soap opera, with the final price escalating to \u00a3114bn.</p> <p>But mergers are risky, time-consuming and do not have a good track-record. A recent study by accountancy firm KPMG found that 83% of mergers did not improve shareholder value. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development says the number of mergers is rising, but they often fail to increase profitability. The main obstacles include staff defections, company integration and the domestic and EU regulatory maze.</p> <p>The merger process is secretive, with big-name advisors such as Merill Lynch and Morgan Stanley keen to protect clients' business strategies; not wanting to lose lucrative merger business. Banks advise on every part of the process, particularly the chances of the deal being knocked back by regulators.</p> <p>One adviser says: \"Mergers are very complicated and you have to do so many things right, such as integration at every level and agreeing a price. They are not easy things to complete.\"</p> <p>Even if the tricky obstacles of price and integration are overcome, there is the unpredictable factor of what the regulators will say. Broadcasting regulators put paid to the proposed marriage of ITV franchise holders Carlton and United News &amp; Media and a link-up between US telecoms giants Worldcom and Sprint was torn apart by EU officials. If a merged company threatens to monopolise its sector, it will go the way of Microsoft and be broken up.</p> <p>\"People are now much more wary of competition issues, because of the mergers that have been put on hold. Directors end up doubting if they should go ahead, particularly if you're six months down the line in a merger and suddenly you are not allowed to do it. There may be some good reasons for blocking it, but six months is a long time,\" the advisor adds.</p> <p>But the real danger that lurks within mergers is integration. Another recent KPMG survey found that 80% of a deal's value stems from having a successful integration strategy, including the sharing services and removing duplicated departments or jobs. A US study of 500 mergers in the banking and insurance sectors shows companies that develop integration skills are more likely to perform well after the deal is completed. A prime example is BMW's takeover of Rover, which was a fiasco from day one because the German car giant failed to impose its management culture on Rover, allowing it to drift towards receivership.</p> <p>The advisor continues: \"Some mergers come unstuck, and it is easy to knock them. If you look at Vodafone AirTouch and Mannesmann, you see that they can be a huge success if the companies integrate well.</p> <p>\"But it is the management culture that drives mergers and integration, as there need to be similar cultures within the two organisations. It's a matter of the management making the deal work.\"</p> <p>These challenges do not put off corporations, because there is constant board-level pressure to deliver short-term growth. A successful link-up will give company profits a shot in the arm by providing access to an established revenue stream and customer base. In addition, the stock market likes winners, and being the senior partner in a merger makes a company look confident and exciting. Then there is a psychological factor a work: companies hate to look as though they are missing out on a trend or falling behind their competitors.</p> <p>The pressure to exploit the true value of a merger is intense. While the timetable for these deals is not set in stone, the board must produce \"value\" as quickly as possible. A common target is to triple revenue within the first year or two of a merger or acquisition. Failure to realise these aims damages market confidence in a company and makes the chief executive's position uncomfortable.</p> <p>There are a lot of considerations, but business is all about taking risks and in mergers the cost of failure and success is directly proportional.</p> <p> REASONS FOR MERGING</p> <p>1) To improve market share by accessing new markets. 2) To acquire new brands or take control of competing products. 3) To improve the company's infrastructure, particularly in relation to IT or technology. 4) To reduce costs and boost efficiency. 5) In the interests of globalisation and to increase the company's international reach.</p> <p> MERGER TYPES</p> <p>There are three types of merger, although the time-scale to complete the deal, and the regulatory rules in each sector, may differ.</p> <p>Horizontal: This is when a company links up with another one that is at the same production level - for example, a car manufacturer merging with another car manufacturer.</p> <p>Vertical: This is when a company merges with another one that is at a different stage in the production cycle. A forward vertical merger is one stage ahead, such as a car manufacturer taking over a car hire company; a backward vertical merger might involve a manufacturer taking over a tyre factory.</p> <p>Conglomerate integration: This is when two companies with no apparent links merge.</p> <p> What you need for a merger:</p> <p>1) Squads of lawyers: do not even think about going near a merger target without a team of lawyers to tell you what to do, guide you through regulation hell and stand in the corner looking as though they know better than you - which they will.</p> <p>2) Loads of cash: lawyers are not cheap, and neither are cash takeovers. Also, a failed merger bid will knock millions of pounds off a company's stock market value. So line your pockets.</p> <p>3) Lucky horseshoe: there are several committees and institutions waiting to pore over mergers or takeovers, and it is sometimes impossible to tell if they are going to block the deal. Good luck charms will not sway the secretary of state for trade and industry, but they will make you feel better.</p> <p>4) Accountant: ensure your money-man is good, as the sums of money involved are terrifying and you have to squeeze every last penny of shareholder value out of the deal. Cross-border revenues will drop you in a tax quagmire, which could affect the balance sheet.</p> <p>5) Decent restaurants: never negotiate over the telephone. It is always best to hammer out a corporate marriage over a plate of foie gras on a bed of distressed cous cous, because it makes you look important, and you can stick the crippling wine bill on expenses.</p> <p>6) A public relations company: these days financial PR companies are a dime a dozen, but they are vital for presenting the deal, keeping blood-hound journalists at bay and getting that all-important stock market approval. A sceptical market could scupper a paper merger.</p> <p>7) A graphic designer: your new company will need a logo and name. The Nike \"swoosh\" was designed by a student for \u00a325, but be prepared to shell out a lot of money if you want your brand to have a better reputation than Dunlop Green Stripe.</p> <p>8) A fondness for Belgium: if you think the euro is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse, then you are in for a rough ride. More and more mergers straddle international borders, are conducted in the single currency and fall under EU jurisdiction. So stop muttering about the war and get your Berlitz guides out.</p> <p>9) Driver: you need to look official as you travel from air-conditioned office to restaurant to country seat, so make sure you have a driver or your merger partner may develop status issues. </p> <p>10) Integration strategy: Ensure you know what will happen to the staff and IT systems of both companies, because a deal can look good on paper but promptly fall apart through a corporate culture clash.</p>",
  "One of the intriguing features of Arab politics is that the serious bickering usually takes place beneath a shower of pleasantries, while outright threats are rarely as menacing as they at first seem. <p>In the language of international relations, Arab countries are invariably described as \"brotherly\" and non-Arab countries (with the possible exception of Israel) as \"friendly\". \"Brotherly\" doesn't mean that they're on good terms, just that they're fellow Arabs. But for one Arab country to refer to another as merely \"friendly\" would be rude.</p> <p>Even in the midst of quarrels, there's an assumption that Arab countries, because of their shared language and culture, have - or ought to have - a special relationship with each other. Some have taken it even further, aspiring to create a single, unified Arab nation.</p> <p>Back in 1945, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Yemen got together to form the Arab League, as a first step towards Arab unity. About the same time, European leaders were developing similar ideas: in 1946 Winston Churchill called for a \"United States of Europe\" - though it was not until 1957 that the Treaty of Rome formally established the European Economic Community.</p> <p>Since then, Europe has achieved integration at many levels, while the Arab League - despite having grown to include 22 countries and a population of more than 200m - has barely got beyond the starting blocks.</p> <p>To see why, we need look no further than the aims stated in the league's charter: to coordinate policies and achieve cooperation between member states, but also to safeguard their independence and sovereignty.</p> <p>Fifty years ago, in the immediate post-imperial era, it was natural for emerging countries to guard their sovereignty jealously. But the world has moved on, and experience in Europe shows that you can't go very far down the road of coordination and cooperation, let alone integration, without sacrificing a degree of sovereignty.</p> <p>Despite its rhetoric about cooperation, the Arab League's charter is basically designed to protect the sovereignty of individual members. Article VII, for example, says that unanimous decisions are binding on all member states (and why not, if they've all voted in favour?), but majority decisions are binding only on those states that have accepted them.</p> <p>This is a rather grand way of saying that members can do as they like. In fact, the charter goes on to say that each member is free to implement the league's decisions \"according to its respective laws\". In other words, even when members agree on a specific course of action, there is no guarantee that they will all interpret what they have agreed in the same way.</p> <p>The league's charter also requires members to \"respect the systems of government established in the other member states and regard them as exclusive concerns of those states\". So if one Arab country complains, for instance, about systematic human rights violations in another, it could be in breach of the charter.</p> <p>Sovereignty is one of the few western political concepts that Arab leaders have had no hesitation in adopting and making sacred. It originated in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries when the emerging nation states were looking for a secular basis for their authority.</p> <p>For a long time, sovereignty was thought of as absolute: the right to do whatever you want in your own backyard. But that simply isn't true. Light a big bonfire in your backyard and neighbours will soon complain about the smoke and smell.</p> <p>Over the last half-century in particular, national sovereignty has been eroded in many ways - by international law, by international bodies such as the United Nations, by economic and environmental interdependence - and the process is accelerating. Even the idea that governments can control the flow of traffic across their own borders is breaking down, at least where electronic information is concerned.</p> <p>This does not mean that sovereignty is worthless - just that we should be realistic about it.</p> <p>In a slightly different context, the Israelis and Americans have been making similar points about Jerusalem. Sovereignty, they say, is relative, or perhaps even symbolic. The important thing is the way the respective powers are divided up.</p> <p>An Israeli source, quoted by Ha'aretz newspaper the other day, said that what matters in the Haram (Temple Mount) area is not so much the sovereignty as \"the law in effect at the site and its enforcement, planning and building arrangements, and maintaining security. If someone opens fire on the Temple Mount or tries to attack a mosque, which policeman will arrest him, who will judge him?\"</p> <p>This is true. The trouble is that it's often used to draw the wrong conclusion: to say to the Palestinians that since sovereignty isn't everything they might as well give it to the Israelis.</p> <p>If a practical solution is to be found for the Old City and holy sites in Jerusalem, it may well require everyone to abandon their claims of sovereignty and concentrate instead on the underlying substance.</p> <p><a href=\"http://192.203.180.62/mlas/charter.html\" target=\"_new\"> Charter of the Arab League</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>An Unspeakable Betrayal: Selected Writings of Luis Bu\u00f1uel </strong> translated by Garrett White (California, 266 pp., \u00a317.50, 20 April, 0 520 20840 4 )<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364043,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>\"Studio Vingt-Huit - high up a winding street of Montmartre, in the full blasphemy of a freezing Sunday; taxis arriving, friends greeting each other, an excitable afternoon audience.\" The description is Cyril Connolly's, the occasion a showing of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's first film, Un Chien andalou. The audience seemed baffled at the end, and some of its members were angry, unprepared no doubt for what Connolly called the \"destructive reverence\" of the film. \"With the impression of having witnessed some infinitely ancient horror, Saturn swallowing his sons, we made our way out into the cold of February 1929, that unique and dazzling cold.\"</p> <p>Connolly's sense of the horror of the work, and of its romance (\"Un Chien andalou brought out the grandeur of the conflict inherent in romantic love, the truth that the heart is made to be broken, and after it has mended, to be broken again\"), led him to ignore its farcical aspects, its echoes of Buster Keaton and its complementary truth that romantic love is as often as not a matter of violent grabs and dashes, a pantomime of lust wagging its human puppets. But his experience anticipated that of thousands of others. The first film we see by any major director usually makes a mark, but we don't always feel we have seen Saturn swallowing his sons. </p> <p>The first Bu\u00f1uel film seen by most people of my generation who were not film-club addicts was probably Viridiana (1961). After two Surrealist films made in France (Un Chien andalou and L'Age d'or, 1930), and an astonishing documentary made in Spain (Las Hurdes, 1932), Bu\u00f1uel's career was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. He spent some time in the United States, then in 1946 settled in Mexico, where he made 18 films, of which only Los Olvidados (1950) got any real notice. Viridiana was made in Spain under Franco, and caused a tremendous scandal. After that Bu\u00f1uel made one more film in Spain (Tristana, 1970), two more films in Mexico (The Exterminating Angel, 1962, Simon of the Desert, 1965), and six films in France (Diary of a Chambermaid, 1964, Belle de jour, 1966, The Milky Way, 1969, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, 1972, The Phantom of Liberty, 1974, That Obscure Object of Desire, 1977). </p> <p>Viridiana has a number of startling and now famous images - a small crucifix flicks open to become a menacing knife; riotous, feasting beggars compose themselves into a parody of Leonardo's Last Supper, a snatch of Handel's 'Hallelujah Chorus' blaring in the soundtrack - and a ferocious implied argument about charity. All charity which is less than infinite leaves the world unchanged, and what charity is not less than infinite? Yet the most memorable feature of Viridiana, I think, is not its imagery or its argument but the harsh, reckless intelligence behind it, its manifest intention to disturb us beyond repair. Bu\u00f1uel used to say in lectures and interviews that his films are designed to show us that we don't live in the best of worlds. They certainly do that, but the formulation is not strong enough. Whatever we think about the world we live in, Bu\u00f1uel wants to send us home from the cinema feeling rattled and uncomfortable. This feeling, mysteriously, is not incompatible with being highly amused, but then the very idea of amusement seems troubling. \"Viridiana, at heart, is a humorous film,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in a typescript published in An Unspeakable Betrayal, but immediately adds that the humour is \"corrosive\". </p> <p>A few months after seeing Viridiana for the first time, I was in Spain, and met a charming man, a doctor, who claimed to know Bu\u00f1uel intimately, and to have helped him recruit the beggars for that film. I can't remember whether I believed him or not. Probably I did. Bu\u00f1uel for me was as distant as Cervantes or Saint Teresa, and I didn't even know where he lived. Then I forgot about the encounter, except for thinking kindly of the doctor and Madrid whenever I saw Viridiana again, or when my mind turned to Spain. And with time I certainly ceased to believe in the story. The doctor was entitled to his fantasy, after all; Bu\u00f1uel was the kind of figure who attracted legends and anecdotes. Then some 13 years later I saw The Phantom of Liberty. </p> <p>Right at the beginning of the film a group of Spanish prisoners is led out to be shot by Napoleon's soldiers. They include Bu\u00f1uel himself, as a monk; Serge Silberman, Bu\u00f1uel's producer; and the writer Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn, an old friend of Bu\u00f1uel's. They also include the uncannily familiar figure of my old acquaintance the doctor, Bu\u00f1uel's pal Jos\u00e9-Luis Barros. It took me a while to place the recognised face, and of course I didn't fill in all the details even then. A few years later I met Bu\u00f1uel in Mexico. He was delighted when I told him the story - he loved coincidences - and thought it would have been even better if Barros and I had turned out to be long-lost twins, perhaps identified by a birthmark. I hang onto that moment in the cinema because when I saw the film and found the face I realised I had caught a piece of lost time. Not only Madrid and Dr Barros and an earlier self, but Viridiana as it felt when I first saw it: blasphemous, brilliant, ragged, indifferent to the preoccupations of unity and coherence which most aesthetics demand - Saturn swallowing a daughter. </p> <p>If I had been less devoted to the notion of the death of the author I might have got more out of my encounters with Bu\u00f1uel himself. But I'm not sure. He was so courtly and entertaining, so willing to treat me as a new-found friend rather than a nosy writer, that I had real difficulty in thinking about our conversations as material. Material for what? For the book about his films I was trying to write, or the biography I had no intention of writing? The anecdotes he told were the ones he usually told, often ones I'd already read somewhere: his stock of stories. He was a 78-year-old famous man, he had his best memories organised, he had shaped them into tales, and he was soon to put them in a book called My Last Breath (1982), which he wrote in collaboration with his scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re. </p> <p>Didn't I gather rich insights into the films? Some, but not as many as you might think. This was manifestly the Bu\u00f1uel who made Bu\u00f1uel's films, there were plenty of continuities between the mind I'd met in the work and the mind I was meeting over drinks. The author was fully alive in that sense, and discussing his films with Bu\u00f1uel was a delight. But I didn't understand the films a whole lot better for talking to him, and any language I might find for writing about the films was going to be quite different from the language in which I could describe him, if I was even going to try to describe him. A person is not a film, and films have all kinds of adventures once the director has finished editing them. \"I don't believe one's life can be confused with one's work,\" Bu\u00f1uel says in the book I've just mentioned. </p> <p>What I did get from meeting Bu\u00f1uel, apart from much pleasure and laughter, was a feeling for the kind of artist he was, the peculiar mixture of austerity and mischief he brought to the cinema. You can see this in the films as well, of course, but there is so much else in them, so much obsession and yearning, so much appetite for pain, so much unappeased theology. All this must have been in the person somewhere, certainly, but it wasn't in the person you met. He had trained himself, I believe, to save his nightmares for his movies. What was left in daily life was a curious mind and an imagination always playing with possibility, but above all his craft and his career, the sense of film as an art and a discipline, a kind of experiment in which even the wildest jokes took on a certain aspect of rigour or purity. </p> <p>I met Bu\u00f1uel in July 1978, through an old friend, Santiago Genov\u00e9s, a Mexican anthropologist. Santiago, born in Spain, always called Bu\u00f1uel Don Luis, and after a bit of practice, so did I. I saw him a number of times in company over the next three years, and I had many conversations with him in the late afternoons. The last time I saw him was in June 1981. I didn't go back to Mexico for a while after that, and he died in July 1983. </p> <p>First impressions. He is old, bent, has rather crooked teeth, large intelligent eyes behind heavy glasses. An amiable, mischievous grin resides almost constantly on his face. He is very deaf, but can hear if you speak loud and clear, although communication is always a little uncertain, apt to misfire or lose its sequence. A small terrier called Tristana trots in and sits on the sofa. Don Luis, the scourge of actors and actresses, can't get her to move or leave. \"I am a monk,\" he says, \"I don't go out.\" It's largely true. The world comes to him, insofar as he allows it to. But it doesn't come much or often. He says he feels old, that he was \"formidable\" between 40 and 60, and felt fine in his 60s. Now he can't remember the name of the pills he's supposed to take for his diabetes, he starts to do a sum and can't remember what he has just multiplied by what. He feels dizzy at times. He says all this with genuine impatience and distaste, but also with an energy which comes out as a kind of unshakable gaiety. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel likes some contemporary directors, but not many. American films, he says. Woody Allen. Stanley Kubrick. \"That film with those shots of the man's eye.\" \"A Clockwork Orange?\" \"That's the one.\" Nice thought, coming from the man whose film career began with the image of an eye slashed by a razor. Bu\u00f1uel tells me a Hitchcock story, which he tells again in My Last Breath. There is a dinner in Bu\u00f1uel's honour at George Cukor's house in Hollywood in 1972. Fifteen famous directors are there, including John Ford, Rouben Mamoulian, Robert Mulligan, George Stevens, Robert Wise, William Wyler, Billy Wilder. Hitchcock sits next to Bu\u00f1uel, says very little, then at one point puts an arm round his companion's shoulder and says with deep admiration: \"Bu\u00f1uel, that wooden leg in Tristana. That wooden leg.\"</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel and his wife Jeanne lived in a small and tidy house in the southern central part of Mexico City, the place Bu\u00f1uel called \"this metropolis without end\". Both had become Mexican citizens in 1949. The street was a quiet cul-de-sac off a busy thoroughfare; the house had a small enclosed garden. \"Come and see me when you like,\" Bu\u00f1uel would say, \"but telephone first to set up a time.\" I would telephone, talk to Jeanne, and ask if I could see Don Luis. She would consult him, and he would invariably say: \"How about tomorrow around five?\" So I learned not to call if I couldn't go the next day. </p> <p>Generally I would watch a film of his at the Mexican Cineteca and then drive over to his house. I would say, \"I saw El today, or Robinson Crusoe,\" or whatever I had seen, and he would say: \"Terrible film, the director should be shot.\" I would murmur in polite disagreement, and ask him a question about the work. One day I said I had very much liked a French film he had made in Corsica, Cela s'appelle l'Aurore (1955). \"Yes,\" he said. \"I liked it when I made it.\" He didn't care for technical queries, and I discovered that general questions, critics' questions, didn't interest him, that he didn't want to discuss ideas or meanings. But he would talk about all kinds of things, if you could get him started on the right sort of detail - the ostrich in close-up at the end of The Phantom of Liberty, say, the garrulous duel between Jansenist and Jesuit in The Milky Way. He even loved ideas. He just didn't like the idea of them. </p> <p>One day I didn't offer my polite disagreement. I had been to see his A Woman without Love (1951), a version of Maupassant's novel Pierre et Jean, a truly terrible film by any standards, without a single redeeming or even interesting moment, as far as I could see. In My Last Breath, Bu\u00f1uel was to say this was \"no doubt my worst film\", but I didn't then know that he thought that. A number of Bu\u00f1uel's Mexican works are jagged and uneven, but virtually all of them have luminous features, touches that reveal the quirky or reckless hand of the master. Not this one. I said I didn't think the director should be shot but the film was awful, and asked what happened.</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel nodded, remembering. Finally he said: \"I couldn't think of anything\" - \"No se me occuri\u00f3 nada,\" literally \"nothing occurred to me\". He couldn't think of anything? Yes, he knew the film was boring from the start but assumed something would occur to him while he was shooting, some gag or angle or twist that would liven it up. That was how he worked, and almost always something occurred to him. There is a little fable about art here. You plan carefully, and you leave room for inspiration, in fact you rely on its arrival. But then inspiration, always an uncertain dancing partner, fails to show up, and you just keep going and finish the job. Then you make another plan. </p> <p>I was then rather keen on the idea of Bu\u00f1uel as a permanent Surrealist, of Surrealism as a continuing state of mind, and so was slightly shocked to hear him place the movement so firmly in the past. \"When I was a Surrealist\", he said, and \"in the days of the Surrealists\" - as if the group was a club or a team you could join or leave. He was right, of course, Surrealism was always a thinner, more privileged form of revolt than it liked to imagine it was - or than I liked to imagine it was. The bourgeoisie revolting against the bourgeoisie, Bu\u00f1uel said in My Last Breath. But there is a continuing mentality, too, which has to do not with shock or rebellion but with resistance to settled or predictable meanings: resistance to interpretation itself, if by 'interpretation' we mean not just trying to make sense of things but succeeding in doing it. </p> <p>Early in our first conversation we spoke about That Obscure Object of Desire, then a recent film, which was to be Bu\u00f1uel's last. This work, notoriously, has two actresses playing a single role, that of the taunting, endlessly desired Conchita, the role played by Marlene Dietrich (on her own) when Sternberg made The Devil Is a Woman, his film based on the same novel. There is a single fictional character, with a name and a mother and a place in the plot, and indeed a single voice on the soundtrack, that of Carole Bouquet. On the screen, though, we see Carole Bouquet alternating with Angela Molina. They look quite different, although audience reactions to this trick have varied immensely: some people haven't noticed it, and some haven't been able to take their minds off it, and many have had reactions situated somewhere in between. The point, for most viewers, is to make meaning out of the alternation. The point for Bu\u00f1uel was to defeat meaning. There was to be nothing psychological about the switches, he said to me, no Jekyll and Hyde story, only random alternation. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel's films are full of touches like this, there to scramble old meanings, not to provide new ones, and they could have been fuller of them. Bu\u00f1uel himself was proud of the idea of the two actresses but was ready to agree that it was crazy - he had started shooting, in Paris and Madrid, with one actress, Maria Schneider, and when he fired her thought the production was over - but Serge Silberman, his producer, took to the suggestion instantly. Unlike Oscar Dancigers, the producer of Los Olvidados, who had persuaded Bu\u00f1uel to take a series of similar moves out of the film: a full symphony orchestra playing in a building under construction, a glossy top hat briefly glimpsed on a stove in a Mexico City hovel. </p> <p>Most viewers would miss these moments, Bu\u00f1uel thought, and those who saw them would wonder what they had seen, just as we wonder, in That Obscure Object of Desire, whether we have really seen two actresses or weirdly misremembered just one. Dancigers's view, which Bu\u00f1uel accepted in practice without agreeing to the principle, was that the director was ruining the film. \"I don't care if I ruin films,\" Bu\u00f1uel said. This could be a motto for him: when he is lucky, his films are the ruins of films he didn't want to make. </p> <p>My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Bu\u00f1uels' house in 1978. There were a number of guests, much festivity, champagne, many Spanish jokes. Everyone had a good time, and I had a small illumination. This orderly, good-humoured house, these kindly people: isn't there something odd here? Only what Bu\u00f1uel has taught us to find odd. We are the people who managed to have a meal together, unlike the characters in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. When the meal is over, we shall be able to leave (we were able to leave), unlike the characters in The Exterminating Angel. Bu\u00f1uel himself is not outside the world he criticises, he is part of it, and so are his friends and family. Social arrangements are foolish and apparently fragile, because they are so arbitrary and groundless. Everything about them could be different, and is different in other times and places. </p> <p>\"Everyone is a barbarian for someone,\" as a character says in The Phantom of Liberty: \"on est toujours le barbare de quelqu'un\". And yet it is because these arrangements are arbitrary and groundless that we have so little purchase on them, and they seem so strangely unchangeable. The radical instability of things in Bu\u00f1uel's films is a wish, an act of fictional defiance, the expression of a political and moral need. Their durability in reality is their discreet and remorseless excess of charm. Bu\u00f1uel's great subject is the intimate failure of the bourgeoisie to revolt against the bourgeoisie. </p> <p>Hence Bu\u00f1uel's fondness for heretics, and stories about heretics. Heretics are not atheists, outsiders, they are believers who believe something different, they are with us and not with us. That's why we have to persecute them, or why, if we are the heretics, we get persecuted. The Milky Way, Bu\u00f1uel said, could have been made about any form of heresy, artistic, scientific, sociological. He chose religious heresies because he happened to know something about them - because of his Jesuit education, he said. Bu\u00f1uel attended a school in Zaragoza that sounds at all points identical with the school Stephen Dedalus attends in Dublin in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</p> <p> There is something disingenuous, even mischievous, about this claim, since Bu\u00f1uel's religious preoccupations are clearly more firmly anchored than the remark suggests, more like a trauma than an option. But the intellectual reach of the idea is interesting, and says something about the intimacy of failed revolt in Bu\u00f1uel's works, from L'Age d'or through Los Olvidados, Nazar\u00edn, Viridiana, Tristana and The Phantom of Liberty. Heretics often suffer dreadfully because they are so close to the doctrine they dissent from. But then they are close to it. Even their dissent can be seen as a form of complicity, a failure to get outside the engulfing system. This is a revolt which can't escape its family of thought, which will always have been the secret friend of its worst enemy. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel was born in Calanda, near Teruel, in Spain, just over 100 years ago (22 February 1900), but he insisted that the place itself plunged him into an older time.\"My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere\"; \"I had the good fortune of spending my childhood in the Middle Ages.\" One effect of this ancientness was that his films, after a certain point, stopped ageing, since they so fluently mingled contemporary violence, drugs, high-tech killers, up-to-date political jokes with much older customs. When a car hits a tree in The Milky Way, a voice comes out of the car radio preaching a sermon on the pains of hell. The text is from a work by Fray Luis de Granada, a medieval mystic. The voice is Bu\u00f1uel's. Although Bu\u00f1uel thought that film, as a medium, was peculiarly the \"victim of time\", he managed if not to refute time at least to confuse it. When the Argentinian writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar uses the word 'Bu\u00f1uel' as an adjective he means skipping without warning \"from Actium to the Anschluss\" - or as happens in L'Age d'or, from an imagined foundation of Rome to a troubled 1930. </p> <p>This is not quite the impression we get from the rather miscellaneous collection of materials in An Unspeakable Betrayal. Time's hand is all over this work, pushing everything remorselessly towards the past. The book is an English-language version of a French book published in 1995, which in turn contained work assembled in Spanish in 1982. Some of the material was even gathered in Francisco Aranda's biography of Bu\u00f1uel, published in Spanish in 1969, and available in English in 1975. </p> <p>The book opens with a selection of whimsical prose pieces Bu\u00f1uel published between 1922 and 1927. Some are Surrealist avant la lettre - Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath that he wasn't much interested in Surrealism until well after he moved from Madrid, where he had studied, to Paris in 1925 - and some are literally Surrealist. The cymbals in an orchestra are said to be \"light shattered into fragments\"; a personified wind, \"howling with delight\", uproots trees, spins houses round and turns \"three priests sneaking down the street into as many inverted umbrellas\". A piece of roasted meat takes a walk, has all kinds of adventures. The least dated of these self-consciously artful pieces is perhaps 'La Sancta Misa Vaticanae', which describes a competition held in Rome to see who can say mass fastest: </p> <p>At the word 'go', the priests begin to say mass as fast as they can. Turning toward the faithful to say the Dominus vobiscum, making the sign of the cross etc, they reach incredible speeds, while the altar boy goes back and forth with the missal and the other ritual objects. A few fall down exhausted, like boxers. Finally, Mos\u00e9n Rendueles, of Huesca, is declared the winner, having said the entire mass in a record 1 minute and 45 seconds. As a prize he receives a monstrance and a large Aragonian wicker basket. </p> <p>An Unspeakable Betrayal also has the texts of a brief pre-Surrealist play called 'Hamlet', which Bu\u00f1uel put on with his friends in the cellar of the Caf\u00e9 Select in Montparnasse (\"At the end of each act, the peasants will be foreshadowed\"; \"Marquises artificially bleed to death along the nauseating walls\"), and of a rather learned lecture on the puppet theatre. The rest of the book offers a selection from Bu\u00f1uel's film criticism, a handful of more theoretical pronouncements on the cinema, some notes on three of his own films (L'Age d'or, Las Hurdes and Viridiana), some screenplays and/or synopses, including the version of Un Chien andalou which Bu\u00f1uel published in La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste in 1929, and some autobiographical jottings. </p> <p>Already in the late 1920s Bu\u00f1uel liked American films, especially the comic shorts of Ben Turpin, Harry Langdon and above all Buster Keaton. \"The finest poems that cinema has produced\", he said of American two-reelers, \"far more Surrealist than the films of Man Ray.\" \"'Keaton's films,\" Bu\u00f1uel wrote, \"give lessons to reality itself.\" He loved Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc (\"the humanity in these faces floods the screen and fills the room\"), and was very funny about Adolphe Menjou's moustache (\"a page of Proust brought to life on the upper lip\"). What Bu\u00f1uel has to say about film as a medium, about d\u00e9coupage and close-ups and the rest, is rather disappointing, since it seems like watered-down Eisenstein - but then we have the films. Among the later work in the volume is a set of film ideas which Bu\u00f1uel noted down some time in the 1940s (probably), and called 'Gags'. This one anticipates a moment in The Exterminating Angel: </p> <p>\"The owners of the castle and their guests, some six or seven people in all, climb the staircase of the main hall to go to bed. In the corridor on the second floor, where various doors lead to their rooms, they bid one another good night and retire. A short while later, one of the guests cautiously leaves his room on a mysterious expedition. As he approaches the staircase he hears the nearby voices of people coming up the stairs. They are exactly the same people as before, who again say good night and retire to their rooms.\"</p> <p>And this one has several echoes in Bu\u00f1uel's last films, especially The Phantom of Liberty: \"In a room, with four candles placed around it, is a coffin in which lies a very beautiful woman who might be the bride. As the protagonist draws near her, the corpse opens its eyes and says: 'Would you mind leaving me in peace?'\"</p> <p>There is also an unlikely treatment, written in English in 1937 for Paramount, for a film about Goya and the Duchess of Alba, which is so terrible that Bu\u00f1uel must have had the time of his life writing it. Goya is \"a large man, warm, passionate, yet retaining the peasant's virtues of simplicity and sincerity\". He saves the Duchess from a street escapade, but she doesn't yet know who he is. \"He leads her into the atelier where the walls are covered with paintings that are famous all through Spain. The Duchess regards them in amazement. 'You are Goya!' she exclaims. He nods.\"</p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel said of Un Chien andalou that it was \"nothing other than a desperate, impassioned call for murder\", although his misguided audiences (\"this imbecilic crowd\") kept finding it \"beautiful\" or \"poetic\". Bu\u00f1uel's sons Juan Luis and Rafael rather ungratefully repeat the charge in a brief afterword to this book. \"That's what his films and writing were all about. To provoke, to shock, to destroy a society that he found corrupt and idiotic, to ridicule a religion that had oppressed millions of people and continues to do so... Now many of his books and belongings have been put into museums.\" </p> <p>Or even reprinted in works published by university presses. We might rather say, as I think Bu\u00f1uel himself would later have said, that if an audience can mistake a call for murder for a beautiful poem, there is something wrong with the work as well as the audience. Or something wrong with the description of the work. What Bu\u00f1uel learned magnificently to do as a filmmaker was to make it impossible for us to settle for beauty and poetry, however much we liked the works. The desperate call for murder was more than a metaphor but less than a programme, a response to the pain of a world which not even the most extreme violence could alter. </p> <p>The last time I saw Bu\u00f1uel we had an extended talk about chance. I had said how much I liked the moments in Tristana where the main character forces herself or her companions to make choices between two virtually identical things, to prefer one over the other: the chickpeas on her plate, the pillars of a colonnade in a courtyard, two narrow streets in Toledo. Bu\u00f1uel said that the things are not different but you can make them different. You look at any two identical things, two copies of the same book, two objects of the same colour, and they begin to seem different. \"This red is more red.\" Then you act on this invented difference and your life changes - or it doesn't. </p> <p>This way of thinking is about as far from determinism as it could be, but it doesn't seem to afford much human freedom. Our acts would have scarcely any antecedents, we could literally go either way with the chickpeas or the streets or the books or the colours: chance masquerading as choice. But then these same acts are heavy with consequences, just as they would be if we had made fully considered choices between radically different alternatives. We create a moment of meaningless freedom and then we squander it. Or perhaps we create the momentary flicker of freedom because we know the larger options are not available to us. When Tristana chooses between two chickpeas or two pillars, she insists on the real but slight difference between the candidates: \"There's always a little something that makes me like one of them more.\" The despairing corollary to this view would be that differences as slight as this convert every choice into a self-deluding game. On the other hand, when Tristana takes the street to the right rather than to the left, she meets the man who is to become her lover. Would she otherwise have missed him?</p> <p> What we call causes, Bu\u00f1uel says in My Last Breath, are really a limitless profusion of chances. \"Chance is the great master of all things. Necessity arrives only afterwards.\" Did Bu\u00f1uel believe this? Not exclusively or always, but it was one of his favourite stories about human behaviour, and I suddenly remember that at one time he was planning to make a film of Gide's Les Caves du Vatican, a novel predicated on the notion of the acte gratuit. The acts in Tristana are gratuitous in their making, but a mere phantom of liberty in their effect. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

  "The final terrifying moments of Air France flight 4590 were revealed yesterday when French accident investigators released their preliminary report on last month's Concorde crash outside Paris, in which 113 people died. <p>A transcript of the cockpit voice recorder shows that the supersonic jetliner, starting a flight from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport to New York, ploughed into a hotel in the small town of Gonesse, just one minute 17 seconds after its pilot, Christian Marty, was told it was on fire. </p> <p>It shows that the crew, who were unable to retract the undercarriage, had lost all power in one engine and could neither accelerate nor gain altitude, tried desperately to reach Le Bourget airport, nearby. </p> <p>Marty's last words, at a few seconds after 2.44pm on July 25, were: \"Too late... no time.\" The co-pilot was then heard to say: \"Le Bourget, Le Bourget. Negative; we are trying Le Bourget.\" Sixteen seconds later the recording ends. </p> <p>At 14.45 the control tower informed the fire and emergency services that the flight, carrying 100 mainly German passengers and nine crew, had crashed near Le Bourget. A minute later air traffic control announced: \"To all listening aircraft, please hold back a moment. We will try to pick ourselves up and recommence take-offs.\" </p> <p>The 90-page, highly technical report contains little new information on the crash, which prompted Air France to ground its remaining Concordes immediately and British Airways, the only other airline to fly the ageing supersonic jet, to follow suit nearly three weeks later. </p> <p>The investigators from the French accident inquiry board (BEA) confirms the hypothesis that a burst tyre set off the fatal chain of events which brought the plane down, killing all those on board and another four people on the ground. </p> <p>\"The July 25 accident shows that the destruction of a tyre, an event that we cannot say will not recur, had catastrophic consequences in a short period of time, preventing the crew from rectifying the situation,\" the report says. </p> <p>\"The crew had no way of knowing about the nature of the fire nor any means of fighting it.\" </p> <p>It also confirms that a small metal strip, probably from another airplane, was found on the runway. </p> <p>\"It has holes in it and in some of these holes appear to be Cherry aeronautical rivets. This strip has not been identified as coming from Concorde,\" the report says. Cherry is a type of rivet not used on Concorde. </p> <p>The BEA said last month that the 40cm piece of metal almost certainly gashed the Concorde's tyre, sending large chunks of rubber hurtling at tremendous speed into the plane's fuel tanks, which are contained in its delta-shaped wings, and starting the blaze. </p> <p>\"Shortly before rotation [take-off speed], the front right tyre of the left undercarriage became damaged and tyre fragments were projected against the fuselage,\" the interim report, released on the internet, says. </p> <p>\"At least one fuel tank was ruptured in one or more places, resulting in a substantial fuel leak. </p> <p>\"The leaking fuel caught light and a very violent fire ensued throughout the duration of the flight. Engine problems occurred in engine number 2 and, briefly, in engine number 1. The aircraft flew for approximately one minute.\" </p> <p>The report formally recommends that Concorde's airworthiness certificates should be suspended until \"appropriate measures have been put in place to guarantee a satisfactory level of safety as regards the risk associated with tyre blow-outs\" - a step the civil aviation authority and its French equivalent, the DGAC, carried out on August 16. </p> <p>Over the 25 years Concorde has been in commercial operation, there have been at least seven potentially catastrophic incidents in which one or more of its tyres have burst, leading to punctures in the wings or fuel tanks. </p> <p>But in all those incidents it was a piece of flying metal - from the undercarriage or water deflectors - that caused the damage, not tyre rubber itself. Safety efforts were therefore concentrated on strengthening all the metal parts that could be broken off in a tyre burst, but not on protecting the wings themselves. </p> <p>Stressing that the catastrophe could have happened at any time, the investigators say:\"Experience in service has shown that a tyre blow-out during taxiing, landing and take-off is not an improbable event on Concorde and that such an event is indeed capable of causing structural and system damage. However, a blow-out of this kind has never before led to a fuel fire.\" </p> <p>The report does not contain any analysis or final conclusions about the cause of the disaster, and notes that the sequence of damage and the links between the various events have \"not yet been fully established\". The final report may not appear for several months. </p> <p>Earlier this week the transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, held out hope that the planes might fly again. \"I am not saying it is over with Concorde,\" he said. \"But we need guarantees that such a chain of events cannot happen again.\" </p> <p>But aviation experts have said commercial considerations may well rule that out. </p> <p><b>Sequence of events</b></p> <p>13.58 Crew contacts control tower to plan pre-flight sequence. </p> <p>14.07 Controller gives permission to start, confirms runway 26 right as requested by crew. </p> <p>14.34 Ground controller gives the plane permission to taxi toward the runway. </p> <p>14.42 and 17 seconds Controller. \"Air France 4590, runway 26 right, wind zero 90 knots, authorized takeoff.\" </p> <p>14.42.21 Co-pilot: \"4590 taking off 26 right;

  "<p>Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo was yesterday facing a fresh \"conflict of interest\" row with his \u00a310,000 consultancy for an American oil and chemical giant clashing with his launch of a Tory campaign to axe Labour's new energy tax. </p> <p>Mr Portillo will be limited under Parliament's strict advocacy rules from initiating any action in the House of Commons because the Kerr McGee Corporation would be one of the companies hit by Labour's climate change levy which targets chemical giants. </p> <p>The US firm - which has extensive interests in the North Sea oilfields - also backs the US policy of trading \"emission permits\" which Mr Portillo enthusiastically supported during an interview on the BBC Today programme yesterday. </p> <p>\"The Americans have a very good idea for the control of emissions and I think that is one of the routes we should go,\" he said. \"They issue permits for people to emit, to put gases into the air and then there's a great incentive on those businesses to reduce their emissions because they can sell those permits on to others ...\" </p> <p>He added that it did not require \"all the administration and bureaucracy, civil servants and waste\" entailed in the government's complicated tax proposal. \"If we are going to be a prosperous nation and we're going to create wealth in order that we can have good public services, we have to be first of all a competitive country,\" he said. </p> <p>The tax was likely to drive business away from Britain to countries where energy practices were less efficient. \"Therefore there will be a net loss to the global environment,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Portillo has already had to apologise for not declaring his connection with the oil group when he condemned petrol tax rises in the Commons. Then Christopher Leslie, Labour MP for Shipley, called on him to resign his consultancy. </p> <p>Last night another Labour MP, Fraser Kemp, who represents Houghton and Washington, said: \"The public are entitled to know that when Mr Portillo is talking on behalf of his party or the country that he is being paid by a foreign multi-national. He should either resign his consultancy with Kerr McGee or resign the shadow chancellorship. He cannot have two jobs.\" </p> <p>The financial secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Timms, criticised Mr Portillo's plans. </p> <p>\"Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today,\" said Mr Timms, who added that using the climate change levy as a means of tackling the problem had been negotiated extensively with businesses. </p> <p>Business groups gave the Tories' plans a cautious welcome. John Cridland, deputy direc tor-general of the Confederation of British Industry said: \"This is a useful contribution to the debate that pinpoints many of our current concerns.\" </p> <p>Chris Humphries, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"It appears the Opposition has embraced wholeheartedly many of the concerns we have already raised over the regulatory and tax burden faced by UK businesses, though more detail is necessary before business can reach an informed view.\"</p>",
  "Up to 3m people will be forced to undergo DNA tests after Tony Blair unveiled plans yesterday to record the personal details of every person arrested in Britain. <p>In a move criticised by civil rights campaigners, the prime minister announced an extra \u00a3109m to ensure that DNA samples from \"virtually the entire criminally active population\" are stored on Britain's DNA database. </p> <p>Speaking to police officers in Kent, the prime minister swept aside civil rights concerns as he outlined plans to add an extra 3m samples to the existing 940,000 samples held on the police DNA database by 2004. </p> <p>\"I believe that the civil liberties argument is completely misplaced,\" Mr Blair said. \"This is using technology to catch criminals.\" </p> <p>The prime minister's plan will allow police officers to take DNA samples from any person arrested for a \"recordable\" offence, ranging from shoplifting to murder. Police already have the powers to carry out such tests but the high costs involved - each test costs \u00a340 - means that officers only tend to take DNA samples from people arrested for the most serious offences. </p> <p>One home office source said: \"The extra money will allow the police to take DNA samples from suspects at the lower end of the scale - the average burglar may leave DNA samples at several properties.\" </p> <p>Ministers believe that civil rights campaigners are wrong to object because DNA samples will be destroyed if a suspect is released without charge or is acquitted. However, DNA records of suspects who are cautioned will be kept. </p> <p>The civil liberties group, Liberty, said last night that Mr Blair's plan would increase the number of DNA samples which are allegedly held illegally by the police. Mary Cunneen, the group's associate director, said: \"The forensic science laboratory currently holds 50,000 DNA samples unlawfully. This is a clear breach of privacy for the individuals concerned and Liberty would be very interested in pursuing a judicial review.\" </p> <p>The prime minister's announcement - his first major policy initiative since returning from his summer holiday on Tuesday - was one of the highlights of the government's \"law and order week\" as ministers attempt to regain the initiative over crime. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, launched the fightback on Wednesday when he unveiled the first national police recruitment campaign. Mr Blair will attempt to maintain the momentum in Glasgow today when he declares that all drug offenders will be forced to undergo special treatment. </p> <p>Downing Street decided to make crime the theme of the week after Labour's private polling showed that the Tories had pulled ahead on law and order in the wake William Hague's controversial interventions on asylum and the jailing of the Norfolk farmer, Tony Martin. </p> <p>One Downing Street source said ministers hoped to undermine the Tories by pointing out that expensive anti-crime initiatives, such as the new DNA tests, would be in jeopardy under the Tories because of Mr Hague's plans to impose \u00a316bn spending cuts. </p> <p>Mr Blair will attempt to reinforce his \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" image today when he unveils plans to force all drug offenders to undergo treatment. In a speech in Glasgow, the prime minister will say that a series of pilot projects of new drug and treatment orders show that they drastically reduce the re-offending rate. </p> <p>Offenders who escaped the treatment committed 107 offences a month. This contrasted with 10 offences from those who underwent treatment. \"Treatment orders help to break the link between drugs and crime,\" Mr Blair will say. </p> <p>The prime minister believes that extra resources can transform the fight against crime. However, he made clear yesterday that the criminal justice system would have to embrace reform. \"I think we have effec tively got a 19th century justice system in a 21st century world,\" he said. </p> <p>He criticised the court system in particular. \"It is run far too much for the convenience of the individual court,\" he said. </p> <p>However, the prime minister faced mild embarrassment when the chief constable of Kent, his host yesterday, questioned the government's police recruitment campaign. Sir David Phillips said successful policing was not just down to \"the decorative presence of a few patrolling officers\".</p>",
  "<p>The threat of Germany's Kirch shedding its 3.1% stake in BSkyB has been hanging over the stock for months. Yesterday it finally happened and the company placed some 58m shares with investment banks Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs, netting \u00a3583m in the process. </p> <p>The shares were placed at \u00a310.05 each and sold to institutional investors at \u00a310.25. </p> <p>Kirch acquired a 4.3% stake in BSkyB at the end of last year and sold part of it in June. The pay-TV company, in which BSkyB has a 24% holding, will use the cash to help fund the roll-out of its digital services. </p> <p>As a consequence of the sale the price of BSkyB shares fell back 44p to a three-month low of \u00a311.25, comfortably, or rather uncomfortably, below their March peak of \u00a321.58, the inevitable effect of a large tranche of shares hitting the market at once. That could, however, make this a good time to step in. </p> <p>It is worth remembering that some recent block sales of shares have not got away easily and, although the BSkyB sale was at what one dealer described as a \"thumping discount\", the appetite is clearly there for the shares. </p> <p>\"In the past few months a lot of uncertainties have been removed,\" said one media analyst. \"BSkyB has retained the Premier League football broadcasting rights, taken control of [interactive service] Open, which has been a huge success, and now the concern over the Kirch stake has been removed. With those three things resolved, BSkyB is a much cleaner story.\" </p> <p>The view was echoed by Paul Richards at ABN Amro who described the shares as a strong buy. </p> <p>\"It has the leading position in pay television in the UK by a country mile and taking full control of Open was a very smart thing to do. They also have a significant stake in the only digital satellite player in Germany, which is pretty valuable.\"</p>",
  "<p>The boss of Punch Taverns, one of the UK's biggest pub companies, has called for \"very serious\" government intervention to prevent the Belgian group Interbrew from dominating Britain's beer industry. </p> <p>Punch's chairman, Hugh Osmond, said Interbrew's proposed purchase of breweries from Bass and Whitbread would lead to higher beer prices and the demise of traditional ale brands. </p> <p>\"This is effectively a merger of Bass and Whitbread. If that ain't anti-competitive, nothing ever will be,\" he said. </p> <p>Punch is among Interbrew's largest customers, with 5,150 pubs. Mr Osmond has told the office of fair trading that he thinks the acquisitions are \"a pretty dubious thing to allow to happen without some very serious conditions\". </p> <p>There has been speculation that the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, will order Interbrew to sell some lager brands - the group will own Stella Artois, Carling and Tennent's, with a 32% share of the entire beer market. </p> <p>Mr Osmond said that even after the sale of brands Interbrew and rival brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle could control the availability of beers through their distribution networks. </p> <p>Lorries from the two big groups supply a range of drinks to 80% of Britain's pubs and, although they carry products from other manufacturers, Mr Osmond claimed they favoured their own beers. </p> <p>\"Selling a brand is not enough unless you sort out the distribution issue. For the average pub company the only distribution option is one of the big brewers but mostly, whatever they say, they're not keen on distributing their competitors' products. </p> <p>\"This is doing exactly what the Beer Orders and the European commission have been trying to stop - it's preventing access to the market.\" </p> <p>Mr Osmond added that prices were bound to rise: \"We can't make Interbrew's numbers stack up unless they increase their market share and increase their prices. </p> <p>\"We're not going to sit by and let that happen.\" </p> <p>Interbrew's \u00a32.3bn deal with Bass is being considered by the office of fair trading, which will advise Mr Byers on whether to order a full inquiry by the competition commission. An Interbrew spokesman described Mr Osmond's remarks as premature, saying: \"With all due respect for this person, let's just wait and see what the OFT thinks.\" </p> <p>Interbrew argues that the biggest brewers in other European countries have higher market shares, and that the sheer number of different beers available in Britain makes it one of the most competitive markets in the world. </p> <p>Punch and the Japanese bank Nomura are the country's biggest pub owners, each with just over 5,000 houses. Punch became a major player last year when it paid \u00a32.7bn for Allied Domecq's 3,500 pubs after a vitriolic bidding battle against Whitbread. </p> <p>Mr Osmond announced plans yesterday to allow more than 5,000 employees to buy shares in Punch, ahead of a possible flotation in \"two to three years' time\". </p> <p>The shares, in either the group's tenanted or managed pubs business, are on offer at 30p each. This values the business at \u00a3364m, although it has debts of more than \u00a32.5bn. </p> <p>Mr Osmond and his management team own about 30% of the company, with the balance held by venture capitalists. Employees will be offered a total of 4%.</p>",
  "The prime minister will today be told by his father-in-law to seize control of state pensions from the Treasury and offer a fairer deal to older people. <p>Tony Booth, the actor, makes his intervention in the bulletin of the National Pensioners Convention, which is led by Jack Jones, the former transport workers' leader. Mr Jones is planning to launch an offensive on pensions at the Labour conference later this month. </p> <p>Although Mr Booth, Cherie Blair's father, has previously criticised the government's style and centralising tendencies, this is understood to be his first attack on policy. \"Tony Blair is my son-in-law and I know him to be a decent man ... The pensioners now need Tony Blair to demonstrate that fundamental decency,\" he says. </p> <p>According to his article, the chancellor's increase of 75p a week on the state pension in the last budget was \"insulting and derisory\". </p> <p>\"We know Gordon Brown is possessive of what he considers to be Treasury territory, but ... on this issue, Brown has got it very wrong. The prime minister is the first lord of the Treasury. </p> <p>\"He can and should now intervene to raise the basic pension to a living rate and ensure that all future increases are in line with average wage increases rather than, as is currently the situation, inflation. It is time for this government to remember that the measure of a fair and just society is how well it takes care of all members of that society.\" </p> <p>Mr Booth is expected to speak at a pensioners' lobby of parliament in November alongside Mr Jones and the former Labour minister Lady Castle.</p>",
  "St John's wort, a herb used for thousands of years to treat nervous complaints, has been found to be just as effective in treating mild to moderate depression as a leading antidepressant drug. <p>Hippocrates, Pliny and Galen all described St John's wort, which has the Latin name hypericum perforatum, as a treatment against possession by demons in ancient Greece. </p> <p>It is available over the counter in high street pharmacies. A paper in the British Medical Journal says doctors should give it to depressed patients in preference to imipramine, the most commonly used tricyclic antidepressant medicine. </p> <p>There have been small studies of St John's wort's effect on depression before, but this research compared the herb with the full dose of imipramine that would normally be prescribed for mild to moderate depression. </p> <p>The study involved 324 out patients at 40 clinics in Germany, half of whom were given St John's wort and half the antidepressant. The patients did not know which they were receiving. Their decreasing depression was measured using standard psychiatric tests. </p> <p>The scientists, led by Helmut Woelk, medical director of the Akademisches Lehrkrankenhaus der Universit\u00e4t Giessen, found that St John's wort was just as effective in alleviating the depression of the patients as was the conventional drug, with fewer side-effects. </p> <p>\"In view of the mounting evidence of hypericum's comparable efficacy to other antidepressants and its safety record, hypericum should be considered for first line treatment in mild to moderate depression,\" they write. </p> <p>There may be reluctance among some GPs in the UK to begin prescribing a herbal medicine in preference to tricyclic antidepressants, but there is likely to be enthusiasm among patients. Herbal medicines have become increasingly popular, causing concern in medical circles because herbs can interact with conventional medicines. Patients who take them often do not tell the doctor, either because they do not see the need or for fear of scorn. </p> <p>There have been warnings that St John's wort can affect transplant patients by countering the anti-rejection drug cyclosporin. The medicines control agency has also warned that the herb can interfere with the contraceptive pill. </p> <p>The study found, however, that taken by itself for depression, it did not cause the side-effects typical of the tricyclics - dry mouth, sweating, dizziness, nausea, asthenia and headache. </p> <p>In the imipramine group, 41 (25%) had one or more of these side-effects. In the St John's wort group, 13 (8%) reported side effects, the most common of which was a dry mouth. Four patients on St John's wort dropped out of the study because of side-effects, compared with 26 on imipramine. </p> <p>The biggest worry over the tricyclic antidepressants is the possibility of fatal overdose. The Prozac class of drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have become more popular because there is no such risk, but there have been other concerns about their safety. </p> <p>The report says: \"Patients seen in general practice frequently prefer to bear the symptoms of depression rather than sustain the side-effects of treatment with antidepressants. An effective antidepressant with no (or comparatively few) side effects would be an optimal treatment. Hypericum seems to meet these criteria.\" </p> <p> <b>Alternative cures</b><br></p> <p> Herbal medicine aficionados say thousands of years of use prove effectiveness; doctors demand scientific proof.

  "The fate of the Kursk cast a fitful light on a drama beneath the waves to which we normally give little thought. The 500 or so submarines of many nations that ply their stealthy way through the oceans may not seem a large number. But submarine competition between countries is a cause of problems and dangers worthy of sustained attention. <p>This is an undersea world in which new technologies are barely under control at the same time as old technologies decay and collapse. It is also a world in which largely untested theories of offence and defence drive hugely expensive developments which could engender the very conflicts governments seek to avoid through the maintenance of naval strength. </p> <p>Submarines represent at the same time the least vulnerable way of carrying and launching nuclear weapons and the most effective way of limiting a nuclear strike by destroying some of the other side's ballistic missile submarines. Apart from their deterrent function, they are a vital element in maintaining control of the high seas. They are also vital in sea-based intervention - in the so-called \"expeditionary\" strategy to which most navies now subscribe, whether they see their job as mounting such expeditions or defeating them. </p> <p>The submarine, in other words, underpins deterrence, sustains sea control, and is critical in intervention. But one has to pause here to question the logic of all this. </p> <p>What was the Kursk doing in the Barents sea? It was presumably practising its main job, which is to protect Russian ballistic submarines from American attack submarines - perhaps also to attack American ballistic-missile submarines, if the balance between the two navies were ever to permit that. When you render down what the Kursk's captain wrote to the mother of one his young sailors, with its impressive phrases like \"battle capable\", this is what was meant: the Kursk's job was to ensure that Russia's ballistic submarines could launch as many nuclear missiles as possible at North America and western Europe. </p> <p>Why is Russia still doing this, when a nuclear war between the west and Russia has become inconceivable? The Russian navy has been run down to the point where its surface fleet is about the same size as Britain's, but it still has a large submarine force with deterrence as its main function. </p> <p>In part, Moscow goes on with this because submarines are something it was good at in the cold war. The new Akula class, extremely difficult to detect and powerfully armed, was giving western admirals nightmares as that conflict ended. In part, Moscow goes on with it because the United States' approach to nuclear arms control is lackadaisical and compromised by the recent infatuation with national missile defence. Those policies almost force Russia to continue to deploy nuclear weapons to which it is \"entitled,\" and which can be seen as bargaining chips in negotiations with America. Finally, of course, there is Vladimir Putin's desire to reform and strengthen Russia's military forces as a means of restoring its prestige, influence, and national pride. </p> <p>Reasons in plenty - but are any of them good enough, singly or altogether, to justify not just sending young men and boys to the bottom, but the risks run by the whole world when a nation at an economic and technological low attempts to keep a superpower navy at sea? </p> <p>There is a dangerous irrationality here, but it is not just Russian. Nuclear submarines are on the technological frontier. They are not easy things to keep going, as the Royal Navy has found: one of our submarines has been languishing unrepaired in Gibraltar since May, and some believe that nine of 12 of our non-ballistic boats are out of service at any one time. The French probably have similar problems. Chinese nuclear submarines rarely put to sea. When they do, fingers are crossed. Other countries, some of them even less capable of controlling the technology, are beginning to hanker after nuclear submarines. </p> <p>It is probably true that the only navy that can run a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines efficiently and safely is that of the US, but even there accidents have happened. When we thought we all had to do these things, such risks could be defended with a degree of plausibility that is lacking now. The costs, meanwhile, are large. The next generation of American nuclear submarines will cost $2bn each. Then there is the cost of disposing of obsolete craft. The terrible scale of the Russian problem is known, but the problem is not confined to them. </p> <p> Acquisition of submarines by countries which previously had few or none goes on. In most cases, governments seek to buy conventional submarines - but they do so in part to counter the advantage of countries which have nuclear-powered submarines. Developments initially to do with deterrence are thus closely linked with those to do with conventional conflicts. </p> <p>The strategy, or rather strategies, that have emerged divide the globe into two classes - those who can project power, and those who wish to frustrate that projection. Submarines are arguably the most important single instrument for both classes. For the supreme power projector, the US, the submarine is a valuable collector of intelligence, the safest platform for precision strikes against land targets and a vital protector of surface ships. </p> <p>Those who aspire to some capacity to project power, like Russia, China, Britain and France, follow, at a huge remove, down this American road. But, equally, for those who want to offer effective resistance to a descent on their shores by the forces of the US, American-led coalitions, or other big countries, the submarine is the weapon of choice. </p> <p>Improved propulsion systems for conventional submarines which give them more endurance and make them harder to detect, as well as better weapons and targeting techniques, mean that relatively weak countries can mount a serious threat to expeditionary forces, including the nuclear submarines that accompany them. Where such intervention depends on an assurance of low casualties, such threats might be effective. </p> <p>As the cold war ended, a British naval officer wrote that \"we are going to need a strategy that doesn't start with the Threat\". There have been, and continue to be, ways in which sea power can enhance the security of the nations, stop or limit conflicts, rescue people in trouble or bring aid to them. But the pity is that we have held on to \"the Threat\" by maintaining, on both sides, submarine forces built around the deterrent. Even if those forces are somewhat reduced, they are surely still indefensible. At the same time we could face a new naval race between intervening powers and those who would resist them. There are indeed dragons under the sea. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>E-commerce firms could exploit monopoly powers to rip off consumers, the office of fair trading warned yesterday. </p> <p>\"Competition authorities worldwide are facing the challenge of ensuring e-commerce flourishes in a competitive environment,\" said John Bridgeman, director general of fair trading. \"The balance to be struck is that of protecting consumers without stifling innovation.\" </p> <p>Setting-up costs on the internet are comparatively low, which should promote competition, but the OFT said firms that grab the limelight by being the first to enter an area of e-commerce might gain an entrenched position. </p> <p>\"Reputation, branding and customer loyalty will become increasingly important and may create significant first-mover advantages,\" the OFT said.

  "As the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, paid his respects yesterday to the immigrant whose murder ignited an international scandal about Germany's neo-Nazi right, it emerged that the dead man's widow had fled her home in fear of her life and was living in hiding under police protection. <p>Three young men set upon the Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano in a park in the eastern city of Dessau on June 11 and kicked him for so long and so hard that he died from his injuries three days later. </p> <p>His murder helped jolt Germany's political leaders into a new assessment of the threat posed by the extreme right. </p> <p>Adriano's German-born wife Angelika was not in court on Wednesday for the sentencing of her husband's murderers. The eldest of the three racist thugs who attacked him was given a life sentence. His two 16-year-old accomplices got nine years each. </p> <p>John Greene, an American who represents an anti-discrimination group in Dessau, said yesterday that Ms Adriano left her home on Saturday. \"I know that she planned it after receiving threatening telephone calls. Then a letter came threatening her life and the lives of her children,\" he said. </p> <p>A leader of the immigrant community in Dessau said the writer of the letter had threatened to blow up the flat she shares with her three children, the youngest of whom is six months old. </p> <p>The letter also abused her for having married an African and said her children would be infected with Aids as a result. </p> <p>Against a background of spreading European concern about the far right, Mr Schr\u00f6der was joined yesterday by the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, on a visit to Dessau. The visit was intended to highlight the German government's determination to curb neo-Nazism. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der laid a wreath of yellow flowers at the little monument which local officials have erected at the site of the murder. But, astonishingly, no arrangements were made for the chancellor to meet Mrs Adriano. </p> <p>Nor did he have any but the most fleeting contact with those working against racism in the city: he shook hands with the head of the city's multi-cultural institute. </p> <p>Nobody doubts his determination to tackle far-right violence, but he will have his hands full: xenophobia seems to be entrenched in many regions of Germany, particularly in the east. </p> <p>Heinz Wolf, a retired man, who watched Mr Schr\u00f6der lay his tribute of flowers, said he had little respect for the gesture. </p> <p>\"This won't change anything,\" he said.\"Why do we bring so many foreigners here when we have enough problems ourselves?\" </p> <p>Today Mr Schr\u00f6der will reach the end of a marathon tour of eastern Germany which has been dominated by the issue of far-right violence. Yet not a single meeting with race-relations workers has figured on his itinerary. </p> <p>Nor is there any evidence of his having discussed the issue with members of the immigrant community. </p> <p>As he visited Dessau, a new race row erupted in the state parliament in Hesse, the region which includes Frankfurt. </p> <p>The local leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) made a formal apology after Green party members claimed that a Christian Democrat MP had told a foreign-born Green MP to go back where he came from. </p> <p>They said that during a heated debate Tarek al-Wazir, who has German citizenship and a Yemeni father, was told to \"go back to Sana'a\". </p> <p>CDU members said that the phrase had been misheard, but the leader of their parliamentary group made an unconditional apology. </p> <p>Elsewhere, police in the eastern town of Cottbus reported that a group of youths shouting \"Sieg Heil\" and giving the Nazi salute had tossed two crude Molotov cocktails on to the footbpath in front of a building housing a youth club called \"Multi-cultural Europe\". There were no injuries and no damage. </p> <p>Near Stuttgart, in south-west Germany, three skinheads, ages 18 to 21, faced charges after confessing to lighting a fire in a home for asylum seekers on Wednesday.

  "<p>Actor Kevin Spacey has won over audiences as a serial killer, a hostage negotiator and an American suburbanite going through a mid-life crisis. Now he is repeating the trick in his new real life role as a business consultant. </p> <p>Instead of treading the boards on Broadway in front of the New York cognoscenti, Mr Spacey was earlier this month in the basement presentation room of Bloomberg's London headquarters, addressing a selection of fund managers from institutions including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS Warburg. </p> <p>Mr Spacey was trying to convince them to buy shares in Old Vic Productions, a new company being set up by the London theatre to fund plays and other theatrical events.

For \u00a325,000 or more the investor receives 10 complimentary tickets for all the first night productions, a dinner party at The Ivy with stage stars and champagne receptions backstage. </p> <p>It is the latter package and the corporate entertainment that come with it that the big City institutions are particularly excited about. Investors will also qualify for tax relief of 20% under the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS). Old Vic Productions plans to invest in a variety of shows so the fate of the investment does not hang on the success of a single play. </p> <p>Some of the biggest hitters in the West End are backing the venture.

  "<p>The government is facing an embarrassing revolt by nurses against the health bill to reform care of the elderly in residential homes. </p> <p>Ministers hoped the legislation, due to be announced in the Queen's speech later this year, would be a good advertisement for Tony Blair's national plan for the NHS and would particularly appeal to older voters in the run-up to a general election. </p> <p>Yesterday the Royal College of Nursing said the government's hybrid scheme, to offer free nursing but charge for personal care in residential homes, was unworkable. </p> <p>Christine Hancock, the college's general secretary and hitherto one of the NHS plan's staunchest supporters, said the college would lobby against \"an artificial distinction\" between nursing and personal care that would \"create perverse incentives and inequities\". </p> <p>In a letter to Alan Milburn, the health secretary, she urged the government to consider the consequences for nearly 300,000 elderly people in residential care homes. </p> <p>\"We acknowledge the pressure for urgent action, but believe it unwise to move on legislation until these issues are properly resolved,\" she said. </p> <p>The problem arose because of the government's rejection last month of one of the main recommendations of the royal commission on long term care, chaired by Sir Stewart Sutherland. In 1998 the commission proposed changes costing \u00a31.1bn a year that included abolition of means-tested charges in residential homes for personal care, such as bathing, changing dressings and assistance with eating. </p> <p>Mr Milburn said that he had rejected such free personal care because it would \"consume most of the additional resources we plan to make available for older people through the NHS\". He plans to spend \u00a31.4bn a year to improve health and social services for the elderly, but most would go on \"intermediate\" care for older people, to reduce time spent by them in hospital. </p> <p>His decision last month provoked anger from groups representing older people, some of whom have to sell their homes to pay for personal care in residential homes that would be free if they were in hospital. </p> <p>Ms Hancock's objection yesterday focused on the health of these elderly people, rather than their wealth. \"The plan states that 'in the future the NHS will meet the costs of registered nurse time spent on providing, delegating or supervising care in any setting'. </p> <p>\"But clearly, nursing care is not provided by registered nurses alone - a large amount of nursing care is delegated to health care assistants. Therefore the plan would create an artificial divide between nursing and personal care based on whether the care is provided by a registered nurse or healthcare assistant,\" she said. Perversely, this would discourage delegation of work to care assistants, as the government wanted. </p> <p>Ms Hancock said the college was encouraged by most of the proposals in the NHS plan and supported the principle of extending free nursing care. \"However, we are concerned that flaws in the approach to long term care funding will continue to undermine the potential benefits of such measures for the health and wellbeing of all older people,\" she said. </p> <p>The Department of Health said ministers had not yet received the college's letter. They were proposing a broad definition of nursing care that would for the first time be free in all care homes. The college would be involved in drawing up a framework for assessing every resident's nursing needs, a spokeswoman said.</p>",
  "George Monbiot (Biotech has bamboozled us all, August 24) is correct on one point - feeding the world's population will require political and social change in addition to technology. <p>However, his statement that \"organic farming is the key to feeding the world\" is selective with the facts. </p> <p>He mentions trials in Hertfordshire \"where wheat grown with manure has produced higher yields for the past 150 years than wheat grown with artificial nutrients\". This is the Broadbalk experiment at Rothamsted, where the yield of winter wheat grown on plots receiving different fertiliser treatments has been recorded since 1843. But his interpretation is wrong. </p> <p>An annual application of 35 tonnes per hectare of animal manure is required to match the yields of wheat (about 7 tonnes per hectare) achieved by annual applications of 144kg per hectare of \"artificial\" inorganic nitrogen. This rate of manure application is about three times what would be considered sensible for practical agriculture and is unachievable on any scale. To produce this much animal manure requires 5.5 cattle for every hectare of wheat cultivated (hardly a practical prospect either here or in the developing world). </p> <p>Nevertheless, since the average world yield of wheat is a pitiful - 1 tonne per hectare - any increase in fertiliser inputs, organic or inorganic, is much needed and will surely reap a benefit. </p> <p>Monbiot is also incorrect to regard the Broadbalk experiment as a test of organic farming. Although it contains a treatment receiving organic manure, this alone is not organic farming. Organic farming also depends on a rotation of crops which, in the UK, is normally three years or more of pasture containing clover (to \"fix\" nitrogen from the atmosphere into organic matter). The pasture is then ploughed up and wheat or other crops grown - these rely on the nitrogen previously fixed being released through the action of soil microbes. The yield of an organic crop will typically be 60-80% of one given fertilisers and pesticides, but it cannot be grown every year: at most three years of arable crops can be grown following three years of fertility building. It is misleading to compare yields in a single year. </p> <p>Reference is also made to studies on the control of rice blast disease in Yunnan Province, China recently reported by Youyong Zhu and colleagues (Nature, August 17). The highly effective disease resistance of modern hybrid varieties was clearly demonstrated in this work which also confirmed how well-favoured (\"sticky\") but highly disease susceptible varieties can be \"protected\" by growing them as a mixture with specifically selected resistant ones. </p> <p>We can indeed exploit to greater benefit than hitherto the wealth of biodiversity represented by the natural disease resistance genes in our crop varieties. This is particularly the case now that genetic engineering technologies will allow such genes to be readily isolated and moved from poorly adapted, low-yielding varieties or wild relatives to the highly productive varieties that a hungry world requires. </p> <p>We echo the views of the Chinese scientists when they observe: \"The current world population does not allow us to return to agricultural practices of the past - we need to maintain the benefits of modern agriculture while addressing its drawbacks.\" </p> <p><b>Prof Ian Crute </b><br> Director,  <b> Prof David Powlson </b><br> Head of soil science, <br> Institute of Arable Crops Research, Rothamsted, Herts </p> <p><b> Prof Christopher Lamb</b><br> Director, <br> John Innes Centre, Norwich</p>",
  "Box office hits such as Terminator, Robocop and Blade Runner have all played on fears of robotic intelligence running amok and mastering their human creators. In two separate developments yesterday, the nightmare appeared to inch closer to realisation. <p>Research published in Nature claimed to have made the first steps towards \"artificial evolution\" - by which robots are able to mutate and reproduce themselves - at Brandeis University in the US. In Bangkok, a security device was revealed which could be controlled through the internet: a robot primed to fire a gun when sensors detect an intruder. The reality is much more mundane. Self-replicating robots are still decades away; the Brandeis robot requires an element of human intervention in its construction. As for gun-toting robotic security guards, experts are sceptical; sensor technology is famously erratic and the notion of control by the internet is absurd, given the net's time delay. </p> <p>We have a great taste for robots - both the facts and the fiction. Robot Wars, the DIY build a robot in your garage craze, has been a surprise hit on television, notching up impressive ratings to watch Dead Metal, Sir Killalot and Shunt put \"the scrap back into metal\". But on any sober assessment this branch of scientific research faces huge limitations. Yes, it is useful when given a very narrow, specific remit and has been used in everyday appliances such as washing machines. It might prove useful in electronic commerce, where considerable research is now being done on \"intelligent agents\", software able to negotiate with suppliers. But there is still a major obstacle to its application in many fields - it cannot deal with unpredictability. That limits its uses in medicine, for example, and ensures its reliance on some level of human manipulation. For the most part, as one expert ruefully admitted yesterday, \"artificial intelligence is a technology in search of an application\". </p> <p>The difficulty is that our bid to create artificial intelligence is an attempt to copy the human brain before we have come to understand it. This is where research into artificial intelligence spills into philosophy and psychology in an area of inquiry likely to be one of the most fascinating of the century. So, anxieties about being mastered by the technology we have created are premature: until we understand ourselves better, artificial intelligence may create clever machines, but not independent life.</p>",
  "<p>Somewhere up the Mekong river, long past the last vestiges of urban civilisation, a fat man has gone mad. There's been strange stories coming out of the jungle, stories of adulation and decadence, barbarism and insanity. </p> <p>You're probably thinking of Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola's addled Vietnam epic. Martin Sheen smashing mirrors, Dennis Hopper ranting about physics, and there, at the bloody, hallucinatory end of it all, a monstrously bloated Marlon Brando as Kurtz, the inhuman logic of war made flesh. </p> <p>Which is understandable; that, after all, was what went through David Herman's mind when he heard about Tony Poe. The result, four years and three continents later, is The Search For Kurtz, an absorbing portrait of America's greatest military folly, and the psychotic who took its execution as his raison d'etre. </p> <p>Back in 1996, the idea seemed preposterous: intriguing, but preposterous. Apocalypse Now was based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. End of story. Except a pair of British journalists working in Asia, Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clarke, had heard of a covert US operation in Laos spanning the Vietnam war, and a guy named Tony Poe - a decorated Marine gone psychically AWOL in charge of a tribal battalion and later, allegedly, the inspiration for Colonel Kurtz. Returning to England, they contacted producer Herman. </p> <p>\"They had no details,\" he recalls, \"just a deeply shady ex-CIA operative called Jack Shirley.\" It was enough to convince Herman a film should be made, if not to persuade anyone to finance it. His proposal did the rounds, belatedly being co-financed by Channel 4. \"And I'll tell you,\" Herman says, \"we were blagging like lunatics. Because we had absolutely no idea whether he was even alive, far less where he was.\" </p> <p>Ascertaining he was alive was one thing. Jack Shirley, whose tales of serving with Poe checked out, was certain of it. Where he was proved trickier. With Shirley in tow, Her man, Levy, Scott-Clarke and director Derek Jones travelled from Bangkok to the dirt roads of Laos, once a paradisical retreat, now the poorest country in South East Asia. With monsoon season underway, the one overland route into Nam Yu - Pope's last base - was waterlogged, leaving a helicopter as their sole option: only, with elections in neighbouring Cambodia imminent, all three of Laos' choppers had been seconded. </p> <p>The story Herman tells of the solution - involving the Laotian Minister of Defence, a $5000 gratuity (\"which I have a receipt for\"), a provincial governor up to his neck in the opium trade and, ultimately, the gift of a Russian helicopter complete with armed guard - is as ludicrously Boys' Own as it is alarmingly plausible. </p> <p>And there, beside the Mekong, was Poe's headquarters. Or, rather, it wasn't. With Nam Yu razed to the ground, all that remained were rusted machine-gun clips and the communist commander who took Nam Yu for the Vietcong. It seemed, at the time, like a brick wall. Just as the group despaired, however, a call came from San Francisco, from a former CIA nabob called Bill Lair, who was prepared to talk. Herman and company headed for California, where Lair told them about Tony Poe and his leadership of the illicit Operation Momentum, launched in 1962 to band the Hmmong people of the Laotian hillsides into anti-communist guerillas. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't say we lost control of him,\" sniggered Lair, as if referring to some over-enthusiastic rogue. \"I don't think we ever had it.\" Which, stripped of romanticism, meant Poe arriving laden with M-16s for a decade of ungoverned mayhem. Paying the Hmmong per communist fatality, he asked for ears as proof; later, he demanded heads. And, when he eventually fled with his Hmmong wife and his drink problem as the Cong took over (to be napalmed by American troops), he left a bitter legacy: landmines still disabling Laotian children today. </p> <p>He set up home in Bangkok, fighting with the locals, but an icon among what Herman calls the \"pathetic old men,\" who followed his lead and never went home. Until the early 90s, that is, when the Thai police finally deported him back to the US. And there, living in San Francisco on a CIA pension, is where Herman and company found him. At last, the heart of darkness himself, his resemblance to Brando at his most grotesque extraordinary. </p> <p>The subsequent interview is TV at its most compelling: \"War is hell,\" Poe shrugs. \"And, if you're going to do it, let's do it with gusto.\" Unshaven and hungover, he speaks of sending disembodied ears to nervous US ambassadors as if it was a schoolyard prank, and explains that his mission failed because \"we didn't kill enough people\" - a nightmarish echo of Kurtz's dictum that \"we must kill them. Pig after pig. Cow after cow. Village after village.\" </p> <p>\"And I was so glad,\" says Herman, \"because I realised he wasn't coming across as Indiana Jones, but the sick, evil bastard he is.\" Except, of course, some people will always see Poe not as an alcoholic war criminal, but as a role model. Back in Bangkok, among the ageing US \u00e9migr\u00e9s who sit around in bars, impotent, their livers shot, they still love Tony Poe. David Herman shakes his head at the thought. </p> <p>\"They fete him as a great man. But these are the guys who saw Apocalypse Now and thought Kurtz was the hero. They thought he was the main man. The man who did things right.\" </p> <p>The Search for Kurtz, 11.05pm, Channel 4, tomorrow; repeated at 1.05am, Monday September 4; Apocalypse Now, Channel 4, 10.15pm, Monday September 4.</p>",
  "Take away the anti-semitic \"literature\", the white supremacist flag and the fact that he is railing against blacks and Jews, and it might be possible to believe that Shaun Winkler cares about nothing so much as the state of your lawn. <p>Sheltering in the shadow of a court building against 80 degrees of afternoon sun, the young landscape gardener certainly looks the part: his T-shirt torn and dirty, his work boots heavy, his combat trousers slack and baggy. But this week Winkler is proud to abandon his career on the land for a holiday spent standing up for what he believes in. And what he believes in, above all else, is his mentor, the Rev Richard Butler, founder of the Aryan Nations and an all-round racist, bigot and hate-monger. This, should there be any misunderstanding, is a description borrowed from Butler's lawyer. </p> <p>Business is going well enough for the God-fearing Winkler, though fear is probably an emotion stirred more readily when the church you attend every Sunday has as its centrepiece a bust of Adolf Hitler. \"I go to people's houses, they call me up and ask me to come back again,\" he says. \"I must be doing something right.\" Any non-white customers might not agree, but that is beside the point: he doesn't have any. Non-whites are statistically negligible in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and if it were otherwise Winkler would not choose to live in this town. </p> <p>Business for Butler, on the other hand, has never been worse. Twenty-five years after he moved to northern Idaho, a finger of land inserted between Washington state to the west, Montana to the east and Canada to the north, his movement is close to being crushed. His foe is not the wave of racial impurity, against which he has inveighed for so long, but the law, albeit in an action brought by a Jewish civil rights attorney. Morris Dees is attempting to bankrupt Butler by suing him and his organisation for damages to a mother and son who claim they were terrorised by Aryan Nations guards outside the Butler compound two years ago. </p> <p>A daily ritual is enacted in and around the Kootenai county court building in Coeur d'Alene, a town of 30,000 where the local fetish for huckleberry jam and milkshakes is balanced by an inordinate number of pawn shops. About two-dozen policemen start to assume their positions before dawn, the road outside the courthouse barricaded off and four or five more officers with binoculars on the roof of the building. </p> <p>Then there is nothing to do but wait until Butler, whose original calling was as an aeronautical engineer in California, is driven to the hearing in an aged Ford truck spewing toxic fumes and bearing licence plates proclaiming Idaho's motto: \"Famous Potatoes.\" Inside, the case proceeds, often assisted by evidence from tattooed former members of Butler's posse despite the high price he places on the virtue of fidelity. </p> <p>Forty-four-year-old Victoria Keenan claims that she stopped late one night outside the compound in Hayden Lake, a few miles north of Coeur d'Alene, to retrieve a wallet that her son, Jason, aged 21, had dropped from the car. </p> <p>The sound of her 1977 Datsun backfiring was the signal for three guards to descend from the Aryan Nations camp, chase them for more than two miles, fire at least five bullets and beat them up. \"Because you're white we're going to let you live today,\" one guard is said to have told them. Two of the guards are in jail now and the other is on the run. </p> <p>The Keenans, who say they suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, are looking for unspecified damages. If the jury sees things their way, an award, likely to be made in the middle of next week, could leave Butler with no choice but to sell the 19-acre compound, valued at $240,000. This would not be enough to cover his liability, but would deprive the white supremacists of their core and rallying point. </p> <p>Butler at first had trouble at first finding a lawyer. But now his defence is in the hands of Edgar Steele, who argues that the civil rights squad is attempting to turn a trivial matter into an assault on liberty: \"It is still legal in this country to be a bigot. It is still legal to hate. Butler quite properly erects the twin defences of both free speech and religion contained within the first amendment [guaranteeing freedom of expression]. </p> <p>\"Here we have a case involving two people whose presence at the entrance to the Aryan Nations in the dead of night is at least questionable, who get chased and given a good fright by rowdy members of the Aryan Nations, acting well beyond the scope of their authority, who sustain no physical and highly questionable psychological injuries.\" </p> <p>Outside in the street, Winkler the gardener is enjoying the attention and reflecting on his creed. \"I came here because there were too many non-whites in Pennsylvania. I saw non-whites commit crimes against our people and I decided to take a stand for what I think is right. It's not because they're black; it's their culture. They're animals. They're savages.\" </p> <p>Winkler explains how he became involved with white power groups at the age of 15 when he was taken to a Ku Klux Klan rally. \"There was this nigger state trooper and he told us to take off our hoods and the guy I was with said to the nigger: 'You try to take off my hood and I'll punch you out.' Yeah, they took him away.'\" </p> <p>The gardener was arrested himself two years later. \"That was just because of the communist police we have in this country.\" Still, it could be worse. \"I heard that in German now you can't even give a Sieg Heil salute without being arrested.\" But now the small talk has to stop because the court is about to adjourn for the day and that means it's time to put on a show. First there is a hunt for some bagels, which are torn into pieces so that they may be thrown at the Jewish civil rights lawyers. Then more skinheads arrive and a small corridor is formed. Above it are the Aryan Nations banner and three Confederate flags. </p> <p>A man in his late 30s appears on the scene to give the zealots a pep-talk. He tells them: \"I don't want to see you guys yelling and screaming and getting arrested because we're better than that.\" Out comes Butler with his cropped white thatch, shuffling his way towards the arthritic Ford, his right hand raised towards his supporters. The old man with the complexion of dried orange peel is helped into the truck and off he goes back to the compound, which is guarded by his three German shepherd dogs, Fritz, Nazi and Hans. They are there to protect the church with the Hitler bust, his offices lined with extremist tracts, the watchtower, the men's and women's barracks and the shower area with a red swastika on the roof. His followers are left to trail across the car park opposite the courthouse, chanting a ragged anthem. Four of them get into a new green Buick and drive away, pausing only to wave pedestrians across the road in front of them. </p> <p>It is easy to see why Butler's lawyer wants to make much play of his contention that his opponents are trying \"to paint this rag-tag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organised, well-trained and disciplined military organisation\". But Aryan Nations is taken seriously enough by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms: seven \"photographers\" covering the case had their media credentials removed after it emerged that they are actually federal agents. </p> <p>And Steve Judy, the town's mayor, cannot bear the image of Idaho as a playground for racists as well as the more innocent outdoor types drawn to its 18m acres of protected wilderness. \"Human rights groups outnumber hate groups here 10 to one,\" says the mayor. \"Richard Butler is not that big a deal. We're talking about nine people living there full-time. The biggest problem is the message of hate he sends out and the link to our region.\" </p> <p>It is true that until this point nothing has been pinned on Butler personally. But moonlighting Ayrans were among members of the Order, another far-right group, which murdered a Denver talk-show host and conducted a string of violent robberies in the 80s; members of the Aryan Republican Army, responsible for 22 bank raids 10 years later to finance a white revolution, were linked to Butler; and Bufford Furrow, who is accused of wounding three children and two adults at a Jewish community centre in Los Angeles last year before murdering a postman, is a former Aryan Nations security guard. </p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the court case, no matter the future for Butler, buffoon or soldier for a caucasian nirvana, Winkler the gardener is not going to go away. \"They can take our land, but they can't take Aryan Nations from our hearts.\"</p>",

  "<p>Not content with sending our convicts to Australia, we are now transporting our sitcom stars. For crimes unspecified, Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey were packed off to be <strong> Men Down Under</strong> (BBC1), and spent 50 minutes driving around the north-eastern corner of the continent in search of the legendary Australian male. They didn't find him. A show that set out to examine masculinity in its antipodean form came up with precious little material, and instead of insights or even discussions we were treated to an extended Clunes/Morrissey holiday video. This was not unpleasant. Clunes has that kind of easy, clubman's repartee that would make him the perfect travelling companion, while Morrissey seems to be the kind of lad who likes a drink or two. They got on well with the locals in such unpromising spots as Cairns and Alice Springs, and didn't try too hard to live up to their Men Behaving Badly personae. </p> <p>But after 30 minutes or so in which nothing had happened, the novelty was beginning to wear off. We saw Martin Clunes playing golf very badly for an agonising five minutes, while Morrissey visited a swimming pool that was hilariously closed. We saw some camels, and learned that they have smelly breath. We met a man who has made a lot of money from running a diving club, despite getting bad school reports. All of this could have been achieved a good deal closer to home. </p> <p>Clunes and Morrissey are lovely blokes and great actors, but without a script they don't make very exciting television. It's not enough simply to take a couple of familiar faces and send them somewhere hot - they have to be able to do something once they're there. Paul O'Grady's recent travels round the Far East worked because he was liable to blow a gasket at any moment - besides which, O'Grady is a great improvisational raconteur. Clunes and Morrissey aren't, and seemed for much of the time to be lost for words. They redeemed themselves in the show's final five minutes by getting slurringly drunk at a tent fight, during which we were treated to the edifying sight of two ageing tattooed men sitting on each other's faces. Were these the legendary \"real Australian men\" we'd been promised? Our hosts were too pissed to care. </p> <p>Much more exotic fare came in the final part of <strong> EastEnders</strong>' Spanish trilogy (BBC1). Walford's love-crossed seniors returned to Albert Square, but not before treating us to some of the best soap of the year. Pat and Frank's erotic reunion was interrupted by Irene, sending the two fun-sized lovers scrambling into their clothes in a muck sweat of guilt. So flustered was Pat that she lost one of her earrings, and spent the next few minutes looking strangely denuded with her unadorned lobe. The tell-tale trinket turned up on the back of Peggy's pashmina, whence it was retrieved by Frank in a fake embrace. The scene, like the whole episode, teetered just on the right side of farce, and never more so than when Frank attempted to follow Pat into an aeroplane toilet. \"Don't even think about it!\" said Pat, but not before we'd all had a vision of two very large people squeezed into a very small cubicle. </p> <p>Irene, of course, rode off into the sunset in a nifty red jeep, having chosen a life of economic uncertainty in Spain over domestic misery with Terry. \"Please, make a choice ...\" begged Terry, while the viewing nation bellowed \"Take the jeep!\" </p> <p>Ricky Tomlinson and Paterson Joseph made a promising double-act in <strong> Safe as Houses</strong> (ITV), a one-off drama that would be welcome back as a series. Tomlinson, his hair longer and more luxuriant than ever, was in muted mood as Lawrence, a former master butcher now ekeing out a living as a home security rep. Joseph was his odious boss Gabriel, a salesman who had fallen for his own patter and lost his wife as a result. Together they visited a series of unlucky householders - one of them Dora Bryan in the funniest cameo of the week - until they found themselves inexplicably bound and gagged at the mercy of a gun-wielding maniac. It was up to Tomlinson to talk his way out of that one, which he did, in an impressive set-piece that just proves that the art of TV-acting is alive and well and only waiting for some decent material.</p>",

A taxi driver described roadblocks at which UN soldiers sit in the shade while drunken or drugged young men wielding machetes and guns rob drivers and abuse civilians. </p> <p>\"If you see the West Side Boys at the checkpoint it is very bad news,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They just point their guns in your face and ask what you have in your pockets and the UN soldiers don't do anything. </p> <p>\"I don't think they could just kill you there, because that would be too much, but you know that if they want to kill you a mile down the road the UN won't do anything, because they are so friendly with these guys.\" </p> <p>The West Side Boys are what is known in Freetown as \"self-provisioning\". They are notorious for robbery, extortion, abduction and rape. They are believed to be holding several hundred civilians, some of them wealthy businessmen snatched from their cars on the main road into Freetown and held for ransom. </p> <p>Many women and girls are raped and held as sex slaves. </p> <p>Last month the UN sent Nigerian troops and Indian helicopter gunships to clear the West Side Boys from the road and press them to demobilise. Despite a heavy bombardment of the Occra Hills, where the renegades are camped, the abuses began again almost immediately. </p> <p>Some in the UN believe the West Side Boys were tipped off that the attack was coming and withdrew to a safe area. </p> <p>\"I do not think collaboration is too strong a word to describe what is happening,\" a UN official who regularly drives the road to visit refugees said. </p> <p>\"The Jordanians are feeding those guys and socialising with them without thinking that these are the same ones who are killing people and raping girls. Some of us have commented on this inside the UN and said we can't just have our soldiers stand by and let it happen, but we are told that we have to build confidence so [that] they give up their guns and join the demobilisation process.\" </p> <p>A UN spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Coker, declined to comment beyond saying: \"It's not true.\" </p> <p>The British have had close contact with the group in recent months. </p> <p>When the war flared up again in May, British officers were so desperate to find fighters to defend the government that the West Side Boys were supplied with large amounts of ammunition, and food and medicines. </p> <p>During a crucial battle at Rogberi Junction, a British lieutenant-colonel directed the West Side Boys attack on the rebels. </p> <p>But relations soured as the renegades showed little enthusiasm for putting themselves under the direct command of the government's new army. </p> <p>In June, West Side Boys fighters turned their guns on government troops during a battle for another town, Lunsar. The dispute was about rank: the renegades wanted to keep the grand ranks - they have a lot of \"brigadiers\" - they had awarded themselves in the bush. </p> <p>The hostility and suspicion grew when two of their leaders were arrested last month after a gun battle in Freetown over the ownership of a car which once belonged to the captured Revolutionary United Front leader, Foday Sankoh. </p> <p>A number of the West Side Boys have been accepted for training by the British as soldiers in Sierra Leone's new army, despite the gang's catalogue of human rights abuses. </p> <p>Before the war restarted, Britain had made plans for carefully screening recruits for the new force. </p> <p>With the upsurge in fighting, they felt it necessary to recruit any willing soldier, particularly those with experience, and that included many from groups such as the West Side Boys and the kamajor militias, as well as members of the former government army who were responsible for an array of atrocities, such as amputations and murdering children.</p>",
  "Eat your heart out, Winston Churchill. If only he had two internet sites, emails and computerised mailing when Britain faced its darkest hour. These are the latest hi-tech weapons being used at Pig Command - the Whitehall nickname for the Ministry of Agriculture's emergency control headquarters aimed at containing the swine fever that threatens pig exports. <p>Like the cabinet war rooms - visited by thousands of tourists - a war command has been set up in an unused Westminster basement near MI5 headquarters. </p> <p>Forty or so civil servants man a nerve centre overseeing life and death for some 12,000 pigs. The three room centre has three crisis desks; a kitchen cabinet table; a map room and an operations centre to check the disease has not spread. This is run by Gary, more usually overseeing the checking of passports for pets at Dover. But his reports will eventually lead to the all-clear to end the crisis. </p> <p>The map room contains large ordnance survey maps of East Anglia, with infected areas marked out. </p> <p>All that is missing is a bed so the cabinet minister in charge, Nick Brown, can sleep overnight if the crisis got out of hand. But so far this has proved unnecessary. Yesterday was the 19th consecutive day when no new outbreak had been confirmed. So far five outbreaks have been confirmed and 69 others checked out - with 44 cleared and restrictions lifted. </p> <p>The politically incorrect slogan on the board in Pig Command is \"Get 'em off\" - a phrase referring to the seven days it took to lift restrictions on farms outside the five original outbreak areas. </p> <p>The areas suffering the worst restrictions are in the constituencies of three Tory ex-agriculture ministers -Gillian Shephard; John Gummer and John Macgregor. </p> <p>The fourth area takes in the constituency of Tim Yeo, the shadow agricultural spokesman. </p> <p>Mr Brown - who with his department's chief veterinary officer and many of his civil servants cancelled their summer holidays at the last moment - is pleased that the issue has not become the main \"silly season\" story. \"By stamping on the problem at once we seem to have stopped it, touch wood, from spreading and turning it into a crisis. </p> <p>\"If someone had not taken charge Whitehall would not have known what to do and the whole thing - because it is highly infectious among pigs - could have spread everywhere.\" </p> <p>He said he had obtained millions of pounds of government cash - \u00a335 per infected pig and \u00a310 per piglet - to compensate farmers in the five infected areas from today.</p>",
  "Attendance at future Notting Hill carnivals on bank holiday Monday should be restricted to help prevent violence, police leaders suggested yesterday. <p>The Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said crime figures were played down for political reasons, and that attendance should be cut by a third from the notional 1m total this year. </p> <p>It said officers were forced to turn a blind eye to crime because they were afraid of provoking violence. </p> <p>Two men were murdered this year in separate incidents. Police estimate 1m people crammed the streets of the west London district on Monday, traditionally the busier of the two days. </p> <p>Glen Smyth, chairman of the federation, said: \"For a number of years, the level of reported crime is far below that which really happens. </p> <p>\"There is a significant criminal minority who exploit it in full knowledge that the police will tread extremely lightly.\" </p> <p>The vice-chairman, Dave Rodgers, suggested that barriers be put round the route to regulate the number of visitors. </p> <p>The Notting Hill Carnival Trust, which organises the parade, said: \"Realistically, there is no way of stopping people coming to Notting Hill for the carnival. The carnival is run on public roads and people have a right of way.\" </p>",
  "Indonesia's attempt to try its former dictator Suharto for corruption stumbled at the first hurdle yesterday when, as expected, the man who ruled the country for 32 years failed to appear for the opening hearing, citing poor health. <p>The millions of Indonesians who stopped work to watch the televised humiliation of the man whose authoritarian regime imprisoned tens of thousands of people without trial will now have to wait until September 14 for the second episode of the drama. </p> <p>In an otherwise crowded courtroom, the high-backed, wooden defendant's seat was conspicuously empty when the presiding judge, Lalu Mariyun, banged his gavel to open the proceedings. </p> <p>Mr Suharto is accused of stealing about \u00a3385m while in power. </p> <p>An hour of legal argument followed as Mr Suharto's team of eight lawyers catalogued the litany of ailments their client's 23 doctors say he is suffering from, and which prevent him from fully understanding the charges against him. </p> <p>They claimed that Mr Suharto, 79, has suffered three strokes in the past two years, and that there was a high risk of further strokes. They also claimed he had dementia, diabetes, loss of memory, impaired speech, brain damage, dangerously high blood pressure and an inability to concentrate, among other illnesses. </p> <p>\"He can only understand and express opinions on simple matters. For complex ones, he needs help, and the quality of his answers cannot be fully guaranteed,\" said Mohammed Assegaf, one of the former general's defence lawyers. </p> <p>Prosecutors immediately demanded a further examination by a team of independent doctors. But the five judges decided that the doctors for the defence should first explain, \"in simple language that can be understood by both us, the judges, and the general public\", the details of Mr Suharto's condition, according to Judge Mariyun. </p> <p>He gave the defence team two weeks to prepare the doctors' testimony, a clear sign that the pretrial wrangling is likely to be extremely protracted and that Mr Suharto, who faces life imprisonment if convicted, is unlikely to appear in court for weeks, if not months. </p> <p>The defence lawyers were outraged that neither the judges nor the prosecution believed the medical reports. </p> <p>\"All doctors are independent,\" said lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon after the hearing. \"How can they doubt our doctors? All doctors have to swear an ethical oath and Mr Suharto's [doctor's] are no different.\" </p> <p>During the past seven months, government doctors continually insisted that Mr Suharto was fit enough to stand trial, while Mr Suharto's doctors countered with the poor-health card. </p> <p>It is unclear whether Mr Suharto can be tried in absentia. Under Indonesian law, the defendant has to attend the first trial session to respond to the charges. </p> <p>However, there are ongoing discussions that, when concluded, may allow the supreme court to pass a decree for the trial to proceed without Mr Suharto. </p> <p>While it is Mr Suharto that is meant to be in the dock, it is not just the former strongman who is on trial in the specially constructed courtroom in an agriculture ministry auditorium next to the Jakarta zoo. </p> <p>The credibility of the Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, his administration, and his commitment to reform are equally under the spotlight. </p> <p>Since coming to power last October, Mr Wahid has been under enormous pressure to prosecute Mr Suharto; students have demonstrated almost daily in Jakarta, demanding a speedy trial and conviction. </p> <p>Hundreds protested in front of the court yesterday, shouting: \"Hang Suharto!\" and \"Don't believe Suharto's lies!\" </p> <p>\"Everyone knows he's guilty of so many crimes, so the government has no excuse for not prosecuting him regardless,\" said Sudianto, a member of the militant City Forum student movement. </p> <p>But the attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, insists that it has not been easy to build a credible case. </p> <p>\"Mr Suharto did not leave any smoking guns lying around,\" he said. \"It has been a long, tough investigation just to get this far.\" </p> <p>That is why Mr Suharto is \"only\" being charged with embezzling about \u00a3385m through seven of the charitable foundations he ran while president, even though he is thought to have siphoned off about \u00a330bn. </p> <p>The 3,000-page prosecution dossier also alleges that Mr Suharto passed several decrees, such as diverting 2% of income tax receipts to the foundations, to enrich himself and his family. </p> <p>There is also no mention in this round of charges of the more widespread corruption, crimes against humanity or abuse of power for which Indonesians want him tried. </p> <p>The end result, according to many observers, particularly as Mr Wahid has promised to pardon Mr Suharto if he is convicted, is that the trial is little more than a charade. </p> <p>\"Gus Dur [Mr Wahid's nickname] is delivering what he thinks the people want, but more importantly, what he needs to give them to survive\" said Teten Marzuki of Indonesia Corruption Watch. \"We're unlikely ever to see either any of Suharto's billions returned to the state or him being prosecuted for more serious crimes. As far as he and Suharto are concerned, it's a win-win situation.\"</p>",
  "One of Turkey's most popular religious leaders, Fethullah Gulen, was charged yesterday with trying to undermine the secular system and set up an Islamic dictatorship. <p>Mr Gulen, who has hundreds of thousands of supporters, could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if he is convicted. </p> <p>The indictment against Mr Gulen alleges that he is the \"strongest and most effective Islamic fundamentalist in Turkey\" who \"camouflages his methods with a democratic and moderate image\". </p> <p>Mr Gulen is currently in the United States for lengthy medical treatment, and will probably be tried in absentia. </p> <p>The judicial move against such a prominent figure marks the beginning of a new phase in the Turkish establishment's long battle against what it regards as dangerous religious extremism. The charges were announced just a few hours after the head of the armed forces delivered a stern warning about the threat posed by \"radical Islam\", those Muslims who want to politicise the Islamic faith. </p> <p>Speaking late on Wednesday night, the army chief of staff General Huseyin Kivrikoglu said that thousands of civil servants - some of them in senior positions - are trying to destroy the secular system. </p> <p>\"They are working against the state every day in order to overthrow it,\" he said. \"They have spread everywhere.\" </p> <p>The military has been leading a campaign against a political Islam since 1997, when it helped bring down Turkey's first Islamist-led government. Mr Gulen has become one of its highest profile targets. </p> <p>A judicial investigation against him was launched last year after the release of video tapes in which Mr Gulen allegedly urged his supporters in the state bureaucracy to lie low and wait for his orders to undermine the system. </p> <p>Mr Gulen has denied the charges against him, and said the tapes were a forgery. He portrays himself as a voice of tolerance, and he is widely admired and trusted by Turks. </p> <p>He is the most influential leader of the Nur, or Holy Light, sect, which was founded by Said-i Nursi, who died in 1960 and was regarded by his followers as a messenger from God. Religious sects - tarikats - are illegal in Turkey, but they still flourish and have considerable influence. </p> <p>Even politicians who rail against the Islamic threat are known to court the tarikats, because of the weight they carry during elections. The prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, who has made his reputation as a staunch secularist, is one of Mr Gulen's many fans. </p> <p>In particular, Mr Ecevit has spoken of his admiration for the network of schools and colleges that Mr Gulen has established across Turkey, the Middle East and much of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p>However, the indictment issued yesterday insisted that the schools are a front for a much more sinister plan. </p> <p>\"Mr Gulen was planning to use the young people whom he brainwashed at his own schools to set up his Islamic state,\" the indictment said. </p> <p>The case could split Turkish society. Some will regard the allegations as the fruits of secularist paranoia, while others will insist the threat is real and immediate. </p> <p>Gen Kivrikoglu has insisted that the government pass legislation as soon as possible which would allow the authorities to dismiss civil servants from their posts if they are suspected of supporting radical Islam. </p> <p>Opinion polls consistently suggest that the majority of Turks support a clear division between religion and politics. But a crackdown on the tarikats would pit parts of the Turkish establishment against powerful forces which are deeply embedded in society. </p> <p>Since modern Turkey was founded 77 years ago, it has struggled to resolve the question of how a robustly secular state can best manage the affairs of a deeply religious and conservative country.</p>",
  "<p><strong> A Clockwork Orange</strong> <br>Rental <br>Warner Cert 18 <br>****</p> <p>Made in 1971 and banned in the UK from 1974, Stanley Kubrick's film put Anthony Burgess's short, sharp shock of a book on screen with great veracity. Burgess's chronology and much of his dialogue survive intact, complete with the author's memorable invented teen slang, making Kubrick's sole screenplay credit a bit cheeky.</p> <p>It is the director's most English film (and just about the only time he didn't have to invent a fake foreign country) and has been hugely influential ever since. At least two rock bands got their names from here - Heaven 17 and Moloko - and countless others ripped off its look and style.</p> <p>Many will have seen it in bootleg versions or, like me, in 80s Amsterdam, where it fitted neatly with all those other things the Dutch tolerated and the British didn't. Burgess wrote it in 1962, but by the time of Kubrick's film, football hooliganism echoed the film's gangs.</p> <p>McDowell's performance as Alex still looks his best ever, a slyer version of his anti-establishment public schoolboy in If... (while a dream sequence with grapes and topless women comically foreshadows his future decline in Caligula). But the big surprise seeing it again is how much like a pantomime the film is. Kubrick's upper classes are as parodied as any Mike Leigh film, the decor in Alex's parents' house is as garish as an early Almodovar, and a speeded-up orgy scene plays shockingly like the Confessions Of series.</p> <p>Perhaps this is a deliberate attempt to distract from the violence, but the effect is to lighten the evil of the vicious young hoodlum, who must be \"transformed out of all recognition\" as he becomes a guinea pig for governmental experiments. A landmark film, if not quite the work of genius Kubrick fans proclaim. Then again, it could have been worse: it nearly became a Ken Russell film.</p> <p><strong> L'Ennui</strong> <br>Rental and retail (\u00a315.99) <br>Artificial Eye Cert 18 <br>***</p> <p>A French film as determinedly jittery as its lead character, an obsessive, humourless philosophy professor played by Charles Berling. Berling saves a painter from a beating, for which he is given a painting. Shortly afterwards the painter dies having sex with his young model (Sophie Guillemin). A relationship develops in which Berling becomes increasingly manic, intense and unhinged. The affair becomes a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois but unlike that other Parisian threesome in Last Tango, we never meet its third member. Guillemin's other boyfriend remains a cypher nagging at the fevered mind of Berling.</p> <p>The actor, whose best-known role here was in the lead in Patrice Leconte's excellent Ridicule, gives a memorable performance and his contrast to the placid Guillemin is total. Ultimately, L'Ennui is a bit like living through somebody else's nervous breakdown. C\u00e9dric Kahn's pacy direction never lets up for a minute - the film is as driven as its anti-hero and will leave you feeling all shook up for some time afterwards.</p> <p><strong> Body Shots</strong> <br>Rental <br>Entertainment in Video Cert 18 <br>**</p> <p>A night out ends in sex for Jerry O'Connell and Tara Reid. She says it's rape. He says not. Body Shots is about being in control and losing control.

Director Michael Cristofer punctuates his plot with its eight main characters' verbally frank, contentious and aggressive opinions on sex. They're an egocentric bunch with 80s yuppie aspirational attitudes and hard to like. Body Shots intends to be serious but can't help feeling exploitative.</p>",
  "<p>How did Baltimore get so lucky? Most mid-sized American regional cities are lucky to have even one film-maker associated with them, if any. Pittsburgh, for example, has Night of the Living Dead director George Romero as its own municipal zombie-wrangler, and Austin has Richard Linklater. But cities like Cleveland, Philadelphia, or Columbus, Ohio? Films get made there once in a blue moon, but not by anyone who's ever lived there or knows them inside-out. </p> <p>Somehow Baltimore has produced not one but two cinematic civic laureates to hymn its faded urban glories: John Waters has made a career out of his distinctively Baltimore-based sensibility, drawing creative (and destructive) succour from its uptight white suburbs, its hillbilly trailer parks and its lively black districts. </p> <p>Then there's Barry Levinson, better known for huge hits like Rain Man and Good Morning, Vietnam, and for studio star vehicles like Disclosure and Sphere. But to those who have followed his career since his directorial debut Diner in 1982, he's the quintessential Baltimore filmmaker. Between his big studio hits - and sometimes directly because of them - he has made three further movies based on his rich reservoir of memories of his hometown. </p> <p>Tin Men, from 1988, was a manic comedy set in 1963 about competition, war, sexual jealousy and salesmanship among men about 15 years older than the adolescents in Diner. Avalon, made as a reward after the worldwide success of Rain Man, is a symphonic, rhythmical family drama that adheres to John Gregory Dunne's narrative prescription for the 20th-century American immigrant experience - \"from steerage to suburbia in three generations\" - and details the impact of television on its extended Jewish family. It feels like a languorous, contented version of Terence Davies' Distant Voices, Still Lives. Now, 10 years later, Levinson has again returned to Baltimore with Liberty Heights. </p> <p>\"I never thought of them as a quartet till now,\" says Levinson over an outdoor breakfast at a starchy Beverly Hills hotel. \"And it really wasn't planned that way. I always thought I was lucky just to get one made. But periodically you go back and it gives you a chance to re-evaluate, make sense out of things in your life, things going on in the country, and in the specific place in which you grew up. For me that's an interesting dynamic.\" </p> <p>Liberty Heights expands on the issues of being both Jewish and American that were hinted at in Avalon. It's a loving, complex portrait of a time and a place, enriched by detailed personal experience and peppered both with tragedy and Levinson's warm and absurd sense of humour.</p> <p>It most closely resembles Diner - indeed the high school kids in it will grow up to be the diner guys - but also shows how much Levinson's writing has matured in the last 20 years. Diner was about the indistinct borderlands between adolescence and adulthood and between freedom and responsibility. Liberty Heights, named for a Jewish district of the city, is about many lines, most of them very sharply delineated: between Jews and goyim in general, between Jews and blacks and rich WASPs in particular, between criminality and the law, and between immigrant parents and their assimilated children.</p> <p>It's appropriate that all these dividing lines should run through Baltimore; after all, the Mason-Dixon line bisects Maryland across the middle, and the state, half Union, half Confederate during the civil war, remains an intriguing hybrid of northern seaport and sleepy, humid southern industrial city with a black majority population. </p> <p>Like the other Baltimore movies, Liberty Heights takes place at a specific cultural and political moment, in this case between the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court decision that desegregated America's state schools in mid-1954, and the rise of rock'n'roll in the next 12 months, aided by a similar, more gradual desegregation of the white-dominated airwaves. </p> <p>Diner is set in the last week of the 1950s, as the stormclouds gather. Tin Men takes place in the summer before the Kennedy assassination, but never mentions it. What symbolises change at the movie's end is the heartbreaking news that this year's Cadillac will be the last one with fins. (The 1955 Cadillac Coupe de Ville is a totemic fetish-object for Levinson - Tin Men's credits are written in Cadillac chrome lettering as the camera caresses the car's smooth curves and creamy paintwork, and in Liberty Heights Mantegna sneaks out of the Rosh Hashanah service to go view \"the new Caddies\".) Avalon, in Levinson's eyes, is less about the immigrant experience than it is about the TV as destructive symbol of American values. </p> <p>Television looms large in Levinson's life, what with his dad being a TV salesman, and his own decision after graduating high school in 1960 to study broadcast journalism whilst working in a local TV station. He worked in England as a writer for The Marty Feldman Show. \"I lived all over for short periods of time,\" he recalls, as he tries to reel forgotten phrases like \"High Barnet\" and \"St Albans\" up out of a 35-year-deep hole of memories. \"I was so fascinated by the day-to-day goings-on in these odd little places that I didn't want to just stay in London.\" </p> <p>He arrived in Los Angeles in 1967. \"LA was much more laid back then than it is now, even if the 1960s did feel like some huge national costume party.\" He wrote comedy for Alan King and Tim Conway before netting a job on The Carol Burnett Show. This earned him what he laughingly calls \"respectability in the business\", and in the early 70s he began what he calls \"a great apprenticeship in the movies\" with comedian Mel Brooks. He was one of the writers on Brooks's Silent Movie and his Hitchcock spoof High Anxiety, in which he also played the maniacal bellboy in the shower scene (\"Here's your NEWS-PAPER!!\"). </p> <p>\"We met every day for three years for breakfast and we'd write all day, over lunch and into the evening.\" Brooks had been a pioneer member of the legendary TV writing team for Your Show of Shows Starring Sid Caesar (a 15-year-old Woody Allen got his start there in 1951 as a gag-man) and Levinson remembers, \"we were sort of the next generation, I suppose, so I heard all their great stories about those days.\" </p> <p>By the beginning of the 80s, Levinson had found his style and was working up his own material, much of it autobiographical and written with his then-wife, Valerie Curtin. He did uncredited rewrites on Tootsie (later he enriched 48 Hrs by adding the famous scene in which Eddie Murphy tells a barful of rednecks \"I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare - a nigger with a badge!\"), and sold Best Friends, based on his relationship with Curtin, which was made starring Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn, and the legal black comedy ...And Justice For All. </p> <p>\"Best Friends became a much more Hollywood kind of movie as it got made,\" says Levinson but ...And Justice For All (which he co-wrote with Curtin) is all about Baltimore. It was made up of stories I'd heard from friends of mine at the diner who'd grown up to be lawyers - stories of the insanity of the system and how fucked up it was on so many different levels. If it had happened later it could easily have become one of my Baltimore movies.\" </p> <p>Instead that first Baltimore movie ended up being Diner which, despite a brainless Variety review that called it \"dark, depressing and inaccessible\" was a huge hit and an indisputable classic, one of the best coming-of-age comedies ever made. With the other three films - and to a lesser extent with associated projects like ...And Justice, the TV series Homicide (made by Levinson's influential production company Baltimore Pictures) and his unreleased documentary Diner Guys, about his old Baltimore friends - Levinson has created a gigantic tapestry of lower-middle class life in the middle of the American century.</p> <p>A thread from one will turn up in another, like the Fells Point Diner itself, which appears in all four, or the 1950 Hornet that Van drives in Liberty Heights, which Mickey Rourke seems to own by 1959 in Diner. At the end of that film, Rourke plans to join Michael Tucker in the \"home-improvement business\" and Tucker, still playing Bagel, still in the HI biz, turns up as Richard Dreyfuss's boss in Tin Men.</p> <p>The connections are deepened by the repetition of Levinson's signature obsessions: R&amp;B music versus the religious significance of Frank Sinatra; purebred WASP princesses riding thoroughbred black horses as stricken, lovelorn Jewish boys look on in tremulous ecstasy, guys singing along to the car radio, endless ridiculous arguments about Bonanza!; nights in jail; and suburbia versus the old neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"I wrote Tin Men in three weeks,\" says Levinson. \"And Avalon and Diner. All in three weeks. And they never get rewritten because I don't know how to rewrite them. Sometimes I don't think of myself as a writer when it comes to the Baltimore pieces, because I don't feel so involved with 'writing'. It's more like dictation - the scenes just pour out, I write them down.\" </p> <p>Let's just hope Levinson doesn't wait another 10 years before his next three weeks.</p> <p>\u0095 The Guardian Interview with Barry Levinson is on September 7 at the NFT in London (tickets: 020 7928 3232). Liberty Heights is released on September 8.</p>",
  "<p>I lived in Medellin from May to December 1999, while we prepared and filmed Our Lady of the Assassins, based on the book by Fernando Vallejo. It is the story of a man who returns to the Colombian city after several years to find it has been taken over by young contract killers, or sicarios, hired by the drug traffickers. </p> <p>Medellin is the city of eternal spring, the city where the kindness and courtesy of another time - that of my childhood in Colombia - lives on to this day. It's also a city obsessed with order and cleanliness, a city full of energy and happiness. There is of course another facet to it which can be summed up in figures: 5,000 documented armed gangs; 95% of crimes go unpunished; 15 deaths per day, 30 on weekends and holidays. </p> <p>Everything is played out in the poor neighbourhoods, or communes. The police only enter in case of dire necessity, and then in droves. The paramilitary and the guerrillas dispute areas of influence by creating or taking control of certain gangs. </p> <p>I've collected here in chronological order some emails - quick snapshots - I sent once or twice a week to Vallejo and some friends during this time. </p> <p> <strong> Hold-up</strong> </p> <p> Our very first scouting. I'm filming the house where Vallejo was born with a small digital camera when I hear yells behind me. It's my Colombian friend Eduardo, screaming out a slew of insults: \"Motherfucker! Gonorrhea!\" etc. He runs and stops in the middle of the street pretending to load his cellular phone as if it were a black gun.</p> <p>A young, well-dressed man has just walked up to Eduardo and tried to grab his mobile phone out of his back pocket. Eduardo has ripped the phone out of his assailant's hands and is now pretending it is a gun.</p> <p>The young man takes a few steps toward me, puts his right arm behind his back. He wants the camera. Holding the camera with my arms outstretched, I tell him to come and get it. He thinks it over, turns around and leaves. The thing is, I didn't see the young man's gun - a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. He must have thought he was dealing with two dangerous lunatics, and that it was too risky. </p> <p>But he didn't depart empty-handed - he'd still had enough time to steal our driver's gold chain while threatening her with the gun and telling her \"todo bien\" - that everything was going to be all right. </p> <p> <strong> The mayor</strong> </p> <p>Today I met the mayor of Medellin. He's very worried about a new armed gang made up of FARC dissidents operating in the Pilarica neighbourhood and headed by a female doctor who is apparently out of control and very bloodthirsty. Four policemen were seriously wounded last night by her gang. </p> <p>While we were in his office, he found out that one policeman had died. A little later another phonecall: a commando unit of 17 members of the Las Terrazas gang has burst into the San Jose hospital to free a terrorist and a very dangerous assassin who had been injured and brought there from the high-security prison. Last Sunday, on Father's Day, there were 34 deaths. </p> <p>The casting's going very well - in just a few weeks we have already found two possible boys. These 15-year-old criminals' vitality and angelic good looks, the very studied elegance of their clothes and their way of considering their short lives like those of butterflies, are irresistible. The survivors - the ones that talk like retirees - are 21 years old. </p> <p> <strong> Another corpse</strong> </p> <p>Last night I saw one before dinner; today before lunch. At noon I was walking, as I do every day, with my friend Eduardo to eat five minutes from here. At a red light Eduardo recognised the driver and van that picks up bodies. Sure enough, not too far away, there was a very young man on the ground surrounded by curious onlookers and policemen. </p> <p>When I get back, less than half an hour later, I again think it was all a dream: no trace of blood and children are playing right where the body had been. </p> <p> <strong> Manrique</strong> </p> <p>Two scenes in the movie take place in Manrique, a neighbourhood that, because of the Las Terrazas gang, has become one of the city's most dangerous. A friend of mine, Papa Giovanni, has organised protection for us so we can scout the neighbourhood but I immediately realise that even he is ill at ease.</p> <p>He introduces us to a 22-year-old gang boss, a survivor, slightly fat, crew cut, blue, unblinking eyes. He's got a strategy to never, ever look anyone in the eye. Very, very calm, his gestures measured. You get the chilling feeling that he is staring at piles of corpses behind the person he is speaking to. He never smiles.</p> <p>Even Eduardo, who's very funny and used to this kind of character, can't make him laugh. There's another guy who laughs nervously all the time - the gang leader's sicario. In veiled terms, always laughing, he brags about being bad, something about a chainsaw. We wish we'd never met them, and want them to forget they ever knew us. </p> <p>We go all over the neighbourhood. I discover another side to the gangster's personality: he tries to pick up all the girls by giving them orders: \"You, come over here!\" Sometimes the killer joins in. The girls, even very young ones, already know it's very dangerous to react in the slightest way, and keep walking. We won't set foot in Manrique again and we won't ever ask Papa Giovanni to show us around another neighbourhood that isn't his. </p> <p> <strong> Anderson</strong> </p> <p>That's it, I finally met Anderson [the actor who will play Alexis]. I'd seen a video of him and sent everyone looking for him through the city for the last 15 days. He is absolutely extraordinary. Ambiguous, angel and devil, very charismatic - a 16-year-old, streetwise, Montgomery Clift type. His acting needs some work but he's bright and the camera loves him. He lives with his 13-year-old brother in a commune very high up in the hills controlled by the militia tied to the guerrillas. </p> <p>We try to put him up in town but he doesn't want to move because his mother, who's in prison, calls him at a phone up there. He sells incense on the street and has just finished a three-month jail sentence for burglary. Last night, with three friends, he assaulted a passerby, they split the equivalent of $50. A little later the police stopped them after they'd already spent the money and made them give their victim their shoes. He had to go home barefoot: a two-hour climb. Tomorrow I'm taking him to see a doctor and we'll look for an apartment for him near his little brother's school. </p> <p><strong> The Frenchman flees in panic</strong> </p> <p>A hard blow today. It certainly won't be the last and I can't help but laugh about it. My production manager, who had left for Paris for a few days, has just pulled out; he doesn't want to come back as planned, he was too scared here and didn't dare tell me. He gave me the key to his locker when he left. I've just opened it. It was practically empty, so his treason was premeditated! From now on, I will be the only foreigner on the crew. </p> <p> <strong> Todo bien</strong> </p> <p>Two serious problems the day before yesterday. We lost the most important, irreplaceable location - the apartment the film takes place in - and two bikers caught up to our driver and threw a crumpled paper ball into the car, a note that read: \"LOS PP'S QUEREMOS AL MONO TODO BIEN\" (the PPs want the foreigner, everything's all right). </p> <p>In Colombia receiving a note like this is often a death sentence. Now the paranoid atmosphere we are working in is assured. On the bright side, we think it's from a gang who are into extortion and not kidnapping. The dark side: it's only the beginning, something else could follow, like someone firing shots at the car or the house. </p> <p>Today we had a meeting with one of the country's top \"security analysts\" who suspects our chauffeur. We are waiting for the results of the graphology [writing samples] tests. Anyway, without telling the security specialist (you really can't trust anyone), we have established discreet contact with the police chief.</p> <p>Starting tomorrow, he is lending us two cops dressed as civilians, armed to the teeth, who will follow me in their car as soon as I leave my new home, which will be a true fortress. Officially I will keep living at the same address. I will never travel twice in a row in the same car, my drivers will also be security guards. On location, starting tomorrow, there will always be an armoured car ready to take me away! </p> <p>The actors' reading went fabulously well. The script is perfect and so are the actors. I am a happy man for the moment; now we just have to make the movie come to life. </p> <p> <strong> Bodyguards</strong> </p> <p>I don't enjoy my new life with bodyguards but I maintain my perspective on things; it seems I'm a \"level-seven risk\" (on a scale of 10). In any case it certainly impresses my young actor Anderson, who spends his days and part of his nights with me. </p> <p>My bodyguards are two young policemen, no more than 24 years old. I am in permanent radio contact with them by means of a little black object which is a combination cellular phone, beeper and radio. If someone suspicious approaches and speaks to me I only have to press a little button and the whole security corps listens in on our conversation. They both carry guns, mini-Uzis and sawn-off hunting rifles. </p> <p>The first, Raul, is short, dark-skinned and fat, and the other, Leonardo, is skinny, blond and good-looking. Leonardo has decided to become my friend and he's very forward. The day before yesterday he asked me if I like Antioquian food. I said yes. He then asked me if I wanted to have lunch at his place the following day. He insists I go alone which has made me experience a horrible inner conflict and led me to think about it in four differing ways: </p> <p>1. It's a trap - every kidnapping story involves a cop. </p> <p>2. I have to go - it's the least I can do for someone I make follow my rhythm of no more than six hours' sleep per day. </p> <p>3. I have no reason to feel obligated - he's the one who's exaggerating by putting me in this situation. </p> <p>4. I'm naturally curious. </p> <p>Number four eventually won out. A family atmosphere with a dash of paramilitarism. At least five statues of the Virgin. I now know all the technical details about the manufacture of home-made guerrilla bombs. </p> <p> <strong> Young actors </strong> </p> <p>Anderson hadn't told us about his recent problems with the law: he's wanted for kidnapping and armed assault! We try to soften up the judge. In one case, they'd taken a cab driver hostage but the taxi had an alarm system that paralysed the vehicle after 15 minutes. Anderson and his friends found themselves in the open countryside in the middle of the night with a mob of taxi drivers who were about to lynch them; they were saved by the police, who then filed charges against them. </p> <p>Juan David, who plays the character Wilmar, is also in trouble. He lives in the Bello commune and he's on a list, made by a group interested in \"social cleansing\", of people to be executed. He should move today to an apartment we found him right next to ours. The day before yesterday, a rainy night, none of the members of his gang were on guard, watching out for the neighbouring enemy gang who took advantage of the situation and sneaked into his best friend's house and killed him. Since his mother stood up to them, they killed her too. </p> <p>Last night Juan David was faced with the following dilemma: avenge his best friend's mother's murder or refuse to take part in the retaliatory expedition and thus put his own life in danger. I tried to explain to him that the mother's death wasn't the worst thing that could have happened and that in fact she had averted years of terrible misery. He seemed convinced when he left. </p> <p>When he got back for the make-up test this morning I found out his best friend's mother's murderer had been killed last night. </p> <p> <strong> Execution</strong> </p> <p>Papa Giovanni helps us enter the Diamante commune. Yesterday, just after we parted company, he was having a beer with his friend Olman, who was going to play a part in the film. A man slowly passed behind Olman and shot him in the head. He left just as slowly. The bullet, which could also have wounded Giovanni, didn't exit but it created a lump on Olman's forehead before he dropped dead on to the table. </p> <p>Giovanni is deeply grief-stricken; he can't get over it. </p> <p><strong> Disposables </strong> </p> <p>An incredible scene last night in the church of San Antonio; we had 50 basuqueros come in, the local equivalent - but much worse - of crackheads. Some people here call them desechables or disposables, individuals you can throw away or kill. They're wild-eyed and uncontrollable, talking and playing non-stop like small children. They sort of took over and we adjusted. </p> <p>Before the shoot, the wardrobe manager was taking pictures for continuity. One of the basuqueros appointed himself as their spokesman to tell me that they were scared, that they thought we were drawing up lists to have them killed. </p> <p><strong> Anderson's dark past</strong> </p> <p> Every day we find out something else about Anderson and it isn't him who tells us. There are people who have \"debts to settle\" (culebras) with him, in particular a serious affair with coke dealers from Manrique. They are suspected of having wanted to kill Anderson last night when they shot three of his best friends at the spot under the subway where he meets them every night - one dead and two injured. Luckily he wasn't there, we were shooting that night. Before he started spending time with us he kept very nasty company. </p> <p>There are also some policemen who know him very well and are just waiting to run into him alone at night to get rid of him. This is what they told Eduardo last week when they arrested Anderson in the street, handcuffed him and started beating him near Bolivar park. It happened around lunchtime, during the filming. Luckily Eduardo was able to radio the bodyguards and put an end to the incident. </p> <p><strong> Real weapons, better acting</strong> </p> <p>After using very well-made copies, I found out that using real guns put my young actors into a trance. Their eyes shine, they're much more concentrated and play their role much more seriously. This of course complicates the security issue but in some cases it's worth it. I sometimes even go so far as to let them carry guns though they're not used in the scene. </p> <p><strong> Accountant assaulted</strong> </p> <p>Yesterday our accountant was assaulted on his return from the bank with an envelope full of cash. Two gun-slinging youngsters on a motorbike followed him from the bank and asked him to hand over the envelope. The accountant hesitated until they asked him if he wanted to die. It lasted all of two seconds in front of a dozen witnesses. They would've shot him without any hesitation - it's one of their rules of conduct to maintain the level of danger and terror. </p> <p><strong> Gunshots on La Playa</strong> </p> <p>Looking for peace and quiet, we film violent street scenes as a rule very early on Sunday mornings. I always try to avoid firing blanks in scenes so we don't traumatise the population who already hear enough gunshots every day. </p> <p>Sometimes, though, it's impossible to get good reactions from the extras without firing blanks. Such is the case for three shots that day. Soon after the first gunshots are fired, I see several people all dressed in white walking down La Playa Avenue where we're filming. I immediately know they're not extras. I've banned two colours in the film: white for technical videotaping reasons, and orange for aesthetic ones. We finally figure out who they are: they're peace marchers.Today, for the first time, in every city in the country, crowds of millions of people in white are demonstrating that they're sick and tired of violence. A memorable date. </p> <p>When I was a child here it was also a matter of colours: the \"blues\" and the \"reds\" were killing each other by the thousands. We had to twist my parrot's neck since it kept repeating: \"I'm dressed in green but I'm a liberal\" (red). We couldn't give him away or let him loose: he might have caused a massacre in any house he landed in. </p> <p><strong> A new strategy</strong> </p> <p>I found out last night from a police source that the guerrillas have just put out a call for hostages in the criminal underground - they'll pay $1,000 cash for any foreigner. My bodyguards are very nervous. </p> <p>The guerrillas are among us, in the city, and they're given a monthly salary. They steal vehicles, put on uniforms at the last minute, raise blockades, capture the hostages that interest them after having stripped the others of any valuables. One thing is certain: taking into account the fact that, on every front, things are getting inexorably worse, this film could not have been made here a year from now. Unless there were a miracle, and peace took hold overnight. Nobody believes that will happen. Anyone who can is thinking of settling abroad. </p> <p><strong> The fake Aiwa</strong> </p> <p>We needed props, copies we could damage, an Aiwa sound-system to throw out the window. It turns out it's three times cheaper to buy a real Aiwa sound-system than to have a fake one made. Money laundering. A contraband Mont Blanc pen costs $90 on the black market. The factory, the Mont Blanc headquarters, sold the same pen for $120. Money laundering. Another money-laundering scheme. </p> <p><strong> A formula for filming downtown</strong> </p> <p>First, organise a fake set with cameras, projectors and a hysterical director. Comedy mixed with violence is a true crowd-pleaser. Then, very discreetly, film the real thing 50m away. </p> <p>Second, coach a dozen extras to approach people who might notice what you're doing during the takes. Have the extras ask them for the time or tell them to move along. The hapless souls who refuse to move are immediately assaulted by our special task force: a group of frightening, stinking beggars who stick to them like glue and hound them for money until they leave. </p> <p>This system works wonders. </p> <p><strong> Last day of shooting</strong> </p> <p>We were supposed to start at 10am on a set built in a warehouse. The entrance hall of the morgue. Nothing was ready: a door and some fluorescent lights are missing. We wait around all day, and finally, at 6pm, the door arrives. It's too big. We end up filming at 9pm with no fluorescent lights, only the regular film lights, a single very complex shot. We luckily never ran across these kinds of problems during the rest of the shoot. We just had to end it all on a slightly Colombian note. Overall, the crew I had the chance to work with were well up to international standards. </p> <p>Emotions ran high when the champagne began to flow. Things that had been left unsaid during the shoot came out into the open. Everyone thought I was crazy to have tried to make this film. Now they would have to return to the hard reality of a country on the brink of disaster without ever being able to forget these past seven weeks. Neither will I. I don't think I will ever again take part in such an emotionally charged and dramatic shoot. </p> <p>Driving home at 2am on the deserted highway I hear three gunshots at the back of the vehicle: one of my giddy bodyguards is firing into the air. Later he will try to justify this by saying that a large car with six shady guys approached us at high speed and that he chased them away by firing. Eduardo is certain he didn't see a car. We'll never know. A typically Colombian experience: to become less and less sure how real what you see and hear is. </p> <p>\u0095 Barbet Schroeder's Our Lady of the Assassins receives its world premiere at the Venice film festival next Wednesday.</p>"
