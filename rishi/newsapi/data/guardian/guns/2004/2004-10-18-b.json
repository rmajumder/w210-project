  "<p>Patrick Vieira will miss Arsenal's Champions League match against Panathinaikos tomorrow and is a major doubt for the meeting with Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. </p> <p>The captain sprained an ankle when fouled by Aston Villa's Jlloyd Samuel during Arsenal's 3-1 win at Highbury on Saturday and his manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said: \"I think there's a big problem after the way I've seen him limping.\" </p> <p>Vieira, who was treated at the club's London Colney training centre yesterday, badly wants to be fit to face United in what has become a crucial game for Sir Alex Ferguson's team, who are now 11 points behind Wenger's leaders. </p> <p>Vieira's absence gives the Brazilian Edu the opportunity to show he is worth a new contract, which he has so far failed to negotiate with Arsenal. With Gilberto Silva recovering from a back injury and Dennis Bergkamp missing the match against the Greeks because of his unwillingness to travel by air, Wenger's options are limited. </p> <p>Freddie Ljungberg is set to return after missing Saturday's game because of a hamstring problem and it looks likely Edu will be paired with the teenager Cesc F\u00e1bregas in central midfield, with Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes moved forward as the support striker to Thierry Henry. </p> <p>Fulham have been fined \u00a37,500 by the Football Association for failing to control their players in the recent fracas against West Bromwich Albion. The striker Andy Cole was sent off for lashing out at the Albion defender Neil Clement, who was also red-carded for his part in the incident. Papa Bouba Diop had earlier been sent off for pushing Darren Purse in the face. </p> <p>Fulham were fined, reprimanded and warned as to their future conduct after being charged with \"failing to ensure that their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from violent and/or threatening and/or provocative behaviour\" during the match last month. </p> <p>Cole had been given a hefty ban by the FA, who also charged him with abusing a match official, but reduced his suspension on appeal last week. </p> <p>Fulham's manager Chris Coleman was also fined \u00a3500 and given a warning over criticisms he made about the referee Mark Halsey after the home match against Arsenal on September 11. </p> <p>Fulham's former manager Jean Tigana was back in court yesterday when he claimed that Fulham had wasted \u00a312m in three months by appointing the Italian Franco Baresi as director of football. The former Fulham manager told the high court that he was shocked by the appointment of Baresi in the summer of 2002. </p> <p>The former France midfielder Tigana is being sued by Fulham for damages. The club claims he led them to spend more than \u00a37m on unneccessay transfers, including that of the striker Steve Marlet. Tigana is counter-suing Fulham for \u00a32.1m for money he claims he has lost through share options.</p>",
  "<p>The arrival of another drugs scandal may cause little surprise in some circles. However, these are changing times in the fight for drug-free sport. </p> <p>Should Adrian Mutu's B sample confirm the apparent result of the A sample this could become a test case for football's handling of doping cases after last year's suspension for Rio Ferdinand when he failed to undergo a drug test at Manchester United's training ground. </p> <p>That case, in which I had a personal interest (I had been in charge of the UK's anti-doping programme for 18 years), was finally heard in December 2003 and culminated in an eight-month suspension for the player. Despite an appeal heard in March 2004, Ferdinand was judged ineligible to play for England in the European Championship as well as his club. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the Ferdinand case, the FA doping control procedures were revised and changed in a process overseen by Lord Coe and announced for the 2004-05 season. These mainly concerned issues highlighted by the Ferdinand case. Testers must now physically accompany a player until he provides a sample and club officials have a duty to cooperate in making a player available for testing. </p> <p>The Football Association programme had been subject to considerable criticism by the media and occasionally by those inside the game. But the FA now has the largest testing programme of all sports in the UK and is the only governing body of sport to purchase a significant level of testing above that provided by government funds. This season the number of tests in professional football will rise by 20% to 1,600. </p> <p>On the international scene there have also been important changes. The world anti-doping code came into force in two stages: the standards of testing, analysis and prohibited substances were implemented in January 2004 and the world anti-doping code itself was accepted by Fifa just before the Olympic Games in Athens. </p> <p>The code and standards set the framework for all sports. Some substances can be argued to be in a category where their use has not been intended to enhance performance - in other words that they were simply used for recreational reasons. If the detected drug falls into this category then there may be some leniency, provided the athlete can \"establish that the use of the substance was not intended to enhance sport performance\". The FA has for some years offered rehabilitation and counselling as a way to manage cases in which it feels this approach is appropriate. Otherwise FA regulations propose a minimum six months' suspension. </p> <p>One further change to international arrangements has been the layering of sports organisations as one monitors the actions of another. The FA is watched by Uefa, which is watched by Fifa which in turn will be watched by the World Anti-Doping Agency. </p> <p>If the punishment is not deemed by one of these bodies to fit the crime then there may be an appeal. Fifa has already fined and warned the French, Italian and Dutch football federations for being too slack in punishing players for doping offences. The fines were between 10,000 and 14,500 Swiss francs (\u00a34,500-6,500) with the threat of harsher fines if the associations continued to undercut the minimum six-month suspension and fine for doping offences. Wada, however, wants football to adopt the minimum two-year ban stipulated in its code. </p> <p>And what of the player's chances with his club? If found guilty under the FA disciplinary system, he could be sacked by his club for gross misconduct. This is what happened to Mark Bosnich after he tested positive for cocaine in December 2002 while at Chelsea. What constitutes gross misconduct is largely a matter for individual interpretation by the player's club. </p> <p>A positive test could also have repercussions in terms of insurance. Insurance companies might well decide that a positive test invalidates a player's insurance - for instance, if he should injure another player while using drugs. The Professional Footballers' Association, which has demanded that a player's identity be protected unless and until both samples prove positive, may be concerned that failing a test appears immediately to strip a player of contractual protection. </p> <p>With the overall situation being one body watching another, with employment contracts and insurance liabilities also impacting upon an already complex process, is it right to leave clubs in charge of deciding the interpretation of gross misconduct or for discretion to be applied without reasoned and accountable justification? </p> <p>Whatever happens, the Mutu case will be watched very closely by players, clubs and football authorities here and abroad. </p> <p> Michele Verroken is an independent adviser on sport and business and former director of anti-doping in the UK</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Glazer yesterday bought another 6m shares in Manchester United at 285p each, taking his stake from 25.3% to 27.6% as he continued to signal his long-standing determination to buy the club. </p> <p>It is thought that Glazer, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, hopes to lift his holding to close to 29.9%, the maximum allowed without having to make a mandatory bid for the company. His advisers have made it clear he wants \"parity\" with JP McManus and John Magnier, whose Cubic Expression fund has a 28.9% stake. </p> <p>Glazer's ambition of taking control of United is dependent on being able to buy the Cubic shares. Talks between the two sides broke down last week over the central issue of the conditions that would attach to a Glazer bid for United; the Irish duo said they were not prepared to listen to conditional offers. </p> <p>Meanwhile Shareholders United, the supporters group, yesterday tried to step up the pressure on the United board by calling on the chief executive David Gill to urge the takeover panel, the City's watchdog on mergers and acquisitions, to intervene. </p> <p>Takeover rules include a \"put up or shut up\" clause that allows the panel to impose a deadline on would-be bidders. However, the panel can consider doing so only after a request from the target company. </p> <p>United are thought not to have made such a request so far and the fans' group wants the board to do so. \"Failure to take this necessary step would indicate that the board is receptive to an offer,\" said their chairman Nick Towle.</p>",
  "In an article headlined Caught in the Act, (page 16, G2, June 22), \"Janet\" described her experience of being arrested under the Proceeds of Crime Act for signing her husband's name on documents for a remortgage. Janet was a pseudonym for the author, Anne Garvey. This should have been made clear to readers but was not. Ms Garvey's husband, Andrew Grove, advises us that he was unaware that Ms Garvey had applied for the mortgage until after it was obtained and that he was paying maintenance for his wife and children which was not dependent on the re-mortgage. Mr Grove was obliged by law to report Ms Garvey to the police, especially as he was a solicitor. There is no suggestion that Mr Grove was implicated in the offence in any way. We apologise to Mr Grove for not making his position clear. <br>  In an article, page 29 (Sport) October 13, it was said that Octagon, the former promoter of the British grand prix, had paid sums of \u00a320m to the British Racing Drivers' Club and \u00a360m to Bernie Ecclestone in order to terminate their contracts. Mr Ecclestone informs us that the true sums were, respectively, \u00a327m and $90m, and that the latter sum was received by Formula One Administration, in whose bank account - rather than that of Mr Ecclestone's offshore family trust - it remains.   In a report headed Little sympathy for man who exceeded his brief (about Britain's former ambassador to Uzbekistan), page 4, October 16, we quoted Victor Bulmer-Thomas, whom we described as \"director of Chatham House ... formerly the Institute for International Affairs\". In fact Chatham House is synonymous with The Royal Institute of International Affairs. Chatham House, however, is the title it now prefers.

  "They were feted by Robert Mugabe as patriots and pioneers in a radical redistribution of land to redress colonial injustice. But the war veterans who ousted white farmers have now themselves been invaded. <p>Last month, police units fanned across Trelawney, a rural district outside the capital, Harare, and erased settlements with matches and mallets.</p> <p>The devastation starts just north of Harare and stretches for mile after mile with hundreds of homes wrecked, fields scorched and families gone, leaving the landscape silent and empty. \"Now we are in the position the white farmer was. The authorities used us,\" Richard Mapuringa, 33, said last week, sifting through the ruins of his house.</p> <p>Across Trelawney and other districts there were thousands like him, angry and confused over livelihoods reduced to ashes and a promise betrayed.</p> <p>No official explanation was given for the evictions, but the suspicion was that senior figures in the ruling Zanu-PF party wanted to claim the farms, which had names such as Little England, for themselves.</p> <p>\"You can't accept a government that does this,\" said Mr Mapuringa.</p> <p>But it seems Zimbabweans do accept a government that does this and worse.</p> <p>Inflation exceeds 300%, unemployment tops 70%, decent food is unaffordable for many, freedom of speech and assembly have been crushed and a repressive law muzzling civil society is on the way.</p> <p>Parliamentary elections are due next March but instead of fighting for survival, the party that has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980 is expected to coast to victory.</p> <p>Last year's general strike has not been repeated and protest rallies have not materialised. \"Mugabe is more secure in power now than before,\" said one western diplomat, referring to the country's president.</p> <p>A sullen, resigned mood reigns in Zimbabwe. Since narrowly losing elections in 2000 and 2002, which international observers deemed rigged, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change has floundered.</p> <p>Broke, exhausted and traduced by the media, the party has no way of combating the government's ability to pay the forgers and bully opponents. \"We are cracking under the strain,\" said one MP.</p> <p>Non-governmental organisations used to challenge the regime but several have started winding down operations since being targeted by a new bill likely soon to become law. \"People are disillusioned, they can't see a way forward,\" said one United Nations official.</p> <p>What happened at Trelawney shows how the government can keep a tight grip on power despite chaotic policies and deep internal divisions.</p> <p>Having mobilised the settlers in 2000 to chase away the white farmers and their black labourers the government failed to supply feed, training or equipment, prompting a national collapse in production which has fuelled food shortages.</p> <p>\"At least here we still coped. I was able to grow maize, sorghum, ground nuts, paprika, and enough to feed my family,\" said James Hodzi, 58, a local Zanu-PF party chairman.</p> <p>But in mid-September the police destroyed everything.</p> <p>Who gave the order is a mystery, since no minister has publicly endorsed the policy. Earlier this month a high court halted the evictions, prompting Mr Hodzi and others to return and try to rebuild.</p> <p>But as commercial farmers learned four years ago, a court ruling is no protection from the ruling party.</p> <p>Peasants in Trelawney accused Mr Mugabe's sister Sabina and his nephew Joe of coveting their land. Others said it had been earmarked for army officers. Another theory was of a machiavellian plot to discredit a faction within the party. Whatever the motive, invaders were no longer wanted.</p> <p>\"There is some poetic justice in their eviction but you have to sympathise. They have been used. The small fry making way for the bigger fry,\" said John Worsley-Worswick, of the white farmers' group Justice for Agriculture.</p> <p>Not all sympathised. John Jones, one of the last white farmers in Trelawney, welcomed the expulsion of neighbours he accused of theft. \"It's the way forward if we are to get commercial production back on an even keel.\"</p> <p>However, a few miles further down a dirt track his neighbour Mr Hodzi, a self-styled invader, said he was determined to stay and rebuild the burnt shell of his home. A member of Zanu-PF since 1980, he declined at first to blame the party for his troubles but later suggested there was cronyism in the leadership. Gesturing to his scorched fields he said: \"All this destruction, just so someone can give his girlfriend a present.\"</p> <p>Eliciting praise from a white farmer and anger from erstwhile Zanu-PF supporters, the evictions appear an aberration but one that is unlikely to threaten the party's re-election.</p> <p>With a near monopoly of the media and food stocks, and with a population cowed by security forces, the regime feels assured of victory.</p> <p>On a recent trip to Mozambique Mr Mugabe had a spring in his step. \"We are now, day by day, regaining a noteworthy political and economic stability,\" he told journalists. In other words, the possibility of his overthrow had receded.</p>",
  "Lurking inauspiciously in the half-hour before the lunchtime news, BBC1's Eggheads has quietly eased itself into the lives of those of us with little to do during the day. With Going for Gold a distant memory, and Countdown showing its antiquity, there's every sign that this cheap, almost-apologetic little quiz will become the defining rubbish cult-TV programme of the early 21st century. <p>The format is simple. The resident Eggheads, some alarmingly brainy quiz-show veterans, are pitted against teams of amateurs on multiple-choice questions. That's it. Host Dermot Murnaghan makes pitiful attempts to rack up the tension, even dressing all in black in a doomed bid to emulate Anne Robinson. But it's all pretty low-rent stuff. </p> <p>And yet, and yet. I care about this programme. I like the hopeless teams of estate agents from Wigan. And, above all, I really, really want them to beat the horribly self-satisfied monster that is the Eggheads. </p> <p>Judith Keppel is the most recognisable Egghead, being the posh woman who won Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Then there's Chris (working-class Mastermind winner, not Fred Housego), CJ (future Bond villain), Kevin (monosyllabic know-everything nightmare future father-in-law) and Daphne (sweet old lady, would be the killer in Midsomer Murders). </p> <p>They crush all opposition with the cruel indifference of those whose idea of a good night in is memorising the periodic table. They nod superciliously if challengers answer correctly. Eyes roll at the easy questions. They don't just give a simple answer - they explain its Latin root and in which month of 1623 the word was first recorded. </p> <p>In short, they're insufferable. But it's great telly. And as a licence payer, it's comforting to know that the whole series cost less than a pair of Chris Tarrant's shoes.</p>",
  "<p>Of all the cruel things that were said about her, the one that hurt Diane Blood the most was overheard in the special baby unit, where her son Liam was being treated after a premature birth. Blood's efforts to have a baby had taken her through two court cases. She had been compared to Dolly the sheep; she had been accused, in the manner of her son's conception, of assaulting her husband. She withstood these attacks with relative equanimity, but when a nurse came in and said she'd overheard a politician on the radio saying that Liam should never have been born, Blood crumbled. She wanted to remind him: \"We are real people with real feelings.\" </p> <p>As testament to that fact, she has written a book entitled Flesh and Blood. Liam is now five; he has a two-year-old brother Joel. Their father, Stephen Blood, died not only before they were born but before they were conceived, an act opposed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Stephen died, aged 30, from meningitis. It killed him inside a week. During that time his wife had the presence of mind - the coldness, some would say later, also the \"strangeness\" and the \"sickness\" - to ask doctors if they could extract some of her husband's sperm while he lay in a coma. Incredibly, she and Stephen had talked of what they would do in the event of just such a thing happening. Much of the court case would hinge upon the validity of this conversation and Diane's motives for wanting to honour it. </p> <p>She is 38 and lives in the same bungalow in Worksop that she and Stephen lived in after they were married. She is a freelance advertising copywriter; Stephen worked for her father in the kitchen- and bathroom-fitting business. There are photos of him displayed around the living room, but the house is not shrine-like. Diane's decision to have a second child by her late husband was construed in some quarters as proof that she had failed to move on. But, she says, 10 years after Stephen's death, she is as adjusted as any young widow. </p> <p>\"I don't think the court case altered the course of my bereavement.\" Throughout our conversation she twists a hanky round and round her fingers. \"I don't go on about him all the time.\" </p> <p>How much does she talk to her children about their father? \"They know they had a mummy and daddy that were married once and daddy died before Liam was born. In fact, Liam knows that he died before he was in my tummy, because he knows that he and Joel have got the same dad. But I don't go on about it.\" </p> <p>The conversation she had with her husband about posthumous conception happened in this room. \"Over there,\" she points. \"We were sat round that table. I can picture his face. I've been over it so many times, it seems quite surreal now.\" </p> <p>The conversation was prompted by a magazine article in which a widow expressed her desire to have a child using her dead husband's frozen sperm. Stephen and Diane were, in 1995, already trying for children. In response to the article, Stephen told his wife that, were anything similar to happen to him, he hoped she would consider having his child alone. A few months later, after complaining of flu-like symptoms, Stephen was admitted to hospital, where he rapidly fell into a coma. Amid the panic, Diane recalled the conversation she and her husband had had. With trepidation, she approached the doctors. </p> <p>This is the point at which her critics start to take issue with her. How, they ask, could she possibly give thought to sperm collection when her husband lay dying? Wasn't she embarrassed to ask the doctors? Diane smiles grimly. \"It was, like, now or never,\" she says. \"Does it really matter if you make a complete and utter idiot of yourself and everyone thinks you're completely barmy? The answer was no. I did sort of gulp and think, they're going to think I'm nuts. But I was losing my husband. It didn't really matter what anybody thought.\" </p> <p>The doctors had never heard of such a request. But, knowing of no good reason why not to, they mechanically extracted some of Stephen's sperm and shortly afterwards he died. At this stage, Diane says she was merely acting to preserve the \"possibility\" of having children. She wanted to keep the option alive so that, some time in the future, when she was in a calmer state of mind, she could make a decision. </p> <p>In the days and weeks after her husband's death, Diane says it felt as if, \"there was a knife in my stomach, turning. I'd look in the mirror and I couldn't believe something could hurt so much and not be visible. I was sure I would see myself bleeding. You don't think you'll survive. But you do.\" </p> <p>She waited three months before starting to make enquiries into posthumous conception. When it came, the HFEA's refusal floored her. The authority contested her right to retrieve her husband's frozen sperm on two counts: the fact that Stephen had left no written permission for his sperm to be stored, and, more problematically, her reasons for wanting the child. Did she, in some creepy, unhealthy way, want the baby to replace her husband? (Though how could the courts presume to legislate against such a thing?) Or, as Diane says, did she want to, \"have a child in spite of the fact that my husband had died, not because of it. People said, 'Why don't you get on with your life?' Well, this was me getting on with my life, trying to recoup the bit that I didn't need to lose. Yes, I'd lost my husband, I'd lost a huge part of my life that was irreplaceable. But I didn't need to lose it all. To some people, when they lose a partner, they might want to meet someone else, change job, go in a different direction. And that might be perfectly fine for them. But the right thing for me was to carry on in the job that I'd always loved, and recoup the rest of this life as I'd planned it and as me and my late husband had discussed.\" And that meant having his children. </p> <p>Diane is not one for compromise; she is plain speaking to the point of abruptness. She has been regarded as a fanatic and as a woman in denial, totally unwilling to alter her expectations to fit her new circumstances. But her point is that one does not have to agree with her decision to have her dead husband's children, nor even to like her; one has only to agree that the decision was hers to make and not the HFEA's. \"People talked about autonomy and how this shouldn't be allowed because there was no proof that it's what my husband wanted. Well, there's no proof that's what he didn't want either. Surely the people that knew him best, were me, his family. Surely we're in a better position to judge what he would have wanted than a bunch of total strangers?\" </p> <p>The first court hearing failed but she pressed ahead with the appeal, although if it failed it threatened to bankrupt her. The amazing thing about these efforts was that she didn't, at this stage, even know if she could conceive. </p> <p>\"I was aware of that risk, but the important thing was to try. I needed to have pursued all avenues. I don't think I could have lived the rest of my life knowing that I didn't get a definitive answer. So I had to pursue it to the end, whatever. Even if, although it would have been terrible, I had pursued the legal case and lost. I think that would have been better than not pursuing it.\" </p> <p>It would have been better to have won and found she couldn't conceive than not to have tried at all? \"Yes, definitely. Even though I would have been extremely upset. But the matter of conception, I felt that was in God's hands. Whereas before that, it was man getting in the way saying, 'No, you can't even try.' Nobody can say whether they can have a baby or not, but I think they have the right to try.\" </p> <p>Both Diane's parents and her parents-in-law have supported her throughout, although at one stage she sensed that they thought she should drop it. Her Christian faith has also been important. One Christmas, she got a sense of her late husband trying to communicate with her through the lyrics of a Cliff Richard song (she is going to send him an advance copy). </p> <p>On February 27 1997, the HFEA, acting on a judgment by the Court of Appeal, gave Diane permission to take her husband's sperm abroad for treatment, on the condition that it did not set any legal precedents. If the same thing happened again today, it would be disallowed. The law now forbids sperm to be stored without a man's written permission, something Diane regrets; she wishes her case had set a precedent. But she had fought her battle and won - she never wanted to be a pioneer; her reasons, she said, were entirely selfish - so she hot-footed it to a clinic in Belgium and 14 months later, was pregnant with Liam. Three years later, she went through the same process to have Joel. </p> <p>Did she ever doubt that this was what her husband would have wanted? </p> <p>\"No,\" she says. </p> <p>Would she consider having a third child by him, 10 years after his death? \"Medically, it's very unlikely I'd be able to.\" </p> <p>But would she like to? </p> <p>\"Medically, it's very unlikely I'd be able to.\" </p> <p>She has explained to her older son, Liam, the details of his conception, but he is too young to know what to make of it. He comes home from school sometimes with questions that make it obvious the other children at school have been asking about his dad. When he is old enough, she will give him her book to read. </p> <p>Is she lonely? </p> <p>\"No. There's still a warmth from the fact that I know that I was loved. And I think that's different to if you've simply never met the right person or if you've got divorced. I think there must be some gap, then, an I-want-to be-loved gap. It's hard to be lonely when you're extremely busy with two children.\" </p> <p>And would she like to meet someone else? </p> <p>\"It's not something that I'm looking for, but I don't see it as impossible. It's been made difficult by various things. One: the fact that I was still in love, that I do ... still love my late husband. And two: I've now been through a lot on my own.\" She laughs. \"I mean, I've been out with men who are single, but no romance. If there was a spark, it would've happened. But there's never been any spark.\" </p> <p>We go out into the hall for photos. On a wall hangs a homemade mirror in which shells have been embedded in a frame of clay. Along the top, in childish script, are carved the words, \"by Liam Stephen Blood.\"</p>",
  "In 1993, Richard Allen Davis, a low-life jailbird with a long history of sex offences, abducted 12-year-old Polly Klaas at knifepoint from her bedroom in Petaluma, California. He subsequently raped and strangled her. <p>After the largest manhunt in US history, Davis was arrested. He led his interrogators to the little girl's decomposing body (still, visibly, in the assault victim's splayed out position) as a hunter might show off a trophy. </p> <p>\"I know I'm a piece of shit,\" Davis told the police - which is probably too flattering a description. He was duly sentenced to death. \"Burn in hell,\" Polly's family shouted, as he was taken down. </p> <p>The organisation Klaaskids was set up in the wake of Polly's murder to lobby for legal reform. Their pressure got California's \"Three Strikes\" (3S) law on the books. What that baseball term means is three felony convictions and mandatory 25-to-life. Bad news for bad guys. </p> <p>Had it been in place in 1993, the reasoning went, Davis would have been safely behind bars. The initiative was picked up by other states - although only California has the draconian 25-to-life sentence, no exceptions. </p> <p>The Klaas activists continue to lobby for child protection. They helped get Megan's Law passed in 1996, requiring that citizens be informed of any local sex offenders. They are agitating to raise the threshold for cyber-molestation of minors to 15. Their most recent success is the \"Amber\" alert system. They can be proud of their achievements - and not merely on behalf of children. 3S has reduced other criminal activity. With so many villains out of circulation Los Angeles has been able to thin down its police force to a measly one officer for every 432 of the population (about half what other metropolitan areas need). </p> <p>When they go to the polls on November 2, Californian electors will be asked (via Prop 66) to rescind or continue 3S. The measure will probably survive, despite some troubling anxieties. Even its fiercest proponents did not intend to send fathers away for life for the \"felony\" of shoplifting boxes of baby diapers - which has happened. </p> <p>Prison inmates cost the state $31,000 (\u00a317,100) a year and, given the healthy regime (prisons are now smoke-free zones) cons live long lives. More tax dollars are spent on punishing Californian criminals than educating Californian college students. </p> <p>Is it \"punishment\"? Richard Allen Davis has been on death row for a decade. He's not exactly burning in hell. He has a website (<a href=\"http://www.ccadp.org/richarddavis.htm\">www.ccadp.org/richarddavis.htm</a>) on which he tells his life story - a life which, it seems, he will end peacefully in his bunk. A skilled worker in metal and wood (crafts he was taught in prison), he proudly exhibits his artistic handiwork. He is offering to barter one of his finer pieces for a Smith Corona Display 1000 Electric Typewriter. This self-proclaimed \"piece of shit\" watches cable TV, eats good food, and has enviable opportunities to develop his mind. The only thing the Californian taxpayer doesn't provide him is little girls to abuse. </p> <p>It is in drug enforcement that the severity of post-3S Californian law throws up its most troubling anomalies. Selling as little as $20 worth of cocaine can earn you a \"strike\". Even being near drugs can be catastrophic. </p> <p>Take the case of Freddy Barrios. He arrived in California from Guatemala with his family 20 years ago. Freddy took courses at the Pasadena Arts Center in computer aided design. He's creative and can get more keyboard work than he can handle. Three nights a week, he stars as DJ Freddy B at one of Hollywood's largest clubs, the Arena Cafe. </p> <p>He won't be spinning discs in Hollywood next month. Freddy's brother, a drugs supplier, was targeted in an FBI sting. He had asked Freddy to look after a suitcase, which turned out to contain $30,000 of dirty money. Freddy (who doesn't use, doesn't deal and didn't know) was scooped up with the rest of the ring. His brother got life plus 36 years - a three strikes loser. </p> <p>Freddy will spend three years in Federal Prison. It won't (for a first offender) be San Quentin (where the obnoxious Davis resides) but neither will it be the \"Camp Cupcake\" where Martha Stewart will spend the next few months. When he comes out, the INS will be waiting, eager to deport Freddy to Guatemala. </p> <p>It's not easy to extract a moral other than that life is harder to legislate than baseball.

  "Most people in Kareza, a dusty village two hours north of Kabul, keep animals tethered outside their mud-walled houses. Commander Mafouz keeps two Soviet tanks. The 21-year-old fighter has grown fond of the two green hulks, which still have live shells in their barrels; so fond that he recently threatened to kill the UN team that tried to tow them away. <p>\"My brother died after capturing these tanks from the Taliban. My father died fighting the Soviets,\" he said yesterday, standing defiantly before the T-55 and T-62 nestled under a line of berry trees before his front door. \"I'm not going to give them up just like that.\" </p> <p>Afghanistan's remarkably peaceful election, in which vote counting is continuing, spelled \"the end of the rule of the gun\", declared the US commander Lt-Gen David Barno last week. </p> <p>His prediction may be a little premature. The Taliban threat may have subsided but, after a quarter-century of Soviet, American and Pakistani-fuelled wars, Afghanistan is awash with an exotic array of weaponry. Just how much, nobody knows, but estimates run from 1m to 3m weapons. </p> <p>\"You could start world war three with the amount of ammunition in some places,\" said Peter Babbington, a retired Royal Marine heading the UN-led demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) programme. </p> <p>The 16-month DDR drive has made slow progress. Officials have impounded 70% of heavy weapons - which include tanks, rockets, bombs and terrorist-favoured shoulder-to-air missiles. But only about 21,000 of the estimated 60,000 militia fighters have retired their battered AK-47s. </p> <p>Afghanistan's many warlords, who are agnostics in the campaign to convert them to democracy, are mostly at fault. Efforts by Hamid Karzai's interim government to lure the renamed \"regional leaders\" into politics have only partly succeeded. The Uzbek hardman Rashid Dostum, who is accused of war crimes, contested this presidential election. But many others have remained quietly on the sidelines, some running growing drug empires from the bumper opium crop. </p> <p>The demobilisation officers also have to convince their footsoldiers to give up the gun, no easy feat when an entire generation has known only war. The option of joining the fledgling Afghan national army, with its $70 (\u00a339) monthly salary, seems unattractive to some. </p> <p>As Commander Mafouz stood guard by his tanks, about 200 of his comrades were trudging into the local barracks to demobilise, surrendering battered rifles and old artillery pieces to UN officials. </p> <p>The 21-year-old fighter, who has eight years' military experience but no school ing, might join them, he hinted with a coy smile - but only if the UN offered him a new Toyota 4x4 and a briefcase of cash. </p> <p>A wider problem may be changing attitudes. A long history of bloodshed has embedded a gun culture in many rural areas. Today there is a light police presence, a farcical judicial system, and every Afghan man retains the right to carry his own weapon. Most still do. </p> <p>\"In this country your home insurance policy is an AK-47 over the fireplace,\" said Mr Babbington. \"And if it was taken from Russians, there's no getting it back.\" </p> <p>Memories of Afghanistan's many flip-flops between war and peace have caused some to hide their weapons, no matter how big. </p> <p>In Jalalabad, DDR officials dug five Soviet tanks out of field. In Badakhshan, a community so revered a tank that they built a house around it. But nowhere is the gun culture stronger than in the Panjshir Valley. </p> <p>The 55-mile mountainous corridor was home to the legendary warlord and Afghan hero Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was assassinated by al-Qaida suicide bombers in 2001. </p> <p>It is also, as the locals like to remind visitors, one of the few places never touched by the Taliban. But it has proved equally impregnable to the UN teams, who say it is one of the last areas to resist significant demobilisation. </p> <p>Tanks and anti-aircraft gunbarrels jut from some of the highest peaks in Panjshir. Dozens more line the rocky track that twists along a gushing river on the valley bed. Yet local commanders have forbidden DDR officials from removing even one mortar launcher. </p> <p>\"Go away,\" said an angry soldier as this reporter drove up to a line of tanks parked by the road last Saturday. \"No foreigners are allowed here.\" </p> <p>\"We are taking care of security and the weapons are safe here,\" said Khalil Rahman, an official at the governor's office. \"We don't think it's necessary to send them all to Kabul.\" </p> <p>Politics and pride lie behind the refusenik attitude. Panjshiri resistance was at the heart of the Northern Alliance that overthrew the Taliban; now many feel that their valour has not been recognised. </p> <p>\"During the resistance we saved people's lives; now they say we are just gunmen,\" said Noornudin, a one-time Massoud bodyguard who now stands guard over his commander's grave at a hilltop shrine in the valley. </p> <p>Others feel marginalised by the US-backed government of the ethnic Pashtun Hamid Karzai, who is the frontrunner in this election. </p> <p>Gul Mohammed, a retired mujahid general, curled his hand into a fist and likened it to a map of Afghanistan: \"We are at the heart of the country,\" he said, pointing to his thumb. \"Not like the Pashtuns, who are on the borders.\" </p> <p>The pace of future demobilisation hinges on the election results, the final tally of which is not due for another two weeks. </p> <p>Until now, President Karzai has used a policy of appeasement against the warlords and their troops, trying to nudge them into civilian life. If, as expected, he remains president, he will come under pressure to take more of a hardline approach. </p> <p>Accelerating demobilisation will be critical to success - particularly in the run-up to parliamentary elections scheduled for April. Vikram Parekh, a Kabul-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, says: \"It is crucial to ensuring these elections are fairly contested.\"</p>",
  "As an American who has lived in Britain for over 30 years, I read Carol Gould's description (An American scapegoat in London, October 16) with increasing incredulity. As a regular user of public transport and with constant exposure to people of many different backgrounds, I have never met the visceral hatred of Americans she describes. Indeed, last week's Guardian poll (We like Americans, we don't like Bush, October 15) shows the British have no difficulty in distinguishing between antipathy to Americans and their foreign policy. <p>Naturally, I have heard much concern about the latter, from the debacle of Vietnam to the current Iraqi misadventure - US foreign policy affects the entire world. Gould's wildly exaggerated accusations of anti-Americanism and anti-semitism should not be used as a smokescreen to deny the right of legitimate criticism of the policies of the US and Israeli governments, a right increasingly exercised by many Americans and Jews.<br> <b>Dr Edie Friedman</b><br> London </p> <p>I think and hope Ms Gould's experience is not typical, but it is clear that much of today's hysterical anti-Americanism is merely a surrogate for anti-semitism. Many people cannot stomach the fact that there is a power that wants to protect Jews. They would much rather \"sympathise\" with those who want to murder them. This is usually hidden under the mask of anti-Zionism. As ever, there are Jewish fellow-travellers more than happy to go along with this fraud to prove their liberal credentials.<br> <b>Dr Michael Schachter</b><br> London </p> <p>Ms Gould writes: \"Europe has always been a seething hotbed of anti-semitism.\" She does not mention one diabolically clever way by which the Europeans attempt to conceal this. In the UK, a Jewish citizen (Mr Howard) has been allowed to serve as leader of the Conservative party and others (Messrs Mandelson and Miliband, for instance) are prominent in Labour's senior ranks. In France, the next presidential election will probably have M Sarkozy as the candidate of the right, and M Holland for the left. Each is Jewish. Ms Gould is to be congratulated for not allowing herself to be fooled.<br> <b>Norman Birnbaum</b><br> Washington DC </p> <p>I would certainly agree that when I open my mouth in public, I run the risk of what I call \"that conversation\", which, in my experience, includes the following: \"You left California to come here?

Anyone who has heard the British praise France if it only wasn't for the French, or claim all Italians are sex-mad cowards, knows they distrust everyone equally and, so, shouldn't be surprised that we aren't exempt just because we are so sure we're God's gift.<br> <b> Rick Bryant </b><br> Exeter, Devon </p> <p>The more I considered the article, the more offended I became.

  "Ray Simons, known politically by her maiden name, Ray Alexander, and affectionately as \"Ma Ray\", who has died aged 90, spent most of her life fighting for workers' rights, and for racial and gender equality, in South Africa. She also co-authored, with her husband Jack Simons, Class And Colour In South Africa, 1850-1950 (1969), a classic study of working-class and socialist movements. <p>Ray was born at Varaklani, in Kurland, then a province of the Russian empire, and now in Latvia. Drawn into radical politics at school, she joined the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) within three days of her arrival in the country in 1929. She became involved at once in the distribution of the party's paper and in the formation and organisation of trade unions. She played a part in the formation of a dozen non-racial, though predominantly Coloured and African, trade unions in the Cape in the 1930s and 1940s.</p> <p>Her name is most closely associated with the formation in 1941 of the Food and Canning Workers' Union, which survives today as the Food and Allied Workers' Union. Many of its members were grossly exploited black women. From 1938, when she became a member of the CPSA's politburo, she worked with Jack Simons - whom she married in 1941 - Eli Weinberg, Moses Kotane, and the veteran labour leader Bill Andrews, to rebuild the party. Although loyal to the Communist International line, Ray opposed the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939 and worked throughout her life for a broad alliance against fascism and racism.</p> <p>After the Afrikaner Nationalist election victory in 1948, and the banning of the CPSA in 1950, she was herself banned from trade union work in 1953. Exploiting a legal loophole, she ran in the 1954 parliamentary election as the western Cape's representative of African voters. She was forcibly prevented from taking her seat, but used the campaign to publicise the formation of the Federation of South African Women, in which she was a prime mover.</p> <p>She joined the underground South African Communist party (SACP) on its formation in 1953 (the CPSA had earlier dissolved itself) and continued to be involved illegally in trade union work. Unable to visit trade union offices, she devoted much of her energy in the later 1950s and early 1960s to research, the basis of Class And Colour.</p> <p>When Jack was banned from teaching at Cape Town University in 1964, they were forced into exile with their son, leaving their two daughters at university in South Africa. After two years in Manchester, in 1967 they settled in Lusaka, Zambia, where they spent 23 years. At their house at 250 Zambezi Road they provided a stable social centre in a turbulent and unsettled world of exiles, welcoming all-comers - from leaders, such as Oliver Tambo and Hermann Toivo ja Toivo, to the humblest rank-and-file members of liberation movements.</p> <p>From the mid-1970s Ray worked with Chris Hani, then in Lesotho, and who was to become SACP general secretary, to rebuild the underground structures of the African National Congress. She worked with Jack to understand and to interpret to the ANC and the exiled union movement the rapid changes in South African labour legislation, and the subsequent developments in the internal trade union movement which began in the late 1970s and culminated in the formation of the Congress of South African Trade Unions in 1985. The couple played a vital role in helping the exile movement to keep abreast of change inside South Africa.</p> <p>Ray and Jack had been the first whites invited to join the ANC in exile as full members in 1968, and in February 1990 they were the first ANC members to return to South Africa after Nelson Mandela's release. Ray stepped down from the SACP central committee in 1992, but said that her belief in Marxism was unaffected by Soviet events. She remained politically active until recently incapacitated by a stroke. Earlier this year, she received the ANC's highest award, the Isithwalandwe.</p> <p>Although proud of her achievements, Ray was a modest, quiet person, with a steely determination tempered by charm and humour. She had a talent for diplomacy and worked through her usually gentle, and often irresistible, powers of persuasion. She had an astonishing memory and a phenomenal capacity for work. Above all, she had the ability to convey sympathy for people as individuals. This stemmed from a love of humanity and justice.</p> <p>Jack, with whom she worked for 50 years in a remarkable intellectual and political partnership, died in 1995. She is survived by two daughters and a son.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ray (Rachel) Esther Simons, born December 31 1913; died September 12 2004</p>",
  "<b> Sunday Mirror </b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 17 <br> <p>\"The judgment [in] the treason trial of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) will go a long way in remoulding the way in which both the local and international communities regard matters of governance in Zimbabwe. Against many's expectations, and despite much vitriolic media hype, Mr Tsvangirai was acquitted on Friday. How the case was handled symbolises that there is the rule of law in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>\"There are checks and balances and therefore there was no need for fear that the executive, or the ruling Zanu-PF for that matter, would interfere with the justice delivery system.\" </p> <p><b> Standard</b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 17 <br> </p> <p>\"It was abundantly clear that international fraudster and fortune-hunter Ari Ben Menashe had framed the rather naive Mr Tsvangirai and the charges were trumped-up and politically motivated. Mr Tsvangirai's victory this first round is as charged with sorrow and doubt as it is with joy and gratitude. A second treason charge is hanging over his head and democratic forces everywhere cannot sleep easily. The battle is not over yet. Zimbabweans are in for a long haul.\" </p> <p><b> Daily News</b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"Most analysts called this a political trial, part of Zanu-PF's sinister plot to enfeeble the most formidable opposition political party since independence. The judgment suggests strongly that justice is still alive and well in Zimbabwe, that in spite of attempts by Zanu-PF there are still men and women of conscience who will act in accordance with the law, and not out of warped party loyalty.\" </p> <p><b> Sunday Mail</b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 17 <br> </p> <p>\"The fact that people can sit down and discuss the elimination of a sitting president smacks of conspiracy and to argue that Mr Tsvangirai should not have been on trial is being mischievous. Mr Tsvangirai had himself said it was not him who was on trial but democracy. So if democracy was under trial has it now been acquitted?\" </p> <p><b> Nathaniel Manheru</b> Herald, Zimbabwe, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"Mr Tsvangirai is a man the courts have saved from the gallows, only to be delivered to the guillotine of popular vote, come March 2005.\" </p> <p>\"Skilfully, Zanu-PF has already dubbed the March 2005 election the anti-Blair election, in the process keeping MDC's troubled linkage with the west under a spotlight. The vast western media availed to Mr Tsvangirai soon after his acquittal; the loud sigh of relief that rang loud in the hallways of No 10, the White House and other corridors of the west, only serves to reinforce Zanu-PF's campaign, while firmly nailing the MDC mast high on the pole of empire where it flutters to an ill political wind.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Telegraph </b> Editorial, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"The prospects for the opposition are of continued brutal harassment by an old tyrant, who appears to have concluded that it would be self-defeating to imprison or execute Mr Tsvangirai. Robert Mugabe would thereby make a martyr of a man who no longer poses any immediate threat to his rule. </p> <p>\"In the meantime, the economy continues to unravel. Zimbabweans go hungry while their president makes absurdly optimistic claims about the size of the grain harvest. This is a country going steadily downhill. The acquittal of Mr Tsvangirai, though cheering in itself, will not halt that melancholy slide.\"</p>",
  "There is an elderly woman with a long-winded anecdote about the old days on the prairies; a farmer with a desperate appeal for drought assistance and lower petrol prices; and a set of African refugees who want a group photograph of themselves. <p>Tom Daschle, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, has time for them all. </p> <p>The party's Senate leader stays long after a Sioux Falls community dinner was due to finish, until the last question is answered, and the last anxious words are heard. The tables have all been dismantled and the chairs neatly stacked. </p> <p>For the first time since he entered the Senate in 1986, Mr Daschle is fighting for his political survival. But there is much more than his career in play. Control of the Senate is also at stake, and all that that means - a legislative veto, the right to ratify foreign treaties and the power to shape the supreme court. </p> <p>The Republicans have a two-vote majority in the Senate. The Democrats have an outside chance of overturning that margin, but virtually no chance if their Senate leader loses this excruciatingly tight race to a popular and photogenic Republican, John Thune. \"This is a very pivotal election,\" Mr Daschle said in an interview after the last potential voter had drifted out into the cool, prairie night. \"We can't win back the Senate without winning this race, and the president himself has said this is the second-most important race in the country. It's become the most expensive race per capita in American political history.\" </p> <p>If George Bush is re-elected, Mr Daschle will continue to be the Democrats' last line of defence against the president's second-term agenda. If John Kerry wins the presidency, on the other hand, the senator from South Dakota will be his right-hand man in Congress. </p> <p>Either way, it will make an enormous difference if Mr Daschle is leader of the minority, as is the case now, or of the majority - in which case he will have a decisive say in the Senate's order of business, and his office will become a power centre to rival the White House. \"We are involved on a regular basis, we confirm all ambassadors and ratify all treaties, so it has a huge importance,\" Mr Daschle said. \"The next president and the next Senate are likely to confirm two or three new supreme court justices. There is little doubt that the direction the supreme court takes over the next 20 or 30 years will be determined at this election.\" </p> <p>In America's ongoing culture wars, control of the supreme court is even more important than residency of the White House. The court alone will determine whether the US is a country where abortion is legal, whether restrictions on stem cell research are legalised, whether there are gay marriages, and whether the death penalty is maintained, restricted or banned. </p> <p>Both parties have poured millions into the sparsely populated state, where there are barely 400,000 voters and where the politics are decidedly retail. The big issues are drought, the future of the corn-based fuel, ethanol, guns, and the plight of the Indian reservations, and of a pesky rodent, the prairie dog. </p> <p>The airwaves are choked with campaign advertisements but in a race that will be probably be decided by a few hundred votes either way, both Mr Daschle and Mr Thune know the only real way to clinch a floating vote is to meet every possible voter in person. </p> <p>Hence Mr Daschle's long night at the Sioux Falls com munity centre, and Mr Thune's insistence on as many debates as possible. His campaign asked for 25. The Daschle camp finally agreed to six. </p> <p>The encounters are a far cry from the much-hyped presidential debates, after which a 100 smooth-talking surrogates flood a packed media hall with spin. At a recent Daschle-Thune debate in the small university town of Vermillion, there were two journalists in attendance and Mr Thune did all the post-debate spin himself. He agreed with his opponent that the election was particularly critical in view of the Senate's role in approving new supreme court justices. </p> <p>Mr Thune stops short of saying that a new court should overturn the landmark \"Roe v Wade\" decision that legalised abortion in 1973, saying only: \"The president is not going to have a litmus test, but I do think it means that he will be able to appoint justices who will interpret the constitution.\" </p> <p>As ever in the heated culture wars, the remarks are coded to send an encouraging signal to conservatives, but remain outwardly vague for others. </p> <p>Mr Thune has a lot going for him electorally, as well as the $2m or more that the national Republican party has devoted to winning Mr Daschle's scalp. The former congressman has a vote-winning combination of distinguished grey hair and strong-jawed film star looks - a midwestern version of Robert Kilroy-Silk. He is also a nimble and aggressive debater, arguably stronger than the softly-spoken senator. </p> <p>Again and again at the Vermillion debate, Mr Thune accused his opponent of being \"the chief obstructionist\" in Washington, blocking legislation for the sake of political advantage. He echoed the Wall Street Journal's judgment that the Senate had become the \"Daschle Dead Zone\" for new laws. Each slogan landed with the force of a punch and won cheers from a largely conservative crowd of South Dakotan students. </p> <p>In a mostly conservative state, where 58% of voters are registered Republicans, Mr Thune is playing to a home audience. </p> <p>Mr Daschle's Senate tenure, by contrast, has always been something of an anomaly. He has held on to his seat by cultivating his constituents, making sure he visited every county in the state each term in a 1971 Pontiac, until the old car fell apart. </p> <p>He has also campaigned to the right of the Democratic mainstream. This time, for example, one of his advertisements shows him hugging President Bush a few days after the September 11 attacks. It is not an image that goes down well with hardcore supporters but it helps counter allegations that he is no more than a partisan obstructionist. </p> <p>The senator has also burned some of his bridges with environmentalists by turning against the cuddly prairie dog, blamed by ranchers for eating their pastures. Mr Daschle now backs poisoning them in large numbers. </p> <p>Most of all, Mr Daschle is campaigning on the clout of his office as a Senate leader. It means, he repeatedly points out, this is a moment in history when one of the most important desks in the country is controlled by South Dakota. </p> <p>The Daschle camp is hoping that this pragmatic appeal will be enough to win over at least one in five of the state's registered Republicans, just enough to outweigh Mr Thune's party advantage, and that the margin of victory will be secured by mobilising the state's 40,000 long-suffering Sioux Indians, who are just waking up to their own political leverage. If the election is as tight as it promises to be, they could well determine who controls the US Senate.</p>",
  "There is nothing George Bush likes more than extolling the virtues of democracy in faraway places. On October 8, during the second presidential debate, he promised: \"Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.\" Apparently some Afghans enjoyed their new freedoms so much, they voted for the US surrogate, Hamid Karzai, several times over, after the ink used to mark voters' thumbs wore off. By the middle of the day, all 15 of Karzai's challengers had withdrawn. Freedom was not even limping let alone marching. <p>\"Today's election is not a legitimate election,\" said Abdul Satar Sirat, after he and the other disgruntled candidates had met in his house. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, knew better. \"This election is going to be judged legitimate,\" she said. \"I'm just certain of it.\" When it comes to fixing elections, the Bush administration has a way of making the lame walk. </p> <p>By Monday an exit poll funded by the US government and conducted by the International Republican Institute, which has links to the Republican party, revealed Karzai as a comfortable winner. After diplomatic arm-twisting by the US ambassador, the 15 challengers withdrew their withdrawals. It was a miracle. A few days later, in the final presidential debate, Bush would literally claim divine intervention. \"In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty.\" </p> <p>Back in the US, however, the Almighty seems far less generous. Bush's enthusiasm to export democracy is not matched by his desire to defend it at home. With just a fortnight to go to the presidential election, efforts to obstruct and deny the vote, particularly to black and Latino voters, are intensifying. Forty years after the civil rights act enshrined the franchise in the constitution for African-Americans, freedom is being crippled. </p> <p>The group most likely to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, where they are ostensibly extending democracy and freedom - African-Americans - is most likely to be denied those rights in the US. There is nothing new in this contradiction. In the cold war, when the US lectured the eastern bloc on the delights of democracy, black Americans couldn't vote. </p> <p>The issue of disenfranchisement does not affect only minorities. The use of electronic voting in many states, using machines that leave no paper trail, has sent confidence that a fair election is likely, or even possible, into freefall. Once dismissed as the obsession of conspiracy theorists, fear of fraud is now mainstream. \"Will your vote be counted?\" asks the cover of Newsweek. \"Election protests already started: Fraud intimidation alleged in key states,\" says a USA Today front page. </p> <p>The former employee of a company hired by the Republican party to register voters in Nevada says he was told to throw Democrats' registration forms away. And last January, the Republican Ellyn Bogdanoff won a seat in Florida's senate by just 12 votes, out of almost 11,000 cast. According to state law there should have been an automatic recount; moreover, 137 votes emerged blank. But because the voting had been done by machine there was nothing to recount. Bogdanoff took the seat. The machines will be used on November 2. </p> <p>Sometimes these efforts bear the official imprimatur of local officials. Given the debacle in Florida four years ago, you would think the governor (Bush's brother Jeb) would be anxious to ensure that anyone who wants to vote can. Instead he has introduced a rule that registration forms should be rejected if a citizenship check box is not complete - even when people have signed an oath on the same form declaring themselves to be US citizens. Meanwhile Ohio's Republican secretary of state, Kenneth Blackwell, attempted to enforce a rule by which only registration cards printed on heavy, 80lb paper stock would be accepted, claiming lighter cards might be shredded by postal equipment (meaning that voters who have to re-register on the heavier paper might not make it on time). And last summer the chief executive of Diebold, which makes many of the voting machines, said he was \"committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes\" to Bush. </p> <p>African-Americans, however, remain the principal target of the Republican campaign to block the vote. Unlike the 60s, when black Americans were barred from the polls by police dogs, water cannon and billy clubs, the means today are more refined. Occasionally the mask slips. In July, John Pappageorge, Michigan's Republican state legislator, told a Republican meeting: \"If we do not suppress the Detroit vote, we're going to have a tough time in this election cycle.\" Detroit is more than 80% black. It does not take a genius to work out whose votes he was keen to suppress. </p> <p>So far it has mainly been a mix of petty harassment and bureaucratic pedantry, devised to intimidate newly registered and poor voters, a huge proportion of whom are black and Latino. Take Florida. According to the Washington Post, African-Americans in Republican-run Duval county were the most likely to have their voter registration forms rejected, while rejections for Democrats outnumbered Republicans by three to one. In 2000, 42% of ballots rejected by the Duval county election board came from mainly black areas. </p> <p>In Ohio, Mr Blackwell also told election boards that anyone who turned up at the wrong polling station would not be able to cast a provisional ballot (to be verified later). The Democrats successfully sued, saying that the ruling would disadvantage minority and poor voters, who tend to move more often. </p> <p>It is not difficult to fathom what is driving these efforts, which are being replicated throughout the country. The best indication of how an American will vote is race. More than 80% of African-Americans voted Democrat in the last election. Incapable of persuading them to vote Republican, Republicans now seek to prevent them voting Democrat. </p> <p>This task has become particularly urgent because voter registration recently ended in many states, revealing that voter rolls in black and Latino areas have swollen in far greater numbers than in Republican precincts. Between the last election and August this year, almost 200,000 additional black voters were registered in Florida. </p> <p>So while these attempts are clearly racial in nature, they are essentially partisan in motivation. With apologies to Malcolm X, they are about winning by any means necessary. Republicans support democracy when democracy supports Republicans. But they are equally happy to do without it when it is inconvenient. That was always true abroad, from Venezuela to Nicaragua and Pakistan to Saudi Arabia. Now it is true at home, from Detroit to Duval County. </p> <p>Freedom is on the retreat. And the man who assumed office four years ago thanks to thousands of disenfranchised black voters is again leading the charge. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Israeli general who commanded the destruction of the only Jewish settlement in the Sinai before it was returned to Egypt recently offered Ariel Sharon advice on how to carry out his pledge to remove settlers from the Gaza strip. <p>\"Evicting someone from the home they've lived in for 20 years isn't a simple matter,\" wrote Brigadier General Obed Tira. \"To remove a family from its home is embarrassing and difficult, and that is why the removal needs to be done with a lot of love and a lot of wisdom.\"</p> <p>The soldiers who arrived outside the home of Ghalia Abu Radwan, her octogenarian parents, blind siblings and assortment of children in Khan Yunis in the middle of the night showed no love, and, if they were embarrassed, there was no way to know it because they were hidden behind the armour of their bulldozers and tanks.</p> <p>As the loudspeakers on the tanks ordered the families out, and bursts of gunfire sharpened the terror, Mrs Abu Radwan shepherded her blind brother and sister to safety.</p> <p>\"I grabbed them by the hand and shouted to my mother to follow us,\" said Mrs Abu Radwan. \"Think of it - 25 children, two blind adults and my parents who cannot run. My sister-in-law left her three year-old behind in the chaos and had to go back to get him. When we came back they had destroyed all the houses.\"</p> <p>Mrs Abu Radwan's mother, Ommuhammed, said she thought she would also die.</p> <p>\"I kept imagining a piece of shrapnel hitting my head. I was so exhausted I had to crawl in the sand sometimes or put my hand on Ghalia's shoulder and let her pull me,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Since 1948, the Israelis have demolished three of my homes. This is the most difficult because before others helped us rebuild but now everyone needs help and I don't know who will help us.\"</p> <p>While Mr Sharon agonises over how to draw 7,500 Jewish settlers out of Israel's Gaza colonies - offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation to each family - the army has already bulldozed close to 9,000 Palestinians from their homes in the Gaza strip this year alone.</p> <p>Most got no more than a few minutes notice to get out and lost all but the possessions they could hurriedly bundle together.</p> <p>The latest target was Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza city. From dawn on Saturday the people came, trying to find their bearings amid the rubble and then scrambling across the sand where once there was an asphalt road.</p> <p>A man ripped at the remains of his shattered home in search of anything that could be saved, burrowing out a picture, some clothes, a schoolbook. Another collapsed on to the wreckage, stunned and silent.</p> <p>The tide began as soon as it was clear that Israeli tanks had pulled out of Jabaliya after 17 days of destruction and killing. The bulldozers left behind dozens of flattened homes and hundreds homeless.</p> <p>The remains of the mosque were marked by its twisted steel minaret and loudspeakers. A sewage line torn from the ground spewed filth as people attempted to jump it. The only clue to the existence of a small orange grove was a few of the scattered fruits.</p> <p>The scale of the destruction - about 20 acres of homes, shops and roads razed or ground into the sand - matched the Israelis' controversial assault on Jenin refugee camp two years ago. But the death toll in Jabaliya was double that with about 130 people killed, one in six of them children 15 or younger.</p> <p>Within hours of pulling out of Jabaliya, the army's bulldozers were at work again in another Gaza refugee camp, Rafah.</p> <p>\"One would have thought that the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip would decrease house demolitions,\" said Kenneth Ross, director of Human Rights Watch, after visiting Jabaliya.</p> <p>\"In fact, house demolitions have risen dramatically. This seems to reflect on the one hand a political show of force and Sharon's desire not to be seen to withdraw under fire, but also part of his vision to create a buffer zone along the Egyptian border. It is also part of a wider pattern of punishing civilians.\"</p> <p>A United Nations human rights report on the Israeli occupation to be presented to the general assembly this month accuses Israel of \"massive and wanton destruction of property\" in the Gaza strip.</p> <p>\"Bulldozers have destroyed homes in a purposeless manner and have savagely dug up roads, including electricity, sewage and water lines,\" it says.</p> <p>Most of the destruction is focused on Rafah, along Gaza's border with Egypt, and neighbouring Khan Yunis refugee camp.</p> <p>But in recent weeks there has also been widespread destruction of homes as the army widened the \"security zone\" around Netzarim Jewish settlement, and in the Palestinian towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lehia.</p> <p>The pummelling of Rafah in May left about 4,000 people homeless. Four years ago, buildings in the refugee camp ran right up to the military area on the border, known as the Philadelphi road. Half of Rafah's Block O neighbourhood has since been destroyed.</p> <p>Even after Israel pulls its settlers and soldiers out of the Gaza strip, it will remain the occupying power under international law, and it intends to strengthen its grip on the territory's borders. The disengagement plan speaks of \"widening the area\" along the Philadelphi road.</p> <p>\"So far about 10% of Rafah is destroyed and if Israeli plans are carried through, approximately a third of Rafah will be destroyed,\" said Mr Ross.</p> <p>With the destruction comes death. In July, a 75 year-old man in a wheelchair, Ibrahim Halfalla, was crushed to death under the rubble of his Khan Yunis home by an army bulldozer because he did not get out in time.</p> <p>As Mrs Abu Radwan and her family fled, the army shot dead a 60-year-old neighbour, Ahmad Abu-Nimer, as he fled. Two other men were wounded by gunfire.</p> <p>Israel says the demolitions meet the international legal requirement of military necessity because homes are destroyed in the hunt for weapons smuggling tunnels or because they are used by Palestinian combatants to attack Israeli forces.</p> <p>The UN and Human Rights Watch say that is merely an excuse. They say it would be more efficient, and safer for Israeli troops, to detect and close off the tunnels behind the protective wall the military has built along the border by using listening devices and ground penetrating radar.</p> <p>They add that the number of tunnels found is relatively small in comparison to the number of buildings destroyed.</p> <p>The army claims to have uncovered 90, but that number includes several entrances to the same tunnel and the beginnings of wells.</p>",

  "Britain will decide within days whether to grant a US request for troops to cover for the American army in Iraq, the defence secretary Geoff Hoon announced today, although he insisted that the US request was purely military and not political. <p>To a clearly anxious House of Commons, Mr Hoon confirmed that a request for assistance had been received on October 10 and that the chief of defence staff would reach a decision by the middle of the week.</p> <p>But he repeated that the demand for UK troops to fill in for Americans south of Baghdad, while US troops undertook operations against \"terrorists\" elsewhere in the country, was purely an operational decision.</p> <p>Mr Hoon received the full and unqualified support of only one MP for his statement - the Tory backbencher Quentin Davies - while others questioned him closely as to the government's exit strategy, time limit, chain of command, terms of engagement, the rules of the international criminal court and which particular UK troops would be deployed.</p> <p>The defence secretary said there was a \"strong operational justification\" for the request, and, if granted, it would be \"one ally strongly supporting another\".</p> <p>A forward reconnaissance team would examine the area of deployment tomorrow, he revealed.</p> <p>Mr Hoon refused to debate \"precise details\" of the terms of the international criminal court if UK troops killed Iraqi civilians, but said, in reference to the previous restraint shown by UK peacekeepers in the south of the country: \"This will be less restrained if there is a direct threat to them.\"</p> <p>In a sombre hour-long presentation to MPs, Mr Hoon was repeatedly quizzed as to whether the decision had already, in effect, been taken - an accusation which he rejected, although when asked he did not name any other occasions when US requests had been turned down.</p> <p>Mr Hoon told MPs the British troops would not be required to serve in Baghdad or Falluja. He added: \"There has been considerable speculation in the media over the past several days about the United Kingdom deploying forces outside its current area of operations in southern Iraq. </p> <p> He went on: \"Iraqi security forces and coalition forces have recently been involved in intensified operations to restore areas under the control of militants and terrorists to the authority of the Iraqi interim government. Recent operations in Najaf, in Samarra, and in North Babil have been undertaken as part of this effort. </p> <p>\"The political process is moving ahead as a result of these actions. This strategy is designed to increase pressure on, and deal with, those terrorists who are trying to prevent the rebuilding of Iraq, and who threaten the holding of free elections in January. </p> <p>\"The US request is for a limited number of UK ground forces to be made available to relieve US forces to allow them in turn to participate in further operations elsewhere in Iraq to maintain the continuing pressure on terrorists. </p> <p>\"The request does not ask for British troops to be deployed to Baghdad city, nor to Falluja.\" </p> <p>Mr Hoon refused specifically to confirm that the UK troops involved would come from the Black Watch regiment, currently serving as the reserve in the UK area of operations. </p> <p>But he responded several times to MPs' questions asking if the regiment would have to stay beyond its routine six-month tour of duty, scheduled to finish by the end of the year. </p> <p>He said the Black Watch were \"determined to carry through this operation, should it be decided they participate\". </p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, and the ex-Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, asked whether British troops operating under American rules of engagement could be subject to prosecution under international criminal court rules. </p> <p>Mr Hoon refused to discuss details of the troops' rules of engagement but said ICC action would only ever be taken where the soldiers' own country would not take action. </p> <p>\"We would take action,\" the defence secretary said.</p> <p>Mr Hoon came in for particular criticism from the phalanx of anti-war MPs on the Labour backbenches, with veteran leftwing MP Dennis Skinner saying that - by definition - \"If it's done before November 2, its political. It's handing President Bush a lifeline.\"</p> <p>Former shadow foreign secretary Gerald Kaufman received the largest cheers for complaining that there was a risk that \"UK forces risking their lives will be exploited in a US election\".</p>",
  "<p>MUTU UNDER THE MICROSCOPE</p> <p>Adrian Mutu and his advisers have flown into London for crisis talks at Chelsea after the Romanian striker reportedly tested positive for cocaine. Mutu is said to be \"shocked\" at the news that he failed a test earlier this month, which was first reported in yesterday's Mail on Sunday. Mutu now faces an anxious wait while the B sample is tested - should he be found guilty then he could face a two-year ban from football.</p> <p>Meanwhile Mutu's agent, Victor Benali, has denied that Chelsea had leaked the story. \"I have heard a lot of people in Romania saying that this is Chelsea's revenge against Mutu but I do not agree because it is not in the interests of the club to make public such a story,\" he said. \"They have their own interests in selling Mutu. But you can imagine how the player feels, he already had technical problems at Chelsea and now this has just made it even worse.\"</p> <p>Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the PFA, expressed his disappointment that Mutu's identity had been leaked. \"We have been aware for a short time there had been a positive test because we work with the FA on drug-testing procedure but this is a breach of confidentiality,\" he said. \"It has all got to be confidential and I don't want people to jump to conclusions.

With a hotel, restaurants, bars, and designer shops too, the complex will offer a Ridsdale-esque 150,000sq ft of ways to waste money. \"We are delighted to announce the development of this exceptional site in Leeds,\" grinned chief Stanley suit Bob Wiper, \"we believe it is the best location for a casino in the north of England [given the local propensity for throwing good money after bad].\"</p> <p>\"We plan to build an exciting casino complex to rival any other development,\" he wittered on, ignoring the fact that new gambling legislation is yet to come into force, not to mention that the Fiver had by this point wandered off to feed lots of Big Paper's coins into a slot machine in the name of research. \"It will be a huge entertainment attraction of which the region can be proud [thus providing a stark contrast with our new neighbours, snigger, snort, guffaw].\" Ah.

  "<p>A Conservative government would put a quota on the number of students who could be awarded A-grades at A-level, scrap AS levels and allow schools to go back to teaching O-levels, moves which the party's leader, Michael Howard, today said would put the \"gold standard\" back into secondary schools. </p> <p>Mr Howard outlined his party's solution to the problem of exams in response to the government-backed Tomlinson report which today proposed to scrap A-levels and GCSEs and introduce a diploma.</p> <p>Signs that the Conservatives are prepared to go head-to-head with the government over the issue of exams reform - and crucially what part A-levels will play - place schools at the heart of the political debate ahead of the general election, expected in May 2005. </p> <p>The Tory proposals include a quota system on grades, which would prevent the escalation of the number of pupils receiving A-grades since the move to fixed marking, whereby an A is allotted a certain fixed standard and whoever reaches it would be eligible. </p> <p>The AS exam would be dropped to make A-levels a two-year course again and students would not be allowed to take multiple resits of their exams. Schools could also opt to take other qualifications available such as the International Baccalaureate or O-levels, which were replaced by GCSEs nearly 20 years ago but are still taken overseas. </p> <p>Unlike in the Tomlinson proposals, which would see a major slimming down of externally marked exams, a Tory government would retain external marking at 16 and launch a major overhaul of the exams watchdog, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA). </p> <p>\"The QCA has become too ardent a defender of every aspect of the present system. That has undermined its position as a credible referee. As a first step, we would overhaul the QCA entirely, so that the exam system is policed by people who are committed to maintain standards,\" the Tory proposals say.</p> <p>In his speech to the Society of Editors in Newcastle this morning, Mr Howard attacked both the government's policy on expanding access to university to 50% of 18-20 year olds as well as the proposal that everyone should leave school with a diploma under their belts. </p> <p>\"The trouble with the current approach - where all should have prizes and more and more people should go to university - is that the genuinely talented and ambitious, from whatever background, lose out and are held back,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This approach is not simply wrong; it will also undermine Britain's long-term competitiveness. I want Britain to be blazing the trail, not lagging behind. I am ambitious for our country. An educated workforce is the key to success in today's highly competitive, global markets.\"</p>",
  "<p>Our schools face three main challenges.</p> <p>First, lack of choice and competition. Second, a decline in school discipline. Third, the whole question of the standard of exams. </p> <p>I have spoken before about the first two of these challenges and set out our plans to give parents the opportunity to choose the best school for their child; to allow good schools to expand; and to give headteachers the power to expel disruptive pupils. </p> <p>It is on the third of these challenges - the standard of exams - that I want to focus today.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to go to a grammar school. I have no doubt at all that I received as good an education as any one in the country, even those in the best public schools. I learned in a disciplined, rigorous environment. I was constantly challenged. And by being challenged, I succeeded. </p> <p>Today, there is widespread debate about exam standards. Some people think that exams have been dumbed down and downgraded. Others believe that pupils have become smarter and teachers better.</p> <p>It is a debate often conducted as a shouting match between two mutually uncomprehending camps, each unwilling to accept that there is any validity in the other's point of view.</p> <p>The truth, of course, lies somewhere in between.</p> <p>The numbers achieving passes and top marks in all exams have been growing steadily - not for seven, but for 20 years. This trend has continued under both Conservative and Labour governments at pretty much the same rate, and there is no obvious difference between the increase before 1997 and the increase since then. </p> <p>So, depending upon your point of view, Labour ministers cannot claim all of the credit - and Conservative ministers cannot escape all of the blame.</p> <p>It was the last Conservative government which introduced the National Curriculum, standard tests, and league tables. At the time, we argued that they would increase school standards. So it would be odd for us now to add a caveat - that they would increase school standards until only 1997. Clearly, these reforms have had a beneficial effect on school grades and continue to do so.</p> <p>Yet, despite all this, serious questions remain. </p> <p>First, there is concern about the number of exams and the impact this has on education as a whole. Many teachers are concerned that pupils face a barrage of exams. Extra curricular activities are crowded out. Teachers have become adept in preparing their pupils for exams. The ability to \"work the system\" - which was once confined to the fee-paying sector - has now become widespread and ruthlessly efficient within the state system too. </p> <p>Then there is the standard of exams themselves. People ask - how can it be sensible for a student, who only gets 45% at a higher level maths GCSE, to be able to walk away with an A grade; or one who only gets 16% to walk away with a pass? And people also ask - why is it that some recent A-level maths papers are in several respects virtually identical to O-level papers set 30 years ago?</p> <p>No wonder some of today's examiners say, for example, that: \"The A-level system has been bankrupted by grade inflation.\" No wonder the former chief examiner, Tony Whelpton, has said: \"Yes, it is easier to get a good result at A-level and GCSE than it used to be.\" </p> <p>We know that employers - and you, as editors, who recruit so many young people - complain that a rising number of school-leavers are functionally innumerate and illiterate. We also know that nearly half of all vice-chancellors are having to lay on remedial courses for first year undergraduates. </p> <p>Let me stress again that I am not querying the hard work or effort of individual pupils. They have to work within the prevailing exam system. </p> <p>But it is not enough for ministers to argue, as the schools minister did earlier this year, that any questioning at all of exam standards is unacceptable or the product of elitist thinking.</p> <p>We must restore public confidence, strengthen the robustness of our exams, rebuild the international reputation of our exam boards, challenge the most able, and provide much more encouragement for those at all levels of ability.</p> <p>Conservatives do not approach these matters in a partisan fashion. We accept our share of responsibility for the present situation, and have consistently made it clear that we will work with others wherever possible in order to find a way forward.</p> <p>We agree that the need for reform of 14 to 19-year-old education is urgent and necessary. Today, the government's working group has published its proposals, some of which are sensible and practical. The recommendation to cut back on course work is one of them. And we support making vocational education more rigorous and part of mainstream education. </p> <p>But what is vital, above all, is to restore trust and faith in our exam systems. </p> <p>Just like a currency, the value of exams can erode over time - and if this carries on for too long uncorrected, a clear revaluation becomes necessary. That time has come. So today, I am setting out our plans to achieve that. </p> <p>First, the A-level. A-levels remain the best means of testing students' academic knowledge and potential. A-levels should not therefore be abolished. Any new diploma must express clearly on the front the subjects and grades achieved at A-level. In addition we will introduce a new top grade for A-level which clearly identifies those who have achieved the best academic results. We also propose other changes which will reinforce the status and credibility of the A-level to ensure that it is recognised as the gold standard of the exam system that we wish it to be.</p> <p>For many years, the exam boards used to award roughly the same proportions of grades each year. Then, in the 1980s, the Conservatives allowed exam boards to use what was called criterion referencing. This defined the required standard in respect of, for example, an A grade. This objective was so that all those pupils who achieved that standard were awarded an A grade. </p> <p>Over the years, it has become clear that it is nearly impossible to do this with any precision. As a result, the number of students receiving an A grade has grown strongly and steadily in every successive year. It is no longer possible for either universities or employers to know that someone with the highest grade at A-level is automatically among the best and brightest of their year. In short, the present approach just doesn't work. So we will change it.</p> <p>Instead, we will ensure that the highest grade of A-level should only be awarded to a fixed proportion of students sitting that subject that year. </p> <p>This will clearly identify the students who have achieved the very best results of all those sitting the exam.</p> <p>Second we will ensure that the actual exam mark, as well as the grade, is published for each candidate.</p> <p>This will ensure that there is once again a fair way for universities and employers to distinguish between candidates who have similar grades.</p> <p>Third, A-levels need to be made more thorough and demanding. </p> <p>The AS-level will go, returning the A-level to a two-year course. We also think it wrong that students can retake parts of their A-levels time after time. So we will stop multiple resits of individual modules within A-levels. </p> <p>Fourth we will begin an immediate reform of the exam regulators and exam boards. </p> <p>We had originally planned that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which is supposed to safeguard exam standards, should be made independent of government. But in light of recent criticism and concern, we have decided that this would be the wrong approach. The QCA has become too ardent a defender of every aspect of the present system. That has undermined its position as a credible referee. To give it independence now, when it has lost people's faith, would be wrong. </p> <p>Instead, as a first step, we would overhaul the QCA entirely, so that the exam system is policed by people who are committed to maintain standards. In particular, those in charge must never again be defenders of the view that less than half the marks could be sufficient for an A grade at A-level. </p> <p>We also propose some other changes. We will remove the DfES rules which prevent schools offering alternative, internationally-recognised exams such as the International Baccalaureate or the O-level. It is clearly absurd that O-levels continue to be written in the UK for students abroad, but cannot be taken by state school pupils in the UK. </p> <p>And we will scrap targets. </p> <p>We cannot and will not support the target for 50% of all young people to go to university. Neither the employers' organisations, nor many academics, regard the 50% target as necessary. </p> <p>We will also scrap targets for the numbers of young people receiving particular grades at 16 or 18. The priority should be for ministers to give teachers and schools the backing they need to raise standards for all - not for Whitehall to have any incentives, real or apparent, to try to manipulate exam results. </p> <p>We must also raise performance in literacy and numeracy. Employers are rightly furious when they find that the taxes they pay to finance full-time education produce so many school-leavers who cannot read, write or add up. </p> <p>The top priority for primary and secondary schools must be to teach all children to read, write and add up properly. That's the best way to give youngsters a good start in life. Under our Right to Choose policy, remedial action will be taken against schools that fail. Governors could be required to appoint a new head teacher or the failing school could be taken over by a successful school.</p> <p>Finally, the Tomlinson report believes that we should move away from external assessment at 16. </p> <p>We do not. </p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce and others have made it clear that they cannot expect their members to treat an internally assessed qualification as adequate. I agree with them. </p> <p>Nor could school league tables possibly be fair if schools had such an incentive to manipulate results. Of course, the vast majority would do no such thing. But it would only take a very few to be caught doing it for the whole process to be discredited. So we propose instead a more robust, more vigorous, more independent regime of external assessment - with incentives throughout for accurate, rather than convenient, results.</p> <p>We do not favour the abolition of GCSEs. Instead reform should seek to make them more rigorous and more credible. External assessment is an essential prerequisite for that. </p> <p>These are practical proposals that the next Conservative government will implement in its first term. </p> <p>We will revalue our examinations to restore faith in them. Assessment will be less frequent, more independent, tougher and more credible. </p> <p>The trouble with the current approach - where all should have prizes and more and more people should go to university - is that the genuinely talented and ambitious, from whatever background, lose out and are held back.</p> <p>This approach is not simply wrong; it will also undermine Britain's long-term competitiveness. I want Britain to be blazing the trail, not lagging behind. I am ambitious for our country. An educated workforce is the key to success in today's highly competitive, global markets. Editors, more than most, know this to be true.</p> <p>Conservatives believe that every child deserves the chance to be stretched, challenged, and uplifted by the exams system.</p> <p>Admission to university must depend on a proven academic merit, best demonstrated by a fair and robust exams system. It should not be determined by social engineering.</p> <p>That is why so many universities are now expressing resentment at the government's interference with their freedom to decide on admissions.</p> <p>Last week, ministers appointed the first state university access regulator - who promptly announced that he is \"old Labour\" in his views and of the opinion that the principal problem facing higher education is what he called \"class\". Very few universities, employers or even students, would agree.</p> <p>That is why one of our immediate commitments under our Timetable for Action is to abolish the post of university access regulator as soon as we come to office.</p> <p>For every student and every employer needs to be able to have confidence that certificates, diplomas and access to higher education genuinely reflect merit and ability.</p> <p>The next Conservative government will make sure that this is so.\"</p>",

  "<p>TV watchdogs have condemned Big Brother's \"fight night\" in June, declaring the \"intensity and repetition of verbal and physical violence\" excessive.</p> <p>Ofcom today ruled that live coverage of the drunken brawl, which broke out after contestants Emma and Michelle were unexpectedly returned to the Big Brother house from the bedsit, breached its programme code.</p> <p>The regulator agreed with 55 viewers who complained about E4's coverage of the fracas on June 17, when security guards had to step in and the live feed to the Big Brother house was cut for an hour following a violent confrontation between Emma, Nadia, Victor and Jason.</p> <p>Ofcom criticised Channel 4 for allowing the drink-fuelled fight, in which the Big Brother dining table was overturned and the living area in the house trashed, to go on for \"approximately 20 minutes\" before sending in security guards.</p> <p>The regulator also carpeted Channel 4 for continuing to run on-screen text messages on E4 during the fight giving the impression that the broadcaster viewed the violent scenes as entertainment.</p> <p>Text messages broadcast during the fight included, \"This is quality. LOVIN IT. COME ON J!\" and \"this is the bomb let them fight\".</p> <p>\"We acknowledge the concerns of the viewers of Big Brother Live on E4, who knew the full background to the situation and who saw a potentially dangerous situation develop and who had no way of predicting the outcome of this situation. This was frightening and concerning for some viewers, so much so that some called the police,\" Ofcom said today, in its ruling on the incident.</p> <p>\"Although the voice of Big Brother tried to calm the situation by summoning housemates to the diary room, it was approximately 20 minutes (in real time) from when the fight turned physical to when security guards entered the house. The apparent absence of intervention by Channel 4 to prevent the situation escalating to this point, having 'engineered' the situation originally, clearly caused distress and offence to viewers,\" the regulator added.</p> <p>\"The offence was compounded by the text message captions running at the bottom of the screen, which gave viewers the impression that Channel 4 was continuing to treat as entertainment a situation that had, from what viewers could see, become serious,\" Ofcom said.</p> <p>\"In this context, we feel that the intensity and repetition of verbal and physical violence exceeded viewers' expectations.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 defended the editorial decisions taken by Big Brother producer Endemol's programme-making team on June 17, insisting the situation never got out of control.</p> <p>\"Although feelings were clearly running very high on June 17, the argument primarily involved pushing and shouting. The producers at Elstree studio were very confident that the situation in the house was under their control and that all the Big Brother competitors were safe,\" the broadcaster said in a statement.</p> <p>\"Although these were not comfortable scenes to watch, the producers decided that the events in the house should be relayed to viewers until the shouting had abated to reassure viewers that the outcome was not as bad as they might otherwise have imagined,\" Channel 4 added.</p> <p>\"Ofcom took a different view and we must accept their decision.\" </p> <p>The regulator dismissed separate complaints from 190 viewers about the 10pm highlights edition of Big Brother, featuring the events of \"fight night\", which was broadcast on Channel 4 on the evening of June 17.</p> <p>Ofcom also disagreed with a further 83 viewers who complained about how the fight had effected the well being of Big Brother participants and about the eviction of Emma following the June 17 fight.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>American \"broadband service may get a little broader in the next few years, now that the Federal Communications Commission is graciously stepping out of the way \", reports <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2004/10/18/fcc_ruling_sets_stage_for_broadband_surge/\" title=\"Boston.com / Business / Technology / FCC ruling sets stage for broadband surge\">the Boston Globe</a>.</p> <p>\"Last week, the agency laid out new rules that should give the big telecom companies a big incentive to build us a better network. In their most controversial move, the FCC said that phone companies can build high-speed fiber-optic lines to within 500 feet of customers' homes without having to share the new lines with rival companies.</p> <p>\"That didn't thrill consumer advocates, who fear that companies ... will seize monopoly control of our broadband access and hose us down with absurdly high prices... Sure, monopoly abuse is a worry. Let's worry about it once we've gotten the nation wired.\"</p> <p>It's interesting from a British perspective - mainly because, despite claims to the contrary, we've got a monopoly on those lines in all but name. Right now BT owns the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_loop\">local loop</a> and rents it out to other broadband providers. But what if it didn't - what if other parties could use the local loop for free? Would broadband costs drop drastically? Would other providers start installing their own, higher quality lines?</p> <p>While the vast geographical distances to be covered in the US may cause concern over potential monopolistic behaviour (a new gold rush for broadband provision), from a British consumer's point of view, the best way forward would be to get rid of loop ownership altogether.</p> <p>Still, splitting up the providers from the infrastructure isn't without dangers - just look at the mess that was made of rail privatisation in the UK and you get an idea of how such things can be bungled.</p>",
  "Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, is facing a revolt over plans to deregulate the gambling industry, with one influential Labour backbencher, Frank Field, warning she was off her rocker if she thought she could get the legislation passed. <p>There are signs that some cabinet ministers are looking again at the planned deregulation with fears that the spread of casinos will prove unpopular, especially ahead of an election. They are pressing for a rethink on the bill. The leader of the Commons announced last week that the bill would be published soon. </p> <p>There has been an large increase in gambling revenues in Britain, mainly due to the rise of online gambling, and critics claim that further deregulation will increase addiction. </p> <p>Ms Jowell is convinced that the gambling laws need updating and that casinos could regenerate some run-down areas. A bill is due to be published in the next few weeks and carried over into the next parliamentary session so that it can reach the statute book before a May general election. </p> <p>A draft gambling bill, largely scrutinised by peers and MPs with interests in aspects of the gambling industry, has already been published. </p> <p>The bill is needed to regulate the boom in gambling on the internet. It is also needed to regulate roulette wheels in bookmakers, but due to heavy lobbying, the legislation has been combined with a wider deregulation of casinos. </p> <p>Frank Field, the former welfare minister, said yesterday on GMTV: \"I think the government is off its rocker thinking, even if it was the first year of a parliament, that it would actually get this through. And once they actually let this tide of big money from America come in in this way there will be no turning it back\". </p> <p>The Tory former shadow culture minister Julie Kirkbride warned: \"The sheer access to it will create a lot of unhappiness and a lot of family distress, and whilst we might want to make it available in one or two places in the country, do we want it on our doorstep in every town and city across our country?\"</p>",
  "<p>Stanley Leisure, the UK's biggest casino operator, today announced plans to build a \u00a3125m hotel and gambling complex next to Leeds United's Elland Road stadium.</p> <p>The casino, which Stanley said would create more than 1,000 jobs, will be built on a seven acre site next to the football ground. Stanley has already spent \u00a35m buying Leeds United Properties, a subsidiary of the cash-strapped club, whose sole asset was an option to purchase the land.</p> <p>Subject to planning permission and the deregulation of the gambling laws, which is expected to happen by next year, Stanley will build a \"regional casino\" complex on the site. </p> <p>The gambling bill, which is likely to get its first reading this week, restricts category A slot machines, featuring unlimited jackpots, to larger, regional casinos.</p> <p>Stanley's Leeds venture will feature a 150,000 sq ft casino as well as a hotel, restaurants, bars, leisure facilities and designer shops. The company said the site, which is close to the M1, M62 and M62, has a catchment of more than one million adults living within an hour's drive.</p> <p>\"We are delighted to announce the development of this exceptional site in Leeds, which we believe is the best location for a casino in the north of England,\" Bob Wiper, Stanley's chief executive, said.</p> <p>\"We plan to build an exciting casino complex to rival any other development in the UK, which will be a huge entertainment attraction of which the region can be proud.\"</p> <p>Stanley's announcement comes five days after Caesars Entertainment, the owner of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, revealed plans to build a \u00a3330m casino complex next to Wembley stadium in a joint venture with the UK property developer Quintain Estates. </p> <p>Caesars' rival Las Vegas Sands has announced proposals to build a casino next to another Yorkshire football stadium - Sheffield United's - as well as at Glasgow Rangers and West Ham United.</p> <p>Stanley said it was in discussions with potential partners for its Leeds project, which it expects to complete by the end of 2007. It added that before then, it expects its Star City casino in Birmingham to achieve regional casino status, \"soon after the new legislation is introduced\".</p> <p>Stanley Leisure shares were up 5p to 424p at 10am.</p>",

  "<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens today spoke of his frustration at not being able to talk to the media about anti- terrorism investigations and said only \"a very small proportion of the story\" had been told.</p> <p>But he appeared to score an own goal when he spoke of the dilemma facing police - asking whether it was right that the police wait to get evidence of terrorism before arrests were made.</p> <p>And he criticised some parts of the media for \"missing the point\" with \"cynical\" coverage of anti-terrorism measures.</p> <p>Sir John told an audience of newspaper and television editors terrorism prosecutions were \"enormously complex\" and that the police could not afford to make \"any disclosure that would undermine the progress of authorities\".</p> <p>\"We've got a great story to tell - and I know you all want to tell it. Unfortunately, we are bound to withhold much of the detail - and as much as you are frustrated by that, I and the officers I work with are equally frustrated,\" Sir John told the Society of Editors conference in Newcastle.</p> <p>\"There is a need to challenge some of the more cynical perspectives out there. Those, for example, who compare the number of arrests that have been made with the number of charges brought under specific terrorism legislation are, to some extent, missing the point.\"</p> <p>But he went on to ask whether it was right to wait for sufficient evidence to be gathered before arrests were made. </p> <p>\"Do we act now to ensure people are not killed or maimed or do we wait a week or two and gain the evidence we need to arrest those people?\" he said.</p> <p>Research published in September of the arrest pattern since September 11 2001 shows that only three of the 15 people convicted up to then under anti-terror laws are known to be Muslim - and two of those have been granted leave to appeal. </p> <p>However, the report said the number of arrests of Muslims was disproportionate to the conviction rate. At least two-thirds of the 287 arrests examined - out of a total of 609 - were Muslims. The report said the discrepancy provided evidence of \"excessive and discriminatory use of arrest powers\".</p> <p>Sir John appealed to newspaper editors to help demolish the myths surrounding terrorism and urged them not to fall into the lazy trap of branding Muslims terrorists.</p> <p>There was, he said, a need to \"challenge every inaccurate and uniformed stereotype\", adding, \"and you're a major player in that\".</p> <p>And he stressed the role of the media in community policing, urging journalists to take care to \"avoid the terms 'Muslims' 'Terrorists' and 'extremists' being linked.\"</p> <p>Sir John, who retires in January, spoke of the \"new threshold of threat\" faced in Britain, adding, \"the dynamics of terror have been transformed\".</p> <p>\"I think we have everything to gain and much to lose in terms of the way we talk about terrorism,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the media didn't have the whole picture because the police couldn't be triumphant in their war against terror for legal reasons.</p> <p>\"Decisions [about what to say to the media] demand significant sensitivity and discretion. I for one would like to tell the world about the successes but I cannot do so because it would affect trials.</p> <p>He said there was a public hunger for information about the police's anti-terrorism measures - that 16 had been convicted since September 11 and a number of others were awaiting trial. </p> <p>Sir John praised the Muslim Council of Britain for issuing a statement condemning the killers of Ken Bigley and said it was \"vital\" that Britain maintained the confidence of Muslims.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>BSkyB is hoping to combat slowing subscriber growth and take on Freeview with a major marketing initiative offering a \"Sky in a box\" product alongside baked beans and washing-up liquid in Tesco and other retailers.</p> <p>It has signed deals with Woolworths, Argos and Tesco and hopes to woo impulse purchasers with a product priced at just \u00a339.99.</p> <p>It is the first time the pay-TV giant has offered its decoders in non-specialist shops - although in the early 1990s it did offer subscriptions from stalls in shopping centres.</p> <p>For \u00a339.99 consumers will be able to buy a box containing the Sky remote control and a reference number to call to arrange installation of the dish and set-top box. The cost of the equipment and installation is included in the purchase price, as is an introductory subscription offer. </p> <p>Those who buy the box, or receive it as a gift, will be able to choose either one month's free subscription to Sky's premium package, including the sport and movie channels, or two months' free subscription to its \"family pack\".</p> <p>\"The Sky Starter Pack makes our product available in a convenient form through mass-merchandise retailers for the first time,\" said Jon Florsheim, BSkyB's managing director of sales, marketing and interactive. </p> <p>\"This initiative is another part of our commitment to remove barriers to purchase and deliver great entertainment to consumers in a way that fits their own preferences.\"</p> <p>Much of the rapid growth of Freeview, the free-to-air digital service backed by the BBC that is now in over 4.5 million homes, has been due to the availability of \"plug and play\" set-top boxes in high street retailers. </p> <p>The boxes, costing from just \u00a335 and giving free access to 30 digital TV channels, have become an impulse purchase for many. </p> <p>BSkyB continues to insist that it doesn't see Freeview as a threat, hoping it can migrate viewers to pay-TV once they have a taste of multichannel, but it will hope that those considering picking up a free-to-air box will consider the Sky alternative if it is on display nearby. </p> <p>The new boxed product, which will initially be available in more than 1,000 Argos and Woolworths stores across the country and 60 of Tesco's large superstores, is also aimed at the Christmas gift market. </p> <p>National press advertising, in-store displays and listings in the retailer's Christmas gift catalogues will support the launch. </p> <p>The move, due to be announced later today, is expected to be just one arm of a massive promotional push approved by the BSkyB chief executive, James Murdoch, to combat a slowdown in subscriber growth. </p> <p>In August he announced a \u00a325m a year boost to Sky's marketing budget in an attempt to appeal to pay-TV sceptics who had not previously been tempted by the lure of exclusive films and movies or who believed that getting a dish installed was too much of a commitment. </p> <p>Earlier this month the company unveiled its biggest marketing campaign in six years, designed to highlight the wide choice available on Sky and also targeting families with nursery age children. </p> <p>BSkyB dominates the pay-TV market with 7.4 million subscribers, with 90% of new customers buying top-tier deals costing \u00a339 to \u00a341 a month. The group is now targeting potential customers with cheaper packages, previously a low priority. </p> <p>The marketing push comes amid City speculation that subscriber growth has struggled in the three months to September. But Sky insiders remain confident that figures to be unveiled next month will prove the sceptics wrong. </p> <p>BSkyB added 66,000 customers in the first three months of 2004, a traditionally fallow period for subscriptions, but disappointed the market when it gained 81,000 subscribers in the second quarter against expectations of 100,000 to 130,000. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p> <b>UNEASE OVER US REQUEST FOR BRITISH TROOPS</b></p> <p>When, on a fine Monday morning, you find Kate Winslet grinning radiantly at you from virtually every front page, you might assume that there is very little news around. Fortunately the Wrap is on hand to ferret out the good stuff from the inner pages. </p> <p>First, the hard news: For any Brit who has ever heard an American expounding at length on how they saved the British in WWII (and the attendant \"you'd be speaking German today if it wasn't for us\" palaver), today's reports provide some small payback. Someone, it seems, needs a bit of help fighting that war-that-won't-go-away in Iraq. </p> <p>The US has requested British troops to patrol south of Baghdad, thus freeing up US soldiers for the continued fight in the rebel-held town of Falluja. But the request for the Black Watch immediately sparked fears that it was a ploy by George Bush to convince the American electorate that he had a strong coalition of countries supporting the war in Iraq. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, is to make a statement on the matter to the Commons today.</p> <p>\"People want to be reassured that our armed forces are not being asked to further President Bush's election campaign, or to clear up a mess left by American forces,\" the Telegraph says. </p> <p>The Independent feels the whole subject should be put off until after the November 2 election.

  "US forces yesterday continued their ferocious assault on Falluja in a military offensive apparently designed to bring the city back under the control of Iraq's pro-US government. <p>Fierce clashes broke out between US troops and insurgents on a highway east of Falluja, witnesses said, and in the southern part of the city. The road to Baghdad had been blocked, witnesses added.</p> <p>A car bomb exploded late last night near a cafe in Baghdad's fashionable Jadiriya district. Al-Arabiya television said seven people were killed and about 20 injured.</p> <p>Residents earlier reported new US air and artillery attacks as explosions boomed across the city. Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the eastern suburb of Askari and the southern area of Shuhada as families began to flee the area, residents said.</p> <p>A burning Humvee was seen on Falluja's eastern edge, they added. By sunset, US troops had pulled back, setting up a checkpoint south-west of the city, witnesses said.</p> <p>Two Americans were killed on Saturday when a pair of helicopters crashed south of Baghdad, and four US soldiers died in car bomb blasts in northern Iraq and near the Syrian border on Friday. </p> <p>Ayad Allawi, Iraq's pro-US interim prime minister, demanded that residents in Falluja hand over the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Yesterday Falluja clerics said they were willing to negotiate, but this was impossible while US planes were pulverising the city. \"We are still ready to go back to the talks and open new channels of dialogue,\" the negotiator Abdul Hamid Jadou said.</p> <p>Iraq's US-appointed rulers seem determined to recapture Falluja, which has been under the control of insurgents since April. Yesterday's US assault appears to be part of a broader strategy to try to regain control of Iraq's rebellious Sunni heartland in advance of elections scheduled for January. The US military, meanwhile, claims that foreign terrorists led by Zarqawi have taken over Falluja, and use it as a base to attack American troops.</p> <p>In the US's last major offensive, in April, as many as 500 civilians died, a significant number of them children. On Saturday hospital officials said that US artillery shells hit a house in Halabsa village, 10 miles south-west of Falluja, killing a three-year-old girl and injuring four family members, three of them children.</p> <p>Over the weekend US jets attacked a checkpoint in the town apparently operated by Tawhid and Jihad, the brutal insurgent group led by Zarqawi and responsible for the execution of Ken Bigley and other western hostages. Three people were killed in the strike, Falluja's hospital said.</p> <p>In a separate development, Zarqawi's group said in an internet statement that it would take orders from Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida from now on.</p> <p>Britain's ambassador to Iraq, Ed Chaplin, yesterday appealed to Iraqis to help find the body of Mr Bigley, who was beheaded by his kidnappers.</p> <p>On Saturday, meanwhile, five churches in Baghdad were firebombed, in what appears to have been the latest attempt to sow sectarian unrest between Iraq's different religious communities. Nobody was hurt.</p> <p>Three people were killed yesterday when a mortar was fired in Baghdad's Sadr City at a collection point for Shia fighters to give up their weapons. The US military had extended a deadline from Friday to yesterday for militiamen loyal to the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to trade their weapons for money.</p>",
  "The last man to have been sent to prison for blasphemy in Britain was John William Gott who was jailed in 1921 after ridiculing Christ for entering Jerusalem \"like a circus clown astride the backs of two donkeys\". <p>Mr Justice Argyll sentenced Gott, a man in his 60s, to nine months hard labour and told him that any person of strong religious feelings who read his secularist pamphlet would instinctively want to give him a thrashing. </p> <p>He was jailed under a common law offence which has its origins in medieval courts. Blackstone's Criminal Practice defines it as \"the publication of matter which vilifies or is contemptuous of or which denies the truth of the Christian religion or the Bible or the Book of Common Prayer\". The blasphemy has to be couched in indecent, scurrilous or offensive terms likely to shock and outrage the general body of Christian believers and it carries a maximum life sentence. </p> <p>Gott died shortly after finishing his sentence and even 80 years ago the case sparked an outcry. The public wanted to know how such a medieval statute could still be used while legal protection for a \"sober reasoned attack\" on Christianity had existed since the middle of the 19th century. </p> <p>That defence was confirmed in the 1880s during the attempted prosecution for blasphemy of Charles Bradlaugh, the freethinker and atheist MP for Northampton, who founded the National Secular Society. </p> <p>Even though Gott's case was more than 80 years ago the offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel have never been far from public debate in Britain. </p> <p>Mary Whitehouse, the moral crusader of 1970s Britain, was particular keen to revive their use. She first tried to invoke the blasphemy law when Alf Garnett posed the question \"wot abaht yer virgin berf, then?\" in a 1972 episode of the BBC television comedy, Till Death Do Us Part . </p> <p>But Mrs Whitehouse did not succeed until she mounted her infamous private prosecution of the editor of Gay News for blasphemous libel in 1976 after he published James Kirkup's poem, The Love That Dares Speak Its Name. Denis Lemon was given a nine month suspended sentence and a \u00a3500 fine for publishing the \"most scurrilous profanity\" which portrayed the sexual love of a Roman centurion for the body of Christ on the cross. The sentence was upheld on appeal in a judgment in which Lord Scarman argued that the blasphemy law should be updated to cover all religions. </p> <p>Mrs Whitehouse threatened a rerun of the Gay News trial when Martin Scorsese's film, The Last Temptation of Christ, was released in Britain in 1988. The British Board of Film Classification received more than 1,870 letters demanding that it be banned because of its depiction of sexual fantasies involving Mary Magdalene. The BBFC director, James Ferman, managed to defuse the impending crisis by the politically smart move of inviting 28 bishops, deacons and priests to actually see a preview of the film in his Soho Square viewing room. Ferman had no desire to be seen as the censor who banned a film made by America's then most prestigious living director. </p> <p>The clergy didn't like the film but they didn't think it was blasphemous and, more importantly, were prepared to say so publicly. The result was that when it was finally released it was to little public fuss. </p> <p>It was against this background that some figures in the Muslim community soon afterwards attempted to mount a prosecution for blasphemous libel against Salman Rushdie for his book, The Satanic Verses. The attempt failed when the appeal court said it was not prepared to extend the blasphemy law's protection afforded the established church to other religions, including Islam. </p> <p>The Law Commission had already recommended the abolition of the blasphemy laws in 1985. The appeal court judges said that since the only mental element in the offence is the intention to publish the words complained of, there would be a serious risk that the words might, unknown to the author, scandalise and outrage some sect or religion. It was to be the standard Home Office response to all those who wanted to extend the blasphemy law to other religions - that it was impossible to define in law the difference between a religion which deserves protection and a cult or a sect which does not. </p> <p>But the refusal to allow the blasphemy law to be used to prosecute Rushdie did not mean it had fallen into total disuse. In 1996 the European court of human rights upheld the use of this ancient blasphemy law to justify a ban on an erotic video, Visions of Ecstasy, about a 16th century nun. </p> <p>The case to scrap the blasphemy laws received a boost in 1997 when the report from the Runnymede Trust's commission on British Muslims which first studied the extent of Islamophobia recommended a new offence of incitement to religious hatred should be created rather than extending the blasphemy law to all religons. </p> <p>The need to protect people from possible public order offences rather than religions from criticism was a distinction which was not lost on the home secretary, David Blunkett. Within months of becoming home secretary in 2001 he made clear what he thought: \"This provision has not been used for a very long time. It's my own view that there will come a time when it will be appropriate for the blasphemy law to find its place in history.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Travis is the author of Bound and Gagged, a secret history of obscenity in Britain, published by Profile Books at \u00a37.99</p>",
  "<p>When I embraced hip-hop in the 1980s, rappers were concerned with ghetto youths' obsession with gold rope chains. Now we've moved on to ice-encrusted Rolexes and necklaces so studded with rocks that it's no wonder rappers work out. </p> <p>What you hear today is not hip-hop, it's rap music. Hip-hop is a cultural movement born to draw together disaffected youth and give us somewhere not only to belong, but where we can excel. Hip-hop is not something you do or hear, it's something you are. Rap music is just rap music. </p> <p>Part of the reason young people don't march as the conscience of a nation anymore is that most hip-hop is now merely rap. Our political leaders and media moguls, with their skillful use of language, make sure that people don't know that before one can usefully help the weak, one must first tackle the greed that works to keep them weak. And rappers, with their love of bling, reinforce this ignorance. </p> <p>The truth we are not told is this: while we continue to display our childish lack of self-esteem by adorning our bodies with things that others can't afford - in particular, diamonds - then African children, mothers and fathers will continue to be slaughtered. With our love of bling, we in the west heedlessly fuel the unimaginable misery of millions of Africans. </p> <p>Brutal civil wars in Angola, Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone are mostly fuelled and funded by \"conflict diamonds\", an illegal trade where armed militia control mines, and even entire diamond-producing regions, in order to trade the rough diamonds directly for guns. In the 70s there was an eerily similar trade in Jamaica: guns for ganja - a straight swap with American gangsters. The crucial difference is that the Jamaican gunmen moved into the local town to prosecute criminal activity; they didn't visit systematic rape and massacre upon the locals until they had all accepted the invitation to leave. </p> <p>Three million people were murdered in Congo alone over the past five years as a result of this disgusting trade. So why not make conflict diamonds illegal, remove their value to the murderers and ethnic cleansers, and consequently the cause for the killing? </p> <p>For the answer, I can only point you in the direction of the Kimberley Process, a diamond certification scheme signed up to by 60 countries, which was set up in the 90s after international condemnation of the trade. The said 60 countries agree to monitor their import/export of rough diamonds and weed out those gems covered in innocent blood. </p> <p>As you might expect from a body of super-billionaires left to regulate themselves, the system doesn't work too well. Amnesty International says it's inadequate and open to abuse. The organisation has demanded independent and transparent monitoring of all stages of the trade and called for consumers to be more aware and to refuse to buy conflict diamonds. </p> <p>The participating governments of the Kimberley Process should not leave it as a matter for the conscience of their citizens or the compa nies that make fortunes from the diamond trade. </p> <p>In November 2003, the US General Accounting Office stated that al-Qaida used diamonds to \"earn money, move money and store money\". And yet the world still allows the \u00fcber-rich of the diamond industry to police themselves. You'd be forgiven for thinking that, with evidence of this nature, the US would be keen to regulate the flow of these deadly stones. But 50% of all conflict diamonds are sold in the US. The diamond industry generates $6.8bn every year. Bling rules, greed is good and, as the (increasingly) down-trodden of that country often remark, \"Ain't a damn thing changed\". </p> <p>Well, here's where a difference might be made. London is the capital of the world's diamond industry, with 60% of the world's rough diamonds passing through the capital. The British government needs to show some leadership and make independent monitoring mandatory. If it actively encourages the other Kimberley Process partners to do the same, it would have a big impact on this evil trade and may even help bring security, if not peace, to these ravaged regions. </p> <p>Johann Hari, a columnist for the Independent, wrote last year: \"The central myth of Blair's premiership has been the belief that you can improve the lot of the poorest without challenging the powerful\". Well that, dear reader, is the plain and simple truth - ask anyone who's actually made a difference to ordinary people's lives, ask Gandhi, ask Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela. </p> <p>Given that the Kimberley Process utterly ignores this principle - and the plight of millions of Africans - I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that African-Americans on MTV, whose entire video budget probably costs less than their wristwatch, also appear to be ignorant of just how many child soldiers are bullying child workers in blood-soaked diamond mines in Sierra Leone. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Maxi Jazz is a rapper with the band Faithless.

  "Last Friday Michael Howard made a speech in Scotland which, as far as I can tell, no English newspaper thought worth reporting. The news editors were guilty of a collective misjudgment. In a country which believes that the English-based Labour party has lurched to the right, Howard accused it of \"lurching to the left\". The speech was not the stuff on which election victories are built. Its importance lay in what it revealed about the current state of British politics. <p>Howard's first complaint - made in a country which recognises the benefits of the comprehensive system - was that Labour wanted \"less selection in schools\". Thirty years ago, the Conservative party wanted to abolish selection altogether. Margaret Thatcher had completed her four years as secretary of state for education and science during which she destroyed more grammar schools than either Shirley Williams or Tony Crosland. Edward Boyle, one of her Tory predecessors, had told the House of Commons that he would believe the 11-plus examination was acceptable to parents when he heard that a boy or girl had been given a bicycle for failing the examination. According to the Howard definition, Thatcher and Boyle were the dupes of a far-left conspiracy. </p> <p>Perhaps the training levy - which requires companies to meet the cost of their employees' technical education and is another item in Howard's litany of far-left excess - is a controversial idea. It was when the Tories introduced it 40 years ago. I ran the scheme in Harold Wilson's government. My shadow demanded more and more training boards - the mechanism through which the levy was raised. Perhaps he was secret communist. </p> <p>Howard's speech, as you would expect, contained a good deal of rhetorical nonsense. The Labour government will not renationalise the railways. Nor will it remove all private sector involvement from the public services - a notion not even favoured by Albania in the 1950s. But it is his definition of the policies that Labour has accepted (or may accept) which give his speech a historical significance. He complains about extending employment rights to temporary workers, increasing statutory holidays and parental leave and endorsing the EU's working-time directive. </p> <p>All these policies are accepted by European governments of every persuasion and regarded by most reasonable people as essential elements in the working life of a civilised society. They have two other common characteristics. By no reasonable definition can they be described as exclusively socialist and they have been incorporated into Labour thinking against the wishes of the prime minister. </p> <p>The suggestion that any of those policies represents a \"lurch to the left\" reveals more than Howard's desperation. It illustrates how far the nation has drifted to the right. Despite all the posturing, the two main parties - as represented by their leaderships - are ideologically closer together than they have ever been. Europe, which divides them, is not an issue of right and left. The argument about public spending is a dispute about degree not principle. Both believe the market solves all problems of efficiency and allocation. One rejects, the other fears, equality. But, largely thanks to the Blairite project, the gap that separates the Tories and Labour has dramatically moved its position on the political spectrum. </p> <p>Clement Attlee dragged a reluctant Tory party to the left. Winston Churchill endorsed his party's \"industrial charter\" when he was told that a failure to support the nationalisation of the public utilities would reduce his chances of regaining power. His newly elected government embraced the welfare state and accepted the trade unions as partners in its plans for industrial expansion. In 1997 Labour, equally anxious to return to office, travelled in the diametrically opposite direction - and the Conservative party retreated in the face of its advance. The triumph of social democracy had a strange effect. It pushed the whole political debate 20 degrees to the right. </p> <p>Ten years ago, extremists were politicians who wanted to privatise air traffic control and accused the Attlee government of encouraging the dependency culture. The prime minister has done the first and talked glibly about the second. Having fought against mindless militancy for years, I should be pleased that it is now defined as an enthusiasm for longer parental leave. Tony Blair should, however, be worried about what the new definition of extremism reveals about his place in history. One of John Arlott's basic rules of cricket also applies to politics. Good players contribute to the game. Great players change its direction. Attlee shifted the balance of British politics. Harold Macmillan tagged along behind. Mrs Thatcher first halted the pendulum and then swung it back to a position further right than it had been for 50 years. Tony Blair has gone with the swing. It will not be much of an epitaph. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "In the past three months, British forces in Iraq have been attacked more often than at any time since the invasion. It is a largely untold story, however, since few British journalists have been able to get on the ground to report the situation for fear of kidnap, and it can be difficult to get access to the military. <p>Peter Kilfoyle, the former Labour defence minister, spoke for many at the weekend when opposing the redeployment of 650 British soldiers nearer to Baghdad on the grounds that \"We are putting our troops in harm's way and subject to the vagaries of how the Americans do things\". This is true, but with two caveats: our troops are already in great danger in the \"peaceful\" south, where armed resistance to the occupation is intense; and \"how the Americans do things\" already makes life very difficult for British soldiers. </p> <p>Last month, I spent 12 days working between the British stronghold in Basra and the more northerly town of Amara, dubbed the \"wild west\". Embedded with the Territorial Army, but seeing the work of regular soldiers as well, I discovered that in these areas, and on the roads in-between, troops are being shot at with small arms, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades every single day. Six have been killed in the past two months, and one described to me how he lost his kidney on a run-of-the-mill job to pick up mail and a broken television. </p> <p>Soldiers told me the reason there had not been more casualties was poor shooting, but they didn't expect such incompetence to last. In the run-up to January's proposed elections, things are likely to get worse, not to mention the predictions of increased activity during the fasting month of Ramadan. </p> <p>Amara has been under almost non-stop attack since late summer when the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr declared holy war on British forces. The leadership of the town - tribal and divided in its nature - has pledged allegiance to Sadr. </p> <p>In August, one unit was shot at more than any British battle group since the Korean war. In what has been dubbed the Battle of Cimic House, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment came under siege at an HQ set up in the downtown home of the former governor of Maysan province; in 10 days they were bombarded with 428 mortar rounds, 57 rocket-propelled grenades and countless 107mm rockets, and 86 small-arms attacks were counted. The troops fired 30,000 rounds of ammunition, more than was used in the whole of last year's \"war\" phase. There is no accurate record of the number of Iraqi casualties, but the soldiers I spoke to expected it to be high. </p> <p>At the same time as the onslaught in Amara, 200 men of B Company, 1st Battalion The Cheshires, were also besieged in their compound in Basra. In May, 60 Iraqis died in the Battle of Danny Boy - a checkpoint 15 miles south of Amara. A recent raid on the HQ of the Office of the Martyr Sadr (the cleric's organisation) in Basra uncovered dozens of mortars and \"improvised explosive devices\" and 155 artillery shells - a hollow victory as such weapons are easy to replace, particularly through the porous border with Iran. </p> <p>The number of attacks has meant that troops are often unable to leave camp to work on the decrepit infrastructure. Nor do they take their \"soft hats to win hearts and minds\", an approach seen after the fall of Saddam. Soldiers must wear helmets and body armour outside their heavily fortified camps. Many spoke to me of their frustration at not being able to get out and work on the promised rebuilding of Iraq. </p> <p>In a briefing, Captain Donald Francis, a spokesman for the Multinational Division (South-East), said that the British had 90% consent in the area, but it didn't seem like that on the ground. He admitted that there was evidence that the British had become a problem in the eyes of the local people, and that they were trying to fix that by moving bases from populated areas and agreeing with Basra council not to turn the city into a battlefield. </p> <p>In the recent heavy fight ing, Francis estimates that between 100 and 150 Iraqis had been killed, but no real records are kept. He said: \"We are not into body counts or how many people we kill. Every time we kill an Iraqi we will create a nationalist, and we are not in the position to wipe him off the face of the earth. We haven't got enough guns or soldiers.\" </p> <p>So the mission was not to kill, but to neutralise \"anti-Iraqi forces\" - a term coined by the coalition to describe the people shooting at them, even though most armed militants are Iraqis. </p> <p>An unusually frank military spokesman, Francis admitted the invasion brought with it some strategic mistakes. Disbanding the Iraqi army was a big one. \"We took away something which worked in its own way,\" he said. \"Security has been an issue since the day we arrived.\" But this is only one of the problems facing occupied Iraq - unemployment is very high and the failing infrastructure, including lack of power, oil, water and sewerage, will take years to fix. </p> <p> Almost 65% of the population of Basra does not have a tap supplying drinking water, sewage runs in thick green channels along the sides of roads, 60% of the fuel is still smuggled out of the country while Iraqis wait in line for overpriced petrol and still the power works on a \"three hours on, three hours off\" basis - as it did under Saddam. This adds up to a frustrating picture for the average Iraqi, never mind the young militant. The danger facing British troops is that this already perilous situation becomes explosive when mixed with the repercussions of US behaviour in Baghdad, Najaf and Falluja. As many soldiers were keen to point out: \"Whatever happens in Baghdad and Najaf trickles down to here.\" Any redeployment of British troops to the north will intensify this danger - dramatically so, if they are put under US military control - but it will not have created it. </p> <p>One evening I drove with British soldiers through downtown Basra, escorting a couple of American National Guards to the Basra Palace compound. Traffic was heavy, and the larger American sat twitching in the back. He wished he had taken the \"chopper\" the few miles up the road. An ambulance approached, its blue lights cutting through the darkness. A soldier up on top of our Land Rover waved the ambulance on. Peering out of the window on the back door, the American panicked: \"Whoa,\" he said, \"they should have shot that guy.\" No vehicle, ambulance or otherwise, can drive past a US convoy for fear of suicide bombers. </p> <p>Back in the camp at Basra Air Base, I described the scene to a senior British officer, who sighed: \"Don't they see it's a chicken-and-egg situation\". It was an apt metaphor for the whole country. Until the violence stops, a new Iraq can't be built. Until a new Iraq is built, the violence won't stop. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:audrey.gillan@theguardian.com\">audrey.gillan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Britain's ancient laws of blasphemy and blasphemous libel are likely to be repealed under proposals being considered by the home secretary, David Blunkett. <p>The move is being considered as part of a package that will include a new offence of incitement to religious hatred, in order to make clear that freedom of speech and the freedom to criticise religions will not be curtailed. </p> <p>Home Office officials disclosed that Mr Blunkett was considering the abolition of the blasphemy law at a recent meeting with the National Secular Society, in answer to their concerns about the creation of the new incitement law. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman confirmed that it was an option under active consideration: \"We are interested in whether the blasphemy laws should be retained, extended or amended in any form.\" </p> <p>Home Office ministers believe that the repeal of the blasphemy law will help answer critics, including the comedian Rowan Atkinson, and make clear that the new incitement law will not bar criticism of religion, cartoonists' lampoons, or jokes about vicars and priests. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said three years ago that he favoured scrapping the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. \"This particular provision has not been used for a very long time,\" he told MPs on the Commons human rights committee in 2001. \"It is my own view that there will come a time when it will be appropriate for the blasphemy law to find its place in history.\" </p> <p>Labour MPs who back the change have argued that the distinction is needed because \"blasphemy outrages people's sensibilities, whereas incitement endangers their material and physical well-being\". </p> <p>Keith Porteous Wood of the National Secular Society said that it would welcome any proposal to move away from the blasphemy law. \"We have been fighting this for over 130 years,\" he said. </p> <p>But the secularists are also concerned that a section of the 2001 emergency anti-terrorism legislation comes close to creating an \"all religions\" blasphemy law, allowing judges to impose a sentence of up to seven years if an offence is found to be aggravated by motives of religious hatred. </p> <p>Mr Porteous Wood said that the offence, which is in line with similar heavier penalties for racially aggravated crimes, caused the society concern be cause of its impact on freedom of speech. </p> <p>The Muslim Council of Britain has strongly welcomed the decision to introduce a new offence of incitement to religious hatred, saying it closed a loophole in the law exploited by far-right groups who had adapted their old racist rhetoric intovirulently anti-Muslim invective. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett attempted to introduce the offence in 2001 emergency anti-terror legislation, but was opposed in the House of Lords, where it was felt it was an inappropriate measure in a bill dealing with terrorism.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty-five years ago last Friday, two young women walked into Broadcasting House on the first steps of their career at the BBC. Both were outsiders of a sort, one an American economics graduate, another a former grammar school girl from Middlesex. Neither had any expectation that, exactly a quarter of a century later, they would emerge not only as friends, but two of the most powerful people in British television. </p> <p>Yet the rise of Jana Bennett and Lorraine Heggessey, to director of television at the BBC and controller of BBC1 respectively, has been one of the defining moments of the corporation's recent history. Both thrived under Greg Dyke - although both had served in senior positions under previous regimes - and both are spoken of as future director generals. But they have also come to embody some of the criticism about the direction taken by the corporation in recent years: Heggessey, in particular, has taken much of the flak, including a particularly misogynistic insult from the Daily Mail of \"Dyke in a skirt\". Bennett, although the more cerebral of the two, has not escaped; presumably she was one of those women targeted last week as having helped to \"dumb down\" the BBC. </p> <p>Both have been angered by the suggestion that the promotion of women at the BBC could, let alone has, led to a trivialisation of BBC television, and decided to use the anniversary of their first day at the corporation to dismiss the charges. Interviewed separately - their chock-full diaries only allowed for a snatched 10 minutes for photographs last week - their line was the same. \"It just doesn't stack up,\" says Bennett, pointing out that the lifestyle craze started long ago, when the BBC's executive line-up was almost exclusively male. \"It's a very narrow and patronising idea that gender equals certain interests. You can't correlate it. It's a pretty crazy notion.\" </p> <p>Heggessey is fizzing too: \"If another woman were to take over BBC1 she would commission different shows. Everybody is an individual with their own background and preferences. We are not a homogeneous group.\" Bennett and Heggessey point to their somewhat masculine route to the top. They started as news trainees: Heggessey later moved to Newsnight and Panorama, while Bennett went via Newsnight to documentaries and science. And while both say they never felt blocked because of their gender, both certainly felt the pressures of a male-dominated industry. Heggessey encountered it early on in her training, on attachment to the newsroom at what was then called Radio Birmingham (now WM), where the big story at the time was industrial unrest at the Longbridge car plant. </p> <p>\"They clearly thought I was some jumped-up graduate trainee who knew nothing about life or anything else, so I was immediately sent on my first day to vox-pop workers leaving Longbridge. They thought I would come back with nothing and I would be made mincemeat of. Of course I was determined to come back with something - and men didn't mind stopping to talk to me in those days. So I came back with a tape that they ran. But whatever you did, there was some sort of test, and if you passed the test you were OK.\" </p> <p>When Bennett was editor of the science series Horizon, she had particular difficulty with magazine subscriptions: \"Every month a brown envelope arrived, addressed to the editor, containing a copy of Health and Efficiency, which obviously previous male editors had thought was an essential source of scientific stories. I had a lot of trouble cancelling the subscription, because nobody could quite work out who had authorised it in the first place.\" </p> <p>But pockets of sexism aside, the pair flourished under successive regimes, rising through the ranks as well as taking time out to have children. Both have spent time outside the BBC - Heggessey on This Week at Thames and Bennett in the US at Discovery. And now they are back, and at the forefront of the firing line. </p> <p>For Heggessey, it is something of a change of fortunes. The first two or three years of her controllership were characterised by positive headlines, as she guided BBC1 to the top of the ratings charts, overtaking ITV1 for the first time, reviving the cash-starved and somewhat beleaguered flagship network. But the populism came at a price: arts and current affairs marginalised, so the critics said, at the expense of factual entertainment and factory-line drama. More EastEnders, more Holby City, more DIY SOS. Then came Hutton, the departure of Greg Dyke, the arrival of the charter review process and a new regulatory regime under Michael Grade. A review of BBC1 ordered, cue more critical headlines. The Guardian suggested at one point that her job could be on the line - although it is now clear that she has, and continues to enjoy, the full support of Bennett and director general Mark Thompson. \"She is in the hot seat, not the ejector seat,\" Thompson said, memorably. </p> <p>Yet the critics are not going away. The charge sheet was put, polemically, by Ben Summerskill, formerly of the Observer and now chief executive of the gay lobby group Stonewall. Writing in the Guardian last week, in a piece headed \"Heggessey's legacy - prime-time pap\", he said: \"Just like a Holloway inmate who finds religion shortly before a parole hearing, the BBC has recently presented us with a spate of programmes on general knowledge, healthy eating and the restoration of old buildings. But for every piece of public-spirited philanthropy, there's an accompanying piece of unalloyed dross.\" </p> <p>Heggessey was furious. \"Of course nothing's perfect but if you take drama, did nobody see May 33rd, a highly authored piece about an extremely rare psychiatric condition; didn't they see England Expects, which was about a man who'd belonged to the far right? Didn't they see Holy Cross, about the school in Belfast; didn't they see Dirty War? We've done a lot of hard-hitting single dramas and we've also done some successful popular drama. And everybody acts as if successful popular drama is easy, it's actually the most difficult thing to do, to get people coming back week after week after week after week. To actually have a renaissance of drama on BBC1 in such a crowded market has been a tremendous achievement.\" </p> <p>Summerskill had a go at \"high-spending Heggessey\" for failing to find something for Graham Norton to do, despite hiring him on a multimillion pound swoop from Channel 4. Another raw nerve. \"People have said that it's not nurturing talent. But giving existing talent the chance to go on to the next level is as important as taking on new talent. We're going to do that with Graham, and go on a journey with him. We've done it with Jonathan Ross. To move to the broad family audience is a big step up for him. I think he will be a big mainstream entertainment name of the future, but you have to gamble. And the difficulty with BBC1 is that you do everything in the spotlight.\" </p> <p>And the spotlight is bright: \"Most people can do their jobs, even if they run a FTSE 100 company, and they don't go home or go to a dinner party and have someone give them their view on how they do their job. Everybody I meet has a view on how I run BBC1. Every columnist has a view.\" </p> <p>Particularly columnists who don't earn as much as Heggessey (salary undisclosed) or Bennett (a little north of \u00a3300k according to this year's annual report). </p> <p>In response, both claim the range of programmes on BBC1 is greater than ever before: Heggessey says the channel now has programmes in 17 different genres. There's anthropology on a Sunday night with Michael Palin's Himalaya; geology midweek with Alan Titchmarsh's British Isles. There was ancient history with Pompeii (and more to come on the \"real history\" front with Krakatoa and Hiroshima next in line). Arts are back with Imagine; current affairs on form with Question Time and Andrew Neil's This Week. \"If you look at BBC1 it has more variety and more range than 10 years ago. Our own home-grown British drama has replaced the Dallases and Dynasties,\" says Bennett. </p> <p>But still the dumbing down cry goes up. Just as the governors are demanding that current affairs be \"restored to prominence\" in prime-time on BBC1, there was that timely leak to the Guardian of a \"creative brief\" saying Panorama was too \"difficult and didactic\" and should be popularised with subjects inspired by EastEnders storylines and soft-soap interviews conducted by Fiona Bruce. Bennett says it's work in progress, but it doesn't sound like she was mightily impressed with much of the Panorama document, compiled by former BBC3 current affairs editor Colin Savage. \"We want to find ways of having current affairs reach the audience and that's got to be the guiding principle, as well as having fantastic journalism and not dumbing down. Which is why that 'leaked document' had some ideas in it of ... [pause to raise eyebrows] ... very differing merits.\" But it had, surely, a few good ideas? Another pause. \"A few. Some of it I wouldn't go there in a million years.\" </p> <p>The future, says Bennett, is \"upping the ante\", particularly on BBC1. Heggessey agrees: more, bigger, better. But she adds a rider: \"I suspect that to make it better we will need a bit more money and I don't know if the BBC will have any more money.\" </p> <p>The corporation already spends \u00a31bn on BBC1 and it may not be politically acceptable to spend any more. The future will also, almost certainly, be bigger and better for the two friends who met 25 years ago. It is known that Bennett considered applying for the director general's job after Dyke left, but felt it was too soon. Heggessey has said in the past that she would do \"something else\", outside the BBC, when she moved on from BBC1. </p> <p>Whatever, these are two ambitious, energetic and serious people. And whatever the merits of the dumbing down argument, these are not dumb women. Heggessey says: \"I find it extraordinary that I'm portrayed as some sort of fluffy dimwit when even to survive as a producer on Panorama was incredibly tough and lots of people fell by the wayside. I did more than survive.\" </p> <p>Through the glass ceiling</p> <p><strong> Jana Bennett </strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 48 </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Oxford and London School of Economics, specialising in defence studies. </p> <p><strong> BBC career:</strong> Joined as a news trainee in 1979 and worked on Nationwide, The Money Programme and Newsnight, moving to be a producer of Panorama in 1986.

  "<p>With the most dramatic gesture of a largely undistinguished final, Ernie Els holed a 20ft birdie putt on the 35th green of the HSBC World Match Play Championship to win the event for a record sixth time. In beating Lee Westwood by 2&amp;1 he not only won the \u00a31m first prize, he overtook the five-times winners Severiano Ballesteros and Gary Player and took to \u00a33,005,000 his total winnings in 10 of these events. </p> <p>Moreover, the South African won on what was his 35th birthday, having won his first as a 24-year-old when the top money was \u00a3160,000. </p> <p>Els acknowledged that the golf had not been great. He was only four under for 35 holes and said: \"I won more with grit than with flair. Also I know Lee got a little bit sick at lunchtime, which was good for me.\" </p> <p>It transpired that the Englishman was suffering from a chest infection and, as he admitted, \"ran out of steam\" over the closing holes. \"I've got a virus as well,\" he said. \"It's in my ears and I felt that I had no balance, felt that I was moving all over the place, which is not the best thing when you are putting.\" </p> <p>Els, who came close to winning three majors this year and won none, said: \"Three weeks ago I was complaining about all kinds of stuff, but now I have won twice in that time and it has become a great season.\" He won the American Express World Golf Championship in Ireland three weeks ago, making this week's win his fifth worldwide this year. He also tied up the Volvo Order of Merit for the second successive year with a record \u20ac4,061,903 (\u00a32.8m). </p> <p>\"To win six of these things,\" he said of the Match Play, \"is a brilliant feeling. I know how Lee feels at this moment - I've been there and it's not nice.\" </p> <p>Asked why he was so successful in this format, Els agreed that he loved match play. As he has now played 26 matches and lost only four of them, few could quibble. </p> <p>Els, not at anything like his imperious best all week, had to resort to grinding out pars wherever he could and, given that he had five bogeys in yesterday morning's round, hope he could counteract them with enough sub-par scores to salvage respectability. In fact he got round in 70, only two under, and that was a score which contained two eagles, at the long 4th and 12th holes, both of them in reach with a mid iron off a good drive. </p> <p>Westwood, who at times had been quite brilliant in this tournament and began the final with an aggregate of 32 under par, compared with Els's 21, also struggled yesterday. His morning 69 was good enough only for all square at lunch. He had been better than that in beating all three of his previous opponents, the Open champion Todd Hamilton, the US Open champion Retief Goosen and the four-times winner this year Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez. In many ways Westwood, despite Els's illustrious record in this event, was the form horse for the final, but the golf that had got him there was not with him when he needed it most. </p> <p>The South African made the first moves, holing a 10-foot birdie putt at the 3rd and then one from 11 feet at the next for an eagle. Westwood produced a great response at the short 5th, hitting a five-iron to two feet, and then got a good break at the 7th where, after unwisely taking too much club off the tee, he ran through the fairway and on to a bridge crossing a water hazard. One of golf's more arcane rules allowed him to ground his club on the bridge, even though it was within the hazard marking lines (Note to Rule 13-4 applies), and he saved a par and a half. </p> <p>The Englishman was only one down at the start of the back nine and, given that he was a total of 22 under for the homeward half and Els only 11, had reason to hope. But he missed the green at the short 10th and found the trampled grass and mud of a spectator area, and that was two down. </p> <p>Now was not the time to make any mistakes but Westwood did at the long 12th where, after Els was in the trees from the tee and always taking five at best, the Englishman could not get his birdie from a relatively easy position in a greenside bunker. </p> <p>Still two down after 14 and needing to make something happen, Westwood hit his best shot of the day at the 15th, a towering eight-iron which dropped down and stopped dead only two feet from the hole. It won him the hole, but another mistake at the next effectively cost him the match. From the 16th fairway he hit his second so hard that he imparted an enormous amount of spin, so although the ball pitched six feet from the hole it finished some 30 feet away. He ran that putt six feet past the hole before missing the one back and, at two down with two to play, found himself almost without hope. </p> <p><strong>Winning ways - six times over</strong></p> <p><strong> 1994</strong></p> <p> <strong> Seve Ballesteros 2&amp;1, Jose Maria Olazabal 2&amp;1, Colin Montgomerie 4&amp;2</strong> </p> <p>Marked debut by toppling Ballesteros, who had seven twos in their memorable game, and Olazabal before repeating his US Open win over Montgomerie. </p> <p><strong> 1995 </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Lee Janzen 4&amp;3, Bernhard Langer 1 hole, Steve Elkington 3&amp;1</strong> </p> <p>Was 12 under against Janzen, his predecessor as US Open champion, seven under against Langer, and then six under against the reigning US PGA champion Elkington. </p> <p><strong> 1996 </strong> </p> <p><strong>Steve Stricker 1 hole, Mark Brooks 10&amp;8, Vijay Singh 3&amp;2</strong> </p> <p>Came from six down with 16 to play to beat Stricker, achieved the tournament's third biggest win against Brooks, and then came from two down in the final. </p> <p><strong> 2002</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Colin Montgomerie 6&amp;5, Vijay Singh 3&amp;2, Sergio Garcia 2&amp;1</strong> </p> <p>Created tournament record with an opening 60, 12 under par, against Montgomerie and never trailed all week.

  "<p>\"I feel like I am the strongest man in the world,\" Vitali Klitschko says earnestly, just a few moments after the giant Ukrainian, all 6ft 8in and 18 stone of him, has taken my hand in his meaty mitt and crushed it with a deceptively amiable squeeze. \"This is because I am heavyweight champion of the world. I feel very strong. I feel very powerful.\" </p> <p>We perch together on a relatively tiny settee. A crick in my neck replaces the throb in my hand as I tilt my head back to take in the imposing view. Klitschko is so high, wide and impassive he looks more like a building than a man. I make a point of eyeballing him in a dismal attempt to prove that I have a head for heights and a perspective on his place in the pantheon of heavyweight boxing. And then, realising that he is grinning down at me, I shuffle an inch to my left to give the big guy just a little more room on our creaking two-seater. </p> <p>Klitschko has the kind of physique which makes boxing old-timers nod sagely as they hail \"a magnificent specimen\". It is, of course, an ambivalent description. Specimens, even magnificent ones, are not renowned as fighters - just as a breeze-block of a man is never going to be much of a mover around the ring. Klitschko, in terms of pure size, dwarfs his legendary predecessors - from Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis to Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali. He is bigger, taller, heavier and probably stronger. </p> <p>Yet it was hard not to think of those past great heavyweights last Thursday when Klitschko trudged into central London to announce the first defence of his WBC crown. On December 11, probably in the boxing heartland of Las Vegas, Klitschko will take his belt into the ring against Danny Williams, the sweetly sensitive Brixton fighter who destroyed Mike Tyson less than three months ago. It promises to be a more than decent fight between a competent champion in Klitschko and an enigmatic challenger in Williams. However, while the press conference filled a large room in a swanky hotel, there was little of the sheer fizz and exhilarating sense of danger which once defined the build-up to any genuine heavyweight title contest. </p> <p>The days when the heavyweight championship of the world could be legitimately described as the greatest prize in sport have long since faded. But boxing, now in the deepest pit of an enduring malaise, desperately requires a heavyweight who can drag the battered old game at least briefly back up on centre stage whenever he steps inside the ring. </p> <p>Alone with me in a room in London the task seems beyond him. \"It is too much,\" he concedes. \"I know there is trouble in boxing. People say it is no longer good. But I cannot take responsibility. I am not a missionary for boxing.\" </p> <p>With his PhD in sports science from Kiev University and an ability to speak four languages, Klitschko, the son of a colonel in the old Soviet air force, is not a typical world heavyweight title-holder. Only Gene Tunney - a highly educated fighter capable of hanging out with George Bernard Shaw and beating Dempsey - could claim a vaguely similar academic background. And yet Klitschko has none of the magnetic or hypnotic aura of past champions. </p> <p>\"This is a decision for boxing experts and fans,\" he says graciously. \"I can just do it my way. I can just be myself.\" </p> <p>It is a perfectly reasonable and intelligent response. And yet his \"strongest man\" claim made me remember some famously evocative if absurdly romantic words Norman Mailer once wrote: \"The heavyweight champion of the world is either the toughest man in the world or he is not, but there is a real possibility that he is. It is like being the big toe of God . . . when the heavyweights become champions they begin to have inner lives like Hemingway or Dostoevsky, Tolstoy or Faulkner, Joyce or Melville, or Conrad or Lawrence or Proust.\" </p> <p>It is impossible to imagine Mailer being entranced by Klitschko - as he was by Louis, Sonny Liston and, most of all, Ali. Even compared with a lower tier of previous champions, Klitschko is a hulking but ultimately limited boxer. And too few people really care about his next fight, let alone his \"inner life\". </p> <p>His impact is diminished further by a lack of credible opposition. When I ask him to look beyond Williams and pick out a fighter who would present him with his next great challenge, Klitschko is silent for 10 seconds. It is, presumably, his way of lamenting the retirement of Lennox Lewis, the utter destruction of Tyson and the recent collapse of the once-brilliant Roy Jones Jr, who rose from the middleweight ranks to seize a portion of the heavyweight crown in 2002. </p> <p>\"Who would you like to fight?\" I ask again. The quiet deepens and then, almost helplessly, Klitschko shakes his head. \"I think . . . maybe Danny Williams?\" </p> <p>The British fighter may be just too likeable ever to become a compelling presence but he will at least bring some intrigue and uncertainty to the ring in December. The once mentally fragile Williams withstood an opening round of untrammeled fury and murderous punching from Tyson to win by a fourth-round knockout in one of the great sporting stories of the year. </p> <p>\"Danny Williams broke my dream,\" Klitschko says with a trace of bitterness. \"Iron Mike, for me, was the dream. For many years I would see Tyson and say, 'Mike, I want to fight you.' He was on his way back and we were making conversation about a fight between me and him. So I was very surprised and disappointed when he lost. Everyone underestimated Danny Williams but I won't make that mistake. I was very impressed. He has hard punching, fast hands, good technique and a very big heart.\" </p> <p>Williams once won a 12-round British title fight after, early on, he had badly dislocated his shoulder. His left arm simply popped out of its socket and dangled horribly at his side. He boxed on through the agony and widely outpointed his opponent Mark Potter. Klitschko, in contrast, was ridiculed for years after he \"quit\" on his stool against Chris Byrd in 2000. The fact that Klitschko had been persuaded to retire by a ringside doctor who correctly diagnosed a torn rotor-cuff muscle failed to stem the derision. Larry Merchant, the doyen of American boxing analysts, sneered that Klitschko \"has no balls\". It was a jibe which haunted the Ukrainian for three years until, despite losing for a second time, he showed astonishing bravery and resilience against Lewis last June. </p> <p>\"They say bad things about me in America before I fight Lewis. But against Byrd the doctor say, if you go on, your career is finished. The surgeon who operated said it was the worst kind of injury. I am very lucky to be able to box again. So I'm happy that, after the Lewis fight, no one can say anything like this about me again.\" </p> <p>After hurting Lewis in three of the first four rounds Klitschko was ahead 58-56 on all the judges' scorecards when a doctor intervened again. Klitschko shouted \"no, no!\" in angry defiance but, after brutal fifth and sixth rounds in which he and Lewis went to war, his face was a hideous mask of deep and bloody cuts. The worst ran along the length of his left eyelid. One more brutal blow would have severed the lid completely and potentially caused blindness. It was a completely justifiable stoppage. Sixty-eight stitches were needed to seal the wounds. </p> <p>Klitschko rubs his face gently, as if trying to comfort himself. \"I have experience of boxing. I know what it is like to be hit. Half my life is boxing. I start fighting when I am 16. I am now 33. But I never take so many punches like I did in that one fight. I know before we go into the ring that this will not be like two children playing but I have never been hit like that. It was the toughest fight of my career. I get hurt but, that night, it don't matter if Lennox Lewis has a baseball bat in the ring. He was never going to knock me out. Before that fight I never have one cut. I had six big cuts against Lewis. But I hurt him much more than he hurt me. I won that fight. But he got the doctor's decision.\" </p> <p>Lewis, while looking old, dug into the dark depths of himself to prevail. He would surely have dealt with Klitschko far more effectively if he had been a few years younger. Yet now, at the age of 39, even the prospect of another multi-million dollar bonanza is unlikely to persuade the sensible former champion out of retirement. </p> <p>\"Lennox is too intelligent to come back. He plays chess, like me, and he study this situation. Why should he go into the ring with me again? He is a very big champion. He is recognised all over the world and he is very rich. Why would he risk all this by fighting me again? He is too smart.\" </p> <p>Lewis has taken to advising Klitschko's subsequent opponents: the South African Corrie Sanders, whom Klitschko stopped in eight rounds to win the vacant WBC title in April, and now Williams. \"Lewis was Sanders' promoter and adviser. Sanders gave me a good fight but Lewis couldn't help him beat me. Now I hear Lewis telling Williams he must go for the cuts again or attack my body. But my face is healed and my body is strong. </p> <p>\"You know, I like London very much. I like Great Britain very much. And Danny Williams will be the third British boxer I fight. But I tell you something. In 1999 I knock out Herbie Hide and last year I send Lewis to retirement. Williams is next. Our fight will be a real heavyweight battle. I know he is hungry to be world champion but I will win. And then, I hope, we can speak of unification.\" </p> <p>Sharing a claim as heavyweight champion with Klitschko are the uncharismatic Byrd and two journeymen in John Ruiz and Lamon Brewster who, respectively, hold the IBF, WBA and WBO belts. Klitschko is indisputably the most plausible of the quartet but, as he admits, he champions a far weaker, more fractured and darkly troubled boxing world than that which his gleaming hero dominated. </p> <p>\"When me and my brother were small boys, professional boxing was banned in the Soviet Union. The only fighter they allowed to be seen on television was Muhammad Ali. This was because of his political views which gave speculation about America. And wherever we travelled with my father - because he moved from one military camp to another in countries like Kazakhstan and Kurdistan - we follow Muhammad Ali. </p> <p>\"He was incredible. All our friends love Ali. We all dream of somehow becoming like him. So it is unbelievable I am world champion. But everything has changed. Boxing is different. The world is different. I am not Muhammad Ali. I can only try to be the best champion we have now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Valentino Rossi tore motorcycling's record books to shreds when he won the Australian MotoGP here yesterday. The 25-year-old Italian claimed his sixth world title and gave Yamaha the championship for the first time in 12 years. </p> <p>It was his 100th podium performance and also his fourth consecutive championship in the premier class of grand prix racing. Further, he became only the second rider in the 55-year history of grand prix racing to win back-to-back championships in the senior class on different makes of motorcycle. And his eighth victory of the year broke the record for the number of premier-class wins in a season by a Yamaha rider. </p> <p>\"That was my best ever championship,\" Rossi said after beating Honda's Sete Gibernau in a blazing 27-lap tussle on this 2.76-mile circuit near Melbourne. \"We used a very hard rear tyre and it was a great choice. I made a bit of a bad start but I wanted to stick with Sete. When my fuel load dropped I got a good feeling from the bike, and in some places on the track I was faster than him. </p> <p>\"The last lap was incredible. I overtook him going into the first corner and then we passed each other two or three more times I don't remember exactly.\" </p> <p>Rossi's frantic struggle for his 67th race win was totally unnecessary because he needed only to finish second to clinch the title. But it is a tribute to his competitive nature that he declined to play it safe and gave the 42,000 spectators one of the closest races of the season. </p> <p>Gibernau finished less than a tenth of a second behind but was totally dismayed at finishing runner-up to Rossi in the championship for the second consecutive year. </p> <p>\"I struggled for the whole race with a problem with my throttle control,\" he said. \"I had to anticipate what was happening with the throttle and I couldn't just focus on pushing hard to win.\" </p> <p>Loris Capirossi revived the fortunes of Italy's Ducati Marlboro team by finishing third on the factory's revised twin-pulse Desmosedici V4 machine. </p> <p>The flair with which Rossi dominates MotoGP racing has made him the outstanding rider of his era and a rival to the sixties legend, the late Mike Hailwood, for the accolade of the greatest racing motorcyclist of all time. </p> <p>\"Rossi [is] probably the greatest rider in history,\" the former world champion Wayne Gardner said yesterday. \"He is a great world champion, a great professional and an entertainer. It's not often you see someone who is that good on and off the track.\" </p> <p>Rossi won his three previous championships in MotoGP's senior class with Honda but switched to Yamaha during the winter for a new challenge. </p> <p>Without any support from the three other Yamaha riders on the grid he has thrashed six Honda riders this year, including the former world champions Max Biaggi and Colin Edwards. He now carries an unassailable 35-point lead into the final round in Spain on October 31. </p> <p>Yesterday was the 10th time that Rossi's crew chief, the Australian Jerry Burgess, has steered a team to a world title. Honda's only consolation was to take the constructors' championship for the 16th time, equalling the record held by the Italian maker MV Agusta. </p> <p>Britain's Chaz Davies, 17, scored the best result of his grand prix career with sixth place in the 250cc race.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Smith may be an Australian but the Leeds coach had enough knowledge of English football to appreciate the significance of the setting for the Rhinos' first grand final triumph. </p> <p>Before the kick-off Smith had compared Leeds's long wait since their last Championship success in 1972 to the 26-year drought Manchester United endured before winning the first Premier League title in 1993. </p> <p>Around an hour after Kevin Sinfield had lifted the Super League trophy Smith pointed to the empty stadium behind him and highlighted another similarity between Alex Ferguson's history-makers and the 2004 Rhinos. </p> <p>\"Most successful teams that go on and on to be victors usually produce their own players,\" he said. \"Man U have done it for years and years. So it's important that most of our blokes are homegrown. That's a great credit to the work that's been going on at the Leeds club for a long time now and a great sign for what could happen in the future.\" </p> <p>For Butt, Giggs, Scholes and the Nevilles, read Ryan Bailey, Chev Walker, Mark Calderwood, Richie Mathers and the inevitable grand final glory boy Danny McGuire, who wriggled over for the try that finally made the game safe five minutes from the end - his 38th of the Super League season. </p> <p>The substitute Jamie Jones-Buchanan made it six members of the Rhinos' 17 who were born in Leeds, and another four were spotted and signed as schoolboys - Sinfield in Oldham and Rob Burrow in Featherstone while Danny Ward and the man of the match Matt Diskin are still known at Headingley as the Dewsbury mafia. </p> <p>There are plenty more on the way, with Leeds providing nine of the England Under-18s squad who made history by beating the Australian Schoolboys in their own backyard earlier this year. </p> <p>Leeds are also British rugby league's financial equivalent of United. The Rhinos have averaged crowds of almost 17,000 this season, allowing them to claim to be the most popular rugby club of either code in the land, and the potential for further growth will be underlined by a likely 40,000 sell-out at Elland Road for the World Club Challenge against Canterbury Bulldogs, Australia's champions, early next year. </p> <p>But Smith's United analogy does not extend to the coach himself. His surprising appointment midway through last season, with the former Great Britain international Daryl Powell agreeing to step back to a position as director of rugby even though the Rhinos were then top of the table, was on the understanding that Smith would make way for Powell to resume first-team control at the end of 2005. </p> <p>Both Smith and the Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington dismissed suggestions that Saturday night's result would change that arrangement and provoke a Ferguson-style change of heart. </p> <p>\"I've always been happy that I'm only here for two years and if, we back this up with more trophies next season, I should be able to find another job OK,\" joked Smith. He has always seen success in Britain as a stepping stone to fulfilling his career ambition of following his older brother Brian, a former Bradford coach himself, by taking charge of a club in Australia's National Rugby League, so two successful years with Leeds would suit him perfectly. </p> <p>But it is Hetherington who deserves more credit than anyone for Leeds's current success. As the prop Barrie McDermott put it pithily last week, \"the club was on the way to becoming a Tesco's,\" after initially opposing rugby league's switch to summer - because of the clash with cricket at Headingley - and then sulking through the first Super League season. </p> <p>Hetherington, a former York hooker and double glazing salesman who had established the Sheffield Eagles with his wife Kath in the early 80s, was brought in by the property developer Paul Caddick to sort out the mess late in 1996. </p> <p>By the start of the following season Leeds had become the Rhinos, and enthusiastic advocates of the summer Super League, following the example set by Bradford over the previous 18 months. They then signed Iestyn Harris from Warrington, appointed Graham Murray as coach and followed defeat by Wigan in the first grand final in 1998 by thrashing London Broncos at Wembley to win the Challenge Cup the following year. </p> <p>But, when Murray returned to Australia, Leeds reverted to under-achievement, which shows the danger of assuming that years of United-style success will automatically follow now. </p> <p>Even Saturday's result could easily have been different, with Harris, now of Bradford, unlucky to be penalised for stealing the ball from Willie Poching late in the first half - a decision which allowed Sinfield to kick his third goal and give the Rhinos a 10-4 lead. </p> <p>Leeds were also lucky that Paul Deacon failed to convert either of Bradford's tries, from Lesley Vainikolo and Shontayne Hape early in each half, and that Sinfield was not penalised when he appeared to impede Lee Radford in a position from which Deacon would surely have brought the Bulls level at 10-all in the 59th minute. </p> <p>Instead the Rhinos preserved their narrow advantage and Bradford, forced to chase the game, continued to make mistakes which allowed Leeds to stay on top. It was a tribute to the Bulls' defence, in which Jamie Peacock's effort was phenomenal, that it took until the 75th minute, and Robbie Paul's fatal fumble, for McGuire to provide the one lasting memory of a dour Yorkshire battle - which will nevertheless be unforgettable for long-suffering Leeds. </p> <p> <strong> Bradford Bulls:</strong> Withers; Reardon, Johnson, Hape, Vainikolo; Harris, Deacon; Vagana, Paul, Fielden, Radford, Peacock, Swann. <strong> Substitutes:</strong> Anderson, Pratt, Langley, Parker. </p> <p><strong> Tries: </strong> Vainikolo, Hape. </p> <p><strong> Leeds Rhinos: </strong> Mathers; Calderwood, Walker, Senior, Bai; Sinfield, McGuire; Bailey, Diskin, Ward, Lauitiiti, McKenna, Furner. <strong> Substitutes:</strong> Burrow, McDermott, Poching, Jones-Buchanan. </p> <p><strong> Tries:</strong> Diskin, McGuire. <strong> Goals:</strong> Sinfield 4. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> S Ganson (St Helens). </p> <p><strong> Attendance:</strong> 65,537.</p>",
  "<p>Jonny Wilkinson has not lost his gift for last-minute drama. The golden boy saved Newcastle Falcons with the final kick of yesterday's match, taking a short pass and swinging his left boot crisply through the ball in a single action to slot the drop-goal that secured a precious draw with Saracens. A dozen minutes earlier, however, he had silenced his home crowd when he rose from a tackle and suddenly bent double, his left hand clutching his rigid right arm in a manner all too familiar to those who have followed his remarkable career. </p> <p>Four weeks before he is due to make his first appearance at Twickenham as the successor to Lawrence Dallaglio England's new captain was showing that the question of his physical fitness is by no means fully resolved. The operation to widen a nerve channel and remove a bone spur last February kept him out of the game for eight months but has not, it appears, totally eradicated the \"stingers\" - the deadening of an arm - that he has suffered intermittently since the age of 14. </p> <p>None of this has reduced Wilkinson's obsession with becoming a better rugby player. On Wednesday he was desperate to watch England's match in Azerbaijan but a couple of missed kicks in training kept him out on the pitch at Kingston Park, the floodlights blazing down on his lonely toil while his team-mates clustered around the television in the clubhouse. And in the England squad's most recent set of fitness examinations, conducted at Loughborough College, he came top in every test, breaking the record in several disciplines. </p> <p>But shining in tests in a gym is not the same as surviving in the environment of true competition. A week ago, in Newcastle's defeat at Wasps, his right shoulder made contact with Joe Worsley's head and the blow numbed the arm. He recovered quickly enough and in yesterday's programme notes he issued an assurance that all was well while acknowledging the existence of a haematoma close to the muscles he has been trying to build up. </p> <p>\"Thankfully none of the pain has been anywhere near my neck, where I was injured before,\" he said. \"The neck is stronger than it's ever been and the way it's working with my shoulder now means I'm less susceptible to the sort of pains I was getting before. The severe pain has stopped and, even though there is the odd tingle here and there, it's just down to bad luck. I had pain for years and years and what's great now is that I can move my neck in ways I never could before. The shooting pains are all gone. That's exactly what the operation was for and what the rehab was aimed at, so I'm back to how I should be.\" </p> <p>His optimism will not have extinguished the hopes of England's opponents in the forthcoming series of autumn internationals. The coaches of Canada, South Africa and Australia will have heard the news from Newcastle's last two league fixtures and begun to hatch plans to target English rugby's 25-year-old superstar. </p> <p>For the Springboks, in particular, there will be the dark memory of the equivalent match at Twickenham two years ago. On that occasion their calculated violence availed them nothing as they took a deserved pasting, but a particularly brutal late tackle from Butch James, their centre, provided the first evidence of the physical risks Wilkinson would run on the path to the World Cup final. </p> <p>In Australia a year later he smashed into two tackles that produced similar results, first on Imanol Harinordoquy in the semi-final against France and then against Matt Giteau of Australia in the final itself. Those observers who felt that Wilkinson was sacrificing himself to ensure that England might win the game's supreme trophy will have seen nothing in recent weeks to dissuade them from a collateral belief that he may never be quite the same player again. </p> <p>Yesterday's injury was suffered when Wilkinson tried to halt Hugh Vyvyan, Saracens' No8, who had burst off the back of a five-yard scrum. After lengthy treatment Wilkinson trotted slowly back to his position and, in the second minute of injury-time, proved fit enough to provide the three points that enabled Newcastle to scramble a 20-20 draw. </p> <p>Yet again, however, his appetite for the physical side of the game had put him in harm's way. Never in the history of international rugby has a creative No10 so assiduously dedicated himself to the art of defence, to the point at which, during the World Cup finals, Clive Woodward felt that it was limiting his essential contribution to the team. </p> <p>\"Clive stressed that as the playmaker I was of no use to the side trapped under a pile of bodies at the bottom of a ruck,\" Wilkinson writes in his new book, My World. \"I could see the logic in what he said but it is difficult when you are right beside a tackled colleague - your first instinct is to go in and protect him and the ball. If I could be of use in a physical sense, I wanted to be there. It didn't come naturally to let others do the work.\" </p> <p>He has listened to the advice of those who think that his commitment to stopping opponents by physical force threatens to shorten his career and has rejected it. \"If I stepped back from making big hits, it would take away a lot of the enjoyment for me,\" he says. \"Whenever I watch a match, the thunderous tackles are the incidents I like best.\" </p> <p>Working with his fitness coach, Steve Black, he believes that he has used his convalescence to build himself into an even more formidable player. A man obsessed by setting targets and raising standards cannot bring himself to settle for anything less than constant improvement. </p> <p>Yesterday he kicked two touchline conversions and a penalty, in addition to the drop-goal. He made only one half-break but his distribution was excellent and his long passes to Epi Taione constituted Newcastle's most dangerous attacking ploy. He missed a couple of tackles but connected with rather more. \"He played very well today,\" Rob Andrew, his mentor and Newcastle's director of rugby, said afterwards. \"He defended brilliantly. There were a couple of loose kicks out of hand but he got us going in the second half from an attacking point of view and, with the score at 17-20 and 30 seconds on the clock, he popped over the drop-goal to save the draw.\" </p> <p>And the injury? \"There's a big bruise on his bicep. We'll have to see what the week brings.\" </p> <p>On a flight to Mauritius last February, heading for a post-operative holiday which was to be ruined by paparazzi stalking him and his girlfriend, Wilkinson made a list of short-term goals, something he tends to do when confronting a challenge. This time the usual stuff - pledges to improve his physical strength, to sharpen his skills and to watch his diet - ended with a more plaintive plea to new self: \"To enjoy playing the game of rugby a great deal more.\" Whether that enjoyment can be achieved without a further cost in pain is the big question for the next few weeks, and perhaps for the rest of his life. </p> <p><strong>How 12 months changed the life of English rugby's golden boy</strong></p> <p><strong> October 18, 2003</strong> </p> <p> England's World Cup pool match against South Africa in Perth 12 months ago was vital to their progress in the competition. Their 23-6 victory was emphatic with Wilkinson converting all his kicks at goal, while his Springbok counterpart Louis Koen flopped. </p> <p> <strong> November 22, 2003 </strong> </p> <p> Wilkinson's drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time against the world champions Australia at Sydney's Olympic Stadium confirms the fly-half's reputation as the hottest property in rugby union as Clive Woodward's men take the Webb Ellis trophy home in the most heart-stopping fashion imaginable. Wilkinson is later made an OBE. </p> <p> <strong> December 28, 2003</strong> </p> <p> Wilkinson makes his club comeback for Newcastle but it does not go to plan and his match against Northampton lasts only 53 minutes before he leaves the pitch with a recurrence of his neck and shoulder problems. He joins a list of 15 injured World Cup players. </p> <p> <strong> August 17, 2004</strong> </p> <p> Eight long months pass and Wilkinson makes a low-key return to action following surgery to repair nerve damage to his shoulder. The Newcastle No10 plays for half of their match against Connacht in Galway in front of a crowd of 4,000 which the Falcons win 32-9 and Wilkinson declares that the shoulder is fine. At the age of 25 his career is back on track. </p> <p> <strong> October 4, 2004</strong> </p> <p> England's new coach Andy Robinson announces, after a turbulent month in which Clive Woodward the captain Lawrence Dallaglio resign, that the fly-half is to be the country's new captain for Tests against Canada, South Africa and Australia. \"Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge,\" says Robinson.</p>",
  "<p>Norwich scrambled out of the relegation zone for the first time this season. But, as they have still to record a first victory, their escape must mainly be attributed to the current haplessness of Southampton and Blackburn. Yet, if City keep turning in performances like this, they will not have to rely on the shambolic largesse of others much longer. </p> <p>This was another solid display from Nigel Worthington's men, who dominated a listless West Bromwich Albion. Still it was an unrewarded one, and the manager knows what the problem is. \"We've got spirit and quality,\" he said, \"but the only thing we lack is clinical ruthlessness in front of goal. Finishing is all that we're missing. And that costs a lot of money.\" </p> <p>City's lack of firepower was betrayed three times in the first period. Matthias Jonson leapt on an exquisite Darren Huckerby through-ball but billowed the side netting. A deep Huckerby cross from the right took out the entire West Brom back line and fell to Leon McKenzie six yards out; the youngster spooned his volley wildly over the bar. Then, in the game's defining moment, McKenzie returned the favour, dispossessing Darren Moore and sending Huckerby clear: the resulting attempt to lift the ball over the advancing Russell Hoult was shanked horribly sideways. </p> <p>That ugly miss tarnished an otherwise perfect performance from Huckerby, of whom there seemed to be at least four on the pitch. He was everywhere: turning full-backs on either flank, chasing down lost causes, bustling through the centre at pace with tight close control, dropping deep to dictate the play, tackling back. His efforts meant Norwich enjoyed embarrassingly lengthy periods of possession, pinging passes prettily as West Brom struggled to get into the game. </p> <p>\"We were sluggish, leggy and off the pace,\" scowled the Albion manager Gary Megson, ruing the international break that robbed his side of the momentum gained by registering their first win of the season against Bolton. \"It's hard after two weeks off.\" </p> <p>And so it proved. Other than a searing Zoltan Gera volley that flashed across the face of goal, the greatest danger to the Norwich net came from one of their own. Just before half-time Gary Holt stuck out a leg to deflect a Bernt Haas cross and sent it arrowing towards the top corner; Robert Green clawed away. Green later had to smother a speculative shot from the lively substitute Robert Earnshaw but otherwise his was a quiet day. </p> <p>Less quiet were the boos to which West Brom left the field. \"It was our first clean sheet of the season,\" countered Megson, trying to salvage something from a disappointing match. </p> <p>Thoughts quickly turned to next week's trip to Crystal Palace. \"You need to win these games if you are going to pull away from the teams at the bottom,\" said Albion's midfielder Andy Johnson, \"and we will be going to Palace to get three points.\" On this evidence that is some agenda. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Darren Huckerby (Norwich City)</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool should be fearful they used up their month's quota of luck on Saturday, leaving none for tomorrow's visit of Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, but Rafael Ben\u00edtez could not see it. \"We keep the ball, we pass the ball, we control the game even in the first half,\" he said. This was whistling in the dark of the loot room. </p> <p>Two down at the interval, his band of expensive imports got a freakish own-goal just afterwards and another deflection from a free-kick to go ahead before Igor Biscan, butt of the Liverpool fans, came on in injury-time to score a fourth as Fulham went in head-shaking search of a saving point that should have been three. </p> <p>The equaliser was genuine, albeit through a defence with a stand-in centre-back in Carlos Bocanegra, who sounds like an amalgam of Verdi operas to which The Masked Ball might be added. Luis Garcia darted in to meet Xabi Alonso's cross with a flashing header that Edwin van der Sar could only push into the path of Milan Baros. </p> <p>Four goals cannot be gainsaid but Fulham, fragile in overall confidence despite two crisp and crackling goals, dropped their heads at the first riposte. Coupled with the arrival of Alonso at half-time, who brought cohesion and vision, it was enough to kid the manager that \"we played well\". </p> <p>Maybe the pleasure of a first league away win went to his head. It was also the first time for 13 years they have won from behind at half-time, the last being against Notts County, now 89th in the League. Times are changing at Anfield as well as Meadow Lane if they can seriously be content with this. </p> <p>Under G\u00e9rard Houllier Liverpool got stuck in a \"phase of plateau\" way below the summit marked out by Arsenal. Ben\u00edtez wants \"to go step by step\" from what he reckons is \"perhaps 60%\". If he is to get there in the next 10 years, he needs Steven Gerrard back, possibly now in three weeks, not only for his driving force but for his pedigree. Liverpool do not wear the international look well. On Saturday nine of the starting 11 were foreign, only Jamie Carragher local. </p> <p>Kicking the ball far and high is not the way. \"When the ball is up in the air, it's going to be very difficult to get it down again,\" said Graham Taylor, anticipating the tricky conditions in Baku last week, and he should know. For better or worse, gravity still applied at Craven Cottage. Time was when Liverpool could not bear to give the ball away. </p> <p>A sloppy pass by Salif Diao gave Fulham the first of two goals in quick order involving Steed Malbranque and Brian McBride, both converted by Luis Boa Morte. Malbranque's eye for the runner was the key in each case and Deportivo will have noted the squareness of Liverpool's defence. </p> <p>Malbranque is Fulham's catalyst and they may pick up the rhythms and triangles of last season's confidence when he and Sylvain Legwinski are fit to start in harness. McBride's intelligence, too, should not be left on the bench when Andy Cole is available again on Saturday after a four-match suspension, though Chris Coleman continues to prefer a disciplined 4-5-1 shape with midfielders bursting forward. </p> <p>The manager, at 34 still the youngest in the league, was in no mood to make excuses, conceding that the team's belief drained away after that own-goal. \"It's no good unless we are all at the races for 90 minutes,\" he said. \"There were two different performances but you can't crumble when you lose a goal. We started panicking. There was a lack of courage. If you start feeling sorry for yourselves, you're in real trouble.\" </p> <p>That, of course, is just what Fulham did after the Arsenal match (when a penalty was unawarded and another \"goal\" disallowed), behaving with puerile indignation and ill-discipline at The Hawthorns the week after, when Coleman, too, briefly dropped his guard of precocious maturity. With all their off-field distractions they could have done with kicking off this third start to the season on the right foot. </p> <p>Proceedings continue in the high court over the transfer of Steve Marlet and the part played by agents. When the club's owner Mohamed Al Fayed is not there, he is dodging Turks with alleged designs on an Ottoman Empire alongside the Roman one in south-west London, a slapstick with mischievous references to camels and kebabs. There is to be no immediate takeaway. </p> <p>Nor is Coleman to manage Wales, though Fayed, after his \"gift to the nation\" in the form of Kevin Keegan, could have completed a notable double with another to the principality. \"If I was to leave I'd be giving the chairman a slap in the face,\" he said. None of this can help Fulham keep their eye on the ball. </p> <p>Before kick-off, for National Anti-Racism Week, everyone in the crowd was asked to hold up a red card. Fulham have seen so many this season it hardly looked out of the ordinary. In the game it was Liverpool's Josemi who saw two yellows and a red, which presumably qualifies him for a brains trust.</p>",
  "<p>A Dutch referee was forced to stop the match between ADO The Hague and PSV Eindhoven on Saturday following racist chants from the home supporters. </p> <p>The official, Rene Timmink, halted the game in the 80th minute because of anti-semitic chants from the ADO fans. \"I think it's clear to everyone that a lot of borders were crossed,\" Timmink said. \"This is unacceptable.\" </p> <p>It is the first time a game has been abandoned following new legislation to clamp down on insulting chants and ADO now face playing their next two home matches behind closed doors. </p> <p>Messina's unbeaten start to the Serie A season ended with a 2-1 defeat to top-of-the-table Juventus. </p> <p>The Sicilians took a huge travelling support with them to the Stadio delle Alpi but, following unlikely victories over Milan and Roma, Bortolo Mutti's side fell just short of another upset. The Uruguayan striker Marcelo Zalayeta and Pavel Nedved struck either side of the break to give Fabio Capello's side their fifth win in six games. </p> <p>Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a warmed up for their Champions League encounter at Anfield tomorrow with a 2-1 win over Getafe despite resting several key players. Sergio and Victor were on target for the Galicians who now lie in fourth place in the Spanish league. </p> <p>Jiri Homola scored both goals in the Prague derby as Sparta, who host Manchester United tomorrow, defeated Slavia 2-0. </p> <p>Panathinaikos, who meet Arsenal in Athens on Wednesday, remain top of their domestic table despite seeing their winning run come to an end. The Greek champions were held to a 0-0 home draw by Egaleo, who will feel a little more confident before their tie against Middlesbrough in the Uefa Cup on Thursday. </p> <p>Chelsea's opponents in the Champions League on Wednesday, CSKA Moscow, kept the pressure on Russian League leaders FC Zenit St Petersburg with a 2-0 win over Rostov, while Shakhtar Donetsk, who travel to Celtic on the same night, enjoyed an easy 3-0 victory over Tavria Simferopol in the Ukrainian Cup quarter-finals. </p> <p>Panionios, who face Newcastle in the Uefa Cup, continued their disastrous start to the season, going down 2-0 to OFI Crete for their third defeat in four games, while Feyenoord, who face Hearts, won 2-0 against Roda JC to pull level with Dutch leaders PSV and Amica Wronki prepared for their tussle with Rangers with a 2-1 win over Wisla Plock.</p>",
  "<p>Fir Park proved a more productive venue for Rangers than it has in recent seasons as Dado Prso struck twice to help the Ibrox team stay in touch with the leaders Celtic. This was only Alex McLeish's second victory at the ground at which he began his managerial career and it was a vital one as Rangers look to continue their revival and make ground on their Glasgow rivals, who beat Hearts 3-0 at home on Saturday. </p> <p>It was also a timely boost ahead of what is effectively a trip into the unknown for their Uefa Cup tie against Amica Wronki in Poland on Thursday. \"They might have a strange name that people could have fun with but they won at the weekend to go second in their league and we will give them every respect,\" declared McLeish. </p> <p>The Rangers manager was heartened by Prso's performance ahead of the journey and his brilliant early goal was the highlight of a fascinating, if boisterous, first half. With just seven minutes gone the Croatian ran at an obligingly compliant home defence before deftly chipping a shot wide of Gordon Marshall. </p> <p>There was nothing between the teams for the rest of the half although Rangers's Stefan Klos did well to save from the impressive Scott McDonald and then David Clarkson, with the latter also shooting wide when more composure might have produced more. </p> <p>Prso missed an opportunity early in the second half before a fightback of sorts by Motherwell culminated in a Phil O'Donnell cross that begged for a touch but got none and Scott Leitch having a good effort well saved again by Klos. At the other end Marshall did likewise to Fernando Ricksen before another driving run at the heart of his defence, this time by Nacho Novo, created time and space for Prso to drill a shot past him and increase the deficit. </p> <p>After that Novo popped up on the line to clear a Ritchie Foran effort and ensure victory for Rangers from a fiercely contested affair - one in which Stevie Thompson, Chris Burke, Bob Malcolm and Novo were booked. </p> <p>\"I'm very happy with this win because Fir Park is a difficult place to come to as we've found out in the past,\" said McLeish. \"Sometimes you have to grind out results and we had to do that here.\" </p> <p>McLeish should have most of his squad available for the trip to Poland although there were brief fears that Novo had swallowed his tongue during this game but he merely bit it. Peter Lovenkrands should also be on the plane after a \"personal problem\" ruled him out here, as should Thompson who has a dead leg and Prso who has a thigh knock. </p> <p>Prso shrugged off his injury and declared himself pleased with his contribution before claiming he is now finding his feet in Scottish football. \"I watched a game in France on television the other day and the games there are so slow you could fall asleep but there is no time for that here.\" </p> <p>Terry Butcher, meanwhile, praised his players, insisting they matched Rangers in every department and that Klos was the only difference between the sides. </p> <p>\"I've played in front of goalkeepers like Chris Woods and Peter Shilton and Klos is up there; he is a considerable barrier,\" said the Motherwell manager. \"He made a number of excellent saves although I would still have preferred to have put him under even more pressure. Overall, though, I can't be too unhappy; we've come a long way in a short time.\" </p> <p><strong> Man of the match</strong>: Dado Prso (Rangers)</p>",
  "<p>Trust Craig Bellamy to enliven proceedings. The Welshman can often be relied upon to provide spark and his contributions yesterday came not just on the pitch but on his way off it. The Newcastle player would like his role here to be remembered only for the header with which he put his team ahead but will now have to account for his language when substituted. </p> <p>Bellamy was caught on television swearing as he walked towards the bench and his comments may have been directed at Graeme Souness rather than merely muttered in frustration at going off in the 67th minute. Souness will investigate because he did not hear anything. \"I will look at that,\" the manager said. \"I will ask if it was directed at me and tell you what happens.\" </p> <p>Bellamy was visibly upset when he saw his time was up. He had not played particularly well but had scored neatly at the near post and created one or two moments of danger for Charlton. The 25-year-old will have felt particularly aggrieved to be replaced by Shola Ameobi because this was the chance he has craved as a central striker. </p> <p>He has tended to play in midfield, where he is not happy, to accommodate Patrick Kluivert. But with the Dutchman injured he was allowed to partner Alan Shearer. Souness must judge whether Bellamy's comments justify disciplinary action. He noted that he was never delighted when taken off. </p> <p>\"I can understand players not being happy,\" he said. \"He's played two [international] games and lost two games. Psychologically and physically he's not at his best.\" Souness added: \"You have to be prepared to be substituted,\" but also said: \"I have never experienced anyone coming off and saying 'Thanks boss'.\" </p> <p>Souness would presumably have preferred to talk about a match which ended in open, entertaining fashion. If a draw was fair, it will also rankle with the visitors. \"When you are 1-0 up, you should see the game out,\" Shearer said. </p> <p>He added that an away point is always respectable but too many draws on their travels cost Newcastle a top-four finish last season. Twelve of their 19 away games ended all-square. They took an early lead at Birmingham in their last away game and that ended 2-2. </p> <p>Charlton are hardly easy to beat here, undefeated in nine home games, but failure to capitalise on winning positions has undermined New castle this season, particularly before Souness came. Shearer described as \"criminal\" the defending in the build-up to the Charlton equaliser, which saw Andy O'Brien hitting into his own net as he tried to clear Kevin Lisbie's goalbound shot. </p> <p>The final 20 minutes could have seen victory for either side. Shearer twice went close and also cleared off the line during a period in which Charlton hit the post and bar. \"I'm not disappointed because we have come here and shown great determination and got something,\" Souness said. </p> <p>No one epitomised that determination more than Shearer, who ended with blood on his shirt from a head wound. </p> <p>There were others on both sides who stood out. Shay Given twice saved Newcastle, a first-half stop from Graham Stuart particularly impressive. Lee Bowyer was full of energy on his return to his former club. He got forward on several occasions and had an effort ruled out for a foul. </p> <p>Charlton got strong performances not just from Chris Perry but their central midfielders Matt Holland and Danny Murphy. Holland showed his value on his first start since the opening day and Murphy looked to be getting back towards his best. </p> <p>A shame for Charlton is that Dennis Rommedahl has not yet settled. Murphy was Charlton's best hope before the interval as Newcastle looked the likelier scorers. A good move brought Bellamy's goal, the striker getting between Perry and Jon Fortune to meet an Olivier Bernard cross. </p> <p>Charlton were lifted by their equaliser, Lisbie beating O'Brien from Shaun Bartlett's flick and sidestepping Given for a shot which was directed in by O'Brien. </p> <p>With Charlton now passing better, they looked far more dangerous than earlier. Bowyer deflected a Rommedahl effort on to the bar and Holland hit a post. But it also required excellent blocks by Luke Young and Perry to deny Newcastle. </p> <p>Bellamy will need an equally effective defence in his discussions with Souness.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Shaw thought he did not have a part to play at Sheffield United, but now he has made a spectacular re-entrance. Two goals yesterday in familiar surroundings against his old club brought his total to four in three starts since he returned from exile on loan to Rotherham. </p> <p>With Ashley Ward injured and Andy Gray suspended, Shaw has finally been given an opportunity to play in a position that suits him better than the other roles he has understudied at Sheffield. </p> <p>\"He looks sharp,\" United's manager Neil Warnock acknowledged. \"He feels wanted again and his performances have shown that.\" </p> <p>Andy Hessenthaler never wanted him to leave Gillingham - \"We really miss him,\" the player-manager admitted this week - but this is a small club swimming in dangerous waters, and yesterday their Gills were hooked by the immutable law of the ex. </p> <p>This was their sixth successive home defeat, and it brutally exposed the brittleness of their confidence and resources. They had little to show for all their tidy work, apart from a gift of an own goal after United had lost their outstanding central defender Chris Morgan to a red card and a 30-yard volley from Adam Nowland that was bound for the top corner until Paddy Kenny demonstrated that he is more aerodynamic than he looks with an outstanding save. </p> <p>United have been having trouble scoring goals, but Gillingham soon fixed that. Most of the problems came down the left, where they presented their visitors with a series of opportunities, and Andy Liddell was too polite to decline them. </p> <p>Nyron Nosworthy put in a distracted performance at left-back, and Hessenthaler offered him ineffectual support, a shortcoming he acknowledged by rotating his diamond and moving himself into the Rooney role. By then his team was already one down. Liddell ran free to win a throw in, and Leigh Bromby launched a mortar into the box. Morgan headed on and Shaw volleyed in under little pressure. </p> <p>It was a soft goal, Hessenthaler's new assistant John Gorman admitted. \"It was just a big, old throw that we warned them about.\" </p> <p>Shaw had to wait 50 minutes for his second. Another Liddell cross found its way through to him, and this time Steve Banks could do nothing. </p> <p>Gillingham brought the former Wales winger John Robinson for his debut, but within eight minutes Alan Quinn opened them up again. Shaw's run shifted defenders from the far post, and Michael Tonge moved in to finish the move. </p> <p>Morgan was sent off with almost 20 minutes left, but United faltered only once. Nowland placed a short chip behind their back line, and Bromby obligingly beat Kenny with a diving header. </p> <p>\"We should shut up shop more,\" Warnock said. \"But you can't stop this lot sometimes.\" </p> <p>Naturally his biggest complaint was about the referee, Paul Armstrong, who he thought over-reacted when Morgan lost patience with Darius Henderson. \"It drives me daft,\" the manager said. \"He should have booked the other guy five times.\" </p> <p>Neither the red card nor the goal did much to change the current of the game, which flowed mostly in United's direction. Victory leaves them midway in the chasing pack but looking up, and Gillingham second from bottom looking down.</p>"
