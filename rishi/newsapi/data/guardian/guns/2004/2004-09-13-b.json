  "<p><strong>On to even higher things</strong></p> <p>Alan Johnson's non-graduate status didn't stop him getting on famously with vice-chancellors, who are still marvelling at the fact that he not only piloted the most controversial legislation of the Blair government through parliament but was actually promoted after being higher education minister. Some, such as Tessa Blackstone, have moved on sideways but most have found the job to be the kiss of death to their careers. Anorak question: who was the last higher education minister before Johnson to be promoted? At the weekend, not even vice-chancellors with long memories could remember.</p> <p><strong>Red Guard made good</strong></p> <p>And how will the vice-chancellors get on with Johnson's successor, Kim Howells - not just a graduate but a postgraduate and a former lecturer? His record with VCs is chequered. The notorious 1968 sit-in at Hornsey College of Art was organised at the flat of the student Howells (although he gave up painting as \"bourgeois individualism\"). Howells later commented: \"I was very keen on storming buildings; I really saw myself as a Red Guard when I went in and told the principal he had to leave his office.\" But with less than a year to go before the next election - and another minister for universities - there shouldn't be time for the outspoken Welsh former miner, who called rappers So Solid Crew \"idiots glorifying gun culture and violence\", to fall out with Ivor Crewe (no relation) and the rest at Universities UK.</p> <p><strong>Ivan leaves them standing</strong></p> <p>Not often we get a university press release saying the buildings are still standing - but last week there was that good news from St Georges University, Grenada, in the wake of Hurricane Ivan. The generator has been restarted, classes will resume in two weeks and no injuries are reported among the staff and students (who include 37 British medics and vet students). No looting or violence on campus. In a message to reassure anxious families, the chancellor, Charles Modica, says: \"There is a resourcefulness and dedication present today in the university community and there is no doubt that the outcome will be successful.\"</p>",
  "<p>Modern science tends to be a war of attrition, with every incremental advance the hard-won battle of years of lab work. Generally, but not always.</p> <p>Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys had his almost 20 years ago, in the very same lab at Leicester University where we are now talking. He's even holding the very same grainy X-ray containing the DNA profile of his research assistant, Jenny Foxon, and her mum and dad, that gave him his eureka moment. \"It was 9.05 in the morning,\" he says, \"and I was looking at these extremely variable patterns of DNA. My first reaction to the results was that they were far too complicated. Then the penny dropped.\"</p> <p>Jeffreys began working on gene evolution at Leicester in the late 1970s, and by 1980 his research was focused on a minisatellite section of human DNA, which appeared to show more dramatic variations than other strands. He was trying to trace genetic markers through families in order to better understand the inheritance patterns of illness. But on September 10 1984, Jeffreys realised he hadn't found the key to a medical problem. Quite by accident, he had solved another problem entirely. He had established the method of biological identification that would become known as genetic fingerprinting.</p> <p>Within minutes of this realisation, Jeffreys began brainstorming possible applications and rapidly came up with forensics, paternity testing, identical twins and wildlife classification. That night his wife Sue added another - resolving immigration disputes. Even so, it wasn't a done deal.</p> <p>\"There were two main challenges,\" Jeffreys says. \"You wouldn't have hanged a dog on the evidence of our first sample, so we had to find a way of improving the quality of the image. And then there was the question of whether anyone would pay the slightest attention to our work. I somehow instinctively felt it just wouldn't take off.\"</p> <p>It took just three months to tweak the radioactive processes to produce substantially clearer DNA patterns, and by the end of 1984 Jeffreys had filed patents for his discovery. Winning over the scientific establishment took a little longer. But not much.</p> <p>In March 1985, the journal Nature, ran the first in a series of four articles to appear that year and the press quickly sniffed an angle. \"I think it helped that I called the process genetic fingerprinting,\" Jeffreys laughs. \"If I'd called it something more scientifically accurate, such as 'idiosyncratic sudden block minisatellite hybridisation profiles', then I'm not sure it would have caught people's imagination.\"</p> <p>As a result of the press coverage, Jeffreys got a letter from a solicitor at the Hammersmith and Fulham Community Law Centre asking for help in resolving a two-year immigration case involving a Ghanaian boy who had been stopped from entering the country on a forged passport. \"I said yes, though I didn't hold out much hope,\" Jeffreys says.\"For one thing, there were still question marks over the statistical independence of the process and, for another, the case was enormously complicated. No one was sure whether the boy was the mother in question's son, nephew or was completely unrelated: to make matters worse, the mother was not sure who the father was.\"</p> <p>In fact, identification turned out to be a doddle. Jeffreys was able to prove that not only was the woman the boy's birth mother, but that the other children shared the same father. It was a legally defining moment for genetic fingerprinting, and before long the process had been used to establish both the innocence of a man suspected of the murders of two women, and the guilt of the actual perpetrator.</p> <p>After that the floodgates opened and Jeffreys' team was involved in countless cases, including the identification of the body of Josef Mengele and verifying the authenticity of Dolly, the cloned sheep. \"DNA has proved to be a remarkably stable substance,\" Jeffreys points out. \"It degenerates in hot, humid and acid environments, but the oldest DNA fingerprint we have taken is of an 80,000-year old Neanderthal man.\"</p> <p>It was all good fun, but by the mid-90s Jeffreys had begun to lose interest. The science had been solved and genetic fingerprinting had been turned into a hi-tech production issue which he was happy to hive off to ICI. Amid all the excitement, it had largely gone unnoticed that Jeffreys' original discovery had been the accidental by-product of blue-skies research - his first DNA sample had come from grey seal muscle bought from the British Antarctic Survey - and Jeffreys questions whether the current academic climate would have been so forgiving. \"I'm not arguing that something like the discovery of genetic fingerprinting couldn't happen today,\" he says, choosing his words carefully. \"But both science and funders require more applied work these days, so projects like mine are less easy to support.\"</p> <p>But not once you've achieved success. Jeffreys was keen to get back to studying the two basic processes of genetic diversity - mutation and recombinational crossing over - and Leicester University and the Royal Society were happy to let him write his own brief. So for the last 10 years, through the study of human sperm, he has been trying to understand how DNA is organised - an essential starting point for the analysis of common human diseases.</p> <p>Jeffreys has not been looking at specific applications - though these may well arise - but only last week one of his colleagues, Professor Yuri Dubrova, announced findings that may well have implications for families affected by radiation poisoning.</p> <p>What Jeffreys' research has taught him is that the \u00a362m UK Biobank project to collect DNA and lifestyle details from half a million people is likely to be an expensive waste of time and money. \"All you've got is a basic snapshot,\" he says. \"You can't do regular check-ups, you're reliant on notoriously unreliable hospital records and the sample is far too small to study low-frequency diseases. To do Biobank properly would cost a totally unfeasible \u00a3100bn.\"</p> <p>\"You're far better off making a more focused study of individual diseases by concentrating on the people who suffer from them, and their families. If genes influence the risk of disease, you have to study family groups and Biobank makes no allowance for this. What's more, sufferers will be committed to a long-term longitudinal study and their health records are much more likely to be complete.\"</p> <p>Jeffreys' comments won't win him any favours from Professor John Newton, chief executive officer of Biobank, but his position is secure enough not to worry. Over the years, he's been awarded just about every scientific honour, including a knighthood, and the only one that's missing is a Nobel Laureate, something many colleagues regard as long overdue.</p> <p>Not that Jeffreys is desperate for the \u00a3700,000 or so that comes with the prize. Other universities have offered him inducements to leave Leicester over the years, but he's resisted all of them. \"Partly it's out of loyalty,\" he admits, \"but it's also because every offer has been to head up this, that and the other. But what I really want to do is carry on working in the lab.\" Jeffreys' loyalty to Leicester was recently rewarded when he came top in a popularity poll - ahead of Gary Lineker and the Attenboroughs - in the local paper. \"Hmm,\" he grunts. \"I'm not sure about the statistical reliability. Most people were away and I'm sure the university skewed the voting.\"</p> <p>But what about Gary Lineker's ears? I ask. \"Genetic or environmental?\"</p> <p>\"Environmental,\" he says,without a pause. \"Now, if you don't mind, I've got the BBC coming and I need a coffee and a cigarette.\" No greater love has any man than this, that he lays down his body for genetics.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Name</strong>: Sir Alec John Jeffreys</p> <p><strong>Age</strong>: 54 </p> <p><strong>Job</strong>: Wolfson research professor of the Royal Society at Leicester University </p> <p><strong>Before that</strong>: EMBO research fellow, University of Amsterdam, 1975-77; lecturer, Leicester University, 1977; Lister Institute research fellow, 1982-91 </p> <p><strong>Honours</strong>: Davy medal, Royal Society, 1985; Linnean medal, 1994; Baly Medal, RCP, 1997; SCI medal, 1997 </p> <p><strong>Likes</strong>: rip-roaring movies, good science </p> <p><strong>Dislikes</strong>: macaroni cheese </p> <p><strong>Married</strong>: with two daughters</p>",
  "<p>I started a new school on Wednesday. I was kind of nervous about it. When I went to the open day everyone was a bit shy so it might be hard to make new friends. I only know one other person going to my new school, but I hope it will be OK.</p> <p>My new school is much bigger than my old school. It's weird because there are so many classrooms. The uniform is brown. I'm used to wearing a uniform. I wouldn't know what to wear in the morning if I didn't have one.</p> <p>My favourite lesson at my old school was literacy. We did work on grammar and punctuation and we corrected unpunctuated paragraphs. We wrote stories too. Sometimes we were given a theme and had to continue it. But I get lots more ideas at home so I try to write them down.</p> <p>I enjoy making up stories.I have a good imagination. Me and my friend made up a whole imaginary world. It's hard starting stories off, but I know what's going to be in the middle so I just keep going. I'm quite good at grammar, but sometimes I forget it when I am writing, but I can always go back and check. I think that I would definitely like to be a writer one day. I would like to write children's novels. I like reading a lot, too. I like adventure books and autobiographies. My favourite book is Chinese Cinderella. It's really sad.</p> <p>Before literacy, my favourite subject was art. I've still got loads of drawing books. My favourite things to draw are people and animals. They're quite hard to draw, but the animals are cartoon animals, so that makes it a bit easier.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to learning cooking. I can't cook at all. I want to learn Spanish. It sounds cool. And my uncle's fiancee is Spanish, so it would be good to be speak it. I'm looking forward to English literature too.</p> <p>I haven't had any homework this summer because of changing schools, which has been quite good. But - it sounds strange - some of the essays people have to do at secondary school just sound like really good fun.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Sasha Khan is a pupil at Beal high school, Redbridge</p>",
  "It is the end of the first ever lunch break at the gleaming new Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, east London, and more than 200 11-year-olds are standing silently in lines beside the netball courts. <p>\"Bags off your back and on the floor; leather school shoes on,\" commands a teacher as the pupils shuffle slightly in their oversize grey blazers with red ribbon trim. There is a brief pause and then each class files wordlessly along the school's covered cloisters (there are no corridors at Mossbourne - they are havens for unruliness and bullying) and into one of the school's \"terraced house-style\" learning areas to complete the first day of the new term. </p> <p>Mossbourne, it does not require a proud education minister to point out, is very new, very ambitious and very different from your average secondary, from the glass roof of its \u00a3325m timber and glass Richard Rogers Partnership-designed building to the state-of-the-art computer \"clusters\" located on the ground floor of each learning area (not forgetting the River Cafe-supervised school dinners and planned organic kitchen garden designed by Jamie Oliver). </p> <p>In a borough where multifarious social challenges combined with town hall ineffectiveness and mismanagement on an epic scale have led to a disastrous educational record, the academy is charged with proving that Britain's inner cities can offer high quality, well-resourced state education to children of all abilities, including the offspring of the middle class parents who currently desert Hackney in droves in search of better schools. </p> <p>Mossbourne, oversubscribed this year, belongs to the government's flagship programme of academies - state schools funded partly through private sponsorship and granted freedoms to innovate and experiment in an effort to raise standards, particularly in deprived areas. </p> <p>Five schools opening this term bring the total to 17 nationally, with a government goal of 200 academies by 2010 under a rapid expansion ordered by Downing Street but questioned by some critics concerned that the fledgling and expensive programme has yet to prove its success. </p> <p>Pacing a playground still faintly bearing the tracks of builders' machinery and overlooked by the school's two giant three-storey \"wings\", Mossbourne's principal, Sir Michael Wilshaw, (the knighthood rewarded services to education) acknowledges that the pressure is great, nationally as much as locally, to ensure that the academy succeeds. </p> <p>\"This is more than just another school in Hackney: it is a symbolic school, an emblem, saying these places should be where children from all backgrounds in inner city areas should come and be successful.\" </p> <p>Adding to the symbolism is the academy's location, on the crushed rubble of the old Hackney Downs school, decreed a failure and closed seven years ago, yet once one of the top grammars in the country and boasting old boys including Harold Pinter and Michael Caine. </p> <p>Whatever their social background, all concerned parents have the same fundamental requirements of a school, Sir Michael argues. They want good results, a sense that their child's individual needs will be identified and met, and - crucially - a safe environment, free from bullying and disruptive or dangerous behaviour. </p> <p>The school, forming a wide V shape with its windowless soundproof back to two noisy railway lines and its mainly glass front overlooking the triangular \"social area\" and the grassy expanse of Hackney Downs, has been designed according to the principal's requirements to minimise behavioural problems. </p> <p>From his glass fronted office, the principal can survey the entire playground, as well as the school's approach road and the downs. When changing lessons, pupils do not rush down internal corridors but must leave by the front door of one learning area and walk along the cloister to the next. </p> <p>\"I want to supervise these children at all times,\" says Sir Michael, who made his educational name revolutionising the educational performance of St Bonaventure's in nearby Newham. \"I can stand here [in the playground] and see their progress around the school clearly.\" </p> <p>The controlled approach extends to discipline and general behaviour, though with only 11-year-olds in the school so far - the academy will fill up year by year - the silent post-lunch break line-up feels almost eerily orderly. Later, as Sir Michael, a calm but commanding figure with a chief executive's air and wide pinstripe suit, enters one of the technology \"clusters\" where pupils sit in a three storey atrium beneath white cafe-style umbrellas, most of the youngsters remember to stand up, as they must, whenever a teacher enters a classroom. </p> <p>Today, on day two of their Mossbourne careers, the academy's pupils will be divided into sets for all main curriculum subjects, based on the tests each of 600 applicants sat before being banded and selected to engineer a cross section of ability. </p> <p>The ability mix, says Sir Michael, is crucial if the academy is to succeed. \"I wanted to ensure a balanced intake. We don't want a secondary modern school, we want a comprehensive school.\" </p> <p>A sophisticated continuous assessment system, with catch-up classes for weak areas and extension classes to build on strengths, will ensure that each pupil - including black boys, so often let down by the education system - is stretched, he argues. \"My aim is to get children here to university and Oxbridge, as well as developing those who won't take academic routes.\" </p> <p>Mossbourne's fate will depend on the confidence it inspires in parents, and particularly the middle classes, as a genuinely different type of school which is more than a very stylish building. If it could ensure its success by sheer force of will, and some confident self-promotion, then its chances, even in a traditionally under-achieving area, are strong. </p> <p>A sponsor, Clive Bourne, an engaging Hackney-born businessman who put \u00a32m and apparently endless effort into ensuring that the academy opened its doors this term, argues it will become a blueprint for all future schools in Britain. Nibbling a River Cafe-influenced salad and grinning broadly yesterday, he pronounced: \"All schools should be like this.\"</p>",
  "Parents should be given the right to decide how to spend a proportion of a school's budget, according to a report out today from the thinktank Demos. <p>It recommends the introduction of \"voice vouchers\" which would shift at least 1% of a school's annual budget into the hands of parents, enabling them to decide collectively how and where money is spent. </p> <p>This would encourage parents to work together and take a more active role in the education of their children, the report claims. </p> <p>With a typical secondary school budget in the region of \u00a33m, that would give parents \u00a330,000, with the balance under the control of the governing body. </p> <p>The report was commissioned from Demos by the Hay Group as part of a research project into \"extended\" schools, which are designed to act as hubs within their communities and offer a wider range of services to local people of all ages.</p>",
  "<p>Let's start with a little basic maths. What time do you normally get into school? About 8? And what time do you normally leave? About 6? So you can begin to see where the education secretary's coming from. If you're spending 10 hours a day at the school, it seems a waste of resources not to get the kids to put in the same sort of effort.</p> <p>OK, I know the reason you put in the overtime is to keep up with your lesson preparation and the stack of paperwork, not to mention getting a few hours blessed relief from your own kids back home, and you're going to struggle to fit all that in if you've got 300 schoolchildren to police, but you've got to remember that the bottom line is you're a public servant. So be prepared to get serving.</p> <p>The country has problems. Tax revenues are down, public spending is up and a general election is on the horizon. Something's got to give, and that something is you. What's the main gripe of working parents? The cost of after-school childcare.</p> <p>Turning schools into an extended cr\u00e8che facility is an idea of pure genius. It kills three birds with one stone. It means no more tax breaks for childcare; it addresses concerns of falling educational standards by providing the illusion kids will be up to their necks in trigonometry for an extra three hours a day; and it will have the middle classes deserting the independent sector in hordes at the prospect of not having to shell out for an east European au pair. The only downside is that the people carriers will clog the roads in rush hour, rather than at 3.30, but that's probably a price worth paying.</p> <p>No one's trying to pretend this is going to be easy for you. Your lunchtimes have already been KO-ed to do random security checks on the kiddies' crisps and colas to make sure they don't turn out as chubby as the education secretary. Now you're going to lose the rest of your free time. Trying to get the kids to do anything meaningful after lunch has always been an uphill struggle, so you're basically facing a five-hour white knuckle ride in crowd control until the parental straitjackets turn up at 6pm.</p> <p>You will obviously be rewarded for your extra input. Though not necessarily that generously. You may be offered an extra \u00a32,000 and you may also get a little help at the tail end of the day from Securicor, but the government will reckon it's got a good deal. And there's not much you can do about it because this is an initiative that is bound to play well with the punters.</p> <p>And be warned. This is only the start. It won't be long before the school terms are extended. After all, there's no point in getting rid of the need for a nanny in term-time if people still have to fork out for childcare in the holidays. So the logical step is to make the school year resemble the working year, with five or six weeks' holiday. Just be thankful no one's talking about you working nights.

  "<p>It's been 16 months since Steven Schwartz, the vice-chancellor of Brunel, was asked to lead an inquiry into university admissions in England; enough time for him to deliver three reports and come into the orbit of three different higher education ministers. Long enough, too, for him to develop his views and sharpen his positions; for while his final recommendations, published today, hardly represent a quantum leap from the carefully calibrated language of his initial consultation paper, it's not just the ministers who have moved on.</p> <p>We meet at the Institute of Engineers in central London, where Schwartz has been speaking at a Social Market Foundation seminar on admissions tests - in the Brunel Room, naturally. His new report argues, as the interim reports did, that admissions are a matter for the universities. They \"should be able to set their own critieria, choose their own assessment method and select their own students\". But - and it's a big but - \"it is important that everyone has confidence in the integrity of the admissions process\". There needs to be an acknowledgement that exam results alone are not always the best predictor of undergraduate success.</p> <p>Even in institutions that jealously guard their independence, some things have got to change. \"In the course of this inquiry we haven't found any university, and I doubt that one exists, that deliberately sets out to discriminate against students,\" Schwartz says. \"But what we have found is sometimes the system is not optimising the opportunities for some groups of students.\" Were Schwartz's proposals to be put into practice, they would represent an unprecedented overhaul of university admissions.</p> <p>Between us, we identify three - arguably four - key areas where Schwartz and his committee, the Admissions to Higher Education Steering Group, have hardened their line from their earlier papers. There is one significant dilution, too, which could well become a serious barrier to Schwartz's hopes that the recommendations he makes here will become a blueprint for admissions across higher education. But we'll come to that later.</p> <p>Schwartz has become a fanatic for post-qualification applications (PQA), where students receive offers from universities on the basis of actual, not predicted, grades. Today, Charles Clarke, the education secretary, will promise to take this forward. As Schwartz sees it, that could still mean students applying to university before they have completed their A-levels; but they would wait until they get their results before knowing which places wanted them. They would also have the chance to apply elsewhere - a particular boon for bright but nervous students who find out they've done better than expected.</p> <p>Schwartz hasn't worked out all the details, but believes it would require A-levels to be taken earlier in the year; one of the things Clarke's review will have to sort out. But it wouldn't necessarily mean, he says, an August of chaos: it hasn't in PQA systems elsewhere, such as Australia. The universities \"would get some preliminary ideas\" of who they wanted before the results were published \"and when the marks came out, there'd be this huge, unholy running around - and then it would be over\".</p> <p>Elsewhere in his 90-page report he calls for the information on admissions to be transparent and based on reliable data. \"The predicted grade system is 50% wrong. Right away you've got an invalid, unreliable set of data ... and it's not transparent because you don't know what your marks are when you apply.\"</p> <p>PQA would be easier, too, he says, with a much more centralised, professionalised admissions process. And this, perhaps more than any other section of the report, has the capacity to wind up the universities. Schwartz even suggests that students could have a single interview and have the report on that interview shared across a group of universities. So you could get an interviewer sharing results with, say Nottingham and University College London; assuming - which isn't easy to do - that they are looking for more or less the same thing.</p> <p>\"If you want to do medicine, maybe there could be a central place where all the medical schools club together, and do the interviews on everybody. If you don't have to do seven interviews, but just one, that actually reduces the time and the burden tremendously and it makes PQA all that much more do-able.\"</p> <p>Though he does not single it out specifically in the report, Schwartz has Oxbridge in mind. He wants to centralise admissions within as well as across universities. The government has long wanted the ivy-clads to take admissions out of the hands of individual colleges and Schwartz goes down that route, too.</p> <p>\"The big problem for Oxford and Cambridge is they are under the microscope all of the time and I didn't think they needed me to say it,\" he admits. \"I think they need to be goaded along to professionalise their admissions processes, so you don't get people sitting for five hours in an ante-room and being given a five-minute interview, and all that sort of stuff.\"</p> <p>If centralised admissions are good enough for the best in the US, they should be good enough for the UK. \"That's how Harvard does it, that's how Yale does it. They don't let academics in each department do it, they professionalise it. They give a better service, can engineer it in a more customer- focused way.\"</p> <p>The argument from Oxbridge has always been that it's important for the colleges to decide whom they are going to teach. \"Well, is it that important? I don't know. Harvard has got a sort of house system, and the people who work in them have never made the argument that they have to choose their students.\"</p> <p>Centralisation, says Schwartz, \"is really a proxy for professionalism\". The job of admissions tutor shouldn't be \"something you do because you are a good college citizen, but you are not really interested in it, you are certainly not going to study it, and you are not going to go for any training in it and not waste any extra time with it\". Cue harrumphing at high table.</p> <p>Elsewhere Schwartz has the new universities in his sights - at least the ones who don't want to tell the universities their record on key indicators such as drop-out and employment rates, and the A-level grades of the students they actually take on (as opposed to the grades they initially say they require, which Schwartz says are often much higher).</p> <p>Schwartz wants this information to be made available in admissions material, or at the very least via a weblink on the university's website. \"They [the new universities] will try to avoid it, because it doesn't look good for them. But if you are being asked to pay \u00a33,000 you deserve to know what it is you are buying.\"</p> <p>Schwartz floated the publication of this information in his second report. \"Some of the post-92 universities in the feedback objected ... we had a feeling these objections would be translated into not cooperating, unless it was a much stronger report.\"</p> <p>Schwartz is very hot on the need for more information for students. He wants universities to tell them clearly what they are looking for, and to explain why they reject them. And that extends to the application form from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), too. His report proposes a much more directed, broken-down form. \"We are going to prompt them now, say: this is what we want to get from you. If you know that you've got to write some things in your personal statement and other people don't know, that's not fair, so therefore we need prompts.\" Anthony McClaran, the chief executive of Ucas, is on his committee, so there is a good chance of these recommendations being made real.</p> <p>I suggest his report has come out slightly more warmly than before for the idea of introducing American-style Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SATs), to help universities to find bright candidates from less privileged backgrounds who are able but do not have great A-level results. In the past, Schwartz has never sounded that wild about SATs, but a lot of the press paint him as favouring them. Sir Peter Lampl, the chairman of the Sutton Trust and a huge enthusiast, is on his committee, and in some circles there's a belief that their time has come. Schwartz's report notes that the SAT is \"one test worth exploring, alongside other possibilities\".</p> <p>However, he adds: \"I'm not wedded to it; it's a very American system.\" He worries about the coaching people receive, and then later, rather lets his true feelings on SATs be known, describing how until this year the exam included a section on verbal analogies. \"For 70 years they've had these things which go: 'Up is to down as east is to ...' and you fill in the blank. They are harder than that, but that's the idea.</p> <p>\"So what kind of bullshit's that? They are going to spend hours and hours in classrooms teaching those things, and it's a completely artificial skill that will be of no use to them in any other circumstance other than that test and you'll get these perverse outcomes of teaching to the test, no matter how stupid this is, because they all want their kids to do well.\" Phew.</p> <p>\"The committee is relatively divided on the issue of tests,\" he admits, \"with Peter at one end thinking they are a really good idea and a number of the others thinking we've already got enough tests, students are tested to death.\" We wait to see whether on this, the Lampl will prove mightier than the Schwartz.</p> <p>And yet Schwartz has not only left the door open to SATs but also to the extension of special exams for top universities, such as LNAT for law applicants and the BMAT for medicine. \"There's a practical reason for that. When you go to Cambridge and sit down with 39 admissions tutors, they ask a question that I just cannot answer: 'If we can't do interviews because you think they are crap, and we have 4,000 students with all As, how the hell are we going to select them without an examination?' Otherwise what are they going to do?\"</p> <p>But then here's the problem we signalled earlier. If they want to, universities can pretty much choose to ignore the report. Schwartz had proposed that the so-called \"access agreement\" which universities agree with the new regulator, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), would include some kind of pro-forma acceptance of the Schwartz principles. In other words: agree to Schwartz, or you don't get to charge \u00a33,000 a student. This has gone from the final report.</p> <p>The references to Offa have been taken out, says Schwartz, because the Department for Education and Skills has ruled that the regulator should be concerned only with bursaries, and not admissions.</p> <p>Sounds like a missed opportunity. \"I think so, too, because very early in the game they gave it away, because they said 'OK we won't interfere with admissions. Universities can choose whoever they like'. Once they've painted themselves out of it, they couldn't really get back into it.\"</p> <p>Instead, Schwartz has asked that the education secretary commission another review of admissions in three years' time. Clarke will agree, at least to a review in due course. \"You are still holding a weight over the universities' head, because you know in three years' time somebody's going to come and ask you what should be done about this, what have they done about that,\" Schwartz says. \"That's got to be better than nothing - though I liked the Offa one better.\"</p> <p>If it lacks legal teeth, Schwartz hopes his report will have a broader impact in establishing that universities with a broad, diverse mix of students are a good - make that better - thing in themselves. He has come out against automatic positive discrimination to promote students from certain groups, for instance state school and/or minority ethnic backgrounds. But he argues that each student's application should be looked at individually and that in some cases, he argues, admissions tutors should choose less-qualified candidates from under-privileged or under-represented backgrounds. As he has travelled round the country, consulting on his report, this has been the toughest argument to win.</p> <p>\"The people who say 'I don't understand how you can argue for choosing diverse people' think you are just immoral, basically. And the people who say diversity is important can't understand why the others can't see it.</p> <p>\"The US supreme court argument that communications skills, team work, tolerance and empathy actually develop from having a diverse classroom is a compelling argument. I think students don't just learn from professors, they do learn from one another, and this is a way of increasing the value of their education.\"</p> <p>Schwartz's work on admissions is just about done. Now, as we walk out into the Whitehall traffic, he says he is thinking about getting stuck into another investigation, off his own bat: to discover why boys perform so much worse than girls in virtually every sector of education.</p> <p>Should be a doddle.</p>",
  "<p>I worked for BT as an engineer for four years. I had a good job and a good salary, but it wasn't something I felt passionate about. I took a few months out to go travelling and when I returned I decided I wanted to get stuck into something I really wanted to do.</p> <p>I have always been involved with sports, coaching kids and playing, and I decided to look into teaching PE. I was anxious about having left it too late, but my girlfriend at the time had gone back to university and was living with people who were older than her, so that reassured me.</p> <p>I went to see the access course leader at the local college. She interviewed me quickly to make sure I was doing the right thing. Then I contacted lots of universities to check whether the course was suitable, and started last September.</p> <p>It turned out that I was one of the youngest in the class, so all the fears of being too old disappeared. Five or six people were in their mid-20s, and the rest were older, with some people in their 50s.</p> <p>We studied four main subjects: chemistry, biology, psychology and sociology. Each one was broken down into separate modules, with an exam at the end of each subject. I hadn't studied for eight or nine years, but the teachers were fantastic - they broke us in gently, gradually increasing the workload. I liked the fact that the teachers treated us as adults.</p> <p>Most people in my class were planning to go into nursing and other medical professions. There was one other guy doing sports with me. We've all come out on top: 80%-90% of the class has been accepted into university this year.</p> <p>Meeting other adults returning to education was the best thing about the year. It was really good to be studying with people who wanted to be there.</p> <p>I'm off to Leeds Metropolitan University in a few days' time. I've been accepted to do a BA Honours in physical education. I'm really looking forward to it. Hopefully it will lead on to a PGCE and then I'll go into teaching PE in secondary schools.</p>",
  "John Kerry has fallen behind in the three biggest swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - which pollsters from both parties believe will be the key to the US presidential election, it emerged yesterday. <p>Polling figures suggest that George Bush's surge in support after the Republican convention has settled into a significant lead, confronting John Kerry with difficult tactical choices as he battles to regain the initiative. </p> <p>A poll by Time magazine showed the president on 52%, with the Democratic challenger on 41%. This is as wide a lead as Mr Bush enjoyed in the immediate aftermath of the New York convention. Newsweek magazine, however, found the Bush margin had diminished to six percentage points in the past week. </p> <p>To some extent, the varying results reflect differing polling methods. Time based its results on likely voters, identified by a number of questions on their voting background and intentions. The Newsweek survey looked at all registered voters. </p> <p>But the common theme is that the president's advantage has outlasted the hoopla of the Republican rally. The trend is also moving against Mr Kerry in the most closely-contested swing states. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom among pollsters in both camps has been that whoever wins two out of the three biggest swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - will win the election. Mr Kerry is currently behind in all three: Ohio by eight percentage points, Florida by four points, and Pennsylvania by one point. </p> <p>\"It's clear this is more than a 'bounce',\" said Andrew Kohut, the head of the Pew Research Centre, an independent polling organisation in Washington. </p> <p>\"Kerry has clearly underperformed. He's lost the first round, but the question becomes, how stable is the Bush lead - and we don't know that yet. There are still a lot of variables, like what happens in Iraq and the candidates' performance in the debates, so there are still opportunities for Kerry.\" </p> <p>However, over the past two weeks, there has been a shift in voters' perceptions of both candidates. More than half of the US electorate now has a favourable opinion of Mr Bush, according to the Newsweek survey. Meanwhile, Mr Kerry's favourable ratings, at 48%, have yet to recover from the battering he suffered from Republican speakers at the convention. </p> <p>The polling results have also shown that the Republican convention \"reset\" the election agenda, at least for now. Terrorism has become the top issue for voters, displacing concerns about the economy and healthcare, which took precedence until August. </p> <p>The nationwide shift in public opinion has been reflected in the roughly 20 swing states where the daily battle is being fought. </p> <p>States like Virginia, Arizona and Missouri, where Mr Kerry believed he had a serious chance a month ago, now appear to be solidly behind the president, potentially gaining Mr Bush crucial votes in the 538-seat electoral college that formally picks the president after the election. </p> <p>In the light of all the latest state polls, the bloc of states backing the president accounted for 168 electoral college votes, and the states solidly behind Mr Kerry carried 146, with 224 votes up for grabs - from states that were either tied or where the margin between the candidates was less than the margin of error. A total of 270 votes is required to win. </p> <p>The Kerry campaign is focusing its advertising expenditure on a smaller and smaller group of states, and has committed itself to regaining the initiative in Ohio, where it believes high unemployment should make it open to Mr Kerry's job creation ideas and other social spending programmes. </p> <p>However, that takes money away from the defence of traditionally Democratic states such as Wisconsin, Iowa, Washington and Oregon, where the president is making a serious challenge, and which are too close to call. </p> <p>The Kerry camp insists that the battle is far from over. Much bigger leads have been overturned in the last 50 days of a campaign, and the debates can be decisive in a tight race. The Kerry campaign has agreed to all three presidential debates suggested by a public commission, starting at the end of this month. The Bush negotiating team is arguing for just two. </p> <p>For Democrats, the persistently hopeful sign to emerge from all the polling data is that America remains a disgruntled country. In the Newsweek survey, 53% of voters said they were dissatisfied with \"the way things are going\" in the US. Only 39% said they were satisfied. </p> <p>Faced with that widespread discontent, both candidates are marketing themselves as agents of change - a normal strategy for a challenger, but a harder task for an incumbent with four years in office behind him. Nevertheless, Mr Bush is attempting the gambit, repeatedly describing his agenda as a response to \"changing times\" - and his opponent's platform as \"more of the same\".</p>",
  "Weekend violence in the western city of Herat is a reminder of how volatile the situation in Afghanistan remains, three years after the US overthrew the Taliban and less than four weeks before presidential elections there. <p>George Bush described Afghanistan last June as \"the first victory in the war on terror\". A year ago, the US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld declared that major combat operations were over and an era of stabilisation and reconstruction had begun. </p> <p>But despite some progress in education, health and infrastructure, Afghanistan remains far more unstable than western leaders care to admit. Afghanistan is a nation-building challenge to which even Iraq pales in comparison. </p> <p>Attacks attributed to a resurgent Taliban and its al-Qaida allies have claimed more than 1,000 lives in the past 12 months. Low-level conflict in the south and east has become the norm. Foreign aid workers have been repeatedly targeted, as in Herat on Sunday. Much of the country beyond Kabul is considered insecure. </p> <p>Major General Eric Olson, the operational commander of US forces, admitted at the weekend that his troops were \"not even close\" to defeating the insurgents. The 14,000-strong Afghan national army, prone to high levels of desertion, is struggling to make an impact. </p> <p>Parallel efforts to disarm Afghanistan's more numerous mujahideen militias - a precondition for elections, according to the 2001 Bonn accords - have stalled. </p> <p>US forces in Afghanistan total 18,000, compared with 130,000 in Iraq. Up to 10,000 Nato troops are attached to the separate international security force, Isaf. For some, that disparity suggests a lack of US commitment. </p> <p>The previously delayed elections, due on October 9, are beset by similar concerns. </p> <p>Afghans have shown considerable enthusiasm for the polls, registering in large numbers. About 4 million women are expected to cast a ballot - a revolution in the Afghan context. If they wish, they can even vote for a female candidate, Massouda Jalal. </p> <p>But security will be a big worry, with the Taliban already assassinating election workers and vowing to wreck the process if they can. Over-stretched western forces cannot possibly guarantee a safe and fair poll nationwide. </p> <p>Fraud and intimidation are also potential problems. Only a few hundred foreign observers will be on hand to monitor 25,000 polling stations. </p> <p>Western governments are nevertheless keenly anticipating a democratic triumph in Afghanistan next month - and are likely to declare one, almost whatever happens. </p> <p>Mr Bush and Tony Blair, facing their own elections, draw from the Afghan electoral process a powerful vindication of their policies. Similar considerations apply to polls planned for January in Iraq. </p> <p>Western leaders are also counting on a victory for Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's pro-western ethnic Pashtun leader and the man they installed after 9/11. That remains the most likely result, possibly after a second round of voting. </p> <p>But Mr Karzai must first see off 17 challengers, the foremost of whom is Yunus Qanuni, an ethnic Tajik who has become, in effect, the candidate of the Northern Alliance warlords who seized Kabul with US backing in 2001. </p> <p>Mr Karzai is a nationalist in a country where nationhood and national unity are still novel concepts. Should he win, his main task will be to extend his power beyond Kabul by curbing the mujahideen. </p> <p>This is the key to stamping out corruption and the multi-billion dollar trade in opium poppies; and to moving on successfully to parliamentary elections next spring. </p> <p>And this, in a symbolic way, is what Mr Karzai's weekend removal of Ismail Khan, the warlord governor of Herat, was all about. The violent reaction there may be a sign of things to come. </p> <p>Since 2001, the US has followed an improvised political strategy in Afghanistan, ostensibly promoting national self-determination while maintaining ad hoc alliances with the mujahideen. </p> <p>The challenge facing Mr Karzai is thus how to wrest control of his country not only from warlords and insurgents, but also, ultimately, from the American puppet-masters who have manipulated both them and him. </p> <p>The penalty for failure is a descent into renewed Islamism; or what into what one analyst, Kathy Gannon, calls a failed \"narco-state\", spinning rapidly out of control.</p>",
  "<p>\"Man has always been fascinated by his own reflection,\" says Robert Sandall in <strong>Acoustic Shadows</strong> (11am, Radio 4). He's thinking about sounds rather than images. \"Nowadays we build public spaces, concert halls and special acoustic chambers to control and exploit the effects of echo. For our ancestors, the best places to experience the mystery of reflected sound were out there somewhere, in the back of beyond.\" </p> <p>And he's off, to a hollow in the mountains a few hours' drive from San Diego. \"Watch out for rattlesnakes,\" his guide warns. This is the first stop in a tour of echo chambers natural and man-made, old and new, from the Mexico of the Mayas to the National Physical Lab in Teddington, via an anechoic chamber at Salford University \"where sounds go to die\". Cue lots of hand-clapping and short, sharp shrieks. </p> <p>Which, no doubt, will be the reaction in some quarters to <strong>Puttin' On the Style</strong> (8.30pm, Radio 2).

How did the daughter of a British banker and a Dutch baroness end up the darling of Hollywood directors and fashion designers? </p> <p>About a year ago Stephanie Dale wrote to 200 women living in Birmingham and asked them: <strong>What Is Missing From Your Life?</strong> (2.15pm, Radio 4).

  "Saya's agony was nearly over. Cheeks charred, fingers blackened and with 70% of her body burned, the 18-year-old woman lay prone on the hospital bed, racked with unimaginable pain. <p>Whimpering her mother's name, she jerked her bandaged arms in small, staccato movements, desperately seeking relief. There was none. Her eyes fluttered open, then closed. \"Another day, maybe two,\" predicted the doctor. </p> <p>A stony-faced relative stood over Saya, whisking away flies with a black shawl. It was all a terrible mistake, she said, an unfortunate cooking accident. No it wasn't, said nurse Afifa Hariar, standing behind. </p> <p>\"It's another suicide case,\" she tutted quietly, arms folded. \"They always try to keep it a secret.\" </p> <p>Self-immolation is the terrible choice of hundreds of Afghan women every year. Trapped in unhappy marriages or hemmed in by a conservative Islamic society, they take an appalling escape route: dousing themselves in household fuel, closing their eyes, and striking a match. Most are between 16 and 20 years old, say doctors. </p> <p>The gruesome consequences are to be found in the burns unit at Herat hospital, a severely under-equipped facility in one of Afghanistan's most prosperous provinces. </p> <p>Last Saturday 15 bandage-swaddled women lay on beds crammed into the tiny ward, groaning softly. </p> <p>Many were genuine accidents but at least four had attempted suicide, staff estimated - about the average for a city that registered 80 self-immolations in the first seven months of this year. </p> <p>Shame and stigma mean few women admit what has happened, but the staff have a keen eye for the telltale signs. </p> <p>\"When we see the depth of the burns, or smell the fuel on their clothes, we know it is no accident,\" said the unit's head, Homayon Azizi. </p> <p>The reasons behind the suicides are complex but closely intertwined with women's subordinate position in Afghan society. Forced marriage is the predominant factor, say medics and human rights workers. </p> <p>Parents marry their daughter off to older men, sometimes in exchange for a dowry as high as \u00a34,000. The unions are intolerable to some women, because of either a violent husband or an interfering mother-in-law. </p> <p>Zarah, 19, set herself on fire at the climax of an argument with her husband, just three months into their marriage. After she moved to his rural home, he started to beat her for \"disobedience\". </p> <p>\"I believed I would die. I wanted to prove to my husband that I didn't want to live with him,\" said Zarah, who has now returned to her parents' home. </p> <p>She has divorced her 22-year-old husband, but will pay a high price for the rest of her life. The blaze melted the skin on the upper half of her body, in effect welding her chin to her chest and webbing her arms to her torso. Disfigured and disabled, she cannot work and may never remarry. </p> <p>\"Every day we take her to hospital for treatment, and every night she is suffering and crying,\" said her mother, Sharifa. </p> <p>Although self-immolation occurs across Afghanistan, its incidence is highest in Herat, a western province where a degree of sophistication clashes with social conservatism. </p> <p>The now ousted warlord-cum-governor, Ismail Khan, built libraries and actively encouraged female education. But he also imposed a strict social code which starves women of opportunities to leave the home and work. </p> <p>Herat's proximity to Iran, 75 miles to the west, was also a factor, said Palwasha Kakar of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Many Afghans have lived as refugees in Iran, and are aware of the relative freedoms enjoyed by women there. </p> <p>\"Women in Herat are a little bit more sensitive. They see suicide as the only way to solve their problem,\" said Ms Kakar. </p> <p>The idea of death by burning may come from Iranian television, which can be received in Herat and sometimes broadcasts images of female suicides. Or it may be simply that household fuel is the only available weapon of self-destruction. </p> <p>Dr Azizi is not only battling a disturbing trend. His staff treat about 700 patients a year - three times as many as a similar burns unit in Europe - but work on a pitiful budget. Staff are regularly overwhelmed, patients' relatives have to buy their own medicine, and there is no proper plastic surgery equipment. </p> <p>International donors have promised Afghanistan aid this year. But in Herat, there is not even enough to pay for surgical gloves. </p> <p>There is one hope. HumaniTerra, a French aid agency, flew Dr Azizi to Marseille earlier this year for specialist burns training. It intends to do the same for other Afghan doctors this December. </p> <p>\"This phenomenon is not just about the drama of suicides. Don't forget there is a new generation of young Afghans who are working hard to improve their country,\" said the programme director, Philippe Leroy. </p> <p>Moreover, HumaniTerra has plans to invest $500,000 (\u00a3330,000) in a new burns unit in Herat. But first, says the agency, the Afghan health ministry must honour its commitment to put up the building, which will cost about the same amount. </p> <p>As with much in Afghanistan, that depends on the outcome of the October 9 presidential election. \"We're very confident it will happen,\" said Dr Leroy. \"But you can only believe it when you see it.\" </p>",
  "President Vladimir Putin made constitutional changes yesterday designed to increase his personal control of the regions and parliament, saying the government needed \"strengthening\" because it had failed at Beslan in its fight against terrorism. <p>He told regional governors, cabinet colleagues and senior bureaucrats: \"We have not achieved visible results in rooting out terrorism and in destroying its sources. </p> <p>\"The organisers and perpetrators of the terror attack are aiming at the disintegration of the state, the break-up of Russia.\" </p> <p>But some analysts said his changes, which amounted to the biggest single shakeup of his four years in power, would not help fight terrorism, but would further strengthen his already tight grip on power. </p> <p>Mr Putin said he wanted to appoint the currently elected regional governors himself, subject to vetting by the weak regional assemblies, and he wanted all MPs elected by proportional representation. </p> <p>At present half the Duma, the lower house of the federal parliament, is directly elected by constituencies, the rest according to the party vote. The new system could in theory give smaller parties seats in in parliament, but the current rules let only parties with more than 7% of the vote take seats, disqualifying most. </p> <p>Mr Putin made two other announcements of more apparent relevance to the Beslan disaster. </p> <p>He made his head of administration, Dmitri Kozak, his personal envoy to the North Caucuses region, which includes North Ossetia and Chechnya, and appointed Vladimir Yakovlev minister for reconstructed nationalities, a post designed to ease ethnic tension in the south which he abolished when be became president. </p> <p>Mr Putin hinted at plans for a Russian version of the US homeland security department, established after September 11, saying: \"We need a single organisation capable of not only dealing with terror attacks but also working to avert them, destroy criminals in their hideouts, and if necessary, abroad.\" </p> <p>In a rare mention of the social causes of terrorism, he hinted at the huge amount of unemployment and poor health of the North Caucuses. </p> <p>He said terrorism's roots lay in \"unemployment, in insufficiently effective socio-economic policy, and in insufficient education ... The district's unemployment rate is several times higher than Russia's average ... All of this provides fertile soil for extremism to grow.\" </p> <p>Lilia Shevtsova, a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment, said the changes were the \"logical extension\" of Mr Putin's desire to have vertical control the regions. </p> <p>\"The constitution still says that the Russian people are the source of power, but [now] there is nothing left in the constitution to that effect.\" </p> <p>The changes would not make him a dictator, however, since he still valued his invitations to the Group of Eight industrialised countries, and the Russian authorities were too corrupt to be authoritarian. </p> <p>Vladimir Pribyovsky, head of the thinktank Panorama, said: \"Terrorism is being used as a pretext to change the federal structure of the country.\" </p> <p>He said that the planned change to the constitution might lead to Mr Putin trying to alter the constitution to allow himself a third term at the elections in 2008. </p> <p>Before he was re-elected in March Mr Putin ruled out any changes to the constitution.</p>",

  "<p>Monsoon-like conditions of torrential rain and a whiplash wind greeted union delegates arriving in Brighton this morning for the <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/theme/index.cfm?theme=congress2004\">TUC conference</a> - but inside the conference centre the mood was noticeably more clement.</p> <p>Perhaps the grey skies and grey sea dampened activists' fire - outside the conference centre the contingent of leafleters for leftist causes and fringe events was minimal; inside, as members gathered to begin the week's agenda with a debate on employment rights, equality and energy (the agenda is, vaguely, alphabetical), the atmosphere was subdued.</p> <p>\"It's the pre-election purdah,\" said Andrew Murray, the <a href=\"http://www.tgwu.org.uk/homepage.asp?NodeID=88397\">Transport and General Worker's</a> official spokesman. \"It will be a miracle if anyone says anything interesting!\" Certainly there was little expectation that the prime minister, who addresses delegates this afternoon in what is likely to be his final \"seaside serenade\" to the brothers and sisters of the unions before the next general election, will pick a fight - but there was little hope either of more than warm words.</p> <p>With no advance copies of Mr Blair's speech available - he speaks at around 3pm, after TUC general secretary Brendan Barber - <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp\">Downing Street</a> was only saying that the PM would hail the deal negotiated between the unions and Labour at the Warwick national policy forum and point to a way forward of the government and unions \"uniting behind a forward-looking radical agenda\".</p> <p>Ironically, that deal - on which much of the current d\u00e9tente between the unions and Mr Blair rests - was hammered out by Labour chairman Ian McCartney, who came close to losing his job to Alan Milburn in last week's reshuffle.</p> <p>Here, \"Warwick\", as it known in shorthand, is seen as \"untouchable\", even if it fell short of some of the unions' demands on workplace recognition, pensions and the two-tier workforce. More of a worry is what Mr Milburn - charged with writing the next Labour manifesto - may add to it.</p> <p>\"The concern with Milburn isn't that he'll unpick Warwick, which was the best deal available at the time, but that he'll add to it by bringing in all sorts of new 'radical' stuff on top,\" says Mr Murray.</p> <p>Mr Murray, who as well working for the T&amp;G, was also a leading light in the <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp\">Stop the War coalition</a>, predicted that Mr Blair would stay well clear of the war in his speech this afternoon - despite Congress holding a minute's silence for world peace to inaugurate the annual gathering.</p> <p>Overseas speakers are expected from the US (where <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/\">AFL-CIO</a> chair Harold A Schaitberger will speak on John Kerry's prospects), Colombia, Cuba and Israel, while several Iraqi union leaders will address fringe events.</p> <p>From the government, as well as keynote addresses from the PM, chancellor Gordon Brown and education secretary Charles Clarke, Brighton's hotels, bars and B&amp;Bs are flooded with junior government figures, with Gerry Sutcliffe (minister for employment relations), Stephen Twigg, Brian Wilson, Tony McNulty, Stephen Hesford - among others - all in town today.</p> <p>This lunchtime's most interesting fringe event seems to be a two-hander with Billy Bragg and Tony Benn, on how to attract huge crowds to union-sponsered festivals and music events, while on a more serious note, T&amp;G deputy general secretary Jack Dromey picks apart the Gangmaster Act 2004 (a private members' bill, rather than government legislation) and the Royal College of Nurses' Beverley Malone debates whether targets improve public services.</p> <p>This morning's low-key session saw delegates call for a repeal of the anti-union legislation imposed under Margaret Thatcher, to meet International Labour Organisation requirements, such as the guaranteed right to reinstatement after an unfair dismissal ruling, end to size of workplace restrictions on union representation, and the introduction - long promised by Labour - of a corporate killing bill.</p>",
  "Michael Howard today promised that a future Conservative government would take the international lead on the environment and persuade America to \"join the battle against climate change\". <p>In a speech hosted by the Green Alliance, the Tory leader compared his record on the environment - as a former environment secretary - favourably with that of Tony Blair, which he said amounted to little more than a desire to lecture people.</p> <p>He also committed a future Conservative government to phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons [HFCs] between 2008 and 2014 and reforming stamp duty to encourage greater home energy efficiency. </p> <p>Mr Howard's words were welcomed by the director of Friends of the Earth, Tony Juniper, as the \"most sensible comments on the environment from a Conservative leader for many years\".</p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman, was, however, less enthusiastic, accusing the Tory leader of \"attempting to jump on the green bandwagon\".</p> <p><b>Bringing US on board</b><br></p> <p>Mr Howard used his speech to argue that Conservatives have had a long-term commitment to the environment and to highlight the perceived one-sidedness of the prime minister's relationship with the US president, George Bush.</p> <p>He claimed that, as environment secretary, he had persuaded the previous Republican administration, led by Mr Bush's father, \"not just to attend, but to sign up to the climate change convention, the forerunner to Kyoto\".</p> <p>\"It is very disappointing that Tony Blair has not succeeded in persuading the present administration that the challenge of global warming is one that cannot be shirked,\" he added.</p> <p>He further criticised the prime minister for allowing CO2 emissions to rise and for having a contradictory transport policy and one-club renewal energy strategy.</p> <p><b>New priorities</b><br></p> <p>Mr Howard said a future Conservative government would act on four key areas: reasserting Britain's international leadership on climate change; creating a global market to encourage a reduction in emissions; building up a diverse renewable energy sector; and encouraging greater energy efficiency.</p> <p>To those ends, he said a Tory government would phase out the use of HFCs, which are set to double by the end of the decade, between 2008 and 2014.</p> <p>It would examine how emission trading could be encouraged to business to \"find the most cost-effective route to reduced emissions and to make proper financial provision for the emissions it cannot yet reduce\".</p> <p>And it would look at what incentives it might introduce to encourage such \"vital sources of renewable energy\" as \"offshore wind, biomass and the emerging technologies of solar, wave and tidal power\" which, he claimed, are neglected by the government's focus on encouraging wind farms.</p> <p>Mr Howard added that the Conservatives \"are consulting on a proposal that all homes which meet a specific energy efficiency target, benefit from a reduction in stamp duty\".</p> <p>And he hinted that airlines might be called upon to pay more tax to help deal with the growing problem of aviation pollution, under the \"principle of the polluter pays\".</p> <p>While welcoming Mr Howard's speech, Mr Juniper called on the Tory leader to \"commit himself to Labour's target of reducing carbon dioxide levels by 60% by 2050\".</p> <p>Lib Dem Mr Baker, meanwhile, accused him of being a \"toxic Tory\" who had given \"an amnesty to water companies polluting rivers and attempted to repeal European environmental legislation\" as environment secretary.</p>",
  "A 10-year ban on the sale of assault weapons in the US expires today, provoking anxiety amongst police chiefs and other proponents of gun control. <p>The legislation that introduced it, brought in by Bill Clinton, attracted scorn among the pro-gun lobby in the US because it was aimed at military-style design and accessories (such as flash suppressors, which prevent the flash from a firing gun revealing your position to an enemy).</p> <p>But groups in favour of gun control deny claims that the banned guns, despite their scary appearance, are no more dangerous that hunting rifles.</p> <p>The banned assault weapons are all semi-automatics - meaning they can fire bullets in rapid succession - and allow the user to spray fire from the hip. One of the most important sections of the Clinton legislation was a limit on the number of rounds a gun could fire without reloading.

  "\"I am here to make the case for new leadership in the way we manage our environment. Success is central to our pursuit of a better quality of life. The challenge has become more pressing as the evidence grows - both of the risks we are taking and our failure to respond effectively. <p>I make the case today as leader of a party which has consistently placed concern for the environment at the heart of its philosophy. Whether the words were those of Edmund Burke or Margaret Thatcher, the sentiment has been the same for 200 years. Burke saw the living as \"the temporary possessors and life renters\" of this world. The living must think about the future, lest they, as he put it, \"leave to those who come after them a ruin instead of a habitation\".</p> <p>Over the years that rhetoric has been backed up by a long track record of action. It was Conservatives who led the way in public health and clean water - back in the nineteenth century.</p> <p>The Clean Air Acts were Conservative achievements. </p> <p>Conservative governments introduced the modern framework for countryside and wildlife protection; the ban on CFCs; tax incentives for unleaded petrol; the great clean-up of our rivers and lakes; the landfill tax; and the Home Energy and Conservation Act. </p> <p>It was Edward Heath who established the Department of the Environment. </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher was one of the first major world leaders to alert the international community to the threat of global warming. Chris Patten produced the first white paper on the environment. John Major set up the Environment Agency.</p> <p>It was a great privilege for me to serve as environment secretary. I signed the agreement to end CFCs. And one of the most extraordinary and rewarding days of my entire time in government was when I was environment secretary. Just after the 1992 election, I spent a day in Washingtonand succeeded in persuading the United States government, under George Bush senior, to sign the Climate Change Convention, the forerunner of the Kyoto Agreement.</p> <p>My successor, John Gummer, continues to be recognised as a leading international authority on the environment. This is a proud tradition, which I am determined to build on as leader of the Conservative party.</p> <p><b>Looking to the Future </b><br> Today - out of government - we are still doing our bit. Despite the hot air generated by politicians, I am proud to say that we are taking the necessary steps to make our new headquarters in Victoria Street carbon neutral!</p> <p>The environment needs a government that is prepared to set a regulatory framework that is fair, sensitive and effective, that is prepared to lead by example, and that is prepared to stand up and be counted in the international community.</p> <p>Today is a unique opportunity for me to set out the Conservative stall in front of a distinguished and informed audience. Many of you here today have done so much to persuade British governments to do the right thing as far as the environment is concerned.</p> <p>There are many issues that I could touch on. The environment encompasses almost everything we do. But I want to focus on the single most important environmental issue of all - climate change.</p> <p>Climate change is one of mankind's greatest challenges. In the last 30 years, world temperature has increased by almost half a degree centigrade. We cannot predict with certainty what will happen now. The risk of abrupt climate change exists. </p> <p>A recent report for the Pentagon states that \"with over 400 million people living in drier, subtropical, often over populated and economically poor regions today, climate change and its follow-on effects pose a severe risk to political, economic and social stability\". Climate change has happened in the past through a variety of natural causes. But I am persuaded that human activity is a major factor in the changes we see today. </p> <p>As Margaret Thatcher put it in her speech to the United Nations in 1989, \"it is mankind and his activities which are changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways\". Never one for fads or scare stories, she was the original sceptical environmentalist. And she was convinced.</p> <p>The call to action is even stronger today than it was then. </p> <p>Britain and the global community are still moving too slowly. The international effort on climate change desperately needs renewed leadership. </p> <p><b>Labour's Failure on Climate Change </b><br> Britain is in a position to provide that leadership. We have done so in the past. We are one of the few countries likely to meet our Kyoto obligations, largely it should be said because of the Conservative led \"dash for gas\" in the 1990s.</p> <p> We have a privileged relationship with the USA, which leaves us best placed to persuade them into the international fold. We assume the presidency of the G8 and the EU next year.</p> <p>My concern is that we are squandering this opportunity. Because of our failure to follow up bold rhetoric with action that inspires trust. </p> <p>The instinct of our prime minister is to lecture people. But on his watch CO2 emissions have actually risen. He has set ambitious long term targets for CO2 emission reductions but few people outside government believe that there is a coherent plan for achieving them. </p> <p>Labour's policy on sustainable transport is now a jumble of contradictions. </p> <p>Their renewable energy strategy begins and ends with onshore wind farms, despite the opposition from local communities. </p> <p>Their support for new technology is well behind that of other leading economies, despite the fact that they could transform the debate and create great opportunities for British companies.</p> <p>Their incompetence in managing European legislation has been unbelievable. Take fridges for example. When the new rules for disposing of fridges came into effect in January 2002, the UK had only two sites available for recycling and disposal. Defra incompetence led to enormous expense, the infamous \"fridge mountains\" and the transportation of redundant fridges to Europe where the appropriate machinery was available. </p> <p>How can we expect to make progress if even the most basic environmental legislation cannot be properly implemented? </p> <p>Above all, Labour have failed to engage the British people, whose decisions as consumers, taxpayers and parents are of crucial importance in shifting Britain towards being a low carbon economy. In fact, over issues like fridge mountains, they have alienated them. </p> <p>Because of Labour's high-handedness, consumers, communities and small firms now more often than not see environmental regulation as a burden and a hindrance, rather than what it should be, as a step towards a sustainable future.</p> <p>This is not the ideal background against which to assume the presidency of the G8 and the EU next year. </p> <p><b>The Conservative Approach to Climate Change </b><br> So what would a Conservative government actually do? There are four key areas for action: </p> <p>1. Re-asserting our international leadership in this area; </p> <p>2. Creating a global market to encourage a reduction in emissions; </p> <p>3. Renewing the drive for a diverse renewable energy sector; </p> <p>4. And re-focusing on increased energy efficiency. </p> <p><b>International Leadership </b><br> First of all, we must and we will reassert British leadership in the international arena. The best way is to lead by example. </p> <p><b>HFCs</b><br> First, we must be more active in removing the causes of harmful emissions where we are able to. I can announce today that the Conservatives are committed to phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, between 2008 and 2014. </p> <p>HFCs have solved one problem - they do not damage the ozone layer. But they have caused another - they contribute significantly to global warming. Their impact is some thousands of times greater than CO2. HFCs currently account for two per cent of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions and they will have doubled by the end of the first decade of the twenty first century. </p> <p>Some companies are already tackling this problem. Coca Cola - which owns around nine million refrigerators worldwide - is to phase out the use of HFCs in its refrigerators. Unilever has taken a similar stance, and Toyota is introducing non-HFC air-conditioning in their cars. These companies recognise that HFCs are not the way of the future.</p> <p>These are welcome, but isolated, examples. Unless this issue is addressed as a matter of some urgency, and government gives a clear lead, then the situation will only worsen. That is why a future Conservative government will work with our European partners to phase out the use of HFCs over the next decade.</p> <p><b>Bringing the USAinto the international fold </b><br> Like the war on terror, or the drive for responsible free trade, climate change is an international issue that depends on international cooperation. No one can opt out of the fight against global warming. </p> <p>That means persuading the Americans to join the battle against climate change. America generates a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, yet it has only four per cent of the world's population. </p> <p>Their involvement is essential if we are to have effective action. It can be done. After all, we've been here before. </p> <p>One of the greatest challenges I faced as secretary of state for the environment was to persuade the Americans to participate in the first Earth Summit. As I described earlier, I vividly remember my 24 hours of shuttle diplomacy in Washington before the Rio Summit, ending with me in the White House persuading the Americans not just to attend, but to sign up to the climate change convention, the forerunner of Kyoto. </p> <p>It is very disappointing that Tony Blair has not succeeded in persuading the present administration that the challenge of global warming is one that cannot be shirked.</p> <p><b>The Role of the Market: emissions trading and creative markets </b><br> We can help them by pressing the international community to harness the power of the free market to combat, rather than contribute to, climate change. That must be our second area of focused action. </p> <p>Conservatives have shown how the market can be used to deliver environmental ends. In the past we pioneered market incentives for both recycling and landfill. Emissions trading is the next step. It is something we began to look hard at when I was environment secretary. It will give business the incentive to find the most cost effective route to reduced emissions and to make proper financial provision for the emissions it cannot yet reduce.</p> <p>Europe's scheme is set to start at the beginning of next year. We have yet to see how effective it will be in practice, but we certainly support the principle. Schemes are already available in parts of North America. Together they will provide the building blocks for a global emissions trading system. The promotion of carbon trading will be a major objective for the next Conservative government. But to be effective it must be rigorously policed and must be built on a level playing field, with a consistent carbon value across all participants so that no nation's industry can claim to be at a competitive disadvantage. </p> <p><b>Renewable energy </b><br> Our third major area of focus will be renewable energy. Given that only three per cent of our energy comes from renewable sources, the upsides are enormous if we can find cost effective ways to tap into the almost infinite reserves of renewable energy.</p> <p>The government is betting the farm on onshore wind, focused as it is on its short-term 2010 renewable energy target. In doing so, I believe that they have made two mistakes that undermine the long term potential for renewable energy.</p> <p>First, by changing the planning guidance, they have put the renewables sector as a whole on a collision course with local opinion. They have shifted power away from local communities and put it in the hands of developers and politicians.</p> <p>We oppose the new guidelines. We are not against on shore wind but we believe that communities must be won over, not walked over. That is in the long term interest of renewable energy.</p> <p>The government's second great mistake is its neglect of offshore wind, biomass and the emerging technologies of solar, wave and tidal power.</p> <p>These are now emerging as potentially viable sources of renewable energy. I was delighted, for example, to hear of the first wave machine to supply electricity to the national grid, operating off the Orkney coast. </p> <p>These technologies offer significant commercial potential but Britain is missing out. Even with offshore wind and wave power, where we have enormous natural and technical advantages, we are losing ground to the Danes and the Portuguese.</p> <p>We should not allow these promising technologies to be victims of a classic poverty trap - what the environmentalists frequently call \"the valley of death\" - the gap between grant aid and the ongoing support provided through the Renewables Obligation. We support the principle of the Renewables Obligation but are consulting on ways to reform it so that it bridges the so-called valley of death and provides access to the necessary start-up funds.</p> <p>I am convinced that, with the right incentives and with the right long term vision, the 21st century will be the age of renewable and recoverable energy, just as the 19th century was the age of the steam engine and the 20th the age of the internal combustion and jet engines. Man's ingenuity is almost limitless, and clean energy will dominate the planet and secure our future well before the end of the century we live in today.</p> <p><b>Energy efficiency </b><br> If finding new sources of clean energy is one part of the equation, conserving the energy we use is the other. The fourth major focus for a Conservative government would be an urgent refocusing on the benefits of greater energy efficiency.</p> <p>Energy efficiency has always been the Cinderella of the debate on climate change. It is not as exciting as renewable energy, its effects are gradual and unseen. But there are huge gains to be made. </p> <p>Household energy accounts for more than a quarter of all our CO2 emissions. When I was secretary of state for the environment, I established the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, which succeeded in assisting more than two million homes by the time we left office. But I know how much more there is still to do. Indeed, because of Labour's refusal to push forward energy efficient measures for public housing, we are well behind the energy efficient target set by the last Conservative government. </p> <p><b>Home Energy Efficiency </b><br> The place where we can make the most progress is in the homes that we live in. We must face up to the challenge of Britain's ageing, inefficient housing stock. At least two thirds of it has yet to benefit from any energy efficiency measures at all. </p> <p>It is estimated that insulating the walls of a quarter of a million homes would result in annual carbon savings of around 500,000 tonnes. </p> <p>Only radical measures will ensure that we make real progress in this area. Fiscal incentives have been used in the past to make real progress. They worked, for example, when we introduced differential fuel duty to promote the use of unleaded petrol. They exist at the moment with varying rates of vehicle excise duty. We are looking at a similar approach to encourage homeowners to become more energy efficient. Today it is not a priority issue for most homeowners. Through the tax system we have the opportunity to change attitudes and make even clearer the financial and environmental benefits of energy efficiency. </p> <p>For example an adjustment to stamp duty could be a powerful incentive to increase home energy efficiency. We are consulting on a proposal that all houses which meet a specific energy efficiency target, benefit from a reduction in stamp duty - much in the way that energy efficient cars benefit from reduced road tax.</p> <p>The reform could work in either one of two ways. </p> <p>If the home has been upgraded already, the stamp duty could be reduced at the point of purchase. If the home has still to be upgraded, the new homeowner could make the improvements and then claim a rebate on the stamp duty they have paid.</p> <p>As I say this is the sort of radical measure that we must now consider if we are to make the necessary breakthrough on home energy efficiency.</p> <p>But there may be other areas as well. We also have to consider simplifying the current building regulations that relate specifically to energy efficiency standards, and perhaps replacing them with one simple thermal target.</p> <p>And we should be more ambitious about those standards, and more rigorous in making sure they are met in practice. We are way behind. Just remember that, on average, a British home consumes over three times as much energy as a German home. A Conservative government will consult on the most practical timetable to achieve zero emissions from new houses, without compounding the problems of affordable housing. That must be the ambition and we must strive to make progress towards it. </p> <p><b>Microgeneration</b><br> Micro generation - low carbon power generated by individuals, small businesses and communities to meet their needs - is likely to play an important part in this drive towards greater energy efficiency. I know that the Green Alliance have been active in making the case for bringing micro generation into the mainstream, and I am sympathetic. We should be doing more to facilitate localised generation not least because it is an opportunity to engage the public more closely with the benefits of energy independence and efficiency. </p> <p><b>Combined heat and power </b><br> We also want to make the most of a proven, but shamefully underused technology, which is more than twice as efficient as centrally-generated energy sources. If only we used CHP - combined heat and power - properly we could greatly expand the possibilities for household energy efficiency. For every 1000 megawatts of CHP energy operating in the UK, nearly one million tonnes of carbon are saved each year. </p> <p>When I was secretary of state for the environment, the Conservative government created Britain's first CHP target. We set the country on a firm path to achieving it, and then increased it. Labour have missed our CHP target by four years and the reality is that CHP capacity is now in reverse as ministers invent excuses for inaction or actively discourage it. For example, the new electricity trading arrangements put CHP producers at a significant disadvantage. </p> <p>CHP and micro CHP could be much more prominent, and they will be under the next Conservative government. We will give the CHP industry the confidence it needs to invest for a successful future. We will work closely with local authorities to encourage them to implement more community CHP schemes, particularly in new housing developments.</p> <p>And we will learn from examples of local success. We will look closely at schemes like that in Woking, whose town centre now largely runs on CHP. Britain needs more schemes like Woking's, an entirely achievable goal that would make an immense contribution to our climate change objectives.</p> <p><b>Transport</b><br> Our pursuit of energy efficiency must include the transport sector where it is clear that we must do better. </p> <p>Transport contributes around a quarter of our emissions and that proportion is expected to grow, not least as aviation emissions are expected to double by 2020.</p> <p>Over many decades, the car industry has made huge strides in making cars more fuel efficient through a combination of stick and carrot. The future looks even more promising. A new generation of cars, using LPG and hybrid technology, are on the market, offering up to 50% savings in emissions. But they represent less than 0.5% of the total UK vehicle fleet.</p> <p>Biofuels can cut emissions by 50% compared with fossil fuels. But they represent less than 0.2% of the UK market. Hydrogen is coming. Ford and General Motors have promised production model hydrogen cars by the end of the decade. </p> <p>These are exciting prospects for a government and society that has the vision and will to help the great polluter of the twentieth century become the most environmentally-friendly form of motorised transport in the 21st century.</p> <p>A Conservative government will work harder to bring the future forward. Through the tax system we have opportunities to send clearer long term signals and incentives to both motorists and suppliers. Through action at the European level, we have the opportunity to set higher standards for monitoring and improving fuel efficiency and emissions. The carrot for the industry is the guarantee of a real market in the future for fuel efficient vehicles. But the stick to ensure action will be more effective and ambitious Europe-wide energy standards.</p> <p>Government can provide leadership here not just through regulation, but by example. Between them, the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Home Office have 5,836 vehicles. Just 183 of them use alternative power. A miserable three per cent.</p> <p>The next Conservative government will make it a point of principle for every car purchased by a government department to be the most fuel efficient or best alternative fuel car available.</p> <p>Nor will we duck, as this government has done, the challenge of getting under control the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases - aviation. </p> <p>Britain cannot solve the problem of aviation pollution on its own. But we should do more to inform consumers of the environmental impact of their choices. We should work to reach faster conclusions on the feasibility of including aviation in an EU, and eventually global, emissions trading scheme.</p> <p>We should be more insistent in pursuing the principle of the polluter pays. And more imaginative in giving industry the incentives to pursue greater efficiency and less noise pollution. Promoting greener behaviour need not hold back economic growth or restrict choice. But the longer we delay action, the harder it will be to achieve that outcome. </p> <p>Today I am giving you a sense of direction in relation to promoting greener transport. Over the next few weeks and months we will be announcing more specific ideas. We hope they will generate an honest debate, one which will engage the British people with the key challenge of adapting to achieve a more sustainable way of life.</p> <p> If you asked anyone in the street whether they are concerned about the environment, they would say, \"yes, of course we are\". It is one of those issues that we are all signed up to. It is motherhood and apple pie.</p> <p>In a sense, that puts the environment at a huge disadvantage. We talk about the need for a debate on the environment but in fact that there is almost no meaningful debate. It means that politicians like me can trot up to the odd conference, and make a fine and concerned speech, and go away again, perhaps coming back in 12 months to chuck around a few statistics to show what progress has - or has not - been made.</p> <p>The urgency of global warming means that fine words are no longer enough. We need action. </p> <p>I am the first party leader who has served as environment secretary. It's an issue I care passionately about. I want the Conservatives to carry on leading this debate. And we will. </p> <p>The next Conservative government will replace aspiration with achievement and words with actions. We will reassert Britain's global leadership on climate change. We will renew the drive for a diversified renewable energy sector. We will champion renewable energy technology to bring forward the future. We will provide fiscal and pragmatic incentives to increase energy efficiency dramatically. </p> <p>And we will engage the British people because in this debate we are all decision-makers. </p> <p>We have inherited a diverse and beautiful world - we must hand it on, enhanced and not diminished. </p> <p>It should be the ambition of every politician in this country - and indeed every politician around the world - to say when he or she leaves office: if you want to see my monument, look around you. I have left this world a better place than when I found it.</p> <p>I believe that the next Conservative government will be able to say that. I am determined that it should.\"</p>",

That agenda is now hitting home.\"</p> <p>\"It was a speech that honoured many of the commitments that were reached at Warwick.

  "<p>The French government appears to have received information indicating that the two French journalists being held hostage in Iraq are still alive.</p> <p>But efforts to free the pair are being hampered by the escalating violence in the country, according to the French interior minister, Dominique de Villepin.</p> <p>Just how precarious the country is for foreign workers was clear today after reports that two Australians had been taken hostage in Iraq and would be killed within 24 hours unless Canberra withdraws its troops.</p> <p>While Mr Villepin gave no new information today about the fate of the French journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, he said there were signs that they were alive: \"The indications, that we have, are in this direction,\" he said.</p> <p>He went on to say that the scale of the fighting in Iraq is complicating French efforts to free Chesnot and Malbrunot, with the French Embassy in Baghdad having come under fire.</p> <p>Mr de Villepin reiterated that French officials are working to release the journalists.</p> <p>\"We continue to be mobilised day after day and hour by hour to work for the release of our two compatriots,\" the minister told Europe 1 radio. </p> <p>\"We are doing this in an extremely difficult context, because fighting is redoubling in Iraq. There was even mortar shrapnel in the French Embassy. It is a worrying cycle, but we want to believe that the release of our compatriots is possible soon,\" he added. </p> <p>And he called for patience, saying \"it is a difficult job\". </p> <p>Chesnot and Malbrunot were seized on August 20 on a trip to the southern Iraqi city of Najaf and the militants claiming to hold the men then demanded that France revoke a law banning Islamic head scarves from state schools. </p> <p>An Italian journalist, Enzo Baldoni, who was seized at the time, has been killed by his kidnappers.</p> <p>Last week the French government held an emergency meeting to discuss the journalists, believing that the 48-hour ransom deadline reportedly set for the execution of Chesnot and Malbrunot was about to expire.</p> <p>But the deadline came and went and nothing was heard. The confusion worsened when the Iraqi resistance group believed to be holding them denied it was demanding a ransom.</p> <p>In a statement posted on its website, the Islamic Army in Iraq said there was \"absolutely no truth\" reports that the group had demanded a \u00a32.8m ransom be paid within 48 hours.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Journalists on Trinity Mirror's regional newspapers including the Liverpool Echo and Birmingham Post today demanded a 5% pay rise across all its 240 titles.</p> <p>The National Union of Journalists said some of its members were earning just \u00a342 a day. </p> <p>The pay claim comes two months after Trinity Mirror chief executive Sly Bailey took control of its regional newspapers following the surprise departure by \"mutual agreement\" of former regional division managing director Stephen Parker.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror made pre-tax profits of \u00a3102m in the first half of this year, with around \u00a375 million coming from its regional division. Ms Bailey has pledged to make an extra \u00a37m savings over the next 15 months.</p> <p>\"Trinity Mirror is making more than \u00a3500,000 a day whilst some of our members are earning the equivalent of just \u00a342 a day,\" said NUJ general secretary Jeremy Dear. </p> <p>\"They are being exploited so shareholders can continue to line their pockets. Our claim is reasonable and affordable. In fact, it's essential if Trinity Mirror are to recruit and retain quality journalists and continue to produce successful newspapers.\"</p> <p>The claim, which was submitted by Mr Dear today, also includes a call for a new trainee banding system, an extra day's holiday for every five years' service, the re-opening of the final-salary pension scheme and a guaranteed right to time off in lieu of additional hours worked.</p> <p>Mr Dear said Trinity Mirror had boosted profits - up 25% in the first six months of 2004 - by \"axing jobs, closing the final-salary pension scheme and squeezing editorial budgets - at the same time they have been paying huge bonuses to senior executives.</p> <p>\"It's time they started rewarding those who, despite the cutbacks, are working ever harder to continue to produce high-quality newspapers.\"</p> <p>Cost-cutting at the group has so far resulted in the loss of around 550 jobs - around 5% of the work force. However, Ms Bailey said earlier this year that further savings would be met through trimming manufacturing and operational expenses. Pay rises at Trinity Mirror's regional titles are traditionally negotiated on a centre-by-centre basis rather than across-the-board. </p> <p>\"The fear is that the regional papers are becoming a cash cow for the national group,\" said Tim Gopsill, editor of the NUJ's Journalist magazine. \"Over the last two years, when there has been a big crisis in national advertising, local media has done very well. They are making a fortune, and are all making more than 20% profit [against] turnover. We want a decent share for the people who are helping them make this fantastic amount of money.\"</p> <p>Former regional boss Stephen Parker left in July. Trinity Mirror's stable of regional titles, which also includes the Newcastle Chronicle and the Western Mail, form the backbone of the group, whose national titles include the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People.</p> <p>A Trinity Mirror spokesman said: \"I can confirm that a pay claim was received from the NUJ and we will be responding to it in due course.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, today declared that the government's crusade against social exclusion was working, but his claim coincided with new figures that showed homelessness had reached a new record high.</p> <p>Launching a progress report on social exclusion Mr Blair said the government's record on poverty was one \"we can be proud of\".</p> <p>He said: \"I think the good news is there is a lot that has happened in the past few years which has made a difference.\"</p> <p>In a forward in the report, by the Social Exclusion Unit, Mr Blair added: \"Our commitment and drive to break the cycle of disadvantage has never been stronger, because as this report shows, we know that our programme of investment and reform is working.\"</p> <p>The document, Breaking the Cycle, provided an upbeat assessment of the government's achievements, although it admitted there were still significant problems to be tackled. </p> <p>It listed a number of achievements including:<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> 700,000 fewer children in poverty<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1.85 million increase in the number of people in work<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> 70% reduction in rough sleeping<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> 500,000 fewer pensioners in relative poverty</p> <p>New figures also published today underlined one of those problems. The latest homelessness statistics showed that the number of people forced into emergency accommodation has reached a record at just short of 100,000.</p> <p>They revealed that in the second quarter of this year the number of households helped under homelessness legislation increased by 2,090 to 99,380. This was almost 8,000 more than the same period last year, and confirms the extent of Britain's housing crisis.</p> <p>In his forward Mr Blair conceded: \"It is clear that we must do more to reach the families most in need.\"</p> <p>Homelessness is one of five areas identified in the report as one of the \"remaining challenges\" that the government hopes to address. The other four were: low educational attainment among poor groups; economic inactivity and concentrations of worklessness; health inequalities and concentrations of crime and poor quality environments in some areas.</p> <p>It said: \"We need to give renewed attention to these areas as a matter of priority.\"</p> <p>On homelessness it said: \"Increasing the supply of affordable housing will be central to the commitment to tackle homelessness including an increase in the number of homes in the social rent sector.\"</p> <p>The report also said there would be a new emphasis on the drive to tackle health inequalities, antisocial behaviour and educational underachievement.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the homelessness charity Shelter said: \"Our own research shows that living in temporary accommodation can have a devastating impact on health and education.</p> <p>\"It makes it extremely difficult for many people to find and keep a job and can destroy any future prospects a family and its children may have. Effectively, it can lead to sustained social exclusion.\"</p>",
  "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, responded today to a spate of deadly terrorist attacks by announcing political changes that would strengthen the Kremlin's hold on power while weakening regional governments and independent politicians. <p>Mr Putin told a joint meeting of government and governors from Russia's 89 regions that he wanted a new election law to limit the number of political parties and to have full control over nominating regional leaders. He also called for the creation of a central and powerful anti-terror agency. </p> <p>\"The organisers and perpetrators of the terror attacks are aiming at the disintegration of the state, the break up of Russia,\" he said. \"We need a single organisation capable of not only dealing with terror attacks but also working to avert them, destroy criminals in their hideouts, and if necessary, abroad.\" </p> <p>Mr Putin's declaration followed a series of terror attacks blamed on Chechen rebels, climaxing in the three-day school siege in North Ossetia in which more than 330 people, half of them children, died. </p> <p>Mr Putin has been criticised for strengthening his own powers in the past, although three weeks of violence and the deaths of 430 people have led nervous, angry Russians to voice increased support for measures to combat terrorism. </p> <p>Political opponents, however, accused him of exploiting the school siege to shore up his own position. </p> <p>\"Such proposals have nothing to do with the security of people or fighting terrorism,\" liberal MP Vladimir Ryzhkov said. \"The Kremlin is simply using the momentum.\"</p> <p>Mr Putin identified the Caucasus region, of which Chechnya is part, as a \"springboard\" for terrorism, and named one of his closest confidants, cabinet chief of staff Dmitry Kozak, to represent him in the southern area of the Russian federation that includes the Caucasus. </p> <p>Announcing electoral changes that would give the already dominant pro-Kremlin faction in parliament even greater power, he also proposed a purely proportional voting system that would eliminate the individual races that now fill half the seats in the Duma. </p> <p>Mr Ryzhkov, one of the few opposition MPs in Russia lower house of parliament, said that if Mr Putin's proposals were approved, \"the next Duma will be simply virtual, it will consist of just marionette party lists and won't enjoy any authority\". </p> <p>Mr Putin, who has already significantly curtailed the powers of regional governors, said that he would introduce legislation by the end of the year that would further reform the way regional legislatures elect their governors. The move appeared to signal he was intent on eliminating any vestiges of the governors' autonomy.</p> <p>Sergei Markov, a political analyst with close ties to the Kremlin, said the president's move could help curb corruption that has flourished in some regions. \"At the same time, it means ... a lowering of [their] general political authority and a serious lowering of political pluralism,\" Mr Markov told Ekho Moskvy radio. </p> <p>Mr Putin also hinted that a government may begin a crackdown on Islamic groups, proposing that extremist organisations serving as a cover for terrorists should be outlawed. </p> <p>A new structure called the Public Chamber would strengthen public oversight of the government and the actions of law enforcement agencies, he said. The chamber would involve non-governmental organisations and other groups in the fight against terror. </p> <p>Over the weekend, Mr Putin ordered the interior minister in North Ossetia to be sacked, and fired the regional head of the Federal Security Service, the agency that is supposed to spearhead anti-terrorist efforts. Those moves followed a meeting with his security council yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Putin said today that terrorism is rooted in the low living standards in the North Caucasus, in widespread unemployment and in poor education. </p> <p>\"This is a rich fertile ground for the growth of extremist propaganda and the recruitment of new supporters of terror,\" Mr Putin said. \"The North Caucasus is a key strategic region for Russia. It is a victim of terrorism and also a springboard for it.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Monsters and UFOs</strong></p> <p><strong>Decent place to spoil a good walk? </strong>Oakland Hills was ranked 10th in Golf Digest's prestigious top 100 US golf courses, while the clubhouse is a mirror image of George Washington's Mt Vernon home.

Either way it is flipping difficult.</p> <p><strong>Why the fearsome reputation?</strong> It all stems from the 1951 US Open, which featured only two sub-par rounds and prompted champion Hogan's monstrous analogy. When the US Open returned for the fifth time, in 1985, only one player finished under par.</p> <p><strong>Five Opens?</strong> That's quite a few They have now hosted six, and two US PGA Championships.</p> <p><strong>Those Detroit folk are a sporty lot</strong> Indeed. The Detroit Pistons have just won the NBA World Championship and the city is second in the nation in fishing rod sales, and that is a sport.</p> <p><strong>Yes, but with a lot of sitting down</strong> Just as well. Detroit citizens eat more chips per capita than the residents of any other city in the world. It is also the home of Domino's pizza, having made itself as open as possible to the interests of big business.</p> <p><strong>They've sold their soul</strong> Quite literally - the Motown label is based in Detroit and countless soul classics were recorded in the city. Aretha Franklin is from Detroit, as are Madonna, the White Stripes, Diana Ross, Eminem and Stevie Wonder.</p> <p><strong>Pavements near the course must teem with world-class buskers</strong> Actually no. Detroit may be Motor City but Oakland County is known for its pine forests, lakes and 87 golf courses with over 1,500 holes. So it is more fishin' the well-stocked trout streams than dancin' in the streets.</p> <p><strong>It all sounds very attractive</strong> The area certainly attracts all sorts. Oakland County has an unusually high incidence of UFO sightings. Perhaps coincidentally, Michigan is also a popular location for illegal marijuana cultivation.</p> <p><strong>All that and monsters too? </strong>No monsters, not unless you count the muskrat, raccoon and groundhog, which have all been seen on the greens at Oakland Hills. Wildlife enthusiasts might keep an eye out for rabbit, red fox, deer, snakes and all sorts of birds, even if geese are not quite so scary.</p> <p><strong>Sounds great.

Even when a train driver tooted \"what a load of rubbish\" on his horn as Haas played the 6th on the first day of this year's Open, he just played on as though he hadn't heard it.

Makes up in crowd-pleasing bonhomie what he lacks in catwalk currency. </p> <p><strong>Favourite shot </strong> The little veteran seems as frail as Albert Steptoe in the power stakes but he's the emperor of accuracy with a driver. </p> <p><strong>Boiling point </strong>His ever-present gameshow host's smile only slips in press conference gripes about difficult course set-ups. \"It's getting to be goofy golf,\" he said in 1999, a boon for all \"Funk in a funk\" headline writers. </p> <p><strong>What he will say</strong> \"It's fun to be in contention. Hopefully the Funky Man can keep this going and have a lot of funky fun on Sunday.\" </p> <p><strong>Who's the caddie? </strong> Mark Long works for Fred and for everyone else too.

  "The most eye-catching exhibit at the Beirut book fair a few years ago was a mock gravestone adorned with a vase of shrivelled flowers and labelled: The Arab Reader. The practice of reading, writing and publishing books in Arab countries may not actually be dead but it is far from well. <p>At the annual <a href=\"http://www.frankfurtbook-arabguest.net/index\\-e.html\">Frankfurt book fair</a>, the world's most prestigious publishing event, Arab books are usually tucked away in a corner and treated as unworthy of much attention. This year, though, when the Frankfurt fair opens on October 6, the Arab world will take pride of place. Besides Arab books on display, there will be exhibitions of Arab culture, showings of award-winning Arab films, and readings by prominent Arab writers and poets. </p> <p>The idea behind this, Volker Neumann, the book fair's president, explained at a press conference last June, is to promote dialogue and mutual understanding between cultures. A fine sentiment, but there has already been some anxiety in the Arab media about the sort of impression it will make. Will the exhibition be good enough? Will it reflect authentic Arab culture, warts and all, or will it concentrate on those aspects that find favour in the west? </p> <p>Arab books became a political issue earlier this year when the Bush administration launched its \"greater Middle East initiative\" and blamed low output of books for a \"knowledge deficit\" in the Arab countries. (\"Knowledge\", in this context, is defined in western terms and automatically excludes such things as memorising the Qur'an or knowing how to milk a goat.) </p> <p>\"The Greater Middle East region, once the cradle of scientific discovery and learning, has largely failed to keep up with today's knowledge-oriented world,\" the US said in a working paper for the G8 summit. \"Arab countries' output of books represents just 1.1% of the world total.\" </p> <p>The working paper did not see fit to mention that this figure, which has been much quoted subsequently, is 13 years out of date and almost certainly wrong. It was plucked from an old Unesco report relating to book production in 1991 - probably an untypical year for publishing in the Arab world (and certainly for Iraq and Kuwait) because of the Gulf war. </p> <p>As the UN noted last year in its Arab human development report, \"there are no accurate statistics on the actual amount of book production in the Arab world\". The report explained that tracking the publication of Arabic books is \"very difficult\" because many are published without registered numbers. </p> <p>This suggests that any official figures are likely to be an underestimate, perhaps even a gross underestimate in view of all the pirate editions that are printed in the region without respect for copyright. </p> <p>Regardless of how many books are actually published in the Arab world, a more relevant question is how many are worth reading. What do they contribute by way of useful knowledge, understanding or the spread of new ideas? All these qualities will be essential if reform in the Arab world is to have any hope of succeeding. </p> <p>One very common criticism is that modern Arabic books, taken as a whole, are particularly unchallenging in their content. Inevitably, this is a subjective view but, even after allowing for some notable exceptions and recognising that a lot of rubbish gets published elsewhere in the world, there are plenty of reasons for thinking it's a fair complaint. </p> <p>Some of the blame can certainly be pinned on Arab regimes and Islamist movements for stifling ideas that don't conform with their own. Arab interior ministers put far more effort into suppressing literary work than culture ministers put into encouraging it and Islamists harass authors that they disapprove of - as when they tried to have Nawal el-Saadawi, the Egyptian feminist writer, compulsorily divorced from her husband. </p> <p>Though the stultifying effect is undeniable, adversity does sometimes give writers the fire they need to produce great work, and censorship can even boost sales. Adama, the 1998 novel by the Saudi writer Turki al-Hamad (an eye-opening tale of sedition, sex and alcohol in the conservative kingdom), was banned by several countries including Saudi Arabia and collected four religious fatwas. It became a bestseller within a month. </p> <p>While it may be generally true, as the Arab human development report suggests, that creative activity needs \"a climate of freedom and cultural pluralism\" in order to flourish, this is not by any means the whole story. There are many far more mundane problems that hamper book publishing, too. \"For Arabs, buying a book is like buying perfume,\" said Andre Gaspard, co-founder of Saqi Books, which publishes in both Arabic and English. \"A book is a luxury in Lebanon, Syria, Morocco and Egypt.\" </p> <p>Book buying also seems to be declining among the young. A bookseller quoted by the Lebanese Daily Star newspaper last week said most of his customers were in the 30 and above age category. \"Among those, there is only an elite who would pay a large amount of money to buy a book,\" he said. \"People here would much rather prefer spending such an amount on an outing or a new outfit.\" </p> <p>Another bookseller in Beirut suggested high prices drive people to photocopy books rather than buying them. \"Lebanese university students never buy books because they can't afford them,\" he said. A non-fiction book written in English that sells for $20 or \u00a312.99 in the west can be sold in translation in the Middle East for no more than $8, Mr Gaspard said. If the price is higher, people simply won't buy it. This means it is less likely to be an economic proposition for publishers. The paper and printing costs for English and Arabic editions are virtually the same but the Arabic edition, besides having to be sold at a lower price, carries the extra burden of translation costs at around $14 per page. </p> <p>Some Arab publishers use cheaper production methods but this can result in books that drop to bits or need to have their pages slit apart with a knife. People don't trust badly-produced books, Mr Gaspard said. Some also cut corners by paying their translators as little as possible - not a good policy if the result is gibberish. Mr Gaspard recalls once attending a dinner party where a guest sat scribbling between courses, hurriedly finishing off his Arabic translation of a book on structuralism. </p> <p>The high cost of books in relation to Arab pockets is one factor, but another is the lack of libraries which, in the west, can account for as much as 70% of a book's total sales. There are some public libraries in the Gulf, but few elsewhere. Lebanon used to have one but it closed in 1975 because of the civil war and hasn't reopened. University libraries, another important potential customer, tend to shy away from controversial books, Mr Gaspard said. </p> <p>Illicit photocopying, almost on an industrial scale, hits the sales of academic books in particular. While taking a course at a Jordanian university some years ago, I found the campus bookshop mostly deserted. But a shop just across the road from the main gate had several photocopiers going full tilt. Borrow a textbook from someone else and a couple of hours later you could have your own copy, bulky and crudely-bound but a lot cheaper than the original. </p> <p>The general level of book sales is so low that an Arabic novel is considered successful if it sells 3,000 copies - in which case the lucky author earns royalties of about $1,800 (\u00a31,000). At that rate, nobody can seriously hope to make a living from writing novels in Arabic. </p> <p>This, as well as political conditions in the Middle East, may help to explain why so many Arab novelists live abroad and write in other languages such as English, French or (in a few cases) German. </p> <p>The American G8 working paper also highlighted the relatively small number of books that are translated into Arabic - allegedly about 330 a year. \"Five times as many books are translated into Greek (spoken by just 11 million people) as Arabic,\" it said. </p> <p>This is another statistic that has been much quoted since, though where it originated - and whether is it correct - is unclear. The National Book Centre of Greece, which might be expected to know about translations into Greek, does not keep count, according to a recent issue of the Index on Censorship journal. </p> <p>It is clear, though, that economic conditions in the Arab book trade discourage translation in general while favouring pirate translations where no royalties are paid or slapdash translations that readers may have difficulty understanding. </p> <p>The implication of the American working paper is that Arabs suffer from a \"knowledge deficit\" for want of translated books and that more translations would help to rectify the deficit. At the very least, that is debatable: sheer numbers are not the issue and it depends partly on whether we're talking about Harry Potter in Arabic or the seminal works of western culture. </p> <p>It is also doubtful whether a lack of Arabic-language books about science and technology is a barrier to progress. At the more advanced levels they are virtually impossible to translate and the Arabs who work in these fields are usually accustomed to reading in English or another foreign language. </p> <p>Despite the talk of a knowledge deficit, reading in foreign languages is far more widespread in the Arab world than in the west. Arab countries import about $40m (\u00a322m) worth of books and magazines every year, according to a background note for the Frankfurt book fair. Most of these are textbooks and reference books. </p> <p>By far the best selling book in Beirut at the moment is The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown. One shop alone claims to have shifted 1,000 copies. It is available in English, French and Arabic but the Arabic version seems to stay longest on the shelves. </p> <p>General-purpose bookshops in the Arab capitals - unlike their counterparts in the west - almost always have substantial foreign language sections, and in some shops the English and French books outnumber those in Arabic. </p> <p>The flow of ideas between east and west ought, of course, to be a two-way traffic so we should also consider whether the west has a knowledge deficit of its own where Arab books are concerned - a question that I hope to look at in a future article.</p>",
  "<p>As ever, before the TUC speech, I'm not short of advice. The difference this year is that I agree with it. Some have told me not to break the agreement at the Warwick policy forum in July. Some, notably Brendan [Barber, TUC general secretary], have said it's time to come out in favour of social partnership, not be embarrassed about it. All have told me not to lose touch with the concerns of the hard-working families it's our and my duty to represent.</p> <p>So I come here to praise Warwick not bury it. To advocate social partnership not belittle it. And above all to demonstrate that our and my priority is and always will be the lives, living standards and quality of life of Britain's hard-working families, the men and women who play by the rules and expect others to do the same; who worry about the bills and the mortgage and making ends meet; who struggle with the modern burden of work and family life, and don't ask for or expect miracles just a fair chance to make the most of life for them and their children.</p> <p>I frankly admit that too many people look at the past few years and see how the political and media agenda has been dominated by nothing but foreign affairs. Now there's all sorts of explanations I can give. The world agenda since September 11 2001 has been different. Different for the leaders that have stood by America since then. Different for the leaders that haven't, but dominant for both.</p> <p>I can't apologise for what I think about the world since September 11 or what I have done in the war against this vicious terrorism we face. That would be insincere and dishonest.</p> <p>But vital though that war is, the daily lives of our citizens here in Britain are not about foreign affairs. It's interest rates, the workplace, taxes and bills, schools and hospitals, crime and ASB [anti-social behaviour]. Their stage is not the world; it's here on our streets, our towns, villages and cities.</p> <p>Yet even at the height of the crises of the last three years - since I stood here in this hall on 11 September and spoke about this new form of terrorism our world faces - we have never stopped working on that domestic, bread and butter, real life agenda.</p> <p>But I acknowledge it hasn't seemed like that. I have never been away from those issues that make daily life good or bad for our people. But too many people watching the news every night might think I have. And if I can put it like this: even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back. </p> <p>The best way of doing that is to prove it by action.</p> <p>Over the weekend I got out the first speech I ever made to a Labour party conference not as leader but as Employment spokesman back in 1990. I said: a Labour government would introduce a minimum wage; a legal right to union recognition; sign the social chapter; restore trade union rights at GCHQ; improve maternity leave; introduce paid holidays; end blacklisting; and remove the power of automatic dismissal for those lawfully on strike.</p> <p>We have done every one of those things. But we only did them by being in government not in permanent opposition.</p> <p>There is another thing I want to remind you about that period. The name of my opposite number in the Tory cabinet that gave us mass unemployment, soaring interest rates, and the poll tax. You may remember him. Mr Michael Howard.</p> <p>And I've told you what I said in 1990.</p> <p>Let me tell you what he said in 1990.</p> <p>That the minimum wage would cost 1 million jobs.</p> <p>That the social chapter would cost another half million.</p> <p>He was talking nonsense then. He talks nonsense now.</p> <p>And if we want to keep our economy strong, we need to keep Mr Howard in opposition.</p> <p>None of this - not the economic strength, not the legislation to correct injustice at work, came through chance, but through choice. The choice you made was not to make demands you knew won't be met; nor to hark back to the past; but to understand economic stability had to be the irreducible bedrock of economic opportunity and social progress.</p> <p>Seven years on, our long-term interest rates are the lowest for 25 years, matching continental levels. Employment has risen steadily without generating inflation. Economic growth is currently the highest in the G8 with 29 quarters of consecutive growth since 1997. The public finances are in good shape. Immense productivity challenges remain, but the foundations of future prosperity are being laid. </p> <p>And the difference we have made to the living standards of hard-working families since we came to office is crystal clear. Average monthly mortgage payments are \u00a3400 less under this government than under the Conservatives. Property repossessions, so devastating during the late 1980s, are now at a historic low. Families are far better off with living standards growing by a fifth since 1996/97. The average working family with children is \u00a31350 a year better off in real terms since Labour came to power. The poorest fifth are over \u00a33000 a year better off in real terms. </p> <p>It's a clear reminder that economic stability is for a purpose - to create a fairer, more prosperous society with decent provision for the least advantaged, and world-class public services for all.</p> <p>Full employment has transformed regions of the country left behind in the 80s. Across Britain's cities, City centres and riversides that had become drab, empty at night, are now vibrant. Derelict factories and empty warehouses have been converted into new homes and businesses providing the jobs of the future. Britain is working, its economy now one of the most dynamic and competitive in the world. </p> <p>We are the only major nation in the world that for the last two years and the next two will be increasing public investment in healthcare and education as a percentage of national income. The only one.</p> <p>Alongside that 700,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. Almost two million pensioners relieved from acute hardship. And there has been record help for poorer families through childcare benefit, tax credits and family support.</p> <p>So when I hear people saying we should pursue Labour policies not Tory ones, I say what could be more Labour than record jobs, record investment in the NHS and millions lifted out of poverty.</p> <p>And yet you don't continue to govern on the basis of your record but on the basis of your vision of the future.</p> <p>The truth is modern life for many of our people is tough. There are jobs but they are often insecure. There are still too many people who are sick and disabled who would like to work, but don't have the opportunity to do so. The minimum wage may give some protection but it's hard to raise a family on it. Years ago, if you talked of pensions, you meant pensioners. Today, there is real anxiety amongst those of working age as to how to save for their retirement. More women work than ever before but balancing work and family life is a struggle and equal pay still an aspiration not a reality for millions of women.</p> <p>And what's more, even if people are in work, reasonably secure, comfortably off, the economy they work in is part of a world market that has never seen such revolutionary changes in technology, in consumer tastes, and in the scale of competition. China and India each with well over one billion people mean that every European nation no longer competes today only with America and Japan, let alone only each other.</p> <p>So how do we - us in government, you in trade unions and in business - help our people cope with change, survive it and prosper in it?</p> <p>When I opened recently one of the many new community centres in the former coalfields in the north-east, there was a union banner. It featured a picture of Peter Lee, who in 1869 founded the miners' union in the Durham Coalfield. The union was formed to break the virtual serfdom with which the coal owners ruled those that worked for them. The union successfully fought for miners' rights. In time, in Durham alone over 120 collieries employed 150,000 men. But the union did more than fight for them at the workplace. It founded mutual societies to provide them with help for medical care and pensions. It looked after legal claims and families bereaved. The unions stood for solidarity not only at work, but also through life.</p> <p>No one works in the mines of Durham today. The whole economy of the north-east is new. The jobs are new. The way of life is new. Within a few years of the mines closing, Fujitsu, one of the great Japanese hopes of inward investment, had set up its factory in my constituency and closed it again when the microchip market collapsed. The process of change is constant. </p> <p>So the issue for trade unions is the same as for the rest of us: how to adapt to change, to keep principles intact whilst the reality in which they exist, has been transformed. </p> <p>Once before, you took a decision to put aside the past in order to equip the Labour party to govern successfully. Today, I ask you - as social partners to do the same - to help the country succeed.</p> <p>This to me is the significance of what was agreed at Warwick. </p> <p>There can be no return to the industrial relations framework of the 1970s, no move away from the enterprise and dynamism a modern economy needs. We cannot and will not reverse the programme of change and modernisation that together with record investment is delivering public services combining equity with choice and excellence. </p> <p>Union members are not just workers. They use the NHS. They need good state schools for their children. And they know that the welfare state of 2004 not 1945 has to be one that re-distributes opportunity not merely pays more out in benefit.</p> <p>These changes as much as the money are allowing us to cut dramatically the waiting time for operations; make sure, for example that no London borough now has pass rates of under 40% for GSCEs, up from 25% in 1997; and make long-term youth unemployment literally disappear. This is not selling out; it is paying back, reducing inequality, extending opportunity, giving hope.</p> <p>Warwick should be seen not as diluting the changes we have made but conditioning them with one very basic set of principles at its heart: good jobs don't come with bad work practices; successful employers don't succeed by abusing their employees; quality public services don't achieve excellence by undervaluing public servants.</p> <p>In other words, our belief is that the more we value, invest in, understand and resolve the dilemmas of those that produce the wealth and services of our nation, in the modern world, the more likely we are to have the future we desire.</p> <p>What does this mean in practice?</p> <p>First, let us be clear. For Britain to prosper and thrive in the future, we need a vibrant modern manufacturing sector, just as much as a powerful service sector, and world-class public services. </p> <p>Manufacturing in the UK has gone through a difficult time as it has in every developed country in the world. There are real successes: pharmaceuticals and aerospace, or ICT and the biotechnology industry; truly world-class enterprises, of which any country should be proud. </p> <p>Britain's car industry - once thought to be in terminal decline - has been reinvigorated, gaining a new lease of life. </p> <p>Nissan in Sunderland is the most productive car plant in Europe, last month producing the millionth Nissan for the UK market. The new Mini built at Cowley is a runway success with half a million cars now coming off the production line, and the sector as a whole is now the UK's largest source of manufactured exports. </p> <p>But there is a huge amount to do. We will continue to see how investment in technology, the tax system for capital investment, and help for businesses to grow can benefit manufacturing.</p> <p>And in every region, each Regional Development Agency is now working up a strategy to build on the particular strengths of its manufacturing enterprises. </p> <p>This government now set to make the largest sustained investment in science for a generation, \u00a33bn a year. Such a commitment means modernised labs, better pay for researchers, new research programmes at the cutting edge of human knowledge. </p> <p>Let me also make it absolutely clear that the government is determined to protect research staff facing daily threats of intimidation and violence from animal rights extremists and will bring forward legislation to ensure this.</p> <p>Second, Warwick signifies that skills, once a social cause - are now an economic imperative. </p> <p>Britain will not succeed if over a third of its workforce lacks basic qualifications. </p> <p>We've started by creating a new framework for skills and are on course to meet our 2007 target to help 1.5 million adults get basic skills and qualifications. We're also working with the TUC on the proposals for a TUC Academy to take the skills agenda even further. </p> <p>Since 1998, we've invested \u00a335m in the Trade Union Learning fund, and put Union Learning Reps on a statutory footing. We want to treble these numbers by 2010. </p> <p>Education Maintenance Allowances have been extended to every 16-19 year from a low-income background remaining in full-time education. We are extending the offer of free tuition for those without level 2 qualifications to every worker. And we are now examining whether it is possible to extend financial support to those seeking Level 3 qualifications for 19-30 year olds which with the other changes would represent the biggest expansion in access to skills for half a century.</p> <p>In over a third of the country, we are now piloting employer training schemes.</p> <p>We have expanded Modern Apprenticeships from 70,000 to 200,000 but I can tell you today we are now aiming at 300,000 modern apprenticeships by the end of 2006. </p> <p>Next, because there is today, rightly, far greater interaction between public, private and voluntary sectors to deliver public services, we have agreed a new deal to tackle the two-tier workforce. </p> <p>In local government, we have already acted to end the 'two-tier' workforce. At Warwick, we made the commitment to end it across the public sector; and we will fulfil that commitment. </p> <p>In some workplaces, there is a long hours culture regardless of whether it is productive. We have introduced a right for people to choose not to work more than 48 hours, and an entitlement for the first time to four weeks paid holiday a year. We are committed to ensuring that people are able to exercise a genuine choice about the hours they work. </p> <p>And let me repeat the commitment we made at Warwick that in a third term, the Labour government will extend the paid holiday entitlement, so that the four-weeks is always an addition to eight days of public holiday. </p> <p>Our new family friendly law means that employers are now required to consider seriously requests from parents with children under six - or disabled children under 18 - to work flexibly. Nearly one million parents have taken advantage of the new law, and have applied for a change in working hours. Eight out of 10 requests have been accepted in full. </p> <p>It is not right that mothers or fathers are refused time off to see their sick child through a hospital operation, the right to time off when a family member is ill. </p> <p>So we want to build on what's so far been achieved. </p> <p>We've made a commitment to our social partners not to introduce any changes before 2006. But the time is right to start thinking about the next steps. In particular, we will examine how we can extend this right to flexible working to the growing numbers of citizens who have caring responsibilities for the elderly and disabled. </p> <p>From the spring of next year, employees will have new rights to information and consultation at work, not preventing necessary change at work, but ensuring employees are treated as partners in that change.</p> <p>We will we act to root out abuse at the very bottom of the labour market where working people are most vulnerable. The government will support Jim Sheridan MP's private member's bill to curb exploitative activities among agricultural gang masters. We will improve protection for migrant workers, strengthening measures against employers who seek to exploit them. It is neither fair for those who are exploited, nor for those firms who do play by the rules when a few rogue employers are able to get away with ignoring the law.</p> <p>You know our concerns on agency workers to maintain necessary labour market flexibility. But whilst we must meet those concerns, we will support the EU directive on agency workers.</p> <p>And we'll ensure greater safety for front-line workers in retailing, transport, and the public services, those who working to help others, face the constant daily threat of violence and anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>We will publish proposals on corporate manslaughter in the current parliamentary session, and introduce legislation to ensure that corporations are prosecuted for a serious criminal offence where they show such wilful disregard for their employees that it results in death. </p> <p>Finally, building on Barbara Castle's Equal Pay Act, Margaret Prosser's Women and Work Commission will enable us to ensure that in our generation, we close the gap in pay and opportunity between men and women at the workplace. </p> <p>This is not an agenda about flying pickets, secondary action or the closed shop. Leave the past to the past. But it is an agenda that if carried through, will radically improve the lives of Britain's hard working and hard-pressed families. </p> <p>Work with us to get these changes. Help us to fashion them in a way that most benefits your members, actual and prospective. Make a reality of the social partnership with sensible forward-looking employers who share the belief that efficiency and fairness go hand in hand.</p> <p>Trade unions have a past of which they are rightly proud. Today they are reaching out to the future. In the public services, \"Agenda for Change\" in the NHS, the \"Schools Workforce Reform\" programme in education mean radical change in the way services will operate, but they are changes not just supported but in many cases, shaped by constructive union participation.</p> <p>Across the private sector, unions like Amicus at Rolls Royce, UNIFI at Royal Bank of Scotland, CWU at Alliance &amp; Leicester have protected or enhanced company pension schemes in imaginative ways to keep their members. The GMB, GPMU, and TGWU are now actively involved all over Britain in setting up skills and learning centres with the help of the government's Modernisation Fund. The Shop workers Union is not just increasing members but taking the lead, where the employer is in difficulty in helping the company change, restructure and prosper.</p> <p>One final area for work: pensions. There is no easy solution. The blunt truth is that the population is ageing; people live longer; and yet want, unsurprisingly, the higher living standards they experienced while working, to continue into retirement. We need to get the balance right between what the State ie the taxpayer, the individual and employer each contribute; and we need to get the system right to facilitate that contribution. But one thing I can say to you: the basic state pension and guarantees against pensioner poverty will always be an essential part of our solution to this issue; and you in the trade unions should be, along with business and industry, part of the partnership to get it right.</p> <p>Those who said unions could never adapt to the challenge of the new economy and its changes are being proved wrong. Of course, wherever there is the possibility of industrial disputes, those capture the headlines. But the true face of modern trade unionism is not to be found in the exception of industrial breakdown, but in the broad rule of social partnership and progress.</p> <p>We won't go back to the agenda of the past. But there is much for us now to do on the new agenda and do it together. To people at work, wondering whether membership of a trade union has anything to offer them, I would say: go and see. See what a modern trade union can do; see the breadth of services they provide; see the help in troubled times they can give; and if you want to, join.</p> <p>And in doing so, join us in building on the record of the past few years to seek new ambitions, new heights to scale, new ways to work, live and prosper.</p> <p>I go back to that 1990 speech. I said then: \"These are the forward-looking priorities we shall establish by our historic decisions today. The British people can now be clear. It is the Tories, not us, who believe that industrial relations is merely industrial warfare, arcane endless legal disputes about strikes and pickets as if the field of employment were merely a field of battle. It is they who are unable to escape the politics of conflict and grasp the potential for partnership. It is they who embrace the agenda of the 70s and 80s because they have no answer to the problems of the future. Let them: leave the past to those who live in it. This party belongs in the future and we can address that future with confidence and hope.\"</p> <p>It was true 14 years ago. It remains true now.</p>",
  "<p>Unions today rejected the prospect of a raised retirement age of 70, which they believe would be used by the government to force people to work longer before getting their pension.</p> <p>On the first full day of the Trade Union Congress, affiliated unions voted unanimously to campaign for new age equality regulations, coupled with wholesale resistance to the notion of an age ceiling for retirement. </p> <p>The government last year launched a consultation on the EU directive that requires member states to implement new age equality laws. </p> <p>It has now set up a specialist consultative group to look at specific issues of retirement. Unions fear that such a ceiling is a bid to ease in a new pensionable age of 70 to force the nation to work longer and help resolve the pension crisis. </p> <p>Proposing the motion on age discrimination, Jonathan Baume, from top civil servants' union the First Division Association, quoted the Marx brothers to remind conference, \"Anyone can get old - all you have to do is live long enough.\"</p> <p>\"Our members know that just because they reach 60 or 65 or 70, it doesn't mean that overnight they do not have anything to contribute in the workplace,\" said Mr Baume.</p> <p>He added: \"If you retain mandatory retirement age in legislation - it will probably end up 70 - there is a real danger that the pension age will also be raised to 70. By abolishing the retirement age you have more chances of protecting the pension age.\"</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said young workers also faced age discrimination, with many under-21s often denied the right to join a pension scheme. </p> <p>He pledged TUC support for flexibility in retirement but vowed to campaign vociferously to keep the current pensionable age intact.</p> <p>\"If we are to clamp down on discrimination then all workers, regardless of age, should enjoy worker protection - and we know that some employers do not want that,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We are determined to protect the pension age. It is enshrined in the state pension scheme and it is also a hard-earned union gain. The TUC totally rejects the position put by the CBI that the only way to resolve Britain's pension crisis is to make people work longer , until older, for less. Work until you drop is not the answer.\"</p> <p>Conference also called on the government to adopt European legislation to make disability discrimination unlawful in social security provision and the design of manufactured goods.</p> <p>Protocol 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides a free standing right to protection against discrimination in the delivery of any right guaranteed by UK law, and would also require private companies to show their compliance in order to qualify for European or other governmental contracts.</p>",
  "Pro-democracy politicians failed to significantly increase their influence in Hong Kong's legislature following Sunday's elections, final official results showed today. <p>In a blow for pro-democracy campaigners, candidates won 18 directly elected seats - only one more than in the last election, and well below expectations. Hopes of securing a mass protest vote against the Beijing-backed establishment failed to materialise, despite a record 55.6% turnout. </p> <p>Voters, wary of alienating China's communists and keen to safeguard the economic prosperity that depends on the mainland, ensured a surprisingly strong showing for pro-Beijing candidates, who took 12 of the 30 popularly chosen seats, up from just seven in 2000. </p> <p>The outcome will come as a relief to China, whose leaders were concerned that Hong Kong's government, led by the unpopular chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, could have found itself paralysed in the event of an opposition majority. Analysts had predicted that the pro-democracy camp could claim 25-28 seats. </p> <p>\"Beijing will think the election results are quite positive,\" Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the University of Science and Technology, said. </p> <p>Critics blamed the opposition's poor showing partly on problems such as polling stations that ran short of ballot boxes, prompting some people to give up without voting. They also condemned an electoral system giving special interest groups the right to pick 30 of the territory's 60 MPs.</p> <p>However, the Democratic Party was also hurt by scandals embroiling two of its candidates - one of whom is still locked up in mainland China after allegedly consorting with a prostitute. The Democrats also harmed their own cause by diverting votes from a key legislative ally who was then voted out of office.</p> <p>The political atmosphere has been highly charged for more than a year, following a huge protest march against Hong Kong's government over an anti-subversion law that many saw as a threat to their freedom. </p> <p>Widespread unhappiness with China's recent decision to rule out full democracy also fuelled public anger. Mr Tung was chosen by a pro-Beijing committee, and China has said Hong Kong cannot directly pick his successor in 2007.</p> <p>Among the seats won by opposition candidates was one claimed by the state's most famous activist, \"Longhair\" - Leung Kwok-hung - who sports a Che Guevara T-shirt and is known for staging noisy, flag-burning protests. </p> <p>Several hours after Mr Leung had been declared a winner he launched another demonstration, chanting slogans outside government offices.</p> <p>Another seat went to the outspoken former radio host Albert Cheng, who went off the air in May amid alleged threats over his pro-democracy comments. </p> <p>Mr Cheng will also prove an irritant to the government, with his radio style including ambushing officials on air by dragging them into difficult exchanges.</p>",
  "<p>The beginning of term for students at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) will not be disrupted by a threatened dispute over contracts for hourly paid lecturers, after both sides agreed to further talks.</p> <p>The lecturers' union Natfhe claimed it had succeeded in overturning attempts by the university's management to impose \"burger bar\" contracts on 640 part-time and hourly paid academic staff. The university said the proposed contracts had been \"misunderstood\" and would give staff permanent status. </p> <p>Carol Nield, personnel manager at MMU, said about 350 of the staff had accepted the contracts. Pending talks with the union in October, hours would be allocated to staff in the traditional way. </p> <p>Natfhe has opposed a clause in the new contract that would have allowed the university to reduce staff hours, even to zero, at minimal notice. It called for the immediate withdrawal of what it described as the \"burger-bar\" contracts - embodying the worst kind of employment terms often found in fast food outlets. The union declared a formal dispute with the threat of industrial action and asked the Commission for Racial Equality to consider prosecuting the university for breaches of employment legislation.</p> <p>Ms Nield said today: \"There has been a significant misunderstanding about the contracts and the way in which they will operate. We have never said that if you don't sign you would have no hours. The contract will transfer staff to permanent status.\"</p> <p>Natfhe's national official, Andy Pike, said: \"We are very pleased that the university has seen sense and agreed to withdraw the 'zero hours' contract. This demonstrates that when academics and other employees stand fast and refuse to accept bad employment practice they can protect their conditions. It is always important that any new contract is established by agreement through the proper negotiating channels.\"</p>",

Other guests, including Denzel Washington and Simon Cowell, were no match for BBC1's Last Night of the Proms, which averaged 4.6 million.</p> <p>In the battle of the chatshow hosts, Parkinson narrowly beat his BBC1 rival Jonathan Ross, whose Friday night show had 3.6 million viewers, a quarter of the audience at 10.35pm. Guests on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross included Noel Gallagher, who stung the host into a four-letter outburst by constantly referring to him as \"Shandypants\".</p> <p>ITV1 bosses had more joy earlier in the evening as the second instalment of Simon Cowell's X-Factor added nearly 1.5 million viewers on its first episode last week. The talent show, the centre of a legal battle between Cowell and his some-time collaborator Simon Fuller, was up from 4.9 million to 6.3 million viewers, more than a third of the audience. </p> <p>The second of ITV's Trapped drama trilogy also performed better than last week.

  "<p>Schools must be legally required to cooperate with other agencies to ensure children are protected, the NSPCC said today. </p> <p>Amendments must be made to the children bill if it is to keep youngsters safe, said a coalition of children's sector organisations, which includes child protection experts NSPCC. </p> <p>The call increased the pressure on the government to be tougher on schools in the new plans for child protection after the Metropolitan police and 14 other institutions last week demanded that they be obliged to take part. </p> <p>Gerry Tissier, NSPCC spokesman, said: \"Schools are the only agency not to be named [in the bill] as having a statutory duty to co-operate with other agencies.\" </p> <p>Agency cooperation was a major issue in the inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. </p> <p>Victoria, eight, had 128 separate injuries on her body when she was found dead in Tottenham, north London in February 2000. </p> <p>Malnourished, she had been kept naked and bound in a freezing bathroom, starved and beaten, and tied up in a plastic sack. </p> <p>Her great aunt, Marie-Therese Kouao, and the aunt's boyfriend, Carl Manning, were jailed for life for murder in January 2001. </p> <p>The public inquiry into her death under Lord Laming in 2001 heard how various agencies were aware of certain injuries suffered by Victoria. </p> <p>It cited organisational and management failures as among the reasons for the failure to spot the abuse. </p> <p>The children bill returns to the House of Commons for its second reading today. </p> <p>The NSPCC director, Mary Marsh, said: \"Breakdowns in communication between agencies and poor practice when working together feature in almost every child abuse inquiry. </p> <p>\"All agencies have to cooperate to protect children. The only way to ensure this happens is by passing a law to make it happen.\" </p> <p>A statement on behalf of the whole coalition said: \"Although the government claims that schools are central to the successful delivery of improved outcomes, the bill neglects to require schools change the way they work. </p> <p>\"The interagency group believes that although some schools will recognise the importance of working in a more cooperative way, the government cannot rely entirely on the excellence and integrity of headteachers.\" </p> <p>It added: \"It is vital that the children bill is amended so that schools, the agency where most children spend significant amounts of their time, have a statutory obligation to engage in this agenda and work in an integrated way around the needs of children.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you thought product marketing was all about multi-million pound TV ad campaigns, think again. True, advertising still plays a major role, but media fragmentation has made it increasingly tough for brand owners to win customers solely via conventional ad campaigns. Which is why big, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are concentrating more of their marketing muscle on targeting consumers where they know they will be noticed - in shops. </p> <p>Brand owners will spend \u00a31.17bn on \"point of purchase\" - in-store - marketing activities this year. In fact, industry figures show 91% of brand-owning companies expect their expenditure on this to rise over the next year. The reason is simple: three out of four buying decisions are made by shoppers within the last few minutes before they reach the checkout. </p> <p> Not so long ago, in-store marketing meant point-of-sale promotions - the poor cousin of glossy TV advertising campaigns. But today it has become a complex and challenging, multi-disciplinary marketing specialism in its own right, extending from how products are positioned on shelves to in-store media and promotions, data collection and analysis, says Guy Vaughan, director of Retail Marketing Services, Europe's leading in-store market research specialist. </p> <p>\"For many years, in-store marketing has been driven by retailers,\" he says. All of the leading supermarket chains have followed Tesco's lead and introduced loyalty card schemes to collect invaluable insight into their shoppers' brand preferences, shopping habits and lifestyles, for example. </p> <p>Most are now developing in-store media: earlier this year Tesco became the first supermarket to launch its own TV channel, with the advertiser-friendly claim that it would attract more viewers than I'm a Celebrity _ Get Me Out of Here. </p> <p>The TV station is being rolled out in stores around the country and features health and beauty tips, recipe ideas and information on healthy living - as well as conventional advertising - on large TV screens with programming targeted to suit specific aisles. </p> <p>Rival Asda claims to reach 13m shoppers a week with its in-store media, which ranges from magazines and radio stations to live events. \"Retail marketing has got far more credibility among branded suppliers now,\" claims Asda's media centre director, Sarah Brookfield. </p> <p>Since the late 1990s, brand owners have focused on in-store marketing to try to gain greater control over how their products are marketed in-store. Some, including Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestle, have even set up in-store marketing operations dedicated to getting the best possible deal for their brands. </p> <p>\"The traditional way of taking brands to market has changed and we have had to respond to that,\" explains Jesper Wiegandt, director of P&amp;G's dedicated in-store marketing department. \"We can no longer rely on traditional advertising.\" </p> <p>Wiegandt's department comprises 10 in-store marketing specialists charged with everything from coming up with ideas for in-store events to analysing different retailers' customers for the brand marketing teams. </p> <p> \"We can't run the department as an isolated empire: co-operation with other departments is critical,\" says Wiegandt. Which is why team skills are a major requirement for in-store marketing specialists at P&amp;G. Equally important, however, is work experience from other marketing fields. </p> <p>Members of the P&amp;G team have backgrounds in traditional sales, traditional media buying and traditional advertising. What sets them apart is that they also share an entrepreneurial flair. \"As this is still a relatively new area, you need to be able to thrive in a poorly defined environment,\" says Wiegandt. </p> <p>It's a similar story at Unilever Bestfoods, the part of Unilever responsible for manufacturing brands such as PG Tips and Hellmann's. \"In-store marketing has become increasingly important over the past three or four years, driven by factors including the development of the supermarket environment and the space available in these outlets for branded FMCG products being reduced,\" says Nick Widdowson, merchandising manager for Unilever Bestfoods UK. </p> <p>There are two main aspects of visibility management, he says. \"The first concerns shelf layout - analysis of space allocation and product performance determines the optimum space a product deserves on-shelf. Understanding how the customer shops in-store, as well as the structure of the product category, helps the merchandiser recommend the best position on shelf for a product.\" </p> <p>The second involves developing \"point of purchase\" materials to enhance the display of a product on-shelf or in other positions. </p> <p> The qualifications required by visibility managers at Unilever include some in-store experience, technical and computing skills, and creative and analytical ability. The current team includes people with backgrounds in store management, customer management, brand development and supply chain management, and degrees in marketing and design. </p> <p>Despite the newness of in-store marketing as a specialism, long-term career prospects look good. The evolution of digital technology at point of purchase combined with the premium placed on space in supermarkets mean it will be critical for any consumer brand's future success.</p>",
  "<p>It is a little known fact that British scientific brainpower lies behind the development of what is routinely described as a \"miraculous\" set of drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. With funding from the Arthritis Research Campaign, a medical research charity, work by Professors Tiny Maini and Marc Feldmann, from Imperial College's Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, won the prestigious Lasker award in the US last year. The team played a significant role in the early development of the drugs Remicade, Enbrel and Humira - compounds which have been found to dramatically improve the lives of about three-quarters of the rheumatoid arthritis sufferers who take them. </p> <p>However, as the debate over the financing of Britain's biotech industry gathers pace, the development of these revolutionary new drugs is being held up as a saddening example of why the biotech industry here is failing. </p> <p>What remains a success story for British science is quite the opposite for British industry. Just over $3bn (\u00a31.7bn) was spent on this class of drugs last year, but almost all of the revenue is flowing into the coffers of American drugs firms. </p> <p>Cambridge Antibody Technology, the UK biotech firm, receives a few million pounds each year after helping its big US rival Abbott Laboratories develop Humira, but even these payments are subject to a legal dispute. Celltech, the UK's largest biotech company, recently bought by Belgian firm UCB, still has an arthritis drug in clinical trials, but it is not expected to reach the market until 2007. </p> <p>The scientists responsible, and their charity backers, receive royalties measured in the tens of millions, but Prof Feldman nevertheless describes this as \"a very poor haul\". Celltech blames its failure to deliver more rapidly on problems outside its control. The history points to a wider malaise in the UK biotechnology industry. </p> <p>In 1984, Prof Feldmann and Prof Maini were interested in how small protein molecules called cytokines are involved in rheumatoid arthritis. The production of these molecules increases as a human body mobilises its defences against invading bacteria and viruses. In rheumatoid arthritis they are constantly at high levels around the painful joints. </p> <p>Four years later the scientists made a breakthrough. They identified a molecule that reduced the amount of one particular cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), in samples from arthritic joints. Mice carrying a similar disease to arthritis were treated with these anti-TNF compound molecules and the swelling of joints eased. </p> <p><strong>Trials</strong><br> </p> <p>By 1990 the scientists were sure they had a promising new way of treating arthritis. Fortunately, several pharmaceutical companies had already started making drugs that lowered the levels of TNF in the body - working on a false assumption that it would help patients suffering from blood poisoning. </p> <p>The scientists first turned to Celltech, the only British UK firm with an anti-TNF drug, only to spend a fruitless year trying to get the firm to do trials with the compound on arthritic patients. </p> <p>At the time, many drug firms and scientists remained sceptical of the development, mindful that TNF played an important role in the body's general defences against infection and it was therefore dangerous to meddle with it. </p> <p>One of the professors' former PhD students, Dr Jim Woody, had just been appointed chief scientific officer of Centocor, an American biotech firm developing the anti-TNF drug now known as Remicade. He agreed to fund a trial on patients severely disabled by arthritis - and the results were dramatic. </p> <p>\"They went on to play golf, things they hadn't been able to do for ages,\" said Prof Feldmann. \"There was a surgeon who hadn't been able to operate for ages. He went back to work.\" </p> <p>By 1992 Switzerland's Roche, together with Immunex and Abbott from the US, had shown serious interest. Celltech also began trials, but some of its work fell by the wayside, including its main focus at the time, CDP 571. But Immunex's Enbrel (now marketed by Wyeth) and Centocor's Remicade (now owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson) arrived on the market in 1999. Patients reported seemingly miraculous results. </p> <p>Brenda Day, a 64-year-old from Stevenage, says she started developing rheumatoid arthritis in 1996 and went downhill quickly. She heard about trials of a new drug at Charing Cross Hospital, London, and in 1998 was admitted to the programme led by Prof Maini. \"The first time I had the drug there was a dramatic improvement, it was a miracle really.\" </p> <p>Although Celltech started clinical trials around 1993, it was only in the late 90s that the company geared up its programme, developing its new drug, CDP 870, which is now in trials. Finance director Peter Allen says it wasn't clear until much later than 1992 that the drugs would be capable of halting the disease in the long term. </p> <p>Many former Celltech scientists also point the finger at their partner at the time, German drugs firm Bayer, which was interested in testing the drug for blood poisoning, but dropped it when this use failed. </p> <p>But the American firms appear to have been ready to take the risk. \"For something very innovative, Britain just wasn't ambitious enough,\" said Prof Maini.</p>",
  "<p>It was <strong>quite a weekend for referees</strong>, wasn't it? The men in black really did distinguish themselves - as the greatest pranksters of them all.

  "<p>A growing \"have a go\" culture among employees has fuelled a dramatic rise in dubious employment tribunal cases, costing firms millions of pounds a year, the CBI claims today. </p> <p>Releasing its annual Employment Trends survey of 500 companies, the employers' group says more than two-thirds of firms have seen a rise in \"weak and vexatious\" tribunal claims which it says is another example of Britain's growing compensation culture. </p> <p>It cites figures from the Employment Tribunals Service that show a 17% rise in tribunal cases in the year to April. </p> <p>John Cridland, CBI deputy director general, said the trend was \"costly and time-consuming\", adding: \"With the compensation culture spiralling out of control, companies do not have confidence in the current tribunal system and are sceptical about the difference that government reforms will make.\" </p> <p>The government is bringing in new rules next month requiring employees to discuss grievances with firms before going to court. It is also moving responsibility for the system from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Department of Constitutional Affairs. </p> <p>The CBI's survey, carried out with the Pertemps employment agency, showed almost half of company respondents believe the changes will not reduce the number of tribunal cases. </p> <p>Pertemps chairman Tim Watts said many companies settled with litigants because they did not want the expense and hassle of a tribunal hearing, even when they were sure of winning. Firms were not awarded costs even when they won cases, he said. </p> <p>He conceded that managers had a responsibility to manage employees properly so they did not feel they had to resort to a tribunal. </p> <p>The CBI fears that new rules on age discrimination, due in 2006, will exacerbate the situation. </p> <p>The TUC, beginning its annual conference in Brighton, disputed the findings. </p> <p>\"The CBI has got everything wrong about employment tribunals. There is no long-term increase in applications, simply a one-off blip in cases about dress codes that could have been reduced to a single case if the law allowed group test cases,\" said TUC general secretary Brendan Barber. </p> <p>The unions were not to blame for tribunal cases, most of which were brought by non-union employees. </p> <p>\"The best way for the CBI to reduce tribunal cases would be to encourage their members to recognise unions and agree fair procedures that can deal with difficulties without resorting to legal action.\" </p> <p>The CBI report also showed increasing concern among employers about European Union regulations on working time and agency workers. </p> <p>Britain has an opt-out on the EU's working time directive, which sets a weekly maximum of 48 hours at work, while the EU has drafted legislation that would bring temps' rights into line with those of permanent staff.</p>",

He told the paper that elections would go ahead in January, even if some areas, such as Falluja, had to be excluded because of ongoing unrest. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1303127,00.html\">Thirteen die in US attack on Baghdad crowd</a><br>* <a href=\"http://search.thetimes.co.uk/cgi-bin/ezk2srch?-aSTART#\">Times: Why I cannot give every Iraqi the vote</a></p> <p><b>11 INTO 10 WON\"T GO</b></p> <p>\"Today the political soap opera goes on tour,\" writes Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian, as conference season gets under way with the TUC's annual gathering. \"One storyline will loom larger than all the others.\" Yes, Wrap readers, prepare for even more stories about Tony and Gordon.</p> <p>The Guardian kicks off with a report about divisions between the Labour party and the unions, which means points dropped by Tony Blair. It says the \"big four\" union bosses have warned the prime minister, who addresses the TUC conference today, that \"policy concessions agreed in the summer\" had to be honoured. The areas addressed in a \"national policy forum\" in July were mostly employment rights and pensions. Significantly, the union leaders also got in a dig at Alan Milburn, the Blairite MP entrusted last week with the party's manifesto. They accused him of making \"wild statements and ideas\".</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph concurs, saying union bosses have said \"they would not tolerate interference by Mr Milburn\". It cites foundation hospitals as one of Mr Milburn's \"wild ideas\", and quotes Kate Hoey, a former Labour minister who says the foundation trusts are a \"mess\". \"On the back benches\", says Ms Hoey, \"there will be a feeling of why has [Mr Milburn] come back so soon, other than to show Gordon the prime minister is in charge.\"</p> <p>In case you worry Mr Blair is clocking up too many points, let's go back to the Guardian for a gleeful report on the prime minister's conceptual difficulties with economics. A former Downing Street adviser has published a book in which he says Mr Blair is a figure of fun at No 10 for his limited grasp of the subject. Apparently, a well-meaning official once attempted to give the prime minister some basic textbooks as holiday reading. The Guardian says this ties Mr Blair into a \"noble, if slightly amateurish tradition\" going back to Alec Douglas-Home. It says Mr Blair's holiday reading \"usually consists of worthy - but not academic - biographies\", while Mr Brown likes \"to immerse himself in the works of such heavyweight thinkers as Noam Chomsky\".</p> <p>There's none of this wide-eyed admiration for Mr Brown's intellectual abilities over at the Times. Next to a sinister cartoon of an eyeless chancellor being kept out of No 10 by a snarling Milburn-dog, William Rees-Mogg launches a blistering attack on Mr Brown's pensions policy, which he says \"has been one of the great disasters of British financial history\". And that's one of the nicer bits. He says Mr Brown has wrecked both state and private pensions, imposed stealth taxes and reduced the valuation of the stock market. \"He has impoverished generations of old people past, present and to come.\" No, I don't understand how he can impoverish the past either. In any case, Rees-Mogg concludes that demographics are against Mr Brown, as an ageing population means that at the next election nearly half of active voters will be pensioners. On the front page, the Times says national insurance contributions will have to rise by one-and-a-half pence in the pound to fund bigger state pensions, and that the prime minister is considering making contributions compulsory. The chancellor, says the paper, wants to wait until the next parliament to deal with the issue.</p> <p>So, with divisions multiplying in the Labour party, happy days for the Tories? Sorry, says the Daily Telegraph. Damian Green, an MP who resigned from the shadow cabinet last week, tells the paper Michael Howard is \"wilfully dividing the party by shifting it to the right\". Bizarrely the paper's leader comment then criticises embittered former shadow cabinet members who \"assist Downing Street in creating the impression of a 'lurch to the right\".

  "Research which finds that teenage problems have more than doubled in 25 years is the kind of headline-grabbing news that social scientists launch gingerly into the public domain. You could hear the nervousness as I interviewed one of the authors. This kind of statistical research is raw and powerful ammo for a string of ugly political agendas. No wonder the researchers decided to leave alone all question of the causes of this explosion of misery: they wanted to separate out a set of bald facts about the increase in 15-year-olds' emotional and behavioural disorders, and leave others to get stuck into the arguments. <p>Put this research into the hands of the Daily Mail and it would be ample grist for those peddling tales of Britain's moral decline: kids don't know right from wrong; they lie, they steal, they're disobedient. Or another favourite: the breakdown of the family is making our teenagers miserable, and working mums should bear the most blame as the rise in maternal employment virtually parallels the increases in emotional and behavioural problems. New Labour has opted to play the former tune - Tony Blair gave one rendition earlier this summer in his tirade against 60s values. </p> <p>New Labour has had only two policies on youth: its crusade against anti-social behaviour and its mission to raise educational standards. It expects two things of adolescents: that they achieve academically and are law-abiding. A very large proportion fail on one or both accounts. Surveys of the developed world show UK teenagers have one of the worst staying-on rates in after-16 education and are more likely than most to take drugs, binge drink and have underage sex. Compared with this dire record, the success story of government policy has been all about Sure Start and early years. The language is about investment, as if children were stock options. The pressure is on teenagers to start paying returns - and yet this is entirely at odds with reality. </p> <p>Never has the financial dependence of children lasted so long - well into their 20s - and at the same time consumer pressures have intensified. No political party has known what to do with adolescents once the apprenticeships and assembly-line jobs ran out. The Tories cut their benefits. Under New Labour, they got the New Deal and little else. Adolescents have had a raw deal out of a government which heaps expectations on them which they can't meet. In the New Labour rubric of rights and responsibilities, they were given the latter but without the means to fulfil them. At the same time, the rights shrank. It is harder than ever to get on to the housing ladder, harder than ever to fund a university education. New Labour has only exacerbated the contradictions of the transition to adulthood which awaits your average 15-year-old. We expect them to be independent and yet cut off all financial means of being so. No wonder the 18- to 24-year-olds are the constituency least likely to vote. </p> <p>Experts are divided about the rise in teenage misery. They broadly fall into two camps. The first take the view that the causes lie predominantly in structural issues: for example, the labour market has few jobs for 16-year-olds spilling out of an unsatisfactory education, and the secondary educational system sets up far too many children to fail. Plus, we have a media culture which bombards teenagers with marketing and invidious social comparisons that undermine self-esteem. As a result, adolescence has became a painful experience and teenagers are self-medicating with drugs and drink to cope with the stress. </p> <p>This is the explanation which has got through to government, and two initiatives out next month will propose remedies: the Tomlinson report is looking into a restructuring of education for 14- to 19-year-olds, while a green paper will look at youth services such as leisure activities. The concern is that both are being drawn up according to the familiar New Labour preoccupations of ensuring that teenagers are employable and law-abiding. </p> <p>The second camp take a much bigger and more disturbing view. They argue that this is not just a problem of adolescence, but that further research is likely to show up a comparable rise in miserable seven-year-olds. They argue that there has been a deterioration in the mental health of all children. This isn't just about troubled teenagers but troubled tots. An increasing number of under-twos are exhibiting abnormal behaviour which is being diagnosed as depression. </p> <p>The idea that we are raising unhappy children seems close to a doom scenario, but even more horrifying is how commonplace this kind of assumption seems to be among many experts in child and adolescent mental health. It is an assumption which has made few inroads into public debate and has had precious little impact on government policy: only 5% of the mental health budget goes to the under-16s. Perhaps we just don't want to know; we invest so much in the happiness of our children, we can't bring ourselves to face the evidence to the contrary. Perhaps we prefer to indulge in moral panics about their unruly behaviour rather than listen to their misery. </p> <p>This line of argument takes us swiftly into huge controversy because it goes to the heart of how we parent. It suggests that an increasing minority of parents are unable or unwilling to provide the emotional nurturing which will ensure a resilient child. Margot Waddell, consultant psychotherapist at the Tavistock Clinic in London, defines that as wisdom, thoughtfulness, consistency, forbearance and availability. These qualities can occur in any shape of family and in any kind of childcare, so we shouldn't get caught up in pinning the blame on single parents or working mothers - it's the emotional dynamics which count. The question is why fewer of us are providing that kind of care for our children. At adolescence, early experiences of childhood are being replayed, says Waddell, and the stress of the transition to adulthood exposes all the faultlines. Dinah Morley, of the mental health charity Young Minds, puts it even more starkly: there is a failure in attachment. A growing number of us simply aren't bonding sufficiently with our babies. </p> <p>That's a haunting thought. We're anxious parents now, but what we worry about more than ever is our children's safety, health and education. Childhood has been infected by a highly supervised techno-managerialism loaded with targets and statistics - developmental outcomes, tests, league tables - and perhaps we need to put back centre stage an old dream: happy children. What is just as important to a child's life chances as a clutch of exam certificates is their emotional resilience to deal with what life will throw at them. It's a troubling possibility that our teenagers are like the canaries they used to take down the mines to detect gas. Their acting-up is acting out a much bigger problem. </p> <p><b> \u00b7</b> Time Trends in Adolescent Mental Health is published in November's issue of the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Evidence of prisoner abuse and possible war crimes at Guant\u00e1namo Bay reached the highest levels of the Bush administration as early as autumn 2002, but Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, chose to do nothing about it, according to a new investigation published exclusively in the Guardian today. </p> <p>The investigation, by the veteran journalist Seymour Hersh, quotes one former marine at the camp recalling sessions in which guards would \"fuck with [detainees] as much as we could\" by inflicting pain on them. </p> <p>The Bush administration repeatedly assured critics that inmates were granted recreation periods, but one Pentagon adviser told Hersh how, for some prisoners, they consisted of being left in straitjackets in intense sunlight with hoods over their heads. </p> <p>Hersh provides details of how President George Bush signed off on the establishment of a secret unit that was given advance approval to kill or capture and interrogate \"high-value\" suspects - considered by many to be in defiance of international law - an officially \"unacknowledged\" programme that was eventually transferred wholesale from Guant\u00e1namo to the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. </p> <p>Hersh, who broke the story of the My Lai massacre in the Vietnam war, makes his revelations in a new book, Chain of Command, which leaves senior figures in the Bush administration far more seriously implicated in the torture scandal than had been previously apparent. </p> <p>A CIA analyst visited Guant\u00e1namo in summer 2002 and returned \"convinced that we were committing war crimes\" and that \"more than half the people there didn't belong there. He found people lying in their own faeces,\" a CIA source told Hersh. </p> <p>The analyst submitted a report to General John Gordon, an aide to Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's national security adviser. </p> <p>Gen Gordon was troubled, and, one former administration official told Hersh \"that if the actions at Guant\u00e1namo ever became public, it'd be damaging to the president\". </p> <p>Ms Rice saw the document by autumn of the same year, and called a high-level meeting at which she asked Mr Rumsfeld, to deal with the problem. </p> <p>But after he vowed to act, \"the Pentagon went into a full-court stall\", a former White House official is quoted as saying. \"Why didn't Condi do more? She made the same mistake I made. She got the secretary of defence to say he's going to take care of it.\" </p> <p>The investigation further suggests that CIA and FBI staff had already witnessed incidents at Guant\u00e1namo just as extreme as those that would subsequently be alleged by freed inmates. </p> <p>A senior intelligence official told Hersh: \"I was told [by FBI agents] that the military guards were slapping prisoners, stripping them, pouring cold water over them and making them stand until they got hypothermia.\" </p> <p>The secret \"special access programme\" facilitating much of the mistreatment of prisoners, widely held to have contravened the Geneva convention, was established following a direct order from the president. </p> <p>Hersh reports that a secret document signed by Mr Bush in February 2002 stated: \"I determine that none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al-Qaida in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world.\" </p> <p>Hersh's book reports that an army officer communicated concerns over abuses at Abu Ghraib both to General John Abizaid, the US central command (Centcom) chief at the time, and his deputy, General Lance Smith. </p> <p>The officer told Hersh: \"I said there are systematic abuses going on in the prisons. Abizaid didn't say a thing. He looked at me - beyond me, as if to say, 'Move on. I don't want to touch this.'\" Centcom has disputed the allegation. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Hersh provided evidence that the administration sought to evade the issue: he said codenames of some programmes were changed within hours of his original story appearing, presumably to maintain their secrecy. </p> <p>In a statement, the Pentagon said Hersh's investigation \"apparently contains many of the numerous unsubstantiated allegations and inaccuracies which he has made in the past based upon unnamed sources ... Thus far ... investigations have determined that no responsible official of the Department of Defence approved any programme that could conceivably have authorised or condoned the abuses seen at Abu Ghraib. If any of Mr Hersh's anonymous sources wish to come forward and offer evidence to the contrary, the department welcomes them to do so.\" </p> <p>Pressure has been building on the Pentagon over its detention policies after it emerged at a Congressional hearing last week that the administration is being accused of concealing up to 100 \"ghost detainees\" from the Red Cross, which must be granted access to prisoners of war and other detainees under the Geneva convention. </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld told reporters on Friday he had approved the use of harsh interrogation measures, but that they had only been meant for Guant\u00e1namo. He said the measures ought to be contrasted with those of terrorists. \"Does it rank up there with chopping someone's head off on television?\" he asked. \"It doesn't.\"</p>",
  "<p>At first it seemed like someone had made an embarrassing mistake. The presidential aide to the North Caucuses, Vladimir Yakovlev, said on Russian news wires that an entire school had been kidnapped. This was so hard to believe that it took a while before the rush to head south. </p> <p>Beslan airport was promptly closed, and we opted to concentrate on using a local stringer and a proper package for Thursday's paper. The Times and Independent headed straight for Beslan and got there at about 11pm, or 8pm London time. I landed about 14 hours later at the same Mineralniye Vodi airport, two hours north of Beslan. </p> <p>At the airport, a gruff policeman dragged me into a cramped office where they made it clear they were looking for a German reporter and al-Jazeera. They let us go after photocopying our documents. Two hours later, we crossed into Northern Ossetia easily. Others were less lucky - Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter known for her bold coverage of Chechnya, and a Georgian TV crew saying they were drugged, presumably by the authorities. </p> <p>But once we were in Beslan, federal control evaporated. Before the siege began, a cordon was maintained by local police and some federal troops, blocking all vantage points onto the school. The gunmen had been taking pot shots and blew up a car that came too close on Thursday. </p> <p>For the next two days, a tense group of about 200 journalists milled around the Palace of Culture, a cinema where officials gave press conferences. The information came out in dribs and drabs, not much of it credible. Mobile phone coverage was patchy, many people switching to the local network or satphones. </p> <p>Up until Friday morning - the final day of the siege - official spokesmen had left the total of hostages at 354 - perhaps a quarter of the final total. It was a tacit admission the casualty figures would be high. During one such announcement, the crowd jeered the official, unable to tolerate the falsehoods any more. </p> <p>There was little for relatives to do other than talk anxiously to the media. Many were hard to talk to: the Caucasus mentality is strictly private in grief. Some were angered by the intrusion. </p> <p>I ended up staying with a local family. It was Thursday night, and I had a low battery on my laptop and an imminent deadline. I knocked on a random door and the grandmother let me use their electric socket. The son, Gior, 13, was edgy. His mother was inside the school, as was his sister, aged seven (they are both safe now). He had been expelled from the school recently for bullying. They offered me their couch. </p> <p>The mother and father were local law enforcement officials. My host, who insisted on getting me very drunk the night after the siege and his wife's release, used his status to get me access and introduce me to families who would otherwise have kept mum. At one point, my host was discussing the siege in his kitchen with two friends. I interrupted him to correct him over the timing of the first explosion in the school. He looked at me and grinned: \"You see. He wrote it all down,\" he told his friends. He saw the press as the only chance of hearing the truth about what happened at Beslan. </p> <p>On Friday, at 13:05, I was near the local administration building when a huge blast shook the floor. Then another; then gunfire; the blasts and gunfire kept getting nearer. \"It\" had clearly started. The living bodies of children, covered in someone else's blood and their own grime, were carried out via the gaps between the buildings. One policeman said there had been an explosion, that no gunmen had died and hostages had. I approached a normally charming senior Kremlin press aide to ask in Russian if the siege had officially started. He looked at me, furious and panicked. \"Be gone\", he screamed, pointing the way out. </p> <p>Thirty minutes later I moved round to where the school meets the railway line. There stood two Russian tanks and one uptight spetznaz soldier. While he insisted I leave, the local militia goons, sweaty men in tracksuits carrying hunting rifles, asked if I wanted to hang out with them, 10 metres away from the school. I was soon dragged away. </p> <p>At the Palace of Culture, the cordon that once held us back had disappeared. The small paths down from the school had become a shuttle service for stretchers. Those carrying casualties were greeted with little bar cameras, a few emergency workers, sequestered cars, and some anxious locals. Three days in, the press had managed to get there from London, but the Russian government had not managed to create a proper triage system. </p> <p>It was a mess. Bodies were dumped on the grass verge. Some journalists tried to do live broadcasts, while others ducked behind walls. I noticed a column of local men heading up one path towards the school itself and followed. A series of garages provided some cover about 10 metres to the left of the school courtyard. Here I met the Telegraph, the Baltimore Sun and a Sky News cameraman. </p> <p>Locals were everywhere - be they militia or anxious parents. Throughout the siege, western television - CNN, BBC, Sky - carried live footage. But Russian state TV - and even local TV - used live and pre-recorded shots that they played in hourly bulletins. The people of Beslan had to go to the site of the siege to follow what was happening. </p> <p>Anarchy ruled. The federal government sent in their finest special forces to fight, but did not use their plentiful conscripts to erect a protective cordon for their operation. Half an hour after the Dubrovka theatre siege in Moscow two years ago, I had to barge authoritatively through a line of tired conscripts to reach the front of the theatre to see the triage. I was also detained as I tried to leave the siege site. </p> <p>Here, 90 minutes into the siege, there was no line to cross and only your judgment held you back. It was possible to walk through one garage, whose back wall had been punctured to provide an escape route for hostages, and see the school's yard. I walked round to the front of the school where the fighting was most intense and hid behind a wall, ducking low behind a crowd of large, tall men, gaping as if they were at a football match. One stray round caused the gaggle to step back. But then some, a few in tracksuits, a few in smocks, strolled in a column down one wall that linked the garages to the gym, the site of the massacre. </p> <p>The siege was ongoing, but had apparently moved to the back of the school. Few stray rounds were hitting the courtyard now. I feared access to the scene would be impossible later, so I headed towards the gym. </p> <p>Seen from the gym door, the floor contained nothing recognisable except roof material and some black mulch. It had clearly been completely destroyed. I crossed over to the other side of the courtyard. I moved down to the other side of the gym where a Russian cameraman and photographer joined local militia and spetznaz. </p> <p>More bodies were being brought out of the window. Inside, the walls were blown plasterless. </p> <p>At 16:30, the stream of corpses coming from the school was still endless. The gunfire and blasts were still constant. My desk insisted that I start writing at 17:00. The gunfire continued, but I left and interviewed my host's wife, who had a detailed grasp of events inside the gym. </p> <p>I had seen enough.</p>",
  "It's a long way from Brussels to Diyarbakir, dusty capital of Turkey's remote south-east, so Guenter Verheugen, the EU's German commissioner for enlargement, got a red-carpet welcome last week when he flew in to assess how things are going as the moment of truth approaches. <p>Turks have been straining to hitch their wagon to Europe for 40 years, and it is finally about to happen. Next month, the commission will say that they have met the political criteria for membership; governments are expected to follow suit in December. This is a very big deal: no country that has begun negotiations on joining the club has failed, eventually, to make the grade. Actual membership could be 10 or more years away, and by then there will be 80 million-plus Turks. With voting power tied to population size under the new EU constitution, Ankara will be as important a player as Berlin, Paris and London. </p> <p>Yet this is about much more than how a Europe of 28-plus countries will work: as a secular democracy whose citizens are mostly Muslim, Turkey could be a beacon for Islamic and Arab countries stunted by underdevelopment, human-rights abuses and fundamentalism - and which still have lessons to learn from Ataturk's revolutionary separation of mosque and state. </p> <p>The prime minister, the conservative Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has pushed ahead with political, judicial and economic reforms while powerful generals have had their wings clipped, allowing flexibility over Cyprus. The prospect of being in \"Europe\" has been a big spur to change, on both sides of the Bosphorus. </p> <p>Not all the news is good. As Verheugen rightly warned, implementation of new laws on Kurdish language rights and on torture has been slow and patchy. And there is dismay at Erdogan's ill-conceived and domestically controversial support for a law banning adultery, a family-values issue for his supporters. </p> <p>Turks already have a hard time facing down the sort of prejudice expressed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whose elegant circumlocutions about \"cultural differences\" are only slightly less offensive than the cruder view of another clever Frenchman, Voltaire, who called the Turks a reminder to Christians to atone for their sins. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, support for Turkish membership is weakest in France (16%, according to the German Marshall Fund), and many believe accession talks should not begin until after the country's risky referendum on the EU constitution. But hostility is strong too in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands: another Brussels commissioner, the Dutchman Frits Bolkestein, spoke darkly of the \"Islamisation\" of Europe if Turkey joins - a betrayal of Christendom's historic victory over the Ottomans at the gates of Vienna in 1683. That's hardly the right sort of message to send to the 12 million Muslims who are already European citizens. </p> <p>Turks know a long haul lies ahead, and are prepared to be patient. But Erdogan is hardly being alarmist in signalling a dangerous backlash if the EU's \"yes\" is anything other than unequivocal. </p> <p>Complicating this question is heavy pressure from the US to embrace its veteran (though no longer automatically compliant) Nato ally and strategically placed neighbour of Iraq, Iran and Syria. Resentful Europeans counter that the EU is not a military alliance but a union of democracies sharing some sovereignty - and wonder out loud how George Bush would react if Jacques Chirac kept urging him to accept Mexico as the 51st state. Transatlantic tensions are inescapable these days. But they should not be the deciding factor here: if the EU is indeed a community of values as well as a huge market and aspiring global player, then a warm welcome for a rapidly changing Turkey should be beyond doubt. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Business is brisk in GF White's family butchers, but the talk is slow. Aylsham, a market town in Norfolk, will this week become the second small community in the country to join Cittaslow, the international network of \"slow cities\". </p> <p>It will not be the last. Since Ludlow became the first town in the English-speaking world to embrace the Italian philosophy and practice of Cittaslow earlier this year, hundreds of other communities across the UK have been waking up to the concept, and pleasures, of a slow town. </p> <p>Queueing for smoked chicken and homemade chutney, Val Wilson, who is about to move into the area, is all for Cittaslow. \"When I first came here years ago, somebody was wearing a badge saying 'don't rush me, I'm from Norfolk'. That's a very positive thing in today's can't stop, can't talk life.\" </p> <p>Cittaslow is not about creating museum towns where time stands still. First introduced in Italy by a local mayor in 1999, it aims to halt the spread of clone communities with identikit supermarkets, and dead dormitory towns where lonely commuters lead separate lives. More than 100 towns in 10 countries have now joined the network. </p> <p>It grew out of the slow - as opposed to fast - food movement, which was born in Italy in 1986, and now has 80,000 members in 104 countries. Like the slow food philosophy, Cittaslow promotes the health benefits of eating local produce and encourages trade in locally-grown foods to create a healthy town economy. It is a concept enthusiastically welcomed by Crawford White, 32, who recently took over GF White from his father. His grandfather founded the business. </p> <p>Mr White knows both his local suppliers and his customers intimately. He will check on the health of a particular bullock if he feels the need, and provides a truly personal service, from slaughtering and butchering customers' own livestock to offering to rub the arthritic knee of an old lady purchasing traditional pork sausages. </p> <p>He hopes Cittaslow's philosophy, and its practical measures to improve the town centre, will put a smile on people's faces, and stave off the ever-present threat that a supermarket giant could open up round the corner. </p> <p>\"It will enhance Aylsham. You go to Spain or France and, in the centre of the village, there are trees and people sitting about. It would be nice to see a more relaxed atmosphere here, with people enjoying shopping rather than going 'Oh hell, let's get this over with'.\" </p> <p>Norfolk born and bred, Liz Jones, a local councillor who manages Aylsham's charity shop, was initially suspicious of Cittaslow. \"I'm very anti-bureaucracy and I wasn't convinced it was good for Aylsham,\" she said. \"The name puts you off. You think of a hick town somewhere in the backwoods.\" </p> <p>Her view changed when she visited Ludlow, which was awarded slow town status by the Italian movement earlier this year. \"It suddenly clicked. Aylsham is already a Cittaslow place because of its history, community involvement and small independent shops. Cittaslow can take us forward.\" </p> <p>Five years ago, Aylsham, a community of 5,900 people, was \"teetering\", according to Giles Margarson, who has lived in the area all his life and is now involved in Cittaslow. </p> <p>\"Aylsham looked very sad and tired, and was at risk of turning into a dormitory town for the city [Norwich],\" said Susan Flack of the Aylsham Partnership, a coalition of the local council and town trade and community groups which is helping to introduce the concept. \"It was in danger of losing that market town buzz it had.\" </p> <p>But the town has rallied and now boasts more than 200 clubs, from the quilters to the ramblers. Crucially, apart from its banks and two very small foodstores, Aylsham still has no big chains; its bustle is based around local shops and family businesses. </p> <p>A farmers' market has been started in addition to the town's legendary auction house, which holds weekly sales of everything from antique chairs to rolls of rusty barbed wire. On auction day, the old boys still come in from the countryside and gather to gossip, leaning on their trucks. Cittaslow aims to consolidate the revitalisation of Aylsham. The movement has explicit practical goals to improve small towns: promoting composting and recycling, reducing noise pollution, removing unsightly advertisements, providing free public toilets, preserving historic buildings and ensuring there are parks and places to sit. </p> <p>While some locals mutter they don't need things any slower, the Cittaslow enthusiasts in the town hope to encourage residents to get involved in community activities and buy local goods, particularly the young families and those who commute 15 miles to Norwich for work. </p> <p>\"It is about having a community life in the town, so people don't come home from work, shut their doors and that's it,\" said Mrs Flack. \"It is not slow as in yokel. It is slow as opposed to frantic. It is about quality of life and caring about the community.\" </p> <p>Having received approval from Ludlow and Italy to join the Cittaslow network, the movement in Aylsham also has clear practical goals: calming traffic, sorting out the congested marketplace, providing better parking, and ensuring the swimming pool stays open. </p> <p>Alison Cundall, who chairs Ludlow Cittaslow, is already seeing the effect on her town, which is brimming with ideas, from offering food hygiene training for young people to using the river to power small renewable energy projects. \"It has been reassuring to a lot of people. Ludlow is not going to become a faceless high street.\" </p> <p>\"I think Cittaslow will spread like wildfire,\" said Mrs Flack. \"But it has to come from the grassroots and not be offered from the outside as a salvation for all your problems.\"</p>",
  "Democrats made a small gain in the Hong Kong legislative council elections yesterday, exit polls indicated, but failed to meet their expectations. <p>They had portrayed the elections as a virtual referendum on the right to vote, but a sex scandal, Beijing's carrot-and-stick policies and the complicated voting system kept their gains in check. </p> <p>\"I am disappointed. It shows how unacceptable the electoral system is,\" said Martin Lee, a former chairman of the Democratic party. </p> <p>Supporters of democracy seemed certain to have increased their 17 of the 30 directly elected seats by at least one, the television exit polls suggested. Supporters of Beijing were projected to increase their share from seven to nine seats. </p> <p>The other 30 seats on the council are indirectly elected by professional and business groups. </p> <p>Eleven have been returned unopposed, the other results are not yet known, but the bloc has been dominated since the return to Chinese rule in 1997 by supporters of the Communist government in Beijing, which nominates the territory's chief executive and has ruled against early steps towards greater democracy. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands demonstrated against that decision on July 1, giving the Democrats hope of increased support. </p> <p>But Tsang Yok-hing, a former chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, said yesterday: \"The message we got from voters in the past few weeks is many want ... a stable, harmonious environment.\" </p> <p>The high turnout - about 53%, which equalled the 1998 record, had been expected to favour the Democrats. </p> <p>The official results are due today. In the previous chamber the democracy camp held 22 seats and the Beijing group 34; the rest were held by independents. </p> <p>Support for the democrats began to sag after a Democratic party council member, Ho Wai-to, was arrested in southern China last month and held for six months for allegedly hiring a prostitute. </p> <p>He has not been re-elected, and some Democrats suspected that the incident was set-up by Beijing to smear him. </p> <p>The winners include the maverick Marxist \"Long Hair\" Leung Kwok-hung, who has taken every opportunity to heckle the chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa. </p> <p>\"I'll demonstrate my electorate's dissatisfaction towards this minority-chosen government by protesting in the council in my special way,\" he said last night. <br><b>Reuters</b></p>",
  "<b> How does the electoral system work? </b> <p>Hong Kong's byzantine electoral system was devised by the British to limit the influence of democracy advocates under colonial rule, and it continues to do so under Chinese rule. Industries, professions and other groups choose half the 60 seats in the legislature...the 30 remaining seats will be chosen...by geographical constituency this year...But to limit the dominance of democracy advocates, the territory has been divided into five large, multi-seat districts. A system of proportional representation is used...for each of these districts, so a party can capture a seat even if it wins as little as one-tenth of the vote. </p> <p> Keith Bradsher in the New York Times, September 6 </p> <p> <b> Who are the major parties and how are they viewed? </b> </p> <p>The main pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong...[has] a long history of subservience to the party line, dating back to the Cultural Revolution... Meanwhile, the democratic camp is vulnerable to the accusation that its policies on issues other than the constitution and autonomy from Beijing are either imprecise or aimed more at above-average earners. </p> <p> Philip Bowring in the International Herald Tribune, September 10 </p> <p> <b> Why were the elections important? </b> </p> <p>[There has been] a dramatic rise in the stakes in Hong Kong politics since July 1 last year when 500,000 people took to the streets to protest against the administration of Beijing-appointed Tung Chee-hwa...That \"people-power\" demonstration - followed by another one on July 1 this year - has alarmed China. </p> <p> From the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, September 10 </p> <p> <b> Why are Hong Kong's democrats angry? </b> </p> <p>Beijing stipulated [on April 26] that...Hong Kong cannot pick its chief executive by direct elections in 2007 and cannot expand direct elections for its legislative council in 2008. The decision...outraged many...who had hoped to move swiftly along the path to full democracy.

Analysts say any upset of that arrangement would dilute Beijing's control over the city, possibly paralysing legislation.

  "<p>The heaviest fighting for months erupted in the centre of Baghdad yesterday, only a brief stroll from the office of the prime minister, Ayad Allawi. Witnesses said at least 13 Iraqis were killed and 55 wounded after US helicopters attacked a crowd of unarmed demonstrators dancing round a burning Bradley armoured vehicle. </p> <p>Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, a Guardian journalist who writes a fortnightly column for G2 and contributes to the main paper, had stitches to his head after being injured in the violence. </p> <p>One of those killed was the correspondent for the Arabic channel Al Arabiya, Mazen al-Tumeizi. Al Arabiya yesterday broadcast videotape of the correspondent doing his report for the camera. Suddenly, an explosion occurred behind him and he doubled over. </p> <p>A Reuters cameraman, Seif Fouad, recording the scene, was also wounded in the blast. \"I looked at the sky and saw a helicopter at very low altitude,\" he told Reuters. \"Just moments later I saw a flash of light from the Apache, then a strong explosion. Mazen's blood was on my camera and face,\" Mr Fouad said from his hospital bed. He added that his friend screamed: \"Seif, Seif! I'm going to die. I'm going to die.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's violence in the capital appeared to be a coordinated assault: resistance fighters lobbed dozens of mortars into the Green Zone, the fortified compound housing Mr Allawi's interim government and the US embassy. The crackle of gunfire echoed for several hours in central Baghdad. Insurgents then used a car bomb to attack an American patrol that went to investigate, and the US helicopters fired into the crowd. </p> <p>Witnesses said the fighting in Haifa Street - a notoriously volatile area hostile to the US occupation - started at 3am. </p> <p>\"We don't know whether it was the Americans or the Iraqis who started it,\" Abu Adil said. \"Several mortars were fired at 7am and then a car bomb blew up the tank. After the tank exploded a helicopter started shooting at us. We all ran.\" </p> <p>In a statement last night, the US military said: \"As the helicopters flew over the burning Bradley they received small-arms fire from the insurgents in vicinity of the vehicle.\" </p> <p>Earlier, the US military had said a helicopter destroyed the vehicle \"to prevent looting and harm to the Iraqi people\", after four US soldiers were wounded in the attack on the Bradley. </p> <p>Reports put the death toll across Iraq yesterday at between 60 and 100. The health ministry said the worst casualties were in the capital, where 37 were killed, and in Tal Afar, near the Syrian border, where 51 people died after US troops mounted a large offensive. </p> <p>Three Polish soldiers died and three others were wounded in an ambush near the Iraqi city of Hilla. \"We've seen a tremendous increase in the number of attacks,\" Brigadier General Erv Lessel, a US military spokesman, told the Reuters news agency. </p> <p>Tawhid and Jihad, a militant group linked to al-Qaida and led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said it carried out yesterday's coordinated campaign of violence in Baghdad. </p> <p>In an acknowledgement of the extent of the insurgency, which has led to loss of control of at least three towns, including Falluja, Mr Allawi pledged at the weekend that the January election would go ahead even if some Iraqis could not vote. </p> <p>He said: \"If for any reason 300,000 people cannot have an election, cannot vote because terrorists decide so, then frankly 300,000 people ... is not going to alter 25 million people voting,\" he said. </p> <p>The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, acknowledged that the US-led coalition faced difficulties, but said the Bush administration was committed to making Iraq stable. </p> <p>Mr Allawi said Saddam Hussein was expected to go on trial before the end of the year, before the country's first elections since the US invasion. He hoped the trial, which had not been expected until next year, would offer an olive branch to thousands of Ba'ath party members, and help draw the sting from an insurgency which shows no sign of abating. </p> <p>He said that putting Saddam on trial would draw \"a line between those who committed crimes against the Iraqi people when Saddam was around and the rest who had to join the Ba'ath party to live, or believed in the ideology\". </p> <p>Of those Ba'ath members who did not commit crimes, he added: \"We are not interested in pursuing them. They should be part of the civil society in Iraq, part of the political process in the future.\" </p> <p>Saddam, who was captured last December after eight months on the run, appeared in court in June to face initial charges of war crimes and mass executions. Court officials have said that drawing up evidence was taking time, but Mr Allawi said his trial would now be \"most probably before the elections\" due in January. Other former regime officials are expected to face trial first. </p> <p>According to a report in the Sunday Times, Tariq Aziz, Saddam's former foreign minister, has agreed to give evidence against the ousted dictator. </p> <p>A British official in Baghdad said Mr Allawi would pay his first official visit to Britain \"within weeks\".</p>",
  "There are boom times ahead at the Christian Soldier gun shop, a small emporium with a wide array of lethal weapons and a display window advertising its telephone number: 661-AMMO. <p>At midnight tonight, a 10-year federal ban on some types of assault weapons will almost certainly expire, and the proprietor of Christian Soldier, Rob Shiflett, expects a stream of customers for newly legal civilian versions of AK-47s and M-16s. </p> <p>\"I am sure there are going to be a lot of people who couldn't buy one the first time around, and there are going to be a lot of people buying them as investments, just in case there is a ban again one day,\" he says. </p> <p>Mr Shiflett, a former army doctor, has received about a hundred queries from interested buyers. \"People are going to want the true military rifle,\" he says. </p> <p>There are 1.5m assault weapons in private hands in America. Gun enthusiasts describe them as collectibles, no different from other military memorabilia. Supporters of gun control say they are the weapon of choice for drug dealers and gangs, and that many have been used in the killing of police officers. </p> <p>The ban, enacted under Bill Clinton, outlawed Uzis, AK-47s, and other brands of guns produced after 1994; accessories that made rapid firing easier (such as higher capacity ammunition clips, pistol grips and folding stocks); and silencers. Guns that incorporated the banned features but that were manufactured before 1994 remained legal. </p> <p>America's gun makers soon found ways to exploit this weakness, increasing their output before the ban went into effect, and producing weapons that were very slightly adjusted to comply with the regulations. </p> <p>\"They just banned the cosmetic features,\" says Sanford Abrams, the owner of Valley Gun, down the road from Mr Shiflett's shop in Baltimore. On the rack behind him are about 25 types of assault rifle, all perfectly legal. Most sell for between $1,000 and $1,500 (\u00a3560-\u00a3830). There is an Uzi in the back of the shop, also legal because of loopholes in the law; and, 10 years after the ban on high-capacity magazines went into effect, Mr Abrams still has an almost inexhaustible supply. </p> <p>Even so, gun control advocates argue that the ban produced a dramatic decline in the use of assault guns in crimes over the last decade. </p> <p>\"In the late 80s and early 90s, the industry was relentlessly marketing its guns to criminals,\" said Eric Howard, of the Brady Centre to Prevent Gun Violence. \"When the ban came into effect in 1994 it really put the brakes on this industry.\" </p> <p>Gun ownership is a highly charged issue in America, and the National Rifle Association, the pre-eminent gun lobbying organisation, is one of the country's most powerful inter est groups. Even so, in a country which has strenuously resisted efforts to control the spread of guns, the ban on assault weapons was relatively uncontroversial. </p> <p>In an opinion poll last week by the Annenberg Public Policy Centre, 68% of Americans supported an extension of the ban, including 32% of members of the NRA. It also has the support of police federations. </p> <p>When he was running for president, George Bush, too, supported its renewal. But he has put no pressure on Congress to renew the ban. </p> <p>Gun control advocates say the expiry of the ban will encourage arms manufacturers to ramp up production and put more guns on the street. The makers of one popular assault rifle were last week taking advance orders. </p> <p>Lobby groups have taken out full-page newspaper advertisements showing Osama bin Laden clutching an assault rifle, and warning: \"Any terrorist in the US will be free to walk into any gun shop, and buy an AK-47, Uzi or other rapid-fire military-style killing machine.\" </p> <p>But Mr Abrams says: \"These guns don't get into terrorist hands. Abdul is not going to come in here and go through a background check saying he wants to buy a semi-assault weapon.\" </p> <p>The gun lobby and gun control advocates agree on one thing: the price of assault weapons will fall dramatically. </p> <p>Once production gets under way, and new models of the formerly banned weapons such as AK-47s are on the market, Mr Shiflett is going to have to sell off his old stock at cost price to make space for the authentic new models.</p>",
  "<p>Joseph Chamberlain had a vision for Birmingham, but Labour's new five-year plan for education is yet another paradigm shift towards central state control and will usher in the virtual abolition of the local education authority (Learn from Victorians, September 8). </p> <p>David Miliband relies on the testing regime to provide selective evidence for school improvement (the Victorians abolished payment by results for teachers).

  "<p>Whether sipping a cappuccino on the way to work this morning, or enjoying the more modest delights of a cup of instant, there is the promise of some good news for coffee drinkers - or good news for those who care as much for their conscience as they do whether their lattes are skinny or double decaf. A landmark agreement between some of the world's largest coffee producers, retailers - including Nestl\u00e9 - trade unions and NGOs offers to introduce minimum standards and labour rights into the industry. That would be good news for the 25 million workers and farmers in the many developing countries such as Guatemala and Vietnam who have suffered from the brutal competition to supply the west with its regular caffeine fix. </p> <p>The Common Code for the Coffee Community, as the agreement is known, promises that its signatories will pay minimum wages, ban the use of child labour, allow union membership and adhere to international standards on environmental protection. Independent auditors will check compliance, and make regular reports. The adoption of the code at last brings something of the moral force of the fairtrade movement into the mainstream, in an echo of John Maynard Keynes' declaration: \"Proper economic prices should be fixed not at the lowest possible level, but at the level sufficient to provide producers with proper nutritional and other standards in the conditions in which they live ... it is in the interests of all producers that the price of a commodity should not be depressed beyond this level, and consumers are not entitled to expect that it should.\" </p> <p>Yet while the code will aid fairer trade, it is not fairtrade in a strict sense. While it will help farm workers' incomes, it does not address the longterm fall in coffee prices and the glut in production that have depressed their sale values. The agreement also avoids any mention of genetically modified coffee plants, thus missing an ideal opportunity to tackle the issue. But even so, the common code would be a step in the right direction by the international coffee industry, to removing coffee's bitter taste.</p>",
  "Tony Blair has revived a noble, if slightly amateurish, tradition in British politics. A new book by a former No 10 adviser declares that the prime minister has such a poor grasp of economics that one official advised him to swot up with the help of textbooks. <p>The judgment, by Derek Scott, allows Mr Blair to take his place alongside the late prime minister, Alec Douglas-Home, who cheerfully admitted that he relied on \"matchsticks\" to understand the nation's finances. </p> <p>Mr Blair, who rarely appears at ease when discussing economics in detail, is said to be deeply unamused by the suggestion that he struggles to understand technical areas which are grasped with ease by his great foe, Gordon Brown. But Mr Scott, who is no fan of the chancellor, writes in his book that his job as economics adviser to the prime minister often saw him acting as a tutor. </p> <p>In Off Whitehall, to be published on Thursday, Mr Scott writes: \"I saw one of my tasks as being to make Blair more at ease with some broader economic issues. I was more successful in some areas than others. </p> <p>\"During a trip to South America in 2001 he failed to read either the Treasury's or my own economic brief and it showed in some of his comments. So much so that a well-meaning official asked him whether he would like some economic textbooks to be included in his reading material for the forthcoming summer holiday. The normally genial premier didn't think this suggestion very funny.\" </p> <p>The remarks by Mr Scott, whose disclosures about the tensions between the prime minister and chancellor stoked the fires yesterday, echoes a consistent, though muted, criticism of the prime minister. As an Oxford law graduate, he has never been as well versed in economics as Mr Brown, even though Mr Blair's first frontbench job in the early 1980s was as a shadow Treasury minister. </p> <p>Mr Blair's holiday reading usually consists of worthy - but not academic - biographies. In the summer before the 9/11 attacks he was absorbed in a history of Kemal Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey. Mr Brown, by contrast, cannot wait to get his hands on academic tomes on holiday and likes nothing better than to immerse himself in the works of such heavyweight thinkers as Noam Chomsky. </p> <p>Mindful of Mr Brown's greater grasp of economics, Mr Blair handed the future chancellor an unprecedented degree of control over economic matters in the notorious \"Granita deal\" of 1994. Once in office, this came back to haunt Mr Blair who was placed in the humiliating position of having to beg his chancellor for details of his budgets, according to Mr Scott. </p> <p>A month before the 1998 budget, the chancellor was summoned to No 10 to explain his thinking. After a 20-minute monologue, a tactic reportedly dismissed by Mr Blair as \"speaking clock mode\", the prime minister interrupted to ask gently: \"Gordon, what about the budget?\" </p> <p>Mr Scott writes: \"The chancellor, pulling his bundle of papers tightly to his chest, growled: 'I haven't made my mind up yet.' The prime minister, leaning forward from the couch on which he was sitting, eyebrows raised with a disarming smile and head tipping slightly from side to side in the manner portrayed by Rory Bremner, simply said: 'Give us a hint, Gordon'.\" </p> <p>Such behaviour astonished Mr Scott. \"I can think of no other prime minister who would have put up with such behaviour.\" </p> <p>The disclosures by Mr Scott, who describes the chancellor as \"obstructive and deceitful\" in his dealings with No 10, are likely to add fuel to the fire after one of the worst weeks in the Blair-Brown saga. But both occupants of Downing Street went out of their way yesterday to dismiss the book. Mr Scott's decision to rush into print has irritated both men, with No 11 alarmed by the propensity of Blair aides to speak out against the chancellor. </p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"These accusations from a former No 10 aide do not warrant serious comment.\" A No 10 source said: \"We have nothing to say because if we did it would further publicise this book.\" </p> <p>One Whitehall source was even more dismissive. \"It is a shame for poor Derek. The problem was the prime minister never invited him to any of his meetings. So it is a second-hand account of meetings he was not at and conversations he never witnessed.\" </p> <p>Both sides attempted to take a lofty view because Mr Scott's book - serialised in yesterday's Sunday Times - does mark a mildly significant moment. It is the first time the Blair-Brown feuding has been recorded in public by a member of staff from inside Downing Street. </p> <p>Lord Healey, who employed Mr Scott as an adviser when he was chancellor in the 1970s said: \"What is true is that he [Tony Blair] has given Gordon a pretty free hand. But that is very sensible because Gordon is absolutely first rate. I see no sign that he [Tony Blair] is an idiot on economics.\" </p> <p>Denzil Davies, the Labour MP for Llanelli and ex-Treasury minister in the Healey era who has one of the sharpest economic minds at Westminster, understood the Scott criticisms. \"I have noticed over the years that Blair, who is a highly intelligent guy, seems to be turned off by economics. He seems to be less interested in it than other prime ministers.\" </p> <p>But Mr Davies believes the prime minister could master economics if he applied his mind. \"You have got to be focused on economics and something's got to make you become focused on it. Some people have a seat-of-the-pants flair for it. But I am sure the prime minister could grasp it if he had to. But he probably felt that he never had to, or that Gordon would do it. Maybe New Labour believes in leaving economics to the market place.\" </p> <p><b>Matchstick men and expert hands</b></p> <p>Tony Blair has joined a select group of prime ministers whose grasp of economics would have left them struggling in an A-level exam.

  "Police are being denied permission to search Ian Brady's room for photographs which may yield clues to where the body of one of the Moors murder victims is buried, it emerged yesterday. <p>Keith Bennett disappeared in 1964, aged 10. Despite extensive searches of Saddleworth Moor, where the other victims were buried, his remains have not been found. </p> <p>Alan Bennett, the missing boy's brother, said: \"They told us it's a question of Brady's rights. What about Keith's rights?\" </p> <p>Greater Manchester police, who had sought a warrant after an investigation into letters and photographs left by Myra Hindley, Brady's accomplice, after her death in November 2002, found they had secretly hoarded images of the graves long after they were convicted. But the warrant was refused because of an obscure legal technicality: it cannot be issued because there is no longer a possibility Brady would be charged over Keith Bennett's death. </p> <p>\"There were a lot of very unhappy people around here when we were told we couldn't search Brady's cell,\" said a murder squad detective. </p> <p>Malcolm MacCulloch, who was Brady's psychiatrist and is now the editor of the British Journal of Forensic Psychiatry, examined hundreds of documents following Hindley's death, including her unpublished autobiography. He also looked at 200 photos taken at the time of the Moors murders, and said that they showed burial sites. </p> <p>Professor MacCulloch found that, over a number of years, Brady made repeated and insistent demands for a handful of the photos, which were being stored by Hindley's mother, Nellie. </p> <p>Letters from her show that over seven years Brady made repeated demands for slide copies of five specific photos. Hindley wrote to her mother: \"He's got a new hand viewer, and he's looking forward to receiving them.\" </p> <p>Prof MacCulloch said: \"He asks for the pictures not only frequently, but insistently. And that is consistent with them having a special meaning to him - and the only meaning I can think of is burial sites.\" </p> <p>Nellie only supplied the copies when her daughter threatened her, stating: \"He says he'll have to send someone around to get them.\" </p> <p>The psychiatrist said it was common for serial killers to keep mementoes: \"People like Brady hoard objects which remind them of what they have done, so they can relive the event - it can be hair, body parts, or photos.\" </p> <p>In order to establish which photos, the police asked GCHQ to look for coded messages in the letters between the Moors murderers. These were copied and stored by the prison authorities. They also examined poetry in which Hindley admitted to hiding messages about harming children. </p> <p>\"We got the code - the problem is that the messages are meaningless to anyone other than the Moors murderers,\" a murder squad officer said. \"There's nothing that says 'X marks the spot'.\" </p> <p>The couple were sentenced to life for the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10, John Kilbride, 14, and Edward Evans, 17. It was not until the mid-1980s that they confessed they had killed two more children. The remains of Pauline Reade, 16, were recovered - but those of Keith Bennett have never been found. </p> <p>The families of both victims have previously called for Brady and Hindley's prosecution, but this was blocked by the director of public prosecutions, who said a new trial would be a waste of money as there was no prospect of either ever being released. </p> <p>Greater Manchester police have now hired an expert image analyst to look at all of Brady's pictures for images marking the grave of Keith Bennett. They have also ordered the analysis of water samples from Saddleworth Moor for traces of a decomposing body. </p> <p>Keith's elderly mother, Winnie Johnson, says she wants nothing more than to find her son and give him a proper burial. The police say there is little they can do without new evidence to show them where to dig. </p> <p>Earlier this year, as the 40th anniversary of her son's murder approached, she wrote to the home secretary, David Blunkett, asking him to order a fresh search. </p> <p>Keith set out to walk a short distance to his grandmother's home in Manchester on June 16 1964. He never arrived. </p> <p>Hindley's photos show Ian Brady in his suit and slippers, and her dressed in leather. The archive gives mundane reminders of an extraordinary life: Hindley's confirmation prayer book, an insurance document for the car she and Brady used to abduct children, and the gold-plated watch he gave her for her 21st birthday. </p> <p>Much of her autobiography is a self-serving account of a northern working-class upbringing: gas lamps, outside toilets, picking coal from railway tracks, and playing marbles. It seeks to explain what turned a Catholic girl into a woman capable of the Moors murders. </p> <p>Hindley's relationship with her violent father is central: he beat both her mother and her, and taught Myra to street fight at an early age. </p> <p>Prof MacCulloch believes this shaped her character. \"People who have been brutalised - either emotionally or physically, or sexually, or a combination of all three - develop abnormal personalities with elements of cruelty or sadism later on,\" he noted. </p> <p>Hindley claims Brady corrupted her faith, and introduced her to the writings of the Marquis de Sade and Nazism. </p> <p>After their conviction in 1966, the Moors murderers took legal action forcing the return of negatives of photos not connected to the known murders. Two years later, 200 images were handed to Hindley's mother for safe-keeping. </p> <p>Prof MacCulloch says that having control of Keith Bennett allows Brady to view himself as the winner. </p> <p>\"Final control is the possession of the body,\" he added. \"I know you don't know, and I'm not going to tell you.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Moors Murder Code, BBC2 Wednesday 9pm</p>",
  "<p>The big increase in behavioural and emotional problems among teenagers tracked in the Nuffield study will set the context for a debate this autumn on the plight of Britain's adolescents. </p> <p>The findings come ahead of two government initiatives - the Tomlinson report on education for 14- to 19-year-olds and the green paper on youth, responding to concern that Britain's education system and youth services are failing its young people. </p> <p>The troubled teenager has become a recurrent news item, with frequent reports of increases in self-harm and suicide as well as drug-taking and binge-drinking. But there has been scepticism about whether the problems were really increasing. </p> <p>There were also questions about whether the problem was about a small minority of adolescents, which was dragging the average down or a more widespread change in the experience of adolescence. </p> <p>The Nuffield study resolves some of those issues. The most academically rigorous time trend study of its kind, it went to great lengths to ensure it was comparing like with like from data collected in 1974, 1986 and 1999 based on parents' assessment of their teenagers' behaviour. </p> <p>Parents were asked to rate their children on a list of items which included fighting, bullying, stealing, lying, disobedience, fidgeting, misery, worries and fear of new situations. There were 10,499 in the first sample, 7,293 in the second and 868 in the third; all included similar proportions of girls and boys and covered the full spectrum of backgrounds. </p> <p>Contrary to a widespread perception, the study found no increase in aggressive behaviour, nor was there any increase in fidgeting or restlessness. </p> <p>To check for the possibility of parents being more likely to report a behavioural problem, the study looked at the follow-up adult surveys on the first two samples and found that behavioural problems increased their chances of detrimental outcomes as an adult, such as homelessness and losing a job. There was no equivalent check for the increase in emotional problems which may therefore be subject to an increased likelihood of parents' reporting. </p> <p>The study has provoked little surprise among professionals in this field who have widely suspected the trend was getting worse. The big question now is: what is causing the increase and why does Britain seem to have a particular problem? Here, professionals are divided. </p> <p>\"The average age of leaving home is 23 or 24, yet we still haven't caught up with that,\" said Ann Hagell, editor of the Journal of Adolescence. </p> <p>\"Young people are not really working, and not living in their own homes and the anticipation of that is distressing for teenagers. Add to that the reduction of employment levels of graduates. At 15 or 16, there's a real struggle ahead for five years over debt, how you are going to succeed and get settled. We have high expectations of responsibility, independence and academic achievement of our teenagers without the other side of the equation, giving them the means to achieve that. </p> <p>\"Some parents still have very traditional expectations of the life course of their children and at 16, they expect them to start making a contribution to family finances and give some thing back when there are few jobs available for that age group.\" </p> <p>Dr Hagell argues that while the financial dependence of children lasts longer than ever, there are many other areas of life in which children have unprecedented autonomy, for instance, sex. The clash can generate tension as parents are confused about when and how to exert authority. </p> <p>\"Transitions to adulthood are not just longer, they are also reversible - teenagers move out of the family to take a job but it doesn't work out and they have to move back home. All of that turbulence has become sharper,\" said Tom Wylie, chief executive of the National Youth Agency. </p> <p>The structure of the British secondary education system is a factor, argues Sharon Witherspoon, of the Nuffield Foundation. With one of the lowest rates of staying on past 16 in the developed world, the system offers little high quality vocational education. </p> <p>\"In the US, 80-85% of kids get a high school diploma. It's a more inclusive system than that of the UK. At the same time, the average high school has a big range of organised after-school activities ... which channel kids' energies. Part of the role of the school is the kind of socialisation that those activities generate, so that it's not just part of an academic gristmill.\" </p> <p>Such issues are part of the remit for Mike Tomlinson's report, due out next month, with options to reform a system which critics have long complained is oriented around A-levels and university entrance, thus setting up nearly 60% of children to fail. </p> <p>The research is also likely to trigger controversy on long- running debates such as the rise of single-parent families. </p> <p>Half of all children now experience the breakdown of their parents' relationship before they are 16. Although the study found comparable increases in all family types over the 25 years, there were more problems in single-parent families. </p> <p>Some experts argue that all families are now affected by the instability of family life, and it is the quality of the relationships within the family which determines how severely affected children are rather than its structure; children in intact two-parent families may be anxious about the possibility of divorce. </p> <p>\"The changing nature of the family is central. Teenagers are affected by instability of family life which causes a lot of difficulty; it muddles up roles, and there is not the support for young people as previously,\" said John Coleman, director of the Trust for the Study of Adolescence.</p>",
  "I first met Samira Bellil, who has died aged 31 from stomach cancer, at a grimy community centre in Marseille on Valentine's Day last year. She was small, with eyes that were surprisingly blue for a young French woman of Algerian origin, and corkscrew curls that I recognised from the cover of her book, Dans L'Enfer Des Tournantes (In The Hell Of Tournantes). <p>Published in 2002, it had made her immediately infamous, because it was the first time a young woman had dared to reveal the reality of life in the deprived ghettos - the banlieue - of French cities. In these suburbs, violence against young women was standard; gang rapes were endemic. They were not even called gang rapes, but tournantes, or pass-rounds, because the girl was passed around like a joint. </p> <p>Samira was first gang-raped when she was 14, when her boyfriend handed her over to three of his friends. They beat her viciously, raped her all night, and then made her breakfast. A month later, the most violent rapist, K, dragged her off a train by her hair, while other passengers looked the other way, and she was gang-raped again. These events made her, if not typical of a young woman of immigrant background in the suburbs, then not exceptional either. </p> <p>Samira was born to Algerian parents in Algiers, but her family soon moved to the Parisian suburb of Seine-Sainte-Denis. Her father was sent to jail almost immediately for what Samira later described as \"stupidities\", and she was fostered by a family in Belgium for five happy years, before being summoned back to her parents \"like a parcel\". She found her father violent and distant, and her home life was not happy. </p> <p>As a teenager, she started to go out, to meet boys, to rebel. It was dangerous behaviour, in a macho environment where a girl's reputation is sacred. A reputation could get you sent back to the bled, or homeland. Or worse: girls who dared to go out, wear make-up or drink were considered fair game for a tournante. When young women were told to behave, or they would end up in the basement, everyone knew what it meant. </p> <p>Samira did not report her rapes until two friends told her that K had raped them too. Reprisals are common - flats burned down, little sisters threatened - but Samira decided to prosecute. In the end, K was sentenced to eight years in prison. </p> <p>As she wrote in her book, she was condemned to a lot more. Her parents threw her out in shame, and her quartier, or neighbourhood, rejected her. \"People outside the estates don't know,\" she said. \"And everyone on the estate knows, but they won't say anything.\" There were years of drug abuse, squats, foster homes, despair. </p> <p>Eventually, she found a psychologist who helped her. She had years of therapy, and decided to write her book to show other young women that there was a way out. \"It's long and it's difficult, but it's possible,\" she wrote in the dedication - to \"my sisters in trouble\". She used her real name and put her photo on the cover, \"because,\" she said, \"my editor said I had a nice face\". She played it down, but it was courageous, especially as she still lived in the same quartier, and K lived there too. </p> <p>Samira was at the social centre in Marseille that day as part of a women's march organised by Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Slags Nor Doormats), the first organisation - which she had helped to found - to publicly address the issue of violence against young banlieue women. The march got attention; Samira's book had shocked France into acknowledging what was happening in its suburbs. </p> <p>Young women who were used to keeping quiet for fear of family pressure or worse, now stood up in packed community halls, finally telling the truth. At a public debate, a young man asked Samira what was wrong with gang bangs, anyway. She looked exhausted, but she responded characteristically. \"Firstly, mate,\" she said, looking at him, \"get it straight. It was not a gang bang. I was gang-raped. OK?\" Thanks to her book and her activism, the French government and the mayor's office in Paris began researching the problem of violence against young banlieue women, and her portrait was hung outside the French national assembly. </p> <p>Samira continued to speak out, though, as she told me when we met for an article I wrote on tournantes for Guardian Weekend last year, \"I can't carry all that violence forever\". She slowly found some peace, doing drama, which she loved, and working as a youth worker in her quartier; she said there were incredible people in the banlieue , and that despite everything, that was where she belonged. She was reconciled with her mother, and close to her two sisters, and she even decided that not all men are bastards, as she put it. </p> <p>She wanted to fall in love, be normal, but she didn't have time; after a life of violence, and a short period of respite, she was defeated by cancer. She deserved better.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Samira Bellil, writer, activist and youth worker, born November 27 1972; died September 4 2004</p>",
  "<p>When Brazilian president Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva visited Haiti last month to inspect some 1,200 of his troops leading a United Nations peacekeeping mission there, he did more than watch both countries' soccer teams play a game designed to bring much-needed cheer to the troubled Caribbean nation. </p> <p>The trip reinforced just how much new-found visibility Lula's two-year-old government has gained on the world stage and, combined with recent positive economic news in Brazil, made many ponder the president's potential future at home. </p> <p>Since winning Brazil's presidency by a large margin in 2002, the former union activist and pre-eminent figure within Brazil's Worker's party has re-cast his country's image abroad from that of \"the country of the future, always has been and always will be\" to one of a nation struggling concretely to get a handle on its economic and social ills while steering an independent and activist course in international affairs. </p> <p>In August, Brazil successfully led the G20 group of poor nations as it argued before the World Trade Organisation that subsidies paid to farmers by wealthy nations had priced the agricultural exports of other countries off the world market, miring nations like Brazil in persistent poverty. </p> <p>In April, the WTO sided with Brazil over a charge that cotton subsidies to US farmers were illegal because they artificially depressed world prices. </p> <p>Taken with Brazil's volunteering to lead the peacekeeping duties in Haiti and its role in negotiations to form the Mercosur trading bloc among South American countries, the Lula government has garnered significant praise from some of the same quarters that have lambasted Venezuela's left-leaning Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>On the domestic front, after undergoing an agonising 0.2% economic contraction in 2003, the Brazilian economy shows marked signs of picking up this year, a trend Lula's party will no doubt exploit to its fullest in municipal elections around the country scheduled for October. </p> <p>Brazil's economy expanded by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2004, a stunning leap beyond the year's first-quarter expansion rate of 2.7%. The Brazilian central bank opted to keep its benchmark lending rate at 16% on August 18 in an effort to blunt the spike of inflation and the rate, while still high, nevertheless represents a three-year low and far below the 26.5% with which Brazil began 2003. </p> <p>Lula is not without his problems. A law submitted to the Brazilian congress this month to set up a government-run journalism council, designed to accredit, regulate and censor reporters wishing to work in the country, has been denounced by local media professionals as smacking of the authoritarianism which characterised Brazil's 1964-85 military dictatorships. </p> <p>Inflation surged to a 15-month high in July, with consumer prices rising 0.91% after a 0.71% increase in June, which left the rate of price rises over the previous 12 months at 6.81%, up from 6.06% in June and including a 2.5% increase in petrol prices. </p> <p>The head of Brazil's central bank, former Fleet Boston Financial Corporation executive Henrique Meirelles, recently saw his position elevated to cabinet-level status despite being summoned before the Brazilian senate, accused of failing to declare all of his assets in his tax returns. </p> <p>Nevertheless, these difficulties are not seen as insurmountable. \"Lula's popularity is safe now as long as the economy and employment continue to grow,\" says Terry McCoy, director of the Latin American business environment programme at the University of Florida. \"Inflation does not seem to be a threat despite the recent uptick.\" </p> <p>The questions about Meirelles, while troubling, many say are likely have to reach a far higher pitch before they pose any significant danger to the administration. </p> <p>\"It's clear that there's something fishy going on, but not how bad it is,\" says David Samuels, author of Ambition, Federalism and Legislative Politics in Brazil. \"But this is not going to be the scandal that brings down Lula's government or forces Meirelles to resign. The supreme court is going to have to bring charges or even congress itself for this to stick.\" </p> <p>The question, it appears, is not whether the Worker's party will gain in the coming elections but how broad the margin of victory will be and how convincing a mandate it will provide for the Lula government. </p> <p>With analysts raising their predictions for overall 2004 growth for Brazil and the country having posted four successive quarters of positive economic movement, many observers are looking for the Brazilian president to come out of the ballot newly empowered to continue down the economic path he has blazed during his first two years in office.</p>",
  "The songwriter and record producer Billy Davis, who has died aged 72, was an important figure in the development of soul music. He worked with Jackie Wilson, Fontella Bass, Etta James and others, although his most widely known composition is probably I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke, a jingle written during his later career as a Madison Avenue advertising executive. <p>He was born Roquel Davis and was brought up by his grandmother in the Highland Park suburb of Detroit, near the Chrysler car plant. As a teenager, he sang with two vocal groups, the Thrillers and the Aims. He soon assumed the role of songwriter and manager to the Aims, who would later become world famous as the Four Tops. </p> <p>Through his friendship with Gwen Gordy, the cigarette concessionaire at a local club, Davis met her brother Berry, the future founder of Tamla Motown records, but then a car worker. The two men formed a songwriting partnership and successfully pitched their songs to Davis's second cousin Jackie Wilson, who had left the Dominoes in order to pursue a solo career. </p> <p>The first Davis-Gordy song Wilson recorded, Reet Petite, was a perfect foil for his versatile and acrobatic voice. Although it made little commercial impact in America, it was a top 10 hit in Britain in 1958, and topped the charts here when it was reissued in 1986. Davis and Gordy's other hits for Wilson included To Be Loved, Lonely Teardrops, That's Why (I Love You So) and I'll Be Satisfied. </p> <p>Davis and Gordy broke off their relationship with Wilson in 1959 after a dispute about royalties. Gordy concentrated on establishing Motown, while Davis ran the linked Anna label with Gwen and her sister. But he gradually felt sidelined at Motown and eagerly accepted an offer to join the staff of Chess Records of Chicago, which had previously bought songs from him. Chess was renowned for its blues and rock'n'roll acts, among them Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but now its owners, Leonard and Phil Chess, wanted to compete in the burgeoning soul music market. </p> <p>Davis brought his ability to create what he called \"pop-inflected but still soulful\" songs and a more rigorous attitude towards the recording process. He persuaded Leonard Chess to hire arrangers and a team of session musicians with a jazz background. One of these was Maurice White, later the leader of the group Earth, Wind And Fire. White said of Davis that \"he taught me how to break down a song and build it up again\". </p> <p>Among the soul classics that Davis produced for Chess in the early- and mid-1960s were All I Could Do Was Cry by Etta James (an \"eternal triangle\" song previously offered to Aretha Franklin, who was forbidden to sing it by her preacher father), Summertime by Billy Stewart, We're Gonna Make It by Little Milton, and Rescue Me by Fontella Bass. It was Davis who decided that Rescue Me should end with each instrument dropping out until only the voice was left. He was also responsible for Mitty Collier's highly regarded I Had A Talk With My Man Last Night, adapting the lyrics from a gospel number by the Rev James Cleveland. </p> <p>Davis also created radio commercials for Coca-Cola with Bass, Little Milton and others. These were so successful that McCann-Erickson, Coke's advertising agency, offered him a fulltime post. There, he wrote and produced jingles for Nabisco, Sony, Miller beers and others, in addition to I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke. This collaboration with the English song- writers Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway was later rewritten to become the 1971 New Seekers' hit, I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing. </p> <p>After retiring as senior vice-president and music director at McCann-Erickson, Davis continued his involvement with music. Shortly before his death, he completed work on an album by the Australian singer Kate Cerberano. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and son. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Roquel 'Billy' Davis, songwriter and producer, born July 11 1932; died September 3 2004</p>",
  "The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, accused extremist rabbis and settler leaders yesterday of inciting a civil war against his government's plan to withdraw all Jews from the Gaza Strip and some parts of the West Bank. <p>Mr Sharon banged the table at the weekly meeting of the cabinet as he denounced his opponents' call to soldiers to disobey orders to remove the settlers, their threats of violence against the security forces and their likening of the Gaza pullout to Nazi crimes. </p> <p>\"We have witnessed in the past few days a fierce campaign of incitement and, I would say, calls that are actually aimed at causing a civil war,\" the prime minister said. </p> <p>\"I am telling you [the settlers]: leave the army and the security forces out of this ugly game. It is unacceptable to involve the army, to incite against them and to threaten them.\" </p> <p>Despite Mr Sharon's warning, tens of thousands of settlers and their supporters, a large proportion of them teenagers, rallied in Jerusalem last night against the plan to withdraw 7,500 Jews from the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Under the banner \"Disengagement is tearing the nation apart\", some of the protesters held up pictures of the prime minister labelled \"The Dictator\". Others waved the biblical quotation: \"A time to love, a time to hate ... \" </p> <p>Last week, at a meeting of settler leaders, rabbis and the defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, opponents of the plan said it would provoke a civil war, and threatened to expel soldiers from the settlements. </p> <p>At the weekend 200 rightwingers, including the father and brother of the finance minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, published an open letter denouncing Mr Sharon's plan as \"a crime against humanity and the ethnic cleansing of Jews\". </p> <p>The letter called on Israeli soldiers to disobey orders to carry the policy out </p> <p>It said the army \"was created to defend us against enemies, not to go after Jews and expel them from their motherland. Soldiers, officers and policemen must listen to their national conscience and not participate in operations they are bound to regret for the rest of their life.\" </p> <p>Another of Mr Netanyahu's relatives equated the removal of settlers with Nazi crimes. </p> <p>Mr Sharon responded yesterday by criticising those of his ministers, such as Mr Netanyahu, who have failed to criticise such accusations. \"I expect government ministers to make their voices heard in this matter,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I call on ministers, and those in the settlements who have come out with this campaign of incitement, to stop this thing immediately.\" </p> <p>Rabbis have said on previous occasions that the Torah requires soldiers to disobey orders to remove Jews from their homes, and that Jews may kill Jews in defence of Jewish control of the land. </p> <p>Settler leaders say Mr Sharon is behaving undemocratically, because members of his Likud party rejected the Gaza plan in a referendum. </p> <p>The warning of violence has revived memories of the assassination in November 1995 of the then prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, by a rightwing extremist after a vitriolic campaign which compared him to a member of the Nazi SS. Mr Rabin's supporters accused Mr Sharon and Mr Netanyahu of stoking the hatred that led to that assassination. </p> <p>Yesterday the justice minister, Yosef Lapid, warned that a similar climate was emerging. \"I think some of the expressions we've heard lately do remind us of the expressions we heard before the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The difference is that before Rabin's assassination we didn't think it was possible. Now we know it is.\" </p> <p>Mr Lapid said that to curb the threat the authorities were prepared to invoke measures used against the Palestinians, but rarely against Israelis, such as detention without trial. </p> <p>\"For the first time in 50 years there is the threat of serious clashes between various factions of our political spectrum which threaten to be alarmingly close to a bloodbath,\" he said. We cannot tolerate incitement to violence or unlawful action ... </p> <p>\"We have the legal right to order administrative detention. We use this on very, very rare occasions because, although it is lawful, it is not a democratic instrument.\" </p> <p>Rightwing members of parliament accused Mr Sharon of being the one to provoke a civil war. \"The key to civil war is in the prime minister's hands,\" a National Union MP, Aryeh Eldad, said defiantly. </p> <p>\"If it does break out, he will be remembered in the history of the nation of Israel as the one who caused it.\" </p> <p>The cabinet is expected to vote tomorrow in support of the principles of a parliamentary bill giving legal force to the disengagement plan. </p> <p>The bill will lay out two stages of evacuation, authorising first the security forces to seal off the areas marked for withdrawal, and then the forcible removal of settlers who refuse to leave voluntarily.</p>",

  "<p>Four years ago it was hailed as the biggest single investment in public transport outside London and essential for breathing new life into run-down communities. In authorising a three-fold expansion of Greater Manchester's super-tram system - Metrolink - deputy prime minister John Prescott, then transport supremo, hailed the network as a model for the rest of Britain. </p> <p>The local passenger transport executive (PTE) spent \u00a3200m buying land while demolishing houses, blocks of flats - even schools - along the proposed routes of three new lines while it prepared to let contracts for the expansion. </p> <p>Out of the blue two months ago, transport secretary Alistair Darling pulled the plug on the system, which began operations in 1991, because he claimed costs were rising out of control. </p> <p>However, others suspect that the Department of Transport has gone cool on schemes for light rail, or trams, in a string of cities - earlier this year Nottingham became the latest to take to the streets - as it grapples with the cost of the proposed Crossrail rail link between west and east London. </p> <p>At first sight Mr Darling's decision appears to have some justification, with the cost of Metrolink's expansion rising from an original \u00a3520m to \u00a3900m. </p> <p>But transport planners claim the costs are inflated because companies which run the system under contract to the PTE now include a sizeable sum in their estimates to take account of risk. The experts say costs could be reduced considerably if the government or local taxpayers agreed to underwrite some of that risk. The Department of Transport is said to be balking at the prospect. </p> <p>Whatever the financial arguments, Mr Darling's decision, which has been privately questioned by Mr Prescott, has generated a big campaign in Greater Manchester, with slogans plastered on the sides of trams, town halls and in shopping precincts. </p> <p>As part of a Get Back on Track campaign, rallies are being held throughout the conurbation while a deputation of local MPs met Mr Darling at the weekend, apparently gaining few concessions. Tony Blair has agreed to meet another lobby group. </p> <p>\"No issue in recent times has so united people in anger and bewilderment,\" proclaimed Michael Meacher, the Oldham West and Royton MP and former environment minister, at a weekend rally in his constituency. \"All of us are going to fight to get this changed for as long as it takes.\" </p> <p>Earlier, Mr Prescott told the Guardian that expansion of the network was still a live issue. \"The trams have been a success in Manchester. They have got people out of their cars and on to public transport, and brought growth to outlying areas.\" </p> <p>The deputy prime minister is particularly uneasy because he will be hosting a conference on urban themes in Manchester in January which will attract speakers from around the world. It will include study visits around a city which Mr Prescott sees as one of the greatest regeneration successes in Britain. Metrolink was meant to symbolise that success. </p> <p>When the first Metrolink line opened in 1991, stretching 20 miles from Bury to Altrincham, with a short spur to Eccles following in 1998, the system was hailed as a pace-setter for the rest of the country. The planned new lines would link Manchester city centre with Oldham and Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester's booming airport, Britain's third largest. </p> <p>Around the country, seven systems are now operating, from the extensive Tyne and Wear Metro, which opened almost 25 years ago, to Sheffield, Croydon, Birmingham-Wolverhampton and Nottingham. Others were planned for Leeds and Liverpool, while a system for Edinburgh, Mr Darling's home city, is in the pipeline with part of the funding likely to come from the Scottish Executive, not the Department of Transport. </p> <p>Claiming the various systems were a huge success, the then transport minister John Spellar said his department was \"extremely heartened\" by their operation. But that was two years ago. At the weekend Mr Darling told the protesting MPs that the rise in Metrolink's costs was not acceptable. </p> <p>Chris Mulligan, director general of Greater Manchester PTE, said the Department of Transport was encouraging the conurbation to consider congestion charging as a way of funding extensions. </p> <p>\"That is a flip-flop in government policy because the idea is that you improve public transport to provide an alternative to the car before any changes take place,\" he said. \"We have proved this system is a great success. It makes a healthy surplus. I have never seen such a strength of feeling among our MPs.\" </p> <p>Manchester city council maintains that the government has a moral commitment to proceed with the scheme because developers have been persuaded to invest in the city on the grounds that Metrolink will serve the regenerated areas, particularly around the Commonwealth Games complex in east Manchester.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Halsey will have been tossing and turning in his sleep last night as he awaited the verdict on an erratic refereeing performance that saw him change his mind about giving a penalty to Fulham, deny Arsenal a penalty and then rule out a goal for the home side involving a push that only he saw. </p> <p>Keith Hackett, the manager of the referees' select group, said he would wait until he had analysed Halsey's conduct on Prozone, the computer package that breaks down performance levels, and had received various reports on the game before talking to the referee today. Hackett has already suspended Andy D'Urso for 28 days from the Premier League list this season for failing to send off Blackburn's Barry Ferguson after booking him twice; Halsey must be awaiting his fate with some trepidation. </p> <p>It seems likely from Hackett's comments, however, that he will escape with censure rather than a ban. The controversy arose in the 31st minute when Arsenal's Ashley Cole appeared to bring down Andy Cole in the penalty area. The referee pointed to the spot, only to change his mind after protests by the players. He then consulted his assistant and spoke to both captains before ordering a drop ball which he bounced into the Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's hands. </p> <p>Fulham's fans were furious and the weekend media were unrestrained. \"Anarchy,\" screamed the News of the World, while Gary Lineker suggested on Match Of The Day that Halsey's decision gave a licence to players to protest at decisions in the hope of the referee overturning them. </p> <p>Halsey should at least be commended for explaining his actions afterwards. \"The player reaction put a doubt in my mind. I've got to be honest, I made a mistake [in giving the penalty],\" he admitted. </p> <p>Such honesty left Hackett with a headache that he was unsure how to resolve yesterday. He has encouraged more openness among referees this season, believing that they should be seen to be as accountable as managers and players when things go wrong, but he is keen that they should only do so when explaining decisions based on the laws of the game rather than, say, intuition. </p> <p>\"I'm surprised that he came out and explained a decision that doesn't involve the law,\" Hackett said. \"What really concerns me is his comment explaining the players' reaction. These things should not influence a referee's decision. </p> <p>\"The Premier League observer will be consulting with the managers and Mark will be putting in a report and I've got to wait for the reports.\" </p> <p>Fulham's manager Chris Coleman was making no secret of what would be in his. \"He was crap. He said that he disallowed the penalty because of the reaction of my players and the Arsenal players. Did anyone see my players ask him not to give a penalty?\" </p> <p>Referees were easy targets over the weekend and, as Halsey is arguably the Premiership's best, it would be unfair to condemn him after a single off-day. In his defence, replays showed Andy Cole trying to get a shot away before Ashley Cole clattered into him, scuffing the ball towards the hands of Lehmann. </p> <p>Where Halsey did get it wrong was in the incidents that followed. In the 41st minute he was a long way behind play when Moritz Volz crunched into the back of Thierry Henry's ankle and refused to award a penalty. Then, when Collins John rose well to head the ball past Lehmann, Halsey disallowed the goal for a questionable push. </p> <p>The referee looked unnerved as stewards escorted him from the pitch but he regained his equilibrium in the second half - as did the champions whose players seemed weary after a week of international duty, particularly their returning captain Patrick Vieira. </p> <p>The introduction on the hour of Jos\u00e9 Reyes for Robert Pires did the trick, three goals in nine minutes helping Arsenal extend their unbeaten run to 45 games and put clear daylight between themselves and Chelsea at the top of the table. </p> <p>First Reyes instigated the move that allowed Freddie Ljungberg to score smartly, before the Gunners persuaded Zat Knight to toe-poke an own-goal. Reyes then scored himself after a sumptuous pass from Dennis Bergkamp. It left Arsenal looking good for tomorrow night's Champions League encounter with PSV Eindhoven. \"We have the momentum,\" said Wenger.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing to check at City was the goalkeeper's ears. But there, between the posts, was David James, former England No1. The Sun donkey Mavis had appeared at the transfer window after it closed. On this showing by James she is unlikely ever to get a look-in. </p> <p>Kevin Keegan buys keepers - eight in three years - as Imelda Marcos did shoes but he was standing by his man. His defence evidently had the same faith, frequently exposing him despite Everton's wary 4-5-1. Three times in the first half he made close-range saves, twice dropping to block and once, admittedly, retrieving his own uncertainty about a free-kick with point-blank reaction to beat out a header. This was a strong response to the croquet hoop of Vienna. </p> <p>As Keegan said: \"The performance should have earned us three points. We don't want all our ability left at Carrington [the training ground where they allegedly looked world-beaters on Friday]. We're about quick movement but we never got any of our important players doing the things they can. We needed more inventiveness, better selection.\" </p> <p>To a man, bar James, City were obstinately obtuse as asses and anonymous as a work and pensions secretary. With luck some of them have good families they could spend more passionate time with. Here, on the hour, they let Tony Hibbert cross and Tim Cahill head in unchallenged by two defenders. </p> <p>James had no chance but, if he lost his clean sheet, he kept his counsel. \"Maybe the circumstances of the goal could be looked at,\" he said in the manner of Lord Butler - mistakes were made but no one was to blame. </p> <p>The goal led to an episode as daft as the donkey and in keeping with a game that has been allowed to run off the rails of reason by its own self-importance, ill discipline and weak authority over the years. Cahill, naturally excited at his first goal since his \u00a32m summer move, celebrated with shirt over head as he did all last season with Millwall and, having already been booked, saw yellow again and red. \"I must ask the Gaffer for the rule book,\" he said. Then, perhaps, he can tell the Gaffer what it says. </p> <p>The managers were united in indignation and professed ignorance. David Moyes asked: \"Is that the rule?\" adding: \"If you think what happened was ridiculous, I think you should say so.\" Keegan, suggesting that \"some guy, probably in Switzerland, made a ruling\", said: \"The game's going mad. To end up being sent off for what Tim did is just ridiculous. I've every sympathy for him.\" </p> <p>Steve Bennett agreed, up to a point, and he was the referee: \"I have sympathy with him but laws are there to be enforced.\" Keegan too was right, up to a point. An edict on shirt removal came from Fifa in May, Circular No907, and was sent to all clubs by the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd with \"Don't Get Shirty With Me\" wall posters precisely showing Cahill's offence. It is nothing to do with the FA, whose officials are more interested in getting their trousers off. </p> <p>The incident invigorated the last half-hour, accentuating Everton's pluses and City's minuses. The one found heroes putting bodies on the line, the other remained dim and limp. Everton, shaky at the start of the match, held their shape at the end and hardly committed a foul. City, bereft of ideas, did not once test Nigel Martyn. </p> <p>Moyes said: \"We walked out of here with heads bowed in spring [after a 5-1 beating that cost \u00a32m in prize money and stuck in his throat all summer]. Today not only are our heads up but our chests out.\" Last season they won only once away. They have beaten that already. </p> <p>James's head, too, was high. Introduced by the PA as \"always our No1\", he said: \"The fans were awesome. I know I am not a bad keeper.\" He said he did not read the papers but would not wish what happened to him on anyone. What? Not even the press? He was just disappointed to have lost. As Bottom said: \"Let Thisbe have clean linen.\"</p>",
  "<p>The manner in which India scored 290 runs on a soft pitch and, despite not bowling them out, ensured Kenya finished 98 short of their target has put them in an ideal frame of mind for the match against their arch-rivals Pakistan at Edgbaston on Sunday. </p> <p>Even without their talisman Sachin Tendulkar India found inspiration enough and proved they can adapt to the needs of batting in England. The tested formula of keeping wickets in hand for a frenetic late slog is easier said than done for a top order stacked with stroke-players but they got it right on Saturday. </p> <p>While India's bowling has made rapid strides in the last few years, it is still the batting that generally wins them matches. Rahul Dravid put his finger on it: \"The ball swung and seamed a bit and we had to lay a proper foundation so we could accelerate in the end. It took us time to get used to the conditions, but we built a big partnership and that set the base.\" </p> <p>India have now won their last two matches on this visit to England and have built up a healthy head of steam, but the fact they have lost their previous two against Pakistan will inevitably be at the back of their minds. In previous years when India have turned in limp performances in the World Cup, their fans could always be pacified by a win against Pakistan. </p> <p>But now Sourav Ganguly claims to be captaining the second best team in the world, and the very least India need to do to justify such a status is a Champions Trophy semi-final berth. </p> <p>So, with the Indian batting machine seemingly having found its timing, the off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has just recovered from a career-threatening finger injury, could be the difference when they meet Pakistan. </p> <p>\"He's bowling brilliantly. The way he's bowling now reminds me of the Harbhajan of old, when he was at his best,\" said Dravid. \"When he's bowling like that he's a matchwinner.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jagmohan Dalmiya is set to become Indian cricket's first patron-in-chief, a post that could enable him to retain control over the cash-rich Board of Control for Cricket in India even after his term as president ends later this month.</p>",
  "<p>From the moment in November 2000 when he picked up a spare ride in the Melbourne Cup which turned out to be the winner, Kerrin McEvoy has shown an uncanny knack for finding his way on to the right horse at the right time, a habit which has clearly followed him to the other side of the world. </p> <p>Had Frankie Dettori not been required to ride for Godolphin in Ireland, the organisation's No1 jockey would have taken the ride on Rule Of Law in Saturday's St Leger at Doncaster. In his absence McEvoy, Dettori's deputy, took the reins on the 3-1 joint-favourite. </p> <p>Yet good fortune - and an overloaded programme - can take you only so far. When the stalls opened, it was McEvoy's assurance in the saddle that carried him to his first victory in an English Classic. </p> <p>There were concerns over Rule Of Law's ability to last the 14-furlong trip, so it was a confident move by McEvoy to quickly grab the lead, not least since he knew that a strong headwind was waiting for them in the home straight. </p> <p>What McEvoy had done, though, was to seize the initiative, and his grip did not relax until the line. He set a moderate pace that only quickened slightly half a mile out, and did not wind up to full-throttle until the two-pole. Now his own mount's speed proved crucial and he had just enough in reserve to hold the challenges of Quiff and Tycoon. </p> <p>\"He's given him an absolutely fabulous ride,\" one observer said. \"The way he has adapted to our racing has been fantastic.\" That the spectator was Dettori, who watched the race at Leopardstown, can only have added to McEvoy's delight.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Yahoo!, as part of its redoubled efforts in the battle of the search engines, has been bombarding Diary with tat for most of the past week.

We should perhaps point out that inflation has left 1,000,000 lira worth less than the paper it's printed on.

  "<p>I say, what a to-do at the Daily Telegraph. Last Monday's sports section was something of an eye-opener, to say the least. Six pairs of naked breasts were on display in a picture spread which must have had some male readers checking their pacemakers. </p> <p>That was a relatively minor shock though. For a closer professional look revealed that the two pages, showing pictures of 10 streakers at sports events, were not what they seemed: they were a none-too-subtle merging of advertising and editorial. </p> <p>The entire two-page display was, in fact, part of a five-week, six-figure deal between the advertiser, Clinique, and a wing of the Telegraph's advertising department, the commercial development division. Media Week has described it as an \"advertorial\". Yet the average reader would hardly have realised. </p> <p>The strapline at the top tagged the pages as \"sportextra\", using the same typeface as appeared in the rest of the section, but did not make clear that they had been produced at the behest of the advertiser, whose advert ran across the foot of the two pages. The \"cod\" editorial copy, which was not bylined, did not state that the feature was part of a commercial enterprise. </p> <p>It is true that the sans headline typeface and text were not typical of the paper's usual editorial format, but that was the only possible clue - apart from the un-Telegraph-like content - that the spread was not editorially driven. </p> <p>An internal inquest was instituted at Canary Wharf last week because several journalists, including those at the highest level, were upset by the blurring of the lines between editorial and advertising. As one senior executive explained: \"We are concerned about whether this kind of 'advertorial' could destroy the integrity of our paper. We certainly need to define where the boundaries between editorial and advertising lie\". </p> <p>The Telegraph incident should not be seen in isolation. It represents the growing problems all newspapers are facing as they strive to win advertising revenue against a background of falling circulation and falling profits. </p> <p>Advertisers are conscious of the climate of concern among the national titles, which have together created the Newspaper Marketing Agency (NMA) specifically because of the need to attract more adverts. The ad agencies are therefore flexing their muscles, fighting aggressively for deals that impinge on editorial terrain previously considered off-limits. </p> <p>The agency that negotiated the deal for Clinique, M2M, is cock-a-hoop about its coup. The NMA's chief executive, Maureen Duffy, is particularly delighted that her campaign to attract advertisers to sports pages appears to be paying dividends, happily pointing out that the Clinique ads may have been the result of the NMA presentation to its ultimate owner, the Est\u00e9e Lauder group. James Mann, the Telegraph Group's head of sports sponsorship, is reportedly delighted too. </p> <p>But journalists can not be other than alarmed at what is happening. In recent years it has become obvious that ad agencies and their clients have moved way beyond the idea of paying only for display ads, believing that acting as sponsors for editorial material pays greater dividends. Brands like to be associated with newspapers for the obvious reason that it lends credibility to their products. </p> <p>But the catch is that the credibility exists because the editorial content of papers is viewed by readers as commercially neutral. If that sense of impartiality is lost, then the benefit to the advertiser is destroyed along with the newspaper itself, a classic case of a parasite killing off its host. </p> <p>Commercial links need not compromise a paper as long as they are stated unequivocally. For example, in Friday's Independent a page, set within the business section, was clearly tagged \"Commercial feature in association with HSBC Bank plc\". </p> <p>Similarly this year's Media 100 was \"supported by Audi\". All papers have guidelines which are supposed to ensure that copy linked with an advertiser is properly labelled. But, with papers chasing revenue and advertisers waving cheques, holding the line is becoming more difficult because advertisers see great advantages in disguising that they are paying for editorial space. </p> <p>Another grey area was illustrated in last week's Times, which, as it has done for several years, published a full page about a pro-am golf tournament, the Lombard trophy. Apart from the coverage of the match there was \"puff\" material about the Portuguese course and the trophy's joint sponsors, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Professional Golfers' Association, alongside a display advertisement for the bank. </p> <p>It was compiled and organised by its \"special reports\" division, although the label at the top of the page read simply \"Lombard Trophy\". This is the way the Times labels its special reports, but readers might get the impression that the articles had no commercial tie-up. All newspapers, including the Guardian, face this headache continually and sometimes, from a journalistic point of view, get it wrong. </p> <p>Of course, none of this is very new as far as advertisers are concerned. They have been doing similar deals with glossy magazines for years, often clouding the distinction between editorial and advertising so successfully that what passes for journalism is largely seen as a branch of commercialism. </p> <p>Regardless of the pressures to raise revenue, editors and senior journalists must head off the insistence of advertisers to encroach on their editorial territory or they will undermine their own integrity and, in the long term, sound the death knell for newspapers. </p> <p>If that sounds unduly cataclysmic, consider again the Telegraph's acceptance of the Clinique feature about streakers. If someone in editorial had suggested that idea it would have been dismissed as a bad joke. Yet here was a feature with gratuitous nudity which concluded that streaking \"is just a bit of fun\" which \"no one minds\". No one, that is, except every sporting authority. To see the Daily Telegraph encouraging people to streak was simply unbelievable. </p> <p><strong>Why text on TV still appeals</strong></p> <p>In these days of instantaneous online news, the once-revolutionary television text services seem rather quaint. But they remain unusually popular as a prime source of news for millions of viewers, amounting to some 40% of the population. </p> <p>So Ceefax, which celebrates its 30th birthday in 10 days' time, remains a key part of the BBC's empire. It was on September 23, 1974 that Ceefax went live, becoming the world's first teletext system. </p> <p>It was, like so many groundbreaking inventions, the result of an accident. BBC engineers who were exploring a way of providing subtitles for the deaf discovered that a normal TV picture of 625 lines had spare capacity, which could be used to transmit words or numbers. After an experiment with Teledata, as it was originally called, came Ceefax, followed within less than a year by ITV's Oracle service. </p> <p>There were only 30 pages at the time, and its editor, Colin McIntyre, worked alone initially, feeding punch tape into machines. \"It was very fast,\" he recalls. \"I was literally typing on air.\" </p> <p>The audience takeup rate was slow for the first seven years, because of the expense of decoders, but soon the service expanded year by year. McIntyre was running a newsroom of 20 people by the time he retired in 1982. Ceefax now contains more than 2,000 pages, and benefits from regionalised pages as well. </p> <p>\"It is a much-loved and well-used service\", says Pete Clifton, editor of BBC News Interactive. \"We get thousands of letters, terrific feedback\". He concedes that people complain about the service's frustrating slowness though it doesn't appear to stop them viewing, with its four most popular areas - TV listings, sport, weather and news headlines - getting the bulk of the traffic. </p> <p>Surely, though, when the analogue system is turned off, Ceefax-style text news will vanish? Not so, says Clifton, pointing to the latest development in his newsroom, which was transformed three months ago to unify the interactive news staff, linking Online and Ceefax. Now subeditors must provide the same tightly written news story for both analogue and digital TV transmissions, and for the online and mobile phone services. </p> <p>Why, in this computer age, do people go on viewing? The answer, of course, is that the TV screen remains of paramount importance in many homes and accessing by remote control is easy. \"My theory\", says McIntyre, \"is that Ceefax provides tremendous reassurance - people can quickly look in to see that there hasn't been a disaster!\"</p> <p><strong>A case for the PCC?</strong></p> <p>\"I have to say\", said a tabloid editor in an off-the-record briefing last week, \"I do feel a teensy bit upset for Gwyneth. She is trying to live life as normal mum, and she can hardly do that with photographers around her all the time\". </p> <p>But Gwyneth Paltrow needs more than sympathy in facing up to the paparazzi. The stalkers with cameras who stake out her house, follow her to the park where she takes her daughter and tail her car are guilty of breaking the clause in the editors' code of practice which outlaws harassment. </p> <p>So why do editors encourage them by buying their sneaky pictures? Perhaps Sir Christopher Meyer, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, would like to ask them. </p> <p><strong>National newspaper circulation</strong></p> <p>Summer is rarely a great period for newspaper sales, but some titles did manage in August to improve a little on their previous month's returns. More obvious were the declining year-on-year comparisons: it has never been more difficult to sell papers. </p> <p>Even editors who can point to bucking the trend would have to acknowledge that giveaway CDs played a greater part in attracting readers than their editorial innovations. Nor did Britain's Olympic successes make a difference because television obviously scooped the medals. </p> <p>Among the serious titles, the Guardian's continuing poor figures stand out, especially when contrasted with the compact Independent and the Times, which is so pleased with its compact version it is restricting circulation of the broadsheet issues still further. </p> <p>At least the Guardian has a definite plan to introduce a new format, and must do all it can to grip on during its most worrying sales reverse since the 1986 launch of the Independent. Doubtless, the Daily Telegraph's new owners are also thinking deeply about what to do as they face up to the reality of poor sales figures and, given that only 495,000 were sold at full rate last month, falling circulation revenue. Do the Barclays really believe they have a healthy long-term future with the broadsheet shape? </p> <p>For the old-fashioned tabloids, especially the red-tops, the situation looks particularly bleak. With the Daily Star inching towards the million mark, the Daily Mirror and the Sun cannot seem to please their readers. Is it because they have lost their credibility? If so, why should the less credible Star be doing so well? </p> <p>The other interesting phenomenon is the becalmed Daily Mail which has reached 2.4m and just cannot seem to go higher.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Source: ABC</p>",
  "<p>Martin's desk had been a mess for weeks. Years, really. Not just the desk, but the floor beneath it, which resembled a cardboard city. One day, he invested in matching folders, pen pot and paperclips in bright green. He threw out three binbags of stuff. Suddenly there was a transformation. \"How long will it last, do you think?\" Kerry asked him in an interested voice. \"For ever! I've had therapy!\" Martin was evangelistic. He'd bought a \"simplify your life\" tape which he'd listened to every morning, telling him that if he tidied up his desk, his life also would become tidier, more productive.</p> <p>I listened to the tape as well. I'd love to be tidier. \"Imagine your life, let's say, six weeks from now, when everything is in its place and there's a place for everything. You can find everything on your desk, instantly. How will your life look? How good will it feel?\" drones the hypnotic voice of the therapist. The next day I bought a box of coloured paperclips.</p> <p>According to a new survey by office products manufacturer Avery, 55% of people can't remember the last time they saw their desk. Yet 82% of those questioned said that \"keeping my desk tidy would make me work more efficiently\". Solutions? They're are all in your storage. Stewart Murdoch, marketing director of Avery, insists, \"The wastebasket is the best filing storage.\" He never prints off anything, tidies his desk at the end of every day and advises, \"Whittle that pile on your desk down to nothing every single week.\"</p> <p>Sally, a senior marketing PA in Manchester, moans, \"I don't think working by email has removed the paper aspect of an office at all. In fact it's increased it, because most people still print all their emails out. With our tiny, crammed offices, paper mounts up. We are surrounded by piles of it. I worked in pre-computer days and offices were far neater.\"</p> <p>Some people work well in complete chaos. Adam Walker, author of Success Is Not Enough (Piatkus, \u00a39.99) and a leading authority on \"personal effectiveness\" (his description) says, \"My secretary works surrounded by confusion. Yet she hasn't lost anything in 11 years and is incredibly efficient. So tidiness and efficiency don't necessarily go hand in hand.\"</p> <p>\"The most decisive way to simplify your office life is to put a suspension file on the floor next to your desk - keep all floor areas clear. Then you always have a clear desk, plus a clear floor apart from the suspension file. Conquer those paper piles once and for all,\" lectures the German author Tiki Kustenmacher (How to Simplify Your Life - Seven Practical Steps McGraw Hill, \u00a38.99).</p> <p>Stacks have a depressing effect on your desk - make sure they never form in the first place.</p> <p>When you rearrange stacks into that suspension file, you create order. If you have a job to do, enter it in your diary as well. Your suspension file at your feet soon becomes the central tool and your \"control station\" - while keeping your desk pristine.</p> <p>Anything you absolutely must keep on your desk, slip into a transparent folder. Don't have any loose bits of paper. Everything must be in these transparent pockets, labelled, preferably by bright colored pen with different colours for different things.</p> <p><strong>Storage solvers</strong> <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Invent clever names for folders - not \"must\" or \"to do\".<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Keep clearing out your suspension file and freshening it up.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> On the front of the folders, write essential phone numbers and emails.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> When you put something in the file, throw something away as well.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Break the tidying task into chunks - one desk drawer a day perhaps.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Make storage \"families\" of items using bright colours.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Rearrange desk items regularly.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Impose a deadline. See how much you can tidy in 20 minutes.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Clear everything from your desktop, dust and polish it now and then.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Can you barter the task with a super-neat colleague?

  "<p>If you think the newspapers are already packed with stories of people taking their employers to court, you may be in for a shock in the future. Figures show that the number of applications to employment tribunals has risen by 17% during the last year alone and James Davies, employment partner with City solicitors Lewis Silkin, believes these numbers are nothing compared to what they will be. </p> <p>\"People are increasingly aware of their rights,\" he says. \"One of my clients is Merrill Lynch banker Stephanie Villalba, who is claiming sex discrimination against the investment bank. The truth is that the case isn't that different from other claims, but for some reason it's attracting a lot of press interest. Some readers will inevitably read about it or remember it in the future and think, 'That's happened to me. I could do something about it.'\" </p> <p>Adding to people's temptation to take their dispute as far as an employment tribunal is exaggerated expectation, believes Mike Emmott, employee relations adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). \"The cases hitting the headlines are usually the ones with huge pay-outs,\" he explains. \"But in fact, the vast majority of cases found in favour of the claimant produce a few thousand pounds at the most and even those sums can be trimmed if the outcome isn't 100% in their favour.\" </p> <p>Even if it hadn't crossed your mind to take a case against your employer, the thought is increasingly likely to be put there by someone else - a specialist lawyer, for example. Indeed, a growing number are becoming more proactive in pushing people to claim for compensation - another reason for the number of applications to employment tribunals having risen, the majority of which are cases for unfair dismissal and deduction of wages. </p> <p>Neema Choudry, a partner at the law firm Eversheds, adds that a growing number of claims are \"multiple\", which is also responsible for the increase in figures. \"I'm seeing more and more people refusing to put all their eggs in one basket. So instead of just taking out an unfair dismissal claim, they'll also go for breach of contract and discrimination. This has two aims: first, it maximises their settlement and second, it puts pressure on the defendant, who may therefore be more willing to offer a settlement rather than dealing with the cost of defending three separate claims.\" </p> <p>The increase in legislation protecting employees is also significant, she believes. \"Last Christmas, for example, we had the right for the first time to bring discrimination claims on the grounds of sexual orientation and religious belief,\" she says. Figures show that 52 cases have already been brought as a result. </p> <p>A growth in the number of workers claiming disability discrimination is also expected in the future. After all, the government has changed the draft disability discrimination bill to include a wider definition of mental illness. \"In 2006, age discrimination comes in,\" adds Choudry. </p> <p>For the first time, every single person will be covered by a piece of discrimination legislation, points out Jonathan Maude, head of the employment group at Manches in London. \"The age discrimination law won't just affect older people,\" he explains. \"If you are young and feel you haven't got a job because you don't look experienced enough, for example, you may have a case. It really will affect people of all ages.\" </p> <p>Although nobody appears to welcome the UK's growing litigation culture (with the obvious exception of lawyers), the Work Foundation is particularly cynical. David Coates, associate director of policy, explains why he believes the solution is a return to greater union presence. </p> <p>\"Fifteen or 20 years ago, it was far more likely that disputes would have been resolved in the workplace by the employee's union. But with the decline of unions and collective bargaining, there has been an increase in tribunal applications. I think this situation leaves the Government and employers with a clear choice - more litigation or more negotiation.\" The TUC is none too pleased about the increase in claims either. \"The rise in applications to tribunals shows that employers are still failing to respect their employees and the law,\" says a spokesperson. </p> <p>But others are pessimistic for different reasons. \"The more people that make claims, the more we move into a 'cry wolf' culture,\" Jonathan Maude believes. \"There are clearly many genuine applications out there, but there are now many non-genuine ones too. I'd say that six or seven cases out of 10 discrimination claims have no merit whatsoever. People open the papers and they see significant awards being made, with no limits. They get a jaundiced view about it all and decide that spending half a day filling out an application to win thousands of pounds isn't a bad way to pass their time. </p> <p>\"Their thought process is, 'How can I make my story fit into a tribunal claim?' rather than, 'I have been wronged and I want to use the tribunal process to do something about it.'\" In fact, one recent survey found that almost nine out of 10 people would be prepared to lie if it meant winning a tribunal pay-out. Maude isn't surprised. \"I think the fact that tribunals have striven to be informal hasn't helped because it doesn't have the same aura as giving evidence in, say a criminal court. That's why people might find it easier to lie in an employment tribunal compared to other forums.\" </p> <p>So do the cases with little or no merit ever win? Maude is confident that the vast majority don't. If employers want to avoid publicity or they accept they may lose the case, they usually offer a settlement figure, he explains. But if they feel there's a good chance they'll win, they may not even try to prevent it continuing to a full hearing - which is perhaps one reason that most cases that do continue to this final stage favour the employer. </p> <p>Karen Seward, partner at the employment practice of Allen and Overy, agrees that non-genuine cases lose. \"Most people haven't got the stomach for a fight, even when they believe they do have a strong case against their employer,\" she says. </p> <p>This is confirmed by the fact that a staggering three-quarters of employment tribunal applications fail to reach a full hearing. Rita Donaghy, chair of Acas, explains, \"We have a statutory obligation to intervene in every single application to see if the parties are willing to either withdraw or settle. You can imagine that people are often emotional and angry when they start out and say they don't care about the money, that they just want to show the employer up to be rotten. The Acas conciliator provides a settling down period and a lot of people decide not to proceed at this stage or alternatively, the employer offers a token which the employee accepts.\" </p> <p>For those who do feel genuinely wronged by their employer and really aren't in it for the money, it is clearly a huge risk to carry on at this stage, as Annie Kitchen found out last month (August). A tribunal ruled that jokes about female colleagues' breasts and what underwear they wore did not amount to discrimination. Kitchen, who worked at the Express and Echo newspaper in Exeter, brought a claim for sexual harassment against her boss after he made the comments and called part of the office the \"blonde corner\". The tribunal found there was no evidence the remarks were aimed at Kitchen. </p> <p>For others, however, the risk is well worth it. Consider the transsexual who earlier this year won a six-year court battle against a chief constable who would not let her join his police force because of her sex change. Not only was the ruling positive for her personally, but it also made it easier for other transsexuals to join the police.</p>"
