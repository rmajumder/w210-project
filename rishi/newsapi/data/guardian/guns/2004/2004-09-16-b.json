  "President George Bush was warned in July that Iraq could descend into all-out civil war, according to a classified estimate which summarised the views of a number of US intelligence agencies. <p>Even the best-case scenario for Iraq is a political, economic and security situation described as tenuous. </p> <p>The National Intelligence Estimate predicts three possible scenarios: tenuous stability, political fragmentation, or civil war. </p> <p>The 50-page document, prepared in July before the latest upsurge in violence brought a sharp increase in Iraqi civilians killed and attacks on American troops, has yet to be officially released. </p> <p>A spokesman for the national security council, Scott McCormack, confirmed its existence and remained upbeat, but refused to discuss the details. </p> <p>\"In the past, including before the war to liberate Iraq, there were many different scenarios that were possible, including the outbreak of civil war. It hasn't happened,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The Iraqi people continue to defy the predictions of pundits and others.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, even Republican senators described the administration's reconstruction efforts as \"beyond pitiful\" and \"exasperating from any vantage point,\" when the White House sought to divert $3bn from reconstruction to security. </p> <p>The administration dismissed the criticism, the White House spokesman Scott McClellan calling critics \"pessimists and hand-wringers\". </p> <p>The estimate was commissioned by the outgoing CIA director, George Tenet, who told Mr Bush that the intelligence case for Iraq's ownership of weapons of mass destruction was a \"slam dunk\". </p> <p>That prediction, alongside the one that the Iraqi people would greet the US and British soldiers like liberators, failed to materialise, leaving many in Mr Bush's national security team gloomy. </p> <p>\"There doesn't seem to be much optimism,\" an official told Reuters. </p> <p>\"There is a significant amount of pessimism,\" an officer told the New York Times. </p> <p>Despite stiff criticism from those Republican and Democratic senators who believed the situation might be spiralling out of control, the administration brushed off the bleak conclusions about Iraq's immediate future. </p> <p>\"You know every step of the way in Iraq there have been pessimists and hand-wringers who said it can't be done,\" Mr McClellan said. </p> <p>\"And every step of the way the Iraqi leadership and the Iraqi people have proven them wrong because they are determined to have a free and peaceful future.\" </p> <p>More than 1,000 US soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far, and between 12,700 and 14,800 Iraqi civilians, according to the website Iraqbodycount.org, which keeps a tally based on at least two approved news sources. </p> <p>The Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry, seized on the leaks, saying that it was unlikely that Iraq would be ready to hold elections by January. </p> <p>\"I think it is very difficult to see today how you're going to distribute ballots in places like Falluja and Ramadi and Najaf and other parts of the country, without having established the security,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm not sure the president is being honest with the American people about that situation either, at this point.\" </p> <p>At a hearing to discuss the White House's requests to divert more than $3bn (about \u00a31.6bn) from aid to security, senators of both main parties lambasted the lack of progress on the ground. </p> <p>So far less than $1bn of the $18.4bn allocated has been spent. </p> <p>The Republican chairman of the foreign relations committee, Senator Richard Lugar, said the situation in Iraq was \"exasperating for anybody to look at from any vantage point\". </p> <p>Referring to the lack of overall spending on aid, Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, said: \"It's beyond pitiful, it's beyond embarrassing. It is now in the zone of dangerous.\" </p> <p>But the most excoriating attack came from the Democrat Senator Joseph Biden. </p> <p>\"The president has frequently described Iraq as 'the central front of the war on terror',\" he said. \"Well by that definition, success in Iraq is a key standard by which to measure the war on terror. And by that measure, I think the war on terror is in trouble.\" </p> <p><b> Jonathan Steele, page 28 Leader comment, page 29</b><br></p>",
  "<p>Anglo-Dutch steel producer Corus yesterday reported its first profit since it was formed by the merger of British Steel and Hoogovens almost five years ago. </p> <p>Philippe Varin, the chief executive, acknowledged however that the group still had further improvements to make if it is to match its European rivals. </p> <p>In the first half of the year Corus turned an operating loss of \u00a357m into a profit of \u00a3147m, with the recovery driven by an equal combination of soaring world steel prices and its own internal recovery programme. </p> <p>The news helped the shares climb 2.5p to 52p - despite a private placement of some 100m Corus shares - the equivalent of some 2.25% of the company. </p> <p>Corus said it did not know who had sold the shares or whether they had gone to a single buyer. City sources said, however, they believed the stake had been sold to a number of buyers. </p> <p>Commenting on the first-half performance, Mr Varin said the results showed a substantial improvement and that the group expected margins and operating profits to continue to improve in the second half. </p> <p>But he added: \"We have to keep our feet on the ground, we still have a long way to go. </p> <p>\"We have to lay the foundations for the future growth of the company.\" </p> <p>The group has already been helped by surging global steel demand - led by China and the United States - which has transformed an industry used to growth of 2-3% a year into one that saw demand climb 6% in 2002, 7% last year and an estimated 7-9% this year. </p> <p>Although the surge in demand has sent iron ore and coal pricing spiralling higher, Corus has been able to more than offset the increases through higher steel prices. </p> <p>So far it has pushed up prices by up to 50% this year through a series of increases and is likely to see margins improve even further next year, when it renegotiates contracts covering about 40% of its order book. </p> <p>As well as the improvement in the steel industry's economic fundamentals, Corus is pressing on with its \"restoring success\" programme - which is designed to deliver \u00a3680m of benefits for the group by the end of 2006. </p> <p>As part of the Corus restructuring programme the company is still planning to sell its aluminium business, having overcome opposition from the Dutch trade unions, although it acknowledged yesterday the disposal was unlikely to take place this year. </p> <p>Corus is also negotiating the sale of a controlling stake of its Teesside plant, which produces steel slab, and said yesterday it was in talks with a number of interested parties. </p> <p>They are thought to include the Swiss steel trading group Duferlo and CSN, a Brazilian company, although Corus declined to give details. </p> <p>If a deal does go through, however, Corus is expected to retain a stake of about 25% in order to retain a degree of control over output from the Teesside plant. </p> <p>Yesterday's results were better than the City had been expecting, with analysts looking for earnings from the company - before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - of between \u00a3700m and \u00a3800m for the full year. </p> <p>The steel union, Community, said the results showed the need to expand steel production in the UK, rather than cut it back. </p> <p>\"Should Corus re-evaluate its strategy and take further advantage of the changed market conditions, this really could be a new dawn for the company.\"</p>",
  "Johnny Ramone, the guitarist with the eponymous punk group The Ramones, died at his home in Los Angeles on Wednesday following a five-year battle with prostate cancer. He was 55. <p>The quartet, which formed in New York in 1974, became hugely influential, although never had any hits. </p> <p>The band's songs, including Sheena Was a Punk Rocker, I Wanna be Sedated, Teenage Lobotomy and I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, gave an early voice to the boredom of a generation that found expression in the British punk scene of the late 1970s. </p> <p>\"We couldn't write about love or cars, so we sang about this stuff, like glue-sniffing. We thought it was funny. We thought we could get away with anything,\" Johnny Ramone once said. </p> <p>The band retired in 1996 following a farewell tour. Joey Ramone, the singer, died of lymphatic cancer in 2001 and Dee Dee Ramone, the bassist, died from a drug overdose in 2002. The drummer, Tommy Ramone, is the only surviving member of the original band.</p> <p>In a message posted yesterday on the band's website, Johnny Ramone's widow, Linda Cummings, wrote: \"We had tried everything but the cancer had spread all over his body. He died at peace in his sleep...</p> <p>\"As God is my witness, I am sure that the boys are together in the afterlife, for they were brothers in the true sense of the word.\" </p> <p>Like the other members of the band, Johnny Ramone had a middle-class background. He was born Johnny Cummings on Long Island, and grew up in Queens, New York. He attended military academy, and started playing guitar at 22, having worked as a builder. Ramone was reputedly an alias used by Paul McCartney. </p> <p>Johnny Ramone's political views set him aside from many of his peers. He was an outspoken Republican, whose favourite president was Ronald Reagan, and a supporter of the National Rifle Association. </p> <p>When the band was indicted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 Johnny proclaimed: \"God bless President Bush and God bless America\".</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who says they wouldn't love to be a pop star for a couple of days is lying. Everything about the job appeals on the basest level: the adulation, the parties, the entourages (a dedicated shoe-buckler, as employed by Jennifer Lopez, would be nice). Debased though pop stardom has been by programmes such as Pop Idol, it's still on every kid's wish list. </p> <p>Not to mention that of many adults. So, on a Tuesday night, I find myself jiggling along in assertively pink stilettos, the temporary new member of Britain's current biggest female pop band, Girls Aloud. Only two of my bandmates are here at this awards ceremony in London's Covent Garden - Cheryl Tweedy (tiny, Geordie, puffing a Marlboro Light) and Nicola Roberts (reserved, Scouse, big watchful eyes) - but that's enough to start with. The idea is to spend a few days with them, doing whatever it is the girl winners of the 2002 programme Popstars: The Rivals do. For one week only, I will be the sixth member of Girls Aloud. Will my new colleagues turn out to be post-Spice power-dames, or, as music journalist Paul Morley has claimed, \"tense, fearful ... victims of humiliation\"? </p> <p>I am muscling in as they promote Love Machine, the first single from their second album, What Will the Neighbours Say? The other three Girls, Kimberley Walsh, Nadine Coyle and Sarah Harding, have plumped for an early night in the apartment complex they share on the outskirts of north London. Cheryl and Nicola, though, are incuriously surveying the new recruit, who, confronted by their twinkly prettiness, feels invigoratingly old and fat. </p> <p>\"Aren't you drinking? Do you want some of this?\" Cheryl inquiringly offers her glass. What's immediately evident is that, attractive as they are, these are girls-next-door-made-good rather than bred-in-the-bone stars. Despite having trained for showbiz careers almost since they could talk, they have no aura to distinguish them from other women in the room. Great for me, because I blend in better, but perhaps a letdown for fans expecting stardust. </p> <p>Eighteen months after beating around 20,000 other hopefuls for a prize that included a five-album record deal and management by Westlife's creator Louis Walsh, they have adapted to their new lives. To everyone's surprise, they've proved more durable than most reality \"stars\". This includes the male winners of Pop Rivals, One True Voice, who split up after two unsuccessful singles. By contrast, the Girls, aged 19-22, have clocked up five likable top 10 singles and a number two debut album, Sound of the Underground, which puts them pretty much at the top of the pop game right now. </p> <p>The impertinent 1960s flavour of their material has won praise from the likes of the NME, which deems them kitsch enough to be cool. Yet their rock'n'roll credibility was boosted in an unfortunate way last year when Cheryl Tweedy was convicted of assaulting a nightclub lavatory attendant, for which she was fined \u00a33,500 plus 120 hours of community service. (The official line on the subject: \"I'm hoping I can leave it behind me and take the lessons I need to learn from it.\") </p> <p>Tonight they're casual in jeans, little T-shirts (Open 24 Hours, reads Tweedy's) and high-heeled boots. Heels, it emerges, are de rigueur for every occasion, along with dinky handbags. This is the Girls Aloud autumn look, as tweaked by stylist Kenny Ho: accessible and easily copied by kids on pocket-money budgets. We're at the Single of the Year Awards, a tongue-in-cheek event staged by the website <a href=\"http://www.PopJustice.com\">PopJustice.com</a> and held in a tapas bar. Girls Aloud's last hit, The Show, is one of 10 candidates for the \u00a320 prize, and although none of the other nominees is here, Tweedy and Roberts have turned up to thank the website for its support. \"We'd have only stayed in and watched TV otherwise,\" says Roberts. </p> <p>As soon as we plant ourselves in a corner, a trickle of men make their way over to us. Most want photos or autographs, and the girls cheerfully oblige. Despite my obvious presence, smack between the two of them, nobody asks for my autograph. Outrageous. Don't they know I'm with the band? </p> <p>We stand in our corner for an hour or so, meeting our public. Despite the heat and noise, Tweedy and Roberts seem to be having a whale of a time. I just want to get my shoes off. Mercifully, we leave before the winner - Rachel Stevens's Some Girls - is announced. \"Do you fancy getting some dinner?\" I ask. Roberts says they've eaten - and they probably have. Over the next few days I'll see them wolf down food that would be the stuff of Victoria Beckham's nightmares. </p> <p>Outside the tapas bar, I'm hoping there will be paparazzi - something I've been looking forward to all night. But no, not a one. Apparently, they're all off covering the Mercury prize, which is also on tonight. As she climbs into our people-carrier, Nicola explains a few photographers' tricks, such as shooting from below to get a view of their knickers. Frankly, I can't wait. </p> <p>The whole of the next day is given over to shooting the cover of the new album in a north London studio. It's all hands on deck: a photographer, two assistants, Kenny Ho, a press officer and three hair-and-makeup people. A rail is crammed with miniskirts, dangly tops and other examples of \"funky clubwear\". There is also a vast trove of shoes, all tall and spiky. I'm too late for lunch, but empty pizza express boxes suggest it was generous. We spend an hour being transformed from cute kittens into sultry Siamese cats, a sort of suburban-sexpot look. The new album plays in the background, sounding like a baby-punk version of Blondie's Parallel Lines. Produced by Girls Aloud's main songwriter, Brian Higgins - \"a genius\", as the girls unfailingly refer to him - it's fresh enough to warrant respect. For the first time, each girl has written a track. \"A lot of people think we don't have credibility because we didn't write our own songs on the first album,\" Tweedy says darkly. </p> <p>As Nadine Coyle shimmies over to help me dress like a Girl, she's singing: \"Deadlines and diets and devious men.\" (This song, Cheryl tells me later, is about one-night stands: \"People have one-night stands and if people don't like [the song], tough shit.\") Coyle, laid-back and born in Derry, is the odd one out in a band of ambitious northerners (tall, blonde Harding is from Stockport; smiley Walsh, who did two years of an English degree at Leeds University, is from Bradford). \"I'm not as driven as the others,\" says Coyle, \"just as long as I get some satisfaction from it. Out of all of us, I've done the least stuff before, 'cos I didn't go to stage school.\" </p> <p>We establish that I can't fit into any of the shoes - only an elf could - and I'm not deluded enough even to touch the size-eight skirts. But the hairdresser and makeup artist accomplish a miracle, and with my glossed-up hair and zazzed-up eyes, I'm ready for the photo shoot. </p> <p>There's a great deal of waiting around in the studio. Waiting as everybody else \"readies\" things appears to be the band's main occupation. During one interlude, Tweedy wanders over. One of five siblings from a Newcastle council estate, she is the band's rags-to-semi-riches story. \"I hate when you hear bands moaning - get a grip and be fucking grateful,\" she says passionately. \"I came from nothing. We lived on benefits. I could've been fucked up on drugs, but I learned from my elder brother and sister's mistakes.\" She quickly discovered the other side of the glittery Girls Aloud coin when an ex-boyfriend sold his story to a tabloid. \"I was so upset and so hurt, because he treated me like shit the whole time I was seeing him, and then this ... I rang him and said, 'I want an explanation, because all I ever did was help and support you.' He started crying and said they'd been hounding him for 10 months.\" </p> <p>Posing for pictures is rather hard work, and takes ages, because of the difficulty of getting all of us in sync. Later, Harding estimates that they've done around 100 photo sessions. \"Boy bands have it so much easier because they're so quick to get ready. They don't spend hours in hair and makeup.\" It's 8pm by the time we're done, and it's surprising how tiring it is to do not very much for several hours. </p> <p>The next day is more to my taste, involving as it does television and lust-sodden fans. We're off to MTV to appear on the show TRL, and a small crowd is outside to greet us. We have to scamper past as hands grab for us. For them, rather. Inexplicably, I'm not allowed to be on the actual programme. Instead, I wait with another guest, ex-Westlifer Bryan McFadden. In keeping with the theme of the single Love Machine, TRL's host presents the group with sex toys and invites them to guess what they do. \"This one's called OctoPussy,\" he says encouragingly. </p> <p>Girls Aloud leave the MTV building to a mini-riot as fans and a couple of nonplussed Leicester Square booze-hounds demand autographs. This should be my moment - but, tragically, it's not. I get separated from the band and by the time I find the exit, the group are disappearing into their car. As they rumble off, three young boys approach. My public! Alas, it's not me they want. One of them boldly brandishes his phone, which contains a picture of Harding, and asks: \"Can you give me Sarah's mobile number?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The single Love Machine is out this week. What Will the Neighbours Say? is out on November 29.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1</strong> Leonard Cohen has been labelled \"the poet laureate of pessimism\", \"the grocer of despair\", \"the godfather of gloom\" and \"the prince of bummers\". He has, none the less, given pleasure and even laughter to the million or so people who buy his records.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> He will be 70 on Tuesday, the first of the 1960s singer-songwriters to reach 70. He was born in 1934, shortly before Elvis Presley.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> His new album, Dear Heather, is out next month. It includes a song about September 11, called On That Day.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Since his mid-50s, his stock has risen steadily. Late middle-age tends not to be easy for pop stars, if they get there at all, but it has smiled on Cohen. There have been several tribute albums and covers by Bono, REM and Johnny Cash. His influence has been cited by Nick Cave, Suzanne Vega and Rufus Wainwright, who said recently: \"I really believe he's the greatest living poet on earth.\"</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Cohen's albums regularly go to no 1 in Norway.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> In America, his last album entered the Billboard chart at number 143.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> In 2001 he said: \"When Alberta Hunter was singing many years ago, at 82, I came to New York just to listen to her. When she said 'God bless you', you really felt that you had been blessed. It's wonderful to hear a 20-year-old speaking about love. As the Talmud says, there's good wine in every generation. But I love to hear an old singer lay it out. And I'd like to be one of them.\"</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Birthday parties are planned in Toronto, Edmonton, Barcelona and Toowoomba, Queensland. In Barcelona, a singer will perform Cohen's songs in Catalan.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Cohen was 32 and an established poet and novelist before deciding that songwriting might pay better. When he first touted his songs around New York, agents said to him: \"Aren't you a little old for this game?\"</p> <p><strong>10</strong> He has never married - \"too frightened\". He had two children with Suzanne Elrod, and also had a long relationship with the film star Rebecca De Mornay.</p> <p><strong>11</strong> \"The heart,\" he says, \"goes on cooking, sizzling like shish kebab.\" He likes the image so much, he used it to interviewers in 1977, 1988, 1997 and 2001.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> He has used many musical styles, from acoustic folk to electro-pop. But his lyrics have made only one stylistic leap, from lush lyricism to dry humour. His vocals have gone from a limited but appealing wail to a heroically smoky rumble. Soon, he may be audible only to dogs.</p> <p><strong>13</strong> Cohen's maternal grandfather, a rabbi, wrote a 700-page thesaurus of Talmudic interpretations.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> His father, who was in the garment trade, died when he was nine.</p> <p><strong>15</strong> His middle name is Norman.</p> <p><strong>16</strong> His first band, formed when he was 17, was called the Buckskin Boys.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> In his high-school yearbook, he gave his ambition as \"world-famous orator\".</p> <p><strong>18</strong> At McGill University, he was president of the debating society.</p> <p><strong>19</strong> His friends were fellow poets. \"Each time we met, we felt that it was a landmark in the history of thinking, let alone poetry.\"</p> <p><strong>20</strong> Cohen was a poet and novelist before he was a pop star. He published his first volume of poetry at 22, and won a $2,000 scholarship to travel around Europe when he was 25.</p> <p><strong>21</strong> He liked the Greek island of Hydra so much that he bought a house there in 1960 for $1,500. It had no electricity or running water. He could live there for $1,000 a year, so he would go back to Canada, earn the money with his writing and head back to Hydra \"to write and swim and sail\".</p> <p><strong>22</strong> His second novel, Beautiful Losers, about a love triangle, was hailed by one reviewer as \"the most revolting book ever written in Canada\".</p> <p><strong>23</strong> His big break was meeting the folk singer Judy Collins. He sang Suzanne down the phone to her and she immediately promised to record it.</p> <p><strong>24</strong> He was then asked to lunch by John Hammond of Columbia Records, one of rock's greatest talent-spotters: he had signed Bob Dylan, and went on to discover Bruce Springsteen. Hammond asked Cohen to sing some songs in his room at the Chelsea hotel. He played six or seven, and Hammond said: \"You got it\". Cohen never worked out whether he meant he had a contract or merely a gift.</p> <p><strong>25</strong> A week later, they were in the studio, with Hammond as producer. Cohen started singing and Hammond said on the intercom: \"Watch out Dylan!\"</p> <p><strong>26</strong> The young Cohen's signature tune was Suzanne. He once called it \"journalism\", as the details were drawn from life in Montreal. Suzanne was a friend, Suzanne Verdal, who really did serve him tea and oranges in her loft by the river. Cohen wrote the line \"I touched your perfect body with my mind\" because she was married to a friend of his.</p> <p><strong>27</strong> Singing it in concert decades later, he sometimes found the emotions hard to unearth. \"I was never so good that I could make a song sound real or authentic without it being that, and if it isn't, people know. I find that quite a lot of red wine will do it.\"</p> <p><strong>28</strong> He is a lifelong manic depressive. Asked about drugs, he has said: \"The recreational, the obsessional and the pharmaceutical - I've tried them all. I would be enthusiastically promoting any one of them if they worked.\"</p> <p><strong>29</strong> From 1965 to 1968 he was a vegetarian. A few years later, he took up yoga.</p> <p><strong>30</strong> Some time in the early 70s, his songs were dismissed as \"music to slit your wrists to\". The phrase stuck. \"I get put into the computer tagged with melancholy and despair,\" Cohen said. \"And every time a journalist taps in my name, that description comes up on the screen.\"</p> <p><strong>31</strong> His hero is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. Cohen named his daughter after him: \"She's a lovely creature, and very inventive. She really deserves the name.\" He translated a poem of Lorca's into the song Take This Waltz, which took him 150 hours. </p> <p><strong>32</strong> On Anthem (1992), he wrote: \"There is a crack, a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.\" Later he said: \"That's the closest thing I could describe to a credo. That idea is one of the fundamental positions behind a lot of the songs.\"</p> <p><strong>33</strong> His song Chelsea Hotel No 2, about Janis Joplin, may be the only song overtly written by one pop star about sex with another. \"You said to me then, you preferred handsome men, but for me you would make an exception ... giving me head on the unmade bed, while the limousines wait in the street.\"</p> <p><strong>34</strong> Much later, he said: \"I never discuss my mistresses or my tailors.\" But for Joplin he had made an exception.</p> <p><strong>35</strong> One woman who resisted his charms was Nico, whom he met at Andy Warhol's club in 1966. \"The most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.\" She said she preferred younger men, but introduced him to Lou Reed, who had some of his books. \"We told each other how good we were.\"</p> <p><strong>36</strong> In 1968 he moved with Suzanne and the children to a cabin near Nashville. John Hammond said, \"Nashville was astounded by him, because they hadn't seen anything like him, and they never will again.\"</p> <p><strong>37</strong> Cohen has been with Columbia for 37 years, but relations are ambivalent. Accepting an award in 1988, he thanked Columbia and said: \"I have always been touched by the modesty of their interest in my work.\"</p> <p><strong>38</strong> When he wrote Bird on a Wire, Cohen felt he hadn't \"finished the carpentry\", but Kris Kristofferson said the first three lines would be his epitaph: \"Like a bird on a wire/ Like a drunk in a midnight choir/ I have tried, in my way, to be free\"</p> <p><strong>39</strong> When sport loomed ever larger in the 90s, some in the music business were taken by surprise, but not Cohen. \"In the 60s, music was the mode, the most important form of communication,\" he said in 1988. \"I think today it's sports. The sports figures in America are much more attractive and interesting and their lives are much more dangerous than the rock figures. They are in the traditional heroic mode.\"</p> <p><strong>40</strong> Asking him where the songs come from is fruitless. \"If I knew, I'd go there more often.\"</p> <p><strong>41</strong> His album Death of a Ladies' Man was produced by Phil Spector, the reclusive genius of girl-group pop. \"I was flipped out at the time,\" Cohen said later, \"and he certainly was flipped out. For me, the expression was withdrawal and melancholy, and for him, megalomania and insanity and a devotion to armaments that was really intolerable. In the state that he found himself, which was post-Wagnerian, I would say Hitlerian, the atmosphere was one of guns - the music was a subsidiary enterprise ... At a certain point Phil approached me with a bottle of kosher red wine in one hand and a .45 in the other, put his arm around my shoulder and shoved the revolver into my neck and said, 'Leonard, I love you.' I said, 'I hope you do, Phil.'\"</p> <p><strong>42</strong> Cohen has described the album they made together as \"grotesque\".</p> <p><strong>43</strong> In 1988 he released I'm Your Man, and reinvented himself as a boulevardier with synthesisers and jokes. \"Everybody knows you've been discreet,\" he sang, \"But there were so many people you just had to meet/ Without your clothes.\"</p> <p><strong>44</strong> Cohen's work has been chosen on Desert Island Discs by the artist Jack Vettriano (I'm Your Man), Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour (Anthem) and the singer and Velvet Underground viola player John Cale (Alexandra Leaving). The actress Gillian Anderson chose covers of two Cohen songs - Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah and Roberta Flack's Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye.</p> <p><strong>45</strong> In 1988, Cohen told Musician magazine: \"As you get older, you get less willing to buy the latest version of reality.\"</p> <p><strong>46</strong> A writer in the 1950s, a folk singer in the 60s, a has-been in the 70s, a cult rock star in the 80s, Cohen decided to become a monk in the 90s. He joined a Buddhist community on Mt Baldy, near Los Angeles: in the city of permanent summer, he had gravitated to the one part of town that had winters. He acted as driver to the senior monk or Roshi (teacher), a man in his 90s. Cohen was called Jikan, \"the silent one\".</p> <p><strong>47</strong> \"Cohen in Roshi's company was like a fish in water, or a non-fish in non-water, or like neither,\" wrote Leon Wieseltier, somewhat enigmatically. Cohen was clearer: \"I'm not looking for a new religion. I'm quite happy with the old one, with Judaism.\"</p> <p><strong>48</strong> In 1986, he made a guest appearance in Miami Vice as a character named Fran\u00e7ois Zolan, head of Interpol.</p> <p><strong>49</strong> In 1992 he released a song called Democracy, which was unlike anything else in his oeuvre or the pop canon - a satirical march, highly politicised although not party-political. It was later used by Ralph Nader in his presidential campaign, and sung by Don Henley at the MTV Ball during Bill Clinton's inauguration (\"slaughtered,\" according to Leon Wieseltier). The song came out after the LA riots of April 1992, but was recorded before them. \"Some people have suggested that it's prophetic. It's hard to wear that mantle. But when you're writing, your antennae go up, and you're sensitive to nuances in the air.\"</p> <p><strong>50</strong> Katie Melua, Britain's best-selling new singer of 2004, was asked recently what her ideal band would be. She picked John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on guitar, Eva Cassidy as the singer and Leonard Cohen as the songwriter.</p> <p><strong>51</strong> In 1995, Cohen was profiled in Interview magazine by Anjelica Huston, who described him as \"part wolf and part angel\".</p> <p><strong>52</strong> Cohen is always rewriting. In 1988 he was full of enthusiasm for a song he was writing called My Secret Life, but it took him another 13 years to get it right. \"I can't discard a verse until I've written it as carefully as the one I would keep.\"</p> <p><strong>53</strong> For many rock stars, age is something you handle with make-up, surgery or denial, but Cohen has faced up to getting old. \"Now my friends have gone and my hair is grey,\" he sang on Tower of Song in 1988, \"I ache in the places where I used to play.\" Seven years later, I asked him what had happened to those places. He replied with morose delight: \"I can't even locate them.\"</p> <p><strong>54</strong> Last year, Cohen was made a Companion to the Order of Canada by the governor-general, Adrienne Clarkson. A statement from her office described him as \"a venerated dean of the pop-culture movement\".</p> <p><strong>55</strong> There was a show at Edinburgh last month about Kurt Cobain, called Leonard Cohen Afterworld. The title came from the Nirvana song Pennyroyal Tea: \"Give me Leonard Cohen afterworld/ So I can sigh eternally.\"</p> <p><strong>56</strong> Cohen said of Cobain after his death: \"I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man. I see a lot of people at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school. There are always alternatives, and I might have been able to lay something on him.\"</p> <p><strong>57</strong> Cohen's fans form a loose-knit cult. A convention was held in New York in June, while the Brighton festival presented an evening of Cohen's songs performed by Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright and others under the direction of Hal Willner.</p> <p><strong>58</strong> Online, the faithful congregate at <a href=\"http://LeonardCohenFiles.com\">LeonardCohenFiles.com</a>. The webmaster is a Finn named Jarkko, who keeps a list of covers of Cohen's songs. So far, he has found 890, including 78 versions of Bird on a Wire, 44 of Hallelujah and 124 of Suzanne.</p> <p><strong>59</strong> Hallelujah was covered by Kathryn Williams, the young British folk singer, on her album, Relations. At a recent concert she introduced it by saying, \"I'd really, really, really like to shag Leonard Cohen, but I know his heart just couldn't take it.\"</p> <p><strong>60</strong> In 1995 Cohen's manager, Kelley Lynch, put together Tower of Song, a set of his compositions sung by bigger stars including Sting and Bono. She asked Phil Collins, who turned her down. Cohen himself sent Collins a fax, saying: \"Would Beethoven refuse the invitation of Mozart?\" Collins faxed back: \"No, unless Beethoven was on a world tour at the time.\" Cohen understood: \"It's kind of a pain in the ass, to think about somebody else's dismal songs when you're not even in the studio.\"</p> <p><strong>61</strong> As a marketing ploy, cafes in the US that had \"the Leonard Cohen vibe\" were sent a free copy of the Tower of Song album. \"I'd like to go to some of those,\" Cohen said. \"I can rarely locate my own vibe.\"</p> <p><strong>62</strong> His best-selling songs on Napster are Suzanne and Hallelujah.</p> <p><strong>63</strong> Cohen has probably the best manners in pop. When you ask how he is, he says, \"Can't complain\", as if he hadn't built a career on elegant lamentation. When he rings off, he says \"So long\", as he did, famously, to a lover named Marianne.</p> <p><strong>64</strong> His songs have featured in dozens of films from McCabe and Mrs Miller to Natural Born Killers, and television dramas including The West Wing and The L Word. They provide an index of his rising stock: the log at LeonardCohenFiles.com lists 13 productions from the 70s and 80s, and 63 since 1990.</p> <p><strong>65</strong> There's an episode of Absolutely Fabulous in which Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley go to an awards ceremony and Saunders has to make a speech. She is so drunk that she slurringly recites the words of Bird on a Wire. The audience doesn't appear to notice.</p> <p><strong>66</strong> Cohen was much admired in 1960s France. The president, Georges Pompidou, was reputed to take his LPs on holiday, and it was said that if a Frenchwoman owned one record, it was likely to be by Cohen.</p> <p><strong>67</strong> Cohen's latest published work is a self-portrait for the Canadian current-affairs magazine the Walrus.</p> <p><strong>68</strong> He always has excellent backing vocals. \"My voice sounds so much better when a woman is singing with me,\" he has said. \"Some dismal quality is neutralised.\"</p> <p><strong>69</strong> His son Adam is a singer-songwriter who has just released his second album, Melancolista, written in French. His daughter Lorca is a chef turned antiques dealer.</p> <p><strong>70</strong> In 1994, Cohen said: \"If you're going to think of yourself in this game, or in this tradition, and you start getting a swelled head about it, then you've really got to think about who you're talking about. You're not just talking about Randy Newman, who's fine, or Bob Dylan, who's sublime, you're talking about King David, Homer, Dante, Milton, Wordsworth, you're talking about the embodiment of our highest possibility. So I don't think it's particularly modest or virtuous to think of oneself as a minor poet. I really do feel the enormous luck I've had in being able to make a living, and to never have had to have written one word that I didn't want to write.</p> <p>\"But I don't fool myself, I know the game I'm in. When I wrote about Hank Williams 'A hundred floors above me in the tower of song', it's not some kind of inverse modesty. I know where Hank Williams stands in the history of popular song. Your Cheatin' Heart, songs like that, are sublime, in his own tradition, and I feel myself a very minor writer. I've taken a certain territory, and I've tried to maintain it and administrate it with the very best of my capacities. And I will continue to administrate this tiny territory until I'm too weak to do it. But I understand where this territory is.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>With acknowledgements to <a href=\"http://LeonardCohenFiles.com\">LeonardCohenFiles.com</a> and Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen by Ira B Nadel (Bloomsbury, 1996).

  "After witnessing an early Ramones' rehearsal, fellow New York musician David Johansen laughingly told guitarist Johnny Ramone, who has died of prostate cancer aged 55, to give up immediately: his band were so inept as to be beyond hope. It is difficult to imagine what modern rock music would sound like had he taken the New York Dolls' vocalist's advice. <p>Despite, or because of, their technical shortcomings, the Ramones may well have been the most important rock band of the 1970s. Their defiantly reductive approach - their songs lasted two or three minutes, rarely used more than three chords and never contained guitar solos, which Johnny Ramone could not play - changed rock music forever, offering the first recorded proof of the punk dictum that a band with even the most rudimentary abilities could make innovative, wildly exciting records. </p> <p>The extent of their influence is almost incalculable: everyone from the Sex Pistols and the Clash, to current boyband Busted, owes the Ramones a debt. </p> <p>Johnny Ramone was born John Cummings, the son of a middle-class, Long Island family. He later moved to Forest Hills, Queens, where his neighbours included Douglas \"Dee Dee\" Colvin, a teenage heroin addict and sometime male prostitute, and the equally troubled Jeffrey \"Joey\" Hyman, who had spent time in a mental institution. </p> <p>Initially, their friendship was based around a shared taste for alcohol and solvent abuse, but, in 1974, Cummings bought a guitar with the proceeds from his job as a construction worker, the trio formed the Ramones, with drummer Tommy Erdelyi - and changed their surnames accordingly. The band were inspired equally by the noisy, basic rock'n'roll of the Stooges and the New York Dolls, unfashionable 1960s bubblegum pop and the early albums of the Beach Boys and the Beatles. Their name came from a misappropriation of Paul McCartney's original stage name, Ramon. </p> <p>Their image - tight t-shirts, ripped jeans, leather jackets - was borrowed from the teenage hustlers with whom Colvin occasionally worked. Their songs reflected either the aimlessness of suburban adolescents - a life of boredom, punctuated by comic books, horror films and cheap drugs - or daringly turned Hyman's struggle with mental illness into a string of cartoonish jokes: I Wanna Be Sedated, Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment, Teenage Lobotomy, Cretin Hop. </p> <p>Those who saw their early live performances at the Manhattan club, CBGBs, frequently compared the Ramones not to other music, but to an elemental force. \"You were hit with this blast of noise, you physically recoiled from the shock of it, like a huge wind,\" remembered journalist Legs McNeil. No other band played as fast: in an era when progressive rock bands played two- or three-hour concerts, marked by costly lighting and and sets, and extensive virtuoso soloing, the average Ramones' show lasted 18 minutes.</p> <p>Their eponymous 1976 debut album featured 14 tracks in less than half an hour, as did its follow-up, Leave Home. Ignored or mocked by the US rock mainstream, they were enthusiastically received by England's nascent punk movement. While they never gained commercial success in America, they had a string of UK top-40 singles, including the top-10 hit Baby I Love You. Their third album, Rocket To Russia (1977), honed their sound to perfection, but was to prove their artistic zenith. </p> <p>Subsequent attempts to broaden their appeal with ballads and glossier production fell flat, as did their starring role in Roger Corman's 1979 film, Rock And Roll High School. Sessions with producer Phil Spector were artistically unsatisfying and scarred by personality clashes - Dee Dee Ramone later claimed that Spector had pulled a gun on the band - but yielded their biggest-selling album, End Of The Century (1980). During the 80s and early 90s, they released a string of unsuccessful albums, though they remained a popular live attraction. </p> <p>After the Ramones broke up in 1996, Cummings sold his guitars and amplifiers, and announced his retirement. In recent years, he became best known for his rightwing political views: a lifelong Republican, he expressed admiration for Richard Nixon and Rush Limbaugh, and used the band's 2002 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to make a pro-George Bush speech. None of this did anything to harm the Ramones' legacy. Once openly reviled as incompetent, the music contained on their first three albums has become a cherished part of America's cultural heritage. </p> <p>After Joey Ramone's death from lymphatic cancer in 2001, a street in New York was renamed after him, while a New York Times poll voted the band's debut one of the 20 most influential albums of the 20th century, alongside works by Miles Davis, Billie Holiday and Elvis Presley. </p> <p>Ramone is survived by his wife. </p> <p>\u00b7 Johnny Ramone (John Cummings), musician, born October 8 1948; died September 15 2004</p>",
  "<p>Philip Hampton, the new chairman of supermarket group J Sainsbury, faces a bruising confrontation next week with big City investors over the potential \u00a34m payoff to his predecessor, Sir Peter Davis. </p> <p>Mr Hampton is scheduled to address investors at the Association of British Insurers for the first time since taking up his position in July. </p> <p>The meeting at the ABI, whose members control a quarter of the stock market, comes as the supermarket chain is finalising the terms of any payoff to Sir Peter, who was ousted after a bruising shareholder revolt against a controversial \u00a32.3m bonus. </p> <p>City investors expect an update on plans for the payoff, which they want to be kept to a minimum. </p> <p>Mr Hampton is expected to be questioned about potential changes to the boardroom that sanctioned the payment to Sir Peter. </p> <p>The investors are also expected to seek assurances from Mr Hampton that the company will not allow a rerun of the circumstances that led to the bonus being awarded in the first place. </p> <p>Sainsbury's has said its remuneration committee, chaired by Keith Butler-Wheel house, the chief executive of Smiths Group, sanctioned the bonus on the advice of pay consultants Towers Perrin. </p> <p>The bonus was in the form of 864,000 free shares, which were to be handed over to Sir Peter next July - even though the company's profits and sales had fallen. The second part of the bonus scheme was due to kick in this year, which increases the value of his potential payoff. </p> <p>Mr Hampton, a former finance director of Lloyds TSB, is a popular choice among investors for the chairman's seat at Sainsbury's. </p> <p>The 50-year-old was parachuted into the group shortly after it admitted its profits would fall to levels last seen in 1989 and that it is losing market share to Tesco, Asda and Morrisons-Safeway. </p> <p>The ABI refused to comment yesterday. However, a spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said: \"We are committed to meeting major shareholders, and this meeting is part of a programme\". </p> <p>The supermarket group, which is still 35% controlled by the eponymous founding family, has cancelled the controversial award of free shares and made it clear that it does not want to make any bonus payment to Sir Peter. </p> <p>However, the matter is in the hands of lawyers, and it was reported last weekend that Sainsbury's legal team had realised that the group was obliged to hand over the controversial \u00a34m payment. </p> <p>The company insisted last night that no agreement had been reached. \"We are still in legal negotiations,\" the spokeswoman said. </p> <p>Sir Peter, who joined Sainsbury's as chief executive in March 2000, dramatically quit the chairman's role two months ago, when it became apparent that shareholders were planning to vote against the company's remuneration report at its annual meeting. </p> <p>However, even his departure was not sufficient to head off an embarrassing rebellion at the annual meeting in July. Only the support of the founding family prevented the remuneration report being voted down.</p>",
  "President Vladimir Putin had been prepared to release terrorists detained in Ingushetia and offered to swap up to 700 adults for the children held hostage in their school in Beslan before the explosion that led to storming of the building, Russia's top official on Chechnya said yesterday. <p>Aslanbek Aslakhanov, Mr Putin's Chechnya adviser, said yesterday that he had landed at the regional airport on September 3 prepared to negotiate. \"I had 700 people ready to replace the hostages,\" he said. </p> <p>The envoy said the list included Olympic champions and political leaders, but he did not say which. \"We were ready to release detained terrorists from Ingushetia. We were bargaining over the number of children that would be released.\" </p> <p>But he was too late - before he could leave the airport, the shooting had started. \"I thought that the storming of the school had begun, and I began to curse. I felt completely disoriented,\" he said. </p> <p>An estimated 330 people died in the siege, about half of them children. </p> <p>The envoy's admission came as a surprise to most commentators in Moscow. Mr Putin has always refused to negotiate with Chechen separatists. </p> <p>Mr Aslakhanov defended Mr Putin's decision to negotiate with the hostage takers. \"To accept their ultimatum is one thing, negotiating to save hostages is another.\" </p> <p>His statement came as Russia's chief prosecutor made the rare admission that corruption in the police and the armed forces put at risk attempts to stop future attacks. </p> <p>The prosecutor-general, Vladimir Ustinov, said the two suicide bombers who blew up two separate flights out of Domodedovo airport on August 24, killing 90 people, had bribed their way on board. </p> <p>The two women were flagged as security risks after arriving from the southern city of Makhachkala and taken in for questioning. But a police captain let them go without a search, and a ticket seller accepted 4,000 roubles (\u00a376) for himself and another 1,000 roubles (\u00a319) for an Air Sibir employee to help them get on their next flights without further checks. Corruption among officials had reached \"dangerous\" levels, said Mr Ustinov. </p> <p>The 32 hostage-takers in the Beslan school siege are believed to have travelled from outside the republic, passing several military checkpoints. But apparently their trucks full of weapons were not challenged. </p> <p>Mr Aslakhanov also warned that corruption among Russian officials has had a devastating impact on the country's poor, unstable southern republics. He estimated that as much as 80% of government money meant to help rebuild Chechnya had been siphoned off by corrupt officials. </p> <p>\"There are no guarantees against future terrorist attacks,\" said Mr Aslakhanov, calling for full investigations into reports of kidnapping and mop-up operations in Chechnya by Russian soldiers. \"If you have permanent financing [from abroad] and difficult social conditions, you will have terrorism.\" </p> <p>Bribery is an accepted part of life in Russia, where state salaries are so low that small sums routinely paid to everyone from traffic police to doctors are seen as essential salary supplements. </p> <p>Attempts to crack down on large-scale corruption have led to several high-profile resignations, including yesterday the deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, Lt-Gen Dmitry Morozov. </p> <p>\"It's an endemic disease inside the Russian bureaucratic system,\" said Andrei Piontkovsky, a political analyst who heads Moscow's Centre for Strategic Studies. </p> <p>A survey by the independent Levada polling agency this week showed more than half of respondents blamed corrupt security services for the Beslan attack.</p>",
  "<p>Eldridge Pope, the 167-year-old West Country pub group, is to be sold to turnaround expert Michael Cannon for \u00a342.3m, nine months after former Whitbread beer boss Miles Templeman was appointed part-time executive chairman. </p> <p>Mr Cannon, who made his name reviving struggling pub chains, has offered 171p a share - a 12% premium on the closing price before the 150-strong pub group revealed it was in takeover talks this month.</p> <p>The recommended sale is at a discount to Eldridge Pope's net asset value, which at the half-year was said to be worth 196p a share - supported primarily by freehold properties valued six years ago at \u00a381m.</p> <p>Mr Cannon's bid vehicle is taking on an onerous \u00a315m debenture and has pledged to continue a programme of increased pension contributions to plug a \u00a315m deficit in the group's pension scheme.</p> <p>Mr Cannon's commercial director Peter Large said Eldridge Pope shareholders would be able to take an equity option instead of cash. While the private business will not pay dividends, it is expected to be sold within five years. Many Pope family members, who control about 30% of shares, have already indicated an appetite for equity.</p> <p>Mr Large drew parallels with Mr Cannon's turnaround of the Morrells of Oxford estate, which was acquired in 1998 for \u00a348m and sold four years later for \u00a367m, with a further \u00a311m of assets retained by the pub buyout specialist. The same management team will take over at Eldridge Pope.</p> <p>Among its priorities will be a three-year, \u00a314m spending programme and a focus on increasing disappointing food sales. Outgoing chief executive Susan Barratt yesterday conceded her \"back to basics\" strategy was \"taking longer than we had hoped to turn around the business\".</p> <p>In May the Dorchester-based business, which operates 109 pubs and owns a further 42 tenanted pubs, said pre-tax losses for the six months to April 3 had widened from \u00a369,000 to \u00a3909,000, with like-for-like sales down 2.3%.</p>",
  "<p>In February this year Graham Coutts, a 35-year-old musician, was jailed for life for the murder of Jane Longhurst, a music teacher and one of his girlfriend's best friends. He had strangled her with a pair of tights, and kept her body in a storage unit for several weeks before setting fire to it. </p> <p>Longhurst's older sister, Sue Barnett, says she felt only contempt as she watched Coutts across the crowded court room in Lewes, East Sussex. \"I remember staring at him when he was making up lies about Jane's death being an accident, as she took part in consensual sex with him, and just thinking what a truly pathetic specimen of humanity he was.\" </p> <p>Eighteen months after her death, Barnett is still coming to terms with the loss of her only sister. The two had become especially close, she says, when Jane was in her teens and began to look up to her for advice about career and life (Barnett, now 40, was eight years older). \"Our house was always filled with music, as my dad was a jazz and classical musician. Both Jane and I played the violin when we were younger and she became a very talented viola player. In the end, however, she decided to teach. She loved her job and she looked on the pupils as 'her' children.\" </p> <p>It was music that had given her something in common with Coutts, a guitarist in a Who tribute band, and she was a regular visitor at the Hove flat he shared with his girlfriend - her good friend and former colleague, Lisa Stephens. \"She was very open and trusting and would not have seen Graham as any threat because he was Lisa's partner,\" says Barnett. \"I last saw her on March 2 [2003], when she told me Graham and Lisa were expecting twins, and she was murdered on March 14.\" </p> <p>Longhurst's disappearance from her Brighton home in March last year sparked a massive police search. She was last seen by her partner, Malcolm Sentance, on the morning of March 14 as he left for work. It was a Friday, and she had the day off from her job at Uplands special needs school. Her body was discovered more than a month later, after a motorist spotted a corpse burning in woods near Pulborough, West Sussex. </p> <p>Initially, police were baffled by how well-preserved the body was. But following a tip-off from an employee at the Big Yellow Storage Company in Brighton, they discovered that Coutts had hired a unit under another name and deposited a large white box there some weeks previously. Records showed that he had used his pin number to access the unit 10 times before trying to dispose of Longhurst's body. Inside the unit, police found a blood-stained rope and a condom containing traces of Coutts' semen and Longhurst's DNA, suggesting that he may have had sex with her corpse. </p> <p>During the trial it emerged that Coutts had an addiction to internet sites devoted to images of violence against women. The day before the murder, he had spent two hours on the internet, looking at sites dedicated to necrophilia. He visited these sites after the murder, and sometimes just minutes after visiting Longhurst's body. </p> <p>Coutt's predilection for violent sex and necrophiliac fantasies stretched back to his teens, long before he owned a computer. In the witness box, he conceded that he had had a fetish for women's necks since he was about 15, and had later become addicted to surfing the net for necrophilia. </p> <p>An ex-girlfriend, Sandra Gates, gave the court a graphic account of their violent sex life. He liked her to lie completely silent during sex, she said, while he tied tights and knickers around her neck, telling her they would improve her orgasms. \"I never lost consciousness but I feared I would,\" said Gates, who claims she stayed with Coutts because she was extremely vulnerable and lonely after a divorce. After Coutts was sentenced, she told reporters that he had once admitted to her, \"I get the most awful feelings that I am going to strangle, kill and rape a woman.\" She had tried to get him to seek help, she said, but he had cancelled a counselling session because the psychologist was a woman. </p> <p>Lisa Stephens, who gave birth to Coutts' twin sons while he was awaiting trial, has always maintained that they had a normal sex life - though she was aware of his asphyxia fantasies. She took the twins to see him in Belmarsh once before the trial, but their relationship ended soon after his arrest. She, too, has called for curbs on internet pornography. </p> <p>More than anything else, Barnett feels that it was Coutts' addiction to violent internet pornography that was the crucial factor in him committing murder. A definite connection between his internet use and the murder is difficult to establish, but Barnett believes that the accessibility of such websites fosters violent fantasies, as well as making it easier for people to convince themselves that such desires are somehow normal and acceptable. \"If they view hundreds of these images day after day, they begin to see them as commonplace,\" she explains. \"They become totally desensitised to the suffering of the women - and they realise that other men share their fantasies. It's then a much shorter step to actually carrying out those fantasies.\" </p> <p>Longhurst's family and friends were shocked to learn at the trial that such material is freely available on the internet - and appalled that there has been no clampdown since Coutts' conviction. The sort of sites he frequented, many of them accessible for free, feature lurid photographs of women being strangled and abused, detailed descriptions of necrophiliac acts, and grotesque claims that some women actually want to be strangled or have their throats cut as the ultimate sexual thrill. Viewers are able to discuss their \"interests\" via email and online message boards. </p> <p>The Internet Watch Foundation was established in 1996 following an agreement between government, police and internet service providers to promote voluntary self-regulation. But since many necrophilia sites are hosted by anonymous individuals outside the UK, it is difficult for the British authorities to take action; prosecutions under the Obscene Publications Act are possible only if a site is based in this country. The sites also tend not to feature child pornography, which is what galvanises much of the international effort to tackle internet pornography. </p> <p>Dr Julia Davidson, a criminologist at the University of Westminster who has carried out extensive research into sex offences, says that offenders' motivation is often shrouded in self-justification and denial. \"In Coutts' case,\" she says, \"this was obviously a long term, ongoing fantasy, which he then worked out how to turn into reality. He may well have been looking for a potential victim for some time, spotted Jane, and then developed strategies to target her. </p> <p>\"The internet does not create sex offenders, but it provides the perfect opportunity to indulge fantasises which play a big part in this type of offending. If it spurred someone to carry out a violent fantasy on even one occasion, that's once too many - and let's not forget, the women who appear on these websites are victims, too.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, Barnett gave up her former job as a trainer at Hewlett Packard to set up and run the Jane Longhurst Trust, a campaign dedicated to closing down sexually violent websites. She aims to put pressure on internet service providers to close down or filter out these sites, and to persuade the authorities and people in all areas of the computer industry to promote internet safety. </p> <p>In March, Barnett met the home secretary David Blunkett to discuss her concerns. Following their meeting, Blunkett raised the issue with the US deputy attorney general Jim Comey in Washington, where a joint US-UK initiative to tackle violent sex sites was discussed. This week a Home Office spokesman said the government was looking at ways of strengthening the law, and was consulting the internet industry and other interested parties. While the government supports effective action in relation to sites hosted in foreign countries, the spokesman said, this could only be achieved through international cooperation. </p> <p>Barnett is also exploring the wider link between violent images and crime, compiling details of cases such as that of 17-year-old Warren Leblanc, who stabbed his friend, Stefan Pakeerah, 14, to death in Leicester in February after reportedly becoming obsessed with the computer game Manhunt. Her aim is to inform parents and other responsible adults of the dangers of unrestricted access to the internet and violent computer games. </p> <p>\"We're not saying the internet is a terrible thing,\" she says. \"It's a wonderful facility, which provides great learning tools for children. But it would be hard to find anyone who does not agree that what's available has to be more closely monitored. There are all sorts of useful products on the market to restrict access, and we're talking to manufacturers and distributors with the aim of putting together a guide to buying and installing software.\" </p> <p>Throwing her energy into a campaign dedicated to her sister's memory is one way of working through her grief, but is she not allowing the murder to engulf her life? </p> <p>\"I know there is a danger of that,\" she admits. \"But no - I'm determined to work hard but to set boundaries. Personally, I feel it has increased my confidence and helped me communicate better. </p> <p>\"But I'm the kind of person, after hearing what we did in court about the part the internet played in Jane's murder, I couldn't stick my head in the sand. What's out there is not healthy and if there is a chance I can help to stop another woman being murdered, then I have to do this.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more information contact <a href=\"mailto:info@janelonghursttrust.org.uk\">info@janelonghursttrust.org.uk</a></p>",
  "When George Bush first identified the two Middle East members of his \"axis of evil\", Iran clearly ranked as a far more formidable adversary than Saddam Hussein's Iraq. <p>But President Bush went after the easier target instead. So \"did we invade the wrong country?\" asks a leading commentator, Charles Krauthammer, speaking for many neo-conservative hawks as the US refocuses on Iran. </p> <p>From their standpoint, it must surely look as if they did. For the neo-cons, overthrowing Saddam was nothing if not regional in purpose, the opening phase of a grand design to \"transform\" the entire Middle East. </p> <p>But such are the region's cross-border dynamics that success was never going to be assured in one country unless it embraced others too. </p> <p>Yet it is hardly success in Iraq that accounts for the increasingly urgent concerns about Iran; it is more likely the spectre of catastrophic failure. For if the Islamic Republic was always the most dangerous of \"rogue states\", it is now more dangerous than it was at the outset of the Iraq adventure. It simply has to be subdued. </p> <p>\"If nothing is done\", Mr Krauthammer argues, \"a fanatical terrorist regime openly dedicated to the destruction of the 'Great Satan' will have both nuclear weapons and the terrorists and missiles to deliver them. All that stands between us and that is either revolution or pre-emptive strike. Both of which are far more likely to succeed with 146,000 American troops and highly sophisticated aircraft standing by just a few miles away in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Such talk does not seem to frighten the mullahs. They do worry about the strategic encirclement which the US has thrown around them. Yet, paradoxically, they are emboldened too. For they think that if they are more vulnerable, so - over-extended and floundering - is their adversary. </p> <p>They are saying it loud and clear: we have strategic assets to match America's, and the cost of any US or Israeli attempt to exploit their military advantages against us will be great and region-wide. </p> <p>Iran claims it is not developing nuclear weapons. But much of its behaviour, at least that of the once again dominant, hardline clerical establishment, indicates a deliberate attempt to cloak the claim in ambiguity, nourishing the convictions of all those who believe that Iran is developing such weapons. Certainly, at least, it wants to create the impression that it is acquiring the kind of firepower that only weapons of mass destruction can supply. </p> <p>If the Islamic Republic does not actually have the unconventional means, not yet at least, to lend substance to its militant rhetoric, it does have conventional means that have long been an intrinsic, largely surreptitious, part of its whole \"revolutionary\" modus operandi. </p> <p>In fact, through Iraq, the removal of its arch-enemy Saddam and the emancipation and new aspirations of the long-suppressed Shia majority, it has them in new and providential abundance. \"Some military commanders in Iran\", said the defence minister, Ali Shamkani, \"are convinced that preventive operations which the Americans talk about are not their monopoly. We too are present from Khost to Kandahar in Afghanistan, in the Gulf, and we can be in Iraq, where US forces won't be an element of strength, but our hostage.\" </p> <p>No wonder that, for the new Iraqi government, the Muqtada al-Sadr rebellion was as much about Iran as it was about Mr Sadr. </p> <p>And then there is always Lebanon and Hizbullah, that everlasting flashpoint in reserve. Quiescent of late, Hizbullah is ever ready to re-enter the jihadist arena, drawing on the arsenal of rockets with which, according to Israel, Iran has been systematically supplying it. </p> <p>\"This\", says the veteran Israeli military analyst Zeev Schiff, \"is an Iran-Syria-Hizbullah array\", and its use, almost certain in the event of an American or Israeli strike on Iran, could escalate into \"all-out war\". </p> <p>It is clear that the mullahs do not want a full-scale showdown; in parading their assets they seek to deter, rather than provoke. In fact they have always wanted better relations with the US, provided they get something in return, and that they, not their reformist rivals, control the process. If anything, the urgency now lies on the other side; hence the urgings of pundits like Mr Krauthammer to \"strike before Iran's nukes get hot\". </p> <p>But perhaps the real wild card lies less in the Iranian \"rogue state\" than it does in what amounts to the Israeli one. Israel has repeatedly warned that it may sooner or later take direct action to stop an Iranian nuclear bomb \"going critical\". </p> <p>As Amos Perlmutter, Michael Handel and Uri Bar-Joseph recount in their book Two Minutes over Baghdad, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, was once part of a three-man inner circle that kept even the very sympathetic administration of President Ronald Reagan completely in the dark as they planned and carried out the daring 1981 airstrike on Iraq's Osirak nuclear plant. </p> <p>That exploit had little visible fallout. But a repeat performance against Iran today would be universally perceived as American in spirit, even if exclusively Israeli in execution, and the whole Middle Eastern mess which America came to Iraq to clean up would instantly cross a new threshold in scale, virulence and unpredictability.</p>",
  "'Bring them on!\" President Bush challenged the early Iraqi insurgency in July of last year. Since then, 812 American soldiers have been killed and 6,290 wounded, according to the Pentagon. Almost every day, in campaign speeches, Bush speaks with bravado about how he is \"winning\" in Iraq. \"Our strategy is succeeding,\" he boasted to the National Guard convention on Tuesday. <p>But, according to the US military's leading strategists and prominent retired generals, Bush's war is already lost. Retired general William Odom, former head of the National Security Agency, told me: \"Bush hasn't found the WMD. Al-Qaida, it's worse, he's lost on that front. That he's going to achieve a democracy there? That goal is lost, too. It's lost.\" He adds: \"Right now, the course we're on, we're achieving Bin Laden's ends.\" </p> <p>Retired general Joseph Hoare, the former marine commandant and head of US Central Command, told me: \"The idea that this is going to go the way these guys planned is ludicrous. There are no good options. We're conducting a campaign as though it were being conducted in Iowa, no sense of the realities on the ground. It's so unrealistic for anyone who knows that part of the world. The priorities are just all wrong.\" </p> <p>Jeffrey Record, professor of strategy at the Air War College, said: \"I see no ray of light on the horizon at all. The worst case has become true. There's no analogy whatsoever between the situation in Iraq and the advantages we had after the second world war in Germany and Japan.\" </p> <p>W Andrew Terrill, professor at the Army War College's strategic studies institute - and the top expert on Iraq there - said: \"I don't think that you can kill the insurgency\". According to Terrill, the anti-US insurgency, centred in the Sunni triangle, and holding several cities and towns - including Fallujah - is expanding and becoming more capable as a consequence of US policy. </p> <p>\"We have a growing, maturing insurgency group,\" he told me. \"We see larger and more coordinated military attacks. They are getting better and they can self-regenerate. The idea there are x number of insurgents, and that when they're all dead we can get out is wrong. The insurgency has shown an ability to regenerate itself because there are people willing to fill the ranks of those who are killed. The political culture is more hostile to the US presence. The longer we stay, the more they are confirmed in that view.\" </p> <p>After the killing of four US contractors in Fallujah, the marines besieged the city for three weeks in April - the watershed event for the insurgency. \"I think the president ordered the attack on Fallujah,\" said General Hoare. \"I asked a three-star marine general who gave the order to go to Fallujah and he wouldn't tell me. I came to the conclusion that the order came directly from the White House.\" Then, just as suddenly, the order was rescinded, and Islamist radicals gained control, using the city as a base. </p> <p>\"If you are a Muslim and the community is under occupation by a non-Islamic power it becomes a religious requirement to resist that occupation,\" Terrill explained. \"Most Iraqis consider us occupiers, not liberators.\" He describes the religious imagery common now in Fallujah and the Sunni triangle: \"There's talk of angels and the Prophet Mohammed coming down from heaven to lead the fighting, talk of martyrs whose bodies are glowing and emanating wonderful scents.\" </p> <p>\"I see no exit,\" said Record. \"We've been down that road before. It's called Vietnamisation. The idea that we're going to have an Iraqi force trained to defeat an enemy we can't defeat stretches the imagination. They will be tainted by their very association with the foreign occupier. In fact, we had more time and money in state building in Vietnam than in Iraq.\" </p> <p>General Odom said: \"This is far graver than Vietnam. There wasn't as much at stake strategically, though in both cases we mindlessly went ahead with the war that was not constructive for US aims. But now we're in a region far more volatile, and we're in much worse shape with our allies.\" </p> <p>Terrill believes that any sustained US military offensive against the no-go areas \"could become so controversial that members of the Iraqi government would feel compelled to resign\". Thus, an attempted military solution would destroy the slightest remaining political legitimacy. \"If we leave and there's no civil war, that's a victory.\" </p> <p>General Hoare believes from the information he has received that \"a decision has been made\" to attack Fallujah \"after the first Tuesday in November. That's the cynical part of it - after the election. The signs are all there.\" </p> <p>He compares any such planned attack to the late Syrian dictator Hafez al-Asad's razing of the rebel city of Hama. \"You could flatten it,\" said Hoare. \"US military forces would prevail, casualties would be high, there would be inconclusive results with respect to the bad guys, their leadership would escape, and civilians would be caught in the middle. I hate that phrase collateral damage. And they talked about dancing in the street, a beacon for democracy.\" </p> <p>General Odom remarked that the tension between the Bush administration and the senior military officers over Iraqi was worse than any he has ever seen with any previous government, including Vietnam. \"I've never seen it so bad between the office of the secretary of defence and the military. There's a significant majority believing this is a disaster. The two parties whose interests have been advanced have been the Iranians and al-Qaida. Bin Laden could argue with some cogency that our going into Iraq was the equivalent of the Germans in Stalingrad. They defeated themselves by pouring more in there.

  "As a scion of one of the richest families in America, Laurance Rockefeller owned several homes and estates, many cars including a Bentley, a plane, a 65ft speedboat, and a collection of valuable paintings including works by Gainsborough and Bonnard. Yet in 1976 he wrote an article in Reader's Digest entitled The Case For A Simpler Life. <p>It was one of various paradoxes surrounding Rockefeller, who has died aged 94. He was the fourth of six offspring of John D Rockefeller, whose own father of the same name founded the 19th-century oil monopoly that financed the dynasty. But although his older brother Nelson became a four-term governor of New York and a vice-president under President Gerald Ford, and his younger brother Winthrop was governor of Arkansas, Laurance was never attracted to politics. </p> <p>However, he certainly enjoyed wealth, doubling his own original fortune many times over - but he maintained an enthusiasm not just for financial accumulation, but for new and often risky enterprises. His other great love was nature, and he poured millions into preserving American landmarks, and helped to create a forest of redwoods in California, an unspoiled tract along the Hudson river, a preserve in the Wyoming Grand Teton mountains, and a large national park in the US Virgin Islands. </p> <p>Named after his grandmother Laura, he had an odd childhood, even for such a rich family. His multimillionaire father was frugal and paid the five boys for cleaning shoes and swatting flies, for which they earned 10 cents per 100, and he made them keep accounts. They attended an experimental school based on the idea of learning by doing, and Laurance's interest in travel and exploration was encouraged, stimulating his later passion for the natural environment. </p> <p>Rockefeller entered Princeton University in 1929 and graduated in philosophy, having taken every course in the subject that the college offered. Two years at Harvard law school was enough for Laurance; he quit, deciding law was not for him. He turned to business and when his grandfather died in 1937, he inherited his New York stock exchange seat. </p> <p>But he avoided predictable investments. Both he and his wife (the former Mary French, sister of Nelson's room-mate at Dartmouth college), admired the modernistic furniture of Alvar Aalto, a Finnish architect. Against advice, Rockefeller opened a successful store specialising in Aalto's creations. </p> <p>During the second world war Rockefeller served in the US navy as a procurement officer, but continued to follow new investments. One such venture was to join the first world war flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker and invest in his fledgling Eastern Airlines. Eventually, it became the most profitable airline to emerge in the 1950s, and Rockefeller was the main shareholder. </p> <p>Altogether, he invested in hundreds of new firms including electronics (Intel) and computers (Apple). By 1959, he had invested $8.7m in two dozen companies, which boosted his holdings to more than $28m. In 1969 he established Venrock Associates with members of his family and Rockefeller-backed institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Sloan-Kettering cancer centre. Venrock backed over 220 new ventures, many of them in advanced technology. </p> <p>Rockefeller advised every US president from his appointment by Eisenhower as chairman of the Outdoor Recreation Review commission to study the nation's leisure-time needs. It was President Lyndon Johnson who asked him to intervene in a dispute over a proposed redwood park in northern California, and although Rockefeller compromised by siding with timber interests rather than environmentalists, without his input it is doubtful whether the park, an awesome preservation of the ancient trees, would have been created. </p> <p>He also formed RockResorts in 1956, which built holiday spots in Puerto Rico, the British Virgin Islands, and Hawaii, which emphasised a closeness to nature. All enabled guests to swim, snorkel, ramble, or watch birds, and in retrospect, they were forerunners of the modern eco-tourist industry. </p> <p>Despite his altruism, Rockefeller continued to make big money. He was 377th in this year's Forbes magazine list of 587 billionaires, with $1.5bn. In 2001, he donated his $30m, 1,106-acre holding in Wyoming to the federal government as part of the surrounding Grand Teton national park. </p> <p>Rockefeller's wife died in 1997 and their four children survive him. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Laurance Spelman Rockefeller, financier and philanthropist, born May 26 1910; died July 11 2004</p>",
  "<p> I was recently taking part in one of those recurring and depressing duties that comes with adulthood - updating my will. This onerous task is obviously bothering a few people at the moment, because while I was going through the dreary process, I read a few articles raising a question that had occurred to me but hadn't had time to think about: to whom should I leave my data - and access to it?</p> <p> It wasn't mentioned in the booklet of sample will elements I was using. That covered topics such as houses and kids, but it should have had additional specimen clauses along these lines: \"I leave the 100GB external Firewire drive containing all of my emails and the back-ups of all of my personal documents, my iPhoto library and my iTunes to my wife. This volume was encrypted by Mac OS X using AES-128 and the password is the name of the band we saw together on our first date followed by the age of our first female cat when she died.\" </p> <p> This may seem silly, but could become a serious problem in the future. My wife will need my username and password for Barclays, BT, British Airways and our family blog - and there was nothing about that in the booklet, either. </p> <p> It's the same with the home wireless network, mail accounts, Amazon or anything else. And in the past day or so, I've looked through email that's a couple of years old to find the serial number for some software I reinstalled and the address of a friend.</p> <p> This stuff is important. Without officially passing on this information, it could become lost - and with it, access to hordes of data that is becoming increasingly crucial to our everyday lives. </p> <p> It's not hard to see how our legacy becomes less physical as more of our world moves online: soon our virtual goods and chattels may be worth more than our real ones. </p> <p> Then there's the question of work. At the office, sensitive emails are encrypted and signed using PGP or S/MIME. If I happen to fall under the proverbial bus, how will that data be recovered? I have a back-up of my PGP keyring - but without the passphrase, it's useless. So should I put the passphrase in my will and bequeath it to our IT manager? Or should he arrange for all of our back-up keyrings and passphrases to go into escrow now?</p> <p> While it would make good corporate sense to escrow encryption keys, I don't want to leave behind this information to somebody else because there's no way I will let it out of my control. Now look forward a few years. All of my email (both at work and at home) is signed and encrypted using key pairs bought from a post office and kept, not in my will, but on my national ID card. Access to these keys requires my fingerprint, which nobody else has. </p> <p> All of my files are encrypted as well. So how is anyone going to access the book I was working on, my letter to the bank or that picture of the kids once my ID card is cut up and in landfill? When I'm gone, access to that information will be gone, too, unless we plan for such an eventuality now.</p>",
  "<p>No matter how fast your computer, you'll find it grinding to a halt every now and again as you try to do too many demanding things at once. You could add more processors, but that means more heat and more complexity. Processors keep getting faster, but the rest of your hardware isn't keeping up - and there's still a limit to how much they can do. Is this a time when two heads are better than one? </p> <p>Last week's Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco saw the chip giant follow in the footsteps of Sun and AMD by announcing a processor road map that includes multiple-core technologies. Multi-core chips are an approach that means much more bang for your IT buck, but it's also one that needs new hardware, new operating systems and - in some cases - new application software before you will see real benefits. It will also need a new approach to software licensing from the IT industry. </p> <p>Multiple-core chips are just what you would expect: several processor cores on a single die. It's an approach that chip designers find attractive, because it means they can improve performance by adding extra cores, rather than by developing chips that operate at ever higher clock frequencies. It's also an approach that gets around one of the biggest bottlenecks in system design: memory speed. There's little point in ramping up processor speed if memory chips can't receive or deliver data quickly enough to keep up. </p> <p>At IDF, Intel demonstrated systems running with a sample version of its Montecito chip. A next-generation Itanium, this is a dual-core system with each chip handling four separate threads. Getting Montecito into production will be a massive undertaking, with each chip containing more than 1.7bn transistors. However, Intel is promising significant performance gains, especially for scientific computing. </p> <p>High performance systems such as Nasa's Project Columbia supercomputer should see the greatest benefit from Montecito, and this may be where Itanium will finally find its niche. Columbia is a Linux system based around SGI's Altix platform, and uses more than 3,000 Itanium 2 processors, with a total of more than 10,000 planned. It is used to handle complex simulations such as predicting the weather. Switching Columbia from Itanium 2 to Montecito will add significant amounts of computing power - even pre-production chips give a 1.5x to 2x performance boost. A multi-core Columbia could help Nasa keep ahead of Caribbean hurricanes at the same time as putting the Shuttle into space and getting man back on the moon. </p> <p>So what about multi-core for the rest of us? Pentium 4 and Xeon chips will go the same way, as will Intel's low power ARM-based XScale processors, used in PDAs and smartphones. Intel is planning to ship its first dual-core chips for desktops and servers in 2005, and predicts that by 2006 more than 40% of new desktop PCs, more than 85% of new servers, and more than 70% of mobile systems will use dual- and multi-core chips. Meanwhile, AMD is promising dual-core Opteron processors for the middle of next year, with desktop chips coming in the second half. </p> <p>Even if the real world doesn't match the PowerPoint slides, we are going to see a big change in the technologies that power the computers around us over the next two years. </p> <p>You will be able to run all your programs faster. Alternatively, you could use a dual-core PC to virtually separate work and play, and even trap viruses and malware before they damage your data. Don't worry about processor-intensive 3D user interfaces in future versions of Windows: you could devote a whole core to running them if necessary. </p> <p>Then there's the environment to think about. Dual-core processors can run cooler than a ramped-up single-core system, and will also keep power requirements down. </p> <p>Technologies that Intel developed for the mobile Centrino chips manage each core, and allow lower power use by turning cores on and off as needed. If your PC isn't busy, you could find it's only using one core, or that both cores in a dual-core chip are operating at different clock speeds and voltages. With laptop-style power management, a dual- core system should therefore be more economical to run than today's desktop computers. </p> <p>Apple and AMD have touted the idea of the \"megahertz myth\", pointing out (correctly) that processor performance is more than just clock speed. Dual-core is another way of delivering more power for the same number of clock cycles, and Intel has now converted to this way of thinking. It is talking about \"pervasive parallelism\" as a key to the next wave of IT spending - and the next generation of the web. </p> <p>The first production Intel dual-core processors for general purpose use are unlikely to support the hyper-threading found in Pentium 4 and Xeon today, which, to an extent, already enables one processor to work as though it were two. There's no technological reason why Intel's multi-core chips shouldn't also support hyper-threading, and it is part of the Montecito design. However, there may be licensing issues with operating systems. Even a Windows XP Professional Edition license only supports two processors, and Windows sees each thread in a hyper-threaded system as a separate processor. </p> <p>Intel says it is talking to software vendors but the early days of multi-core licensing are likely to be a minefield for the end user - especially if your new four-way, four-core server suddenly turns into a 16-CPU system when it comes to licensing your enterprise software. It could quadruple software costs overnight. </p> <p>Operating systems will need to be modified to handle the new chips with their expanded instruction sets, and developers will need to learn how to take advantage of the new features. While most applications will work out of the box, the enhanced languages needed to take advantage of parallelism are still on the drawing board. Microsoft's Cambridge Research Lab has released an experimental language, Comega, which makes handling the many possible processing threads in a complex multi-core system easy to understand. </p> <p>Intel is developing a hardware-based virtual machine monitor to help tools such as VMware and Virtual PC take advantage of hardware, rather than patching operating systems. Other Intel technologies planned for multi-core chips are intended to make processors work well with secure code, and to help management tools control desktop PCs and servers - even if they've had a catastrophic hardware failure. But you may need to wait for the next version of Windows, Longhorn, to get the most out of next-generation processors. </p> <p>The arrival of PC dual-core processors will mean a new generation of more powerful, cooler and more economical PCs. And that can't be bad.</p>",
  "<p>Buying a home under English law is one of the most stressful life experiences we undergo voluntarily. For three years, the government has promised to reduce one of these stresses - and causes of expense - by putting online the process of conveyancing. That promise, which figured in the 2001 Queen's Speech, has now taken a step closer to reality. </p> <p>The government's Land Registry this month invited companies to bid for a contract to supply IT systems to allow e-conveyancing. The prime contractor will supply systems to electronically manage the procedures for buying, selling and registering a property. </p> <p>If all goes well, a pilot service is to begin in early 2006, just outside the government's December 2005 deadline for all public services to be e-enabled. After that, the Land Registry says, an \"incremental process of national rollout\" will take place during 2007. </p> <p>The equivalent Scottish project, called e-registration, is due to go live in October 2006, according to the agency Registers of Scotland. </p> <p>\"When it comes to the delivery of public services, e-conveyancing is one of the government's highest priorities,\" said David Lammy, the minister responsible, last month. </p> <p>The new system will gradually replace current procedures, where hundreds of staff enter information into the registry's database from forms submitted on paper. It the largest of its kind in the world, processing property worth \u00a31m every minute. </p> <p>Before e-conveyancing goes live, however, several concerns need to be addressed. One worry is security. Access to the service will be via \" public and private channels\", the agency says. This means that, potentially, large numbers of solicitors and conveyancing firms will have access to systems that register the ownership of a property. </p> <p>Solicitor Ken Byass, chair of the Law Society's electronic law committhey say they are, or is it some pirate in Russia?\" </p> <p>Adequate security controls, based on digital signatures, may be too complex for everyday use, Byass says. \"We have concerns that by the time it's finished, it will be so difficult that the process might as well stick to paper.\" </p> <p>E-conveyancing is also likely to show up shortcomings in existing databases of land and property. These are updated by individual local authorities and often contain inaccurate or out-of-date data. </p> <p>One council that cleaned up data recently found inconsistencies in the names of 40 streets, 1,100 buildings, 5,800 postcodes and even two towns. The exercise raised \u00a3150,000 a year in council tax from addresses the council previously didn't know about. </p> <p>One problem is that there is no up-to-date national list of streets. Many stretches of road are not named, and are described in different ways for different purposes. </p> <p>Likewise, there is no complete list of addresses in Britain with all the data that would be needed by conveyancing systems. Three organisations hold separate lists of properties, all containing different sets of information. They are the Ordnance Survey, the Royal Mail and the Local Government Information House, a commercialorganisation run by local authorities. Attempts to create a single database have foundered because each organisation earns income from its data, and argues that this cash flow is essential for maintaining its database. </p> <p>In 2002, a multi-agency project called Acacia set out to develop \"a single national infrastructure for Great Britain of definitive addresses and related property information and mapping to support thousands of key services from government and business\". </p> <p>One of its aims was to tackle the problems of dealing with inconsistencies in addresses, and of objects without postal addresses, such as church halls and public conveniences. Another was to see if a single register could be created by matching data within existing databases. </p> <p>The conclusion, quietly posted on the web earlier this year, was that there is no way forward until commercial and intellectual property issues are resolved. It recommended this be done \"as a matter of urgency\". </p> <p>Although officials at the Land Registry believe they can go ahead without a new national addresses database, some experts are worried. </p> <p>\"We need to agree what the definitive list is,\" says Adrian McKeon, managing director of Infoshare, a firm specialising in cleaning up government data. \"If this hasn't been agreed, then how can we be sure e-conveyancing can work?\" McKeon estimates that about 85% of addresses held electronically will be accurate. \"The issue is to know whether a piece of data is good or bad.\"</p>",

  "Let us compare the fates of two army majors. Major Charles Ingram, of Easterton, near Devizes, in Wiltshire, appeared on a television programme called Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in September 2001. He won; but the programme makers were uneasy. They sensed something odd had been happening. They refused to pay him the money. <p>Some of his answers appeared to have been prompted by tactical coughs from the audience. He, his wife and the tactical cougher were put on trial. In July 2003, Mr and Mrs Ingram were convicted of deception and fined \u00a315,000 apiece. The major resigned from the army, having been told that they'd kick him out if he didn't. Going voluntarily meant he could save his pension and still use the title of major. He said he regretted that his service must cease but accepted that he'd caused the army embarrassment. It was spared a possible further embarrassment when, a few months later, he got a two-year conditional discharge for insurance fraud. Major Ingram, we may conclude, was a silly, dishonest fellow. But at least nobody died. </p> <p>One evening in July 2000, a second major, Giles Stibbe, driving home to Oxfordshire in his girlfriend's Mercedes from Warminster barracks, on the western fringes of Wiltshire, decided to overtake a lorry that was slowing him down. Crossing a continuous white line on a bend on the A350 near Trowbridge, he came face to face with a Toyota sports car. \"I used my triptronic gear system to give me oomph to overtake,\" he told the police later. \"The MR2 came at me like a bullet. I thought, 'My god, a boy racer,' and completed my pull in.\" The driver of the sports car braked so violently that he lost control and smashed into a Ford Escort. </p> <p>The sports car driver and his passenger were killed. So was a five-year-old girl in the Ford. Her brother, aged seven, was badly injured and will use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The major was traced by the police with the help of a CCTV camera. He told them he was unaware of the smash behind him. </p> <p>In October 2001, Major Stibbe was acquitted on three charges of causing death by dangerous driving, but found guilty of dangerous driving. The jury members were no doubt influenced by evidence that the Toyota driver had been racing the car behind. They were also unaware, until the judge disclosed it in passing sentence, that Stibbe had been convicted for motoring offences four times in the previous six years. </p> <p>The judge told the court he had thought of imposing a sentence of community service, but had decided against it after hearing that Stibbe's language skills were likely to be required in Afghanistan. The court was further told that Stibbe would have been in line for promotion but for this conviction, and that even a sentence of community service would mean he would have to resign his commission. The judge fined Stibbe \u00a3750, ordered him to pay \u00a35,000 towards costs and banned him from driving for two years. The major's driving, he said, had been thoroughly dangerous. There was also \"the inescapable fact that you told lies in your evidence and showed, in my judgment, an arrogant disregard of the truth\". </p> <p>But this time the army was not so embarrassed. In December the following year, the major was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He did not go to Afghanistan; he was sent to the Balkans. And last week the Ministry of Defence announced that, in recognition of his work in coordinating peacekeeping operations in Banja Luka and Sarajevo, he was being awarded an OBE, which the Queen is due to present to Stibbe later this year. </p> <p> The families of the young men who died in the sports car had denounced his promotion, and this news of his honour outraged them still more. Two local papers, the Devizes Gazette and the Wiltshire Times, are demanding that he should refuse it. A spokesman for the MoD said the honour was a recognition of Stibbe's work in former Yugoslavia and was \"not related to anything else\". \"He received a fine and a driving ban,\" the spokesman said, \"but that doesn't detract from the fact that he excelled in his field and from the very important work that he did.\" No mention was made of the judge's finding that Stibbe had lied on oath. Others faced with such strictures have found themselves charged with perjury. </p> <p>Lt Col Stibbe himself told the Daily Telegraph: \"I always try to do my best to care for other people. My sympathies are, of course, with the families and always will be. As I said at the time of my trial, I am more sorry than words can say for the incident.\" In the circumstances, with three people dead and another maimed for life, \"incident\" seems an odd choice of word. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:McElsewhere@aol.com\">McElsewhere@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Richard North, chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group, has been ousted from his post after a boardroom coup by non-executive directors. </p> <p>The move comes two years after he fought off a hostile bid for the business's then parent group, Six Continents. </p> <p>His departure comes as the hotel group is selling more than \u00a32.2bn of assets and returning \u00a31bn to shareholders. </p> <p>That marks the completion of a list of long-standing demands from disaffected shareholders, furious at acquisitions pursued by the Six Continents conglomerate while Mr North was its finance director. </p> <p>In January 2002 a leaked letter from fund management group Hermes described the group's strategy as \"value destroying\" and many shareholders targeted chairman Sir Ian Prosser and Mr North for blame. </p> <p>Despite plans to break up Six Continents, formerly known as Bass, relations with shareholders continued to decline and within months corporate raider Hugh Osmond launched a \u00a35.6m hostile bid. </p> <p>The offer was rejected, but not before Mr Osmond accused Six Continents' management of destroying almost \u00a36bn in value over 10 years and described Mr North as \"a muppet\". </p> <p>Investors eventually backed Six Continents' break-up proposals, which has seen the group split into pub operator Mitchells &amp; Butler and Inter Continental, run by Mr North. In May shareholders again raised questions about Mr North's pledges on asset sales. He was forced to admit he had been \"a little too delphic\". </p> <p>InterContinental also plans to spin off the Britvic soft drinks business, in which it holds a 47% share - possibly through a float next year. </p> <p>Yesterday former Safeway chairman David Webster, who took over from Sir Ian at the start of the year, made clear that he and his fellow part-time directors had ousted Mr North. </p> <p>\"Richard had the right qualities for us over the last two years when financial skills were important,\" said Mr Webster, who will run the business until a new chief executive is found. </p> <p>\"Now we need someone with skills focused on our global brand.\" </p> <p>Yesterday shares in InterContinental closed the session 14.5p higher at 636p. </p> <p>Mr North, who spent 23 years as an accountant at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said in a statement: \"I would love to continue to manage InterContinental ... but I recognise that someone else whose business background has been developing and managing brands may be better placed to ensure the company creates maximum value for shareholders.\" </p> <p>Mr North will step down at the end of the month and be entitled to a payoff under the terms of the 12-month notice period in his contract. </p> <p>Last year he received a basic salary of \u00a3429,000.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The flops<br>(Misconceived projects that came to a premature end)</strong></p> <p><strong>National Centre for Popular Music, Sheffield:</strong> The Centre opened at a cost of \u00a315m, including \u00a311.4m from the lottery, and went 11.2% over budget. It attracted 80,000 visitors compared with an annual forecast of 400,000. A parliamentary accounts committee report stated that the Arts Council England believed that the market assessment for the centre had been wrong, despite the analysis of likely visitor numbers that had been carried out by management consultants.</p> <p><strong>The Harbourside Centre concert hall, Bristol:</strong> The grand project was abandoned before it had even been built, but not before \u00a35m had been spent on it.</p> <p><strong>Dovecot Arts Centre, Stockton-on-Tees:</strong> The centre received a \u00a37.5m lottery grant and went 20% over its original budget. Although the centre exceeded its forecast for visitor numbers, income targets were not achieved and it closed in 2001. It later reopened as Arc, a producing and presenting venue.</p> <p><strong>The Centre for Visual Arts, Cardiff:</strong> The centre cost \u00a39m to set up, including \u00a32.2m from the lottery. It expected 200,000 visitors in the first year but less than a quarter of this target visited in the first few months only earning \u00a360,000 in admissions. MP Jon Owen Jones branded the centre as 'not viable' and it closed in November 2001.</p> <p><strong>The Life Force Centre, Bradford:</strong> The centre next to the Cathedral in the city included interactive areas exploring faith and belief. It was opened in July 2000, costing \u00a35m of which \u00a32.2m was from lottery money, but closed in 2001 after seven months. It was projected to attract 40,000 people a year, but in its first week it had just 62 paying visitors.</p> <p><strong>The Earth Centre, Doncaster:</strong> An educational centre which aimed to become 'the centre of first choice for the understanding and application of sustainable development in everyday life'. The \u00a350m scheme received \u00a336m of lottery money and opened in 1999. It was plagued by a disinterested response and low visitor numbers. This summer the trustees closed the centre and handed control over to the council.</p> <p><strong>The survivors<br>(Projects that have not performed up to expectations but have managed to avoid oblivion)</strong></p> <p><strong>National Glass Centre, Sunderland:</strong> \u00a3 6.9m of lottery money was spent on the centre that is 'dedicated to promoting glass in all its uses'. The project was 5.9% over budget and delayed by 12 months. The \u00a312.6m centre is running an unsustainable annual deficit of \u00a3110,000.</p> <p><strong>Baltic Centre, Gateshead:</strong> The \u00a346m arts centre has been described as the north's answer to the Tate Modern, in London. The lottery contributed \u00a333.4m to its completion. The centre was in trouble just six months after opening. An Arts Council report expressed alarm over management and staffing, the absence of 'any ongoing business planning work', the lack of accounting and the considerable uncertainty over this year's budget.</p> <p><strong>Gateway Project, Carlisle:</strong> Conceived as a way of 're-uniting Carlisle Castle with the city's historic core'. Millions of pounds were pledged towards two footbridges and an art gallery to be topped by a glass pyramid in the medieval town at the end of Hadrian's Wall. By 2001 costs had soared from \u00a36.4m to \u00a311m.</p> <p><strong>National Botanic Garden of Wales:</strong> The gardens include Britain's largest single span greenhouse. The \u00a343m initial funding for the project included a grant of \u00a321m from the lottery. The gardens developed a shortfall of around \u00a3500,000 a year. Organisers had expected a regular public subsidy like other botanical gardens. A \u00a33m rescue package was introduced in May 2004. </p> <p><strong>The success stories<br>(Rare lottery funded projects which beat the odds to win popularity and economic viability)</strong></p> <p><strong>The Eden Project, Cornwall:</strong> A group of giant greenhouses (or biomes) that have captured the public imagination in a big way. The biomes represent three different climate zones: humid tropical, warm temperate, and cool temperate. The project cost \u00a386m to complete and has been a huge success. The project created a \u00a3450m boost to the Cornish economy and some 2,500 jobs.</p> <p><strong>Angel of the North, Newcastle-Gateshead:</strong> The sculpture cost \u00a3800,000 of lottery grant funding. It is the largest sculpture in Britain and possibly the largest angel sculpture in the world. It is also one of the most viewed pieces of art in the world - seen by more than one person every second, 90,000 every day or 33 million every year.</p> <p><strong>The Tate Modern, London</strong> The Millennium Commission contributed \u00a350m of lottery money towards the \u00a3134m scheme to convert Bankside Power Station into an art gallery. It attracts 3.5 million visitors a year.</p>",

  "<p>QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD</p> <p>The Fiver may be a dedicated follower of fashion - check out those fingerless gloves - but ever since we mistakenly blew a monkey on a Don Vutch cap at Hoxton market, only to be laughed straight outta there, we've avoided expensive mistakes like the clap. So even though we tossed a lazy V-sign at fate by skipping Mark Hughes's introductory press conference at Ewood Park today, we were confident our already-written-so-we-can-devote-our-time-to-doing-bugger-all piece would hold us in good stead. Blackburn's new boss would thunder in, mutate into the Incredible Hulk and warn his players what a tough time they were in for, right? Wrong.</p> <p>In fact, Hughes - the same Hughes who could eat three whole shredded centre-halves for breakfast in his playing days - was quieter than a shy mouse. \"My management style is my own,\" he whispered, as the Fast Show's Deaf Stuntman ploughed head-first into the nearest door. \"I'm not going to be something I'm not.\" Hughes will at least stay with Wales for their next two World Cup qualifiers. \"I don't think it's a problem,\" he said, as the Fiver asked whether the size of Ian Rush's hurtful hooter would affect his pulling potential. \"The Welsh games I'm all prepared for. Everything's in place.\"</p> <p>But what about the fact that Hughes has less experience in his chosen field than any footballer since Andy Cole started spittin' some rhymes? \"If people say, 'You haven't got club experience', then I'd agree, but if people say, 'You've no experience', I'd disagree,\" Hughes said. What he wouldn't disagree with is that Blackburn have had a stinking start to the campaign. \"I think it's very early in the season. It's a difficult one,\" he mused, as the Fiver cheekily slipped in the Brand-or-Feltz question, \"but I'd like to think we'd go into the game [with Portsmouth on Saturday] in good heart.\" And with that, the Fiver toddled off to get its ears syringed.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"As for the Wales job, I would prefer a Welshman.\" Dean Saunders, a 41-1 rank outsider for the job of Welsh manager, spots a cunning way to improve his odds.

At no point in the proceedings, however, should a bunch of malingerers from the local estate wander in and start digging in to the veal satimbocca with their fingers.</p> <p>All of which, most of you will have realised, means Championship grafters Millwall are gatecrashing the Euro Vase party tonight, in the hope of getting a bit closer to the main course before being pointed in the direction of the tradesman's entrance. Hungarian champions Ferencvaros are standing in their way. \"It's an exciting time but we've got to keep our feet on the ground,\" whispered chairman Theo Paphitis, edging towards the buffet. \"We're going to see how far we can get and hopefully get to where we can make some financial gain,\" he added, with one eye on the chandelier above the stairway.</p> <p>Newcastle, meanwhile, know their way round by now, and manager Graeme Souness was busy networking in the hope of finding out more about Israeli outfit Bnei Sakhnin. \"We're going into the unknown.

  "National insurance would be scrapped and replaced with a \"national health contribution\" under plans announced by the Liberal Democrats today. <p>The party's leader, Charles Kennedy, said that having a \"single tax for a single service\" would increase accountability and transparency. </p> <p>He said it was \"a tax change not a tax rise\" and would simply mean money was earmarked for health services, making \"perfect sense\" for the NHS. </p> <p>\"It does not require any increase in national insurance contributions to meet the current plans to fund the NHS, which we believe are sufficient to drive through the improvements required,\" Mr Kennedy said. </p> <p>The proposal came in a new health policy document published ahead of the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth. </p> <p>Other measures outlined included the scrapping of targets to free up doctors and nurses to treat patients and moving control away from Whitehall. </p> <p>The Lib Dems also stressed the importance of preventing ill-health in the first place, with measures to make people take responsibility for their own well-being. </p> <p>Health spokesman Paul Burstow said the party wanted to stop schools \"turning out couch potatoes and microwave chefs\". </p> <p>The party said it would develop \"health literacy\" programmes in schools to teach healthy eating habits and cooking skills. </p> <p>It would also make schools develop nutrition policies governing the use of vending machines and set national nutritional standards for school meals in efforts to tackle obesity. </p> <p>Children would also be given more opportunities to exercise during the school week. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy said the party would also look at developing a so-called \"health MOT\" so patients would be called in for tests when necessary and knew when they had to take action to control issues such as high blood pressure or cholesterol levels. </p> <p>Clear labelling for food products, such as a \"traffic light\" system to indicate foods with high salt, sugar or fat content, would give shoppers control over their diet, Mr Kennedy added. </p> <p>The party would also ask the Food Standards Agency and communications regulator Ofcom to develop a policy on restricting advertising of unhealthy foods during children's television. </p> <p>They would also establish a Healthy Eating Fund to be supported by voluntary contributions from the food industry, with companies asked to contribute a percentage of their advertising spending. </p> <p>The fund would be used to support public information initiatives to promote healthy eating and projects to improve the availability of healthy foods. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy said: \"This is not about a nanny state. This is about making sure people know the risks associated with the way they live their lives and can act to live more healthily.\" </p> <p>The document also talks about tackling the \"root causes\" of ill-health such as poor housing and fuel poverty. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy said this would give those on lower incomes control over their own health. </p> <p>\"The government has tried to control the NHS from Whitehall. </p> <p>\"This policy is about freeing frontline staff to get on with treating patients and freeing patients to manage their own health. </p> <p>\"The core values of the NHS are as relevant today as ever - a service based on a person's needs, not on how much they can afford. A service free at the point of delivery. A common good funded through the tax system. </p> <p>\"For all the talk about patient choice, what people want is quality healthcare on their doorstep,\" Mr Kennedy said. </p> <p>Mr Burstow said that the targets culture in the NHS had actually led to poorer care of patients and extra costs. </p> <p>He said waiting list targets meant extra pressure on hospital beds, meaning a high turnover of patients and a greater risk of hospital-acquired infections such as the MRSA \"superbug\". </p> <p>Mr Burstow added that by scrapping targets they would make sure \"that the sickest got treated the quickest\". </p> <p>He also pledged to end charges for those requiring long-term care in any setting, whether that was their own home or residential care. </p> <p>Mr Burstow went on: \"This policy will provide a quality NHS, delivered locally and available to everyone. </p> <p>\"Doctors and nurses are kept in a straitjacket of targets and tick boxes which prevents them from offering the best care to patients. </p> <p>\"It's time Whitehall got off the backs of frontline NHS staff and let them get on with the job they were trained for.\" </p> <p>He said that all patients should be in the driving seat of their own healthcare.</p>",

  "The spotlight of blame for the Commons invasion today fell on Westminster as the Metropolitan police confirmed they believed yesterday's security breach was an \"inside job\". <p>Eight men are still being questioned over the storming of the Commons chamber during the yesterday afternoon's hunting debate, but today Met commissioner Sir John Stevens confirmed that a letter purportedly from MPs giving clearance for the intruders had been forged.</p> <p>He said: \"We have some reasons to believe there was an inside job in terms of how they got into the Palace of Westminster and how they got on to the floor of the Commons itself.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, today specifically urged that the \"antiquated\" serjeant at arms be replaced with a new director of security.</p> <p>Mr Hain was prevented by the Speaker from discussing security at this morning's Commons session - the last before the party conference season - but issued a statement later warning that we now lived in the \"age of the suicide bomber\".</p> <p>He said: \"The blunt truth is that the House of Commons is operating as if in a bygone age. This is the age of the suicide terrorist and our security arrangements are antiquated. </p> <p>\"The house must now act urgently together with the House of Lords and appoint a director of security with operational authority working directly to the security services and the Metropolitan Police - albeit ultimately accountable both to the Speaker and to the Lords' chairman of committees.\" </p> <p>Sir John also said a rethink might be needed on how authority and control at Westminster were organised. </p> <p>Later it emerged that police had earlier been alerted three times before the invasion to the presence of a known hunt supporter, wearing a hard hat, inside a security cordon thrown around Westminster. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat MP Paul Keetch disclosed on the ITV News Channel that one of his constituents had ended up dialling 999 after trying to tell police about the hunt supporter heading to join the Commons intruders disguised as contractors. </p> <p>The BBC later said one of its journalists had been tipped off about the protest. </p> <p>In a statement the BBC said: \"A BBC journalist was contacted by someone they had never met before. The information they received was passed into our news-gathering operation. </p> <p>\"The decision not to act on it further was taken at an operational level and in any respect no violence was threatened. Indeed the source made it clear no violence would be used. It was not clear to those handling the information that the demonstration would in fact definitely take place.\"</p> <p>Under the present system the serjeant at arms is in overall control within the Palace of Westminster, with contracted Metropolitan Police officers working under his direction. </p> <p>\"Yesterday's incident causes me to reflect on whether this is the best way for security arrangements to continue in the future,\" Sir John said. </p> <p>\"For instance, the contract states that police officers cannot go into the chamber without express permission and direction of the serjeant at arms. Perhaps this is something we need to revisit.\" </p> <p>The commissioner said all eight protesters were dressed in suits and some had worn tabards, clipboards and hard hats, but he denied that officers policing Parliament Square had overreacted and attacked demonstrators. </p> <p>This morning the Speaker, Michael Martin, told politicians from both sides - including the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, who had been expected to brief MPs on the government's response to the pro-hunting invasion of the chamber - that submissions should be made to him in private. </p> <p>A security review of parliament's anti-terrorism defences, led by MI5, is already underway, following anti-war protests in the public gallery and the purple flour attack on the prime minister by the Fathers4Justice campaign. </p> <p>The only visible sign today of yesterday's drama was the presence of extra armed police officers patrolling Westminster. </p> <p>This morning the shadow home secretary, David Davis, called for the five men who invaded the Commons chamber to face criminal charges, and called the breach a \"spectacular failure\" of security. </p> <p>It was also announced today that the new Independent Police Complaints Commission is to carry out an investigation into allegations of police misconduct following yesterday's demonstration in Parliament Square. </p> <p>TV cameras on the scene showed footage of a line of police officers beating protesters repeatedly with truncheons, with no more visible provocation than a push or surge in the crowd, plus ocassional missiles being thrown.</p> <p>Several demonstrators complained to journalists that they had been beaten for no reason. This morning two of the 15 demonstrators from the clashes in Parliament Square were released without charge. </p> <p>Tony Blair's official spokesman said the prime minister recognised there were strong emotions on all sides of the debate. \"He also recognised there was a legitimate right to peaceful protest, but the emphasis must be on peaceful protest,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>Police in south London are still questioning 13 people - including six for violent disorder, two for breach of the peace, two for affray, one for being drunk and disorderly, one for threatening behaviour and another for disorderly conduct. </p> <p>Eight men - including Otis Ferry, the son of rock star Bryan Ferry - were being quizzed by police about the dramatic protest inside the Commons, and an internal investigation is underway to identify a parliamentary pass-holder who is believed to have guided the men towards the Commons chamber. </p> <p><b>Parliament Act</b></p> <p>MPs leave parliament today for the party conference season, returning on October 11. The controversial hunting bill itself went to the House of Lords today, where, as is traditional, it was given an unopposed first reading. Peers will debate the bill's second reading on Tuesday October 12. </p> <p>In effect, peers have two options: they can reject the ban outright, in which case it will be forced through by the Commons and come into effect without any delay; or they can accept it, along with an 18-month delay before its implementation. </p> <p>There is a clear majority in favour of keeping hunting in the upper house, but the government has left no doubt that any attempt to derail the bill will be quashed by the invocation of the Parliament Act. </p> <p>The act allows the Commons to overrule the Lords if it rejects a piece of legislation approved by MPs in two successive sessions.</p>",
  "Gunmen kidnapped a Briton and two Americans from a house in central Baghdad today, the US and British authorities said. <p>The three men were employed by GSCS, a building contracting firm based in the United Arab Emirates. The Foreign Office would not release the name of the British hostage but said his family had been informed. </p> <p>The US embassy named its kidnapped citizens as Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong but gave no further details. </p> <p>US troops fanned out across the relatively wealthy al-Mansour neighbourhood, home to a number of embassies and foreign companies, to investigate and question witnesses. Neighbours said they had heard two vehicles drive up to the men's two-storey house at dawn. They later noticed that an iron gate in the wall around the house had been left open. As it was normally closed, the neighbours rang the police.</p> <p>Ziad Tareq, 19, said he had been walking down the street when he saw a man dressed in black, his face covered with a red scarf, dragging one of the hostages by the collar and pushing him into a car parked outside the house.</p> <p>A police official, who asked for his name not to be used, said a car was missing from the house where the westerners were allegedly taken. </p> <p>He said the three had apparently been in the garden when the attack took place, and there had been no sign of fighting. </p> <p>Neighbours said they did not know exactly who was living there. There were no signs outside the house indicating the occupants' identity and the main door was locked. A white communications mast could be seen on the roof. Several foreign contracting companies and security firms are based in the area. </p> <p>Insurgents waging a 17-month campaign in Iraq have kidnapped more than 100 foreigners in an attempt to force US and allied forces to leave the country. </p> <p>At least 26 drivers, contractors and journalists have been executed; dozens more have eventually been released alive. Around 20 hostages are still being held, including two French journalists and two Italian aid workers. </p> <p>The Italian women, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, both 29, were abducted by armed men from their offices in central Baghdad. They were working on school and water projects for the aid group Un Ponte Per... (A Bridge To...). There is no word on their fate. </p> <p>The French reporters, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, were kidnapped last month by a militant group demanding that France rescind a ban on wearing headscarves in school. Paris refused, and the law is now in effect.</p>",

  "<p>Director Martin Scorsese is being sued for failing to undergo a medical examination prior to starting directing duties on his latest film, the period drama Silence, according to the BBC.</p> <p>The report claims that Scorsese is being taken to court by Hollywood Gang Productions for breach of contract because he missed a check-up which was vital to ensure the movie was properly insured against illness. </p> <p>The lawsuit was filed at Manhattan superior court on September 3, said Richard Golub, the lawyer for Hollywood Gang. \"All we want to do is stick a thermometer in him,\" he added. </p> <p>The six-page lawsuit claims the maverick director of Gangs of New York ignored repeated requests to \"submit to such physical examination\", despite agreeing to do so in February this year. The company's plans to insure itself for $1m (\u00a3557,000) against anything happening to Scorsese were therefore left in limbo. The suit seeks legal fees of at least $10,000 (\u00a35,500). </p> <p>In the film, a group of Jesuit priests in 16th Century Japan try to convert Samurai to Christianity. Scorsese himself entered a seminary in 1956 and seriously considered entering the priesthood. </p> <p>He was unavailable for comment.</p>",
  "<p>Reviewing Steve Bell's Apes of Wrath is a tough task. The difficulty? How not to sound too sycophantic, for the Guardian cartoonist has produced another masterpiece.</p> <p>Sharp, funny and a pleasure to hold, it tells the \"shocking story of the war on terror in glorious colour\". The ape in question is of course US President George Bush, whom Bell has immortalised for thousands as a slack-jawed, arm-swinging chimpanzee.</p> <p>Fans of Bell's work will recognise his cast of characters: a poodle Tony Blair, with a union jack stuck up his anus; a baby William Hague, confined to an electric pushchair; and bomber Clare Short, her face the nose of a B52.</p> <p>But it is President Bush with whom he has the most fun: twisting his features in wilder and wilder flights of fancy without once losing the essence of the man, frequently depicting his chimp-pout as the barrel of a gun. </p> <p>The words - it is supposedly narrated by the president himself - are also a pleasure. The glossary at the back is a particular joy. Those familiar with Bell's cartoon strip, If, will recognise the phrases but won't be able to suppress a snort of laughter.</p> <p>Airbs are apparently folks who are mainly moozlums, Hungrovia is somewhere in eastern Yurp, while xylophone seekers are what keeps Primester Tony Blair awake at night.</p> <p>Apes of Wrath is not, however, just a collection of fun cartoons and good Bush gags. It is also a cry of fury against the Bush presidency, and what Bell names the Blair sycophancy. </p> <p>If Art Spiegelman's graphic book, In the Shadow of No Towers, was drawn more in sorrow than anger, Bell has taken the opposite approach. Even opponents of the president will find themselves wincing at the treatment he metes out.</p> <p>With Bell's increasing popularity in America, largely spread through the international success of Guardian Unlimited, it is amazing that he has not yet become a global brand; a sort of counter-culture Walt Disney if you will.</p> <p>Like the creator of Mickey Mouse, he has a series of instantly recognisable characters; many of them anthropomorphised like the cast of many a Disney film.</p> <p>If the world will queue up in multiplexes for Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and the anti-McDonalds Super-Size-Me, surely it would pay to see If, the Movie. Apes of Wrath will do admirably until that hits the screens.</p>",
  "Johnny Ramone, the co-founder of seminal punk band the Ramones, has died at the age of 55, it was announced today. <p>The guitarist, who had fought a five-year battle against prostate cancer, died in his sleep at his Los Angeles home yesterday afternoon. He was surrounded by family and friends, Arturo Vega, the band's artistic director, said.</p> <p>\"He was the guy with a strategy. He was the guy who not only looked after the band's interest, but he also was their defender,\" Mr Vega told the Associated Press. </p> <p>Ramone, whose real name was John Cummings, founded the band with the three other original members - singer Joey Ramone, bassist Dee Dee Ramone and drummer Tommy Ramone - in 1974. </p> <p>They changed their surnames to Ramone when they joined the band, taking the name from Paul McCartney, who sometimes checked into hotels under the pseudonym Paul Ramone at the height of Beatlemania. </p> <p>The Ramones created a punk sound that was characterised by raw, fast, short songs, and influenced a generation of rockers. Their songs included I Wanna Be Sedated, Blitzkrieg Bop, Beat on the Brat and Baby, I Love You. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. </p> <p>Joey Ramone, whose real name was Jeff Hyman, died of lymphatic cancer in 2001. Dee Dee Ramone, whose real name was Douglas Colvin, died of a drug overdose in 2002. Tommy is the only surviving member of the original band. </p> <p>With long black hair and clad in leather jackets, the Ramones began their career in legendary New York clubs such as CBGB and Max's Kansas City, where they performed songs unlike anything else being played at the time. </p> <p>After hearing the band play in London in 1976, future members of the Clash and the Sex Pistols picked up on the sound. </p> <p>Following the release of their debut album in 1976, the Ramones struggled for commercial success but left a formidable imprint on the rock genre, with their sound influencing bands such as Green Day and Nirvana. </p> <p>Bruce Springsteen wrote Hungry Heart for the Ramones after seeing them perform in Asbury Park, New Jersey, but his manager persuaded him to keep the song for himself and it became a hit single. </p> <p>The Ramones worked with big names including the producer Phil Spector, who collaborated with them in 1980. Dee Dee Ramone later said Spector had pulled a gun on the band during the session. </p> <p>\"The Ramones had it rough,\" Vega - who worked with them for 30 years - said. \"The band almost had to be protected from people who were taking advantage of them. There was never any money made.\" </p> <p>Johnny Ramone, however, kept a close watch on the band's budget, with Vega recalling that he would insist they drove non-stop between Boston and New York for shows rather than spending the night in a hotel. </p> <p>In addition to his financial conservatism, the guitarist was politically conservative - the late Ronald Reagan was his favourite president, Vega said. </p> <p>Fans have remained loyal to the Ramones, and the band also showed loyalty to their fans. In 1979, while shooting scenes for the film Rock'n'Roll High School, the Ramones - ignoring the director's orders - played a concert-length session for fans who had paid to be extras. </p> <p>\"The Ramones never ever lost their image, their aura of being the ultimate underdog, the voice of the angry young man,\" Vega said. </p> <p>A tribute concert and cancer research fundraiser was held in Los Angeles on Sunday to mark the band's 30th anniversary. It featured performances from Los Angeles punk band X, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Henry Rollins and others. </p> <p>Along with his wife, Linda Cummings, friends including Pearl Jam rocker Eddie Vedder, singer Rob Zombie, Lisa Marie Presley, Pete Yorn, Vincent Gallo and Talia Shire were gathered at Ramone's bedside yesterday. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and his mother, Estelle Cummings, and will be cremated in a private ceremony.</p>",
  "<p>Alan Milburn aside, the big news of the recent cabinet reshuffle was the elevation of Alan Johnson, until recently minister for higher education and lifelong learning. Apparently, a cabinet seat for work and pensions is the reward for having (just) steered through the top-up fees legislation - and presumably for having shown as little interest in higher education and lifelong learning as possible.</p> <p>Minister for higher education is a strange position. I leave discussion of the lifelong learning (didn't this used to be skills, or maybe training and skills?) aspect to others better qualified. The higher education part of the brief is where I have a closer and more painful knowledge. The part that has served as a public punishment and/or test for recent holders, each one of them holding on for something better to come along. </p> <p>Of course, for some years there has been the anticipated showdown about university funding to keep under control - and ministers for higher education have been appointed to play particular roles in that long-running saga. Until the legislation finally got voted through, and we should remember that there were years of manoeuvring that led up to all that, minister for higher education was a cajoling, coaxing, placating, blustering role - buying time while the sector fell into further decline.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge could barely conceal her displeasure while holding this role, obviously believing the posting to indicate a less than flattering appraisal of her political abilities and status. Unfortunately, this irritation became displaced on to the sector, resulting in fractious relationships all round. </p> <p>Ms Hodge was quietly sidelined when the funding debate started to become too hot and threatening - and has been rewarded for her compliance with the much sexier role of children's minister. So part of being minister for higher education has been about recognising when higher education has passed beyond your limited political domain. But now that we are no longer headlining and are back in the political backwaters of the education pages, it is no longer clear what there is to be managed.</p> <p>Which leads us to Kim Howells, well-known enemy of hip-hop and conceptual art, who has been allocated his stint at higher education - presumably as a chance to think about his behaviour and learn to watch his mouth. After all, how much trouble can there be in higher education, now that the funding bill is done? </p> <p>Mr Johnson appeared to understand the game from the start. He didn't pretend to engage with the sector and made little effort to show knowledge of our concerns. Instead he kept a low profile and focused on the initiation ritual that he had been allocated - to get that vote through. For him, the move to work and pensions is a considerable elevation - a cabinet seat with a weighty department and, in pensions, an all-too-topical and high profile task. </p> <p>If university fees were a headline debate for last year's conference season, then pensions is the hot (too hot) issue for this year. At the TUC conference this week in Brighton, defence of pension rights is the theme that unites and excites delegates. A range of unions contributed to a major debate, all arguing that the threat to pensions is a key concern for all working people, not only pensioners. An emergency motion extends support to workers at Turner and Newall, who are facing the closure of their pension fund. For the labour movement, this issue has become as emotive as job losses, and is met with similar responses of outrage and standing ovations.</p> <p>Despite his exceptionally recent appointment, Mr Johnson replaced Andrew Smith on the TUC platform - and used this opportunity to assure us that, as a former general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, he understands that pension rights are central to trade union concerns. And, to an extent, this worked - he received a warm-ish response, indicated that some of our demands have been included in the forthcoming legislation, and we left feeling that may be we will manage to become friends. All of which, of course, without a word of Mr Johnson's previous post. </p> <p>However much the government pretends that the debate about fees is over, the problem of how to manage lifetime debt and savings is about both pensions and university fees. If we hope to move to majority participation in higher education, then the question of how the debt of university loans will impact on the saving patterns of that large group of people, seeps into the uncertainty of how people can live when they are old. </p> <p>As more and more of the population take part in some form of higher education, this debt burden becomes a problem not only in terms of putting people off education, but also because this form of debt impacts on overall lifetime financial planning. At a time when the government is considering ways of making us all save to avoid poverty when old, and even the TUC is endorsing the idea that people should be compelled to make pension contributions, the question of how much a university education will cost over your lifetime and in relation to other debts such as a mortgage is not one that will go away easily. As the general election approaches, perhaps the sector's issues will be making headlines again.</p>",
  "A former police special branch informer was today sentenced to 22 years in prison for the murder of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. <p>Ken Barrett, 41, pleaded guilty to the killing and 11 other offences at Belfast crown court on Monday. His lawyers are expected to ask for early release under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 accord that has largely brought an end to violence in the province.</p> <p>Barrett was part of the loyalist paramilitary unit that gunned Finucane down in front of his wife and their three children at the family's north Belfast home in February 1989. </p> <p>Sentencing Barrett today, Mr Justice Weir told him he had been involved in a callous and premeditated attack upon a defenceless man.</p> <p>The murder of the solicitor, a 39-year-old Catholic who had successfully represented many top Republicans including the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands, has been at the centre of a 15-year investigation into collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces.</p> <p>Finucane's wife, Geraldine, who was wounded in the shooting, is calling on the British government to hold a full judicial inquiry into his assassination. </p> <p>Investigations by the head of the Metropolitan police, Sir John Stevens, confirmed collusion by the intelligence agencies and police. </p> <p>In his summing up, Mr Justice Weir said: \"I make it clear that this court has no means of assessing the correctness or otherwise of that allegation [of collusion], nor has it any part of its function to do so. </p> <p>\"What is equally clear, however, is that, even if all or part of what you have alleged in that regard were known to be correct, it could in no way mitigate the seriousness of your own admitted actions in the despicable events of that evening.\"</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> John Redwood is back shaping Conservative policy on Europe. I cannot believe the news. He is the only senior Tory who appears to dislike Europe more than Michael Howard. In 1997, Redwood told the Times: \"If we sign the Amsterdam Treaty we will abolish our country.\" Britain survived. Three years later he said: \"The proposed Nice Treaty would do what Guy Fawkes failed to do - blow up parliamentary government in Britain.\" Oh dear. Last time I checked the Commons was still there. Where does Michael Howard turn for advice. He has alienated the Republicans in the US. He has upset Polish communities worldwide with sloppy language about Nazi extermination camps. All the Tory sister parties in Europe are in favour of the new constitutional treaty. Unwelcome in Washingon, unwanted in Warsaw, unpopular on the European right - where can poor Michael find solace? <p><b>\u00b7</b> At the European Movement's AGM in Sheffield I ask Ian Taylor, the pro-EU Tory MP who is standing down as chair of the movement, if I can say something about Michael Howard. He nods. So I simply read what Howard told the Today programme on June 9. Under the constitutional treaty, the Tory leader said, \"Tony Blair would not be at the G8 meeting as prime minister because we would have given up our seat on the G8, we would have given up our seat on the security council of the United Nations\". This is simply untrue. Germany is campaigning for its own seat as a permanent member of the UN security council. No one can imagine President Chirac is about to give up France's UN seat or G8 role. Why is such nonsense disseminated in Britain?</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> At a conference in Italy I share a platform with various social democratic luminaries and with Vaclav Klaus, the president of the Czech Republic; Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, the chancellor of Austria; and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, the former Spanish prime minister. All are key players in the new European right. None have any interest in the rabid anti-Europeanism of today's Tories. It is not that they are uncritical supporters of Brussels - far from it. In a true sense they are all Eurosceptics - applying sceptical reason to what Europe does or does not do, should or should not do. But none of them are proposing to pass national laws - as Michael Howard says he will do over fishing - which would be in breach in the treaties and, if serious, mean the UK quitting the EU. Are there are any Conservatives of the new generation who will speak up against the new isolationism promoted by the Conservatives?</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I listen to distinguished professors in the beautiful Knights Room of the Dutch parliament in the Hague talking about Europe. I ask them to boil down their elegant ideas and postulates in favour of Europe to 15 or 30 seconds - the maximum time one is allowed on television news bulletins to get a point over. None manages. It was a cheap shot on my part perhaps and it is true that Europe is about complexity, cooperation and consensus - none of which lend themselves easily to tabloid headlines and intros. But those of us who reject isolationism and believe that being in the EU is good for Britain have to find words that connect better.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Checking out the websites of the Democratic and Republican party conventions I see that no speaker either Boston or New York mentioned the EU in their speeches. Contrast this with the almost obsessive focus of politicians, journalists, and intellectuals in Europe on the US. Books denouncing the US pile metres high in bookshops in London, Paris, Berlin and Madrid. No one in America knows much about the EU while everyone in Europe is frantic lecturing Americans and each other on what the US should do. Is it not time to cultivate our own garden - and start working out how to make Europe more dynamic and more able to promote its values around the world?</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Smith is the first-rate economics editor of the Sunday Times and not noticeably keen on the EU. But in his latest column he reports on the Washington-based International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector finance arm. Its report, Doing Business in 2005, notes that of the 10 countries that are making life better for new business, seven are EU member states - Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Finland, Poland, Slovakia and Lithuania. In Germany and France, reforms are biting. Companies and unions are cutting working time deals which headed for greater output, growth, profit and jobs. It is still conventional wisdom in London circles to trash Europe's economic performance. But this generalisation may soon require some revision.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In a Commons debate on the new constitutional treaty, several Conservatives call for the treaty to be sent to every citizen. There are about 30 million households in Britain. To send the new EU's new rule-book - about a small paperback in length - would be very expensive. But at least it would put the treaty into everyone's hands and allow people to check the reality of its contents compared to the myths spread by anti-Europeans. In my wind-up speech I ask across the dispatch box if the Conservatives would support spending a serious chunk of taxpayers' money on sending out the text. They all nod in agreement. Every day the anti-European crowd spends container-loads of money on anti-EU propaganda. The Rothermere press alone must be worth several hundred million pounds a year to the EU-haters with its non-stop attacks. Finding the means to put the facts about Europe in front of people is now a priority.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In July, the Guardian published an article I wrote explaining that EU treaties - the existing constitution and the new one - had good language on employment and social rights which did not exist elsewhere in the world. I also pointed out that the new treaty was not going to alter the strike rules and laws, which remained the prerogative of national legislatures and governments. Last month, I wrote an article for Le Monde, drawing largely from my Guardian article and making the same points. The Daily Mail gave me a page lead claiming that I had revealed in Le Monde some dastardly new plot to bring in social legislation from Brussels. It is an old joke that if you want to keep a secret from the press, make a speech in the House of Commons. Now if you want to keep a secret from the Rothermere press you should write an article in the Guardian. But once it appears in French, that mysterious EU language, your ideas will become potent and exciting and be worthy of headlines and lurid language in the Daily Mail!</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Denis MacShane is MP for Rotherham and minister for Europe.</p>",
  "'They say I'm dying. Well, I seem to be taking a very long time to die!\" barked the Reverend Ian Paisley. A gravelly laugh bursts from his throat. \"Do I look unwell?\" He didn't look ill, he looked his age: 78. His thinning white quiff was neatly gelled. His huge hands were perfectly still after a round of bone-crunching handshakes among the stalls of King Billy tea towels and Elvis memorabilia in Bangor market, the jewel in Northern Ireland's \"gold coast\". He loves a good walkabout, he said. It makes him feel young. <p>\"We have the scribes, now where are the Pharisees and the hypocrites?\" he croaked at reporters, before taking off into the crowd of shoppers. \"How are you keeping?\" his voters asked. \"Taking nourishment,\" he boomed back as people queued to shake his hand. He listened to stories of births and deaths, posed for photographs, and autographed an election leaflet for Molly Malcolm, 71, who went home to put it away in a suitcase in her attic with her autographed Paisley rosette from 1959. </p> <p>That was in June. The hardline leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and the hellfire Free Presbyterian church - once famed for his 18-hour days rushing between the European parliament, Westminster and Stormont, then preaching on Belfast street corners, or evangelising in Africa - disappeared from view over the summer amid speculation that he was suffering from prostate cancer or heart disease. </p> <p>In July, he was admitted to hospital for what his family said were scheduled \"routine tests\". Seven days later, the party issued a smiling picture of Paisley back at home with his wife Eileen, whom he calls \"the Boss\". There was no explanation, just a caption saying he was now enjoying his summer break. In a flourish worthy of the Kremlin in the old cold-war days, the party said he was resting in preparation for this week's talks called by Tony Blair at Leeds Castle in Kent to kick-start the peace process. </p> <p>The secrecy around Paisley's health is so guarded that even among the small population of Northern Ireland, where gossip travels fast, nothing has leaked out. No one knows what is wrong with Paisley, whether he is gravely ill or simply facing up to his age. </p> <p>As the whispers mounted, he briefly re-emerged at Stormont a fortnight ago to blame \"Romanists\" in the media for peddling lies about his health. At the weekend it emerged that Paisley's doctors had banned him from flying to the Kent talks, but the Big Man insisted on going, taking the 400-mile scenic route instead by ferry and car. It would help him catch up with his reading, one said. Paisley has a library of 21,000 books. </p> <p>The DUP leader is crucial to the Leeds Castle talks. If the peace process is to move on, devolution must be restored and the DUP must govern alongside Sinn Fein. Paisley is adamant that his party, now the biggest in the province, will not sit down with Sinn Fein before the IRA is wound up. Any agreement must carry Paisley's stamp if it is to be sold to the majority of the unionist people. </p> <p>For 50 years, Paisley was the outsider, the \"Dr No\" who opposed every policy and deal he saw as \"traitorous\", including the Good Friday Agreement. The son of a dissident Baptist preacher, he was born again aged six. He founded his own breakaway church in 1951 and then his own breakaway party in 1971, to defend the Protestant faith and the union with Britain. </p> <p>Now the lifelong outsider leads unionism, having routed the Ulster Unionist establishment in the assembly elections last November. Yet to his detractors Paisley is still a rabble-rouser, a religious bigot whose hostility to Irish republicanism and Roman Catholicism added its own poison to the festering boil that would become 30 years of Troubles. To his voters, he is the \"Big Man\" from Ballymena, God's chosen protector of Ulster. </p> <p>With the rumours about his health comes the plotting. \"Where there's death, there's hope,\" a Northern Ireland office official said of Paisley to the biographer of rival Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble. One view holds that while Paisley dominates unionism, no deal can be made. His party is modernising in its way, goes the argument, and without him it could make a deal with Sinn Fein. Another view holds that Paisley will make a deal fast, so that he can fulfil his ultimate ambition: to be first minister of a devolved assembly, and to finally have the real power he has craved all along. Neither of these views is quite correct, according to his son, Ian Paisley Jr, a DUP assembly member. The truth lies somewhere in between, he says. The man himself won't say; he hasn't cooperated with a national media profile since 1979. </p> <p>Earlier this year, when Paisley announced he was retiring from the European parliament, he told me it was not the beginning of a long goodbye to politics. Over a cup of tea at Stormont, after an operatic rendition of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow by his party's top gospel singers, he said it was the \"beginning of a new beginning\". He had topped every European ballot in Northern Ireland since elections began in 1979. He became the first MEP to speak in the Strasbourg parliament when he protested that the union flag was flying upside down. He had interrupted several Irish leaders in the parliament chamber and was evicted during a speech by the Pope in 1998 when he stood up and shouted: \"I denounce you as the Antichrist!\" But now, he said, he had got the Lord's call to Northern Ireland and would be more \"useful\" leading talks back home. He was cancelling all extra political and church duties to \"fight longer, going further down a harder road\". </p> <p>That day, his new, quieter life began with perching atop a massive motorbike to launch a race sponsored by a new shopping mall. The week before, he had led a picket at Ravenhill rugby ground in Belfast protesting against the Ulster team's first ever Sunday game. This, he said, was \"Sabbath desecration\". (Ulster trounced Leicester and won 33-0. But true to Paisley's warnings that nothing good would come of it, Leicester battered Ulster t he following week.) </p> <p>Roy Garland, a member of the rival Ulster Unionist party who was an associate of Paisley's during the 60s, believes that, above all, he now craves respectability. \"He would like to be seen as a responsible, constructive, almost statesmanlike figure but he hasn't been either responsible or statesmanlike for most of his life,\" he says, referring to Paisley's past which includes setting up short-lived quasi-paramilitary groups, brief spells in jail for breaking the peace and the night in 1981 when he stood on a hillside with 500 unarmed men waving firearms licences. This is the question that lingers: how far was Ian Paisley responsible for the Troubles? How far were people inflamed by his speeches? </p> <p>\"There are no skeletons in his closet,\" his son insists. \"There's nothing in his life which is a secret. The search for the smoking gun is a fruitless search.\" </p> <p>Paisley is clearly dwelling on how history will judge him. Recently he took the unusual step of launching a libel action against the BBC and Max Hastings for comments made about him in a review of the papers. \"I was always a very popular man. If you read the editorials you wouldn't know that,\" he told me at Stormont. Why was he so popular? \"Because I tell the truth,\" he said. </p> <p>Paisley's triumphant, staged appearances since November have sometimes felt like a farewell tour, with renditions of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow at every turn. At this year's party conference, attempting to sum up how much the faithful loved him, the assembly member Sammy Wilson said he could only misquote Lionel Richie and the Commodores. \"You're once, twice, three times a leader, and we love you,\" he declared to raucous applause. Union flags flapped from the audience. Eileen Paisley came on to the stage and her husband announced that she was more beautiful than ever, even if she bossed him around and he sometimes had to go out to the garage for a bit of peace. \"The family that prays together stays together,\" he said. </p> <p>The large clock above the entrance to Paisley's Belfast headquarters, the cavernous Martyrs' Memorial church, announces \"Time is short.\" (He also collects old watches and clocks.) At one Sunday service I attended at the start of the year, in the run-up to the review of the Good Friday Agreement and the workings of the Stormont assembly, he instructed his congregation to pray so that the enemies of Ulster might be confounded. There was a rota to sign for a round-the-clock prayer vigil. Be speedy, he warned, or you'll get the 5am slot. </p> <p>As Paisley, his voice weaker but still booming, said from the pulpit that he would defend his people to the hilt at the review, one man at the back roared \"amen\" in approval as if it was a political rally. I was the only woman in the congregation not wearing a hat. From the pulpit, Paisley ordered a prayer for the newcomer. But the church, with pews for 1,450 people, was only around 25% full. Other fire- and-brimstone preachers draw the crowds that Paisley used to. Religion is a cut-throat business in Belfast, the last buckle in the Bible-belt. </p> <p>There is speculation that he could step down from his Westminster seat at the next election, handing over to his son. But Ian Paisley Jr is troubled by the morbid gossip. \"If it was true that my father was dying, he would be the first to say to the public: 'By the way this is happening to me, you have the right to know as I have always told you what's happening to me.'\" </p> <p>Nor, he insists, should we expect a \"death-bed\" compromise. \"Most of all, he doesn't want his legacy to be a bad deal. He wants to do the right deal with the right people at the right time. He doesn't want a settlement with Republicans, he wants a victory for peace.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>SIG</strong>, Britain's leading distributor of insulation products, may not be the most exciting company on the stock market but its shareholders are not complaining. </p> <p>Its share price has more than doubled in the past 18 months as the group has found itself one of the main beneficiaries of new legislation on thermal and sound emissions. It was on the move again yesterday, closing 7.5p stronger at a record 452.75p after Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and set a 510p target price. </p> <p>City professionals reckon that was not the only factor driving the shares higher, though. They believe Saint-Gobain, Europe's leading building materials group, is running the slide rule over the company. </p> <p>Despite its recent strong run many analysts, including Mark Hake at Merrill Lynch, reckon SIG is still cheap, given the regulatory environment in Europe. </p> <p>Indeed, its shares at present are at a discount to its peers in the construction and building materials sector. </p> <p>On top of that, traders note that Saint-Gobain returned to the acquisition trail early this year with the purchase of Dahl International, Scandinavia's biggest plumbing product distributor. </p> <p>In the wider market, leading shares surrendered early gains to close little changed. Having raced to 4,575 points - its highest level since April 28 - the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> index fell back to finish a mere 2.8 points higher at 4,548.4 as Wall Street opened lower after a profits warning from Coca-Cola and the Nasdaq came under pressure from Goldman Sachs downgrading its rating on the computer software and hardware sectors. </p> <p><strong>Abbey National</strong>, down 37.5p at 572.5p, was the biggest blue-chip faller after <strong>HBOS</strong>, up 23.5p at 738p, announced it would not be making an offer for the former building society. </p> <p>It was closely followed by <strong>Scottish &amp; Newcastle</strong>, 14.25p lighter at 384p, and <strong>Diageo</strong>, 20p lower at 687.5p, as both traded ex-dividend - or without entitlement to their latest dividend payment. </p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 250</strong> index shed 1.2 points to 6,250.2, and the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index was off just 1.3 points at 2,562.7. In the bond market, gilts closed lower. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed around 100.65, yielding 4.917%. </p> <p><strong>Cadbury Schweppes</strong> was one of the day's main talking points. Its shares fell 9p to 441p, unsettled by the Coke profit alert. Cadbury is competitor to Coke through its Dr Pepper and 7-Up brands. The Coke warning also upset can maker <strong>Rexam</strong>, 2p weaker at 416.5p. </p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> advanced 16p to \u00a313.98 after the top-rated mining team at blue-chip broker Cazenove upgraded the shares. \"We feel Rio Tinto's underperformance relative to the rest of the sector is coming to an end,\" Cazenove said, predicting a substantial increase in earnings this year. </p> <p>\"Rio has good exposure to commodities [iron ore and copper] which would appear set for the best pricing momentum in 2005.\" </p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Capital Radio</strong> was one of the best FTSE 250 performers. Its shares gained 20p to 420p but traders were divided over the reason for the rise. Some attributed the strong performance to talk of a merger deal with Classic FM owner <strong>GWR</strong> , which advanced 4.25p to 255p. More sober market watchers reckoned the cause lay with with an upgrade from the media team at stockbroker Panmure. </p> <p>Shifting its recommendation to buy, Panmure said it was time to tune in to Capital shares, which have underperformed the media sector by 8% since the publication of disappointing audience figures at the end of July. </p> <p>\"At this level the stock now offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.6% which is well supported by a strong balance sheet. Furthermore, we believe downside is limited as it is likely to fuel further takeover speculation,\" Panmure said. </p> <p>Heading the other way was alternative telecoms company <strong>Thus</strong>, which fell 1p to 16p after a big shareholder dumped 32m shares - or 2.3% of the company - at 15p. </p> <p>There was also a late trade in serviced office group <strong>Regus</strong>. It closed unchanged at 66.75p. A line of 23.2m shares - about 2% of the company - went through the ticker at that price after the market closed. </p> <p>Among the smaller firms, renewed talk of a bid from the US helped <strong>Chemring</strong>, the airborne countermeasures specialist, improve 2p to 392.5p. </p> <p>On Aim, <strong>International Brand Licensing</strong>, the Admiral sportswear company, was unmoved at 31p despite concerns that the 9.5% stake held by chairman Lance Yates, who died at the weekend, might soon be sold. </p> <p>Talk of tough trading left <strong>Sky Capital</strong>, the mini-investment bank with offices in London and New York, 22.5p lower at 171p, while property group <strong>Your Space</strong> marked time at 2p as traders took a second look at Tuesday's full-year figures. Buried in the results statement was news that the firm had received a number of approaches from other companies, which it is actively pursuing. </p> <p><strong>Pursuit Dynamics</strong>, the pumps specialist, improved 6p to 148.5p on rumours of a deal with the Campbell Soup Company.</p>",
  "<p>A convicted paedophile was hired as a driver for vulnerable children by the council condemned for failing to protect murdered child abuse victim Victoria Climbi\u00e9, it has emerged.</p> <p>Sex offender Dennis Bell was employed by the London borough of Haringey as a minibus driver for children with learning difficulties without any police checks.</p> <p>The council only discovered he had at least nine convictions for sex offences when the 53-year-old from east London was stopped by the police for motoring offences. </p> <p>Bell was sacked and a child protection investigation was carried out to see whether any children had been harmed. It found no evidence that abuse had taken place.</p> <p>The council has laid the blame for Bell's appointment with the agency that recruited him two years ago. It said the company failed to check his background through the criminal records bureau (CRB). But the council failed to check that the CRB vetting procedures had been carried out.</p> <p>A Haringey council spokeswoman said: \"Dennis Bell was employed in 2002 by an agency that provided drivers periodically to the council. As with any supplier who is providing staff to work with children or vulnerable adults the agency was required to carry out the necessary CRB checks before they start work. Regretfully, in this incident the agency failed to carry out the necessary checks and we terminated our transport contract with it as a result.\"</p> <p>She added that the council now insisted that recruitment agencies provided documentary evidence that CRB checks had been carried out on staff.</p> <p>She added that an investigation by the police, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and social services had not uncovered any evidence that child abuse had taken place. </p> <p>The scandal follows revelations last week that the council's social services department had employed 18 convicted criminals over the past three years, and just months after the inquiry into the vetting failures that allowed Soham murderer Ian Huntley to work as a school caretaker despite a string of allegations of underage sex with girls. </p> <p>The report by Sir Michael Bichard warned that he \"could not be confident\" that the failures to vet Huntley were a one off.</p>",
  "<p> <strong> What can digital audio broadcasting (DAB) give us that analogue radio can't?</strong> </p> <p>We're marketing it as a \"lifestyle\" product so we're not aiming it at computer geeks, because they make up about 1% of the market. The main thing DAB does is that all the stations are there for you - you turn it on and it auto-tunes all the stations and puts them in alphabetical order. It saves you having to remember frequencies. The DAB computer inside the radio then allows the broadcaster to give you text information that scrolls along the display. At the moment, it's still quite simple, but that's because new technology for most people is a scary prospect. DAB can do a huge amount but why make it more complicated until people understand it? So, for now, the broadcasters restrict information to things such as the weather and who's going to win Big Brother. </p> <p><strong> Do you see DAB evolving to bring us more information? </strong> </p> <p>It has to dramatically increase in market penetration first. Prices have to come down. There's a huge amount of things you can do currently - for example, the electronic programming guide you get with Sky Digital could be done on a DAB radio but it would cost \u00a3300. That's not mass market. Features such as clickable listings and movable pictures of favourite bands will be possible. People have been talking about being able to pause and rewind live radio but you can only rewind your radio five minutes without having to put a special card into it. People just want to turn their radios on and listen to Britney or whoever, they don't want to mess around with memory cards. </p> <p><strong> Has broadband played a big part in the renaissance of radio? </strong> </p> <p>The \"always on\" connection of broadband has made a big difference. Because we're a technology company I've had broadband, and previously ISDN, for around six years. You don't have to wait for anything any more. I'm pretty hopeless technically so I just expect it to be on and working. </p> <p><strong> Will spammers be able to infiltrate DAB? </strong></p> <p> It is conceivably possible for companies to advertise through your radio but broadcasters would be in control of that. If broadcasters think people are switching off because of what they're putting down that DLS (Dynamic Label Segment), then they're not going to do it. I think DAB has regulated things hugely. If you look at the FM spectrum, there's no more space for minority radio stations so, for example, DAB can let you have Panjab Radio (<strong> &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.panjabradio.co.uk\"</strong>\"&gt;www.panjabradio.co.uk ), which can specifically target its audience. So, far from it being a spam-medium, I think it might actually be a better-targeted advertising medium. </p> <p><strong> Gadgets? </strong></p> <p> I'm really keen to get a <a href=\"http://www.blackberry.com\">BlackBerry</a> as it is GPRS, so it'll work on a beach in Lanzarote.

  "<p><strong> Beware of unpaid council tax</strong><br> </p> <p>Londoner Anne Tillyer was getting on blamelessly with her life when suddenly, last March, she was surprised by a letter from Lambeth Council demanding \u00a33,000 in council tax on a property she had left six years previously. Moreover, the bill covered the four years between 1996 and 2000 despite the fact that Tillyer had rented the flat (along with three others) only until 1998. Most gallingly of all, the official letter demanded a response within seven days although, as Tillyer pointed out, it had taken the council six years to get around to raising the matter. </p> <p>She immediately launched into patient correspondence with the shadowy figures who were pursuing her (signatures on the end of official letters were illegible squiggles and none of her missives was replied to) and sent proof that she had moved out of the flat in 1998, but to no avail. Menaces from bailiffs began to thud through her letterbox and she has now discovered that her case has been passed to a firm of solicitors, which is in the process of declaring her bankrupt. Tillyer claims that no council tax bills arrived when she was living at the address (she assumed her rent covered her dues) and that, if payments are due, she should be liable for only a quarter of the sum since she was one of four tenants. \"Somebody somewhere is making decisions about me and not listening to any of my appeals,\" she says. \"It would be a miracle if someone would just agree to talk to me.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The council makes sorrowful noises but insists that Tillyer must pay up. When council tax on a property is owed by more than one person, the full debt is is owned \"jointly and severally\" - in other words, any of the individuals can be pursued for the full amount and the council cannot bill each for his or her portion of it. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Tillyer, Lambeth has not been able to trace any of her former flatmates and is therefore demanding the arrears from her alone. The only good news is that the council now accepts that she moved out in 1998, even though it was not notified of new tenants until 2000, so the bill has dropped to \u00a31,900. Also it has decided to defer its demands for a month, which will entitle her to a further three months grace before legal action is begun. It is all very unfair, but legal, and the moral of the tale is to make sure you notify the relevant authorities when you move to or from an address and check at the beginning of each tenancy what bills are to be paid by whom.</p> <p><strong> A booking error is no case for a Ryanair refund</strong><br> </p> <p>Ryanair prides itself on being a no-frills airline, frills being, if letters to this column are a gauge, things such as wheelchairs to ferry disabled passengers across the Tarmac, the safe arrival of luggage and refunds if the company's bookings system slips up. Robert Woodward toiled through the process of booking two tickets on its website but, as he neared the end of the transaction, a message popped up informing him that, while he was online, all the seats on that flight had been taken. So he bought tickets to a different airport, only to find confirmation that both transactions had gone through and fares for both journeys had been debited from his card. </p> <p>Ryanair refused to countenance a refund for the first booking, claiming that Woodward should have checked that the reservation had not been accepted, despite the notification that the flight was fully booked. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The airline insists that it only offers refunds in the case of duplicate bookings where identical travel dates and routes indicate a genuine booking error. Moreover, it says, there were no IT problems with its website on the day Woodward's transaction was aborted and, since seats are still available on the flight he originally requested, it can't account for the message that deterred him. However, Consumer has softened that hard corporate heart just a little and Ryanair is now prepared to offer him a credit note to the value of the first booking, although he will have to make use of it within six months.</p> <p><strong> New cars can come with out-of-date warranties</strong><br> </p> <p> Last month I reported the sorry tale of a Volkswagen owner who could not tell whether the stress fracture on his windscreen was covered by warranty because the dealer would not let him see a copy. The document, he was told, ran to too many pages so he would have to let the mechanics decide whether or not to repair it for free. </p> <p>That has prompted Les Hankin of Cheadle, Cheshire, to lament his fate at the hands of VW. He was refused free repairs to his new car because, he learned, its two-year warranty had begun ticking on the date the vehicle was imported, not when he purchased it from the dealer. \"The VW warranty people told me that many people are caught out by this, and as the fact does not appear on any literature, it strikes me as invidious.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> All drivers beware. Warranties do indeed begin on the day the vehicle is first registered, which is to say the day it is first sold in its country of origin. This means, of course, that by the time you get your hands on your brand new hatchback its guarantees could be about to expire. VW admits that it does not publish warranty periods for all countries outside the UK, but says that the information should be passed on by the importer.</p> <p><strong> Antler holds the key to good customer service</strong><br> </p> <p> It is always delightful to report companies that do not put profit before all things. When Len Smith mislaid both keys to his aged Antler travel bag, he emailed the company to find out whether it would be possible to buy replacements. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> He received a reply the same day telling him how to find out what range the bag was and promising to send a new lock and key. Two days after that, two new padlocks and two keys arrived along with an invoice for \u00a300.00. \"That,\" says Smith, \"is what I call real customer service.\" </p> <p>Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It is Saturday afternoon in Deauville and George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola are sitting in a hotel suite, pondering just what might have happened 35 years ago if THX 1138 - Lucas's first film as a director, made when he was only 25 - had been a success. Coppola is a little hungover. Lucas is sitting with his arms folded, looking thoughtful. </p> <p>The top brass at Warner Brothers were utterly bewildered by THX when they saw it in 1970. They were hoping for a sci-fi Easy Rider. What they got was an oblique, if beautifully made, experimental drama about totalitarianism and unbridled consumerism in the vein of Chris Marker's La Jet\u00e9e or Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville. They demanded re-cuts from Lucas (\"Put the freaks up front\" was their motto) and promptly withdrew their financing from American Zoetrope, the San Francisco-based film-making collective presided over by Coppola that had made the movie. </p> <p>\"I feel no bitterness whatsoever,\" Coppola says when asked about the decision to close down Zoetrope just when it was shaping up to become a counter-culture answer to United Artists - an outfit where visionary film-makers made personal movies without interference. \"Warner Bros lost more than I did in a way. Through the Zoetrope connection, they had the opportunity to work with all of those film-makers who would have been loyal to them.\" </p> <p>Zoetrope was indeed impressive. Along with Lucas and Coppola, it also provided a home to such combustible talents as John Milius, Carroll Ballard and Caleb Deschanel. Its collapse had unforeseen consequences. A few months after THX, Coppola (in desperate need of money) accepted a job at Paramount directing a film called The Godfather. Lucas briefly contemplated quitting but instead took a more commercial tack, making American Graffiti and Star Wars. </p> <p>\"Lo and behold, it opened up other avenues and opportunities for me. I thought I would try at least once before my career ended to make a traditional studio film with sets and shooting on sound stage - and that's what has led me to where I am now.\" </p> <p>The irony is self-evident: if Warner Bros had been more enthusiastic about THX, none of this would have happened. We might now be living in a world without Luke Skywalker or Don Corleone (at least as envisioned by Coppola). Warner Bros is belatedly making amends. The studio has paid for the restoration of THX, a painstaking process that took Lucas two years. (\"It cost more to restore the film than it did to make it,\" he says.) </p> <p>We're so accustomed to the idea of Lucas as Hollywood mogul that it comes as a surprise to discover that he still regards himself as the experimental film-maker battling against a system that wants to crush him. His original plan, when he enrolled at University of Southern California, was to \"become a documentary film-maker and make avant-garde films on the side\". </p> <p>THX began as a 15-minute student project, Electronic Labyrinth THX1138 - 4EB (1967). It was the story of a brave new world in which the citizens are sedated by mind-soothing drugs. Sex is forbidden and children are conceived artificially. \"There is no evil in THX. Evil doesn't exist,\" says Lucas. \"Everybody is nice. Everything is wonderful ... but immediately you sense this is not the place you want to live.\" </p> <p>The actors have shaven heads, which make them look like concentration camp inmates. They dress in white. Much of the film is set against bleached white backdrops. When we see prisoners cowering at the feet of cops wielding huge electrified batons, it's hard not to think of the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison. </p> <p>What makes THX so unsettling is its ambiguity. The film could be read as a cold war satire about Soviet-style totalitarianism, were it not for the fact that western consumerism dominates the world that THX (Robert Duvall) rebels against after beginning an illicit affair with LUH (Maggie McOmie). </p> <p>Lucas (who describes the film as a \"parable of 1970\") acknowledges that THX was a direct reaction to the Vietnam war. \"You lived with it. You couldn't avoid it. A lot of us had gone through the problems of being subject to the draft, which is pretty totalitarian - if you don't want to do something and the government makes you, that's pretty strong stuff. That was the environment in which THX and Star Wars were made.\" </p> <p>On one level, the film is autobiographical, too. It's Lucas's version of Fellini's I Vitelloni, a story about someone prepared to escape his stifling, claustrophobic background. \"I was always very conscious that I left my home town [Modesto], went to film school against everybody's advice and followed my instincts,\" Lucas says. </p> <p>For Coppola, the film's attack on consumerism is even more relevant now than it was in 1970. \"There are things in the film that are even more accurate today as commercials and advertising bombard us to make us feel inadequate so we will buy things.\" </p> <p>Isn't there an irony in the director of the Star Wars trilogy and the founder of LucasArtsLicencing, which earned a fortune from merchandising, lecturing us on the perils of consumerism? \"Well, probably,\" Lucas cheerily replies. According to him, all those Darth Vader toys weren't just about making money but about sparking children's imaginations. \"Toys give children the chance to extend the experience from the movie theatre into reality. They could take those toys, play and tell different stories. They could build fantasy worlds.\" </p> <p>Even now, Coppola and Lucas still seem to see themselves as outsiders in Hollywood. Coppola, who is old enough to remember working with Jack Warner, sees Heaven's Gate (the film that bankrupted United Artists) as the moment when the barbarians took over. All of a sudden, directors had to answer to a small army of studio executives who had an opinion about every aspect of any given movie, from cast right down to design. Lucas calls this \"the Thalberg syndrome\" after Irving Thalberg, the legendary but highly manipulative \"Boy Wonder\" who pulled the strings at MGM in the 1930s. </p> <p>Since Hollywood has been taken over by the \"middle managers\", as he witheringly calls them, Lucas argues that the studios have been \"making hugely inefficient movies for great amounts of money and they aren't creatively very interesting. Any studio you go to, you're going to find 30 executives working on your picture.\" </p> <p>When Coppola bemoans the trend for sequels, Lucas chimes in with \"That's even worse!\", seemingly oblivious to the fact that he has made half a dozen Star Wars films himself. He sees Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as one of the few film-makers who has escaped its manacles. \"When you're in New Zealand, it's hard for them to get you.\" </p> <p>To outsiders, it has long seemed that Lucas has carte blanche to do whatever he wants. If that is the case, he insists it is only because he fought so hard. \"It started out with Francis giving me that freedom [on THX]. I got successful enough so that I could do it myself. Now I have reached a point where I've got enough money and can do whatever I want, whether it's right, wrong or indifferent. It's my money that's at stake.\" He is now going to return to his roots and make more films in the vein of THX. Whether they make money or not doesn't worry him. </p> <p>THX is the one George Lucas movie that has drifted close to obscurity - he wants to rescue it for a new generation that knows him only through Star Wars. To accompany the DVD release, Warners has paid for a new documentary about American Zoetrope. \"It's the first time we film-makers have had a chance to talk about it. A lot of what has been written has been completely false. It's rumours and innuendos and gossip - but it was a noble experiment.\" </p> <p>You can't help but sense a feeling of nostalgia in Lucas for that heady period in late-1960s San Francisco when he was part of a radical filmmaking movement. As the film's sound editor and co-writer Walter Murch remarks: \"Star Wars is a big burden he'll be happy to leave behind. Fate is kind - and fickle. In an ideal world, real film-makers would have enough success with one movie to then make another. But it doesn't work out that way. Either you make a film that's a complete failure - or it's so successful that it distorts everything that comes after it.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Director's Cut THX 1138 is out now.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: The papers speculate about Bragg's Blair comments, five stranded sailors come ashore, confusion reigns over Holyrood findings.</p> <p> <b>BREAKING NEWS</b><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1305742,00.html\"> Briton 'kidnapped in Baghdad'</a></p> <p> <b>HOLES FOUND IN TIGHTS SECURITY</b></p> <p> It's been quite a week for men in tights. Following Batman's foray into the Palace, it's the Commons' costumed guards who are under scrutiny, as the Times warns that \"the scenes of the men in frock coats chasing the men in T-shirts across the floor of the Commons chamber yesterday sounded the death knell for an antiquated security system\".</p> <p>The Guardian's leader calls the invasion of the floor of the Commons by five pro-hunt protesters \"a desecration of the basic principles of democracy and law and it was absolutely beyond excuse\". But, for the Telegraph, it shows \"that the patience of some of the most law-abiding people in the land cannot be taken for granted in the face of very bad laws\". And this view of an \"explosion of rage by those who wouldn't normally dream of breaking the law\" (the Mail) is echoed in the Times' leader, which ruefully warns that \"yesterday's theatrics in and around parliament will reflect worst on a government which has risked social and constitutional strife to mollify its base with an unnecessary law\".</p> <p>The question of how protesters managed to evade the Commons' security, however antiquated, for the first time in living memory is tackled at length by the Telegraph, which reports, among the tales of hard hats and forged letters, that \"there were unconfirmed reports that the security card of a Tory MP's researcher was used to access parts of the building\". The Guardian reports that the BBC had been warned of the protesters' plans and that they \"had undertaken a dry run on Tuesday, dressing up as builders\".</p> <p>However, as Simon Hoggart writes in the Guardian, \"in spite of having crafted brilliant and successful plans to get past the security system, they hadn't quite worked out what to say. One of them merely shouted: \"it's totally unjust!\"</p> <p>And so to the protesters outside the Commons. Pictures of bloodied demonstrators abound, but only the Mirror can headline them: \"Now they know how the fox feels\". In the Telegraph, Charles Moore gets quite pink in the face and waxes almost DH Lawrence in his enjoyment of the countryside's \"poor\" from \"wild Wales\" on display: \"Some had shaven heads and tattoos and rough tongues ... Many, too, were young. Beautiful girls shinned up lampposts and revealed more and more of themselves to the Mother of Parliaments. One wore a policeman's cap at a rakish angle. Beardless boys blew horns.\" </p> <p>The Mail is more concerned with the \"celebrity count\" among the protesters, devoting a double-page spread to the \"star's son and the royal chum\" - Bryan Ferry's son, Otis, and England polo player Luke Tomlinson. A friend of the royals, according to the Mail, when he's not storming the Houses of Parliament, Mr Tomlinson \"drinks only rarely, is careful with his diet and, during the polo season, claims to enjoy the social life of a monk\". So that's OK then. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/hunt/Story/0,2763,1305667,00.html\">Invasion of the Commons</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/hunt/Story/0,2763,1305680,00.html\">Out bounds\"</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/hunt/Story/0,2763,1305686,00.html\">Crack team of tailcoats to the rescue</a><br>* <a href=\"http://search.thetimes.co.uk/cgi-bin/ezk2srch?-aSTART#\">Times: A mockery of Commons security</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,542-1264448,00.html\">Times: A hollow victory</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/16/dl1601.xml\">Telegraph: Arrogant indifference to our liberties</a></p> <p> <b>NOTHING TO BRAGG ABOUT</b></p> <p> \"Lord Bragg was at home with his hairstyle yesterday and feeling like a man who has inadvertently shot a good friend in the back\" muses the Guardian as the papers continue to speculate on Blair's springtime wobble. According to the Guardian, Bragg's comments that Blair had been close to quitting earlier this year were \"accidental, not intended\". </p> <p>The Independent reports on the fightback by Blair's allies, quoting John Reid's revealing comment that \"the prime minister is human like anyone else\". Really? The Times, despite promising in its standfirst to \"unpick the tangled web of hype, truth and speculation that surround a personal nadir for the prime minister\", merely hints at a \"family trauma\" over Easter that \"has been the subject of whispered rumours\" and resorts to the disappointing comment that \"the truth is that nobody knows exactly what was in Mr Blair's mind during this period\". We are firmly told, however, that \"Mr Brown is yet again angry and despondent\". </p> <p>On the day of the launch of Cherie Blair's book on prime minister's wives, Fiona Millar, who worked with Britain's first lady for eight years, offers her perspective on the matter, \"as a minnow in the goldfish bowl\", in G2.

Stories with a happy ending haven't exactly been thick on the ground recently, so the tale of the five sailors rescued after managing to make a 999 call using the one bar of battery left on their mobile phone gets splashed in all the papers. </p> <p>The Express highlights their perilous situation with part of the transcript of the emergency call made by one of the group: \"I'm phoning from a life raft. We've sunk our boat and we're basically drifting, we've been drifting for the last eight days. We need a rescue.\" The paper includes the alarming information that \"they were forced to fill bottles with their urine which they were preparing to drink\". </p> <p>The Telegraph offers a snapshot of the gung-ho spirit which kept the team going as they shared their last Mars bar: \"We all stuck together. It was team endurance. We laughed and carried each other forward.\" It's down to the Mail to inject a note of bitterness into this unusually agreeable coverage: \"At one point the crew thought rescue was at hand when a fishing boat passed 400 yards away. But it turned and sailed off despite two flares from the raft. 'I really hope I meet that man one day,' said David. 'There's no way he didn't see us.'\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,1305437,00.html\">Crew of 5 rescued after week in life raft</a></p> <p><b>HOLYROOD ENDING</b></p> <p> There seems to be some confusion over Lord Fraser's report into the delayed and catastrophically over-budget Scottish parliament building. According to the Independent's headline, the \"Report into Holyrood fiasco blames no one\". The Telegraph sees it differently, branding its story \"Civil servants take the blame for spiralling cost of Holyrood\" and saying that \"the civil service bore the brunt of Lord Fraser's criticisms for witholding crucial information from politicians\". The Guardian veers more towards the Indy's perspective - \"'No single villain' in Holyrood fiasco\" - but reports that the first minister, Jack McConnell \"has promised to create a more effective and specialised civil service in light of Lord Fraser's report\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1305473,00.html\">'No single villain' in Holyrood scandal</a><br>* <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=562196\">Independent: Report into Holyrood fiasco blames no one</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/16/nholy16.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/09/16/ixportal.html\">Telegraph: Civil servants blamed for cost of Holyrood</a></p> <p><b>RUUD BUOYED</b></p> <p> \"He's made Nistory\" shouts the Sun as it celebrates \"record-breaker Ruud\", Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who scored a dramatic Champions League double in the space of five minutes for Manchester United against Lyon. \"Sir Alex Ferguson's players had been losing by two goals and seemed devoid of ideas until Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs swapped flanks in the second half and Van Nistelrooy began to shimmer with menace,\" reports Daniel Taylor in the Guardian, adding that the Dutch player \"could hardly have done more to justify his status as first-choice striker\".

  "<p> Today the first <a href=\"http://www.gamesforhealth.org/events.html\">Games for Health Conference</a> kicks off in Madison, Wisconsin, entertaining at least 100 delegates on the use of computer gaming in health education and healthcare.</p> <p>This comes in a timely fashion, days after <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/entry/8166275538540474/\">Joystiq</a> reported a a survey of 2,100 parents and teachers which found that playing Pokemon helps children learn \"important values and skills\", including hand-eye coordination, social interaction and lateral thinking.</p> <p> Before you make jibes about pick-ups or re-spawning, head to conference organisers <a href=\"http://www.seriousgames.org \">Serious Games</a> to see what kinds of positive things can come from interactive entertainment. Highlights include dealing with phobias with off-the-shelf gaming entertainment, developing biofeedback systems with gaming technologies, <a href=\"http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/issue173/np.shtml\">GlucoBoy</a>, a Game Boy-based product to encourage kids with diabetes to control their blood sugar and a presentation by Dr. James Rosser, the sugeon who's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/07/health/main610601.shtml\">study</a> at the Beth Israel Medical Center in New York suggested that daily gameplay (on <a href=\"http://www.sega.com/games/game_temp.php?game=supermonkeyball\">Super Monkey Ball</a> in this instance) has a positive effect on the ability to perform keyhole surgery. </p> <p>While conferences like this one are fantastic and emphasise the breadth of goodness that can come from gaming, one niggling concern with suggesting that people can learn positive things from the PlayStation is that \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 some might use this information as an excuse to extrapolate a counter-argument.

  "<p>British Airways is to cancel almost 1,000 flights from Heathrow during the next few months in an effort to improve its operational performance, it was learned yesterday. Short- and long-haul destinations will be affected, including flights to New York, Brussels, Manchester and Glasgow. </p> <p>BA said 966 flights would be cancelled in the next three months, an average of 12 a day, out of a total of 41,000. </p> <p>A spokesman said it was part of a plan to have a \"robust\" programme and to build some slack into the flight programme. </p> <p>Union leaders claimed that the airline was still short of check-in staff at Heathrow, a problem which had led to flight cancellations and delays for travellers in the summer. BA said it was recruiting staff into areas such as check-in desks. </p> <p>The company said there would be some reductions on a small number of routes which had a large number of daily flights from Heathrow. </p> <p>The cancellations would relieve pressure on BA's programme and allow the airline to provide customers with a more robust flight schedule for the rest of the year, it said. BA stressed that the cancellations represented a tiny percentage of its flying operation at Heathrow.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has been accused of being \"an arrogant, self satisfied organisation\" by MPs on a parliamentary committee charged with looking at its finances. </p> <p>The first ever grilling of the BBC by the public affairs committee, an arrangement brokered under a compromise agreement between the corporation and the committee during the run-up to last year's Communications Act, degenerated yesterday into a condemnation of the corporation's attitude to external regulation. </p> <p>The meeting was ostensibly to question the BBC director general, Mark Thompson, and BBC governor Dermot Gleeson over a National Audit Office report into the corporation's development of Freeview, the first such report made under the compromise that allowed the NAO limited scrutiny of BBC finances. </p> <p>But the majority of the MPs on the committee took the opportunity to criticise the BBC for refusing to allow its finances to be scrutinised fully by the NAO and the committee. </p> <p>\"We're talking about the monitoring of a rather arrogant, self-satisfied organisation to see how it spends our constituents' money,\" said Labour MP Alan Williams. </p> <p>Under the compromise agreement brokered by the BBC's director of legal and policy Caroline Thomson in the run-up to the Communications Act, the corporation provides a list of topics that it would like the NAO to look into. </p> <p>But the MPs made it clear they saw the existing arrangement as purely temporary until they can make the BBC fully financially accountable to the NAO. </p> <p>\"If a government department can be answerable to a committee, even the defence services, without that in any way being challenging to its independence, why on earth should it be damaging to the BBC if the NAO chooses what it wants to investigate rather than doing it from a list,\" said Mr Williams. </p> <p>And when Ms Thomson, who also faced the panel of MPs alongside director of strategy Carolyn Fairbairn, tried to argue that it would be \"unfortunate\" if the first session was taken up with going over old ground, she was shot down by committee chairman Edward Leigh. \"These questions are perfectly reasonable,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Nothing you've said to us indicates any evidence that looking into the way you spend money would prejudice the editorial independence of your organisation,\" he added. </p> <p>Mr Gleeson argued that the BBC had entered into the current system \"in good faith\". \"Commissioning the NAO to produce value for money reports fits in very well with governor's new agenda,\" he said. </p> <p>But he argued that if the NAO was to be given complete control over the corporation's finances it would compromise its editorial independence. </p> <p>For example, if the NAO started looking into the way that the BBC funded its overseas news bureaux it would be impossible to do so without making decisions that would affect editorial, he argued. </p> <p>\"The idea that there is no accountability seems preposterous to me,\" added Mr Thompson. The BBC also argued that in addition to the NAO's investigations, the governors were also carrying out value for money audits on the full range of the corporation's activities, using both internal and external auditors. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<b>Hunting banned</b> <br>A ban on hunting with hounds was overwhelmingly backed by MPs, after pro-hunt protesters stormed the Commons in an unprecedented breach of security. <p>The hunting bill was given a second reading by 356 votes to 166, to cheers in the crowded chamber, which had been invaded earlier by five protesters. Doorkeepers quickly grabbed the intruders and bundled them out but not before they were able to get right up to the dispatch box, shouting and gesturing at the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael. </p> <p>The Speaker, Michael Martin, later said eight pro-hunt protesters used a forged letter to get into the building. He told MPs the men had probably been assisted by a passholder \"exceeding\" their authority. It was a \"carefully planned operation\" and the Serjeant-at-Arms had asked police to conduct a full investigation. Extra police would be on duty for tomorrow's sitting and all security staff leave had been cancelled. </p> <p>During debate on the bill, Mr Michael said: \"I still hope that peers will engage with the hunting bill this time around. If they fail to do so the only way in which the matter can be properly resolved at this stage is for the will of this house to prevail under the provision of the Parliament Act.\" </p> <p>Tory spokesman James Gray said his party, if elected, would use government time and a free vote to attempt to repeal a ban. </p> <p>Later, the compromise move, to delay the fox-hunting ban to July 2006 was backed by 342 votes to 15. Mr Michael said the 18-month delay would \"would have the advantage of ensuring that the ban comes into force before the start of the main 2006/2007 hunting season\". </p> <p> Labour's Phil Sawford accused pro-hunt supporters of trying to \"terrorise\" his family. He said: \"I was concerned to learn this morning that people carrying masks were outside my home last night in a vehicle which apparently contained some sacks of manure. \"Their intent was perhaps some kind of illegal or criminal act around my home. But apparently they saw some police cars and left.\" </p> <p><b>Prime minister's questions</b><br> The Tory leader, Michael Howard, accused the prime minister of failing to get to grips with the problems people really care about by making it a priority to ban fox-hunting. He said that under Labour crime had increased, incapacity benefit was \"out of control\", tax was rising and there was a pensions \"crisis\" and demanded: \"When are you going to get to grips with the problems people really care about?\" </p> <p>Mr Blair defended the government's record, insisting the economy was \"strong,\" with record levels of employment, low interest and inflation rates and rising living standards. \"The truth is this country is stronger, fairer and more prosperous than it was seven years ago and I believe that is one reason why people reject the Conservatives.\" </p> <p> <b>Nuclear power</b><br> Public safety fears and high costs would have to be overcome before there was any chance of building any new nuclear power stations, the prime minister said. He told MPs the government had not \"shut the door\" on nuclear but there was \"simply not the consent\" for it to expand as things stood. Renewable energy sources would play a \"vital part\" in reducing greenhouse gases. </p> <p><b>Gurkhas</b><br>A decision on whether former Gurkhas can be granted UK citizenship when they leave the British Army will be taken \"within the next few weeks\", Mr Blair said. He told the Commons they had a strong case but concerns over the possible consequences of such a decision for other people had to be carefully considered. He praised the \"fantastic work\" of the Nepalese soldiers. </p> <p><b>Arrests in Israel</b><br>The government will continue to press Israeli authorities over the arrest of three British Muslim women in Jerusalem, Mr Blair pledged. The trio - a Cambridge maths student, teacher, and lawyer - were allegedly strip-searched and arrested under anti-terrorist laws after police raided their room. Hajira Qureshi, Samra Ghafoor and Amina Shaikh were ordered to leave Israel despite the accusations being dropped, according to reports. </p> <p><b>Violence and video games</b><br>Ultra-violent video game Manhunt - blamed for inspiring the brutal murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah - was condemned by the prime minister as wholly unsuitable for children. Mr Blair said responsible adults had the right to choose what they watched but children needed to be protected. He agreed to discuss with the home secretary David Blunkett what action could be taken. </p> <p><b>Right to roam</b><br> New rights of access for walkers to thousands of square miles of countryside were hailed by the prime minister. He said he was hopeful walkers could enjoy the extended access without impinging on landowners. </p> <p><b>Military liability</b><br> Allegations of abuse by British soldiers cannot be ignored by prosecutors, the prime minister insisted. He was responding to calls from Labour's Gordon Prentice for soldiers cleared by the military not to be prosecuted in court. Mr Blair told him: \"In respect of allegations of abuse we have to investigate them and if necessary prosecute them.\" </p> <p><b>Travellers</b><br> New powers to deal with problem travellers were \"sufficiently strong\", Mr Blair insisted but agreed to look again at the issue. He said he knew from experience in his Sedgefield constituency that there was a \"major issue\" that needed to be tackled. A policy review of the whole approach to travellers would be published \"shortly\". </p> <p> <b>Regeneration funding</b><br> A number of funding streams for regeneration projects is causing unnecessary difficulty and bureaucracy, Mr Blair acknowledged. He told Labour's Graham Allen money being invested in regeneration initiatives was making a real difference. But he added: \"There is a plethora of funding streams and this causes unnecessary difficulty and bureaucracy. The new local area agreements that merge various funding streams at local level to support the delivery of agreed outcome are going to be taken forward now.\" </p> <p><b>Food miles</b><br> The prime minister conceded he had no idea what his government was doing to combat the problem of so-called \"food miles\". Tory Andrew Turner told him the island was one of Britain's prime tomato producers, adding: \"It is hard to find island tomatoes in local supermarkets but I can buy mange tout from Sierra Leone.\" Mr Blair told him: \"The mangetout section has been left out of my brief and I apologise for that. To be absolutely frank I don't know.\" </p> <p><b>Armed forces pensions</b><br>The government was defeated in the Lords over pensions for widows of service personnel by 111 votes to 110 during debate on the armed forces (pensions and compensation bill.

  "A Briton who was shot dead in an apparent terrorist attack outside a Saudi shopping centre has been identified as an employee of the communications company Marconi. <p>Edward Stuart Muirhead-Smith, 56, was killed in the car park of the Max shopping centre in eastern Riyadh yesterday, British Embassy spokesman Salah Taha said. </p> <p>The Saudi interior ministry announced the shooting last night, but did not say whether it was an act of terrorism. </p> <p>The British ambassador to Saudi, Sherard Cowper-Coles, has condemned the killing, saying of Mr Muirhead-Smith's family and friends: \"They should know - as the terrorists must know - that his murder will only make the British government more determined to stand with the Saudi government and people in the struggle against senseless terror of this kind.\" </p> <p>The Saudi-owned TV station Al-Arabiya reported that two men in a white Toyota car shot the Briton four times in the car park and then fled. The Saudi state-guided newspaper Arab News reported the same details today, adding that police were looking for two Saudi suspects and that Mr Muirhead-Smith was shot in his car. </p> <p>A spokesman for Marconi in Britain, David Beck, confirmed that Mr Muirhead-Smith worked for the company. </p> <p>There have been a spate of attack against foreigners in Saudi Arabia by militants bent on driving the foreigners out of the country to hurt the economy. </p> <p>The Saudi economy, particularly the oil sector, depends on foreign workers.

  "<p>I took many exasperating telephone calls from the press during my time in Downing Street, but one in particular sticks in my mind. It was from Lady Olga Maitland, happily relieved of her duties as MP for Sutton and Cheam and relegated again to the role of gossip columnist. She wanted to know how the prime minister's wife could have the temerity to use the name Cherie Booth QC on her Downing Street notepaper. </p> <p>After five minutes of \"Who does she think she is?\" invective, I managed to shut her up by asking her whether Maitland was her married name (it wasn't), and why she had used a hereditary title throughout her professional career. Cherie, after all, had earned the right to call herself a Queen's Counsel. </p> <p>There were many other such trivial inquiries, of course. Was it true that Cherie had Downing Street feng shui-ed (false), paid for her hairdresser to travel with her (true), wore an acupuncture stud in her ear (true) and, shock, horror, had some left-of-centre views and wore a pendant? (True, but did anybody really care?) </p> <p>But the saga of the headed paper, which is churned out again at regular intervals and gathers more opprobrium as time goes on, sums up the dilemma facing the handful of people in any generation who have to fulfil one of the highest profile roles in British politics - that of the prime minister's spouse. </p> <p>You may be judged one of the most powerful women in the world (according to Forbes magazine anyway), but almost 100 years after we got the vote, and in an era where women have reached the top in most institutions, including politics, using your own name on a piece of headed paper is, it seems, one step too far. </p> <p>In her new book, The Goldfish Bowl, the prime minister's wife focuses on her predecessors rather than herself. This is a wise move. Having read much of the correspondence she received over the years, I know that the public is, on balance, supportive, but sees the prime minister's spouse as someone in a position of power and privilege. The power should be used to help them (and they write in their thousands, with often heart-breaking personal stories), never yourself, and writing a book about your own time in Downing Street while in office would most definitely be seen as cashing in. With the exception of Lord Bragg's unfortunate comments this week about the Blairs' personal life, all publicity surrounding the book has been sufficiently anodyne to deflect any such criticism, though the same might not be true of Cherie's imminent and reportedly lucrative American speaking tour. </p> <p>The privilege of being first spouse is something to be respected and never complained about. Being a hard-working successful professional person in your own right is good. You can even get away with articulating trenchant views, although it is advisable to steer clear of foreign affairs - especially the Palestinian situation - and of appearing soft on criminals if you benefit from a highly guarded home and police protection. </p> <p>You are also expected to look good at all times in public, especially when representing the country, and not to forget your hat if the Queen is present. The combination of no hat and lipstick a shade too red for middle England at Diana's funeral brought forth a torrent of angry letters, as did the same alleged \"gaffe\" when it was repeated at the Golden Jubilee lunch. You will be forgiven, however, for looking like an ordinary soul when you open the door in your nightie .... as long as you have stuck to all the other rules above. </p> <p>But the most innocuous, tiny mis-step can attract howls of outrage. Who would have thought that the retirement of Humphrey the cat to the country would morph into the alleged putting down of the nation's favourite pet by the PMs wife? (I still have the photograph of a rictus-grinning Cherie and Humphrey - look, he's alive, honest - which we had to mail to the legions of incandescent cat lovers.) Or that so many people could care about her eating foie gras? But they did, and wrote in their thousands to tell us so after it appeared on the menu at a dinner with the Clintons. </p> <p>It's a tall order and a miracle that anyone wants to do it, although, of course, most candidates don't recognise what they are letting themselves in for as the heady lure of power beckons their partners. And although Cherie Booth has done more to transform the role of the PM's spouse than any of her predecessors, we are still a long way off reaching a sensible consensus on what it involves. The publication of her book may give us an opportunity to try and understand how the job looks from inside and reassess how we, the public and the media, treat the families of politicians and the effect that has on our politics. </p> <p>Being the partner of a political creature can be very lonely, something which often takes courage to admit. Private emotions and beliefs often have to co-exist with the sometimes conflicting desire to achieve bigger, possibly more worthwhile, goals such as winning elections, changing the country and making other peoples' lives better. To a lesser extent, after my partner, Alastair Campbell, became press secretary to the leader of the opposition, we had to perform that balancing act between the personal and the political. But the prime minister's family, in particular, have to perfect this. Maybe they shouldn't expect sympathy for their lot but a bit of understanding wouldn't go amiss if we want to see the best people in the job. </p> <p>It is also an exclusive business. At the heart of most successful political operations there is usually a small, tight-knit team that lives, eats and breathes together and almost becomes a substitute for the real family. In my case it became a case of \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\", and I ended up as a special adviser in No10 supporting the prime minister's wife. But finding a neatly defined niche like that is harder if you are the spouse. </p> <p>There was a lot of anxiety back then about whether a high-achieving, intelligent professional wife would pose a problem for a would-be prime minister. The jury was still out on Hillary Clinton in the US and memories of the treatment that the Kinnocks had received in the 1980s cast a long shadow over New Labour, which I instinctively felt was misplaced. Glenys Kinnock, a long-standing friend of mine, had been unfairly maligned by the press but had remained gutsy and uncompromising, and in the end won respect from the public. </p> <p>She had paved the way for subsequent political wives like Cherie, who seemed to sum up so many of the aspirations of modern women - here was a woman from a working-class background who had reached the top of her profession, yet also enjoyed a close and loving marriage, normal kids and strong views of her own. If anything, she could enhance her husband's image if she managed to navigate her way through the elephant traps the media were laying. </p> <p>Her natural warmth, intelligence and strength of character, combined with a genuine desire not to have her privacy invaded, shone through and, rather than scaring them off, she began to win the public over. By the general election of 1997, even her most begrudging detractors were being forced to admit that it is possible to be a clever, feisty, successful woman and not frighten the voters. </p> <p>It is strange looking back to remember that in the days following the 1997 election victory, there was much speculation about whether she would be able to continue her career and be the first working mother in Downing Street. On her first day back in court, five days after the election, the press benches were full of reporters but after an hour or so of Tupe (employee rights law), they conceded defeat and sloped off, allowing Cherie to set an important precedent for women by proving that a modern British prime minister could have a wife who worked. </p> <p>Of course, there were the predictable media criticisms in the early days - her clothes, her hair, even her smile and the fact that she was being gagged and prevented from speaking her mind by me. In fact, she spoke in public frequently on a wide range of legal and equality issues, as well as the treatment of women in prison, breast cancer and disadvantaged children, but not, of course, the issues the press particularly wanted to hear about. </p> <p>What most of the commentators meant was that she wasn't speaking to them and giving interviews about her personal life, something the general public seemed to respect her for. I have to hand it to her that, when that moment finally came in the Daily Telegraph last week, she handled it masterfully, posing for nice pictures but giving nothing away, but also confirming my view that giving interviews while still in Downing Street is rather a pointless exercise. (And if she wanted to write a book making the case for redefining the first spouse's role, it would be more effective later on, out of office, when she could tell her own story more frankly.) </p> <p>If Cherie signalled her intention to do things differently early on, a lot of things changed inside Downing Street, too. Following the precedent set by Norma Major, who fought for a part-time secretary paid for by the government, former Blair aide Roz Preston and I were taken on as a job share to deal with the diary and thousands of letters she started to receive - a job I subsequently did full-time. The whole nature of the events programme was changed as we opened it up to scores of small, low-key charities and ensured that all the big government events were attended by managers and workers from the public sector and not just the great and the good. </p> <p>We even persuaded the powers-that-be to allow children in for tea once a month (initially a great cause for concern in case one of them put a sticky finger on a picture). All that, combined with the constant coming and going of the Blair children, bikes, skateboards and friends, began to make it feel more lived in and less like the museum it seemed on the first day when one of the senior civil servants responsible for \"the House\" pointed to the extensive garden and explained that the small strip of grass in the corner was where the children could play. </p> <p>With hindsight, though, we were only tinkering at the edges. Rather than apologetically sneaking in one very minor special-adviser post, we should have used the overwhelming public goodwill in 1997 to formally redefine the role of PM spouse and fund it accordingly. </p> <p>If the public expect the prime minister's wife to reply to their letters, endorse their charities, turn up to give the prizes at their children's schools, open their hospitals, grace all the great state events, perform an important diplomatic role both at home and abroad while keeping the home fires burning - at all times looking the part - surely it is reasonable to expect that some of the cost of hairdressers, clothes, transport etc, should be met? </p> <p>Even though the spouse has no constitutional position in the way a government minister or member of the royal family might, and is not elected, in Cherie's case she was in as much, if not more, demand, suggesting that the public see her in a some sort of formal role which she rightly wanted to fulfil. Yet she was expected to meet that demand without any of the formal backup in the way of briefing, scheduling and transport a minister or minor royal would take for granted. </p> <p>Having made that break with the past, we should have made it clear that Cherie Booth QC was also a professional figure entitled to a private life but with legitimate views on a wide range of issues on which she could speak publicly, but which would have no bearing on how the government did its work. </p> <p>If we had taken this fairly minor step, both in financial cost and principle, I believe that the public, who do have high expectations but are also tolerant and understanding, would have accepted it and a lot of the later image problems which arose as her own financial insecurity collided with attempts to make or save money (the Bristol flat purchase, the Australian supermarket sweep and the alleged discounts on clothes) might have been avoided. </p> <p>Why didn't we do it? Partly because of New Labour's underlying mistrust of anyone who might deviate from \"the line\", even if she is the prime minister's wife; partly because it would have involved a battle with the civil service, when there were more important issues to argue over; and partly because we were too nervous about what the rightwing tabloids would say. But riding the tiger of public opinion with the tabloids (with the Mail newspapers in a league of their own) is a lose-lose situation in the long run for any high-profile women in public life, and near impossible for a prime minister's wife </p> <p>However disciplined, discreet and controlled you are, the rules change all the time. One minute your appearance is being trashed and you're a wimp for allowing the spin doctors to dumb you down, the next you are in the doghouse for spending a fortune of your own money trying to look good and daring to speak on a platform with a cabinet minister while putting your name on your notepaper. Any word or action out of place is ripe for picking over and repackaged by scores of (mostly women) columnists and commentators, often recasting it completely to a much wider audience. </p> <p>Much simpler to set out your stall at the start, with a generous set of ground rules, and appeal directly to the public's good sense, rather than try and conform to everyone else's image of what the perfect political wife should be. Choose the second route and, in the end, that pressure to conform becomes oppressive and any independent-minded woman worth her salt will want to break out. </p> <p>Even as a minnow in the goldfish bowl I found the requirement to toe the line politically ultimately overbearing and suspect that the pressure to conform and perform in so many other ways took its toll on Cherie. Perhaps it contributed to some of the ill-fated decisions of the past few years as she struggled to assert her independence against the system which I, in particular, represented. And as the Daily Mail-reading public subsequently had explained to them in graphic detail, my advice was increasingly ignored as I, the dour leftwing feminist, began to lose the battle for Cherie's heart and mind to the glossy sex symbol Carole \"the Conquerer\" Caplin and left Downing Street - a painful and much more complicated process than the tabloid soap opera it became, but with hindsight, probably inevitable. </p> <p>Most destructive of all, of course, was the misjudgment of Peter Foster, the loyal but ultimately damaging decision to stick by Caplin after her full flakiness was revealed to the world on TV, and to a lesser extent the weird practitioners and the decisions about money. But at the end of the day many of these were private and, setting aside the initial failure to come clean on Foster, fairly trivial matters which led to disproportionate public vilification, usually at the hands of one or two completely unaccountable newspaper editors, who would recoil in horror at having their own personal lives laid bare in a similar way. </p> <p>However, those are the rules of engagement that you sign up to in 21st-century political life with a \"self-regulated\" press. The real tragedy is that, having watched the current incumbent push the boundaries so far in terms of establishing that the prime minister's wife can also be an independent professional woman and a mother, our collective failure to understand the balancing act and properly redefine the role for the modern world may have left the job of PM's spouse seeming less desirable than ever. Whoever does eventually follow her will no doubt enjoy the right to go out to work, but would need nerves of steel to ask for anything more.</p>",
  "Oi! Chicken breath,\" a sergeant barks from the barrack gym. Groups of squaddies are being put through their paces at the army school of physical training in Aldershot. It hurts just to look. <p>As he hurtles up the steep folds of the beech woods near Aldershot, in Hampshire, the entirely sweat-free Sergeant Paddy Paton calmly discusses how he is required to do 77 press-ups in two minutes, 72 sit-ups and then go for two 45-minute runs every day. Fast. </p> <p>It is these images of uncompromising endurance that the army hopes will bring victory in its first ever foray into the tough terrain of global capitalism. With UK Gear, a tiny sportswear manufacturer from the Midlands, the army yesterday launched the PT-03, a running shoe that is named after its \"physical training\" and proudly bears the insignia of the British army on its tongue. </p> <p>More than 65m pairs of trainers are sold in Britain every year. Rather than buy trainers endorsed by Michael Jordan, the army and UK Gear hope that serious runners will buy the army-endorsed PT-03, which has been tested to destruction by the army's 450 full-time physical training instructors as they pounded up and down the land during the past eight months. </p> <p>Staggering through the woods next to the physical training school, the gentlemen of Fleet Street fared less well than the PT-03s they were testing. Sergeant Paton has run 80 miles a week in the trainers for the last four months. </p> <p>\"Do you know what we call HILLS?\" he barked cheerily as we struggled up a gentle incline in our PT-03s. \"Hi, I Love Little Inclines.\" </p> <p>Bringing up the rear, the man from the Times turned beetroot and, while the light, bouncy shoes felt comfortable, they hardly turned your distinctly under-muscled correspondent into the new Kelly Holmes, let alone a man fit for combat. </p> <p>The army is pitching its brand into a uniquely competitive market. The push to design the perfect trainer, and sell it by the shed-load, is the global sportswear manufacturer's arms race. </p> <p>Year zero was 1979, when Nike started the revolution by putting air in its soles. It set the tone for ever-more sophisticated shoes, boasting \"energy return systems\" or ultra-light absorbing gels. Brands such as Adidas were then adopted by new trendsetters in hip-hop, turning serious sports shoes into mainstream fashion accessories. </p> <p>Nike and Adidas led the way in volume of sales, but serious runners remained notoriously conservative, unimpressed by endorsements and advertising campaigns. The low-profile Asics are the leading \"serious\" brand, with some 40% of athletes wearing their trainers at races. </p> <p>According to Colonel Robin Clifford, director of international defence training in the army, the army has been actively seeking to \"exploit\" its \"image and reputation\" since the government unveiled the concept of \"wider markets\" in 1998. A Treasury-led initiative, it urged all government departments to generate extra income from \"spare capacity\", including real estate and, crucially, intellectual property rights such as images and brands. </p> <p>\"It became apparent that a number of people were using and exploiting the army image for commercial gain,\" said Col Clifford. \"This [trainer] was exactly the sort of thing we were looking for to act as a pilot and use the army's expertise practically.\" </p> <p>Col Clifford accepts the PT-03 is a risky venture. While the army has not invested any money in the shoes, it will gain a \"normal royalty\" from the sale of every pair. </p> <p>However, it would be deeply embarrassed if its fledgling attempt to market its brand ended in commercial failure. UK Gear, best known for making cricket kit for the West Indies, is a minnow. The firm recruited designers from bigger brands in the PT-03's \"six figure\" design process, but employs just seven people. </p> <p>The trainers are not, however, a model of military grit. The manufacturers insist they are not made in a sweatshop but they are produced in Vietnam. And while the PT-03s are being tested for their suitability for army procurement, they will not yet be an official piece of kit issued to all soldiers. </p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Phil Watkins, the army's most senior physical training instructor, is convinced they will be a success. He first wore the shoes six months ago for a double mountain marathon. \"I took them out of the box, put them on and whilst they are not designed for fell running, they performed well. Cross-country, they were superb. I didn't get a single blister.\" He has been training in them ever since. </p> <p>Other soldiers also approve. \"They are better than our Hi-Tech Silver Shadows,\" said one sergeant - although that is hardly a ringing endorsement given that the army-issue Hi-Techs date from the 1980s and sell for just \u00a320. </p> <p>While the PT-03 boasts the usual range of baffling, apparently pseudo-scientific features, from the royal air mesh to the \"2nd density EVA compound for enhanced medial motion control\" in its heel, experts suggest it is a respectable competitor in an increasingly scientific field. </p> <p>\"There is a huge amount of science behind running shoes now,\" said Andy Barber, deputy editor of Running Fitness magazine. \"If you go into any of the global HQs of the major sports manufacturers you are looking at something like a laboratory. It is a mix of science and art.\" </p> <p>Although the PT-03 does not propel unfit journalists up hills, its success, according to Mr Barber, will depend on whether the army's brand is enough to persuade naturally conservative runners to switch from their tried-and-trusted trainers. \"It is not a shoe you would wear in a nightclub, but then core runners will like it because they are averse to gimmicks and gadgetry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Conrad Black has opened up a new front in his legal wars, filing a lawsuit against a Canadian magazine for a satirical article that envisaged the deposed press baron descending into hell.</p> <p>The former Daily Telegraph boss is seeking nearly \u00a31m in damages from Toronto Life magazine and the article's writer and illustrator, according to reports in the Canadian press.</p> <p>The four-page article, \"A Toast to Lord Black on His Arrival in Hell\", appeared in the July issue of the magazine.

  "Ministers were last night considering a ban on demonstrations in Parliament Square and the introduction of armed police to guard the doors of the House of Commons in the wake of the most flagrant breach of parliamentary security in living memory. <p>Five protesters - members of the Countryside Alliance - with clear inside knowledge of the layout of the Commons, stormed the floor of the chamber at 4.20pm yesterday. The intruders had evaded armed police outside parliament and footmen in tights by donning construction suits and using back stairs. </p> <p>Their entry route took them within yards of the offices of cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, Tony Blair, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and the home secretary, David Blunkett. </p> <p>There were suggestions that a Tory MP's researcher may have been involved. Questions were also being asked why a door leading to the floor of the Commons that should have been locked had been left open. </p> <p>The group of eight protesters took off their suits in a corridor above the Commons chamber, and then invaded the chamber, shouting at the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael: \"This is is not democracy. This is a denial of democracy.\" </p> <p>Three of the eight protesters, all under arrest last night, were stopped before they reached the chamber. They were arrested for uttering a forged instrument, burglary with intent to commit criminal damage, and violent disorder. </p> <p>Amongst the protesters' discarded clothes was a forged letter claiming that they had been invited to a meeting along the committee room corridor by two MPs, Labour's Kerry Pollard and the Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell. </p> <p>It was revealed last night that members of the protest group had undertaken a dry run on Tuesday. The BBC was made aware of this by the protesters, but failed to report the matter to the parliamentary authorities - an issue that is likely to lead to a row within the BBC, and between the BBC and MPs. One of those arrested was Otis Ferry, a Shropshire huntsman and the son of pop star Bryan Ferry. </p> <p>In a statement last night to MPs, the Speaker, Michael Martin, said he had asked the Metropolitan police to significantly increase its presence in parliament. Mr Martin said it was not clear yet whether a Commons pass holder \"who apparently gave assistance to the intruders\" was a member of staff, a member of the press, or an employee of a MP. </p> <p>\"All these possibilities are being investigated. For tomorrow's sitting I have asked the Metropolitan police to provide a significant additional squad of police officers to be deployed in the immediate vicinity of the chamber until this house rises.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Commons Authority declined to comment on whether CCTV cameras were in place in corridors around the chamber, where armed police were still on guard last night. </p> <p>The invasion forced a 20-minute suspension of proceedings as stunned MPs assessed the violation of democratic debate. But the protest failed to stop mainly Labour MPs forcing through in one day a bill banning hunting. The vote was 356 to 166 at the bill's second reading. Mr Blair, a previous opponent of fox hunting, did not vote. </p> <p>In the wake of the security lapse, the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, along with Mr Blunkett, were at meetings last night reviving demands that armed policemen be posted at the six doors leading to the Commons chamber, instead of unarmed badge messengers in tights. </p> <p>Mr Hain is determined to preserve the right of democratic protest within Parliament Square. But both men agree that there should be a powerful single head of security reporting directly to the Serjeant at Arms, Sir Michael Cummins, and his opposite number in the Lords, Black Rod. </p> <p>The two ministers had sought but failed to secure the changes after flour was thrown on the prime minister from the public gallery. One source blamed \"the establishment that runs this building, especially the Serjeant at Arms\". </p> <p>It was also a dramatic day outside the Commons as a minority among thousands of noisy rural protesters in Parliament Square battled with truncheon-wielding police. </p> <p>At one point the anxious Speaker peered through the gates of parliament to see if the police could hold the line, and prevent a mass invasion of its precincts. Police made 15 other arrests during the demonstration, and 17 protesters and two officers were injured. </p> <p>The Countryside Alliance's chairman, John Jackson, condemned \"these lawless activities which are selfish and self-indulgent. However appalling the behaviour of Alun Michael, people should not allow themselves to be provoked into activities of this kind which can only harm the cause for which thousands of their fellows are demonstrating peacefully\". </p> <p>Conservative MPs also condemned the violence unequivocally. </p> <p>Earlier Mr Michael, who has travelled the country putting the case for a compromise solution involving the regulation of hunts under a strict code, faced protests from Tory and some Labour MPs over the use of the Parliament Act to bypass the House of Lords. He told them that it had be come clear \"that the two sides are so polarised ... this is the same bill that came before the house last year and was debated extensively at that time. This issue has been taking up parliament's time year after year and it's an issue that must be brought to a conclusion\". </p> <p>Peers now have just 30 days to decide whether to accept the will of the Commons or see the measure forced onto the statute book without their consent by use of the Parliament Act. </p> <p>With the Countryside Alliance intent on taking legal action against the government on the grounds that use of the Parliament Act to fast-track legislation breaches the European convention on human rights, Mr Michael said ministers were confident any attempt to invoke the convention would fail. </p> <p>He said the government had tried to get a dialogue between supporters and opponents of hunting. But, time and again, the Lords had vetoed legislation, and Labour's last manifesto had made clear that if the upper house continued to block the Commons \"we will look at how it can be resolved\". </p> <p>The Tory rural affairs spokesman, Oliver Heald, accused ministers of using \"draconian powers\", and of indecision over the past seven years. \"They've started and checked, they've jinked and dived, they've been up hill and down dale ... now they say it's a matter of such serious importance it must be dealt with now.\" </p> <p>At question time in the Commons, Michael Howard taunted the prime minister, accusing him of making hunting a priority above issues of more pressing importance. \"When are you going to get to grips with the problems people really care about?\" he asked. </p> <p>Some Labour backbenchers were also sceptical. Barry Sheerman criticised bypassing the Lords in order to drive through the legislation. \"Surely this is hardly the issue to use the Parliament Act ... in order to overrule not only the House of Lords but also to steam roller this through against a very large minority that don't want it.\" </p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats, Andrew George maintained the debate was about \"who runs the country. Is it based on primogeniture and birthright - what one might describe as the old boy network, or it is run on the basis of democracy?\" </p> <p>The veteran leftwinger Dennis Skinner accused opponents of the bill of \"whingeing and whining ... tell the House of Lords to go to hell and that we'll carry the bill\".</p>",
  "The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, declared explicitly for the first time last night that the US-led war on Iraq was illegal. <p>Mr Annan said that the invasion was not sanctioned by the UN security council or in accordance with the UN's founding charter. In an interview with the BBC World Service broadcast last night, he was asked outright if the war was illegal. He replied: \"Yes, if you wish.\" </p> <p>He then added unequivocally: \"I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter. From our point of view and from the charter point of view it was illegal.\" </p> <p>Mr Annan has until now kept a tactful silence and his intervention at this point undermines the argument pushed by Tony Blair that the war was legitimised by security council resolutions. </p> <p>Mr Annan also questioned whether it will be feasible on security grounds to go ahead with the first planned election in Iraq scheduled for January. \"You cannot have credible elections if the security conditions continue as they are now,\" he said. </p> <p>His remarks come amid a marked deterioration of the situation on the ground, an upsurge of violence that has claimed 200 lives in four days and raised questions over the ability of the interim Iraqi government and the US-led coalition to maintain control over the country. </p> <p>They also come as Mr Blair is trying to put the controversy over the war behind him in the run-up to the conference season, a new parliamentary term and next year's probable general election. </p> <p>The UN chief had warned the US and its allies a week before the invasion in March 2003 that military action would violate the UN charter. But he has hitherto refrained from using the damning word \"illegal\". </p> <p>Both Mr Blair and the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, claim that Saddam Hussein was in breach of security council resolution 1441 passed late in 2002, and of previous resolutions calling on him to give up weapons of mass destruction. France and other countries claimed these were insufficient. </p> <p>No immediate comment was available from the White House late last night, but American officials have defended the war as an act of self-defence, allowed under the UN charter, in view of Saddam Hussein's supposed plans to build weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>However, last September, Mr Annan issued a stern critique of the notion of pre-emptive self-defence, saying it would lead to a breakdown in international order. Mr Annan last night said that there should have been a second UN resolution specifically authorising war against Iraq. Mr Blair and Mr Straw tried to secure this second resolution early in 2003 in the run-up to the war but were unable to convince a sceptical security council. </p> <p>Mr Annan said the security council had warned Iraq in resolution 1441 there would be \"consequences\" if it did not comply with its demands. But he said it should have been up to the council to determine what those consequences were.</p>",
  "<p>A careering, out-of-control golf cart came close to taking out a third of Europe's Ryder Cup team yesterday at Oakland Hills as the teams prepared for the 35th edition of the match. </p> <p>Not that this was the latest attempt by the Americans to get the cup back at all costs, rather the failure of a marshal to adequately control his buggy. The incident occurred on the 12th where, after Darren Clarke, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez and Lee Westwood had teed off and were walking down the hill, the buggy began to follow. </p> <p>The man driving it bent down to pick up what looked like a dropped towel and, in doing so, lost control and fell out. The buggy continued downhill and the players and their caddies were given shouted warnings of imminent danger. </p> <p>The danger was never mortal; the cart was slowing sufficiently for the players and caddies to scramble out of its way, but at least one bag was dropped in the confusion. The cart continued through the rough, the ropes and the crowd before reaching the trees, where it stopped. By now, with any possible threat over, all concerned were laughing and afterwards the players dismissed the incident. \"No harm done,\" they said. </p> <p>There would have been no danger of the cart mowing down Phil Mickelson, given that the American chose not to be on the course at all yesterday. On Monday he had spent 7 hours re-acquainting himself with Oakland Hills and he decided that a rest day was in order. \"I feel that I am ready for every pin placement that is possible,\" he said, \"how I want to attack it and so forth.\" </p> <p>Mickelson, who has won the US Masters and then finished second, third and sixth in the US Open, the Open and the US PGA this year playing with Titleist woods and balls, switched to Callaway two weeks ago. It was a strange move given that he had attributed part of his new-found major success to his equipment. </p> <p>He changed his swing in order to be able to hit a fade and changed to a different type of Titleist ball to assist that shape of shot. Now all is abandoned and it is not for the money - or at least he says it isn't. \"For me to play my best I need to be excited about what I have, and I am.\" </p> <p>Mickelson also had some advice for Detroit's golf fans, 35,000 of whom will be present each day. In polite language it boils down to \"Don't rile Monty\". Asked about the effect the Scot seems to have on European Ryder Cup teams, Mickelson said: \"Nobody was more impressed than I was at Brookline in '99 when he took a lot of ribbing and was able to perform at the highest level of anybody there. </p> <p>\"So maybe that's kind of a word to the wise that we shouldn't piss him off. Maybe we should downplay it a little bit and not agitate him so much.\" </p> <p>They would be wise not to piss off Thomas Levet, too. The Frenchman was asked if he expected any heckling of the type he had received when playing in Florida at the time that France refused to join in the war in Iraq. \"It's forgiven,\" he said. \"I forget about it and I forgive them by doing that.\" </p> <p>But, just for good measure he reminded his listeners that Canada was only a few hundred yards away across the Detroit River. </p> <p>\"They speak French over there,\" he said. \"If there is trouble I call in the French mafia.\" </p> <p>Levet, who once reacted to an attempted mugging by knocking out one of his three assailants, loves the idea of the pressure of a Ryder Cup. The debutant said yesterday: \"I have played the Ryder Cup 6,000 times lately.\" In his imagination, of course. \"On the range I imagine I'm hitting the first tee shot in the Ryder Cup, or the last putt at the Open, so that when the situation comes in I've been there a lot of times. I've seen people cheering for me, people yelling at me, l've seen the crowd jumping out of their seats and getting completely mad - so I'm ready for any situation at the moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>French rally drivers used to be rather like French rugby teams: sublime one week, an exasperating rabble the next. S\u00e9bastien Loeb is a very contemporary French sportsman, rather more consistent than the Six Nations champions, and if he does not win the Rally of Great Britain this weekend it will be because winning is no longer necessary. </p> <p>Loeb's consistency is in fact astonishing. The 30-year-old has won five of this year's first 11 world championship rallies and had pocketed four wins by July. His Citro\u00ebn's dependability - he has retired from only one of his past 19 rallies - has been complemented by his growing assurance and, whereas all his opponents have crashed more than once, his one blemish this year was a testing accident in Germany. He has a 30-point world championship lead and, despite the ritual insistence that anything can happen, it will take an act of God to deny him now. </p> <p>\"I think a number of things have changed this year. I've got more experience, which certainly makes me quicker, and the car too has improved a lot since last year,\" he explained. \"Compared to two years ago the car's a lot more consistent and easier to drive. As I've got more experience, I know how to control a rally better, whether to attack or pace myself a bit.\" </p> <p>Loeb's methodical approach is apt to make the task seem easier than it is, but his rise has been all the more remarkable considering that he did not contest a rally until he was 23. There was neither the family interest nor the money to fund a rally car and he might easily have remained an electrician if it weren't for a mixture of institutional provision and private generosity. </p> <p>The French automobile sport federation holds regular competitions to identify potential rally drivers and although Loeb did not win in two attempts his efforts caught the attention of two enthusiasts from his native Alsace, Dominique Heintz and R\u00e9mi Mammosser, who offered to fund his career. </p> <p>He won his class on his first rally in their Peugeot and swiftly progressed to Citro\u00ebn championships with Heintz and Mammosser's support. With Citro\u00ebn's backing he won the inaugural junior world championship in 2001 and has been an integral part of their team ever since. </p> <p>Loeb is a shining instance of general experience being worth as much as a grounding in a particular sport. His father was a gymnastics teacher and he began training at three. \"When I competed in gymnastics I was champion of Alsace several times, then I was champion of France,\" he said. \"I started taking part in gymnastics competitions when I was six or seven and I went on until I was 16. </p> <p>\"Gymnastics is a sport with plenty of pressure, because you've got six judges in front of you, you can't afford to make a mistake and it all happens in a minute. That's real pressure. If I seem calm now, it's perhaps because I've learned to control pressure better and to keep my spirits up even so.\" </p> <p>A spin on the Tour of Corsica cost him his chance of becoming the 2003 world champion but it was his last significant error and the accusation that he is consistent rather than quick looks lame in view of his 2004 record, which includes the first win for a non-Nordic driver on the Swedish Rally. </p> <p>Loeb may well break the record of six victories in a season, set by his fellow countryman Didier Auriol in 1992, and yet there is something instinctively cautious about him that shies away from talk of records and championships. Indeed, it is only 18 months since he publicly queried whether he was world champion material at all. </p> <p>Although he will undoubtedly set out to win in Wales, he will not want to compromise his points lead. That makes the reigning champion, Norway's Petter Solberg, favourite to complete a hat-trick for Subaru. </p> <p>This year's contest is the first not held in November since 1958 and marks a clean break with the old RAC Rally. The weather forecast is indifferent, but the forest roads of south Wales should be less muddy and treacherous than usual, which could make for a closer finish. </p> <p>However, there are legitimate doubts over most of Solberg's challengers: Marcus Gronholm has the pace but the Finn's Peugeot has been unreliable this year, and though Markko Martin's Ford should run sweetly the Estonian's eyesight has not fully recovered from his 110mph crash in Argentina in July. </p> <p>For the first time in 15 years there is no British driver in a winning car. The best bet is Mark Higgins, the gutsy Manxman fresh from victory on the Ulster Rally and a remarkable second in Turkey's European championship round. If he gets his two-year-old Ford Focus in the top five on Sunday afternoon it will be a victory of a kind.</p>",
  "A prominent Bradford lawyer was accused yesterday of involvement in running a \"sham\" practice following a spot check by the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors. <p>Aurangzeb Iqbal, 43, who organised mosque prayers for the England football team and was involved with Bradford City FC, denied the claim at a solicitors' disciplinary tribunal in London. </p> <p>He was accused with two partners, Michael Tracey and Sardar Qadri, both 46, of failing to keep proper accounts at Churchill Solicitors in Manningham, Bradford, and improperly withdrawing cash from client's accounts. </p> <p>The three are also charged with circumventing past Law Society restrictions on Mr Iqbal which allowed him to work only under supervision. </p> <p>The tribunal heard that the charges followed the arrival of an OSS investigator and accountant in February 2002. The hearing continues.</p>",
  "A row between Russia and America over Moscow's response to the Beslan tragedy escalated yesterday when George Bush voiced concern that a sweeping Kremlin security overhaul \"could undermine democracy\". <p>Hours after Russia warned Washington not to meddle in its internal affairs, Mr Bush expressed disquiet at moves by his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to fight Chechen terrorism by amassing more power for himself. </p> <p>\"As governments fight the enemies of democracy, they must uphold the principles of democracy,\" the president said. \"I'm ... concerned about the decisions that are being made in Russia that could undermine democracy.\" </p> <p>His remarks hinted at US unease that Mr Putin could use the \"war on terror\" to roll back post-Soviet reform. </p> <p>Mr Putin's chief initiative in response to the carnage at Beslan, blamed on Chechen militants, has involved abolishing elections for both constituency MPs and regional governors, and appointing the latter himself. </p> <p>Mr Bush warned: \"Great democracies have a balance of power between central gov ernments and local governments, a balance of power within central governments between the executive branch and the legislative branch and the judicial branch.\" </p> <p>The issue is the biggest diplomatic spat between Russia and the US for four years, in which relations between Mr Putin and Mr Bush have been relatively good. </p> <p>But when Colin Powell, the US secretary of state accused the Kremlin earlier yesterday of \"pulling back on some democratic reforms\", it drew a sharp riposte from Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister. \"The processes that are under way in Russia are our internal affair,\" he said. </p> <p>Although Mr Powell's rebuke was relatively mild, the Russian government is not in the mood to accept such criticism so soon after the Beslan atrocity, in which 320 people died, half of them children. </p> <p>Mr Lavrov said the US had no right to impose its model of democracy. \"And it is at least strange that, while talking about a certain 'pulling back', as he [Powell] put it, on some of the democratic reforms in the Russian Federation, he tried to assert yet one more time the thought that democracy can only be copied from someone's model,\" Mr Lavrov said, adding pointedly, in view of the outcome of the US 2000 election: \"We, for our part, do not comment on the US system of presidential elections, for instance.\" He also pointed to repressive measures after September 11. The US introduced a homeland security law that reversed previous legal rights, and had held hundreds at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba and the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan for more than two years without trial. </p> <p>The outgoing EU commissioner, Chris Patten, was more outspoken than the US, telling the European parliament yesterday that a resolution of the Chechen conflict lay in far-sighted and humane policies, rather than in reversing democracy. He hoped \"the government of the Russian Federation will not conclude that the only answer to terrorism is to increase the power of the Kremlin\". </p> <p>The British government has studiously stayed out of the row. The Foreign Office decided last week to postpone its annual report due to be published today, which would have been highly critical of human rights in Chechnya. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, has so far refused to comment on the changes in Russia. Asked on the BBC last week, he said it was inappropriate so soon after Beslan.</p>",
  "Lord Bragg was at home with his hairstyle yesterday and feeling like a man who has inadvertently shot a good friend in the back. <p>For a supposed master of interview technique, he had behaved with stunning naivety, claiming in an interview on the ITV News Channel that Tony Blair had been close to quitting in the spring - and spilling the secret that the Blair family had been under a colossal strain around that time. </p> <p>Yesterday Lord Bragg's friends were insisting that he had not intended to damage the prime minister and had certainly not made his remarks in the interview with Alastair Stewart as part of a ploy to win Mr Blair sympathy - a claim made initially by some supporters of the chancellor. </p> <p>Downing Street is seething at what they regard as a failure of judgment by one of the very few political figures invited to Cherie Blair's exclusive 50th birthday party at Chequers last weekend. </p> <p>Despite speculation at Westminster, Lord Bragg's statement was accidental, not intended. </p> <p>The interview had been arranged for some time. Sources at the ITV News Channel said Stewart had not been primed to ask any particular question. Lord Bragg's wife has co-authored a book about prime ministers' spouses with Cherie Blair. A now very stiff launch party is due to take place tonight. </p> <p>\"He's very down about this,\" said one friend yesterday. The effect of his unguarded remarks was to revive the speculation about how close a dispirited prime minister had come to quitting earlier this year, or had even reached an explicit agreement that he would stand down in favour of the chancellor at a prearranged date later this year. </p> <p>The issue is of more than historical or prurient interest. If Mr Blair has gone back on a private deal, the chancellor ca feel justifiably aggrieved. But if claims of a deal are wrong, then Mr Brown could be accused of seeking to destabilise his friend (again). </p> <p>\"Either way it's hell,\" said one cabinet minister in despair. </p> <p>In the absence of documentary evidence, picking one's way through the contradictory and elliptical accounts is fraught. But probably both sides would agree the descent into hell started with the Labour conference last year. </p> <p>On the day before Mr Blair was to make his speech, the chancellor appealed to the old Labour faithful and appeared to parody words previously used by the prime minister. Mr Blair regarded Mr Brown's speech as an affront. Then, returning from paternity leave in November, Mr Brown in turn went ballistic when he discovered the prime minister had rejected his second request for a seat on Labour's ruling national executive committee. </p> <p>With a backbench rebellion over tuition fees gathering steam, the row deepened and the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, brought together the prime minister and the chancellor for a dinner at his grace and favour apartment in Whitehall's Admiralty House to calm the atmosphere. </p> <p>The Prescott dinner is said to have started awkwardly, but the three eventually issued an unprecedented peace statement, saying they had \"agreed that a line should be drawn\" under recent events and promising rival briefings would be \"actively discouraged\". </p> <p>In dispute is whether Mr Blair went so far at that dinner last November as to promise to stand down before the election. Some insist an agreement was reached. </p> <p>But those at the centre of the Blair circle deny this. The prime minister felt that if ever he feared he was causing the party a problem, then he would give the premiership up. He had always wanted to give the chancellor the chance to succeed him, but he could not and would not give dates or circumstances. The offer was also conditional on the chancellor not jumping the gun. He had to behave in the meantime. </p> <p>Mr Prescott has often told the prime minister frankly that he is more of a Brownite than a Blairite, but he regards his prime task to unify the party and ensure continuity. </p> <p>On the eve of the Hutton report, Mr Brown's allies ostentatiously pulled back from a rebellion on tuition fees at the last moment. Mr Blair scraped through by five votes, but it was shown that his majority lay at the mercy of the chancellor. </p> <p>The early months of this year brought no relief for the prime minister. </p> <p>Battered by criticism over the invasion of Iraq and the rising postwar death toll, and watching a plunge in his \"trust\" ratings in the opinion polls, Mr Blair is said to have hit a low, and to have considered announcing in March his intention to step down later this year. </p> <p>According to a well-placed party figure, the prime minister and chancellor held several conversations before Easter on the Blair proposal to declare that he would leave No 10 some time this autumn. </p> <p>The tenant of No 11, anxious to move next door, is said to have urged him to keep his plan secret, and show his hand only on the morning of departure. </p> <p>The beauty of such a tactic for Mr Blair was the retention of authority otherwise likely to leech away the moment he was seen as a caretaker premier - and for the architect, Mr Brown, the opportunity to plan for a leadership election and gain a head start on would-be rivals. </p> <p>Probably Mr Blair's lowest point was just before he left for a brief holiday in Bermuda on April 9, ending with an awkward trip to Washington on April 14 at which he had to swallow difficult news on the Middle East. </p> <p>A few days later, he was further distracted and battered by an unexpected leak, and badly mishandled the revelation that he was to hold a referendum on a European constitution. Many cabinet ministers, including the education secretary, Charles Clarke, and the former Europe minister, Peter Hain, were left out of the loop and felt aggrieved. </p> <p>Days later the press started to report the horrors of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The human rights abuses by US forces knocked away one of Mr Blair's remaining pillars of his case for the invasion. </p> <p>Both Blairites and Brownites agree that if there was any inclination to quit, it did not stem from any Blair family difficulty. The prime minister's wife was one of those urging the prime minister to stay. It was around now that some cabinet ministers, including John Reid, Tessa Jowell, and Mr Clarke saw the prime minister and urged him to hang on. </p> <p>The prime minister is said to have made clear to the chancellor after June's European and local elections that he had changed his mind and would remain in post until after the election. </p> <p>Mr Blair is understood to have told Mr Brown that the worst of the Iraq crisis was over and, with the Tories doing badly, he was confident of securing a third electoral mandate. </p> <p>The five-year departmental plans were giving him a renewed sense of initiative, and his eyes were on an as yet ill-defined but radical manifesto. </p> <p>However, ministers in the bar of Brighton's Grand Hotel after Tuesday's TUC general council dinner this week privately expressed concern that planning for an election campaign had got off to a bad start over the Ian McCartney-Alan Milburn rift. </p> <p>Meanwhile Mr Brown, at the bedside of his elderly mother in Scotland, feels the Labour crown may have slipped out of his grasp for a second time in 10 years. </p> <p>The issue now is whether he will accept events, and whether Mr Blair can convince the chancellor that his role in the election will not substantially change from the previous two elections. The first test will come at conference.</p>",
  "The TUC conference in Brighton ends today after a row over Iraq, and widespread feeling that although the unions have reached a truce with the government, they have not been won round. <p>With work already under way to hold the Labour party conference in the same hall the week after next, a Labour official said yesterday that Tony Blair had \"called the bluff\" of the unions in his speech on Monday. </p> <p>By promising to implement the 56-point Warwick accord on employment rights, pensions, public services and manufacturing, he defused a dangerous row, but avoided making the sort of concessions many union leaders had wanted to see. </p> <p>With the party-union Warwick warranty safe, said the official, the unions were now under pressure to implement their part of the deal and campaign enthusiastically for Labour at the general election. </p> <p>The still raw wound of Iraq was evident yesterday when the TUC condemned the occupation, calling for an accurate audit of the number of civilians killed since the invasion. </p> <p>The union splits over Europe were evident when the congress agreed to take a formal stance on whether to support the proposed EU constitution in a referendum. </p> <p>Delegates backed a resolution from the general council which welcomed the decision to hold a referendum on the constitution, but said assessing the impact on key areas, such as workers' rights and public services, needed more time. </p> <p>It would be \"inappropriate to take a formal position for or against the constitution\" until a full debate had taken place, the TUC decided </p> <p>A more Eurosceptic resolution from the RMT union, which also called for debate but raised fears about the transfer of economic policy-making and control of the public sector to Brussels, was rejected. </p> <p>The RMT general secretary, Bob Crow, said it was essential to be sure what the constitution would mean for working people. </p> <p>\"If you are not going to have an economic policy, if you are not going to have a policy for government in the long term, if you are not going to have a policy for the army, you are not a government any more. You can't control your own destiny.\" </p> <p>The GMB general secretary, Kevin Curran, said there had to be informed debate because of the importance of the issues. </p> <p>\"It is about the future of the people of Europe and about our own social agenda,\" he said. </p> <p>But the talk in Brighton's bars was about the goings-on at Tuesday night's TUC dinner. After one union leader slipped in early to switch the name cards at the top table, the new Blairite cabinet minister Alan Milburn found himself sitting next to obscure US labour officials rather than Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary.</p>",
  "<p>The government's record as champion of the inner cities will be questioned tonight by one of its ministers. </p> <p>David Lammy, a minister in the Department of Constitutional Affairs, will call for a drive to rescue the inner cities from decline and a crippling \"poverty of ambition\". </p> <p>He will say that after seven years of a Labour government, the future of major cities still \"hangs in the balance\". </p> <p>Mr Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, north London, will also attack the materialistic culture which has poisoned many urban communities. </p> <p>Referring to the radicalism which allowed Labour to rebuild Britain after the second world war and to revolutionise race relations in the 1970s, he will urge his colleagues to make the transformation of the inner cities the party's next crusade. </p> <p>Delivering the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust's annual lecture, Mr Lammy will say reforms must focus on \"human capital\". </p> <p>\"For every generation held in the chains of poverty and ignorance, their hopes raised and dashed by broken promises, it becomes harder to free the next,\" he will say. </p> <p>He will praise Labour's policies which have pumped millions of pounds into the cities under the New Deal for Communities initiative. </p> <p>But he will add: \"I cannot help but feel that the people of our inner cities are entitled to expect much more.\" </p> <p>The government should banish the notion of the inner cities being associated with crime and poverty, he said. \"With the same ambition we have shown in our fight against child poverty, we ought to declare the eradication of the inner city as our next 20 year mission.\" </p> <p>He will call for the establishment of an urban league, an independent body to champion the inner cities. </p> <p>He will also recommend an increase in youth services as well as an extension in childcare and early years provision. </p> <p>Citing the scarcity of positive role models, he will call for Britain to become \"a nation of mentors\". </p> <p>In a speech punctuated with references to his upbringing in north London, Mr Lammy - Labour's youngest minister and one of only four black ministers - will be the first senior politician to speak out against the materialism of \"bling\" culture, a phenomenon said to have damaged social cohesion in the inner cities. </p> <p>\"We risk losing more and more of our young people to the seductive language of a growing gang culture,\" he will say. </p> <p>\"A language of get rich or die trying, a language of fast cars and faster lives, a language which replaces the social values that once knitted communities together with a destructive law of the jungle, in which honour codes create the justification for pointless spirals of killing and revenge.\" </p> <p>But the speech will also hold out the prospect that life for those in the inner cities can be transformed. </p> <p>\"Cities are clearly once again on the rise. Today, urban is aspirational. The affluent are flooding back to the centres of Manchester and Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle in their tens of thousands. In London the lifestyle magazines regularly predict which previously unfashionable postcode is going to be next season's must-have accessory, as the ripples of gentrification spread ever further. But what is true for Hoxton and Manchester's Canal Street, we must make true for Tower Hamlets and Moss Side.\"</p>",
  "An elected parliament's right to meet, debate and pass laws without fear of intimidation stands at the very heart of the democratic system. Any physical threat to that right is an event that should alarm any true democrat, whether it comes from the monarchy, as it did in the 17th century, the Luftwaffe, as in the 20th, or from the Countryside Alliance, as happened yesterday. In its own way, yesterday's 21st-century assault on parliament by pro-hunting militants was an attack on the liberty of the British people and its elected representatives as serious in principle as anything attempted by Guy Fawkes, Charles I or Hermann Goering's pilots. The irruption into the Commons chamber yesterday afternoon of five thugs, following a series of assaults on police protecting the House of Parliament, may not have been such a life-and-death challenge to this nation's democratic existence as Colonel Tejero's gun-toting raid was on the Spanish parliament in 1981. But it came from the same impulse. It was a desecration of the basic principles of democracy and law and it was absolutely beyond excuse. <p>The most immediate effect is certain to be another re-examination of security at Westminster. The current controls may be adequate in an essentially law-abiding and respectful society. But we no longer live in one of those, for good and ill. Ours is increasingly a society in which people believe they are entitled to say what they like and do what they like, and to disregard public limits. This sense of individual entitlement defines modern Britain in many different ways, and politics is certainly not exempt from its effects. This year, parliament has been invaded by protesters from Greenpeace, by disgruntled fathers' groups and now by the pro-hunting lobby. It feels only a matter of time before someone tries to kill a minister or an MP in the chamber.</p> <p>Some tightening of security is therefore unavoidable. The Commons staff, dressed in black tights and armed with ceremonial swords, were useless at protecting MPs yesterday; the time may have come for them to be replaced by trained police security. Yet it remains equally vital that the citizen's right to lobby an MP, as well as the MP's need to know what the citizen is thinking, is protected. A parliament that retreats ever further behind barbed wire and concrete barriers would be the wrong response. That is why the old ban on demonstrations in the vicinity of parliament - which was scrapped by the current government for good and principled reasons that have now proved unsustainable in practice - must be re-examined. The events of yesterday, and the protest stunt at Buckingham Palace on Monday, are also a warning that the imminent party conferences are at risk of similar disruptions, unless careful measures are taken to protect legitimate participants.</p> <p>The other immediate effect of yesterday's violence is to discredit the opponents of the ban on fox hunting. Many fair-minded people, as we said in this column only yesterday, were justifiably uneasy about the ban on libertarian grounds, even if they dislike hunting itself. Yesterday's mob scenes, however, will have forced many such people to come off the fence. The scenes shamed the organisations under whose umbrella the Straw Dogs element was able to shelter. They should also require the leaders of the pro-hunting campaign to re-examine their own role in encouraging violent protest and in supporting defiance of parliament and the law. Yet again, MPs voted by a huge majority yesterday - 356 votes to 166 - to ban hunting. That verdict should now be accepted unless and until pro-hunters can help elect a parliament that will remove the ban. With all its faults, that is the right system. In the end, the majority must have the right to make laws, and the minority must accept the responsibility to obey them.</p>",
  "Chris Patten has always had a colourful turn of phrase, and he treated the European parliament to a few well-chosen ones about transatlantic relations yesterday. The man who livened up Conservative politics with language like \"gobsmacked\" and \"double whammy\" told MEPs that a combination of \"testosterone and superciliousness\" was not an adequate way of approaching grave global problems. Diplomatic to a fault, the EU's outgoing commissioner for external relations did not spell out who he meant, though he did note pointedly that Americans and Europeans deserved better. The irritation he has occasionally caused in George Bush's Washington is evidence of the same bullish political courage he once showed as the last colonial governor of Hong Kong. <p>Mr Patten now has just a few weeks left before he ends his five-year term on Romano Prodi's team in Brussels and heads for a quieter life as chancellor of Oxford University. He has repeatedly argued that Europe needs to do much more to get its act together on the world stage, and can point to some success in the Balkans, though not in many other places. Progress, he admitted, had been made by \"lurches and shuffles\" rather than leaps and bounds. He has also rightly asked what a Europe that is unhappy with rampant US unilateralism is prepared to actually do if and when the use of force is required. \"How,\" as he put it in Strasbourg, \"do we intend to go about not just draining the swamps in which terrorism breeds but also shooting some of the crocodiles?\" But neither Russia nor Israel, he observed, should violate human rights in their legitimate fight against terrorism. </p> <p>The most committed pro-European Tory of his generation reserved his most scathing words for the US-led and British-backed war on Iraq. \"Liberation rapidly turned into a brutally resisted occupation,\" he said. \"Democracy failed to roll out like an oriental carpet across the thankless deserts of the Middle East.\" Such honest and articulate good sense must not be allowed to disappear from the European political scene.</p>",
  "After yesterday's vote it now looks all but certain that a ban on hunting will come into force, probably in 18 months' time. The bill heads for the Lords today, where it is likely to be rejected, but the Parliament Act will be applied to force it into law. <p>Even when it is in place, foxes are still likely to be tracked down and shot by farmers and, perhaps, by hunts. Various methods of eradication, such as using bright lights to flush out foxes - known as lamping - will still be legal. </p> <p>The experience of Scotland illustrates the difficulties ahead, although legislation north of the border differs in some areas. The Scottish ban came into force more than two years ago and represents an uneasy compromise between animal rights activists and hunting enthusiasts. </p> <p>Foxes are still killed in Scotland and, surprisingly, nine of the country's 10 mounted hunts have survived because dogs can still be used to flush out foxes. Crucially, a dog cannot kill its prey because the law stipulates a fox must be shot. Police say the law is difficult to enforce. </p> <p>The Scottish Countryside Alliance claims the number of people involved in hunting has fallen by more than a half. </p> <p>In England and Wales, the alliance has claimed that around 15,000 jobs are at risk, although an inquiry by the former Treasury permanent secretary, Lord Burns, put the number at half this. </p> <p>Professor Neil Ward, director of Newcastle University's Centre for Rural Economy, and a government adviser, estimates that up to 700 people are employed directly by more than 300 hunts in England and Wales, with between 1,500 and 3,000 in related equestrian businesses. </p> <p>He disputes that all these jobs would be lost since workers would still be needed to service alternative country pursuits. </p> <p>\"We have to remember more jobs are being created in the countryside than in urban areas - 1m in the last 20 years alone,\" he said. </p> <p>Delaying implementing the legislation is intended to provide a breathing space so that workers have time to find alternative jobs. </p> <p>The prime minister's stand on the issue seems to rest with his uneasy relationship with the parliamentary Labour party, and promises made to backbench MPs when his position appeared more fragile this summer. </p> <p>Privately, some Labour MPs are surprised by the sudden reappearance of the issue, seven years after a private bill from the backbencher Michael Foster was backed by the Commons but killed by Downing Street. </p> <p>In July 1999, Tony Blair surprised his party by telling the BBC Question Time programme that legislation to outlaw hunting was back on the agenda. But he then backed away from a ban - only to change tack again the following year. In January 2001, MPs voted for a ban only to find a bill blocked in the Lords. </p> <p>The 2001 Labour manifesto promised another free vote, but nothing was heard until the following year when the prime minister promised he would honour his pledge to hold a free vote. Again the Commons voted for a ban and the Lords vetoed one. Alun Michael then announced a six-month consultative process on new proposals. </p> <p>The government appeared to think it had Commons backing for a compromise option of regulated fox hunting, but more pressing matters, particularly the build-up to the war in Iraq, intervened.</p>",
  "Police across the country are braced for a wave of protests in the wake of the ban on fox hunting. <p>Hunt followers are planning demonstrations, road blocks and other direct action which could stretch security resources in rural areas. </p> <p>But police chiefs vowed last night to do whatever it takes to enforce the law. </p> <p>Alastair McWhirter, the Suffolk chief constable and Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on rural policing, said: \"Whatever legislation parliament passes will be enforced by the police. </p> <p>\"Those who are currently proposing civil disobedience in response to a change in legislation need to fully understand that we will take action. However difficult that legislation turns out to be to enforce, the police will enforce it.\" </p> <p>He refused to discuss tactics. But after the fuel protests in 2000, Acpo and the Home Office set up a special review group to provide prompt aid by other forces around the country in the event of major protests and blockades, and similar plans will probably be put in place. </p> <p>If the depth of feeling in the villages around Petworth, on the West Sussex and Surrey border and home to the biggest hunt in south-east England, is indicative of other hunting strongholds, the police may face big problems. </p> <p>Tree trunks carried \"no to the ban\" posters, villagers wore their British Field Sports badges and Liberty and Livelihood T-shirts with pride, as others gathered round televisions in local pubs to cheer on the protests in Westminster. </p> <p>The hunt kennels at Petworth House were abandoned as every kennel maid, secretary, stablehand and huntsman travelled to London for the rally. </p> <p>Hunt followers are plotting direct action and many have schemes to circumvent the law. \"There is going to be a battle,\" said Hamish Hiddleston, landlord of The Stag, in Balls Cross. \"The countryside is very angry. There was a plan to block the M1 and M25 yesterday, but it was shelved at the last minute. We'll probably do that when the bill goes to the Lords.\" </p> <p>Many locals believe the ban is just another assault on an already struggling countryside. </p> <p>Dick Ide-Smith, an 84-year-old retired major, declared: \"I've been a member of the British Field Sports Society since 1930 when they first attempted a ban on stag hunting. We defeated them then and we will do it again this time.\"</p>",
  "The Countryside Alliance, which has portrayed itself as a champion of freedom and respect for the law, was forced to disown some members last night after protests inside and outside the Commons badly damaged its credibility. <p>Ironically, the organisation, whose supporters range from landowners to the Labour peer Lady Mallalieu, runs the risk of being labelled militant. By contrast, in a remarkable role reversal, anti-hunting groups, from the RSPCA to the League Against Cruel Sports, were taking the high moral ground. </p> <p>\"We are disgusted at this display by the pro-hunt lobby, showing utter disregard for democracy,\" said John Rolls, the RSPCA's director of animal welfare protection. \"They have had every opportunity to present evidence to parliament ... those in favour of hunting have failed to win the argument and must now accept the will of parliament.\" </p> <p>Douglas Batchelor, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the pro-hunt lobby had failed to justify its \"dreadful\" sport. \"Its arguments have been demolished. The hunters must now ... abide by the law of the land, and stop demonstrating an intolerable contempt for democracy.\" </p> <p>Phyllis Campbell McRae, director of the Interna tional Fund for Animal Welfare, added: \"Our hunt monitors have braved threats and abuse on a daily basis to expose the cruelty and barbarity of this practice. Hunters must now heed the will of parliament and the electorate.\" </p> <p>The alliance was left with no alternative other than to confirm that \"some\" of the Commons infiltrators came from its organisation. But the pro-hunting group maintained: \"They were acting as individuals ... we condemn the demonstration which was selfish and self-indulgent and took away from the actions of 20,000 law-abiding protesters.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Simon Hart, chief executive, added: \"The scenes of dis ruption in Westminster are unfortunate and unnecessary, but when the Labour party is destroying people's lives in some perverted game of political football, they are not surprising.\" </p> <p>He was careful to qualify his condemnation, adding that the government must share some of the blame. \"We do not condone law-breaking of any kind, but Alun Michael [rural affairs minister] inflamed the situation by admitting that the government is banning hunting as part of some sort of political game.\" </p> <p>Mr Michael was puzzled by this assertion, arguing that the government had been forced to act after repeated attempts to block anti-hunting bills in the Lords.</p>",
  "The storming of the floor of parliament was not a spur-of-the-moment act of protest, but part of an elaborate and well-planned move, involving the son of a rock star, a dummy run the day before, bogus letters and the clothes of construction contractors. <p>The BBC and, possibly, other news organisations were tipped off about the plans the day before, and yet, extraordinarily, no one told parliament's limited security forces. </p> <p>It now appears that the group of eight hunters, many members of the Countryside Alliance and including Otis Ferry, the son of former Roxy Music star Brian Ferry, had planned this invasion of democracy for days. </p> <p>The big question is how they were given so much knowledge about the layout of the building, the best corridor by corridor access route to the chamber and how to lie their way into relevant areas of the Commons. Someone told the group that the select committee corridor floor was in a state of reconstruction and that they should pretend they were going to a committee meeting as construction workers. Allegations that the culprit was a researcher of a prominent Tory MP were denied by the Tories last night. </p> <p>The group arrived as white-collar construction workers, armed with a forged letter suggesting they had been asked to a meeting on construction by two MPs, Kerry Pollard and Sir Peter Tapsell. Neither MP had any knowledge of the letter, but Mr Pollard does have a construction background, so someone with a good inside take suggested using Mr Pollard's name. </p> <p>With the Commons closed to lobbyists, the group lied their way past unsuspecting police, and scanners. They reached the normally readily accessible select committee corridor and went into one of the rooms to take off their construction clothes, revealing anti-hunt ban white T-shirts, before rushing down a little-known staircase that took them to the back of Speaker's chair and a means of access to the chamber. </p> <p>The area should be one of the most protected in Westminster since most senior Cabinet ministers have offices in the immediate vicinity. It appears that a door that should have been accessible only with a swipe card available to Commons staff had been left open by the police, partly to make it easier for MPs to rush to a vote. </p> <p>The first signs that the Westminster protest as MPs voted to ban hunting was going to be something other than routine came mid-afternoon, when hundreds of demonstrators surged against lines of baton-wielding police. Within minutes, bloodied protesters were pitted against officers in riot gear, in scenes that could have come from the 1980s miners' strike. </p> <p>Police helicopters hovered low over the Treasury building beside Parliament Square, and a folk singer on the platform had just finished his refrain: \"Fight, fight for your rights, the war has begun\", when the first thunderflash was thrown. </p> <p>There was a rush towards the police and a barrage of objects was hurled, including old sandwiches and plastic bottles, causing officers to draw their batons. </p> <p>More explosions followed, caused by crow scarers and fireworks. Placards were hurled. Officers struck out at a small section of the crowd trying to push through to the House of Commons. </p> <p>Some protesters were arrested and dragged away. Others staggered back, blood pouring from their heads. </p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Sam Owen, from Pontypool in south Wales, with blood streaming down the side of his face, said: \"I was six or seven rows back but the police came out and hit us.\" Stink bombs and coloured smoke canisters were thrown as officers brought out riot shields and wielded batons. Shotgun cartridges, loaded only with powder, were detonated, adding to the cacophony of blaring horns and whistles. </p> <p>\"A lot of people are going to lose their jobs and their hounds,\" said Alison Auvray, from Lambourn, Berkshire. \"There are a lot of people who felt very strongly.\" </p> <p>Then suddenly, just after 4pm, the focus switched to the floor of the Commons, where the debate on the hunting bill was nearing its conclusion. </p> <p>Eight protesters were already inside the Palace of Westminster by then, making their way, apparently unnoticed and unchecked until the last moment, through the maze of corridors leading over and around the chamber. </p> <p>Westminster security sources said they approached their target from the committee corridor - a long passage running the entire length of the palace from Lords to Commons above the chambers of the two houses. </p> <p>The first protester stood alongside the Opposition frontbench, gesturing and shouting across the despatch box at the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, as another three protesters ran in after him, shouting pro-hunting slogans. </p> <p>A fifth ran down the No lobby, turned back and burst in at the other end of the chamber, pursued by security staff in tailcoats, one carrying a ceremonial stick. </p> <p>A tussle compared by one observer with the \"Keystone cops\" followed, amid shouts of \"get out\" from Labour MPs, and deputy speaker Sylvia Heal suspended the sitting. </p> <p>\"This looks like an inside job,\" one former minister said last night. \"Even if they found a route that didn't require a pass to open doors, they would have needed someone to lead them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Few of us, I think, would rejoice in having a person in Batman suit for a father. Particularly when the twerp in question has a record for harrassing the mother of two of his children and was allegedly overheard, more recently, bragging about the prodigious number of women to have enjoyed the favours bulging to one side of his Batman knickers. And yet Jason Hatch of Fathers4Justice has got himself quite a distinguished following. </p> <p>Yesterday, in these pages, Hatch and his comrades were even likened to the suffragettes. Who obviously missed a trick in not going in for fancy dress. For although F4J's children's party costumes are sometimes deprecated by those who go on to approve its campaign, it seems unlikely that anyone would have warmed to the men, even taken much notice, had they performed their various feats in civvies. In ill-fitting, babyish outfits that contrived to make them look more little-guyishly plucky (or creepy) than oikish, they elicited support and admiration from the most unlikely places. </p> <p>Bob Geldof, meanwhile, thinks them \"great and brave\". One of our leading young historians urges them on. Even the law-abiding Daily Mail can't resist this nifty new angle for getting one over on women, whose intransigence has apparently created \"these men driven to desperate measures to get their stories heard\". </p> <p>Although one could easily get the impression that the main reason for the stories is to get the desperate measures on telly. If we didn't know, from numerous interviews, that Hatch has the interests of two of his children at heart, his penchant for sneaking up, or into, forbidden places might look more like a hobby than a cause. In another era, perhaps he and his mates would simply have gone out poaching or ratting, grumbling about bloody women along the way. </p> <p>Today, for men who crave camaraderie and thrills but can't afford to go shark-fishing or bungee jumping, Fathers4Justice presents itself as inexpensive, all-male extreme sport, with the added frisson that comes of its also being a crusade and a covert operation. If only more of its members were still cohabiting, it would be a brilliant way of getting away from her indoors. \"Could you change the baby, dearest?\" \"Sorry love, the lads are expecting me on Clifton Suspension Bridge. Where's my Batman suit?\" </p> <p>(Actually, it seems that Hatch, last seen acknowledging the crowds from one of her majesty's ledges, is already in the doghouse. Gemma Polson, the mother of their seven-month-old daughter, has reportedly left him, and says: \"Fathers4Justice has taken over his life. He had told me he was going to give it all up - but then he goes and does this at Buckingham Palace.\" If only he had chosen angling.) </p> <p>Naturally, the ambitions of Fathers4Justice go beyond seeking satisfaction for its premier activists. On its website, the organisation introduces itself as \"a new civil rights movement campaigning for a child's right to see both parents and grandparents\". Which would not be such a bad idea, if the rights in question weren't going to be enforced by warring adults. And there is, it turns out, a reason why F4J is not called P&amp;G4J. In practice, \"parents and grandparents\" turns out to mean a \"dad's army\" which the organisation has been, as it puts it, \"mobilising\" to fight the authorities which support \"recalcitrant mothers\". </p> <p>Remarkably little evidence is produced to account for this declaration of war. While it is true that some mothers behave vengefully and deny their children's best interests, there is nothing to support the view that such behaviour is either prevalent, or officially approved. On the contrary. A new government green paper, \"Parental separation: children's needs and parents' responsibilities\", notes that most \"non resident-parents\" have weekly or more frequent meetings with their children. It finds that in around 90% of cases, child contact arrangements have been agreed informally by separated parents, of whom, more than 80% profess themselves happy with the arrangement. This does not, in short, conform with the F4J blighted vision of \"a nation of children without parents and parents without children\". </p> <p>In reality, where there is dissatisfaction with the arrangement this is often because the resident parent - usually the mother - thinks there has been too little, not too much, contact with the the father. If F4J's main concern is genuinely that children should see both their parents, it has launched its dads' army at the wrong sex. </p> <p>Compared with the number of men who say they want but are denied contact, says Gwen Vaughan, the chief executive of Gingerbread, \"there are far more fathers who have no contact with their children whatsoever\". The men have dropped out of their children's lives. \"The idea that mothers are bleeding fathers dry and refusing them access is certainly not the main picture that we see,\" she says. \"They would like more, not less, supportive parenting involvement from their ex partners.\" </p> <p>If Fathers4Justice is happy to rest much of its case on anecdotes told by individual, often justifiably embittered members, it is surely reasonable to point out that there are many other stories to be told, in which mothers heroically put aside their personal feelings about unreliable, abusive, violent, or possibly criminal former partners purely for the sake of their children. There are more in which fathers, for all that they claim to have their children's interests at heart, use the courts to prosecute a feud with an ex-partner. </p> <p>Since children are not, as Lord Falconer has pointed out, to be divided up like CD collections, it is not terribly surprising that when these cases go to court many more parents profess themselves unhappy with the outcome. They must have been pretty unhappy before they got there. Those of us who have never been through one of these ghastly battles like to point out, the more piously the better, that such parents really ought to put personal animosity aside. But if they can't, the courts will have to do it for them; occasionally deciding that shared parenting, in this battleground, may no longer be the best outcome. Even so, where parents go to court for contact, only 0.8% are refused. But this sort of objection is unlikely to make much difference to the F4J men's approval ratings, at least while mothers seem so reluctant to dress up as cartoon figures and throw purple condoms at people. </p> <p>Still, we can agree with Mr Hatch and his gang on one thing: the children's interests should come first. Which means all the fathers in themed romper suits must get down from the walls immediately, stop showing off, and behave nicely. And what goes for them goes for everyone who has been encouraging this silly nonsense. At their age, they really should know better. </p> <p><strong>Back on song, Blair tries to woo us back</strong></p> <p>Whatever the TUC felt about the content of Mr Blair's address to them on Monday, they should surely feel flattered to have been the beneficiaries of what seems to me to have been, if not one of the great Blair speeches, certainly a hint that we may expect, come conference, a return to glorious, shameless form. The glimpse of a Blair in full song was there not only in his bold reworking of Shakespeare - \"I come here to praise Warwick not bury it. To advocate social partnership not belittle it\" - but in a plangent bit of phrasing that seems to be his very own: \"Even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back.\" </p> <p>Assuming Mr Blair did not copy this off the inside of a greetings card with a little bear on the front holding a pale blue balloon and saying \"Sorry!\", it suggests an intriguing new shift in his rhetorical style, from the visionary who gave us a \"new young country\" to a sadder but wiser kind of guy who hopes we can learn to love again. </p> <p>A bit like Steps in Since You Took Your Love Away: \"I need to find a way back, And I don't know if I'm strong enough ... You took your love, oh baby, no I need you.\" Could Blair's TUC phrase even be a quote from one of his own, as yet unpublished, songs? \"Even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back, ooh yeah baby, Even if we used to disagree, There's nothing I can do about Iraq, I'm sorry baby ...\" Can't wait.</p>",
  "<p>There is a hidden killer out there. It will end the lives of more than 2,000 Britons a year in a terrible, painful way - and you may be only metres away from the cause, even as you read this. </p> <p>It is called mesothelioma. For sufferers, it is a death sentence. But compared with diseases such as breast cancer, there is little in the way of public campaigning over the condition, or more than fractional funding of research into it. Now, surgeons are divided over a radical new solution, soon to be trialled. But it has raised an ethical question: is it better to conduct a major operation, which might lengthen life but risks killing the patient, or is it better just to ease the patient's passage to the grave? </p> <p>The only certainty is the cause: asbestos. A mineral once seen as a natural wonder for its insulation and fireproof qualities, the stuff is everywhere in Britain: in our homes, schools, hospitals, workplaces. Properly sealed, it should be harmless, but if fibres become airborne and are then inhaled, the results can be disastrous. Asbestos is banned now, but more than 500,000 non-domestic buildings still have it.</p> <p>The warning from cancer experts is that 100,000 people in the developed world will die a painful death, lungs constricted by an ever hardening lining. The symptoms (trouble breathing, unexplained chest pain), will have only started a few months before, but the tiny beginnings may have been laid 15, 25, even 50 years before. Exposure is usually occupational, in shipyards or building. But, increasingly, there are DIY casualties, or relatives who inhaled fibres while washing clothes. </p> <p>The trouble is, no one is quite sure how mesothelioma develops. It may start when an inhaled fibre penetrates through to the mesothelial cells of the lung lining - known as the pleura. Macrophages, a type of immune cell, attack the inflamed tissue. Unfortunately, they are ill-equipped to deal with the fibre: they get damaged and spit the asbestos out. This process also damages the mesothelial cells of the pleura, which can start dividing uncontrollably and develop into a tumour pressing down on the lung. It's different to asbestosis - a better-known lung condition which comes from years of exposure. </p> <p>For mesothelioma theoretically one fibre inhaled is enough to cause the damage. Blue and brown asbestos is thought to be the most dangerous, although white has also been linked. By 2015 to 2020, some 2,000 people in this country will be dying annually from mesothelioma, say specialists. In contrast, the Health and Safety Executive thinks that the peak may come earlier and be nearer 2,500. Other countries are expecting rising deaths, although the US may be past the peak because of earlier action against asbestos. In the developing world, where imports continue, the prognosis is grim. </p> <p>David Waller, of Glenfield hospital, Leicester, says patients do not get referred to specialists such as himself be cause they are originally seen by non-surgeons, doctors who hold to \"the generally held belief ... that this condition is untreatable\". He adds: \"Patients have been told by physicians in good faith, but in ignorance really, that nothing can be done for them.\" </p> <p>The debate among the few doctors who specialise in mesothelioma is split between those who believe in radical surgery and those who favour more conservative options. The radical operation, extrapleural pnuemonectomy, involves removing the damaged lung and much that surrounds it. </p> <p>Interest has surged, not least in patients informed by the internet, because of the work in the late 1990s of a Boston surgeon, David Sugarbaker. He reported survival figures of up to 48% at five years. Waller is a lead investigator in a pilot study, involving 50 patients, to be launched this autumn to assess the surgery. It will ultimately involve about 700 patients across Europe. Few surgeons in Britain now perform the operation. \"I must probably do 70% of all the major operations for this condition,\" says Waller.</p> <p>The surgery takes about three hours. Most tumours seem to be on the right side so the breast bone is split down the middle, and the whole lung is removed with its lining, the sac round the heart (the pericardium) and the diaphragm - the muscle between the lung and the abdomen. That is replaced with a prosthetic patch, as is the pericardium. </p> <p>In the trial, patients will be randomised into receiving the surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or more minor surgery, chemotherapy and less radiotherapy. \"The problem is going to be convincing patients to agree to be randomised. Some patients will have a clear idea they want surgery,\" he says. \"We are not gung-ho. We turn down more patients than we operate on ... I tell them I can't cure them, right up front, because some of them come with unrealistic aspirations - that it is some kind of miracle surgery we are offering. It will come back in areas of the body I can't control by surgery. But our longest survivor is coming to four years from surgery, so we can offer a period of borrowed time they would not have otherwise, with a relatively good quality of life. </p> <p>\"I tell them to go and make the best of that time, and we have patients doing just that. They have cashed in insurance policies, and gone away to enjoy the last three or four years of their life rather than be told nothing can be done, they have to sit at home and wait for the grim reaper. I have a chap who climbed a mountain since he had his operation.\" </p> <p>In a study Waller made of patients who did not have radical surgery, the average survival between diagnosis and death was six months \"and, don't forget, that is not six months and then die suddenly but with a terminal phase of three to four months in pain, being slowly asphyxiated\". </p> <p>Others, however, are less enthusiastic about the operation. Andrew Ritchie, a surgeon at Papworth hospital, Cambridge, hopes to involve patients in the trials but says the results might not prove anything and that it will take years. \"It is a big operation for which initial mortality was very high although over the last five to 10 years that has come down to more reasonable levels. But you always need chemotherapy and radiotherapy, too. It cannot clear the whole tumour out ... It is only suitable, if at all, for highly selected early-stage patients. Most are at late stage, frail and elderly and are no way ever going to be fit enough for an operation like that.\" </p> <p>Ritchie says presentation does not always take decades. He has seen patients who have been exposed to asbestos only a few years before. \"Making a diagnosis is extremely difficult even when a pathologist has tissue under a microscope. You can have benign conditions which cause excessive fluid in the lung cavity, causing shortness of breath. Other diseases are infectious. You don't want to give a patient a wrong terminal prognosis.\" </p> <p>The palliative surgery he promotes offers an alternative to procedures dealing with fluid around the lung. Cells in a healthy lining produce small amounts of lubricant so the lung can expand during breathing without it catching on the chest wall. Disease causes either an overproduction of the fluid or stops it recycling as it becomes \"a pleural effusion\". The problem is common in mesothelioma, though not unique to it. \"Tapping the fluid off by inserting a needle through the chest wall can give immediate relief but fluid rapidly accumulates once more,\" says Ritchie. Patients need repeated trips to hospital, and the treatment might actually help spread the tumour and introduce bacterial infection. </p> <p>Doctors have tried to beat this problem by infusing talc in the hope that it can \"stick\" the lung up to the chest wall, but this too rarely works because the lung is bound by the tumour. </p> <p>Ritchie devised a keyhole operation that is now to be measured in trials against the talc procedure. This is designed to deal with fluid and get the lung moving once more. It also removes parts of the tumour. He says this can be done in one hospital visit and is \"suitable for the vast majority of patients who are elderly, frail and sick\". \"Patients live on average for 18-22 months when they would expect to die in four to nine months.\" </p> <p>But it is extremely difficult to tell what stage of the disease patients are at, even after mesothelioma is diagnosed. All the patients involved in the keyhole procedure are \"clearly pretty near the end of their journey\", whereas those undergoing more radical surgery cannot be reliably placed, he says. </p> <p>As the debate about surgery continues, national trials involving different types of chemotherapy are also under way. The received wisdom has been that none is very effective, but the newest arrival is not even involved in the comparative tests, partly because there was little known about it when the trials were prepared. </p> <p>Pemextred, made by Eli Lilly with the brand name Alimpta, is licensed in the US and the company hopes to introduce it in Europe soon. Hopes have been raised for its use in conjunction with an existing treatment, and patients here already receive it on compassionate grounds. </p> <p>Hilary Calvert, professor of medical oncology at Newcastle University and a consultant at Newcastle general hospital, was involved in a trial. Of the 25 who completed the study, eight responded to treatment with a large reduction in size of tumour. Of other patients who did not get 50% shrinkage, about 70% saw improvement in symptoms, less pain and improved breathing. Calvert has now treated about 100 patients with the drug. </p> <p>Eli Lilly found median survival time increased by about three months. \"That does not sound much, but nothing else had increased median survival time at all,\" says Calvert. \"Some patients on it will survive for quite a few years. We have one who has survived for four or five. For something that is meant to be a lethal disease, that is quite a good result.\" </p> <p>The drug stops cells dividing and its biology may make it more powerful still. \"It is an analogue for folic acid, essential for the dividing of cells. It may be that Alimpta might be drawn into mesothelioma cells more rapidly than other cells. The tumour says 'Oh good, folic acid. I need that' and then realises it is more like a Trojan horse.\" </p> <p>Will these new attempts to treat the disease be enough? Ken O'Byrne, former head of the British Mesothelioma Interest Group, who now works at St James's hospital, Dublin, is scathing about the lack of research money poured into the disease compared with, say, breast cancer. \"People think it will pass away. It has often been perceived as a disease of older working-class men and historically they tend not to get the best deal.\" </p> <p>The asbestos sub-committee of the all-party Parliamentary group on occupational safety and health wants a national strategy, says John Battle, Labour MP for Leeds West. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago, we were all saying 'You have HIV or Aids, you die.' Now, not only can we extend life, we can mitigate the worst effects so people don't suffer appallingly. With mesothelioma, people die a terrible death in agony. We can't leave them to suffer alone.\" </p> <p><strong>Further reading</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cancerbacup.org.uk/Cancertype/Mesothelioma\">Background information on the cancer and the medical trials</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/328/7434/237\">Radical Surgery for Mesothelioma, by Tom Treasure, David Waller et al, BMJ 2004</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.marf.org\">Useful US website run by the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mesothel.com\">US website accumulating medical reports, survivor's tales and latest news</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,13026,1305109,00.html\">Read David Fickling's report on the latest in mesothelioma research</a></p>",
  "<p> <strong> The Sims 2</strong> <br> PC, \u00a339.99 Maxis/EA,<br> ***** </p> <p> The sequel to the biggest selling PC game ever is here and it is an absolute treat. As before, this is all about taking control of your own Sims, building them a home, finding them a job and showing them how to clean up. </p> <p>But The Sims 2 takes the concept to the next level. This time you direct your Sims over their lifetime, from baby to \"senior\", and can pass on their genes to future generations. This lifetime attachment is also expressed by aspirations and fears. </p> <p>Players still have to hold their Sim's hand to wash up or shower, but these elements have been downgraded in place of deeper concerns. So younger Sims may want to be read to, and not be shouted at; older Sims may want to attract the eye of a handsome neighbour or avoid being discovered by their wife while cheating with the maid. </p> <p>The vastly improved graphics, which let you zoom in on your characters, show off the full range of new expressions and, more importantly, make you really care about your Sim. </p> <p>Whereas before an upset Sim would seem a vaguely comic matter, it becomes a pressing issue when viewed up close. And that's the key: you do care about your Sims, especially when they age and (sob) die. </p> <p>Throw in an even more comprehensive house design and decorating function, a game-in-itself Sim creation section, and the ability to record movies and you have a fantastic achievement. The Sims 2 has raised the gaming bar. <br> <strong> Greg Howson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Evil Genius</strong> <br> PC, \u00a334.99 Elixir Studios/VU Games,<br> **** <br></p> <p> \"Everybody wants to rule the world,\" sang Tears for Fears. Nearly 20 years later, Elixir Studios turns that statement into virtual reality in Evil Genius, a game where players assume the role of a Bond-style villain on the rocky path to world domination. </p> <p>Being an evil dictator takes hard work. You'll have to recruit a horde of minions to build up a base, while your evil avatar spends time practising a maniacal laugh. With your base established, you have to ensure your operations go global. </p> <p>This means using your control room - the hub of your evil empire - to gain information from around the world. Then you will be able to train the minions and send them out on special acts of infamy, which include capturing hostages, stealing loot and generally causing havoc. </p> <p>As your plans start to succeed, you attract the attention of nations, which will try to thwart your plans with spies and agents. Fiendish traps and torture devices are needed. </p> <p>Evil Genius has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour that permeates the gameplay, and it's packed with details and well-constructed missions. <br> <strong> Rhianna Pratchett </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Conflict: Vietnam</strong> <br> PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, \u00a339.99 Pivotal/SCi, <br> *** <br> The rivalry between publishers is illustrated by the arrival of the latest Vietnam-set instalment of the impressive Conflict series of third-person shoot-'em-ups, hot on the heels of Eidos's Shellshock Nam '67. </p> <p>For those who have been thrown into a sea of indecision, fear not. Conflict: Vietnam is easily the superior. But even so, it is far from perfect. Sensibly, it takes a squad-based approach: you control a team of four men undertaking a series of increasingly hairy missions, amid an accurate rendition of the hell that was the Vietnam war. It offers plenty of opportunities for hard-bitten digitised video scene-setting influenced by films such as Apocalypse Now. </p> <p>The series' perfectly honed squad-control system provides the high point: switching between players is wonderfully intuitive and easily performed even if you are under fire, and the ability to heal squad members at death's door is handy. The missions are varied and believable, and avoid the trap of side-stepping the horror of the war. The console versions sport a handy targeting system that snaps to the nearest enemy, which is essential, since the more accurate shooting view, with gun held up to your eye, is unusable. </p> <p>A huge gun combines with an annoyingly low third-person view, which means you can rarely see oncoming enemies. This is a surprising flaw, given that Pivotal has made several Conflict games. At least the game has a highly appealing cooperative multiplay option. However, Conflict: Vietnam is not an essential purchase. <br> <strong> Steve Boxer </strong> </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Keep up with the latest from the world of games with our Gamesblog, at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/games\">theguardian.com/games</a></p>",
