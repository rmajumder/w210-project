  "<p>'She doesn't know the first thing about the subject! And she's so petty! So up her own ...\" As I walk into the loo, my colleagues stop their conversation abruptly. They look guilty. Are they talking about me? They are talking about me. \"You're not talking about me, are you?\" I brazen it out with a laugh, sort of. </p> <p>They reassure me that of course not! It's someone else they're taking a hatchet to, but someone I'm friends with, so that's why they shut up so quickly. They don't sound entirely convincing. </p> <p>That's the thing about conversations in the cloakroom. As soon as you begin to slice through someone's character, you can bet they'll walk in that second. And where more than one are gathered together in the loo, conversation always turns to the boss, the company and the faults thereof. Naturally the boss will walk in just then, even if she's never been seen before in the office bog (for some reason bosses seem to have extremely strong bladders, or perhaps they just don't share our wish to escape from the office at hourly intervals.) </p> <p>\"That girl I just saw was a total waste of time! Why does the agency keep sending us no-hopers?\" This will be spat out just as the unlucky subject emerges from the loo looking angry, as well she might. </p> <p>I once voiced the opinion that \"I thought Sharon was looking very tired this morning. And that new haircut makes her face look a bit fat, I thought. Shame she had it cut ...\" Yikes! Sharon walked in on \"had it cut\" so I added \"to size and then all went wrong, it's better to stick with wood floors really\". Nifty work there, I think you'll agree. </p> <p>The loo is also a refuge for visitors who pop in to renew makeup, check hair, swallow tranquillisers or \"rehearse\" - perhaps before they have a meeting with you or an interview. You'll probably guess it's them. But if your first meeting is over the sinks, applying lipstick, it's all rather awkward. \"I'm meeting Kelly Barnes? At 2? What's she like?\" \"She's a fantastic person. She's me.\" </p> <p>Loo etiquette also means being super-polite to people, even if you normally ignore them. There's lots of \"after you\" (with the hand towels, the mirrors, the loo itself, the hand-drying machine) and it's good to pay a lot of compliments. Never agree with anyone that, yes, they probably are looking older or fatter. </p> <p>If anyone's on the verge of tears, affect not to notice it. The last thing you should say is \"Is something wrong?\" - unless you want to have a door slammed in your face. Never put your arm round them. Best to just smile in a vague way, but above all feign ignorance of the emotional state. How I regret the times I've said to tearful colleagues \"Are you OK?\" as they sobbed in the ladies. \"No, I'm very much not OK!\" shouted one, and never spoke to me again. </p> <p>Sometimes it is actually the boss who's taking cover in the loo looking upset and angry. There's only one thing to do - nothing. Just leave. Quickly. As though you were just on the way out. Any support you offer, any sympathy will backfire; she won't want anyone around who has once witnessed her collapse. </p> <p>Here's a dilemma - you're in the cubicle and hear a \"confidential\" conversation. Could be about you, or a colleague, or the company. What do you do? Easy. Stay hidden until they've gone. Then start cackling with evil glee as you plot your rise to glory.</p>",
  "<p>It used to be an insane asylum called Bedlam, until 1930. The impressive Victorian building near London Bridge is now home to the Imperial War Museum, a memorial to the great conflicts of the 20th century, and to the experiences of those who were caught up in them. Exhibitions are regularly held there, but organising them is a complex operation. </p> <p>One of the current exhibitions is \"The Great Escape\" which shows how Allied prisoners of war coped with their incarceration and tells the story of some of the amazing escape attempts which they engineered from Stalag Luft 3 and Colditz. </p> <p>Penny Ritchie-Calder, head of exhibitions, says that they \"fast-tracked\" this particular exhibition in 10 months. Others can take as long as three years to come to fruition. \"This one began with a suggestion that we should mark the 60th anniversary of the great escape in a way which would appeal to all ages,\" says Ritchie-Calder. \"Escape is a great subject for children, provided it is treated in the right way. The idea was developed at a meeting between myself, Nigel Steel [chief historian], and the head of our public services division. There was a lot of discussion and planning done to see if it was viable.\" The discussions dealt not only with the content of the event but with how it was to be interpreted and displayed. \"In that sense, it is like a 3D story,\" she says. \"So we work with designers and brief them on the kinds of things we want to include.\" </p> <p>Sometimes, this can present problems. In this instance, it was the desire to use a replica of the Colditz glider the men built secretly in the camp and used in one of their bids for freedom. \"It would have taken up a lot of space, so the designers looked at how the POWs had constructed it in a small attic, which gave us the inspiration to squeeze ours into a similar space.\" </p> <p>When the plans for the exhibition are finalised, Nigel Steel, the museum's chief historian, gets to work. \"From previous work I've done in this area, I had a certain knowledge, but this was more specific,\" he says. \"I not only have to track down artefacts, but also background information for the exhibition texts and captions. I also traced veterans involved in escape attempts. This meant getting in touch with people like \"Jimmy\" James, one of the 76 who escaped via the tunnel in Stalag Luft 3, although 50 of the escapees were shot.\" James's account of the escape is kept at the museum and the man himself has been asked to give a lecture while the exhibition is on. </p> <p>For Steel, the National Archives at Kew, where they house briefs, papers, reports and case histories, were a vital resource. \"There is a huge amount of detail there, including papers relating to the war crimes trials that took place after the war when those who had killed the 50 escapees were tracked down.\" </p> <p>However, paper research cannot always suffice. So Steel flew to Poland to try and arrange for artefacts to be brought to London. While he was there, he took the opportunity to visit Colditz. \"What I really wanted to get across to the public was not just the details of the escapes, which were only one aspect of POW life, but how their daily lives revolved around getting enough food, making clothes and so on,\" Steel explains. He also wanted to convey to the public and children just how some of the ingenious plans - the famous Wooden Horse - were thought up and all the unsung preparation that was needed, like making compasses, maps and securing fake passports. </p> <p>The work, of course, does not end when the exhibits are brought together. The event then has to be brought to the attention of the public, press and media. This is where Rebecca Stephens enters the picture, as head of marketing and PR. \"I do get involved in discussions with Penny at the planning stage, because they want to know whether the project is marketable,\" she says. \"Obviously, this one is. So I read around the subject and discuss historical background with Nigel. The department I head has to identify our audience and work out all the promotional material. The exhibition title and branding are crucial. There also has to be a website to give people more information about the stories and exhibits on display.\" They also prepare biographies of the surviving veterans, and see if any of their individual stories can be used to promote the event in the press. As the opening approaches, Stephens also arranges for veterans to give interviews to the press and various radio and television programmes. </p> <p>An important feature of the exhibition is a replica Steve McQueen motorbike, used in the movie, The Great Escape. It is the first thing seen by visitors. But in fact, says Ritchie-Calder, \"the bike is a complete fiction which McQueen wanted to use in the film. So it was Hollywood working in its best interests. But it represents the whole mythology that has grown up around the subject of escape and is forever associated with the great escape in everyone's minds. But everything else in the exhibition is for real.\" </p> <p>Whilst this exhibition is now up and running, the team have been working on three more projects simultaneously. One might be tempted to quote the office cliche \"You don't have to be mad to work here, but it helps\" were it not for the fact that everything at the Imperial War Museum runs with almost military precision. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Great Escape is at the Imperial War Museum until the end of July, 2005.</p>",
  "<p>The term 'paralegal' is a relatively recent import. It's something of an umbrella term and covers those who used to be known as \"legal executives\" (people who had worked in solicitors firms for years and learned \"on the job\" rather than through formal channels), people who think they might want to work in the law but are not yet sure and, increasingly, those who are lawyers in other countries but who cannot work here in the same capacity until they have requalified in this jurisdiction. </p> <p>It is a common misconception that law graduates working as paralegals can parlay their job into a training contract. This is, in fact, a relatively rare occurrence but paralegaling is still undoubtedly an invaluable addition to your CV, proving your commitment to a legal career, teaching you practical skills that no amount of lecturing on the LPC can give you and making you a more attractive proposition to a prospective employer. For these reasons, another growing section of the paralegal population is made up of law students or graduates who have not yet secured a training contract but are looking to spend the time wisely while they search. </p> <p>So, that's who they are. But what do they actually do? As with most legal jobs, the answer naturally varies according to the size of the firm, the amount of experience under the individual's belt and the area of specialisation. But it encompasses everything from purely administrative tasks like photocopying, preparing trial bundles, monitoring data rooms (where documents are kept for parties on both sides of a merger or acquisition to come and peruse), taking notes at hearings and delivering documents to court, through to those which demand a pretty thorough knowledge of legal procedure and commercial practice, such as deciding which documents require disclosure in a corporate transaction, drafting contracts, taking witness statements in litigious matters or acting as a case manager, with responsibility for ensuring that work is delegated to appropriate people and that deadlines are always met. There is a lot of scope within the job to fulfil whatever potential you have. \"In the last few years, the whole concept of paralegaling has come on in leaps and bounds,\" says Emma Ineson, manager of specialist paralegal recruitment consultancy Prolaw. \"It's much better thought of because it now offers far more career prospects and can be taken to whole new levels.\" </p> <p>Good paralegals - those who may go on to senior positions which can carry salaries of up to \u00a340,000 a year - are those who are willing to work hard and occasionally put the additional hours in to see off large litigation cases, says Ineson. She also recommends \"not having an attitude about the quality of work you're asked to do but just be dedicated and able to get your head down and do it.\" Paralegal Rhymal Persad who works in the litigation department at City firm Mishcon de Reya agrees: \"You have to show you are committed to what you are doing. Every day can be different, but I actually like it busy - I think it beats sitting at a desk doing nothing.\" </p> <p>A good eye for detail helps too. \"Although it will all be checked by a solicitor, if you're drafting correspondence, proofreading documents, checking cross- references or making sure dates or exhibit numbers marry up, you need to pay attention and give it to them with as few mistakes as possible,\" says Persad. </p> <p>Some paralegals choose to enter into only short-term contracts - anything from a few months to just a few days, maybe to be an extra pair of hands on a very big court case or merger. \"They really suit people who aren't sure yet if they want to pursue the law,\" says Ineson. \"Or who don't want to be tied down and prefer to move around firms and different practice areas.\" Others prefer to stay in one place, and many firms are prepared to invest in training them to take on more and more interesting work. \"We've got a clerk who deals with all the civil procedure rules who is going to take us right the way through a specimen case from beginning to end,\" says Persad. \"So we'll know better how all the different parts we do fit together and understand better what we're doing.\" </p> <p>Not a bad philosophy for any job, perhaps.</p>",
  "<p>Along with vampires, bats and owls, <strong>James Whale</strong> (talkSPORT) is habitually a creature of the night. He does a Sunday-afternoon show, which I've never tuned into, but is best known for his late-night shows which make for exasperating and exhilarant listening in equal measure (this is a marked improvement on many of his talkSPORT colleagues who are just plain exasperating). </p> <p>On Friday morning, however, I listened to Whale sitting in for Mike Dickin on the station's mid-morning phone-in show. The slot, often slow, repetitive and rabidly right-wing in Dickin's hands, was livelier for the stand-in, however odd it was to hear Whale doing his free-wheeling, naughty and comically truculent thing at 10am. </p> <p>That's not to say that he doesn't have his rabid moments too. This is him, for example, on joyriding teenagers: \"Let's hang them outside petrol stations and lock their families away for 10 years.\" And this was his response to news that Surrey police are making men who urinate in public clean their mess up with a mop and bucket: \"Why the hell don't you just spray them [with CS gas] in the private parts?\" </p> <p>But the difference is that you can hear the wind-up in Whale's swagger. He also extends it across all matters, both serious and silly. In the last hour on Friday's show, a dentist was in the studio fielding calls from the audience. Surrounded by questions about root canals and gum disease, Whale was like a hyperactive child on a sugar rush. \"Eugh!\", he cried in the background, when the dentist referred to people happily eating \"gum against gum\" after losing their teeth. Then, on hearing that sedation is no longer provided free on the NHS, he threw himself with much gusto, into a pantomime strop. \"I'm going to stop paying my taxes!\", he frothed. \"Why should I pay for this ridiculous lack of treatment!\" </p> <p>Listening to him being polemical, partisan and hardly ever politically correct, it's clear, however much you disagree with him, what distinguishes Whale from many other grump-jocks. His is a stylish, unpredictable offering (I wasn't expecting him to lambast the British government for not doing more against Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe), and one that hovers playfully on the verge of self-parody. \"Tell me I'm wrong,\" he says to his audience, suddenly sounding as if he might listen, \"but I don't think I am.\" </p> <p>On Friday's breakfast show with <strong>Pete and Geoff</strong> (Virgin), there was much lovely, otherworldly musing on the did-Harry-cheat storm. The duo's humour is quietly shambolic, and a rare gem on a floundering station. They liked the fact that, of all the subjects Harry's teacher might have helped him at, it was art. Said Geoff: \"Is she giving him tracing paper?\"</p>",
  "<p>For a moment Sir Ray Tindle appeared a little unsure how many titles were sheltering in his nationwide newspaper stable. He settled in the end on 175, but his uncertainty doesn't indicate that he is losing the plot. Just the opposite: it is a sign of the volatility of his extraordinary empire. He is now overseeing one of the most innovative of newspaper experiments by launching a series of monthlies and they are coming on stream so fast that even the company chairman is bound to lose count. </p> <p>Anyway, it's quite clear that, at 78, Tindle is just as enthusiastic and positive about the newspaper business as he was when, as a soldier during the second world war, he launched his first paper on a troop ship. Explaining the philosophy behind his monthlies, he says: \"Wherever we do weeklies there is always surplus material available and we have the resources of our established papers so the overheads are minimal. </p> <p>\"The monthly papers also open up a new advertising market because there are some advertisers who can't afford to place ads every week. But they might do so on a monthly basis.\" </p> <p>He believes that the monthlies, using the titles Diary, will complement the weeklies and also head off the attentions of any possible competitor. </p> <p>Meanwhile, his empire continues to grow by acquisition. In recent months he has added titles in Somerset and Devon along with a Welsh language paper, Y Cymro, which - unlike all his other papers - is a national. </p> <p>For Tindle, small is truly beautiful and profitable. He is one of the foremost advocates of local papers being as local as possible. It is an approach which has also paid dividends for Sir Nicholas Hewitt's Barnsley Chronicle and Charles Curry's New Milton Advertiser &amp; Lymington Times. </p> <p>Tindle, who likes to recite the mantra \"no names means no news\", once counted 2,000 names in Curry's paper. \"I was so impressed I sent him a silver cup as a tribute\", he says and, warming to the theme, adds: \"Even if I thought that, say, the Farnham Herald could add sales by moving into Guildford, I wouldn't approve. It would dilute the Farnham paper's coverage of Farnham. That's what makes it so popular\". He points out that the Herald was selling 23,000 when he bought it and is now nudging 30,000, and then reels off other examples, including the Tenby Observer which has increased from 3,700 to 7,000 over the past 25 years. That's a further illustration of Tindle's approach: he sees sales-building in the long term, nurturing papers as they slowly add circulation. </p> <p>Tindle is, of course, a businessman, but he sees himself primarily as a journalist, having started out on the now-defunct Croydon Times in 1947 in the typical dogsbody role of trainees at that time, doing everything. </p> <p>Using his army demob money he later bought the Tooting &amp; Balham Gazette for \u00a3250, transforming its fortunes so successfully that he was approached by a large group with a tempting offer. He turned them down twice but negotiated a deal on the third occasion which ended with his selling in return for three west London titles. It was the birth of the Tindle empire. </p> <p>Over the years, usually buying up titles which were about to close and thought to be unsaveable, and launching new titles - both paid-fors and frees - he has built up a business which has prospered through rigid cost-control and caution. Among the papers are wonderful titles, such as Pulman's Weekly News in Axminster, the Llan-twit Major Gem and the Forest of Dean and Wye Valley Review. Along the way Tindle also moved into radio and now owns seven commercial stations. </p> <p>He is much admired in the industry but, for a long time, other owners tended to think of him as a lovable eccentric because his papers seemed marginal and his profits appeared rather slim. Indeed, it took Tindle's group some 14 years to make its first \u00a32.5m profit and a further 14 to make the next \u00a32.5m. But it is expected that he will soon be able to announce that in just 12 months the company will record a bumper \u00a37.5m profit. Rivals have less to laugh about now. </p> <p>As a virtual one-man show, is Tindle worried about the future? He meets the question equably, pointing out that he was given five years to live eight years ago after being diagnosed with cancer of the throat. His larynx was removed and he now speaks through a device implanted in its place. </p> <p>\"I have no intention of leaving for a while\", he says. \"I'm fitter than I've ever been.\" </p> <p>He knows that the Tindle name will live on because his son, who runs his own business, is set to inherit. </p> <p>Tindle is not even thinking about retirement. He is concentrating on continuing to build his empire and nursing his monthly Diaries into health. Doubtless rival owners, including those running the big chains, will be watching very closely too.</p>",
  "<p>Advertising<br> </p> <p><strong> B for British in Baghdad</strong><br> Never mind the coalition troops capturing Iraq, now the BBC - mocked as the Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation by its critics - is hoping to liberate the country's airwaves by mounting a marketing strike. In an operation to ensure war-torn Iraqis are switched on to the BBC, they have erected a billboard in perhaps the most unlikely of locations - Baghdad. Perched on a rooftop in the midst of a bustling street in the commercial district, the hoarding urges commuters to turn their dials to the Arabic Service. However, it was no easy feat, taking months of protracted negotiations, complicated by the handover of power. Yet Al Mansour now joins the list of international locations being used to expand the BBC's global wares. \"The timing and location took months to negotiate,\" explains Jane Futrell, head of BBC World Service international marketing, \"but research proves our audience is growing rapidly on FM. There is a need for impartial international news and it is important people know how to access us.\" </p> <p>The 14 x 4 metre poster prominently features the slogan \"The World, Your News in Arabic\" and the BBC is optimistic that it can feed the voracious appetite for news and information in the current climate. With seven dedicated FM frequencies already boasting 3.3 million listeners, it hopes to expand its reach further in a country devoid of free and independent media for decades under Saddam Hussein, yet now home to a burgeoning news industry. </p> <p>This strategy of becoming the station of choice is aided by being the only international broadcaster to win permission for such a billboard. The media space was bought for an undisclosed figure through a Lebanese company, which negotiated with the Baghdad authorities, and is now hunting down additional sites throughout the country. With the BBC's distinctive side-on logo, the hoarding could prove a welcome sight for Westerners in the city, but is there a fear that it could become a target of anti-Western hostility? Futrell responds: \"I'm hoping not. All I can do is put it there, but I wouldn't want to do anything that would endanger anybody.\" </p> <p>However, Al Mansour has suffered from a number of fatal attacks recently and is where British hostage Ken Bigley was seized last month. There might not be many takers to live or work in a building shadowed by a four-metre high BBC logo.<br><strong>Rob Harris</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Press</strong> </p> <p><strong> Maximising exposure</strong><br> Viewers of television news bulletins last weekend would have seen undercover video footage of the Barcelona abortion clinic that featured in the Sunday Telegraph's splash that day. The footage supported their story - that the clinic offers illegal late abortions to women referred to it by the British Pregnancy Advice Service. But its existence also helped the story get a much better run on rolling news services such as Sky, as well as network news bulletins, than the typical newspaper investigative story that has only documents or audio recordings as evidence. </p> <p>The Sun employed a similar trick last month when reporter Anthony France smuggled a \"bomb\" into the Palace of Westminster, where he was working undercover as a waiter. Video of him assembling the device in a toilet was seen by millions of viewers on the late BBC and ITV bulletins after the paper's first edition hit the streets, with the Sun's logo prominently displayed at the top of the screen. </p> <p>The use of undercover video by television reporters is nothing new, but more newspapers - even quality titles - seem to be waking up to the technique as a way of maximising coverage of their big scoops. </p> <p>However, getting the masthead on television is not the prime motivation, according to Daniel Foggo, the Sunday Telegraph reporter who accompanied Charlotte Edwardes and shot the video using a specially adapted jacket equipped with a video camera and sound recording equipment. He says that video is concrete proof, should a story be contested in court: \"People cannot argue with it.\" It also seems to increase the story's credibility, Foggo adds. \"A story is believed more when people can see it on TV.\" <br><strong>Chris Johnston </strong> </p> <p><strong> Television</strong> <br><strong> Could it happen here?</strong><br> If more than 62 million people watch a political debate instead of a soap or a reality show, is it good for the democratic process? Discuss ... While a fascinated America follows the ups and downs of the three-round John Kerry versus George Bush TV battle, what chance is there of UK leaders in a head-to-head? Polls show record levels of public disaffection, TV political coverage is largely marginalised, but Tony Blair's advice has been to steer clear, even though colleagues say \"something must be done\" about voter apathy. It looks as if America may have provided the answer, with 62.5 million tuning in for the first show down; 15 million more than watched the last-ever episode of Friends and 35 million more than the TV audience for the Oscars. It's also 40% more than watched the Bush-Gore debate of 2000, suggesting that September 11, the war on terror and Iraq have heightened political awareness and increased the appetite for mainstream, prime-time political specials that are not required by law; Bush and Kerry took part voluntarily. </p> <p>So will a Blair, Howard and Kennedy roadshow be coming to your TV screen? The omens, so far, are not good. In 2001, ITV and BBC made a joint approach for leaders' debates. The Liberal Democrats said yes; the Conservatives said yes; and there was an encouraging grunt from Alastair Campbell who said he had a \"hunch\" that the debates would happen. However, late in the day, broadcasters were told that Blair had been advised he had nothing to gain from the exercise so it didn't happen. That decision was rewarded with a 59% turnout, the lowest number of voters in 80 years, but an even bigger parliamentary majority for Labour. </p> <p>For now, the Conservatives say they would welcome a debate: \"a healthy development for the British general election\", a spokesman said. The Liberal Democrats have always been in favour and say there's even more of case in 2005. As for Labour, senior sources remain sceptical saying it is unwise to draw parallels with the US. A spokesman said: \"All the evidence we have is that politicians standing head-to-head and attacking each other is exactly the sort of thing that voters do not want to see.\" <br><strong>Steve Anderson, the creative director of Mentorn TV, who led the ITV/BBC bid for a leaders' debate in 2001 </strong> </p> <p><strong> News agency</strong><br> <strong> Click-and-tell </strong><br> When attractive young women want to dish the dirt on their Saturday night encounters with worse-for-wear football players, they might normally be expected to turn to an agent like Max Clifford. But, according to a news agency based in Norfolk, members of the public with stories to tell are not as media savvy as the likes of Rebecca Loos, and are often wary about calling high-profile publicists or the newsdesks of tabloids. So the KNS agency has set up a website, cash4yourstory, to take advantage of the growing trend in kiss-and-tell stories - although it warns there is not as much money in it as some people think. Mark Houldy, the agency's news editor, says the idea for a website - which has been promoted with advertisements on the London underground - came from a desire to attract members of the public with stories to tell, but who are unsure of how to get them told. </p> <p>\"It has been worthwhile - we get on average about one contact a day from the website, and about half of them are inquiries that we can act on. There are a lot of people out there with stories and they don't know how to publicise them or get cash out of them.\" He adds that most people do not have much of an idea of how much a story is worth. They are used to seeing telephone-number figures discussed in the press, whereas few stories are worth more than a few thousand pounds and many only net a few hundred. Nevertheless, the first question callers tend to ask is \"How much?\" </p> <p>Houldy says he deals in a wide range of stories, including celebrity kiss-and-tell, unusual family circumstances and experiences, and whistleblowers. The agency has supplied stories such as \"You are intellectually inferior, TV Trisha tells Norfolk women\" (Daily Telegraph) and \"Tony Martin's personal police station\" (Daily Mail). Some of the agency's work is of a more worthy nature: Terry Fisher, co-ordinator of a pensioners' group in Bridlington, used KNS after failing to interest the local newspaper in a story about a practice of using care assistants in local nursing homes to certify death without the presence of a doctor. KNS checked out his story, sold it to the Mirror, and the modest fee benefited Fisher's group. The local newspaper, which had initially turned the story down apparently because it was too politically sensitive, promptly followed it up.<br> Matt Wells</p>",
  "<p>The power of persuasion<br> John Hegarty's article (The trouble with viral campaigns, October 11) was wrong on two counts. Firstly, the fact that Ford wouldn't take responsibility for the \"cat-decapitation\" does not show that digital media is unsuitable for brand building. It shows that Ford are scared of the web. Secondly, viral media are not, as Mr Hegarty suggests, without \"context\". Anyone who saw the Ford ad probably received it from a friend, a highly influential context. And that trusted introduction may well have later developed into the context of \"a relaxed chat down the pub\". Not the Sistine Chapel, but highly desirable for a car manufacturer. </p> <p>The point is that digital technology has given consumers control over their own media. It allows people to avoid what they don't like, pass on what they do and generate and publish their own content to a mass audience. And whether it's called citizen's media or consumer-generated media, it's greatest strength is that people trust it. Like Mr Hegarty I also haven't heard anyone say: \"I am eating virtual tonight\". But if I heard it from a good friend, I might be interested in joining them. <br><strong> James Cherkoff, Collaborate Marketing</strong> </p> <p><strong> Tribunals must be taken seriously</strong><br> I was appalled by the recent depiction of an employment tribunal in a popular television soap which played into the hands of the increasingly litigious society that is overpowering UK businesses today. Small businesses are under enough pressure without tribunals being presented as quick, easy \"in one minute, out the next\" processes that mean money in the pocket for the employee and a slapped wrist for the employer. Tribunals have become increasingly formal - all present are expected to stand as the panel enters and the chairman always guides the order of events with the applicant or his/her representative making an opening statement, introducing the case, the salient facts and produce any documentary evidence and witnesses. </p> <p>With other pressures piling up for directors of UK businesses today, it is time that the media understand and appreciate these challenges instead of making a mockery of what can be a make-or-break procedure for a business by presenting it as a farce.<br><strong> Ian Davidson, Vizual HR Ltd</strong> </p> <p><strong> Change the brand, not the logo</strong><br> The news that McDonald's is temporarily dropping its golden arches in an attempt to get UK consumers to see that it is changing (The question mark over McDonald's, October 13) looks like a very misplaced case of letting the tail wag the dog - and a misunderstanding of how the McDonald's (or any other) visual icon works. If consumers have negative associations with those ubiquitous golden arches, it's because of the associations that McDonald's products, services and brand messages over the years have built up to connect with them - and not because they happen to be golden arches. Visual triggers work because of the cultural associations built up around them: think of the Nazi appropriation of the swastika, or the association between football hooligans and the St George cross. Associations can also be changed - think of how Brylcreem managed to change its associations, not by cosmetic tinkering with the visual brand identity, but by making meaningful change to the brand message through repositioning and relaunch. The only way McDonald's will win back consumers in the UK is by meaningful and transparent changes to its brand offering, and by confident embracing of its changing, responsive identity.<br><strong> Don Williams, CEO, pi global</strong> </p> <p><strong> Brighton rocked</strong><br> I suspect that Lewis Peake (Branson's scheme, Letters, October 11) is much younger than I am.

You can also pause and rewind live TV and it comes with its own EPG. </p> <p><strong> What's so special?</strong> Sky Plus's original equivalent had just 40GB of capacity, enough to store around 20 hours of recorded progammes. Its latest 160GB model has four times that capacity but that's still dwarfed by the Type X's 1000GB store and ability to record six channels simultaneously. </p> <p><strong> All this in a stylish futuristic package?</strong> Depends. Fans of heavyweight hardware will no doubt gasp at its size and those who threw out their storage heaters in the 1970s might find its tower-sized girth a little overbearing. Nice remote control though. </p> <p><strong> Wow or ugh?</strong> Aficionados of non-stop QVC will no doubt find the ability to record nearly a week's worth of programmes a boon. Especially time-rich viewers or the perennially horizontal may find the six built-in tuners a must-have. Those who don't have the time to watch TV continuously might find themselves muttering \"technical\" and \"overkill\". Maybe TV in Japan, where the Type X is on sale next month, is light years ahead of UK TV. It would have to be to justify getting one of these. </p> <p><strong> When can I get one?</strong> You can't. Well not unless you live in Japan and have a spare \u00a34,500. \"No visibility\" for a UK launch, says Sony.</p>",
  "<p>The world may have gone off globalisation in a big way but more money is being poured into public relations than ever before on both sides of the Atlantic. So what is going on? Is this PR doing anyone any good? Or is it just face powder disguising the onset of decline? </p> <p>There is no doubt that People Power is getting stronger and corporations more jumpy. So they should be. We're all more in tune with what is a stunt, hatched for publicity, and what are genuine product benefits. In future, when a human voice cuts through the robotic chanting of advertising copy and the blandness of today's political rhetoric, we must cheer it wholeheartedly. </p> <p>Which brings us to Manchester, where US corporate investor and sports fan Malcolm Glazer is coming a definite second in what has been a difficult PR fight at Manchester United Football Club. </p> <p>Initially, the scrap has been with the United fans themselves rather than other major shareholders, who seemed prepared to accept the tycoon's offer to buy the club. </p> <p>Members of Shareholders United, the largest and most vociferous of the supporters groups, have been seeking to block the sale, claiming that they are nearing the critical 5% stake, at which point their voice becomes legally audible. </p> <p>These fans, who own a handful of shares each, have been using powerful guerrilla tactics which PR professionals have recognised with a sense of foreboding. </p> <p>Their protest over the past few weeks has been aimed at preventing United from falling into the hands of a corporate raider whom they felt did not care for their club. They demonstrated that they were prepared to wage war to see off Glazer, and their street slogans have been clearly noted. </p> <p>They don't want to see their buoyant plc bought by a new owner who would then borrow against the club's \u00a3600m estimated value. And these protesters are confident because they have used street tactics successfully before. </p> <p>When Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB bid \u00a31bn for United in 1999, the fans used lobbying techniques not unfamiliar to sharp-suited City PR types, on Stephen Byers at the Department of Trade and Industry until he effectively caved in and ruled Murdoch offside. </p> <p>Here's an example of the kind of emotive pitch on offer at the Manchester United non-corporate, unofficial fan sites, addressing the current threat of private American ownership: </p> <p>\"Think about what would happen if someone came along, without any knowledge of United, without any interest in our history, and without any regard whatsoever for us and for our heritage. Think about what would happen if such a person came from some far-off land, and simply because he was so very rich was able to buy our football club and own it. Think about what you could do about it if he wanted to milk it for all the cash it was worth.\" </p> <p>He could, of course, have been talking about Chelsea. </p> <p>If the fans see Glazer off, the protest will prove a wake up call to that mode of corporate thinking which believes that, thanks to its financial clout and ability to deploy traditional PR muscle, it can act, if not beyond the law, beyond whatever limits the public naturally afford it. </p> <p>But they'll need to watch the image they project very carefully. There's a fanatical balaclava-wearing fringe element that will play dirty .Pitch invasions, dug-up turf, abuse and paint-bombed directors' cars have been direct action tools that have generated press coverage, scared the City and might have chipped away at the share price. </p> <p>The older and wiser Manchester United fans seem to be presenting themselves as commercial sophisticates, appalled at the callousness with which shareholders' interests in the plc threaten to take precedence over what happens on the pitch. </p> <p>They know how to strike at the heart of the issue .Of the club's \u00a3170m turnover, 27% is from commercial activity away from the pitch itself. A coordinated global merchandise boycott could be deployed if Glazer doesn't go away. </p> <p>This homespun PR campaign might just have struck the first decisive blow but the fight is not over yet. </p> <p>It will, however, signal to all the multinational giants that the power of PR is falling into the hands of the people. </p> <p>Now that is a sobering thought.</p>",
  "<p>My career has been a series of accidents. I spent most of my time at university involved in drama, and was accepted on to a postgraduate directing course. But I was unsure about pursuing a career in film-making and decided to add another string to my bow. I applied for a job at the BBC. Luckily, the trainee at Radio Nottingham had just been promoted. They offered me \u00a33,000 a year - much more than the \u00a3950 I'd receive on the directing course so it was an easy choice. </p> <p>As a trainee reporter in 1978, I was the dogsbody, being sent round the station's range of programmes from religion to rock. It taught me the essential broadcasting skills, which I lacked. After only two years I took over the breakfast show, which was current affairs-based and aimed at a mature audience. I soon became frustrated broadcasting to much older people than myself at a time when I was passionate about contemporary music and culture, such as the Jam. </p> <p>Although my ambition had always been to work on Radio 1's Newsbeat - the ultimate youth-orientated current affairs programme - they kept on rejecting me. I eventually moved to London in 1981 to join Capital as a reporter. It was a great place to work, with a buccaneering tabloid culture opposed to the uptight BBC, and it was a challenge, learning to write for a younger audience with a much bigger news patch than I'd been used to. On my first day an IRA bomb exploded in Oxford Street and I was sent to cover it - a huge and terrifying assignment. Yet I nearly missed my deadline as I was stuck in a taxi in the gridlocked traffic, oblivious to the fact I was within walking distance of the newsroom. </p> <p>Within three years, despite the earlier rejections, I finally joined Newsbeat. A happy and successful time there was marred only slightly by the time I once woke up at home a minute before I was due in the studio to give a 6.30am broadcast. </p> <p>My first managerial role came back at Capital as deputy head of news and talk. I was responsible for introducing tabloid news values and raising the profile - and decibels - of football commentator Jonathan Pearce. The flagship news programme The Way It Is was a fast-paced, loud affair, which I am convinced was satirised by The Day Today, whose creator Chris Morris I employed at my next job. </p> <p>My stint as managing editor at Radio London was a tremendous challenge. I relaunched the shambles that produced a weird combination of broadcasting as GLR, the first mixed music and speech station of its kind for grown-ups, but it was a struggle, with a marketing budget of \u00a35,000 competing against Capital's \u00a31m. </p> <p>In 1993 I became controller of Radio 1. I told them they had to revolutionise as it was becoming too middle-aged - Nirvana had been deemed too noisy for the station. It was one of the strangest interviews of my life with personnel from across the corporation grilling me. Most people remember me for bringing Chris Evans across from GLR, where I first employed him, and despite breaking the mould, our relationship ended acrimoniously. It was never easy axeing so many DJs, although I introduced many new faces. </p> <p>I left the station to take on roles at the BBC which were increasingly distant from those for which I entered broadcasting, including director of marketing and communications. I soon became fed up and had to get out. Leaving the BBC was nerve-racking as for the first time since leaving university I had no guarantee of work, while desperately seeking a return to the airwaves. I put out feelers to 5 Live, who thankfully, within two years, gave me my new break, putting me back on the air, in a role not dissimilar to the one I had at Capital in the early 1980s, launching a two-hour live news show. And now I'm presenting a weeknight slot which is great because there's no interference from the bosses, who are at dinners or in bed. </p> <p>5 Live was a great place to relearn how to do what I was so passionate about when I entered broadcasting nearly 25 years earlier, but today, the industry is totally different to the one I stumbled into - it's much more competitive, but there are more opportunities as a result of the increasing array of outlets. To succeed, you must be energetic and be prepared to work very long hours. If you want to be a presenter, you have to be true to yourself, as genuine individuality is hankered after and there's no point trying to be a clone of another presenter such as Nicky Campbell or for that matter, Matthew Bannister. </p> <p><strong>Matthew Bannister's CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Jobs:</strong> BBC Radio Nottingham; Capital FM; Newsbeat, Radio 1; managing editor, GLR; controller, Radio 1; head of BBC Radio; BBC director of marketing; chairman and chief executive, Trust the DJ; BBC Radio 5 Live </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Law, Nottingham University </p> <p><strong> Career high:</strong> Launching The Way It Is at Capital in the 1980s, it was a blast of fresh air </p> <p><strong> Career low:</strong> Stressful early days at Radio 1, with the audience in freefall, no one believing in the strategy of axeing long-serving DJs and terrible press coverage </p> <p><strong> Embarrassing moment:</strong> Going halfway across Nottinghamshire to do an interview and getting back to base to discover the tape was blank </p> <p><strong> Morning delivery:</strong> the Guardian on a Monday and the Telegraph on a Saturday, which has beaten the Sunday papers at their own game </p> <p><strong> Radio choice:</strong> Jonathan Ross on Radio 2, \"captivating\" </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong>MediaGuardian publishes In Print, A Career in Journalism and On Air, A Career in TV and Radio, both edited by Chris Alden.

  "<p>Until very recently, BBC Radio had a department called Talks and - with the exception of AJP Taylor's improvised historical orations - the lecture has always seemed a more natural form for the wireless than for television. Yet this week sees the beginning of two major historical series which are essentially illustrated talks. </p> <p>In Monarchy, Dr David Starkey begins a four-year, 20-part examination of what this country's kings and queens have contributed to our our definitions of democracy and nationhood and, in his three-parter The Power of Nightmares, producer Adam Curtis examines what he sees as the fear-mongering of the Bush and Blair administrations. </p> <p>And, viewed together, these series offer a tempting thesis to a lecturer on television because they embody the two main possible styles of factual documentary: presenter-led and producer-driven. Starkey is rarely off screen; Curtis is never seen. </p> <p>The Power of Nightmares follows the style of previous Curtis series including The Century of the Self and Pandora's Box: an artful collage of archive footage - much of it obscure in origin but re-used with lethal point - is intercut with expert interviewees and overlaid with a voiceover commentary from the director that combines history, philosophy and political theory. </p> <p>In this project, Curtis advances the argument that politicians of the past prospered by promising dreams but that leaders these days thrive by highlighting the nightmares from which they will protect the public. This thesis is slightly tendentious - Churchill and Roosevelt were surely chosen by voters to manage military or economic nightmares - but Curtis goes on to make an even bolder claim: suggesting that the terrorist menace invoked by Bush and Blair is largely fictional. </p> <p>The riskiness of this proposition can be measured by the fact that this series would be very hard to screen in New York, Bali, Russia or Madrid, and there are possible circumstances in which it would have to be pulled from the schedules in Britain. </p> <p>But, if the political position of the films feels over-simplified, Curtis's presentation of his evidence is complex and challenging. He begins, quite unexpectedly, in the middle of the last century with two political philosophers: Sayyid Qutb in Egypt and Leo Strauss in America. Both, he explains, believed that liberalism was weakening the moral certainties of the societies in which they lived. </p> <p>Knowing that the Bush administration is full of neo-Straussians - including Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz - I guessed half the pay-off but not the rest, which is that Qutb's views became a leading influence on Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Therefore, as Curtis presents it, \"the war on terror\" is being fought between a government and an organisation rooted in a similar hatred of liberal pluralism, who both encourage support by raising fears of invasion and immigration. </p> <p>My own view is that Curtis under-estimates the reality of the terrorist threat, but his programmes are bloody clever stuff: full of ingenious parallels (the American neo-cons are shown to have exaggerated the Soviets' possession of \"weapons of mass destruction\") and startling archive footage including Egyptian television adverts. </p> <p>If Curtis had written up The Power of Nightmares as a fat hardback, he would have sold several million copies and received a chair at a liberal American university, but those who seek intelligent and provocative television should be glad that he chose to do it on the box. </p> <p>Intriguingly, Dr Starkey's Monarchy also begins with a bold contemporary parallel. Over shots of Bush and Blair appearing imperial, the historian explains that a modern democratic leader is \"a king for the time being\", his power as absolute as any early monarch's, and so the story of Alfred the Great has relevance to what happened in Iraq. </p> <p>Recent events have made us a nation of political commentators and Starkey clearly wants to have his shot, but his series is a satisfying enough meal without this contemporary garnish. You can, though, see why Starkey wanted to bring in Bush and Blair, because one of his gifts as a historian is for intelligent contemporary parallels and sharp use of jargon. King Ethelbert was \"inviting Augustine to market-test Christianity\". The Saxon conquest of Britain was \"ethnic cleansing at its most effective\": 200,000 new immigrants swamped a population of two million. </p> <p>Starkey's other talent is the natural attack of his personality. In tortoiseshell glasses that give him a disconcerting resemblance to Dame Edna Everage, he delivers his theories in such torrential monologues that you sometimes have to wind back to grasp an idea. But no one is going to complain about that at a time when viewers are fast-forwarding Alan Titchmarsh's ghastly The British Isles - A Natural History in the forlorn hope of finding one intelligent thought. </p> <p>Just as Titch prompts critics to call for a coroner's inquest on historical documentary, these two starkly different but equally intelligent examples prove that the genre is alive. </p> <p><strong>The reel deal</strong></p> <p>In Mark Chappell's sitcom My Life in Film, the life of the central character, aspiring film-maker Art (Kris Marshall), is a portmanteau movie or a multiplex. Each episode has the style of a different film: when Art takes an intensive driving course, the events take on the shape of Top Gun as he competes with a star parallel-parker for the heart of the sexy instructress. Attendance at a friend's marriage becomes an elaborate parody of Four Weddings and a Funeral. </p> <p>The basic joke is to substitute British banality for Hollywood pomposity: in the Top Gun programme, a show-down between the alpha males takes the form of a table-tennis game. The cleverness of the device is that - as in the first series of Alan Partridge before we saw any domestic moments - the personality of the central character is revealed entirely within the satire. Even the scenes featuring Art at home are movie parodies: an episode confined entirely to his flat is played as a spoof of Rear Window. </p> <p>Although almost every shot and line of dialogue is borrowed from somewhere else, My Life in Film manages, paradoxically, to feel original.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Monarchy, Monday, 9pm, Channel 4; The Power of Nightmares, Wednesday, 9pm, BBC2; My Life in Film, Tuesday, 9.30pm, BBC3</p>",
  "<p>Mervyn King says the Nice decade is over. The years of non-inflationary consistent expansion (geddit) will be replaced by the not-so-bad decade as unemployment rises to keep inflation in check. </p> <p>As far as the governor of the Bank of England is concerned, that's not a bad outcome. If you look at the headline-grabbing numbers, the picture has indeed been rosy for a prolonged period. There has not been a quarter of falling output since the recession of the early 1990s, the unemployment count is at its lowest for 30 years and inflation, at 1.1%, is the third lowest in Europe. It is this combination of steady growth, a low jobless total and inflation well under control that allows Gordon Brown to say that Labour has brought an end to Tory boom and bust. As the governor noted in his speech last week, the relationship between unemployment and inflation has defied those who thought that a tightening of the labour market would re-ignite price pressures. </p> <p>All this is true. The European Central Bank would be well advised to look at the way in which inflation in the UK has carried on falling even while the unemployment rate as measured by the claimant count has dropped below 3%, levels not seen since the postwar golden age. Britain's macro-economic framework is robust - far more so than Europe's or America's. Full credit to the chancellor and the governor for that. </p> <p>Moreover, the economy trundles along. Growth has been steady, if unspectacular, since 1997, and that is likely to continue. This week's GDP figures for the third quarter will confirm King's view of the UK being in a soft spot, but the upshot of that is long-term rates are already coming down in response to the justifiable belief that short-term ones have peaked. </p> <p>Looser monetary policy will underpin growth next year. </p> <p>Yet, in a way King and Brown miss the wider point, which is that the economy is riddled with ingrained weaknesses. What about the UK property market, which John Calverley, who features elsewhere on this page, calls the mother of all bubbles? No boom there, presumably?How about manufacturing? It has not been a particularly nice decade for the 750,000 who have lost their jobs since Labour came to power. Is it not a sign of a country out of kilter that the government has plans to build 500,000 homes in the south-east even though the blueprint threatens a water crisis, will damage historic towns and put intolerable pressure on an infrastructure already buckling under the strain? </p> <p>The end of boom and bust? Don't make me laugh. By some miracle, the bits of Britain that are booming cancel out the bits that are bust, while the deftness of the Bank of England and the credibility of the chancellor help create the entirely false impression that the economy is in rude health. </p> <p>Look at just a few of the events of the past week. On Monday, the Office for National Statistics released the latest trade figures. You may have missed them, because they didn't get much play in the media, but they were dreadful. The UK had a deficit in goods of \u00a35.2bn in August and \u00a315.2bn in the latest three months. At the current rate, the annual deficit will be \u00a360bn, or \u00a31,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. </p> <p>If this seems incongruous at a time when China has been enjoying a stupendous boom and has helped revive the Japanese economy with its insatiable demand for imports, it shouldn't be. If the Chinese needed estate agents, currency speculators or website designers, Britain has a tonne of these. But for now, Beijing is after machine tools and consumer goods; the hollowing out of British industry means we don't have the capacity to take advantage of China's growth. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Adair Turner's report on pensions came out. Although it was hard to conceive of a document more depressing than the trade figures, Turner managed it. He laid bare the full extent of the black hole in pensions following years of government incompetence and corporate mismanagement. At no stage was there any suggestion that individuals had erred, apart from, of course, in trusting the politicians when they were told national insurance contributions would provide a decent state pension and that paying into private pensions would deliver a bit extra on top. Yet, despite the fact that financial risk has been transferred lock, stock and barrel to the individual, it will be the individual who has to pick up the pieces. The options are: pay loads more taxes and risk killing the economy; save more, voluntarily or compulsorily; work until you are 70. Thanks a bunch. </p> <p>On Wednesday, there was some good news from the latest labour market data showing that the claimant count was down a little to 834,000. The less good news was that inactivity is also rising. Nor has Labour made a dent in the 2.7 million people on incapacity benefit or severe disability allowance, many of them men in their 50s thrown on the scrapheap during the 1980s and 90s. In many parts of the UK, employment rates are at least 20 percentage points below the UK average, with those who are not working expunged from the labour market statistics. The logic escapes me of having half the country working flat out while the other half is pensioned off early and then forgotten. </p> <p>Getting the employment level in the regions up to the UK average will take a real effort and real resources. So it was a bit disconcerting to find on Thursday that the main thrust of the government's regional policy appears to be concentrated in the south-east and we can expect the jobs of the future to be created in the mega-casinos that will flourish as a result of the deregulation of gambling. </p> <p>What can be concluded from all this? It could be that the 750,000 jobs lost in manufacturing, the \u00a360bn annualised trade deficit, the plumping up of the housing market and the over-mighty state of finance are a price worth paying for the abolition of boom and bust (sic). The strong pound may be the death-knell for manufacturing, but it keeps inflation low and attracts enough capital into Britain to offset the deficit being run in goods and services. By this measure, we are going to need an even stronger pound soon because there will be a need for even more hot money once the oil in the North Sea runs out, adding to the trade gap. </p> <p>An alternative conclusion is that the economy is living on borrowed time, and that the crisis - when it comes - might be no bad thing. The last Tory bust, for example, occurred on Black Wednesday in September 1992 and resulted in a sharp fall in the value of the pound coupled with a tightening of fiscal policy to ensure that any boost to the economy was concentrated on production rather than consumption. Manufacturing output rose and the trade gap narrowed during the Major government of 1992-97, while the housing market stagnated. </p> <p>Although it was massively unpopular at the time, in retrospect the economy then looked a lot more balanced and healthy than it looks now. Indeed, policy over the past seven years seems a continuation of that over the past 100 years, with an over-valued exchange rate crippling manufacturing and ensuring the bright ideas of British inventors are exploited in other countries. </p> <p>Tax credits for R&amp;D are all very well, extra spending on the science base commendable. But Britain is America writ small: living way beyond its means and in need of a lower exchange rate to enable it to pay its way in the world. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A transcript of the exchanges between ambulance controllers and a doctor attempting to transfer a dying teenage cancer patient 300 yards to intensive care has been released by the boy's parents. </p> <p>An investigation has been launched into the two-hour delay in July during which 16-year-old Luke Gallimore slipped into a coma while being treated at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. </p> <p>His mother, Jackie, spoke yesterday of her distress at the failure to dispatch an ambulance in time for her son. \"I am devastated, heartbroken,\" she said. \"It's bad enough him being diagnosed as having leukaemia but the memory of my son sat waiting for that ambulance for two hours will never go away. </p> <p>\"It's like a video recording that keeps playing in my head. I can accept that he's dead but I will never get over what happened in those two hours. </p> <p>\"The last words my son said to me were: 'I'm going to be all right, aren't I mum?' </p> <p>\"I said: 'Of course you are'. </p> <p>\"No family should have to go through that. We will never know that if he had been picked up by the ambulance in 15 minutes, if he would be OK now.\" </p> <p>As Luke's condition deteriorated, his consultant, Keiron Lennon, made increasingly frantic efforts to persuade the controllers to send a vehicle. Luke was receiving oxygen and could not be moved between wards on the same site without an ambulance. </p> <p>Mrs Gallimore's distress was compounded after she learnt that three ambulances had reportedly been parked outside the hospital's A&amp;E department but could not be released to help Luke. The accident department is on another site, about a mile from his ward. </p> <p>While waiting for an ambulance, Luke slipped into a coma from which he never regained consciousness. After 16 days on a ventilator, he died as result of the cancer and pneumonia. </p> <p>In the recording, Dr Lennon can be heard demanding to know why Luke had not been moved. \"This is extremely urgent,\" he says. \"It's a 16-year-old who is critically unwell who needs to get to ICU yesterday. I've been waiting here over an hour now and this lad is in danger if he doesn't get to ICU very, very quickly.\" </p> <p>A controller replies: \"Doctor, A&amp;E is holding the crews, they're not letting them clear. We've got three crews waiting in A&amp;E to offload patients.\" </p> <p>Luke had just taken his GCSEs and was set to begin A-levels in sport and IT. </p> <p>Mrs Gallimore, a medical receptionist, said yesterday: \"Luke was just a normal boy, he loved football. When the consultant told him what was wrong with him he just said 'I will still be able to play football, won't I?'\" </p> <p>A Staffordshire ambulance service NHS trust spokesman said yesterday: \"At this stage we have no further comment to make. There's an inquiry at the hospital which we are party to.\" </p> <p>A hospital spokeswoman said: \"Staff at the the hospital would like to offer our sincerest condolences to Mr and Mrs Gallimore. This is a tragic situation. When the investigation is completed in the next few days senior staff will meet [the family] to discuss its findings and reassure them about any changes we plan to make.\" </p> <p><strong> 'It's politics, and not fair on your patients'</strong><br> </p> <p>Extracts of transcript, supplied by Luke Gallimore's family, of his consultant Kieron Lennon speaking to Staffordshire ambulance service on July 11 </p> <p><strong> Dr Lennon</strong> \"There's been an ambulance arranged to pick up a lad from ward 73.\" </p> <p><strong> Ambulance control</strong> \"Right, we just discussing that.

We don't purposefully hold up ... The only thing I can offer is a paramedic in a car to run you to the ward ... I can pass you over to our supervisor.\" </p> <p><strong> Dr Lennon</strong> \"Please, yeah.\" </p> <p><strong> Supervisor</strong> \"Doctor, I've been listening to the call so I do understand what's happening ...

And now you've got the problem. They get held up at the hospital. It's politics and it's not fair on your patients; but I'm going to speak very strongly to the bed manager - I'm sure she can get one of these cleared.\"</p>",
  "<p>Yvonne Power, 49, has always hated housework, and this probably helped save her life. While her older sister, Evelyn, was helping scrub her father's overalls, Yvonne was turning handstands in the garden, or playing with the toy wooden roundabout her father had made for her. </p> <p>Her father, John, was good with his hands. For 25 years, from the early 60s, he was a foreman at Cape, in Cowley, Oxford. His job was to cut asbestos boards for ceiling panels. He died of mesothelioma, the asbestos-related cancer, 11 years ago, at the age of 67. Evelyn died of mesothelioma in 1996, aged 45, and her mother, Barbara Fitt died of mesothelioma, aged 71, last month. </p> <p>Experts believe that mother and daughter contracted the disease from washing John's overalls, an innocent enough activity, you would think, but not when they are covered in tiny asbestos particles. Barbara thought she was doing nothing more serious than the weekend wash. But those days at the old Belfast sink were the beginning of the end. \"I remember dad coming home and his hair was quite white,\" says Yvonne, \"but he didn't have grey hair, he had dark.\" She can also remember him leaning over the kitchen sink, bare-backed, while her mother carefully picked out asbestos fibres with a pair of needle-tip tweezers. </p> <p>Yvonne worked at Cape in the 70s as a secretary, and would visit her father. \"Saws were going all the time with clouds of dust billowing up.\" </p> <p>There were no showers or areas for the men to change. Instead, they would bring the near-invisible needle-like fibres home. Now their wives and daughters are dying horrible deaths as a result. \"These were men just trying to earn a living,\" says Yvonne, \"just trying to look after their families.\" </p> <p>Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral and was used extensively for about 150 years as a fireproofing and insulating material, until the dangers were made public in the mid-60s. There are three severe asbestos related diseases: asbestosis - a scarring of the lung tissue; lung cancer; and mesothelioma, a cancerous tumour that encases the lining of the lungs, growing like a vice. It is a very painful death, like a slow suffocation. </p> <p>Like asbestosis, mesothelioma has a long latency period, developing anything from 15-60 years after the dust is inhaled. But there are significant differences. Most people do not die from asbestosis. Mesothelioma, on the other hand, is always fatal. Asbestosis never occurs in members of the public who haven't worked with asbestos. Mesothelioma, by contrast, does. It may occur after only very brief exposure. So working with asbestos won't necessarily kill you, but washing it off a pair of trousers can. </p> <p>\"Why some people contract mesothelioma and others asbestosis or lung cancer is thought to be down to genetic disposition,\" explains Dr Chris Warburton, consultant respiratory physician at the Aintree Chest Centre in Liverpool. Around 1,800 people die each year from mesothelioma and domestic exposure cases account for around 5% of these deaths. And cases of mesothelioma are increasing. Chest physicians in Sheffield, for example, expected to see half a dozen cases a year in 1990; now it is more like one a week. </p> <p>\"I worry about mesothelioma because there seems to be no threshold,\" admits Adrian Budgen, a partner of the law firm Irwin Mitchell, and head of its national asbestos team. \"The extent of secondary exposure has clearly taken the insurance industry and some doctors by surprise. Now, we are seeing more unusual cases and that is a real cause for concern.\" </p> <p>I visited Barbara Fitt in June, three month before her death. \"Everything has changed,\" she told me, from the sofa where she sat, propped up by cushions - fragile and focused on breathing: get air in, get it out again; get it in, get it out again. She lived with her daughter Yvonne, and Yvonne's husband, who is self-employed, and their three children, in Camberley. </p> <p>She had been diagnosed with mesothelioma the summer before. She used to like ballroom dancing, crosswords, women's magazines and knitting - cable, Fair Isle, socks, jumpers, she could knit anything. Take a Break and My Weekly magazines sat unread by her bedside as the morphine made it difficult for her to concentrate. She had, however, taught her granddaughters to knit. \"They have had to learn fast,\" she said. She was stoical and resigned. \"Nothing can change anything,\" she said, before hunching up to get a drink from the kitchen. </p> <p>It was an agonising walk, both painfully close and infinitely distant. She felt hot, she said, because of the asbestos. It felt as if your insides were burning. She knew it was only going to get worse, from her experience of nursing both Evelyn and John. \"I think that is what makes it so awful. I know what is in front of me. It's not like being run over by a bus, or dying of lung cancer. I know everything. It's not nice.\" </p> <p>\"People are usually absolutely shell-shocked, blown away by the diagnosis,\" says Liz Darlison, who runs the National Mesothelioma Information Centre in Leicester - a new initiative set up in response to the growing number of sufferers. \"Typically, patients have never heard of the disease, let alone know how they got it. And if exposure was in the home, there can be a lot of guilt.\" </p> <p>Of course, the real culprits are the companies who put profit before safety; or at least failed to provide showers. The last few months of John, Evelyn, and Barbara's lives were spent fighting a difficult battle for compensation from Cape. They eventually won. \"But,\" Barbara told me, \"you ask my grandchildren what they'd prefer. Me every time.\" </p> <p>Damages typically range from \u00a340-60,000. These claims are never easy, says Sally Moore, a partner at Leigh Day and Co, not least because, these businesses, like spam fritters and black and white TVs, are part of our past. But being a woman at home makes it even harder. \"Because the wife was not employed by the company, you are generally looking for the public liability insurer, rather than the employer liability insurer,\" explains Moore. \"That is a significant difference, because public liability is not compulsory and never has been.\" </p> <p>Contracting an industrial disease at home also means you need to prove exposure. You need a witness - the husband, say, who brought the dust home. If you no longer have a husband, then you don't have a claim, unless you can find other witnesses. </p> <p>Jennifer Pascott, 67, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in January. When I talked to her at home in June, three months before she died, I was painfully aware of a bowl of syringes and a bottle of morphine sulphate sitting alongside the dish of china sweets on the glass coffee table in the sitting room of her immaculate Sheffield bungalow. </p> <p>She hadn't seen her husband, Jo, for 30 years when she was diagnosed. He worked at British Furnaces, Chesterfield, lining furnaces with asbestos, in the late 60s. Their son, Adam, was born in 1971. Jo walked out four years later. The separation was acrimonious. Jennifer got a job in a car show room, then worked as an estate agent. She sang in the church choir, walked and cooked. Her husband, like the Ali Baba laundry basket in which she kept his clay-covered work trousers, was history. Then the breathlessness and back pain started. </p> <p>\"It's Jo, here, how are you feeling?\" was the telephone call that broke the 30-year silence, after Helen Ashton, Jennifer's lawyer from Irwin Mitchell, tracked him down a few months ago. He lived barely 10 minutes away and, luckily, was happy to help. \"He has not been to see me,\" Jennifer told me. \"He would probably like to, but I can't stand any hassle at the moment.\" In the past few months, Adam, who works for the Norwich Union, has found a father and lost a mother. </p> <p>Women like Jennifer have another disadvantage. If you contract the disease at home, you are not entitled to the same disability benefit as those who were exposed at work. This can amount to around \u00a3120 a week. Nor do these women qualify for a pneumonicosis benefit scheme, set up by the government in the late 70s for people with long latency illnesses who are not able to bring claims because their employers have gone out of business. This can be a lump sum of around \u00a340,000. </p> <p>Clearly, this extra money can make a difference. A chairlift, says Christine, whose mother Teresa Maguire died of mesothelioma in May, would have transformed the last few months. In March, Teresa was awarded \u00a382,000 compensation in a landmark judgment against Harland and Wolff, that pushed back the date at which companies should have known about the dangers of asbestos, from 1965 to 1960. The company contested and is still fighting the award; Teresa died before any money was paid. </p> <p>She contracted the disease four years ago, aged 64, as a result of washing the work clothes of her husband Jimmy, a boilermaker in Liverpool docks. She met Jimmy in a dance hall. They married, aged 25, around the time he started working for Harland and Wolff's shipyard. They moved to a former council house in Liverpool, with dahlias and marigolds lining the garden path, around 21 years ago. </p> <p>\"We had such plans,\" says Jimmy, who retired in 2001. \"Days out. Walking. We had our passes, we could go anywhere.\" Instead, Jimmy nursed his wife, carrying her up and down stairs and into the bath. When this became too painful for her, he slept by her side on a camp bed in the sitting room. \"She loved her bedroom,\" says Jimmy. She would have liked to have spent her last days in it. \"But Tess didn't like to make a fuss.\" </p> <p>Jimmy makes a painful face and looks away. He swallows hard and clears his throat. \"She never complained.\" She didn't know about asbestos, adds Christine, \"My mum was just doing her job as a wife.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> National Mesothelioma Information Centre freephone helpline: 0800 169 2409 (open Monday/Wednesday/Thursday from 9am-4pm).</p>",
  "<p>The afternoon sun moves slowly across a cobalt blue Caribbean sky. With a gentle whir the circular sun pod you are reclining on rotates imperceptibly to catch the last rays. You reach for your laptop and with a click of the mouse a computer-generated voice starts reading your favourite blockbuster novel. No sooner has the thought that your shoulders might be burning crossed your mind than Ralph, your personal tanning butler, appears with an arsenal of sunscreens tucked into a holster around the waist of his designer trunks and offers to rub them in for you. </p> <p>This is not some Barbarella-style vision of the future but the face of luxury travel in 2004. </p> <p>Where once a mini-bar and a chocolate on the pillow were considered the height of luxury, today's five-star hotels are going to greater lengths to give their guests the ultimate pampering experience. From dedicated butlers to wireless internet access by the pool, nothing, it seems, is too much trouble. </p> <p>But in their quest to move with the times and trump the competition, have these pleasure palaces lost sight of what their guests really want? Is the new face of luxury a rotating sun lounger? </p> <p>The designers of the Palms Resort obviously think so. Guests at the lavish new hotel due to open in the Turks &amp; Caicos in January can work on their tan on the pods (though word is that they are encountering a few technical hitches), and listen to their favourite tunes on a complimentary iPod whilst lounging next to the $1.8m infinity pool. When they tire of that they can head off to the spa for a 'Mother of Pearl' exfoliation using crushed native queen conch shells. </p> <p>Over the top? This is positively restrained compared with the orgy of opulence on offer at the Emirates Palace which opens in December in Abu Dhabi. Already designated as a 'national monument', the hotel will combine old- style embellishments (gold-encrusted domes, mosaics, spiral staircases and water features) with new-style frills such as wireless internet access around the swimming pool and on the beach, enabling guests - should they temporarily take leave of their senses - to take their laptop to the beach, download their favourite book and read it on screen. </p> <p>Someone, somewhere (possibly the same person who came up with the idea of the sun pod) has decided that this is easier than packing a paperback. </p> <p>And herein lies the problem with the new generation of 'super luxury' hotels: once you have taken care of the basics - good service, good location, good food - too many of the so-called extras actually detract from the experience: culprits include porters who insist on relieving you of your bags the second you walk through the door, only to leave you waiting for the next 20 minutes for them to be brought to your room; turn-down services which always arrive just as you are getting into the shower; the man in the golf buggy who insists on trundling you the 50 yards from reception to the car park at two miles per hour. </p> <p>Higher levels of disposable income mean that more people than ever can afford to take the kind of holidays that once only rock stars, criminals and members of the aristocracy could enjoy. </p> <p>Longhaul tour operator Kuoni has seen its luxury business triple, with five-star hotels accounting for 20 per cent of all bookings. To cater for the increased prosperity of its clients, the company introduced private jet charter for the first time this year. 'This would have been unthinkable even five years ago but private jets are no longer the domain of the rich and famous,' said managing director Sue Biggs. 'People are using their money to buy time, which is now the greatest luxury of all. </p> <p>'In the 1980s our clients used to be lords and ladies but today they are just as likely to be high-flying city workers or honeymooners.' </p> <p>One of the upshots of this 'democratisation' of luxury is that the goal posts have had to move. As the middle classes start to encroach on the territory of the super-rich, luxury hoteliers have to raise the bar that little bit higher to pander to the elite - hence the recent flurry of six and even seven-star hotels and cruise ships. </p> <p>The Queen, Sir Elton John and Naomi Campbell aside, how many of us are actually comfortable with this level of cosseting? The latest fad is for hotels to offer personal butlers. Long believed to be a dying species, the butler is enjoying a spectacular new lease of life at luxury hotels across the globe. There are no less than 58 of them at the recently-opened Thalassa hotel in Cyprus - one for each room. Your very own Jeeves will will meet you at the airport with champagne, a cold towel and a limo, unpack for you, scatter rose petals on your bed and generally pander to your every whim. Which is fine if you are ok with the idea of somebody else running your bath or handling your smalls but most of us would find this level of attention intrusive. </p> <p>On a recent visit to the Elephant Corridor Hotel - billed as Sri Lanka's finest - a white-gloved young man came into my room every evening (usually as I was getting into the shower) and painstakingly spelt out Good Night in rose petals on my bed, while I waited in the bathroom for him to finish. His pained expression when I explained to him that I'd really rather he didn't, still haunts me to this day. </p> <p>As our survey of seasoned travellers shows, luxury has many definitions: space, time, privacy, good service. Nobody, but nobody, defines it as a hot chocolate sommelier. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Packages to the Palms Resort in the Turks and Caicos and the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi are available with ITC Classics (01244 355400; <a href=\"http://www.itcclassics.co.uk\">www.itcclassics.co.uk</a>) </p> <p><strong>Coming soon to a hotel near you</strong> </p> <p><strong> The bath butler</strong><br> Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel (<a href=\"http://www.thebalmoralhotel.com\">www.thebalmoralhotel.com</a>) introduced the services of a bath butler this summer, who will run your bath and add your choice of bubbles.

  "<p>Up they glide, tall and dark and silent, slick as pig-snot on a doorknob and significantly less charming, to remove and remove and remove. To remove, first, your ashtray, just at the point when you want to use it; to remove, second, your hard-bought sense of silence (or, if in company, togetherness) just as your thoughts (or desires) are beginning to coalesce; to remove, third, and repeatedly, and abruptly, all week, your self-esteem. </p> <p>This is bad service, an art in itself. It is hard to pin down yet easy to recognise, rather like a belch; and, similarly, it can happen anywhere, at any time. I have had trips to splendid places all but ruined by sneeringly robotic anti-service, and trips to unpromising hovels made ever memorable by the timely serving up, just-so, of a drink or a grin . </p> <p>The difference between the two is, of course, management. At a conservative estimate, 70 per cent of resort and hotel managements (for multinational chains, make it 90 per cent) get it wrong. They hire and train and treat their staff as quantifiable commodities; and, in return, the staff will treat the customers with one-size-fits-all lack of human regard. </p> <p>Of course, some travellers want this. Gold-plated travellers with little to do but moan: it doesn't matter to them whether the service is snotty, or obsequious, as long as it's there: but these are the people who shouldn't actually be allowed to travel, or read this newspaper, and they certainly shouldn't have been allowed, down the decades, to set the 'standards' for the rest of us. The rest of us must simply seek out grand service when and where it happens - service based on intelligence, friendliness, gumption, dignity, decent wages and everything else that gives management such headaches - and share it with others. Share news of the Cafe Brasileira in Lisbon, where they can remember 18 contiguous orders while flirting peacefully with your wife; or the guides/cooks/dawn raconteurs who run Tasmania's Bay of Fires, or the magically unobtrusive yet open-handed staff of Antigua's Carlisle Bay Resort. </p> <p>Compare their right with the exuberant getting-it-wrong of the overbeautiful morons of the overhyped Standard Hotel in LA, or the sneering procrastination of the check-out staff (four hours if you're lucky) at the Lemuria resort in the Seychelles, or the general attitude of any member of staff in any resort whose literature, at any point, features the word 'experience': and spread the word.</p>",
  "The language of political hyperbole used by some alarmists to describe the threat of Islamist radicals resembles the language of totalitarianism. It does not describe an empirically observed reality. It describes and exaggerates something feared and imagined. It describes what can be called a virtual reality, more urgent, and, in the minds of its users, more real than the 'real' reality. <p>Paranoid projections based on enemy declarations and ignorant slogans have been the currency of presidential discourse in the United States. In Britain, too, the country's role in the war was justified by the Prime Minister with earnest moralism. Both the President and the Prime Minister cast the Islamic enemy as 'pure evil', motivated by 'hatred of freedom' and envy 'of our way of life', and which must be fought 'there' before it has to be fought on the streets of London, New York or in the placid suburbs of the United States. All this adds up to a false and grossly ideological conception of war between civilisations. </p> <p>This language also shapes the Islamic perception of what the West is doing. It affects the course of Islamic reform, tending to discredit forces of moderate, secular and progressive theological change as ineffectual. </p> <p>The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and events in Palestine, together with violence against Muslims elsewhere, are offering to Islamic society convincing, although ultimately false, evidence that a war against their civilisation is underway. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Muslims now fear that what is going on in the Gaza refugee camps and in Iraq is what, ultimately, may be in store for them. This already has had a ruinous effect on the movement of ideas and political reform between Western and Islamic societies. </p> <p>The intellectual godfather of modern Islamist radicalism is generally taken to have been the 20th-century Egyptian intellectual named Sayyid Qutb. A review of the literature on Islamic radicalism during the past 25 years (cited by John Zimmerman in the journal Terrorism and Political Violence ) shows Qutb routinely mentioned as one of the two most important intellectual influences on these movements and, in particular, as being the main (if indirect) inspiration for Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928 to oppose the secularising tendencies in Islamic society, influenced the Qutb tradition of religious revival and reform towards greater militancy and conservatism. </p> <p>Yet the most important reform movements in the Arab world before the Second World War were secular in character. A modernising and secular pan-Arab nationalism followed the First World War and gave rise to the Baath movement in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. Arab-Christian intellectuals were originally important in its development. They wanted an 'Arab nation' that was not exclusively Muslim. </p> <p>The most important effort to establish a secular pan-Arab 'nation' was that of Gamal Nasser in Egypt in the 1950s. This and the parallel 'Arab Socialist' movement were in part reactions to the shock of Israel's creation, and its defeat of the Arab armies in the 1948 war. </p> <p>These secular Arab movements failed. The depressing residue today of the Baath movement and of Arab socialism consists of hereditary Presidents for life and military dictators. </p> <p>Social and political reform has generally been more successful in monarchies whose legitimacy is ultimately religious, as in Morocco and Jordan. (Saudi Arabia's rulers are mere military usurpers of the Hashemite dynasty, hereditary protectors of the Holy Places.) </p> <p>The Ottoman Empire's survival until the First World War delayed the shock of foreign conquest on the Arab Middle East. In colonial Asia, a pattern of reaction was already evident, initially of resistance, then of accommodation or even conversion to Western ideas, producing an ideal - usually unattained - of synthesis with the West. </p> <p>Eventually, there were new forms of armed resistance, based on subversive ideas taken from the West: nationalism, and 20th-century national communism. Otherwise, there was the surviving idea of return to religion in order to find a new golden age. </p> <p>Today's militant Islamic revival has seemed a success because it is taken so seriously in the West. Al-Qaeda's attack on the United States have produced three years of frenzied and quasi-paranoid reaction by the American government. The rest of the world has been pushed to follow the American lead, convenient for many leaders with troublesome separatist or subversive minorities easily redefined as international terrorists. </p> <p>The Islamist movement itself evolved as a form of 'franchised' terrorism with a common ideological and inspirational base. It spread to aggrieved Muslims in Europe, Asia, Africa and the US. </p> <p>In reaction, the US, with allies, has invaded two countries (thus far) and overturned two governments. This has served chiefly to promote the Islamist message and recruit more militants. Iraq and Afghanistan today are the evidence of this. </p> <p>The new radical Islamism is a success in the moral and psychological damage it has inflicted on the United States and its allies. For the Islamic world it will inevitably prove still another failure. No great caliphate is going to be re-established. Even if all Islam were converted to the law of Sharia and the Taliban pattern of society, this would produce no great revival in terms relevant to the modern world. </p> <p>The quest for the lost golden age is a fool's mission. The peasant leader of the anti-Western T'ai P'ing uprising in 19th-century China, which killed mil lions, preached land distribution and egalitarianism, thought that he could produce a magical synthesis of Western and Eastern religion. He promised his followers a universal empire, but he was gone within a decade. </p> <p>The Indian Rebellion of 1857 - the 'Sepoy Mutiny' - which lasted for nearly two years, proclaimed a revival of the Moghul Empire when it reached Delhi. It was soon conquered, by mostly Indian forces. The great Boxer uprising in China in 1900 made its slogan 'Cherish the Dynasty - Exterminate the Foreigner!' The Empress indirectly encouraged it, but Western intervention crushed it. </p> <p>Osama bin Laden himself has gone from being the patron or financier of the Taliban movement to a fugitive existence in Waziristan. His followers may blow up Americans in the Green Zone of Baghdad. They can reinforce an Iraqi nationalism that will eventually force the US and its allies out of that country, to their humiliation. </p> <p>But as Gilles Kepel, the French authority on Islamic society, has already said, the Islamist movement is moribund in moral terms, although its military and political energy is not yet exhausted. There is no way in which it seriously threatens the Western industrial nations, other than through sporadic acts of terrorism. And that is the sort of thing Britain endured for many years from the IRA, Italy and Germany during the 1970s and 1980s from their Red Brigades, and Spain from Basque separatists. It is unpleasant, but it is not serious. (This is the lesson the American people refuse to understand.) </p> <p>The Islamist movement is a desperate effort by elements in a thwarted society to strike back at enemies. But it really wants only to expel the West and its influence from the Muslim world. It can't even do that. The Islamists want to conquer and convert Islamic society - not infidel society. </p> <p>Islamic fundamentalism has nothing to offer contemporary Islam. You cannot function in the 21st century on the basis of a primitive interpretation of Islamic law. That already is evident in Iran. Afghanistan under the Taliban had no future. The future of the Islamist movement itself is irrelevance. For the Islamic people, its legacy will be tragedy. </p> <p>William Pfaff is the author of two books on nationalism and the Western impact on the non-Western world: The Politics of Hysteria 1964, and The Wrath of Nations 1993. </p> <p>\u00a9 William Pfaff.

  "<p>The Ard\u00e8che is not one of the best-known destinations for foreign tourists, but it is one of the most popular for the French. </p> <p>The region runs along the western bank of the Rh\u00f4ne, sandwiched between the volcanoes of the Auvergne and the sunflower fields of Provence. There isn't a single motorway to spoil the wild landscapes - and there isn't even a working train station, so visitors have to make an effort to get there. </p> <p>The reward is some of the most spectacular scenery in the country, ranging from breathtaking gorges and rugged mountains to fragrant lavender fields and olive groves, prehistoric caves filled with stalactites and underground pools and the thick forests of the Cevennes National Park. </p> <p>Dozens of ancient stone villages, beautifully preserved, shelter beneath steep cliffs - they are working communities, unlike many of those in Provence which have scores of souvenir boutiques but not a single butcher or baker. </p> <p>Ard\u00e8che cuisine means hearty, traditional home cooking in reasonably priced local bistros, rather than fashionable Mediterranean food in chic restaurants. The real attraction is the sheer variety of outdoor activities, from the gentle such as canoeing, hot-air ballooning, kayaking and horse riding, to more vigorous pursuits including canyoning, rock climbing and mountain biking. </p> <p>Although the Ard\u00e8che has always been a great destination for those wanting to stay in villas, farmhouse g\u00eetes and sports-orientated campsites, hotel accommodation has been limited to run-of-the-mill Logis de France places.

Every evening the owners lay on wonderful meals (their 'tables d'h\u00f4tes'). </p> <p>These are gourmet events based on the freshest products from local farms, accompanied by little-known, excellent wines that are a bargain to take home. </p> <p>Here is a selection of the best places to stay, together with ideas for nearby excursions. </p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e1teau de Rochessauve</strong>, Rochessauve<br> (00 33 4 7565 0706; <a href=\"http://www.ch\u00e1teau-de-rochessauve.com\">www.ch\u00e1teau-de-rochessauve.com</a>) From \u20ac100 for a double; table d'h\u00f4te \u20ac30pp </p> <p>Everyone gets lost trying to find this magnificent 14th-century fortified chteau, but when the narrow road finally winds its way to the top of a steep mountain, emerging opposite the dark granite castle walls, it is difficult to imagine leaving again. The owners, Yannick and Jacques, are antique dealers who have decorated the rooms with all their prize possessions - Murano glass chandeliers, gilded mirrors, a Louis-Philippe chest of drawers - and are a mine of informa tion if you want to go bargain-hunting. Most of the food they serve for dinner (salad of courgettes marinated in onions and vinegar, apricot tart) is grown in their own vegetable garden, which is at the edge of a precipice with a phenomenal panorama over the surrounding countryside. </p> <p>A half-hour drive away is Aubenas, the capital of the Ard\u00e8che, a grand medieval town best visited on a Saturday morning when the whole centre becomes a sprawling farmers' market. </p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e1eau d'Uzer</strong> Uzer<br> (00 33 4 7536 8921; <a href=\"http://www.ch\u00e1teau-uzer.com\">www.ch\u00e1teau-uzer.com</a>) From \u20ac65-\u20ac100 for a double; table d'h\u00f4te \u20ac28pp </p> <p>From the outside, Chteau d'Uzer doesn't look too impressive, but as soon as you pass through the towering entrance gate you enter a magical world of interiors covered with pastel frescoes. There is a big playroom for children and the lush garden of palm trees and bamboo is truly special. The outdoor swimming pool is a designer lap pool - Asian-style, slim and narrow - and beside it is a classic wooden Gypsy caravan. It may look rustic, but is luxurious inside, with air-con, lavatory and shower, and is rented to guests. Muriel Chevalier is an excellent chef who loves cooking for her guests (aperitif with tiny home-made pizzas, blanquette de veau - or veal stew) and dining out in the garden under the stars is the highlight of a stay. Not only is breakfast included in the price, but an aperitif is organised every evening at sunset. The nearby villages of Balazuc and Vogue are two of the prettiest in France. </p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e1teau Clement</strong> Vals-les-Bains<br> (00 33 4 7587 4013; <a href=\"http://www.chateauclement.com\">www.chateauclement.com</a>) From \u20ac100 for double; table d'h\u00f4te \u20ac25pp </p> <p> For a real taste of chic chateau life, reserve one of the grand rooms at this imposing castle, hidden in a luxuriant three-hectare garden park. The owner may be called Marie-Antoinette, but the castle dates from the 19th century - a typical Victorian folly with flamboyant towers, turrets and a dramatic double wooden staircase swirling down to the entrance hall. Again, the cuisine is outstanding, from the aperitif of local sparkling chardonnay, accompanied by toasts covered with homemade liver pt\u00e9 and pork rillette, through to irresistible desserts (gteau fondant de chocolat) - the chef is a patisserie specialist. Chteau Clement looks out over the spa resort of Vals, with its famous mineral water. If you don't fancy a thermal treatment, the town's micro-brewery, Bouganel, is fun, offering ales flavoured with chestnut or blueberry. </p> <p><strong>Hotel de Digoine</strong> Bourg Saint Andeol<br> (00 33 4 7554 6107; <a href=\"http://www.digoine.com\">www.digoine.com</a>) From \u20ac85-\u20ac110 for a double ; table d'h\u00f4te \u20ac19pp </p> <p> The recently opened Digoine gets the prize for the most original design in the Ard\u00e8che. The region was a major producer of silk cocoons and this sumptuous 18th-century silk merchant's palace has been transformed into a luxury residence decorated in bright colours. Each room is furnished to reflect a different stretch of the Silk Road, from China to the Middle East, Venice to Samarkand. A wonderful old kitchen doubles as the breakfast room where fresh fruit salad and hot waffles smothered with local honey are served. Instead of the traditional table d'h\u00f4te dinner, they serve lighter tapas accompanied by a serious wine tasting with each meal, to introduce guests to local vintages of chardonnay, merlot and syrah. </p> <p>A short drive out of Bourg St And\u00e9ol, you can be standing at the edge of La Madeleine, a lookout over the Ard\u00e8che gorges a thousand feet below; or wandering around the Mus\u00e9e de la Lavande at Ste-Remeze - an ancient lavender distillery transformed into an excellent museum that shows how lavender perfume is made. </p> <p><strong>Lamades</strong> Burzet<br></p> <p> (00 33 4 7594 5950; email:<a href=\"mailto:pierre.lievens@free.fr\">pierre.lievens@free.fr</a>) From \u20ac50-\u20ac89 for a double; table d'h\u00f4te \u20ac25pp </p> <p> This rambling building, beside a fast-flowing mountain stream that cascades into a rocky waterfall, was once a silkworm farm. It has been converted into a rabbit's warren of colourful guest rooms. The owners used to run a restaurant and the lengthy evening meal is a serious gastronomic affair, taking place around a long wooden table laid out with antique porcelain and crystal wine glasses. Be prepared for wonderful dishes, among them nettle and chestnut soup followed by rabbit and wild mushroom stew. </p> <p>On a Friday morning, make sure to stop off at the weekly market in nearby Thueys, then follow the signs for the Pont du Diable, a medieval stone bridge across a narrow gorge where you can also go swimming down by the river bank. </p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e1teau de Liviers</strong> Lyas<br> (00 33 4 7564 6400; <a href=\"http://www.chteau-de-liviers.com\">www.ch\u00e1teau-de-liviers.com</a>) \u20ac57 for a double; table d'h\u00f4te \u20ac17pp </p> <p> Although the immense 12th-century Chteau de Liviers looks like the most impressive of the chambres d'h\u00f4tes, it has not been renovated as much as the others. It offers simpler accommodation and hearty rustic meals at considerably lower prices. The site, though, is magnificent, and the castle is surrounded by its own 13 acres of park and woodland. This area is a goldmine for antique hunters and anyone out for flea-market bargains should turn up early on a Sunday morning in the town of Privas, while at the village of Meysse there is a vast warehouse, Aux Quatre Sous, one of the biggest brocantes (bric-a-brac stores) in France. </p> <p><strong>Le Couradou</strong> Labastide de Virac<br> (00 33 4 7538 6475; <a href=\"http://www.lecouradou.com\">www.lecouradou.com</a>) From \u20ac78-\u20ac121 for a double; table d'h\u00f4te \u20ac28pp </p> <p> Le Couradou is a 15th-century mas (farmhouse) on a hill overlooking the photo genic hamlet of Labastide de Virac.

Guests can visit the source of the Loire then hike up the Mont-Gerbier-de-Jonc for unparalled views as far as the Alps or trek to the Ray-Pic cascade, a 60-metre waterfall. If all this sounds like too much exercise, bear in mind that the evening meals here are gargantuan.

  "<p>When you're relaxing by the hotel pool browsing the cocktail menu, spare a thought for the staff who wait on you: they may well be working long hours for poverty wages, says Tourism Concern.

They interviewed workers at hotels featured by Thomson, First Choice, Thomas Cook and Airtours. </p> <p>'We went to a variety of destinations and the labour issues were consistent in each, with low wages and low levels of unionisation.

  "<p>Buy three Rolexes, said the sign, and get one free. Since one watch cost just 110 Bulgarian leva - that's about \u00a338 - you'd be better off picking up a few spares rather than paying for regular repairs. </p> <p>Cheaper still were the Swatches, at just over \u00a36 ('Four for the price of three!'). Top-name perfumes, too: Kenzo, Calvin Klein, Armani, all little more than \u00a34. Sure, the sample bottles looked - and smelt - dodgy, and giving one to your sweetheart would probably earn you a smack in the face, but the quality of the counterfeit cardboard packaging was superb. </p> <p>With prices such as these, Bulgaria is positioning itself as the new bargain basement of skiing. Andorra has happily given up its claim to the title, having invested heavily in its facilities in pursuit of a wealthier clientele - although its duty-free shops are still crammed full of cut-price goodies. The 'luxuries' in Bulgaria may be fake, but if the prices are low enough the Balkans could easily become the new Pyrenees. </p> <p>One thing the Bulgarian resort of Borovets certainly does not have to fake is novelty value. My hotel, the Rila, was a 250-room leviathan dating from the communist 1970s. The vast lobby felt like a cross between a leisure centre and a shopping mall. Women in bikinis on their way to the indoor pool sashayed past outlets selling everything from fake watches to fake jewellery and fake DVDs. An artist sketched caricatures of visiting skiers. One stall was offering a novel alternative to messing about on skis: buy a white ceramic figure, and then paint it yourself (from \u00a31 for a small frog, up to a garden-size gnome for \u00a317, paints included). </p> <p>Up in the room there was still a whiff of pre-glasnost hospitality: a shower that spluttered and gasped, an old and ripped shower curtain, and a curious noise coming out of the bath plughole, reminiscent of the soundtrack of a spaghetti western. But no shortage of space: two vast double beds, and a balcony with a view out over the pine trees and the alleyway below - a sea of corrugated iron roofs, with a dusting of snow over a shanty-town mix of greens, reds and yellows. </p> <p>Other hotels scattered among the pines appeared after the country abandoned communism in 1989; some of the homes, though, go back to the days of the tsars. One of them belongs to a certain Simeon Sakskoburggotski. If the name sounds familiar, it could be because he belongs to the pan-European Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty, which has put bums on thrones from Lisbon to Brussels to Windsor. </p> <p>Like our own royals, he is a keen skier, though he has been rather more successful at reinventing himself with the times. Booted out of the country in 1946 at the age of nine, Tsar Simeon II did 55 years in exile before performing a spectacular piece of personal repackaging and returning in 2001 as Prime Minister. He's the first former monarch to return to power in a democratic election (watch out, Gordon Brown: Charlie Windsor might beat you to it). </p> <p>Simeon's lodge is one of several here that have been restored to their former owners after decades of state control. For Borovets first became popular at the end of the 19th century, when the royals and assorted aristocrats built hunting lodges among the pine woods about a mile above sea level on the slopes of Mount Musala, the highest mountain in the Balkan peninsula. Now Borovets is the country's biggest ski resort. </p> <p>I didn't spot any royalty, reincarnated or otherwise, on the slopes, but I did come across an exceptional number of giant furry animals. Pandas, bears, rabbits, foxes, cats - they have a habit of shuffling up to you as you struggle with your boots and bindings, putting an arm round you just as their photographer sidekick snaps a picture, which you can buy at the end of the day in your hotel lobby. At times you feel as though all the giant cuddly animals ever pensioned off from the West's big theme parks have ended up on this mountain, to work their way through retirement. </p> <p>Further down the slopes you're less likely to be accosted by oversize squirrels than by taxi drivers, who gather wherever a piste comes close to a road to shout for custom. Standing close to their yellow motors - mostly variations on an Eighties Lada theme - they yell 'Taxi!' as you ski past, just in case you want a lazy lift back to your forest lodge. </p> <p>On one score Borovets beats any other ski resort I have visited: the number of colours it uses on its piste map. Most ski areas content themselves with three - blue/red/black, to denote runs that are easy/intermediate/expert. Some have an extra-easy green level thrown in. Here you get five - though it took me some time on the mountain before I worked out that yellow stands for Not Built Yet. </p> <p>The new runs due to open this season should double the length of piste to 80 kilometres. Because the resort is so far south (about level with Rome), the treeline is high, so most of the runs are through thick pine forest; even at the top, at 2,560 metres, you're skiing among dwarf trees. All in all the 1,200m vertical drop is served by a couple of chairs, a dozen-odd button lifts, and a 4.8km-long gondola - first thing in the morning it had the longest lift queue I've ever seen. (That's where the taxis come in: ride up to mid-mountain, where lift queues are non-existent.) </p> <p>Some of the runs are quite technical: a couple are approved to hold international giant slalom races, and the resort has twice hosted Alpine World Cup events. If the more ambitious dreamers around here have their way, when Sofia wins the contest to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, Borovets will be the venue for the main skiing and snowboarding events. </p> <p>Whether or not it succeeds in winning over the world's top winter-sports athletes, Borovets is certainly pulling in skiers with an eye for a cheap deal. Unlike many Alpine resorts, you needn't blow a fortune on the mountain: a plate of spaghetti bolognese at a mountain restaurant, say, costs around \u00a33. And a big meal - like those at the folklore shows, complete with suckling pigs roasting over a spit, mountains of side dishes, a bottle of wine each and surprisingly good traditional music and dancing, costs around \u00a314. (With hotel-package food tending towards central European, ex-communist stodginess, you will want to eat out now and again.) </p> <p>Biggest bargains of all, perhaps, are the bars. Vodka-tonics, for example, came in at just over \u00a31; more often than not, we were served two for the price of one. Happy hours seem to come around so frequently that when you do get just one drink for your money, you feel as though you've hit unhappy hour by mistake. </p> <p>So, what's the verdict? Compared with the Alps or the Pyrenees, the ski area is small, and the lifts antiquated; if you're after a high-mileage ski holiday, go elsewhere. Do consider Bulgaria, though, if you're a cost-conscious beginner. Or if, like me, you find that holidays to most Alpine resorts are becoming depressingly alike: a ski trip here is guaranteed to be quirky, unforgettable - and great value, too. </p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>James Bedding travelled to Bulgaria with Inghams (020 8780 4433, <a href=\"http://www.inghams.co.uk\">www.inghams.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>Four out of five buyers of new houses and flats are stuck with 'mediocre' and 'bland' properties, according to a campaign advising the public on what to consider when purchasing a new-build home. </p> <p>The campaign is the idea of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe), a government-funded design watchdog. Cabe audited 100 private housing estates built between 2000 and 2003 and scored them on their design and their suitability for their local areas. </p> <p>The builders analysed were Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Bovis, Bryant, Countryside, Fairview, George Wimpey, Laing, Persimmon, Ward Homes and Wilson Bowden. The survey reveals that: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 22 per cent of the schemes are 'poor' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> a further 61 per cent are merely 'average' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> only 17 per cent are 'good' or 'very good'. </p> <p>The survey has two main criticisms of developers. The first is that too often they allow cars, roads and the needs of drivers to dominate. In many estates any open space is treated as 'a technical area for storing and manoeuvring cars', the audit says. </p> <p>The second is that outside London there have been few attempts to use local materials or regional designs, so new residential areas are 'relatively indistinguishable from each other, without a true sense of place'. </p> <p>With the Government committed to creating 200,000 new homes in the next 15 years, the report is outspoken about what it sees as a trend towards quantity over quality. 'We will not settle for mediocre. If we carry on this way, we will leave a sorry legacy for future generations. In our haste to build new homes, it would be a crime if future generations have to suffer the consequences of rushed design and a lack of ambition,' says Cabe commissioner Paul Finch. </p> <p>Cabe also criticises local councils for not creating detailed planning proposals for sites and for having too few skilled staff, thereby giving developers carte blanche. </p> <p>House builders have reacted predictably to the report. 'We welcome it. It's useful as far as it goes,' says Pierre Williams of the House Builders' Federation. He says the fact that only 22 per cent of developments have been branded as poor by such a rigorous body as Cabe actually suggests that design has improved in recent years. But he says the specific criticisms are unrealistic. 'Of course it would be nice to give less room to the car. But homebuyers' lifestyles depend on having one, because public transport is normally woefully inadequate,' he says. </p> <p>The HBF also says that the high level of national and local government intervention in house building - seen in recent years through regulations promoting higher-density, brownfield development, sustainability, building regulations and more rigorous health and safety legislation - inevitably leads to a great similarity between developments. </p> <p>'But even so developers use local vernacular styles and buyers vote with their feet demanding such things,' Williams insists. 'Perception lags behind reality - the claim that builders built boxes had some credence 10 years ago but absolutely not now.' </p> <p>Cabe insists that its audit is not an exercise in blame, and case studies within it demonstrate how well resourced local authorities can work with collaborative and creative housebuilders to deliver good housing. </p> <p>The commission says the public often buy poor-quality homes because they do not recognise designs that will cause problems in the future. The website gives extensive lists of tips on how to avoid similar pitfalls and suggests questions for people to ask staff and estate agents in show houses. </p> <p>Now Cabe wants this audit to kickstart a huge public consultation. The new website will allow people to check if their new home is included - if not, they will be encouraged to nominate it for a future audit and contribute anecdotal 'homes from hell' stories to the site. </p> <p>Developers, you have been warned.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty years ago this month a mini revolution happened in the investment trust industry: the first savings scheme was launched by Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust. It meant investors no longer had to buy investment trust shares through a stockbroker but could go direct to the investment trust manager, just as they did when buying a unit trust. </p> <p>This instantly made investment trusts cheaper and easier to access, and even today investment trust savings schemes remain one of the most cost-effective ways of investing in the stock market. </p> <p>Until 1984 investment trusts were not allowed to offer their own shares for sale because legislation prevented companies from promoting their own shares. But they needed to find a way around these laws, so they could drum up more business. They had been losing ground for some time as institutional investors had offloaded their shares in generalist investment trusts, causing the shares to develop big discounts. </p> <p>It was Michael Hart, legendary postwar investment manager of Foreign and Colonial, who had seen how savings schemes worked in the US and decided to introduce them here to encourage more private investors to buy shares. </p> <p>It has certainly been successful for Foreign and Colonial. In 1984 only 25 per cent of its shareholders were private investors; now they make up over 80 per cent of its investor base. Since then most investment trust managers have introduced savings schemes. Today they are offered by more than 40 groups giving access to more than 200 trusts. </p> <p>During the second quarter of this year \u00a345 million was invested via the schemes. Charles Cade, head of investment trust research at brokers Close Wins, says: 'Without investment trust savings schemes, global investment trusts would not have survived.' </p> <p>The attraction of the schemes for investors is that they can save as little as \u00a320 a month in a professionally managed portfolio of shares in a variety of trusts, ranging from global generalists to highly specialist trusts focusing on, say, the Far East or smaller UK companies. Charges are minimal. Many schemes have no initial charge at all, although investors do have to pay 0.5 per cent stamp duty. At most the cost of buying is 1 per cent. </p> <p>What is even more advantageous for savers is the low annual charges on investment trusts compared with other forms of saving. </p> <p>Latest figures from fund analyst Fitzrovia International show that nearly a third of conventional investment trusts have total expense ratios of less than 1 per cent, while for almost two thirds they are less than 1.5 per cent. By contrast, annual charges on unit trusts tend to start at 1.5 per cent. Other forms of saving schemes such as tax-exempt friendly society plans are also more expensive. </p> <p>Low charges do not, of course, guarantee good per formance. A comparison of the returns that would have been achieved by regular savers who had saved \u00a350 a month over the past 10 years shows mixed results. </p> <p>The top 10 performers are impressive. They would have turned the \u00a36,000 saved over the period into sums of between \u00a39,736 and \u00a315,940. But savers who had chosen the bottom performers would have been disappointed, as they would have ended up with less than they had put in. Global trusts, the most popular choice among regular savers, generally occupy the middle ground. </p> <p>Carolyn Corless of Bloomsbury Financial Planning, a self-confessed fan of investment trust savings schemes, says: 'They are ideal for modest savers or those putting money aside for children who want to invest long-term in the stock market because they are so low-cost. The big international trusts, such as Alliance, Foreign and Colonial and Witan, give a fantastic spread. They may underperform at times and they won't shoot the lights out - they are the steady-as-she-goes type of investments. But that is exactly what most savers want.' </p> <p><strong>\"This is India's Century\"</strong></p> <p>Alistair Elliott, 46, a consultant from Brighton, started saving \u00a3100 a month in JP Morgan Fleming's Indian investment trust four years ago. He says: 'I wanted to make some extra savings for my retirement. As I am already a member of a pension scheme, I decided to go for something more high-risk. My view is that countries like India and China have great prospects - this is going to be their century. I knew it was going to be a rollercoaster ride so I wasn't worried when the Indian stock market fell after the election earlier this year. I am in it for the long term, and I know that when the market goes down I get more for my money.'</p> <p><strong>Value of \u00a350 invested each month over 10 years </strong></p> <p>Top performers \u00a3 </p> <p>TR Property 15,940 </p> <p>Fidelity European Values 11,931 </p> <p>British Empire Securities 11,284 </p> <p>Hansa Trust 10,615 </p> <p>JP Morgan Fleming Indian 10,591</p> <p>Worst performers \u00a3 </p> <p>F&amp;C Pacific 5,225 </p> <p>HendersonStrata 5,131 </p> <p>Invesco City &amp; Commercial 4,816 </p> <p>Henderson Small Companies 4,719 </p> <p>Edinburgh Small Companies 3,909</p> <p>Source: AITC</p>",
  "<p>'My hero, my solicitor' is the unlikely slogan for a poster campaign designed to impress upon an uncaring British public just how wonderful lawyers are. 'Hero' certainly isn't the word that David Smith would choose to sum up his feelings towards his lawyer. 'His opinion turned out not to be worth the paper it was written on.' </p> <p>Smith is one of approximately 16,000 people who each year contact the Law Society, the profession's representative body, to complain about shoddy service. He has been a television engineer since 1968, working for the same high-street retailer for more than 30 years. Over that period Smith, like many long-serving colleagues, had permanently damaged his back lugging TVs around. The extent of the harm only came to light when he slipped a disc in 1980 reaching down to pick up a pen. He has never properly recovered. </p> <p>'It sounds daft, but I didn't connect slipping my disc with what I do for a living,' he says. 'It was only when an increasing number of my colleagues had similar problems, and medical evidence came to light connecting back problems with lifting at work, that it finally clicked.' </p> <p>In fact, it was not until April 2000 that Smith, together with five workmates, tried to sue his employers for not providing them with any guidance or equipment for their job. They contacted their trade union which put them in touch with its lawyers. And then what happened? </p> <p>'Well, nothing really. They just procrastinated, stalled and - to be perfectly honest - didn't appear to care,' he says. 'Months passed, then years and I didn't even get to see a doctor, all I got was the lawyer's opinion. Then last year I was shocked to discover that it was too late.' His claim was statute-barred, meaning that three years had passed since he had knowledge of a possible claim and he had run out of time to bring the legal action. </p> <p>Understandably, Smith is deeply angry about his lawyer's inaction and has since complained to the firm and then the Law Society. After months of wrangling he was offered \u00a3250 compensation for the loss of his claim. 'It's just a pittance isn't it?' he says. 'But I felt that it was a case of \"take it or leave it\". So I took it.' </p> <p>The Law Society's less-than-heroic track-record on complaints has dogged the profession for years. In fact, it could well be its undoing. Sir David Clementi, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, is conducting a review of regulation of the legal profession which reports in December. Which?, the consumers' association, reckons the profession's inability to deal with unhappy clients is 'the greatest threat to self-regulation'. </p> <p>On top of that, ministers announced last month that the Law Society could face a fine of \u00a31 million if it failed to turn the problem around. The power to impose the fine would be exercised by the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner, Zahida Manzoor, who is also the Legal Services Ombudsman. </p> <p>'The Law Society's track record on complaints unfortunately hasn't been good,' Manzoor says. This year she was happy with only 53 per cent of the cases that came to her office, well short of the 75 per cent target set by the Department of Constitutional Affairs (as well as being down from a 67 per cent satisfaction rating last year). 'That means that I'm finding against the society in almost every other case.' </p> <p>Manzoor is convinced that the time is ripe for a split between the Law Society's regulatory and trade union roles: 'I always use the analogy of the society being the England football manager and referee at the same time. Your side is playing in a crucial game against France then something happens - do you throw up a red card or don't you? You can't be both.' Manzoor would like to see independent regulation, plus an independent complaints-handling organisation, standing 'at the apex of a new regulatory regime'. </p> <p>Solicitors have made efforts to placate critics. Two years ago, the Law Society's ruling body agreed to devote \u00a321 million to improve complaints handling and has since set up a 50-strong practice standards unit that trains law firms to deal with complaints. This year it is aiming to visit 1,300 firms. The society also overhauled its complaints system, scrap ping the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors and introducing the Consumer Complaints Service. </p> <p>However, it seems wildly optimistic for lawyers to expect the public to regard them as 'heroes'. 'Solicitors come in for a lot of bad press and people only ever remember the bad things,' says Janet Paraskeva, the Law Society's chief executive. 'But when you look at the number of complaints, although those numbers sound high, one has to bear in mind there are 15 million transactions a year.' That averages out as one complaint against every solicitor every five years, she argues. </p> <p>But lawyers will have an uphill battle to persuade ministers and the public that they have cleaned up their act. Research from Which?, based on 321 people who claimed to have had poor treatment at the hands of lawyers, has found that 40 per cent of respondents did not even bother making a complaint. Many thought that it would be a waste of time because the legal profession was, as one put it, 'a closed shop'. </p> <p>'Almost all of those who complained said they were unhappy with the way the complaints were dealt with and almost three-quarters said their complaints were not actually resolved,' reports Andrea Barton, the researcher who wrote the report. The Law Society points out respondents were 'self-selecting', insofar as only those clients who had grievances contacted the researchers. </p> <p><strong>How to complain about your solicitor</strong></p> <p>What do you do if you have a dodgy solicitor? 'Firstly, you need to take your complaint up with the solicitor in question and if you aren't satisfied then you need to go to their complaints officer,' advises Andrea Barton, of Which?, formerly the Consumers' Association. </p> <p>The number one problem with solicitors, it found, was 'excessive delay' and two-thirds of the respondents claimed that they weren't given any sort of estimate of how long the claims might take. </p> <p>'We would recommend that before you decide to go with a solicitor that you get everything in writing: how long the case is likely to take and how much it might cost,' Barton says. 'We also recommend that you ask to be billed at regular intervals so you can keep tabs on mounting costs.' </p> <p>At the start of every transaction with a lawyer, there should be a client care letter setting out the terms of the agreement. More than half of the people in the survey claimed to have had no costs estimate and only one quarter had received it in writing. </p> <p>If the problem can not be resolved with the firm, you should contact the Law Society's Consumer Complaints Service as soon as possible. 'The quicker that a complaint is dealt with the better,' says Geoffrey Negus, a Law Society spokesman. 'There's also a cut-off point. You must contact us within six months of the end of the work the solicitor did for you, or within six months of the solicitor's final response to your complaint.' </p> <p>The Law Society can order the solicitor to do the work again, cut or scrap the bill, as well as make the solicitor pay compensation of up to \u00a35,000. Awards are typically about \u00a3250. </p> <p>Negus explains that award represents compensation for 'inadequacy of service' and not to compensate, for example, for loss of the right to sue - as in David Smith's case. Also bear in mind that you can't receive compensation for negligence from the Law Society and, if that is the case, you might have to use another lawyer to sue your original firm of solicitors. </p> <p>The society points out that the latest figures show that about two-thirds of all cases (64 per cent), are resolved within three months. </p> <p>If all else fails, then there is always Zahida Manzoor, the Legal Services Ombudsman. Last year she looked at 2,130 cases. She can recommend the Law Society pay compensation, and reconsider its decision, as well as formally criticise. Her advice for clients who believe they've had a rough deal? 'Be persistent,' she says. 'Remember it's your right to have your complaint investigated and you should pursue it because, hopefully, it can be mediated and conciliated to everyone's satisfaction.'</p>",
  "Scientists fear the graves of their relatives will be the next target of animal rights extremists following the desecration of the burial ground of 82-year-old Gladys Hammond. <p>As hundreds of mourners gathered yesterday for a service of rededication in the Staffordshire village churchyard where her body was stolen, representatives of leading drug firms involved in animal research admitted that the remains of their ancestors may be next in line. </p> <p>Richard Ley, spokesman for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: 'How many ancestors are they going to go back? Where does it end? There is an implied threat in all this for us, but it is impossible to defend every graveyard.' </p> <p>Although police are still searching for the culprits, sources with the Animal Liberation Front refuse to condemn the macabre act which yesterday appeared on a website dedicated to glorifying the activities of extremists. Officers believe Mrs Hammond's grave in the burial ground of St Peter's church in Yoxall was removed because of family links to a farm in Newchurch which breeds guinea pigs for medical research. </p> <p>However last night the owners of the farm vowed they would not be forced to close the business, dubbed an 'animal Auschwitz' by activists. Instead they have erected a security fence, employed night-time watchmen and introduced guard dogs. Chris Hall, the son-in-law of Mrs Hammond, said: 'They claim that we ritually abuse animals for our own pleasure. I can assure you that doesn't happen.' </p> <p>Candles held by villagers spluttered in the breeze while flowers adorned every grave to mark the bereavement of all those whose loved ones had lain in a place that, until now, had been fondly known for its serenity. Such sentiments were vanquished the moment Mrs Hammond's coffin was raised under the cover of darkness 10 days ago and her remains stolen. Where they were taken is still a mystery. </p> <p>Animal welfare protesters were forced to cancel, on police advice, a planned demonstration against the farm just hours before yesterday's rededication ceremony. The rector of Yoxall, the Reverend Jenny Lister, said she hoped the service would reclaim the sanctity in the churchyard. </p> <p>'There was a need to do something to bring back a sense of peace and dignity to the churchyard and the cemetery,' she said. </p> <p>Conspicuously absent, however, from those that gathered to hear her sermon was the family of Chris Hall. </p> <p>Since her grave was violated, none of the family has summoned the strength to visit the graveyard. 'It's just too emotional at the moment,' said Chris. </p> <p>However the decision not close Darley Oak Farm is a rare setback for the increasingly influential animal rights movement. </p> <p>A primate research centre at Cambridge was abandoned because of the excessive costs of protecting staff. Scientists warn Britain's dominant position in the pharmaceutical industry is at risk. </p> <p>This week the ABPI will analyse the latest figures on attacks by animal extremists over the three months since the Home Office introduced new regulations to tackle protesters. The Observer has seen figures compiled by extremists which reveal that although the number of attacks has decreased following the crackdown, their frequency is likely to prompt fresh calls from industry for legislation to protect scientists. During July, August and September there were 34 attacks compared to 51 in the preceding three months. </p> <p>Today the hunt for the Yoxall grave robbers will continue. Midlands activist John Curtin has been arrested and released on police bail. Curtin condemns the act as 'revolting' and denies he did it.</p>",
  "<p>Traditionally, young, blonde, ex-model Australian actresses who take their first faltering steps into the limelight via the medium of Neighbours do not end up as the darlings of the American indie scene. Pop stars? Quite possibly. Pantomime leads? Almost certainly. Embraced by the dark, edgy, Sundance-approved fringes of the movie industry? Absolutely not. Unless, it seems, they're Radha Mitchell. </p> <p>Despite looking like a younger Sharon Stone, giggling habitually like a tipsy coquette and having starred as two different characters in Australia's leading soap opera, over the last eight years Mitchell has established herself as a versatile and accomplished fixture on the moody art-house flick circuit. She launched her assault on the indie scene by 'cornering the market on the lesbian ingenue' - first as Danni in Emma-Kate Croghan's directorial debut Love and Other Catastrophes, then as Syd in Lisa Cholodenko's loudly acclaimed High Art. 'After that, I was offered lots of lesbian roles, but I didn't want them because I'd already played the best there was,' she says earnestly. And then she giggles. From then on, she majored in 'independent films, different roles', systematically demolishing the spectre of Neighbours. She wrote, directed and starred in a black-and-white movie called Four Reasons, and broke out into the mainstream a little playing Colin Farrell's wife in 2002's unnerving Phone Booth. </p> <p>Over the next few months, Mitchell will come as close as she's capable to being a ubiquitous presence in our multiplexes, appearing in three enormously different films, each of which is relatively high profile. She co-stars alongside Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet in Finding Neverland, a fictionalised version of how JM Barrie came to write Peter Pan (out later this month); opposite Denzel Washington in Man on Fire, a harrowing portrayal of the kidnapping industry in Mexico City (out now); and as both Melinda and Melinda in Woody Allen's new film, Melinda and Melinda (out in January). </p> <p>Is she prepared for the increased exposure? 'Um, not sure. I never wanted to be a movie star. I'd definitely rather be rich than famous.'</p> <p>She had, she thinks, the defining Woody Allen experience on the set of Melinda and Melinda. 'He doesn't like to rehearse. Most of the cast didn't have the script, they didn't even know who they were in the film. And I thought for the first two days: God, I'm fired, for sure I'm fired - because he wasn't talking to me, he was just saying: \"Action\" and \"Cut.\" And you hear all these stories about, like, actors go on set one day and then the next day they're gone and someone else is in there, playing their part. But then I realised he had a very casual attitude towards shooting. Like he'd ask us if we'd finished yet, because he wanted to go and have a bath. And then literally would go home after, like, two takes: \"No, you were great!\" That was the environment he was creating. That's what Woody Allen movies are about: anxiety, anticipation, uncertainty.'</p> <p>Mitchell grew up in Melbourne, in a family environment she'll only describe as 'very unusual. I think my parents see my life now as very conservative.' She won't elaborate, frustratingly. 'I don't feel like going there. It wasn't bad. I just had lots of experiences that sheltered children wouldn't have,' she's said in the past. Now, all she'll add is: 'My mum had a clothing store, and we'd go on trips to India for fabrics...' which isn't all that unconservative.</p> <p>Mitchell had no burning acting ambitions as a child. 'No. But I was certainly... enthusiastic. I had a friend, and we always used to pretend to be twins. We had this fantasy about going to Hollywood together. We were about four. But how did it all end up as it is now? Well, I think because I did Love and Other Catastrophes and then I realised that there was some kind of possibility there, and you don't waste it... Because in Australia there really isn't a lot to do. There aren't a lot of opportunities.'</p> <p>There was always, however, Neighbours. Is the soap mandatory for aspiring Australian actors? <br> 'It probably is,' Mitchell says. 'I think everybody should be subjected to it. It's incredibly boring.'<br> How awful is it?<br> 'The first two months I was on it, I had fun. I hadn't worked much, so when it came up, I was: \"Wow!\" And the guy who I had all my scenes with, he was about to get axed from the show, so he had a passion to stay on. So we were the only people ever in the history of Neighbours to rehearse.'</p> <p>Mitchell has lived in LA for seven years. There, she dips in and out of Australian expat society ('Sometimes I hang out with Naomi [Watts] and Heath [Ledger]. I don't really know Guy [Pearce]') and she may or may not have a boyfriend. 'That's too private. I'd rather talk about my bank balance.' She'd also rather talk about the pressure of plastic surgery. 'For Man on Fire the director rang me and asked if I was going to cut my mole off, if I wouldn't mind. I was really kind of put out. I suddenly found that I have this very strong attachment to my mole.'</p> <p>For her next project, Rahda Mitchell's contemplating more genre-subverting activities. 'I'm maybe going to be a vampire. Although they've said: You can't have a blonde vampire. The director said: Do you want to dye your hair? But I don't. I want to be a blonde vampire. Catherine Deneuve was a blonde vampire, and she was my favourite vampire ever.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Finding Neverland is out on 29 October</p>",
  "<p>With its incidence predicted to double over the next decade, diabetes has attracted more medical and media attention of late. Last month, press reports appeared after doctors recommended more regular blood-sugar level checks for diabetics. Diabetics have also been urged to have more frequent assessments of a blood component known as HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin), the level of which gives a good guide to blood-sugar control over the preceding few months. This call has come as a result of recent research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine which shows a strong link between raised levels of HbA1c and increased risk of killer conditions common in diabetes, namely heart disease and stroke.</p> <p>According to a review in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, one key to keeping blood-sugar and HbA1c levels in check is to avoid foods that give brisk and extensive release of sugar into the bloodstream. Such foods (with a 'high glycaemic index') include the normal fare viewed as undesirable for diabetics, such as sweet drinks, chocolate, biscuits and cakes. </p> <p>Instead, diabetics are advised to eat starchy carbohydrates such as bread, potatoes, rice, pasta and cereals. Unfortunately, almost all such foods have glycaemic indices on the high side. Also, when refined or processed, they tend to be bereft of fibre, which is beneficial for tempering blood-sugar and HbA1c levels. Bearing in mind the disruptive effects of foods with a high glycaemic index and low in fibre, it seems odd that these are the very foods advocated for diabetics.</p> <p>Those looking to get fibre-rich and low-glycaemic fuel for their bodies may get them from starches such as oats and wholewheat pasta, in addition to beans, lentils, and green and salad vegetables. The high-protein, low-carb nature of chicken (preferably organic), lamb, fish, nuts and seeds makes them unlikely to contribute to elevated levels of blood sugar or HbA1c.</p> <p>Last month, the journal Diabetes published a study in which a higher-protein diet was pitted against a traditional carb-rich diet in a group of diabetics. Despite the relatively short duration of each diet (five weeks), the protein-based diet led to reduced levels of both blood-sugar and HbA1c. It was estimated that such a diet would lead to normalisation of HbA1c levels. </p> <p>The application of the findings of the recent Annals study reveals that this would be expected to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke by 40 per cent. This latest research utterly mirrors my experience in practice: a diet based on meat, fish, beans, lentils, nuts and vegetables other than the potato - not starchy carbohydrates - enables diabetics to ward off bad blood.</p>",
  "<p>I have always been a high-heel kinda girl. Shooting on location in the Scottish Highlands, I have been known to wear a kitten-heel boot while marching across marshes. Heels are not just a fashion statement - they're a leg-shape and height-thing. I know that if I want to feel elegant in a knee-length skirt, a heel helps. But when I was in Milan recently, I had an unfortunate accident in a pair of stilettos on a cobbled street. I twisted my ankle - no high heels for me for the remainder of the busy show schedule. This may seem like a small dilemma in the scheme of world problems, but on the fashion circuit it was a potential disaster.</p> <p>Of all the seasons for this to happen, it had to be this, the season of lady-like, round-toe, 4in high heels and knee-high boots with a three-quarter-length zip - none of which does a lot to support a swollen ankle. </p> <p>For the past two weeks, deprived of heels, I have found myself fixating on other people's feet. The front row crowd was shod in this season's new purchases from Prada, Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent - stilettos sparkling with jewels, shiny gold and molto elegant.

  "<p>Truly original thought has nothing whatever to do with our genes. In the Seventies Professor Liam Hudson published studies showing that post-doctoral researchers with firsts were actually less successful than those with 2.1s and 2.2s. Given what it takes to get a first, this should not be surprising. You need to please your teachers, enjoy being supervised closely and please the examiners, concentrating on what they want. To do research and succeed as an academic, you need the opposite: think originally, be highly self-motivated rather than craving constant praise and be able to work alone for long periods. </p> <p>True, trainee accountants with firsts or 2.1s (65 per cent) are more likely than 2.2s or thirds (41 per cent) to pass their accountancy exams. But that does not prove that the ones with better degrees are more likely to get to the top of those professions. Large organisations like the civil service or retailers which have developed ways of picking winners are less concerned with degree class than performance in their in-house psychometric tests. A survey of 254 leading companies showed that 71 per cent thought exam results a poor guide to an individual's abilities at work.</p> <p>If academic performance does not predict who will become a high achiever, then what does? Contrary to the unceasing torrent of claims for the role of genes, the evidence does not support them. Although studies of identical twins suggest IQ performance is half heritable, there are strong reasons to doubt their validity (see The Gene Illusion, by J Joseph). Even if genes determine IQ to a large extent, people with exceptionally high IQs are no more likely to succeed in their careers than those in the above-average but not-exceptional category (with an IQ around 120). A follow-up study of 400 Americans who had IQs of 150 or more (the average is 100) in childhood did not find that they had unusually successful careers for people of their class and educational background.</p> <p>If you take the twin studies' findings as valid, they do not show a big role for genes in determining many key skills for high achievement. Some personality traits are heritable, like extroversion and emotionality (40 per cent), but many are not, like sociability (25 per cent). Crucial mental abilities - memory and exam ability (32 per cent), creativity (25 per cent) - are not very heritable.</p> <p>'He's not very bright' is one of the thickest things a person can say in explaining someone's performance. Most of the time, it means that the person is not very good at the social skills required for career success - Machiavellianism, charm - or is not highly motivated. </p> <p>One of the strongest crude predictors of getting to the top is a preparedness to hop between jobs. High achievers show less loyalty to companies and make more career changes (likewise, surprise, surprise, such people are also more likely to be sexually unfaithful).</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> See Oliver James's books They F*** You Up (\u00a37.99, Bloomsbury) and Britain on the Couch (\u00a38.99, Arrow) for references to studies mentioned here.</p>",
  "<p>'A masterpiece,' Tim Adams called it in this newspaper, and many people anticipate that on Tuesday, the judges will agree and award the Man Booker Prize to Alan Hollinghurst's fourth novel, The Line Of Beauty. Elegant, erudite and studded with plenty of racketty gay sex, the book takes up where Hollinghurst's first novel, The Swimming-Pool Library, left off, in the mid-1980s, and charts the high water marks of Thatcherism and Aids, and the sickness and scummy disillusionment they left behind. </p> <p>The Swimming-Pool Library, which was published in 1988, was described by Edmund White as 'the best book about gay life yet written by an English author'. Exhilaratingly libidinous, full of pre-Aids pleasure, it appeared with a tremendous sense of shock. The novelist Philip Hensher was 22 when it was published and recalls its impact: 'I remember coming down from university to London to buy it as soon as possible. It was extremely important to my generation: before that, you couldn't imagine a gay novel about gay life appealing to anyone else.' </p> <p>Hollinghurst followed with The Folding Star in 1994, which was also short listed for the Booker, and The Spell in 1998. He writes, he has said, 'at walking pace', a rate of 300 to 400 words a day, or perhaps none. His close friend Andrew Motion remarks: 'I sometimes ask him, \"What have you been doing today?\" and he says, \"thinking\".' </p> <p>Hollinghurst was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 1954 and grew up around Cirencester, where his parents - his father was a bank manager, and he was their only child - encouraged his enthusiasm for listening to music. After public school at Canford, in Dorset, Hollinghurst went to Magdalen College, Oxford. He won the Newdigate Prize for poetry the year before Andrew Motion. 'My first impressions, which got stronger as I knew him, were that he was exceptionally clever,' Motion recalls, 'with an extraordinary range of cultural knowledge. And he spoke extremely elegantly, rather as he writes, with developed periods and an unfading, steady sense of the high style.' </p> <p>They subsequently shared a house for a couple of years, where Motion picked up some of his friend's knowledge of romantic music. 'It was one of the happiest times of my life,' Motion says. 'We were quite worky. He was writing a novel, which in the end he didn't offer for publication. At weekends we often went off to look at houses. We kept the National Trust going all by ourselves. And we established a pattern we've kept up since, of showing each other any work we plan to offer for publication. He has fantastically good taste and judgment. I don't know what I'd do, if not for him: if he thinks it's all right then that's good enough for me. I don't have to care what anyone else thinks.' </p> <p>Motion bought The Swimming-Pool Library when he was editorial director of Chatto: 'I knew it was going to be good, but I was flabbergasted by how brilliant it was.' Hollinghurst became godfather to Motion's eldest child. </p> <p>By this time, Hollinghurst was working at the Times Literary Supplement. There is a sense in his books of life opening up for young people in London, and his friends suggest that this was very much his experience, and that it accelerated following the publication of his first novel. </p> <p>'Before The Swimming-Pool Library , it didn't seem to me that being Alan and being gay was particularly happy. A lot of it revolved around opera,' says Alan Jenkins of the TLS . 'After it, life became a sort of party. He had a bit of success and money, and every gay man in the world had read and admired his book. That opened up a range of possibilities that hadn't been there before.' </p> <p>With his passion for Wagner, his enthusiasm for architecture and his cheerful ignorance of much popular culture (although the clubbing means he can display odd flashes of knowledge about garage) Hollinghurst can seem to be a rather austere, Olympian figure. </p> <p>'His monastic routines when he's writing don't easily accommodate the scheduling of soap opera,' says Stephen Pickles, who shared the house in Oxford before Motion returned from Hull. </p> <p>Hollinghurst is quite reserved: self-possessed, one friend said, without much small talk at the outset, and he has a deep, impressive voice, which can make him seem forbidding. He also knows a scary amount about literature: he used to edit Nemo's Almanac, an abstruse annual competition for literary nerds, which involves identifying obscure bits of writing, mainly by poets no one remembers. </p> <p>He still does the competition, and 'he'll say things like, \"seven eluded me\", when I've spent three months on it and only got one,' notes Peter Strauss, who bought The Line of Beauty when he was at Picador (he is now an agent). 'And then he'll tell me that was wrong.' </p> <p>Part of the pleasure of Hollinghurst's writing lies in the tension between the impeccably modulated prose and the pleasurably filthy things people get up to. It's difficult to imagine how, in life, he squares these sides of himself: the exquisitely discerning, intellectual Hollinghurst and the clubbing one. He has never gone out dancing all that often: once a month perhaps; but he has enthused about the pleasures of taking Ecstasy when he does. </p> <p>It's possible that he manages by keeping the worlds entirely separate. Andrew Motion says he is 'extraordinarily compartmentalised'. Stephen Pickles says: 'I don't know about Ecstasy or clubbing. I'm not interested in those things and he doesn't talk about them, or not to me.' </p> <p>The central characters of The Swimming-Pool Library and The Line of Beauty both suffer unrequited passions for handsome young contemporaries who are barely aware of their lustful fantasies. </p> <p>Both books also feature urgent, exhilarating sex with working-class black men. This seems not to be a million miles away from life. 'For quite a while, he could be depended on to like boys who didn't like boys,' Alan Jenkins comments, 'and he's always liked and fancied black boys. He's had long-term affairs and he's still close to those boys. They haven't all been working class by any means: they've been heterogeneous in that sense; but they have tended to be black.' </p> <p>Probably the main strain of criticism of Hollinghurst is that his characters aren't likeable enough, that if there is feeling in his novels, then it's too deeply suppressed. For some, there isn't a tension between the visceral sex and the highly developed perceptions, merely a sense that both lack emotional heft. 'If he does write a book that gives you someone really to care about, writers will have to make a bonfire of their nibs,' Adam Mars-Jones says. </p> <p>But those who know him insist that underneath the erudition and the witty, high-camp banter, he is emotional; indeed, that he's a person of particularly deep emotion. 'He's a loving person,' says Alan Jenkins. 'He's very loyal. He's not promiscuous: he falls in love with people and he's had terrible heartbreaks and unhappiness. Love and affection is very central in his life and I'm sure he'd like that to figure in his domestic life.' </p> <p>Andrew Motion considers that Hollinghurst has 'a great capacity for joy and happiness', but doesn't believe that his intensely romantic nature naturally or inevitably leads to desire for completion by another person. 'I asked him once whether he was lonely and he said he has never been lonely. His sense of self is very centred.' </p> <p>It is probably the case that with his impeccably organised flat in Hampstead, his views over the Heath, his walks, his large and varied circle of friends, Hollinghurst has, as Motion believes, life set up pretty much as he wants it; and yet, the books are full of yearning. </p> <p>He writes about a gay world of uncertain possibilities and tenuous connections, 'where happiness can depend on the glance of a stranger, caught and held.' He is, as Stephen Pickles notes in a more general context, 'fascinated by what's over the wall, a secret garden thing'. </p> <p>Pickles compares Hollinghurst's writing to a Renaissance painting, 'where there's a tiny little jetty in the background. Everything is done so well, right up to the little corner where you needn't put anything. That ultimately accounts for the pleasure: the books are substantial, and they shimmer.' Andrew Motion says he 'can't think of anybody who writes better line-by-line: weighed, scrupulous, thrilling, and charged.' </p> <p>Many people thought Hollinghurst should have won the Booker last time he was short listed; there were suspicions that the graphic descriptions of sex might have put off one or two of the judges. </p> <p>This week, a decade on, might just be his moment. </p> <p><strong> ALAN HOLLINGHURST</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB:</strong> 1954, Stroud, Gloucestershire </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Magdalen College, Oxford </p> <p><strong> Job:</strong> On the staff of the Times Literary Supplement, 1982 to 1995 </p> <p><strong> Books:</strong> Confidential Chats with Boys , The Swimming-Pool Library , The Spell , The Line of Beauty among others</p>",
  "Is Britain moving forwards or backwards? How people answer that question will help decide the outcome of the next general election. <p>And here is the oddest paradox. Ask most people whether they are proud of their country and they will almost certainly say yes. You'll get the same answer if you ask whether people's living standards are better than seven years ago. Or if their city, town or village is better. Or if the schools, surgeries and hospitals are improving. But personal optimism sits side by side with collective pessimism: people say their experience is better but wonder whether it is the same for others. The Tory strategy is to persuade people that a country that is winning is actually losing. </p> <p>To win a historic third term, New Labour has to break through the fog of doubt by challenging and beating the politics of pessimism. This week will see Tony Blair and his senior ministers do just that - on the economy, health, education and crime. It is part of a national battle Labour will wage to win back hope and confidence in Britain. </p> <p>Remember that bread-and-butter domestic issues - crime and jobs, health and education, childcare and pensions - win elections. Make sure the people's party is on the people's side. Labour exists for a simple reason - to make life better for hard-working families. People want to hear less of the arcane language of reform and more about how better childcare can help people balance work and family life or how local communities and the police can work together with new powers to beat crime and antisocial behaviour. In other words, talk the people's language, not the language of the Westminster village. </p> <p>See life through the prism of people's lives, not the news prism. Bill Clinton recently said that politicians mistakenly define their reality according to the day's media, whereas people judge politics according to their own lives. If the public really judged Labour according to much of the media, we would neither still be ahead in the polls nor as strong as we are. </p> <p>We should not be afraid to say Britain is working. It is. Look at any of our great cities - Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardiff, Birmingham, Bristol, London. For all the challenges they face, they are all buzzing. People in towns like Darlington - my constituency- take enormous pride in it and in its progress. So when that election campaign comes, Labour will need to emphasise local as well as national delivery. </p> <p>Labour should have the confidence to stand up against those who would run down Britain. It's not all down to government. We have some of the best musicians and artists in the world. We are a home to world-beating companies such as Nissan and Rolls-Royce. Our universities, financial services, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries lead Europe. </p> <p>Of course, not every problem has been solved. But we've got the strongest economy in Europe - and it will be centre stage in any election campaign. We also have the best record on jobs and more money going into our great public services when elsewhere it is being cut back. A reform programme is turning heads in Europe as Britain shows what a flexible economy and modernised services can bring. And with Britain strong and respected in the world - and hugely influential in Europe - we should be very confident about what we have achieved. </p> <p>Do not allow the election to become a comparison between a mythical party of perfection and the actual party of government. Instead, compare Labour's record with the Tories. There really is no comparison. Virtually no one describes the years before 1997 as the good old days. Then it was three million unemployed. Now it is two million more employed. Then it was 400,000 more on hospital waiting lists. Now it is almost 200,000 off. Then it was crime doubled. Now it's crime down by one quarter. Then it was the poll tax. Now it's the minimum wage. We tried it their way for 18 years. We've tried it ours for seven. Our way works better. </p> <p>Britain is going places but if we are to open up opportunities for all, we will need a radical third-term programme founded on Labour values. The ambitious five-year plans for health, education, crime and transport are a good start. This autumn, the government will launch plans for culture, enterprise and the environment. All draw a sharp contrast with the Tories. Labour policies put aspiration and opportunities in the hands of people, regardless of wealth. This is in contrast with Conservative policies to cut inheritance tax or subsidise patients to pay for private health, rewarding privilege. By taking the radical centre ground, Tony Blair has forced Michael Howard into the gravest of political errors - vacating the centre and taking his party, instead, to the right. </p> <p>So the battle is between optimism and pessimism. The Tories want to create a mood of negativism in the country so people will say yes, the economy is strong, but that has nothing to do with the government. Yes, there is a new school building round the corner, but that is the council, not the government. Yes, care at the local hospital might be better but that is not the government's doing. We should not over-claim our success. Much of the good that is happening in the country is down to individuals, to companies, to councils, to the decent people in our public services. Allow them to speak up for Britain's progress, too. </p> <p>Indeed, as long-standing problems are tackled, others gain prominence. Waiting lists are down - but there is MRSA. Crime is down - but gun crime is now a real concern. </p> <p>We have delivered a lot and have a lot more to give. We have a lot to be optimistic about. People know the reality and the progress in their own lives. Labour's task is to ensure they also make the connection with the choice they made to put Labour in power. Britain is working - we must not let the Conservatives wreck it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Milburn is former Secretary of State for Health, and MP for Darlington</p>",
  "<p>They have been described as feral children, real terrorists, thugs, yobs, vandals, boozers and out-of-control. According to government ministers and the media, Britain's teenagers are a lost cause, with a brand image that seems beyond repair. A moral panic is in place: if you're under 20, you're trouble. </p> <p>But, when they're not smashing windows or necking alcopops, what do teenagers actually do with their time? This weekend an in-depth survey into the lifestyle of the modern teenager provides a remarkable insight into the everyday lives of wannabe adults. </p> <p>The picture that emerges is somewhat different from the stereotype. It offers a snapshot into the lives of young people with financial aspirations, who are brand savvy, make wide and intelligent use of the internet and spend little on alcohol or cigarettes. </p> <p>The average teenager receives \u00a319.15 in pocket money every week and spends it on fast food, designer clothes, the cinema, concerts and mobile phones. One in seven owns an Ipod and their 10 favourite fashion brands include Armani, Gucci and Prada. </p> <p>The survey was carried out by ukclubculture, an organisation that each year hosts 400 alcohol-free clubbing events nationwide for 800,000 under-18s. It also runs DJ talent competitions for young people in collaboration with Radio One. The company spoke to 1,500 13-to-17-year-olds about exercise, nutrition, fashion, lifestyle and their aspirations. </p> <p>'We want to understand the lives of teens,' said Rachel De Burriatte, brand manager for ukclubcluture. 'There is a tendency to focus on the negative aspect of young people's lives, but these results show they are aspirational and switched on. We need to give them credit for being discerning.' </p> <p>Cheryse Hill, a 16-year-old from Romford, Essex, feels that her generation are often misrepresented. 'You hear so much about teenagers drinking and smoking, but in reality there are loads that do better things than that. I love shopping, going to the cinema and watching DVDs with friends. I love my designer clothes, especially Gucci and Ted Baker.' </p> <p>This week Channel 4 is running a daily programme in which children who have been accused of anti-social behaviour offer their point of view. In tomorrow's episode teenagers say they feel as if society has ganged up on them. A boy called Ben says that he thinks the money spent on surveillance of teenagers would be better spent on giving them more to do, while others say that they feel as if adults have turned against teenagers. </p> <p>The survey reveals that teenagers, whatever their image, have great ambitions. But when it comes to politics, stepping into the shoes of Tony Blair is not one of them. In fact, more than twice as many boys said they would rather be a model than become Prime Minister. Girls were more worthy - opting to become doctors rather than lead their country. </p> <p>The nation's love affair with the mobile phone is strongly in evidence. Girls send, on average, just under 12 text messages a day and the boys, who prefer to make voice calls, nearly 11. The average number of mobile phones per household with teenagers is 3.5, far more than the number of land lines. </p> <p>When it comes to food, one out of five says chocolate is their favourite, followed by fast food and takeaways. Ony two out of 100 put fruit top. Nearly one in 12 say they eat their favourite foods - which include burgers, fish and chips, crisps and chocolate - more than seven times a week. McDonald's tops the brands for both boys and girls, coming out as the favourite in one out of four cases, followed by Cadbury, Pizza Hut, KFC and Coca-Cola. There doesn't seem to be much call for the local organic health food shop. </p> <p>When it comes to computers, 80 per cent of teenagers access the internet from home, with each home having an average of 1.69 computers. Boys are more likely to use their computers to download music and play games, while the girls emerged as more sensible, using it for email and homework. They were all more likely to download music cheaply from the internet than to go out and buy CDs. But while young people are clearly embracing technology, and are much more likey to use it than their parents, there could be some negative consequences to this. </p> <p>'The internet is really important, but it is a digital divide,' said Tom Wilie, chief executive of the National Youth Agency. 'Education has more emphasis on homework and coursework and this could disadvantage those without it. In the past there was a divide where some children had six brothers and sisters so could never work on the kitchen table, and the contemporary version of that could be the internet.' </p> <p>When they were not fighting with siblings over using the computer, the teenagers questioned went out spending their money on clothes, followed by CDs, cinemas and concerts, magazines and mobile phone cards. </p> <p>Wilie said that brands targeted teenagers more and more as customers, so it was not surprising that the survey showed high brand recognition. </p> <p>The boys' favourite label was Nike, followed by FCUK, Adidas and Armani, while the girls liked FCUK the best followed by Top Shop, Nike and Miss Sixty. 'As an adolescent you are rehearsing to be an adult,' he said. 'Children look to adolescents and adolescents look to adults. </p> <p>'There is a design-led culture in adulthood, so that is cascading into adolescence. That is why young teenagers will always want to watch 18-rated films or smoke.' </p> <p>Despite the image of a generation of hard-bitten smokers and boozers, 94 per cent spent questioned had never spent any money on cigarettes and 73 per cent had never bought alcohol. </p> <p>However, 40 per cent admitted to smoking over the past year, and three out of four to drinking. The boys were keener drinkers and 60 per cent supported the idea of opening pubs 24 hours a day. </p> <p>The study comes in a week that youth organisations have hit back at negative media portrayal of young people. </p> <p>A poll by Mori for Young People Now magazine, found that one in three youth-related articles is about crime, with only 8 per cent actually quoting the young people that they refer to. </p> <p>Steve Barrett, editor of Young People Now, said: 'The negative coverage may be because young people don't have the same lobbying power of other groups, don't vote and probably don't consume media as much either, but they do pick up on how they are portrayed and we do not want to disenfranchise the whole sector.' </p> <p>The magazine launched a 'draft media code' for newspapers and broadcasters. Most are not that hopeful that it will work. After-all, teenager as yob fulfils a stereotype. Teenager as Gucci-clad, internet- savvy, young adult does not. </p> <p> How 15-year-old Lawrence Hallows spends his time </p> <p><strong> Sunday </strong> I might go shopping - my favourite brand is Diesel.

  "<p>Spanish explorers called them Las Encantadas, the Enchanted Isles, and Charles Darwin used his studies of the islands as the foundation for his theory of natural selection. The Galapagos are among the world's most important scientific treasures, a group of stark volcanic islands fringed by deserted beaches and inhabited by unique varieties of giant tortoise, lizards and birds. </p> <p>Yet life on this idyllic United Nations world heritage site has turned sour. Pitched battles have broken out between fishermen, armed with machetes, and conservationists. Ecuador, which owns the islands, has sent a naval patrol to quell disturbances, while police last week began arresting local men for rioting and assault. </p> <p>The controversial director of the Galapagos National Park - which controls 97 per cent of Galapagos land and the marine reserve extending to 40 miles offshore - has been sacked, while an air of uneasy tension hangs over the archipelago, as the islanders prepare for next month's election when they pick deputies to represent them in Ecuador's national assembly. </p> <p>'It's a very tense situation,' said Leonor Stjepic, director of the London-based Galapagos Conservation Trust, which raises money to help projects on the islands. 'We are watching it with concern.' </p> <p>The violence has been triggered by an alarming growth in the islands' population. Puerto Ayora, on Santa Cruz island, housed just 45 inhabitants in the Fifties. Today there are more than 10,000, while the islands' total population is more than 19,000 and growing by 6 per cent a year, despite recently introduced laws to limit waves of immigrants fleeing the slums of Ecuador for a life 'in paradise'. On top of this, more than 100,000 tourists visit the islands every year. </p> <p>Such numbers have put the islands' special ecology under intense pressure. Conservationists, backed by the Ecuador government, have replied by imposing strict controls to protect the islands' iguanas, blue-footed boobies and giant tortoises. (Variations in these creatures, on different islands, led Darwin to his great, revolutionary theory.) </p> <p>These moves have infuriated many local people, however. They want to exploit the islands' waters and catch its protected species of sharks, lobsters and sea cucumbers (marine creatures related to sea urchins), which can fetch high prices in Japan and South Korea. </p> <p>Infuriated fishermen laid siege to the Charles Darwin research station on Santa Cruz last February, threatened to kill Lonesome George - the last surviving member of the Pinta Island subspecies of the Galapagos giant tortoise - and blockaded island ports. </p> <p>The dispute was defused after the Ecuador government made concessions by increasing fishing quotas, which angered conservationists. 'It is tragic, the short-term gain of a few fishermen versus the long-term survival of the Galapagos,' said John McCosker of the California Academy of Sciences. 'They are killing the golden goose.' </p> <p>Then, last month, the Ecuador government appointed Fausto Cepeda as the national park's new director, a post that has become a political football for the mainland government. There have been nine directors in the past 18 months. </p> <p>This appointment was particularly controversial, however. Cepeda was known to have close ties with the fishing industry, and the rangers, who run the national park and marine reserve, rebelled. </p> <p>More than 300 staged a sit-in at the park's headquarters, barricaded themselves in and prevented Cepeda from taking up his post. After haranguing his staff, Cepeda departed. Later a group of about 100 fishermen, carrying machetes, saws and cutlasses, stormed the park gate and the rangers' barricades. A pitched battle broke out, and at least two people suffered serious injuries. </p> <p>Eventually, Cepeda - with the fishermen's help - entered the park. 'I am in office. I am in control. And I am trying to lower the tension,' he announced. </p> <p>The Ecuador government took no chances, and sent a patrol boat to maintain the peace. A few days later, Ecuador Environment Minister Fabian Valdivieso met a delegation of rangers. After discussions, he emerged to tell newspapers that he had decided to remove Cepeda from the post. </p> <p>In his place, Valdivieso has given the job to biologist Victor Carrion. A local man, and an experienced biologist, Carrion has the support of the rangers, and may be able to defuse the Galapagos crisis. </p> <p>However, the long-term pressures on the islands, with their continually swelling population, are serious and will not disappear that easily. As the population continues to rise, the pressure on the environment, one of the most important in the world, gets more intense. </p> <p>'We cannot keep the Galapagos in a bubble,' said Stjepic. 'We have to balance its special environment with the needs of local people. In that sense, it is a microcosm for all the other threatened parts of the world. So getting it right here is going to be a very, very important trick to pull off.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Additional research: William Lee</p>",
  "<b> A ... is for asexual</b>. The latest New Scientist says there may be as many people 'glad to be A' (one in 10) as gays, making them part of a new sexual revolution: men and women who announce on A-pride websites and T-shirts that they have no interest in sex. <p><b> B ... is for blood supply</b>. Men have a trickier time than most other male mammals because they lack a bone to shore up their most strenuous moments and rely instead on blood pressure. Hence the rise of the Viagra generation: the number of men seeking boosts for their penile blood supply has tripled in three years. </p> <p><b> C ... is for cross-dressing</b>. Big out east, apparently. Nearly a half of Croatians and Slovakians like to cross-dress for sex. Only a third of Brits have ever bothered. </p> <p><b>D ... is for dogging</b>. The new UK exhibitionist pastime which has seen a 60 per cent increase in couples having sex in front of strangers, usually in parked cars at semi-secluded beauty spots, after announcing their plans on websites. Famous practitioners include the former footballer Stan Collymore. </p> <p><b> E ... is for education</b>. Children in Britain are 12-years-old on average when they attend their first formal sex education classes. In Germany, the young begin a year earlier, but in Vietnam they don't get going until they are 15. This may explain the tardiness of the Vietnamese at having their first sexual experiences. (See V for virginity.) </p> <p><b> F ... is for foreplay</b>. Described as the petting before the getting, foreplay varies enormously between nations. In Thailand lovers scarcely bother, and spend a mere 11.5 minutes on it. Unbelievably, Britain comes top with 22.5. Presumably few Scotsmen took part in the survey. </p> <p><b> G ... is for G-spot</b>. Desmond Morris recently revealed that women have four super-sensitive orgasm zones. Most men didn't know their partners had one. </p> <p><b> H ... is for health</b>. In Britain, 48 per cent of lovers have unprotected sex without knowing their partner's sexual history, it was revealed last week. Danes and Swedes are even bigger risk-takers when it comes to sexual health (64 per cent), while people from India (20 per cent), Vietnam (24) and Spain (26) are the most cautious. </p> <p><b> I ... is for illegal</b>. The Sexual Offences Act, introduced this year, has legalised a range of homosexual acts previously banned by Victorian legislation, but has introduced tough new measures for dealing with rape and child sex abuse. </p> <p><b> J ... is for Joy of Sex</b>. Written by Dr Alex Comfort and published in 1972, the graphically illustrated Joy of Sex was the first significant 'how-to' guide to sexual technique. The book was a huge bestseller but, inadvertently, it introduced the idea of sexual inadequacy. The guide was updated two years ago. </p> <p><b> K ... is for kissing</b>. After two and half years of watching couples smooching in airports, on park benches and in railway stations, Onur Gunturkun of Ruhr University in Germany, not only avoided arrest but managed to conclude that two thirds of humans tilt their heads to the right when they kiss. </p> <p><b> L ... is for 'love that dare not speak its name'</b>. This was Oscar Wilde's description of homosexuality. According to a recent analysis of the last census figures, only 78,522 individuals identified themselves as living in gay or lesbian relationships in England and Wales. Most experts believe the real statistic is much higher, suggesting gay people are still reluctant to admit their status. </p> <p><b> M ... is for masturbation</b>. Favoured least - according to a survey in lads' mag FHM - as a source of sexual pleasure in the north of England, which is bottom of the nation's masturbation league. On the other hand, infidelity rates are highest there, suggesting a possible connection. </p> <p><b> N ... is for numbers of partners</b>. People around the world have had an average of 10.5 sexual partners, according to last week's survey. In China, the figure is an impressive 19.3; in Vietnam, a mere 2.5. In Britain, we manage 10.3. </p> <p><b> O ... is for orgasm</b>. Worldwide 45 per cent of men - but only 17 per cent of women - have an orgasm each time they have sex, though these figures rise with age and experience. Italians are the most likely to reach a climax (a 61 per cent average for both sexes) compared with a miserable 19 per cent for the Chinese. Britain comes in at 35 per cent, but lucky Poland scores 45 per cent. </p> <p><b> P ... is for promiscuous</b>. Research published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health last week revealed that 10 per cent of Britons were now classed as being officially promiscuous. Their multiple partners, precocious sexual behaviour and use of prostitutes are pushing the country into a sexual health crisis, the journal claimed. </p> <p><b>R ... is for Rohypnol</b>. Only 15 cases have been successfully prosecuted in the UK in the past five years concerning such date rape drugs as rohypnol. Now police forces are to launch a six-month survey of the crime across seven forces to try to determine the prevalence of its use. </p> <p><b> S ... is for sperm</b>. During his life, the average man makes two thousand billion of these tiny biological packages. However, for the typical Western man fewer than two carry out their function of impregnating a woman. These fertility rates are continuing to drop, population experts revealed this month. </p> <p><b> T... is for toys</b>. Sex toys are favoured by Norwegians, Icelanders and Brits. Around a half of all people in these countries report using vibrators and other sex toys. In Thailand and Vietnam, only 5 per cent bother. </p> <p><b>U ... is for uxorobalent</b>. A condition in which a man is only able to achieve sexual fulfilment when he has intercourse with his wife. Not be to be confused with being uxoravalent, when a man is only able to attain sexual fulfilment extramaritally. </p> <p><b> V ... is for virginity</b>. The average age for losing this is now 17.7. For the previous generation, made up of people now over 45, it was 18.2 years. Nations differ greatly, however. In Iceland they lose it by 15.7, while in Vietnam they hang on for 19.8 years. The UK figure is 16.7. </p> <p><b> W ... is for watching</b>. A major turn-on in South Africa, where 60 per cent of couples watch pornographic movies together at some point during their relationship. In Britain, the figure is 50 per cent, while in China it drops to 24 per cent - a reflection, possibly, of the state of Chinese pornography. (See also D for dogging.) </p> <p><b> X ... is for X-chromosome</b>. Italian scientists last week revealed a study suggesting a piece of DNA on the X-chromosome, linked to high fertility in women, may predispose men to be homosexual. </p> <p> <b> Y ... is for Y-chromosome</b>. This tiny packet of DNA confers masculinity to its owners but is disappearing at an alarming rate. According to Dr Jenny Graves, of the Australian National University, it started 300 million years ago with 1,438 genes, but has now lost 1,393 of them. In 10 million years, it could disappear. </p> <p> <b> Z ... is for Zoophiles</b>. Men and women who have sex with animals. Goats are, for some reason, a favourite, as exemplified by the recent case of Stephen Hall, from Hull, who was jailed for six months after being caught in a compromising position with a goat in front of a trainload of commuters.

  "Unionists claimed last night that the British government's decision to give an extra \u00a3450,000 of taxpayers' money to a west Belfast-based private newspaper group was linked to talks between Sinn Fein and senior Downing Street negotiators. <p>They have called for a parliamentary inquiry into why the Blair government handed over more cash to the Andersonstown News Group, alleging that the move was sanctioned at the highest levels. </p> <p>The deal, which has been secret until now, also faces a legal challenge from the news group's main rivals, the Belfast daily Irish News . </p> <p>Lord Laird of Artigarvan said any inquiry should focus on who gave the go-ahead for the major cash injection as well as explore any political motive for the funding. </p> <p>The additional money is on top of an undisclosed sum given to the Andersonstown News Group, which aims to set up a daily newspaper to rival the Irish News . </p> <p>It is understood that senior executives at the Irish News lodged legal papers last week to challenge the British government's willingness to help fund a rival .The Irish News is exploring the possibility that the donations may be illegal under European laws established to prevent state interference and influence on privately owned, independent newspapers. </p> <p>The latest cash allocation is disclosed in a letter from Northern Ireland Office Minister Barry Gardiner to Laird dated 23 September, 2004. </p> <p>In response to a parliamentary question, he lays out details of the grant to the Andersonstown News, which has strong links to Sinn Fein. He reveals that \u00a337,065 was allocated to cover the group's 'Company Development Programme', \u00a392,248 for an 'Interest rate subsidy on approval lending for business expansion', and a further \u00a354,400 for the 'Production of Arts Supplement for L\u00e1' - the Irish-language daily. </p> <p>'I will be asking my Ulster Unionist colleagues and other MPs in the Commons to raise this issue in the Northern Ireland Select Committee,' Laird said last night. 'There ought to be an inquiry into why this money was handed over. </p> <p>'It is certainly immoral and unfair, most of all to the Irish News, and may even be illegal under European law.' </p> <p>Sources at Stormont told The Observer that Northern Ireland Secretary Paul Murphy is uneasy about the decision to continue funding the group. They said the go-ahead for the finance package 'went all the way to Number 10'.</p>",
  "<p>The phrases would be more at home on the pages of a dark detective novel, full of wincing insights into the world of gangsterism, corruption and physical violence. </p> <p>'Cut me in or you'll regret it.' 'The man was stripped to his underpants, tied to a chair with his own silk tie and threatened with a shotgun.' 'Give us half of that man or you're dead.' </p> <p>But these are not phrases to do with lurid tales from the underworld; these are stories from the Premiership. </p> <p>There have been plenty more to add to the lexicon this week, after the collapse of a court case that revealed the glamorous, multi-millionaire world of football's top league to be a seedy, sleazy, unregulated cesspit of financial mismanagement and rank thuggery. </p> <p>It was a tale of gangsters, blackmailers, a young British footballer already approaching legendary status, a surveillance expert, London's most notorious gangster family, and a crooked solicitor. John Hyland and brothers Christopher and Anthony Bacon were charged with demanding money with menaces from Paul Stretford, agent to British football's hottest property, Wayne Rooney. </p> <p>But the charges against all three men were dropped and not guilty verdicts entered by the court when a document subpoenaed from Proactive indicated that the prosecution were unable to rely on Stretford as a credible witness. Although Stretford broke down in tears during the case and said he had developed an 'arthritic nature in my foot caused by the stress', the founder of Proactive, one of the top three sports agencies in Britain who broker deals between clubs and their famous players, is not averse to using his own means of closing a deal. </p> <p>'If you looked up the definition of a dodgy agent in the dictionary then there would probably be a picture of Paul Stretford,' says one Premiership football agent who spoke to The Observer . </p> <p>When Rooney made his debut for Manchester United a fortnight ago - scoring a hat-trick against Fenerbahce SK in the Champions League before a packed house at Old Trafford - it immediately provided vindication of his \u00a327m fee for the United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, and the club's chief executive and purse holder, David Gill. But beyond the transfer and the fans' adulation for the young striker from Everton are revelations that highlight just how badly football needs regulating. </p> <p>'Stretford was a down-at-heel businessman who had no real knowledge of the football world who became friends with players and ended up being in very powerful position because he got into the industry quite early,' says the agent. </p> <p>Hyland, an associate of Rooney's first agent, Peter McIntosh, had been negotiating with 42-year-old Stretford for more than a year to get Rooney. </p> <p>The court was told a remarkable story of hard men battling for big money. The prosecution case centred on a meeting in a Cheshire hotel in June 2003, with Dave Lockwood, the business partner of McIntosh. Stretford, who had secretly set up a video camera, was talking with Lockwood when Hyland, another business associate of McIntosh, and the Bacon brothers burst into the room. </p> <p>'I'm the muscle,' said Christopher Bacon, while Hyland banged his fist on the table and demanded that Stretford sign an agreement that would give him half of all the agent's earnings from Rooney. </p> <p>Stretford, a former vacuum salesman, was desperate to control Rooney. The \u00a31.5 million he received for the player's move to Old Trafford and the \u00a3500,000 Rooney also paid him shows how high the rewards can be. The fact that Stretford withdrew \u00a3250,000 in cash to pay off Hyland illustrates how murky football deals can be. </p> <p>The court was told that the money never changed hands. But William Linfield, a surveillance expert and former soldier, told police that Stretford had left him in his black Mercedes with the money stuffed in a bag ready to produce it. Again, the case sounded like a detective novel. </p> <p>Whatever the precise details, the case has brought into the open the secrets of how some of football's deals are done. </p> <p>Jake Duncan has been a players' agent since 1995 and is also tour manager of the pop group, Westlife. 'The problem is that no agents or tabloid press are prepared to stick their heads over the parapet and speak out,' he said. 'I could graffiti Alex Ferguson's house tomorrow but if, the very next day, I happen to represent the player who could all but guarantee his club's entry into the last four of the Champions League, then they would send a helicopter for me. No question.' </p> <p>With Rooney all the parties involved knew they had such a player. The court case heard that at an earlier meeting in November 2002, the former Liverpool and Scotland footballer, Kenny Dalglish, invited Tommy Adams - described in court as a 'notorious gangster' - to a rendezvous at a Heathrow hotel. </p> <p>It was alleged that Dalglish, a major shareholder in Proactive which represented Rooney and a long-standing friend of Stretford, wanted Adams, head of London's top criminal family who had served seven years for importing cannabis, to provide protection for Stretford at the meeting with Hyland and McIntosh. </p> <p>Stretford claimed in evidence that he felt intimidated at seeing a 'London villain' present and the meeting became heated when Hyland and the others could not get Stretford to sign a deal on their terms. Dalglish and Adams apparently said little but Dalglish, a former Footballer of the Year, then refused to give police a statement. </p> <p>In court, Stretford said he felt let down by Dalglish. 'I have a had a great and long relationship with Kenny Dalglish and yes, I felt let down by him.' </p> <p>Stretford himself was accused of wanting Adams present. 'You knew full well that Kenny Dalglish had engineered for one of his unsavoury friends to come and facilitate this meeting,' Lord Carlile, Hylands' barrister said in court. 'It was you who brought the heavy mob, wasn't it?' Stretford denied this and said it was 'fear and confusion' that prevented him from leaving the meeting. </p> <p>Dalglish was also accused of influencing Rooney's switch from McIntosh to Stretford, visiting Rooney's home to convince his parents, Wayne snr and Jeanette, that their son should change representatives. </p> <p>The Rooneys were already in slightly warm water, the court heard. They had sought legal advice from a crooked solicitor, Kevin Dooley, brother-in-law of former Liverpool manager Roy Evans and a friend of Dalglish who was recommended to them by Stretford. Dooley was later struck off for defrauding clients before his death this year. 'We decided Wayne would be better off in their [Proactive's] hands. They seemed more professional,' said Wayne snr. </p> <p>Rooney's move to United had been precipitated by apparent interest from Newcastle United who, despite the presence at the club already of four top-class strikers, including former England captain, Alan Shearer, tabled a \u00a320 million transfer bid. </p> <p>In court, Carlile asked Stretford about this, wondering if the bid was genuine or a ruse to inflate Rooney's eventual price and draw Manchester United into an early deal. 'I don't think anyone makes a bid of \u00a320m to another club if they don't mean it,' said Stretford. 'We were very prepared for the Newcastle bid to be accepted and for Wayne to negotiate with Newcastle United.' </p> <p>Others, again, beg to differ. 'Rooney was never going to sign for Newcastle,' says the agent who spoke to The Observer . 'I think Freddy Shepherd [Newcastle's chairman] was used by Stretford. He won't think he's been used but that is what has happened.' </p> <p>What, then, can be done to clean up the mess? 'There is no indication that any regulations have been broken in this case,' a spokesman for the Football Association rather mysteriously said in the immediate aftermath of Monday's case collapse. </p> <p>On Thursday, Stretford stepped down as director of the Formation Group which owns Proactive, for 'personal reasons'. He remains head of their player representation division.</p>",

  "The United States of America is about to reach a fork in the road, but it seems the country has not yet decided which direction to take. There is little time left for debate, nor is more needed. The American election has been in full swing all year. The deliberately truncated nature of the Democratic primaries ensured John Kerry and President George W Bush would face-off against each other from early March. It has been a long, hard-fought campaign. The war in Iraq has ensured passions on both sides would always run deep. As a result, Americans have had ample opportunity to measure Republicans and Democrats against each other. Arguments have been thrashed out, the points have been made, policies compared and contrasted. The debates have greatly helped this process. <p>Kerry has emerged from them with a renewed vigour that had once seemed to be ebbing in the face of attacks on his war record in August. Now a fuller portrait of the man has emerged. It is a picture in which there is much to admire. From behind the Republican rhetoric of a wooden elitist who chopped and changed with the political winds, Kerry has come over as surprisingly warm. His joke in the final debate that he had 'married up' with his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, showed a refreshing ability not to take himself too seriously. </p> <p>At the same time, Kerry has made his arguments forcefully and, unlike Bush, without too much TV-unfriendly anger. Yes, he has performed acrobatics over Iraq, but on a host of other issues, he has emerged as a man of principle seeking to engage America in the wider world. It has been a reasoned appeal to a more complex world view than the unilateralist Republicans have offered. What right-wingers have lambasted as 'flip-flopping' is, in fact, often nuance. And, in a world of increasing extremism, nuance is no bad thing. As Kerry said in the Arizona debate: 'Like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America.' </p> <p>And Kerry's ideas look good not just for America but for the rest of us. Take the environment. Bush shuns the Kyoto pact on reducing emissions. Kerry also will not sign it. But he has said he favours re-opening negotiations about it. Take taxes. Bush favours making his tax cuts, which heavily favour the wealthy, permanent despite America's huge deficit. Kerry favours taking away only the cuts for those earning more than $200,000 a year. This is not Kerry as radical tax-and-spend liberal as Bush charges - this is simply reasonable. </p> <p>Take embryonic stem cell research. Bush opposes it from a position rooted in personal religious beliefs; Kerry favours allowing America's scientists to press on, perhaps to the eventual benefit of mankind. Take abortion, an issue that resonates across the world. Bush is against it. His decision is deeply influenced by his brand of born-again Christian faith and reflects the religious right in America. It has seen Bush pass legislation banning 'partial birth abortion'. </p> <p>Many Democrats believe a second Bush term will see a much wider attack. Kerry is also against abortion. He says that, as a Catholic, he cannot accept it. But, more importantly, Kerry believes his faith should never be imposed on others; he is firmly pro-choice in politics. This is heartening. America was created with a constitution that strictly separates church and state, an inspiration and model to many nations. Bush has blurred some of the edges; Kerry will maintain this vital divide. </p> <p>Take the United Nations. Many Republicans openly scorn Kerry's comments on a 'global test' for intervention. That is ridiculous. If America were directly threatened, Kerry has said he would react pre-emptively, just as Bush would. Kerry's comments were merely about wanting to persuade the world to follow America's lead, not seeking to bully it. Kerry wants to reconnect America with the wider community of nations. </p> <p>Finally, there is Iraq. Here, there is little difference between the two candidates. Whatever their thoughts on the rights and wrongs of the invasion, both candidates are committed to staying the course. That is probably the only reasonable option. </p> <p>So, with 17 days to go until voting, America is fast approaching that fork in the road. For both Americans and the rest of us, the path John Kerry would take seems brighter.</p>",
  "The Turner Prize is unfailingly controversial. Each year the finalists in the Tate Gallery's leading contemporary art prize are attacked for setting out to shock their audience, rather than to make art. One year Chris Ofili's elephant dung was in the doghouse; the next, Tracey Emin's dirty, unmade bed upset visitors. Two years later conventional art lovers were affronted by Martin Creed's simple and ultimately award-winning room featuring only a light switch. <p>But the controversy now breaking around one of the nominated works of art this year cannot be dismissed as a clever gimmick. At the last minute, the centrepiece of a challenging display put together by Turner finalists Langlands &amp; Bell has been withdrawn from the competition because it has fallen foul of the law. The unexpected decision, taken by the artists on the advice of the Tate Gallery lawyers, will leave a big hole in the prestigious annual exhibition of the shortlisted artists, which was due to open its doors to the public on Tuesday. </p> <p>The Tate became aware of the legal problem at the end of last week, just as the show was being put up. With regret the artists were told, in an unprecedented development, that the artwork would have to be withdrawn immediately if the gallery was to avoid the possibility of prosecution. </p> <p>The legal issue revolves around a 12-minute film made by the artistic duo of Ben Langlands and Nikki Bell while they were in Kabul in 2002. The artists had been commissioned to go to Afghanistan by the Imperial War Museum to create art that responded to the situation in the country following the toppling of the Taliban regime. </p> <p>The film they shot there depicted the trial of a man in the supreme court of the Afghan capital. 'We just went into the court and sat down in one of the rows with our video camera,' said Ben Langlands yesterday. The resulting trial footage was to have dominated their exhibit in the Tate and to have provided the context for their other pieces, including a photographic work which uses the acronyms, icons and symbols of all the different aid agencies working in Afghanistan at the time and a virtual reality tour of the home of Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>Now, due to the start of the Old Bailey trial of another man, Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, who is charged with 'conspiracy to torture' and 'conspiracy to take hostages', the Langlands &amp; Bell film has been judged potentially prejudicial to the new proceedings. </p> <p>'We can't pretend we didn't make this film. The film exists,' said Nikki Bell. 'But for the sake of the witnesses we will go along with the advice we have been given.' </p> <p>At the start of the Zardad trial the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, told the court that the defendant, who has lived in south London for several years and worked, among other things, as a pizza chef, is accused of overseeing the torture, imprisonment and murder of innocent people. His case represents a legal landmark in its own right since it is the first time a British criminal court has tried alleged crimes which were committed abroad, especially as neither the defendant nor the alleged victims were British. Lord Goldsmith explained to the court that 'there are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country'. Zardad denies the charges against him and is defended by Cherie Booth's legal chambers, Matrix Law.</p> <p>The two artists affected by the decision are now planning to ask the Tate if they can project a legal notice to explain the missing film. The notice would fill the gallery wall on which their film was originally to have been shown. Langlands &amp; Bell, who have been working together for a decade, are best known for architectural work and pieces using models. </p> <p>The extraordinary withdrawal of the film is, in fact, strangely in keeping with the mood of the Turner Prize show that opens to the public this week. Three of the nominated artists, Jeremy Deller, Yinka Shonibare and Langlands &amp; Bell, have all chosen work with a serious theme and a relevance to world politics. </p> <p>Jeremy Deller has made a film about George Bush and Texas, while Yinka Shonibare has recreated the assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden in 1792 in order to draw parallels with modern political fears. </p> <p>And while Kutlug Ataman, the final shortlisted artist, has not created a work which deals directly with politics, he has revealed that he was the victim of torture during his youth in Turkey. As a young man in 1980 he filmed a protest march and was arrested by the police and held in captivity for 38 days, on 28 of which he says he was tortured. </p> <p>No one would have predicted it, but it seems the Turner Prize is unremittingly grown-up this year. For once it will be hard for critics to dismiss it as a mere sideshow.</p> <p><b>From pickled beasts to provocative pottery</b></p> <p><b>Damien Hirst: </b> the most notorious Turner Prize row was kicked off in 1995 by the Sun, which raged at Hirst for making art out of dead animals preserved in formaldehyde. </p> <p><b> Chris Ofili:</b> in 1998 this stylish artist was the butt of jokes when he used elephant dung on his decorative canvases. </p> <p><b>Martin Creed:</b> Three years ago Creed was derided for making art out of a light in a room that simply went on and off. </p> <p><b>Grayson Perry:</b> Last year the blue-frocked transvestite won with his disturbing pottery, which deals with child abuse and terrorism.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Elliott Smith</strong> <br> <strong> From a Basement on the Hill</strong> <br>(Domino) </p> <p>Elliott Smith began recording solo in the early Nineties while playing with the Portland, Oregon-based hardcore band Heatmiser. The first two homespun records were mostly voice and acoustic guitar, softly sung and intimate, blending Nick Drake with Big Star's more introspective moments. In 1997 he won an Oscar nomination for his contribution to Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting . Pipped, inexplicably, to the post by Mariah Carey, Smith none the less performed during the ceremonies to a television audience of 200 million. His fame should have been assured. However, while subsequent major label releases were met with slavering critical acclaim, they never brought him the commercial recognition he deserved. That he has influenced artists of today is apparent - our own Badly Drawn Boy owes him a lot. But perhaps his mellifluous melancholy was always just a tad too left-field, a bit too intense, for mainstream tastes. </p> <p>And now this, released almost exactly a year after Smith stabbed himself twice through the heart and died at his Echo Park, Los Angeles home. A troubled childhood of alleged abuse followed by years of depression, alcohol and drug addiction had seemingly caught up with a prodigious musical talent. After years of rehab, clean from dependency at the time of his death at 34, Smith reportedly intended his sixth studio album to be a collection of 30 tracks completed during the last months of his life alternating sweet pop with more difficult material harking back to his hardcore days. What we have here, on the other hand, is a collection put together by his family which, it is said, omits the more difficult, discordant work from the sessions. </p> <p>Whether the release reflects Smith's intentions is impossible to ascertain; but it feels as though a broader sweep of the completed tracks would have been appreciated by his loyal fanbase. From a Basement... chimes with Smith's later work and, although for the uninitiated this may not be the best place to discover him (1995's Either/Or and 2000's XO are better starting points), it is often sublime, compelling and at times thoroughly beautiful. </p> <p>Opening with the uplifting crash and wallop of the indie rock 'Coast to Coast' and on to the gentle acoustic refrains of 'Let's Get Lost', where Smith intones that he'd like to 'Burn every bridge that I cross, find some beautiful place to get lost', the palette of moods is a delight - even if his ambiguous lyrics are never far from bleak. The prophetic 'A Fond Farewell' reads like a suicide note to himself. 'Shooting Star', with the guitar crescendo of its intro, sounds very much like classic Big Star; 'Memory Lane', with its plaintive blues folk lines, harks back to Smith's formative sound, and is a joy. In among all this quality, standout tracks 'Kings Crossing', which boasts a prime Bowie-esque chorus, and 'Twilight', all heartbreak and romantic yearning, truly shine. </p> <p>And yet, good as it is, From a Basement... lacks the orchestrated cohesion and brilliance of XO and Figure 8 ; those two records showcased Smith's aptitude for production and arrangement. Perhaps the album was cathartic, featuring as it does so many of his different styles and musical shades; maybe he intended to move on from his happy-sad sound. </p> <p>That Elliott Smith was not as well known as he should have been is a crying shame; no doubt the fascination surrounding his death will increase his popularity, and that, if nothing else, is a good thing. The first time I heard his exact guitar picking and gentle voice I was hooked; the sophistication and pop sensibility of his songs left me fuzzy-warm. It might just do the same for you. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To order From a Basement on a Hill for \u00a313.99 with free UK p&amp;p, call the Observer Music Service on 0870 836 0713</p>",
  "<p><strong>Martin Carthy with Peggy Seeger &amp; Guests</strong><br>Purcell Room, London SE1</p> <p>Peggy Seeger sits down, closes her eyes and sings, high and reedy, the ballad of 'Georgie', or 'Geordie', in which a young woman pleads for her lover's life - to no avail, of course: this is folk music (tales of love, war and cruel death that will resonate with unusual force this evening). </p> <p>Songmaker, eco-feminist, half-sister of Pete; the woman who smote Ewan MacColl at first sight - Seeger, you feel, spends a lot of time resonating. Now 69, living with her second partner, Irene, she puts on a rare masterclass here, flitting between funny and angry, banjo, guitar, Steinway and autoharp - on old age, Bush ('he's a bad man, a mad man ... a chosen-by-chad man') and bombs; deploying her own payload in a song about her four abortions. Her hour up, she thanks us for our attention. </p> <p>More riveting still are father-and-daughter act Martin Carthy and Eliza Carthy (sadly mum Norma Waterson was absent) - Eliza, the double-stopping fiddler and heart-stopping vocalist; Carthy senior's picked guitar thinking out loud beneath roundly enunciated lyrics that suck you in, on 'The Bows of London' and 'Bill Norrie', which climaxes in a beheading.

  "<p>Deepest west London: a crowd watches a young girl wearing a flimsy polka dot dress skate round in a circle in the middle of an ice rink. The music she moves to is a classical cover version of 'Eye of the Tiger'. Her legs are split a full 180 degrees and as she turns she flashes her virginally white knickers to hyped-up photographers and an enthusiastic crowd who whoop and cheer at the spectacle. When the laws of gravity eventually force her movement to come to an end she skates to the edge of the rink. With hands on hips she stops to give a cheeky little pose to the cameras. The music switches to Rossini's overture from William Tell and as the next model enters the rink the first girl skates sassily away. </p> <p>Welcome to the circus that is Fashion Week, the London spring/summer 2005 collection to be precise. For four days the capital is taken over by fashion tribes that converge from all over the world to watch a series of designers compete for column inches and high product sales by putting on a collection of, hopefully, spectacular shows. The stakes for even the most famous designers are high. They have less than 20 minutes to make a lasting impression on press and buyers. Increasingly, the tool designers are using to create that wow factor is music. </p> <p>It doesn't take more than a quick glance at the front rows of the shows or at a music video on MTV to notice the link between music and fashion. Puffy, OutKast's Andre 3000 and Kylie are just a few of the musicians who boost their already fat incomes by dabbling in fashion. But how does the music that accompanies the catwalk shows come about? Until the 1950s catwalk shows were silent apart from the titles of the dresses being announced. Fast forward to the 21st century and the high-octane white label tracks that can be heard at many of the shows are often played on the catwalk before they make it into clubs. The music works like a soundtrack to a film and sets the mood for the show. It helps if the models find it easy to walk with the music, but sometimes they are not even walking... </p> <p>Queensway ice rink is the not-so-fashionable setting for the Peter Jensen show in west London. The music pursues the theme of the show - it's a tribute to skating anti-heroine Tonya Harding. Two girls in lemon sorbet-coloured raincoats swish by like a pair of Forties movie starlets in an epic musical. The too-cool-for-school fashionistas let themselves get caught up in the emotion of the performance, screaming with delight at the breathtaking moves and oohing and ahhing at the outfits. </p> <p>From cheesy classical covers of pop and rock tracks such as 'Reach Out and I'll Be There' to 'The Waltz' from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty , a musical backdrop is created that is not just evocative of a mood but so self-referential that nothing can be taken too seriously. Both Jensen and Fabio Almeida, the DJ who produced the music, delight in taking a humorous approach and in fashion any irreverence makes for a welcome breath of fresh air. Apparently, the production of the soundtrack is always last minute. 'It takes a few mixes to get the final product,' says Almeida. 'I have one evening where I sit down at my computer and see what works and what doesn't and then it's just a matter of presenting it to the designer.' </p> <p>The Temperley show is held in the opulent setting of the Porchester Hall. The venue's art deco ceilings bedecked with crystal chandeliers add to the high fashion feel of the show. Alice Temperley's designs consist of delicately feminine dresses favoured by Hollywood A-listers including Gwyneth Paltrow, Kirsten Dunst and Scarlett Johansson. It's hardly cutting-edge. But when the lights are dimmed and the music starts, the atmosphere completely changes. Alec Wek and model of the moment Lilli strut down the runway to a chunky house bassline. When Jacquetta Wheeler sashays long-leggedly to the tango rhythms of Sarah Vaughan's 'Whatever Lola Wants' mixed into the Gotan Project's version, the effect is so sensual it's almost obscene. </p> <p>'The theme of the music was anything to do with alluring and dangerous women,' says Theo Green, who produced the music for the show. 'There's a big tango theme running through the soundtrack because that style of music brings out that sexy but dangerous side in women.' Green's background is in film so music and dialogue from movies such as The Wicker Man, The Ninth Gate and Las Vampiras that hint at the theme were layered on top of the other tracks. 'Some of the tracks may not instantly strike you as the most obvious music to walk to but I think it's good to break it up.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, backstage at the Boyd show there is a maelstrom of half-clothed models and agents. In a corner quaffing a mini-bottle of Mo\u00ebt is Dannii Minogue. 'The soundtracks to the shows are so important,' she enthuses. 'Can you imagine watching the shows without music?' </p> <p>Former Human League member Adrian Wright is Tracey Boyd's partner, and he certainly can't. 'Every season I buy millions of records and every few months I play them to Tracey, who makes a shortlist of the tracks that she thinks would work,' he says. 'We don't bother about whether the girls are going to find them easy to walk to as good models can walk to anything.' </p> <p>The models for east London-based designers PPQ are the Cazals, a four-piece rock group signed to 1234 records, whose roster includes bands such as Pete Doherty's Babyshambles and Whitey. The record label and PPQ share the same building, and it's this interface between music and fashion that provides the starting point for the two designers behind PPQ, Percy Parker and Amy Molyneux. </p> <p>'I was inspired for the show by the music that's coming through on the label,' says Molyneux. 'It's a really good feeling because I can sense what's current and what people want and how they want to look.' </p> <p>The pair chose to work with the Cazals because they're a gorgeous bunch of lads who ooze stage presence. And while the band say they're not that bothered about fashion, Phil Bush, the lead singer, admits that many people call him a dandy. 'I used to be a Soho dandy mod when I was younger so I guess my approach to fashion is influenced by that.' Yet he struggles to find a contemporary youth culture that merges music and fashion in the same way that the mod scene used to. 'A look goes with a sound that makes the youth culture. That's what used to define youth culture; people dressing differently to identify them as belonging to a specific group. But youth cultures like that don't exist in Britain anymore.' </p> <p>To find the last time British fashion and music united to make a statement, you might need to go back as far as 1974 when Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood opened their shop, Sex. 'Fashion and music were the expressions of the same needs,' says McLaren, who regularly attends the shows. 'In retrospect it seems natural that a shop producing a street fashion of boredom should be the venue for its music: punk rock. </p> <p>'But both industries began to control the artists,' he continues, 'and in turn those artists became more like product managers. The rules were set and if you attempted to change them you would no longer be wanted on location.' </p> <p>Hedi Slimane, designer for Dior Homme and the hottest name in fashion at the moment, doesn't quite see it that way. 'I always connected with music,' he says when I catch up with him during Paris Fashion Week. 'I had my first David Bowie album when I was six years old!' </p> <p>Slimane has dressed a lot of rock stars and bands, including his current favourites the Libertines. But when it comes to the music for his shows, he asks particular musicians to compose a soundtrack for him. 'Beck composed the music for my show in Los Angeles in July while he was recording his album. I could do what others usually do and use a DJ and a mix, but I never liked the idea that the music wouldn't be a creation of its own. The show becomes a collective enterprise.' </p> <p>If the fashionistas are thrilled by such a process, what of the musicians? One would imagine that walking down a catwalk in designer clothes to the soundtrack of your own band's music would feel pretty cool but Martin, the Cazals' guitarist, isn't so impressed. 'We've done shows in Paris and Tokyo and worked with famous designers but I find fashion boring,' he moans. 'At the end of the day they're only clothes.'</p>",
  "<p>I was born in St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on the first of November, 1962. My mom wanted to name me after my dad, which would have made me John Kiedis III, but my dad was leaning toward Clark Gable Kiedis or Courage Kiedis. In the end, they settled on Anthony Kiedis, which was an homage to my great-grandfather. But from the start, I was known as Tony. </p> <p>When I was three, we moved to California and I have vague recollections of the first apartment that the three of us shared, but in under a year, my parents had split up. My dad's budding career as a film director got derailed in 1966, when he ran into a cute young roller-skating carhop who introduced him to pot. </p> <p>When I was about four, my dad and I were on one of our outings, walking down Sunset Strip, when he suddenly stopped and gently blew some pot smoke into my face. We walked a few more blocks, and I was getting more and more excited. Then I stopped and asked: 'Dad, am I dreaming?' </p> <p>'No, you're awake,' he said. </p> <p>'Okay.' I shrugged and proceeded to scamper up a traffic light like a little monkey, feeling slightly altered. </p> <p>Once my dad got into pot, he started hanging out at the music clubs that were part of the new scene on Sunset Strip. Correspondingly, we saw less and less of him. Each summer my mom and I returned to Grand Rapids to see our relatives. Grandma Molly and her husband, Ted, would take me to Grand Haven Beach, and we'd have a great time. During that stay in the summer of 1967, my mom met a new man at Grand Haven. After they spent some time together, he talked her into returning to Michigan with him, in December 1967. </p> <p>Every so often, my dad would make an unscheduled visit to Michigan. He'd show up with a lot of heavy suitcases, which he stored in the basement. I realised from trips to California that he was involved in moving huge truckloads of marijuana, but it never registered that when he came to visit, that was what he was up to. I was just euphoric that he was there. And he couldn't have been more different from every other person in the state. Everyone on my block, everyone I'd ever come into contact with in Michigan, wore short hair and short-sleeved button-down shirts. My dad would show up in six-inch silver platform snakeskin shoes with rainbows on them, bell-bottom jeans with crazy velvet patchwork all over them, giant belts covered in turquoise, skintight, almost midriff T-shirts with some great emblem on them, and tight little velvet rocker jackets from London. His slightly receding hair was down to his waist, and he had a bushy handlebar mustache and huge sideburns. </p> <p>My mom didn't exactly embrace my dad as a good friend, but she recognised how important he was to me, so she was always pleasant and facilitated our communication. He would stay in my room, and when he left, she would sit down with me, and I would write him thank-you notes for whatever presents he'd bought me, and tell him how much fun it was to see him. </p> <p>By the age of 10, in the fifth grade, I had also begun to show some entrepreneurial talent. I would organise the neighbourhood kids, and we'd put on shows in my basement. I'd pick out a record, usually by the Partridge Family, and we'd all act out the songs using makeshift instruments like brooms and upside-down laundry tubs. I was always Keith Partridge, and we'd lip-sync and dance around and entertain the other kids who weren't quite capable of partaking in the performance. </p> <p>I was always looking to make a buck or two, so one time when we had the use of a friend's basement, I decided I would charge whatever these kids could come up with - a dime, a nickel, a quarter - to come down there to attend a Partridge Family concert. I set up a big curtain and put a stereo behind it. Then I addressed the crowd: 'The Partridge Family are basically shy, and besides, they're much too famous to be in Grand Rapids, so they're going to play a song for you from behind this curtain.' </p> <p>In sixth grade, I started coming home for lunch, and my friends would congregate there. We'd play spin the bottle, and even though we had our own girlfriends, swapping was never a problem. Mostly we just French-kissed; sometimes we'd designate the time that the kiss had to last. I tried to get my girlfriend to take off her bra and let me feel her up, but she wouldn't give in. Somewhere late in the sixth grade, I decided that it was time to go live with my dad. My mom was at her wits' end with me. </p> <p>When i left michigan aged 12 in 1974 I told all my friends I was moving to California to be a movie star. But as soon as I started driving around with my dad, singing along to the pop songs on the radio (which I wasn't particularly good at), I announced: 'I'm going to be a singer. That's really what I'm going to do.' </p> <p>I had been there only a few days when my dad called me into the kitchen. He was sitting at the table with a pretty 18-year-old girl he'd been hanging out with that week. 'Do you want to smoke a joint?' he asked me. </p> <p>Back in Michigan, I automatically would have answered no. But being in this new environment made me adventurous. So my dad got out a thick black American Heritage Dictionary box. He opened the box, and it was full of weed. Using the lid as a preparation area, he broke off some of the pot, letting the seeds roll down to the bottom of the lid. Then he took out some rolling papers and showed me exactly how to roll a perfectly formed joint. I found it fascinating. </p> <p>Then he lit up the joint and passed it to me. 'Don't take too much. You don't want to cough your lungs out,' he counselled. </p> <p>I took a little drag and then gave the joint back to him. It went around the table a few times, and soon we were all laughing and feeling really mellow. And then I realised I was high. I loved the sensation. It felt like medicine to soothe the soul and awaken the senses. There was nothing awkward or scary - I didn't feel like I had lost control - in fact, I felt like I was in control. </p> <p>Then my dad handed me an Instamatic camera and said: 'I think she wants you to take some pictures of her.' I instinctively knew that some form of skin was about to be exposed, so I said to her: 'What if we pull up your shirt and I'll take a picture of you?' </p> <p>'That's a good idea, but I think it might be more artistic if you just had her expose one of her breasts,' my dad said. We all concurred. I took some pictures, and no one felt uncomfortable about it. </p> <p>My priority that fall was to get into a good junior high school. I was supposed to enrol in Bancroft, but when we went to check it out, we saw that the building was in a shady neighborhood and scarred with all sorts of gang graffiti. The place just didn't scream out: 'Let's go to school and have fun here.' So my dad drove us to Emerson, which was in Westwood. It was a classic California Mediterranean building, with lush lawns and flowering trees and an American flag waving proudly in the breeze. Plus, everywhere I looked, there were these hot little 13-year-olds walking around in their tight Ditto jeans. 'Whatever it takes, I want to go here,' I said. </p> <p>What it took was using Sonny Bono's Bel Air address as my own. One of my dad's former girlfriends, Connie, had left him for Sonny, who had recently split with Cher. But everyone stayed friendly, and I'd met Sonny on my previous visit and he was fine with the deception, so I enrolled. </p> <p>The Sonny and Cher Show was probably the biggest thing on television then, and Sonny was always generous about ensuring that I'd get whatever extra care I needed. One time I was at his Bel Air mansion during a star-studded Hollywood party. I didn't care about the Tony Curtises of the world at that point, so I started going up and down in the mansion's old carved-wood elevator. Suddenly, I got stuck between floors, and they had to use a giant fireman's axe to free me. I knew I was in big trouble, but Sonny never screamed at me or demeaned me in front of all the adults who were watching this rescue. He just calmly taught me to respect other people's property and not play in things that weren't made to be played in. </p> <p>At the same time, my bond with my dad got stronger and stronger. As soon as I had moved in with him, he instantly became my role model and my hero, so everything I could do to bolster the solidarity between us was my mission. It was also his. We were a team. Naturally, one of our bonding experiences was to go on his pot-smuggling escapades. I became his cover for these trips. We'd take seven giant Samsonite suitcases and fill them up with pot. At the airport, we'd go from one airline to another, checking in these bags, because at that time they didn't even look to see if you were on that flight. We'd land at a major airport, collect all the suitcases, and drive to someplace like Kenosha, Wisconsin. </p> <p>On our Kenosha trip, we checked into a motel, because my dad's transactions were going to take a couple of days. I was adamant that I wanted to go with him when the deal went down, but he was dealing with badass biker types, so he sent me to a movie, which turned out to be the new James Bond flick, Live and Let Die. The transactions took place over a three-day weekend, so I wound up going to that movie every day we were there, which was fine with me. </p> <p>We had to return to LA with 30 grand in cash. My dad told me I'd be carrying the money, because if they caught someone who looked like him with all that money, he'd be busted for sure. That was fine with me. I'd much prefer to be part of the action than be sitting on the sidelines. So we rigged a belt piece, stuffed it with the cash, and taped it to my abdomen. 'If they try to arrest me, you just fade away,' he instructed me. 'Just pretend you're not with me and keep on going.' </p> <p>We made it back to LA, and I later found out that my dad was only getting $200 a trip to mule that pot for friends. I also discovered that he was supplementing that meagre income with a nice steady cash inflow from a growing coke-dealing business. </p> <p>There were a lot of people coming by, but not as many as you would think. My dad was fairly surreptitious about his dealings, and he knew the risk would increase with a lot of activity. But what his clientele lacked in quantity, it sure made up for in quality. There were plenty of movie stars and TV stars and writers and rock stars, and tons of girls. </p> <p>It was hard to convince me that we weren't living large, especially on the weekends, when my dad took me out nightclubbing, where he was known as the Lord of the Sunset Strip. (He was also known as Spider, a nickname he had picked up in the late Sixties when he scaled a building to get into the apartment of a girl he was fixated on.) </p> <p>Sunset Strip in the early Seventies was the artery of life that flowed through West Hollywood. People constantly jammed the street, shuttling between the best clubs In town. There was the Whisky a Go Go and Filthy McNasty's. Two blocks from the Whisky was the Roxy, another live music club. Across the parking lot from the Roxy was the Rainbow Bar and Grill. The Rainbow was Spider's domain. Every night he'd get there around nine and meet up with his posse. </p> <p>We'd be at the Rainbow most of the night. He didn't stay put at the table the whole time, just long enough for his anchors to arrive to hold down the table, and then they'd all take turns making the rounds within the restaurant bar area, or going upstairs. I always loved the upstairs club. Whenever one of my dad's girlfriends would want to dance, she'd ask me, because Spider was not a dancer. </p> <p>The night wouldn't be complete without cocaine, and it became a great sport to see how clandestinely you could consume your blow. The experienced coke hounds were easy to spot, because they all had the right-pinkie coke fingernail. They'd grow that pinkie at least a good half-inch past the finger and shape it perfectly, and that was the ultimate coke spoon of the time. My dad took great pride in his elaborately manicured coke nail. But I also noticed that one of his nails was far shorter than the rest. </p> <p>'What's up with that one?' I asked. </p> <p>'That's so I don't hurt the ladies down below when I'm using my finger on them,' he said. Boy, that stuck in my mind. I was the only child present for all this insanity. For the most part, the adults who didn't know me just ignored me. But Keith Moon, the drummer for the Who, always tried to make me feel at ease. In the midst of this chaotic, riotous, party-life atmosphere where everyone was screaming and shouting and sniffing and snorting and drinking and humping, Moon would take the time to be still and take me under his arm and say: 'How you doing, kid? Are you having a good time? Shouldn't you be in school or something? Well, I'm glad you're here, anyway.' </p> <p>All of this was taking an emotional toll on me, in ways that I couldn't even articulate. Even though I had friends at Emerson school, and I was going to the Rainbow on weekends as my dad's sidekick, I was alone a lot and starting to create my own world. I had to get up in the morning and go to school and be a guy in his own private bubble. I didn't mind it, since I had this space to pretend in and create in and think in and observe in. Sometime that year, one of the neighbour's cats had kittens, and I used to take one of the fluffy white kittens up on the roof of the garage apartment behind us to hang out with. He was my little friend, but at times, I would scold that kitten, for no reason other than to exert power over him. During one of these scolding sessions, I started thumping the kitty in the face with my fingers. It wasn't anything deadly, but it was an act of aggression, which was strange, because I'd always been an animal lover. </p> <p>As soon as I moved in with my dad, the idea of having sex also became a priority for me. Girls my age at Emerson wanted nothing to do with me. My father had a succession of beautiful young teenage girlfriends whom I couldn't help fantasising about, but I couldn't quite get up the nerve to approach them. Then he started seeing a girl named Kimberly. </p> <p>Kimberly was a beautiful, softly-spoken 18-year-old redhead with snow-white skin and huge, perfectly formed breasts. She had an ethereal, dreamy personality that was typified by her adamant refusal to wear her glasses despite terrible nearsightedness. I once asked her if she could see without them, and she said that things were very fuzzy. So why didn't she wear the glasses? 'I prefer the world unclear,' she said. </p> <p>One night shortly before my twelfth birthday, we were all at the Rainbow. I was high as a little kite on a quaalude, and I got up the courage to write my father a note: 'I know this is your girlfriend, but I'm pretty sure she's up for the task so if it's okay with you, can we arrange a situation where I end up having sex with Kimberly tonight?' </p> <p>He brokered the deal in a flash. She was game, so we went back to the house, and he said: 'Okay, there's the bed, there's the girl, do what you will.' My father's bed was bizarre to begin with, because he had piled four mattresses on top of one another to create an almost thronelike effect. He was a little too present for my taste, and I was nervous enough as it was, but Kimberly did everything. She guided me the whole way, and she was very loving and gentle, and it was all pretty natural. I can't remember if it lasted five minutes or an hour. It was just a blurry, hazy, sexy moment. </p> <p>It was a fun thing to do, and I never felt traumatised then, but I think subconsciously it always stuck with me in a weird way. I didn't wake up the next morning going, 'Geez, what the hell was that?' I woke up wanting to go brag about it to my friends and find out how I could arrange for it to happen again. But that was the last time my dad ever let me do that. Whenever he'd have a new beautiful girlfriend, I'd say, 'Remember that night with Kimberly? How about if ...' </p> <p>He'd always cut me off. 'Oh, no, no, no. That was a one time deal. Don't even bring that up. It's not going to happen.' </p> <p>Around that time, I also had the wonderful experience of being babysat one night by Cher. I was in the eighth grade and still hanging with Sonny and Connie from time to time, and for some reason, they got jammed up, so Cher volunteered to watch me for the night. We camped out in her bedroom, having a heart-to-heart talk for hours on end, really getting to be friends for the first time. </p> <p>After a while, it was time for bed. Because it was a large house and I might get spooked being alone, Cher let me crash on her bed until Sonny and Connie arrived. In my mind, there was a bit of tension - not that I was going to make any moves on this woman, just the idea that I'd be in bed with such a gorgeous creature. But I thought it was OK because we were friends. </p> <p>Then Cher got up to go to the bathroom and get ready for bed. It was dark in the bedroom, but light in the bathroom, so I watched her take off her clothes, all the while feigning to be on my way to sleep. There was a woman's naked body, and it was long and slender and special and just thrilling. Not that I had the wherewithal to want some physical relationship with her, but in my mind, it was a stimulating and semi-innocent moment. After she put on her nightgown, she walked back into the room and got into bed. I remember thinking, 'This is not bad, lying next to this beautiful lady.' </p> <p>Sex was still pretty sporadic for me at the age of 13. But even then there wasn't a kid I knew who was getting laid. Every one of my friends was destined to stay a virgin for the next few years, so part of the joy for me was going to school the next day and telling my friends, 'Hey, I spent the night with a girl.' They were like, 'Whoa, that's beyond comprehension.' </p> <p>I'll never forget my first day of high school. I arrived at Uni High and checked in with my counsellor to get my class assignment. Then she dropped the bombshell. 'Tony, I know you've been going to Emerson for three years under a false address. Because you don't live in the district, you can't go to school here.' </p> <p>I didn't know it then, of course, but that was one of the most eventful twists of fate I'd ever experience. </p> <p>I went home to figure out which high school was in my district. It turned out to be Fairfax High, a sprawling school on the corner of Fairfax and Melrose. I went there the next day and felt like an alien in a sea of people who already knew one another. Because I was a day late, a lot of the classes I wanted were full. I didn't know any students, I didn't know any teachers, I didn't even know where the cafeteria was. </p> <p>I started filling out my class forms, and when they asked for my name, I impulsively wrote 'Anthony' instead of 'Tony.' When roll was called, the teachers all called out 'Anthony Kiedis,' and I didn't correct them. I just became Anthony - this slightly different guy who was more mature, more in control, more adult. </p> <p>Once again, I started befriending all of the loneliest and the most unwanted kids in school. My first friends were Ben Tang, a scrawny, uncoordinated, huge-bespectacled Chinese kid, and Tony Shurr, a pasty-faced 98-pound weakling. About a month into the school year, Tony and I were talking in the quad at lunchtime when a tiny, crazy-looking, gap-toothed, big-haired kid came waltzing up to Tony, put him in a headlock, and started roughing him up. I couldn't tell at first if this was friendly fooling around or if the guy was bullying my best friend at Fairfax, so I erred on the side of friendship. I stepped in, grabbed him off Tony, and hissed, 'If you touch him again, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.' </p> <p>'What are you talking about? He's my friend,' the kid protested. </p> <p>It's weird. Even though we were starting off on this 'I'll kick your ass' aggressiveness, I felt an instant connection to the remarkable little weirdo. Tony told me his name was Michael Balzary, soon to be known beyond the confines of Fairfax High as Flea. </p> <p>Mike was another outsider at Fairfax. He had been born in Australia and was painfully shy and insecure, so I assumed the alpha role in the relationship. This would be the dynamic that would continue for a long time, and it would be a beautiful thing, because we shared so much together. However, it would also carry an aspect of resentment for him, because I was kind of a bastard and a mean-spirited bully at times along the way. </p> <p>Mike's mom was a real sweetheart, even if she had a bizarre Australian accent. But for the first few months I knew him, Mike kept talking to me about his older sister, Karen, who was back in Australia. 'She's a wildcat,' he'd tell me. 'She's really hot. She's got a million boyfriends, and she's the best gymnast at Hollywood High. She went streaking in the middle of a citywide competition.' I had to meet this Balzary sister. </p> <p>Later that school year, Karen finally showed up. She was young and foxy and incredibly forward. By then it was common for Mike and me to sleep over at each other's houses. In fact, Mike's room had two tiny cot beds, one for him and one for me. His family had a hot tub in the backyard, and one night Mike, Karen, and I were in the tub drinking some wine. Karen's hand was continually wandering over to me under those bubbles, and when Mike called it a night and I was about to do the same, Karen grabbed me. 'You stay,' she implored. Time to meet the sister. </p> <p>Karen immediately took charge. She started making out with me, then took me back to her bedroom, where she spent the next three hours introducing me to a variety of sexual experiences I hadn't thought possible. </p> <p>The next day Mike asked, 'How was my sister?' I spared him the details because, after all, she was his sister, but I did thank him profusely for introducing us. Years and years later, he came to me and said: 'We're really good friends, but this is something that's been bothering me for years. While you were in the room with my sister, I went outside the house and was peeping through the window for a few seconds.' By then I couldn't have cared less, but it was probably a good thing that he waited as long as he did to tell me. </p> <p><strong>'We're the red hot chili peppers, goddamn it!'</strong><br></p> <p>Anthony Kiedis reflects on further highs and lows in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' career: </p> <p><strong>1983 </strong> The fledgling band meet a lawyer for the first time. 'We decided to moon the lady at reception. \"We're the Red Hot Chili Peppers, goddamn it, and we want to see Eric ...\", and we dropped our trousers.' </p> <p><strong> 1988</strong> Original guitarist Hillel Slovak dies of a heroin overdose: </p> <p>'I went into denial. He was my best pal, but I was dying of the same thing that killed him.' </p> <p>Drummer Jack Irons leaves: </p> <p>'Jack said: \"I don't want to be part of something where my fucking friends are dying.\" We understood.' </p> <p><strong> 1991 </strong> The band's masterpiece, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, is released.</p> <p>'We all knew we were doing our best work yet and we had created something that was real and strong and beautiful.' </p> <p><strong> 1992 </strong> Guitarist John Frusciante leaves: </p> <p>'I resented him for abandoning our musical comradeship.' </p> <p><strong> 1997 </strong> While in India, Kiedis visits the Dalai Lama. </p> <p>'He cupped my hand in his hand and looked me in the eye. \"Anthony. Welcome to India ... we have to get a picture of you and I.\" </p> <p>\"If there's anything I can do let me know,\" I said. </p> <p>\"If [Beastie Boy] Adam Yauch ever calls you to play a festival for us, please make yourself available.\"' </p> <p><strong> 1998 </strong> Frusciante returns: 'One day in April, Flea went over there and they sat together and listened to records.

  "Because Nicholas used to be Nadia, the Irish state refuses to recognise his marriage. Now the 32-year-old Russian businessman who was born a woman is taking legal action to force the government to accept that his birth certificate can be changed. <p>Ireland is the last of only three countries in the Council of Europe which does not treat transgender people equally. Like Albania and Andorra, the Republic does not allow post-operative transsexuals to alter their birth certificates. </p> <p>A successful entrepreneur in the import/export business, Nicholas Krivenko says he and his German wife, Sybille Hintze, will be forced to leave Ireland if the state continues to deny them residency on the basis of not recognising their marriage. The couple live in Quin, Co Clare and married legally and in full knowledge of the registrar in a civil ceremony in Limerick City five years ago. </p> <p>'Nowhere on the marriage form did it say \"Have you changed your sex?\" But I gave the registrar my old birth certificate as a girl, my new one and a translation of them from Russian into English at the ceremony. I did not hide my past. I gave them the opportunity to find out.' </p> <p>The Krivenkos problems started when he applied for residency and the right to apply for jobs in Ireland. </p> <p>'A member of the gardai [police] said he couldn't sign our application because he knew I had changed sex. When our application was processed, the state objected to the validity of the marriage. They said \"We can't accept Nadia to Nicholas.\" ' </p> <p>Nicholas fought a legal battle to gain full residency status, which if the couple moved to Germany would have been automatic. The Federal Republic recognises the marriages of transgender people. Nicholas had his sex change at a private clinic in Germany ten years ago. </p> <p>'We want to stay in Ireland because we have no problems with ordinary Irish people. When our problems started, people rallied around. Even the local butcher in our village came around to the house with his wife and a couple of bottles of wine. They said they came over to give us our support. As the evening went on, the butcher's wife said to me \"Now, I know you are a man because you've left the toilet seat up.\" The only prejudice we get is from central government.' </p> <p>The next step in the battle for legal recognition is for Nicholas to apply for unconditional residency. Following that, he will seek full Irish citizenship. </p> <p>'I think I have made something of a contribution to Irish society. When I arrived here in 1995 from Germany I was in charge of exporting 10 per cent of all Irish butter to Russia, over 120,000 tonnes. All my wife and I want is to be given full legal status because once they recognise the marriage I am entitled to apply for work as Sybille is an EU citizen. But if this doesn't work, we might resettle in Germany as there is no problem there.' </p> <p>Fluent in English and French as well as having a working knowledge of Japanese, Nicholas has lived all over the world. His father used to work for a state-owned trading company in the former Soviet Union. </p> <p>'We want to stay in Ireland if we can, but that will depend on getting the law changed that will allow me to apply for jobs. I'm entitled to work as self-employed but not to seek jobs in the employment market. Now we are still in limbo.' </p> <p>Nicholas is co-chair of the recently founded Transgender Equality Network Ireland (Temi). Sarah Duffy, 40, the network's co-founder, says it wants legislation similar to that introduced into the British parliament in July, which gave legal recognition in the UK to those who alter their gender. </p> <p>The Dublin-born pre-op transsexual says that the Dail and Senate should follow suit. </p> <p>'You change your name by deed poll in Ireland. You can change your gender on passports and drivers licences, even your social security documents. But in Ireland you still can't alter a birth certificate, even though being born in the wrong sex is a recognised medical condition. ' </p> <p>Sarah, who was only out in public as a woman for the second time in her life last Friday, adds that Temi will be using the European Human Rights Act as a means of forcing the Irish state to change the law regarding birth certificates. The Southern Health Board has recently granted Temi 5,000 euros to help build up a national network of the Irish transgender community. </p> <p>'In the 1970s and 80s, women fought for equality. In the 1990s, gays and lesbians won their struggle for equal rights with the ending of the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In the 21st century, we are the last group of people fighting the battle for personal freedom.' </p> <p>Nicholas meanwhile is adamant that he will not give up the fight to change Irish law for the transgendered. </p> <p>'Even Iran, in certain circumstances, allows for people to change their sex and all official documents changed thereafter. Why can't Ireland do the same?'</p>",
  "If 40 per cent of Americans still believe Saddam Hussein had a hand in the attacks of 9/11, it follows either that they are all very stupid or that they have been fed a whole lot of lies by somebody or other. <p>Never having been at all prepared to join the anti-American brigade, I am inclined towards the second of the two explanations, which, in turn, raises questions about the bias of the American media. </p> <p>From various accounts, it is clear that many American TV and radio stations nowadays make little or no attempt to broadcast the news in a relatively impartial spirit, instead pumping out undisguised propaganda for George W Bush and the Republican Party. The chief culprit is Fox, owned by Rupert Murdoch. </p> <p>Murdoch has been in trouble with the American authorities recently, but not for broadcasting propaganda. Instead, his company was fined $1 million for putting on a reality TV show in which topless prostitutes had cream licked from their bodies. In the supposedly civilised world which Mr Blair is trying to preserve from terrorist attacks, the normal course for a man responsible for such debased standards would be to make him a pariah, instead of which our politicians, including Blair and Howard, go out of their way to court him and his visitors in the hope of getting support from his various papers. The latest to do so - as guest of honour at a Murdoch seminar in New York - was our Culture Secretary, Tessa Jowell. </p> <p>If she were seriously concerned to promote culture, as her title suggests, Jowell would be doing her best to limit Murdoch's influence instead of grovelling to him like all the rest of them. </p> <p><b>Lay off Geldof</b> </p> <p>The call for more women judges went out again last week from the Lord Chancellor, with the underlying and unspoken assumption that the result would be a more understanding, more compassionate judiciary, one that would reflect the female 50 per cent of the population. The same argument is regularly made for bringing more and more women into Parliament. </p> <p>But in neither case is there much evidence to show that, given political or judicial power, women are any better at exercising it than men. </p> <p>Coincidentally, the call for more women judges comes at a time of renewed focus on the family courts - where women reign supreme - and the campaign, spearheaded by Bob Geldof, for greater justice for divorced and separated fathers in relation to their children. </p> <p>Geldof, who has dared to challenge the feminist orthodoxy that all men are bastards, has predictably brought down a shower of obloquy on his head from an array of lady columnists. But even these viragos cannot deny that the time has come to lift the curtain of secrecy that surrounds the workings of the family courts. </p> <p>It is not just the treatment of fathers that has raised disquiet. There are now a number of investigations in progress - again in secret - into cases where parents have been found guilty of killing their babies, purely on the say-so of the paediatrician, Sir Roy Meadow. </p> <p>The misery caused by these judges will be marked by more and more desperate protests. So far from being attacked, the blessed Geldof once again deserves the nation's thanks for drawing attention to a situation that the media have preferred to ignore. </p> <p><b>Talking tosh</b></p> <p>The creator of the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, the American 'landscape artist' Kathryn Gustafson, is in the same boat as Tony Blair insofar as she is being pressed to apologise for a terrible balls-up, although not for one that resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people, like the Reverend Blair's. </p> <p>Since it was opened by the Queen in July, the Diana Fountain has failed to function on a variety of occasions, due to fallen leaves, misbehaving dogs, etc. Even now, it is still surrounded by a metal fence. </p> <p>Like Blair, however, Gustafson is only prepared to offer a qualified and somewhat halfhearted apology. 'I feel we made a mistake letting people walk in the water,' she told the Guardian last week. 'I apologise for that.' </p> <p>So, if anything has gone wrong, it is almost certainly the fault of the British public; for coming in too great numbers and then not just for walking in the water and failing to keep their dogs under control but, most importantly, for failing to appreciate her imaginative work of art. </p> <p>In case people are still not getting the message, Gustafson, who admitted that she knew practically nothing about Diana until her death in 1997, explained: 'Her secret garden, her inner self, her basic integrity stayed with her. That's why it's an oval. It's also contemporary, feminine and flowing like her.' So now you know.</p>",
  "They cremated him last Wednesday. Now I'll have to redo that list - the emergency numbers pinned on a kitchen cupboard: police, ambulance, fire brigade... You need them in Johannesburg. The list had four names of 'dependable blokes'. The first was Andrew Meintjes's. <p>Meintjes was an engineer, as well as a photographer. Engineers tend to be practical types - the sort you want in an emergency. He did a lot of dreaming, too, and what made him exceptional was that he turned dreams into reality. His hi-fi amplifier, for instance, was truly a dream of spheres - and it worked like a dream. He built just a few, quickly realising that to be successful he would have to go into mass production, and he was no more interested in mass production than Vincent Van Gogh. </p> <p>I'm not saying he was a Van Gogh, although one newspaper, the Star, said in a report of his murder that he was a genius. And his Panfield was a piece of art as much as it was a camera - a symphony in glass, steel and fabric. Like the amplifier, he made only a few, snapped up by architectural photographers around the world as an artistic creation and an invaluable tool. </p> <p>His great project was never completed. He wanted to build a camera obscura for Johannesburg and was commissioned to do so by the Africa Museum, but it ran out of money. </p> <p>Andrew had a thing about central Johannesburg. My guess is that it was again the engineer in him - he could not bear the waste of all the fine buildings standing empty as if a neutron bomb had depopulated the place. In a way it had: the neutron bomb of crime. </p> <p>So it was no surprise when he started photographing those buildings, renting himself an office in adjoining Braamfontein. This gave him a magnificent view of the city centre and the new Nelson Mandela Bridge, intended to lead the regeneration of the city. It was as if he wanted to oversee the rejuvenation process. </p> <p>Andrew had a dream of hitting the jackpot with an invention. He had just finished helping his wife Lorna realise her ambition of getting a law degree, and that had hit his pocket. He had been married before. They had a daughter, but gave her up for adoption. Recently the girl, now a blonde beauty called Frances, came looking for him. She is a musicologist and they built steel didjeridoos. He taught her photography. </p> <p>His dreams of 'making it' seemed about to be realised recently when he emerged as the country's leading photographic printer. Investing in a couple of monster inkjet printers, he began churning out dazzling digital prints. Soon he had virtually every professional photographer clamouring - which was when he decided to move his equipment from his home to his office. </p> <p>Earlier this month President Thabo Mbeki denounced as 'racists' those who draw attention to crime in the country and suggest it is rising. He said such reports depict African people 'as savages'. So it is at risk of being non-PC that one records that they came for Andrew - calling his name - as he was about to leave for home, shortly before 6pm. They tied him up, but he untied himself and went for them. One shot him - once in the leg, once in the chest and three times in the back - before seemingly running out of ammunition. </p> <p>They got away with a mobile phone. And the life of a dependable guy.</p>",
  "Traffic wardens rank alongside tax inspectors and estate agents as people we love to hate. But now they are undergoing an image make-over in a bid to boost their popularity with motorists. <p>NCP, Britain's biggest parking company, has begun issuing staff with brightly coloured uniforms in red or royal blue, or with high-visibility vests, so that drivers cannot accuse them of lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce with a parking ticket. Workers are also being given anger management and conflict resolution training. </p> <p>And 'mystery shoppers' are being employed to roam the streets and check how wardens are doing their job. </p> <p>Bob Macnaughton, NCP's group chief executive, wants to restore public trust in its work and protect staff from 'parking rage'. Threats, intimidation and racist abuse are commonly experienced by wardens. Several attendants each month are hit by cars, and there have been a number of assaults. A poster was put up by shopkeepers in Manchester last week with a photograph of their local warden titled 'The fat bitch traffic warden from Mars'. </p> <p>Public anger has been fuelled by a feeling that tickets are being wrongly issued because wardens are under pressure to meet targets or want to claim bonuses. </p> <p>However, Macnaughton wants to tackle what he claims are often unfair criticisms. 'Parking attendants have never had a good image ... but I'm concerned the language used to describe them has gone too far,' he said. </p> <p>In Manchester, where wardens have new red uniforms, NCP attendant Mike Grey said it was already a success: 'Before we were in navy, and people said \"I never saw you hiding\", whereas now we have a high visibility.' </p> <p>Motoring and freight groups said that the changes were welcome, but more needed to be done. </p> <p>The Freight Transport Association said that wardens should have more power to discriminate, which could allow them to be more lenient. The RAC Foundation wants a 'root-and-branch review', particularly of targets and of councils' use of discrimination in appeals. </p> <p>But no number of improvements will ever change the fact that the traffic warden's job is inherently unpopular, admits Grey. </p> <p>'I don't think that we'll ever be loved: people have always got to have someone to hate'.</p>",
  "<p>I am standing in an overcrowded art gallery in downtown Manhattan, feeling slightly queasy. In front of me, taking up most of the wall, is a huge photograph of a naked girl engaged in the kind of sexual act that defies description here. Let's just say that her hair is in a mess. There are many questions going through my head at this moment, not least why an image of this kind has ended up in an art gallery. </p> <p>It's then that I notice the familiar-looking young woman standing beside me. She is wearing a dress that redefines the terms skimpy and diaphanous, and she is giggling uncontrollably. At herself. She is the same young woman who is up there on the wall. Her companion is staring open-mouthed at the photograph, his face registering what can only be described as a mixture of shock and awe. He turns to her in disbelief. 'You didn't!' he shrieks. 'You didn't!'</p> <p>But, as several other images on the walls attest, she did. Over and over. The gallery is bedecked with similar photographs: naked and glistening young girls, their legs akimbo, backsides thrust in the air, lipsticked mouths open in anticipation. Sometimes there is just one girl, snapped from above in an act of oral devotion, or in a post-coital daze; sometimes there are two, occasionally three. Sometimes, on closer inspection, the girls turn out to be boys, or boy-girls, their petite penises dangling helplessly between their long feminine legs. </p> <p>The only penis that does not dangle belongs to the photographer whose name graces the show, and whose naked frame and goofy, bespectacled face features throughout. His name is Terry Richardson, and the whole show consists of self-made images of Terry thrusting, rucking, prodding, pumping and, sometimes, grinning at the camera like a nerd let loose in porno heaven. </p> <p>Most people here tonight seem to find the show inexplicably funny, and there is a queue to buy the Terryworld T-shirts and condoms. Others, though, do a swift about-turn as soon as they have made it through the bottleneck at the door. It's all too much. Too crude. Too in-your-face. Too numbingly, thrashily hard-core. Here, for instance, is Terry being serviced by two babes who could be, may well be, fashion models. Here he is receiving a blow job from a girl who, for some reason, is trussed up in a suitcase, just her head - and open mouth - protruding. And here he is being fellated by another girl crammed into a dustbin. </p> <p>In this context, the work of the late Helmut Newton seems positively tame, quaint even. The Terryworld show would have a London gallery closed down within hours. And yet here it is in the heart of Manhattan's art world, in a reputable SoHo space, the Deitch Gallery, drawing the biggest crowd of the year. The street outside is thronged with the thin and the cool: fashionistas, agents, artists, countless hangers-on. There are even one or two celebrities, including art-rocker Kim Gordon, film director Wes Anderson, and actor/director Vincent Gallo, whom, one suspects, is grateful to be invited anywhere since his recent public espousal of ultra-conservative Republicanism. </p> <p>'Terry is one of the more charismatic figures in downtown culture,' the gallery owner, Jeffrey Deitch, will later tell the New York Observer, and tonight's impromptu block party certainly attests to that. One whole stretch of Wooster Street has been cordoned off by the NYPD, such is the crowd milling about. There is a Red Cross emergency worker stationed inside the airless and overcrowded space. Terryworld is a strange and contradictory place where art and fashion and pornography converge, and where, for the time being at least, pornography is the dominant aesthetic.</p> <p>'Do you really think it's porn?' Terry Richardson asks me a few days later, as we sit on the rather dilapidated patio of his first-floor studio-cum-apartment overlooking the Bowery. Terry is dressed in a black T-shirt and work pants, white socks and trainers. He is smaller than his photographs suggest, and has a less cartoonish face: short-cropped hair, receding at the temples, a handlebar moustache and big, tinted, Seventies specs that exaggerate his geekiness. His muscular arms are covered in tattoos: old-fashioned sailor-type images of busty girls, strange hieroglyphics, an elaborate inky black spider's web that spreads around one elbow. </p> <p>Terry's pad is typical Lower East Side boho - open-plan, with a kitchen at one end and a den at the other, a double bed built into a niche in one wall. There are various black-and-white photographs of girls, street dudes and punk groups arranged here and there on the wall, but not, as far as I can see, any of his own work. Interestingly, he lives on the same street as CBGB's, the legendary punk dive, and close to a street recently renamed Joey Ramone Place. This is Terry's 'hood', and, as befits a guy who borrowed the DIY ethic of punk and applied it to photography, he feels emotionally at home here. He belongs. </p> <p>Me, I feel oddly guilty, because Terry is affable and open, obviously more sensitive than his more extreme work suggests, and I seem to have offended him by suggesting that the recent photographs he has taken of himself having sex with various young girls might be pornographic. </p> <p>'The thing is, I don't personally like porn,' he says, shaking his head, and sucking on the first of several cigarettes he will get through over the next few hours, his voice sounding even deeper than usual due to all the talking he has done since the show's opening. 'Porn kind of bums me out because there is so much sadness and pain in that world. So little joy or even pleasure. I don't use porn or even go to strip clubs, like a lot of my friends. I don't like to exploit anybody. That's not my bag. Everyone has fun on my shoots.' </p> <p>This would indeed seem to be the case. The girls who now come knocking on the door of Terry Richardson's studio to take part in what he calls his 'spontaneous sex acts' may be young or impressionable, exhibitionist or insecure, or all of the above, but they are all too eager and willing to perform for his camera. It's as if all the hoary old cliches about the camera as phallus, the photographer as power-hungry sexual predator \u00e1 la David Hemmings in Blow-Up, have come true with a vengeance in his work, except that he does not have to cajole or pressurise his subjects. They're queuing up. </p> <p>'My rule is that I'd never ask anyone to do anything I wouldn't do myself,' he says, 'that's how it's got to go this far. At first, I'd just want to do a few nude shots, so I'd take off my clothes, too. I'd even give the camera to the model and get her to shoot me for a while. It's about creating a vibe, getting people relaxed and excited. When that happens,' he adds, grinning his goofy, adolescent grin, 'you can do anything.' </p> <p>For the uninitiated among you, it's important to understand how much in demand and influential Richardson is as a fashion photographer in order to even begin to understand how he gets away with all the other stuff he does. Fashion, in case you needed reminding, is a kind of parallel universe, where the normal rules of behaviour - social, moral, ethical - do not apply. Fashion designers, art directors and magazine editors have flirted with heroin chic, anorexic chic and even terrorist chic, but porn chic has proved the most enduring aesthetic. </p> <p>A cursory glance at recent back issues of style magazines such as Dazed &amp; Confused and Pop, as well as occasional issues of high-end titles like Vogue, indicates the dominance of faux-porn imagery as the abiding style attitude. Terry is the undisputed king of porn chic. </p> <p>'He's the ultimate manifestation of the myth of the promiscuous photographer,' says Charlotte Cotton, a curator at the Photographer's Gallery in London, 'and his fashion work to date has played around with that myth and, in the process, had a real pertinence in an industry that tends to be conservative and anodyne. But photography is also about context, and you have to be careful when you move into the very different context of an art gallery. Just presenting sexual images, some would say pornographic images, in terms of their content alone, is not enough. Nor is parading your psychosexuality. You have to find a way to be more clever than that.'</p> <p>Terry Richardson, though, has no truck with cleverness for art's sake, has no real issues with whether his work is deemed art or porn. Richardson is just doing his thing. This month, art publisher Taschen will put out Terryworld, a retrospective that shares the same name as his Deitch show, but mixes the sleazier stuff with fashion photographs, celebrity portraits and even the odd landscape. What is arresting about the book is not the hardcore sex, but the intimacy of some of the portraits: a blissfully grinning child who has just been feeding at his mother's breast; Dennis Hopper, his face wreathed in cigarette smoke. Ironically, Richardson has a gift for tenderness that is not always evident in his pathological pursuit of the sexually shocking. </p> <p>Confusingly, there is also an even more sumptuous book called Kibosh, published by Damiani, which features the harder stuff from the Deitch show, and retails at around \u00a3300. 'That's the strange thing in all this,' elaborates Stephen Male, an art director who once worked with Richardson on an early Levi's campaign. 'We suddenly have a few prominent photographers who are dealing with their sexual neuroses, and for some reason we're all expected to watch. Even stranger is that many of us do just that.'</p> <p>Richardson first came to prominence in the mid-Nineties, shooting fashion editorials and ads that were starkly lit, brutally cropped and shot on snapshot cameras with little or no lighting. His primitive-cool aesthetic was the direct antithesis of the glossy, big-production work of other fashion photographers such as Nick Knight or Stephen Meisel, and had a more obvious sexual edge than other purveyors of the snapshot aesthetic such as Juergen Teller and Corinne Day. </p> <p>In recent years, Richardson's signature advertising campaigns for labels like Katharine Hamnett, where the models' pubic hair was visible beneath their short skirts, and Sisley, where, memorably, the model Josie Moran squeezed milk from a cow's udder into her mouth, established him as a photographer prepared to push the boundaries about as far as many assumed they could go. And, in a way, this has been the case. Richardson's fashion work still tends to be edgy - he has made Kate Moss, minus her knickers, look like a world-weary call girl in the latest issue of Pop - but he has shown an increasing tendency to adapt to meet the more mainstream demands of the client. His current campaign for Miu Miu, featuring the young actor Maggie Gyllenhaal, is opulent and romantic, a world away from open crotches and post-coital poses. </p> <p>But over the past few years, Richardson's non-fashion photography, which he considers his most important work, has gone the other way, his images becoming ever more hardcore in their depiction of Terry's own sex life. Everyone in fashion had heard about the 'spontaneous sexscapades' that occurred from time to time when Terry and a model hit it off. When word got out about them, though, he found that certain girls would turn up with exactly that in mind. Soon, the shoots got wilder, and often Terry's assistants, Seth and Keiji, had to be on hand to take the actual pictures. 'I always say I make pictures rather than take pictures,' explains Terry. It turns out that Alex, a blonde waif who works in his office, is a posh art student who originally assisted Terry on a Miu Miu campaign. Now, she is up there on the wall with the rest of them, captured for posterity fellating her boss from inside the office rubbish bin. </p> <p>Soon, Terry had shot hundreds of similar images, all featuring himself in flagrante with a female volunteer. His psychosexual archive, he tells me, 'is the most satisfying and exciting work I have ever done'. Leaving aside for a moment the obvious question about whether a pornographic image can ever possess artistic merit, many of these photographs seem grounded in, at one extreme, adolescent fantasy gone mad, and, at the other, some darker personal demons - narcissism, obsession, compulsion, even addiction. </p> <p>'Oh, I have lots of stuff I am working out through my work,' he freely admits, though one suspects he tends to view his neuroses the way the rest of us might view our hobbies. 'I mean, I don't think I'm a sex addict, if that's what you're asking, but I do have issues, tons of them. Like, this current show could be about my midlife crisis. Or it could be something to do with the fact that since I gave up drinking and taking drugs, I have to get high on sex and being an exhibitionist. Or maybe it's the psychological thing that I was a shy kid, and now I'm this powerful guy with his boner, dominating all these girls. In a way, that's the very stuff I'm trying to work out in the work.' </p> <p>I ask if it has ever crossed his mind that his 'stuff' might be better worked out in private? 'Why?' he replies, in all seriousness. 'I mean, I'm a photographer. I record stuff. Why not record myself? I'm only doing what everybody else does behind closed doors. They take Polaroids of their girlfriends, then they hide them in a drawer, or post them on the internet with her face blacked out. That seems a whole lot less healthy to me. That's about shame and fear. I just do it all, and put it all out there. That's what's incredibly liberating.' </p> <p>So, it's photography as therapy? The nerd's revenge, maybe? He gives this some thought. 'Partly, but not only. Look, I'm just a regular guy who's trying to deal with things, and figure stuff out as I go along. If people want to call it porn, that's cool with me. If people are shocked or offended by it, that's even better. A guy came up to me on the street yesterday, and started shouting, \"I hate your show. I hate all your fucking pictures.\"' What did you do? 'I thanked him.'</p> <p>By all reports, Terry Richardson was once a neurotically shy young man. And, before that, a sad and angry child. Until punk provided a vehicle for his self-destructive urges, he used to smash things up, furniture mainly, but sometimes himself. His anger first surfaced when he was four and his father Bob, a briefly successful fashion photographer, left his mother for the then 17-year-old actress Anjelica Houston. Terry's mother, in turn, took up with Jimi Hendrix and Keith Richards, and Terry once walked in on her making out with Kris Kristofferson. When he was nine, his mother was on her way to collect him from his child psychiatrist when a Pacific Bell telephone truck smashed into the back of her stationary Volkswagen. She was left with permanent brain damage, and in the charge of her already emotionally disturbed son.</p> <p>'It was shell shock, basically,' he says, quietly. 'One minute, I was flying around in jets, I had a colour TV in my bedroom; the next my mother and me were on welfare, living on food stamps. She was in diapers and barely able to move or communicate. It was a real tough time. I retreated into getting high on weed, and when I wasn't high, I was this angry, sad kid. There is not one photograph of me looking happy as a child. I was kind of lost for a long while.'</p> <p>Today, Terry has a tattoo of himself as a sad little kid on his upper torso, but, one suspects, the real scars run much deeper. He has made up with his wayward father, who, having been homeless for a long time, now lives on social security in California and, with Terry's help, plans to publish a book of his Seventies work. They briefly tried to work together, but it ended in tears. </p> <p>'We're close now, but it took a while. It's a beautiful and amazing thing to be able to hug him and tell him I love him, seeing as I tried to strangle him a few times, threw him across the apartment. All the classic father/son Greek mythology stuff.' </p> <p>After a stint in various Southern California punk bands, including SSA (Signal Street Alcoholics), Baby Fist and Middle Finger, and a brief early flirtation with heroin, Richardson started taking photographs in earnest in the early Nineties. He shot whatever caught his eye on the street, and made a fitful living assisting 'other guys who weren't half as original'. His inspirations were Nan Goldin and Larry Clarke, documentarians of their own broken lives, as well as William Eggleston, whom he calls 'a true American visionary'. Richardson's own breakthrough came when he was commissioned to do a street fashion story for Vibe magazine in 1991, and he responded by shadowing a gang of teenagers for a night, snapping them as they hung out. The influential British art director Phil Bicker saw the result, and promptly hired Richardson for a campaign he was doing for Katharine Hamnett. The rest, as they say, is fashion history.</p> <p>'Terry always did his own thing,' says Stephen Male, recalling those early days. 'I remember when the contact sheets came in for the Levi's shoot we did, every single one would feature a photograph of the model with her top off. I remember thinking, \"How did he do that?\" I mean, it wasn't really what was required for the shoot. Then it became Terry's thing. It seems almost quaint and old-fashioned now that we'd find it questionable. But that's fashion for you. Once somebody pushes the envelope, it doesn't take long for taboo images to become acceptable. Plus, fashion needs people like Terry; it needs to feel it has an edge all the time.' Terry, unsurprisingly, concurs. 'Hell, somebody's gotta come up once in a while and say bollocks to all that mainstream, glamour stuff.'</p> <p>One feels, though, that fashion photography is no longer enough for Terry Richardson, that the rush he got from recording, then displaying, his own X-rated reality show will be both a catalyst for his already hyperactive creative imagination, and a hard(core) act to follow. There are signs, too, that he may already be tiring of the sexual infamy that he has worked so hard to sustain. He has been commissioned to write and direct a feature film, Son of a Bitch, about a father who returns out of the past to derail his son's life. It will, he insists, be entirely free of sex scenes. </p> <p>'I love sex,' he says, 'and, above all, I love the first time I have sex with someone. That's the real buzz. Often girls have said to me: \"Terry, it was all downhill after the first fuck,\" and that's kind of true, I guess. Sometimes, lately, I find myself thinking I'd really love to settle down, get married, have kids, have a regular relationship.'</p> <p>Given his reputation, that may well remain wishful thinking, at least until he works through his compulsion to record his every casual sexual encounter on camera. His first marriage, to model Nikki Uberti, was short-lived and volatile, fuelled by copious amounts of Class A drugs. Richardson says any hopes of reconciliation were complicated by his efforts to stay off heroin, with which he had a long and fitful dependency. </p> <p>He has been drug-free for three years now, after a group of friends staged an intervention when they found him comatose in his apartment on Christmas Day 2001. </p> <p>'I was at the bottom, man. I'd just broken up with a girlfriend three days before, and I'd gone on a binge over Christmas. I'd done $100 worth of smack, taken a bunch of Valiums and drunk a bottle of vodka. I put on a suit and tie for Christmas, then it hit me that I was all alone. I went to sleep hoping that I wouldn't wake up. That's when the guys found me, and sent me off to rehab.'</p> <p>These days, clean if not altogether serene, Terry Richardson's personal life seems a lot less messy than it was before. He has just split up, though, with his model girlfriend, Susan Eldridge, but seems remarkably chilled about his current situation, despite the often tragic events that have dogged what he calls, with Disney innocence, 'his incredible journey'.</p> <p>'I felt I had to open up my soul and let all this stuff out,' he says, 'and then I could move on. I guess some people are more scared of me now than they were before, because they think I'm a crazy, exhibitionist nut.

  "Jerusalem's Christian community has demanded that Jewish leaders and the Israeli government take action against what they claim is growing harassment of their clergy by religious Jews. <p>Christians say ultra-Orthodox Jewish students spit at them or at the ground when they pass. There have also been acts of vandalism against statues of the Virgin Mary. </p> <p>The harassment came to a head last week when a Jewish student spat at Armenian Archbishop Nourhan Manougian and ripped off his crucifix, whereupon the archbishop slapped him. The police questioned both men. </p> <p>Mainstream Israeli opinion has been revolted by the revelations of the abuse of Christian clergy. Avraham Poraz, the interior minister, condemned the trend of spitting at the cross and those wearing it, saying it was 'intolerable' and that he was 'revolted' by it. A former chief rabbi also voiced his outrage. </p> <p>All the Christian groups complain of harassment, but the Armenians bear the brunt. Armenian clergymen said that, when they complained to the interior minister seven months ago, he told them: 'Most Jews have a big problem with them as well.' </p> <p>The 3,000-strong community live in the Armenian quarter and many Jews walk through it on their way from west Jerusalem to the Wailing Wall or Western Wall. </p> <p>Father Pakrad Bourjekian, a spokesman for the Armenian church, said the attack was an extreme example of the harassment they receive every day. 'Every day the fanatical Jews turn their face to the wall or spit on the ground or at us when they see the crucifix,' he said. </p> <p>The Christians admit that it is only a minority who carry out the abuse, but they feel that the issue is being ignored by religious leaders. </p> <p>Bishop Aris Shirvanian of the Armenian church said: 'The majority are courteous or indifferent. The problem is the very religious. It's a question of education. What must these people be learning to behave like this?' </p> <p>The old city of Jerusalem is buzzing with rumours that young Armenians will take revenge for the attack and the daily indignities suffered by their priests. </p> <p>Bishop Aris acknowledged that there was a danger of reprisals. 'We are trying to control our young people and we are succeeding. But the question is that there is no one in the Jewish community trying to control their fanatics,' he said. </p> <p>Father Pakrad added: 'There is no hierarchy. Anyone can become a rabbi, set up an institution, get funds from abroad and teach what they like.' </p> <p>Jerusalem has always been a city of conflict. Even the old Christian churches - the Armenian, Orthodox, Coptic, Syrian, Ethiopian and Catholic - are known for their disputes, which regularly result in brawls. </p> <p>In the current dispute, the Muslims, the old city's biggest group, are for once not involved. 'I do not think these Jews would dare spit at a Muslim sheikh; the whole city would explode. We are only a small group, so it easy to bully us,' said Bishop Aris.</p>",
  "Two weeks ago, one of his closest friends was shot dead outside a nightclub. At least 15 of his childhood friends have been killed in shootings and he believes it was only going to prison that saved his own life. <p>Wayne Rowe understands gun crime better than most - the devastating impact it can have on communities and the mentality of those who perpetrate it. The death of 14-year-old Danielle Beccan in a drive-by shooting in Nottingham last weekend struck a particular chord with the reformed street gangster. </p> <p>The Saturday before, Rowe's friend Mark Warmington was working as a bouncer at the Spotlight Club in Croydon. As he tried to stop a man who had shot two people inside the club from fleeing, the 39-year-old had the weapon turned on him. He was blasted in the chest at point-blank range. </p> <p>Rowe, also 39, knows he could easily have shared his friend's fate. He grew up on the tough Stockwell Park estate in South London and, like many of his peers, was drawn into the lifestyle of drugs, gangs and guns. But in 1996 fate intervened when Rowe got seven years in jail for being caught in possession of a fully-loaded MAC-10 sub-machine gun. He believes it saved his life. </p> <p>Since his release Rowe has dedicated himself to putting right some of his past wrongs. He set up the Straight Aims community project, an anti-gun initiative aimed at coaxing youths away from the culture and lifestyle that is claiming so many lives. </p> <p>'There's no great mystery to why there are so many guns out there,' he says. 'Guns are power. Guns are respect. And not just on the streets. Look at Bush, look at Blair, look at what's happening in Iraq. This is nothing to do with politics, I'm talking about perceptions that the youths grow up with. What they see is that the people with the most guns, the people with the biggest guns, they make the rules.' </p> <p>With more and more guns on the streets, Rowe adds, the greatest levels of respect are reserved for those willing to use their weapons. 'On the street reputation is everything. If you shoot someone, everyone knows about it. People say: \"Don't fuck about with that one, because you'll end up dead\". It means people overreact. You get a situation where someone doesn't even have a reason to shoot, but he does it anyway because he wants the rep that comes with pulling the trigger.' </p> <p>Rowe knows the importance of having a reputation from his Stockwell Park days. 'It was the kind of place where you had to be hard if you wanted to survive,' he says. 'You could either sneak around in the shadows or go out and make a name for yourself. </p> <p>'Then, like now, there was nothing for the kids to do. You end up feeling alienated because there is nothing for you. Then you see someone go past in a \u00a345,000 BMW with tinted windows, loud music and plenty of bling-bling and you think to yourself, I want a piece of that. </p> <p>'Once you get into the drugs, you have to protect yourself, so you have to get a gun. Once you have it, you feel indestructible. It's peer pressure as well. I didn't have any friends who were not into it. I got totally caught up with the lifestyle of being a gangster and all that it entailed.' </p> <p>Nowadays Rowe spends much of his time sharing his experiences with youths aged 15 to 24. 'They feel they can relate to me because I have been where they are. It's not like some social worker with a degree from Cambridge coming down and trying to get inside their heads. </p> <p>'I show them pictures of my dead friends. It hits home because these are the people that the kids in the gangs look up to and try to emulate. </p> <p>'The people involved in the shootings, they never think about the consequences. Talking about my friends, people who they know, is a way of getting through to them. Everyone has a heart, everyone has a conscience.' </p> <p>For many gang members, however, getting out is the hardest part, Rowe says. 'When you say you want to move on, the people you leave behind don't want you chatting about them and their business. I know people who have been killed by those they thought were their friends.' </p> <p>Rowe wants to expand his work, but is hampered by a lack of funds. 'You would think with everything that is going on they would be pouring money into these kind of projects, but that's not the case. I know it's having an effect and I want to be able to continue. Of all the things I've done with my life, nothing gives me the same satisfaction as working with the kids and helping them to turn their lives around.'</p> <p><b>The toll of the trigger</b></p> <p>Over a 12-month period there were almost 10,000 firearms incidents in England and Wales and 97 gun-related murders. Last year gun crime rose by 35 per cent. </p> <p>Police in Greater Manchester have estimated that those who get involved with gun crime should not expect to live beyond 24. In the past three years, 24 people under the age of 30 have been killed by guns on the streets of Manchester. </p> <p>Popular guns include the Brococks, a gas cartridge pistol that can be converted to fire live ammunition; the MAC-10 machine gun, and 9mm pistols, many of them brought back as trophies from the war in Bosnia.</p>",
  "It is a staple part of Moscow street life. Russians drink beer like Westerners drink de luxe coffee: in parks, on the street, on the Metro. But not for much longer. <p>The Russian government is to outlaw beer drinking on public transport, at sport stadiums, in the street or in parks. </p> <p>The measure from United Russia, the dominant pro-Putin party, would end a key characteristic of urban Russian life, where males, from schoolchildren to the elderly, idle away days and evenings standing drinking beer and chatting. </p> <p>Every Russian drinks an estimated 113 pints a year, a figure that has nearly doubled in the past decade as traditional vodka has been forsaken for lighter 'healthier' beer. The brew is as strong as 9 to 10 per cent alcohol, but this is considered non- or low-alcoholic. One survey suggests that peak consumption time is 7am. </p> <p>The Moscow Metro is often filled with the smell of early-morning tippling, as the commuters break into their first bottle of the day to get them going. Brewing is worth $6 billion a year in Russia, but it is taking its toll on the young. The country has 22,000 children registered as drink and drug addicts, and the numbers are rising. The Health Ministry believes that one in seven Russians is an alcoholic and that 40,000 people die annually from extreme intoxication. </p> <p>Yuri Medvedev, a United Russia MP, said the new law was suggested by the local parliament in the Siberian backwater of Omsk last July. 'We reinforced the first draft with a limit on drinking beer in public.' </p> <p>There was already to be a ban on beer advertising on TV between 7am and 10pm and on posters within 100 yards of a school, hospital or sports ground. </p> <p>The powerful beer industry claims the new laws will cost it between $500 million and $1.2 billion a year. The brewers want the public drinking plan to affect only minors. </p> <p>A parliamentary source close to the draft law said: 'We want to protect children from seeing adults drinking beer everywhere. We want to destroy this image of beer as a successful person's drink both in adverts and now in real life. Today you can easily see a young mother in a park breastfeeding her baby while drinking beer.'</p>",
  "A senior Baath party organiser and Saddam Hussein aide, Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed, has been named by western intelligence officials as one of the key figures directing the Sunni insurgency from his hiding-place in neighbouring Syria. <p>Sources have told The Observer that Younis al-Ahmed - who has had a $1 million price tag placed on his head by the US - is one of between 20 and 50 senior Baath party figures based in Syria who, they believe, are involved in organising the guerrilla war against the US-led multi-national forces in Iraq and against the new Iraqi security forces. </p> <p>The naming of Ahmed comes amid growing concern that hardline factions in Syria are providing protection for cells still loyal to the old Iraqi regime who were involved in organising the flow of money, people and material for fighters in Baghdad and the Sunni triangle. This is despite Syrian moves to tighten up its border with Iraq after complaints from Washington and London that arms and foreign terrorists were crossing into Iraq. </p> <p>The intelligence officials believe the activities of the Syrian-based former regime members - who quickly formed into cells after the fall of Saddam - may be a considerably more significant threat to the interim government of Ayad Allawi than the more widely visible activities of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who has been behind a series of beheadings and suicide bombings. </p> <p>Before the $1m bounty was placed on his head, Ahmed, also known as 'Khadr al-Sabahi', had been travelling between Syria and the Sunni triangle to direct fighting and disburse funds. More recently, however, say sources, he has remained in Syria, choosing not to risk capture by crossing the border. </p> <p>The naming of Ahmed, and the allegation that he is basing himself permanently in Syria, seems designed to pressure the Syrian authorities to clamp down on the activities of ex-regime officials operating there. </p> <p>Little is known about Ahmed save that he was a senior regional Baath party organiser with links to Saddam's feared internal intelligence service, and there is some suggestion he may have received training in Moscow at some point. </p> <p>'The main organisational strength behind the insurgency is Baathist military intelligence types who enjoy safe refuge in Syria,' said one official. 'So although Syria has clamped down on the border, they have not done anything about the planners and organisers. We are talking about 20-50 people who have access to funds, who know how to organise and use existing networks and are adept at reforming into cells.' </p> <p>The new assessment that former Baath party officials in hiding in Syria might, in reality, be more significant than Zarqawi and his foreign fighters, suggests an important change in emphasis in the understanding of the increasingly more violent insurgency. </p> <p>Zarqawi, some officials now believe, could not survive 'if he was not tolerated and exploited by the old Baathists'. </p> <p>The claim that Ahmed is continuing to direct the insurgency from inside Syria is a further embarrassment for the Anglophile President Bashar Assad, who has been keen to modernise his country. It follows an number of incidents of mortar-fire across the Syrian border towards US positions inside Iraq, most recently on Friday. And the disclosure of Ahmed's role from Syria comes amid growing concern in Baghdad and western capitals over the increasing evidence of destabilising external interference in Iraq's affairs. </p> <p>Both Arab and western diplomats admit that there is evidence of arms, money and fighters coming into Iraq from Saudi Arabia but that it is almost impossible to quantify at what level. Indeed, Saudi officials are as concerned with weapons coming into Saudi. </p> <p>The Saudis are also worried that a failed state in Iraq would allow terrorists to set up camps close to its vast border to target the kingdom. Officials believe Saudi money is helping to finance the jihadist groups in Iraq - like Zarqawi's Tawhid and Jihad group - but are not certain what amounts are involved. </p> <p>And while UK forces have been brought in to help seal the smuggling routes in the desert areas that border Jordan, control of the Iraq-Saudi border area is complicated by the huge distances, awkward terrain and difficult helicopter flying conditions. </p> <p>Iranian factions, centred around the Republican Guards and religious leaders in Qom, have also been accused of financing of Iraqi Shia political and militia groups including the firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr with the aim of 'pricking the US'. The disclosure, however, that it is largely regime officials who are leading and funding the insurgency, tapping into a widespread discontent among many Iraqis, will raise questions again over whether the resistance is conforming in large part to a plan prepared before the fall of Baghdad. </p> <p>'The idea that it was organised before the war is beginning to reassert itself,' says Dr Rosemary Hollis of Chatham House. 'There is a thesis that is gaining some currency with Arab nationalists that this definitely required a lot of preparation. There is also an increasingly long-term view, that they are playing a long game and, with a properly managed resistance, this is a conflict that can be won and that the Americans can be forced to go home.'</p>",
  "Your editorial (Comment, last week) refers dismissively to the simplistic politics of hindsight in respect of the invasion of Iraq. Yet it was known at the time that the invasion was not supported by the United Nations and that no evidence of a link between Saddam Hussein's regime and terrorist groups had been presented. <p>Hindsight may have confirmed that Saddam nursed malevolent ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and that these were increasingly realistic. However, what has always been clear, without benefit of hindsight, is that a pre-emptive strike against a presumed intention to make war is illegal under international law. </p> <p>For The Observer of all newspapers to support such aggression is deeply saddening.<br> <b>Russell Woodrow<br> London SE21 </b></p> <p>Tony Blair persistently argues that, even in the absence of weapons of mass destruction, the attack on Saddam Hussein was fully justified because the world is better off with the Iraqi leader in prison rather than in power. But before the 2003 invasion, the Prime Minister was singing a very different tune. 'I detest his regime. But even now he can save it by complying with the UN's demand. Even now we are prepared to go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully.'

  "British troops are poised to deploy to two violent flash-points south of Baghdad that have seen regular terrorist attacks as well as heavy street fighting, in a move certain to entangle Britain more deeply in Iraq's growing violence. <p>Senior US military officers in Baghdad have asked for a battalion of British soldiers - around 650 men, almost certainly from the Black Watch - to be moved to the holy city of Najaf, where just weeks ago US troops were engaged in a month of street-fighting with Shia radicals. </p> <p>While the majority of the soldiers would move into the US base just outside the city, more controversial is a request to deploy a company of British soldiers to Hilla, north of Najaf, and on the road to the rebel-controlled towns to the south of Baghdad. </p> <p>The movement of the Black Watch from Basra is intended to free up US troops to join the long-awaited battle to retake Falluja, and clear it of terrorists loyal to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>The proposed redeployment would almost certainly put the British troops under US command. Senior opposition figures last night demanded assurances that a British chain of command be retained. </p> <p>The disclosure comes as Nicholas Soames, the Tory shadow defence secretary, warned Tony Blair yesterday not to put troops in danger merely as a 'political gesture' to the US administration. </p> <p>His calls were echoed by former senior servicemen and by former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who said British troops could find themselves associated with the US's more aggressive tactics. </p> <p>'For a year, Britain has been trying in vain to persuade US forces to show the same restraint as our troops, who have won a lot of local goodwill as a result,' Cook said yesterday. </p> <p>'The real risk of sending a British battalion into the US sector is that our troops could become associated in Iraqi minds with US methods.' </p> <p>Further pressure on Blair over the conduct of the war comes in an interview today with Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, for ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby Programme. Annan says he does not believe the removal of Saddam Hussein has made the world a safer place. </p> <p>'I cannot say the world is safer,' said Annan, 'when you consider the violence around us, when you look around and see the attacks around the world. And you see what is going on in Iraq. </p> <p>'I think it has become more difficult in that you are getting a concentration of terrorists in Iraq, almost like a magnet drawing them there, and linking them to other groups outside Iraq.' </p> <p>The threatened US move against Falluja, which has followed days of bombing raids on rebel positions inside the city, stems from a determination in both Washington and London either to force the negotiated surrender of the insurgents there - and the handover of Zarqawi and his foreign fighters - or defeat them on the ground. </p> <p>It is part of an aggressive new policy designed to defeat the Sunni uprising ahead of next January's planned elections and imposition of government control in Falluja, Ramadi and Baquba by Iraq's own police and security forces by December at the latest. </p> <p>Political leaders in Washington and London have been emboldened by the US's rapid success in regaining control of Samarra after an assault lasting a few days, and by the agreement of radical Shia leader Moqtada al-Sadr to join the political process. </p> <p>The result has been weeks of discreet negotiations with tribal and political leaders in the Sunni Triangle and an attempt to persuade them to build a political platform. </p> <p>Under the American plan, a light brigade of US troops, plus perhaps as many again Iraqis, would be used to storm insurgent positions in the city of 300,000, which has become a symbol of resistance to the US-led forces and the interim government of Ayad Allawi. </p> <p>Any attempt to retake Falluja, however, is likely to be an extremely messy affair that risks high civilian casualties and a repeat of the widespread anger across Iraq during the last assault on the city in the spring. </p> <p>Last week, Ghazi al-Yawar, the Iraqi president and a Sunni, warned of the consequences of an assault on Falluja. 'We learn one thing in Iraq: that blood causes more blood,' Yawar said. 'It will send ripples as far as Mosul, which has the biggest Sunni population, three million-plus, which is living in a very tense situation right now.' </p> <p>The new strategy has emerged in tandem with diplomatic efforts to try to strangle the flow of money and personnel through Syria from former senior Baathists, including Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed, who was named to The Observer by Western intelligence as one of the key organisers of the insurgency. </p> <p>The redeployment of British troops to such a potentially explosive area is raising questions both over the creeping nature of Britain's involvement in Iraq and the risk of overstretch. </p> <p>Speaking on Radio 4 yesterday, Soames said that British forces should not be sent simply as a gesture to Washington ahead of the presidential elections. </p> <p>'We need to watch the timing and be careful that this isn't being used as a kind of political gesture to reassure the Americans of Tony Blair's support for the American efforts.' </p> <p>Soames's comments were echoed by Lib Dem defence spokesman Paul Keetch, who joined him in calling for a statement: 'We should be told the exact role and responsibilities that they will be asking our troops to perform and precisely where the direct authority for them will lie.'</p>",
  "<p>Big may be beautiful but small has been profitable, at least for much of the last five years. </p> <p>Over that period, the FTSE Small-cap index has fallen about 3 per cent - hardly a stellar performance but significantly better than the big boys of the FTSE 100 index, which is down by about a quarter. </p> <p>The performance over the 18 months or so since the markets bottomed has been particularly impressive, with the tiddlers up almost two-thirds compared with the 40 per cent rise in the FTSE 100. </p> <p>But there are now some signs that the small-cap surge could be running out of steam. Over the last three months, the FTSE 100 has rallied strongly - and not before time - and many pundits expect it to regain some of the ground it has lost over the last five years. </p> <p>There is certainly far less of a discrepancy between small and large companies than there has been for some time: the price-earnings ratio on the FTSE 100 index, a key measure of value for investors, is now below that of the small cap, while the average yield on the grown-up index, at 3 per cent, is higher than the 2.1 per cent for the tiddlers. </p> <p>Some would say that small companies deserve a premium: after all, they should be growing faster, both on the mathematical argument that it is easier to add 10 per cent to \u00a31 million of sales than to \u00a310 billion and because many are in faster-growing areas. But that assumes all small companies are go-go growth stocks; they are not - many of them are shrinking, not growing, and even those that are in attractive niches carry a big risk of failure. </p> <p>They are much more vulnerable to unexpected shocks like a customer going bust or a new product failing to live up to expectations, and often lack the depth of management that larger companies should have. Investors traditionally pay a premium for the security of size. </p> <p>Small companies also tend to do best when economies are recovering. The small-cap index is much more exposed to economically sensitive sectors such as housebuilding, engineering or technology while defensive industries like banking, pharmaceuticals and telecoms dominate the FTSE 100. Now that growth is slowing, the outperformance will be harder to come by. </p> <p>Frank Manduca, who manages the top-performing UBS UK Smaller Companies fund - up an impressive 28 per cent over the last year - admits that 'the relative opportunity window for smaller companies has narrowed following the strong rally in 2003'. But, he adds, it is not all doom and gloom: 'Some positive signs have already started to appear in the small-cap market, sales growth is emerging and should be a driver for company earnings going forward. The cash positions of certain companies remain strong and dividend growth continues to be a positive, too.' He is particularly enthusiastic about the resources sector - Cairn Energy produced one of the spectacular successes of the decade when it soared into the FTSE 100 on the back of discoveries in the Rajasthan basin in India - and technology companies. </p> <p>Steven Grant, who runs the smaller companies trust for F&amp;C Management, says careful stock-picking is now essential in the small-cap sector. 'If you go back a year ago, stock-picking was an impediment to performance; things were going up indiscriminately. Since then, there has been a realisation that the world has become more difficult, with higher oil prices and rising interest rates.' </p> <p>He is looking for cash-generative companies 'with the depth of management and the infrastructure to allow them to grow profitably against a challenging background'. There are far too few of these, he says, big or small. He cites Glenmorangie, the whisky company that has just put itself up for sale, and oil company Paladin Resources as two good examples. However, private investors should not try stock-picking for themselves unless they have a very large portfolio; the risk of investing in a few small companies is too great. </p> <p>Instead, they should consider a fund. UBS's is well-regarded, as are those from Framlington and Artemis.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to believe Farnley Hey was built only a few years after the Second World War. Set on a wooded hillside near Holmfirth in West Yorkshire, the house is a striking example of a style of architecture more often associated with California than a part of the country best known for Last of the Summer Wine. But that isn't the only reason it's unique. Inside as well as out, it's been maintained with the same spirit of modernism as when it was built, from the Formica kitchen units to the period Scandinavian furniture. 'We haven't changed much really,' says its owner, Joe Battye. 'But we don't call it a museum. It's our home.'</p> <p>Designed in 1953 by British architect Peter Womersley as a wedding present for his brother, Farnley Hey was awarded a RIBA Bronze Medal in 1957 and was one of the first post-war private houses to be Grade II listed. At the time, the flat-roofed, wood and stone exterior with its floor-to-ceiling picture windows proved a radical departure, and the creation of open-plan spaces in favour of distinct rooms meant a new kind of living experience. </p> <p>Joe and Jean Battye bought Farnley Hey from the Womersleys in 1959. When they came to see the house there was a viewing fee of \u00a32 - the equivalent of \u00a330 today - to sift out serious buyers from the merely curious. To begin with, Jean, who died earlier this year, had her doubts. 'She said she didn't want to live in a goldfish bowl,' chuckles Joe Battye. 'But then we came to look, and I could see by her face. We bought it quicker than some people buy a hat. And it was one of the best moves we ever made.'</p> <p>There's a tremendous impression of space about the house. The living room is double-height, with wooden panelling and a plain brick wall, and a polished wood and stone floor. Open-plan stairs lead to a first-floor mezzanine balcony, while another set drops down to the lower-level dining room, separated from the kitchen by a built-in cupboard unit. </p> <p>But it's the windows that form Farnley Hey's most striking feature. With heat-reflective curtains made from an aluminium fabric developed for the space programme, they allow uninterrupted views over the wooded gardens and Pennine countryside beyond. One of the few structural changes the Battyes made was to maximise the dramatic setting even more, enclosing an external balcony off the mezzanine floor and replacing its wood-panelled wall with a single pane of plate glass. 'It's like having a constantly changing picture,' Battye says. </p> <p>In the living room, Battye slides back a panel in a leatherette shelf unit to reveal a built-in radio that's pure Fifties, fitting in with the colour scheme of natural greens and browns. Formica is also very much in evidence, from the hand-made wardrobes in the bedroom to the units in the living and dining areas. 'But it's like no Formica you've ever seen before. Go on, feel it,' urges Battye. He's right - instead of the smoothness you would expect, the surface has a hessian-like texture. </p> <p>Few anachronisms from later decades have been allowed to disturb the contemporary aesthetic. Most of the furniture was bought when the Battyes first moved in. Mainly Scandinavian, it not only complements the house but is itself now highly collectable. Battye has been approached by museums keen to acquire the plum pieces, such as the Eames chair and rare wooden-legged chairs by Arne Jacobsen.</p> <p>But Farnley Hey is not just a time capsule. A self-confessed technophile, Battye has always been keen to keep the house up to date. Back in 1963 he installed one of the UK's first microwave ovens. Bought half-price from Harrods for \u00a3600, it took two men to lift it. The house is now fully automated, with a touch- panel control operating everything from the curtains to the heated drive. </p> <p>After living here for more than 40 years, it's clear he sees himself more as Farnley Hey's custodian than its owner. Now in his eighties, there's a sense he's preparing to pass on the torch. The house will remain in the family, as his son will eventually inherit and come to live here. 'He'll be taking over from me,' Battye says, with some satisfaction. In the meantime, he regards it as his responsibility to ensure that Farnley Hey is prepared for its next half-century. 'Everything's been brought up to the same standard as when it was built. This house was contemporary then. And it's contemporary now.'</p>",
  "<p>It's a task that would cow Hercules and a mission that has eluded world leaders.

Second is tackling malnutrition. Third is preventing malaria and fourth liberalising trade. </p> <p>Next on the list are another five solutions judged 'good' value for money and four judged 'fair'. Most divisive, though, will be the four solutions judged 'bad' value for money - including policies on global warming and climate change. </p> <p>Expanding access to education didn't even make the list - not because it's a bad idea but because the experts were uncertain of its success. </p> <p>The Copenhagen Consensus project was set up by Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg, author of the controversial The Skeptical Environmentalist, which claimed many green policies - especially on climate change - were misguided. </p> <p>This week Lomborg is in London to mount a public defence of his latest project - and the book that goes with it, Global Crises, Global Solutions - at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts. </p> <p>Lomborg has been criticised for demanding that governments make 'false choices' between vastly contrasting solutions, such as mosquito nets, water pumps and carbon taxes. He told The Observer that politicians always made such choices and that his project aimed to give them more evidence to make better decisions.</p> <p>'I understand the sentiment: the point is - and these are approximate numbers - the benefit to cost ratio of doing something like HIV/Aids [prevention] is something like 40 to one. If you do something like local health services it was four to one. </p> <p>'If you spend a certain amount of money do you want to see 10 times as many people [helped] or just one?' </p> <p>The Copenhagen Consensus narrowed down a list of 32 global problems to the 10 biggest threats. </p> <p>Some were high-profile issues such as climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, malnutrition and hunger, migration and sanitation and access to clean water. Others were less visible: education, financial instability, governance and corruption, and subsidies and trade barriers. </p> <p>Lomborg asked three economists in each field to prepare expert papers and got eight of the world's top economists - including several Nobel Laureates - to rank suggested solutions according to cost and benefit. </p> <p><strong>A brighter future</strong><br> 10 things on the priority list</p> <p>1. Control HIV/Aids - primarily through prevention such as free condoms and sex education. </p> <p>2. Tackle malnutrition by providing supplements with micro-nutrients. </p> <p>3. Liberalise world trade by persuading countries to open their markets </p> <p>4. Control malaria by using insecticide-permeated nets to protect people and targeting pregnant women. </p> <p>5. Use new agricultural technology such as improved seed varieties and farming practices for bigger and more reliable crops. </p> <p>6. Encourage community-managed water supply and sanitation schemes to reduce the totals of 1.1m people with unsafe water and 2.4m with bad sanitation. </p> <p>7. Use small-scale water technology - low-cost electric or diesel pumps, natural irrigation and rain-harvesting - in order to give help to farmers. </p> <p>8. Lower barriers to migration for skilled workers. </p> <p>9. Improve both infant and child nutrition. </p> <p>10. Introduce 'optimal' carbon tax of US$150-600 per tonne aimed at reducing global carbon emissions by about half.</p>",
  "Six weeks ago, The Observer asked six people just starting out at very different points in the world of education to record their hopes and fears in personal journals. As the autumn term progresses, we hear how some are having the best time of their lives, while for others the past few weeks have brought upset, stress, strains - and, for one, the threat of a court case. <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b>Anna Whicher</b>, 18, a former pupil of the private Badminton School, has started at Reading University after failing to get the A-level grades she needed to study French and history at Warwick. </p> <p>After being so horribly disappointed not to get a place at Warwick and feeling I was coming to Reading on sufferance, the moment I walked into Wantage Hall, I knew this was the right place to be. </p> <p>I thought I must have strayed into an Oxford college: Wantage is like something out of Harry Potter. The dining room looks like the great hall at Hogwarts, with long wooden tables and portraits on the walls. It has some bizarre traditions, such as letting sheep into the court once a year. </p> <p>Reading was my 'insurance offer', so I only had temporary accommodation. It was torturous not knowing whether I could stay in the hall, but I made friends with the other temporary students who were in the same boat and kept my fingers crossed. My corridor is mixed, so when I walk out of the shower, there are men everywhere, which is a culture shock. </p> <p>I know it's a clich\u00e9 but freshers week has been one of the best weeks of my life. I am missing my best friends, Lucy and Ed, but I've averaged four hours' sleep a night thanks to an endless stream of drinking, meeting new people and having so much fun. </p> <p>The atmosphere is incredible: we have quiz nights, drinking competitions and speed dating. When we get home in the early hours, quiet snacks in the kitchen degenerate into food fights involving the whole corridor, with chairs as barricades and food, shaving cream and water as ammunition. </p> <p>I was told last week that a room had become available in Wantage if I would be prepared to share a room. I would, so that's wonderful. </p> <p>Budgeting is another preoccupation. I'm spending way over my set amount for socialising and drinking, but once I'm fully into the course I expect that will slow down. </p> <p>Lectures started last week, and they have been fascinating, but I have been given work like there is no tomorrow. It's getting a bit hectic trying to balance everything but it's all part of the game. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b>Azim Ansari</b> was 14 when he and his brother smuggled themselves into Britain from Afghanistan in 2001. They have not heard from their parents, four brothers and two sisters since. Azim achieved 'A' grades in A-level maths and physics and a B in computing this year. He has just started at St John's College, Oxford, where he is studying engineering. The Home Office, however, has rejected his application to stay in the UK, and the brothers' first appeal takes place next week. </p> <p>My brother Wali and I have our first Immigration Service hearing on Thursday to decide if we must return to Afghanistan. </p> <p>Since I came to Oxford, we have had to get a new lawyer. Our old solicitor was too far away for us to visit regularly. The upshot is that we have had to tell our story again. </p> <p>It's hard for me. I'm trying to start a new life in Oxford, and having to retell it reminds me how uncertain my life is and that I don't know if it will ever be secure. </p> <p>I watch the students around me going out and having a good time, and I don't know if I even have it in me to behave like that now; I have too much on my mind to let go. If I tried, I think I would feel too guilty because my family made so many sacrifices to get me here, and now I don't even know where they are. </p> <p>Our new solicitor is on holiday so my brother and I will represent ourselves. Usually they send a barrister but we can't afford the \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 that would cost. </p> <p>I hope it won't be too difficult to explain our case, but the thought of it has made it hard to concentrate and get enthusiastic about university. When you're unsure what will happen, it makes you not want to work, which is awful because I've come to university to work hard; that's the whole point of my family's sacrifice. </p> <p>In every other way, my life is good. If only I could enjoy it. My girlfriend, Becky, and I have been given a lovely flat near the college, Becky has found a job, I am enjoying my lectures, and Oxford is a great place. The people are lovely and there are parks and museums and the river. I would really love to stay. </p> <p>We are asking people to sign a petition to help us at <a href=\"http://www.asylumbristol.org.uk\">www.asylumbristol.org.uk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ncadc.org.uk/archives/filed%20newszines/newszine50/waliazim.html\">www.ncadc.org.uk/archives/filed%20newszines/newszine50/waliazim.html</a> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b>Richard Killip</b>, 18, from Bradford, was the first member of his family to take A-levels, let alone go to university. Yet he has gone to Cambridge to study politics, law and environmental studies. </p> <p>My stepmum started joking before I left home that if I came back during the holidays talking posh, there would be trouble. </p> <p>I think this revealed a fear because none of my family has any understanding of universities or of the student way of life. They worry they won't be able to make conversation with me when I come back. </p> <p>I have never wanted university to change me - I was determined to keep my accent, for example - but my stepmum's comment made me realise it could happen, and I'm even more determined now to ensure that it doesn't. </p> <p>Even so, I've made such good friends here so quickly that I go through periods where I completely forget my friends at home. It's worrying how easily I can forget people. Queens' College has started to feel like home after just a few weeks. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that Queens is such an insular place. My lectures take place within 250 yards of my rooms and the college has so many facilities, I rarely have to leave the grounds. There is a real chance that I will absorb the culture without realising it, and I will have to make sure that doesn't happen. </p> <p>Before I arrived, the thought of living with people who had had everything given to them with a silver spoon, both in terms of education and life chances, really worried me. I was concerned I would be looked down on because I would be far behind the private school kids in terms of extra-curricular education and because I didn't have the chance to prepare myself for life here. Because no one from Bradford College had been to Oxbridge in 30 years, I had to focus entirely on simply getting myself here, so I was worried that students from the [private] schools would have had far more time to do all sorts of background preparation. </p> <p>I anticipated I would only really make friends with state school people and there would be two distinct groups. But it doesn't matter to anyone where we went to school. There are some very posh people here but in general, we all just get on together. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> <b>Diana Shepherd</b> has been brought in as head of Craven Park, a community primary school in the east London borough of Hackney, which had been put into special measures and earmarked for closure. After a protest by parents last May, the local education authority agreed to relaunch it with a new head and extra funding. Shepherd has a year to improve Craven Park: next year a new, permanent head will be brought in. </p> <p>I have said that the children in this school can achieve as well as those anywhere in the country. There is a feeling that traumatic things have happened here, that this is a school with scars that are only beginning to heal and that one reason it was failing was that too few people believe in it. </p> <p>But I am rigorous in my demand that everyone, from the cleaners to the parents to the teachers, has the highest expectation of themselves, this school and its students, and that they act to make those expectations a reality. </p> <p>I have started a continuous programme of Ofsted-like inspections of my classes. I am Ofsted trained, so I sit in and judge the quality of the teaching. It's difficult for the teachers but they will have to get used to it: if their lessons are satisfactory, I will only repeat the inspection twice a term. If they continue to fail, I will act, both to support and to challenge them. </p> <p>I have to be delicate, though. I have set up a support system so teachers don't feel undermined, and understand that it's not a personal criticism but an opportunity for professional development. </p> <p>I am already experiencing problems, however. One teacher is finding the changes quite hard going. We've offered her additional support but she's proving resistant. </p> <p>It's the same with parents. They say to me all the time that I'm new and I don't understand how things were. </p> <p>I'm starting with immediate, smaller changes that will have an obvious impact, to give people confidence in me. Lunchtimes are chaotic, which is going to change, and the back gate is going to be locked so all late children come past the reception area. There are a lot of them now, which is disrupts lessons. </p> <p>A mother told me last week that her 10-year-old daughter was being bullied. I had to admit we didn't have an active anti-bullying programme, although work was going into developing one. </p> <p>The mother reported it to governors. It was awkward, but par for the course as I strive to improve the school. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> <b>Jon Hanna</b>, 24, started his first job this term as a qualified history and religious education teacher at the Seacole Centre, a pilot project targeted at troubled GCSE students in Hackney. </p> <p>I've just seen one of the new TV teacher recruitment advertisements. A colleague was very upset because it pictures idyllic students who develop their opinions based on their school experience. </p> <p>It just isn't like that, and I'm glad: that would be boring. Our students have lots of challenging options and beliefs. They don't come to my lessons empty and need to fill up: they are not cars. It's more like they are coming to dinner and all bringing different foods, which I have to make into a suitable meal. </p> <p>It was great coming back to school [Hanna taught there before qualifying], but I'm already thinking I spend more time dealing with problems than actually teaching. For some students, coming to school is an alarming experience where they exchange a comfortable, loving environment for a chaotic, bustling, busy place where people forget their name and know little about them. </p> <p>Yet for the really unlucky ones, school is a longed-for escape from a difficult and oppressive home existence. They need us most. </p> <p>I met an old friend from university last week, who now earns three times what I get, and has all his evenings and weekends to himself. </p> <p>I felt jealous at first and wondered if I'd made a massive mistake. Then I wondered if he really has as much fun at work as me, whether his 'clients' crack him up quite as much as my students do me. I doubt it. The good thing about teaching is that you are never bored. Stressed, yes, but bored? Definitely not. </p> <p>I've hit one big problem already, and don't know what to do. I've been trained to design our lessons for students of all abilities. But what should I be doing with those who can't read at all? </p> <p>The political chat now is all about inclusion, and it's right in principle. But is it right that we allow some students to go through school and leave without the most basic skills? </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> <b>Tom Widdows</b> is principal of the successful Bexley Business Academy, in south London, which recently hit the headlines by threatening to take Ofsted to court. </p> <p>Last month we became the first city academy to challenge Ofsted over a finding of 'significant weaknesses' in teaching. Schools are not officially allowed to question its judgment, but encouraged to push the boundaries. To us that means rejecting an irrational, inconsistent and preposterous report. </p> <p>We were so outraged by the findings of the inspectors, who interfered in the way we teach, that we instructed Queen's Counsel. Ofsted eventually withdrew the report, replacing it with a less formal monitoring letter. </p> <p>Ofsted's persistence in standing by its findings without first addressing our formal complaint, which challenged the way those findings were arrived at, raised many questions about the appropriateness of an organisation that is self-regulatory. </p> <p>We have now received a response, which requires a further response from us, and so it goes on... </p> <p>So it was a difficult end to last term and, even though we won our point, I feel angry about the amount of time and energy the school has been forced to spend on getting Ofsted to simply listen to our case. Our job is to teach children, not get into these arguments. Strangely, the whole idiotic affair energised us; we came back at the beginning of this term more unified, determined and positive than ever. </p> <p>We're fortunate that financially we can fight Ofsted, but I am even more fortunate to be surrounded by an innovative governing body and supportive parents who are brave enough to fight. Often governing bodies feel intimidated by Ofsted, but we felt we had to state our case because the transformation we have witnessed in our students has been astounding. Only two students obtained five A* to C GCSE passes in the final year of Thamesmead Community College, the failing school we replaced. </p> <p>We achieved 35 per cent this year and with all our students getting at least one GCSE we are in the top five per cent of schools nationally. At Thamesmead, the exclusion rate was more than 20 a year. We have excluded only five students in the last year. Attendance is up from 70 per cent to 90 per cent. </p> <p>Our idea of long school days is working brilliantly: we have more than 100 children coming in at 7am. They have breakfast, use the computers and do homework. </p> <p>The really big thing for me is that the school is open until 9pm and a lot of teachers work late to do their work, so many students see them as role models. I see classrooms of teachers and students sitting quietly together, doing separate work. </p> <p>I found that quite emotional. It proves we're instilling a feeling in students that learning is something they really want to do.</p>",
  "They are the women who decide what you will be reading next year, and they dominate British publishing. Handing over advances of tens of thousands of pounds and bidding for books in hundreds of thousands, this handful of female players control the fate of the British book industry. <p>But 'sisterhood', it seems, is not always the right word to describe this tight network of top businesswomen. Tensions between at least three of the most influential women in publishing have reached breaking point this autumn. </p> <p>At the centre of what promises to develop into a split inside one of the country's largest publishing houses are Caroline Michel, the glamorous managing director of HarperPress, a literary paperback division; Amanda Ridout, the capable managing director of the company's Books Group; and Victoria Barnsley, its powerful chief executive. </p> <p>Michel, who has close friendships with a host of influential creative personalities - from Salman Rushdie and Greg Dyke to Ruth Rogers and Jeanette Winterson - and who is the wife of Labour peer Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, was brought into HarperCollins by Barnsley in a high-profile move to reinvigorate the company's list of paperback authors. But her copybook has been blotted by a series of unlucky and costly deals. </p> <p>Her loyal purchase of Winterson's new book has not yet been rewarded with the hoped-for sales, while her high bids for the memoirs of broadcasters Dyke and Jon Snow are also looking unwise. The two books, while creating a stir, have failed to perform well in the bookshops. Both the manuscripts were allegedly purchased for six-figure sums and, while the Dyke book at least has recouped part of this amount in newspaper serialisation fees, neither book is now seen to have justified the initial outlay. </p> <p>'There is a sense that things are a little out of control,' said a leading literary agent this weekend, 'The damaging idea going round is that Victoria Barnsley is slightly disengaged from what is going on.' </p> <p>This year also saw the closing down of an entire HarperCollins imprint, the formerly acclaimed Flamingo, a list of writerly paperback titles. Continued pressure to protect the company's bottom line is leading to friction among these former allies in a man's world. </p> <p>'Bringing in Caroline Michel was a brave experiment. Has it worked? No,' said one commissioning editor. 'It is the kind of run of bad luck or bad judgment that allows a certain type of man in the industry to complain there is too much oestrogen around.' </p> <p>Barnsley, who started up her own publishing company, Fourth Estate, from one room in Notting Hill in 1984, has prided herself on promoting women and is believed to have wanted to buy into Michel's established talent for dealing with writers and promoting new projects. But among those who are thought to have been wary about her appointment was Barnsley's other senior lieutenant, Ridout, who insisted that Michel should report directly to her. </p> <p>Michel and Ridout are now regarded by colleagues as polar opposites in style. 'There has always been a feeling that Amanda Ridout is very strong on a certain kind of commercial book,' said an ex-colleague. 'She has a knack of spotting a winning property. Michel on the other hand, is fantastically wealthy and glamorous, but not so confident when it comes to editorial sensibility. Paying out \u00a3600,000 or something like it for both Dyke and Snow's books was suicidal. What she is good at is people.' </p> <p>When Michel was poached from Vintage Books she had earned a glowing reputation with a successful run of novels. Working there, she reported to one of the other queen bees of British publishing, Gail Rebuck, the chief executive and chairman of the Random House Group. Married to one of the architects of New Labour, the pollster Philip Gould, Rebuck is an extremely powerful figure. She took on Michel from her role as the managing director of Granta and Random House staff speculate that she might be happy to welcome her back. </p> <p>Rebuck's success at Random House has been put down to her allowing the imprints within the group, such as Hutchinson and Jonathan Cape, to continue doing their own thing. This weekend another Rebuck duo of imprints, Chatto &amp; Windus and Vintage, have announced the purchase of the French novel that caused the biggest bidding tussle at this month's Frankfurt Book Fair, Suite Francais by Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky. </p> <p>At HarperCollins Michel's future may hangs on the success of HarperPerennial, a daring new catalogue of work from writers such as E Annie Proulx and J G Ballard. </p> <p>Whatever happens Barnsley, revealed this weekend as one of 10 shortlisted business people vying for the title of Business Leader of the Year Award, will also take a share of the blame or credit.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Seconds of Pleasure: Stories</strong><br>by Neil LaBute<br>Faber \u00a310.99, pp224</p> <p>Neil LaBute has never shied away from the darkest reaches of the psyche; instead, he's built a theatrical and cinematic career out of probing into the ways in which ordinary people - for the most part, men - can slip almost casually into violence and cruelty. Plays such as his off-Broadway success Bash: latterday plays, with Calista Flockhart, or In The Company of Men, which he then directed as his first feature film, explored the union between sex and brutality, intimacy and cruelty, with a candour that has disturbed audiences and critics.</p> <p>Little surprise, then, that his first collection of prose fiction uncovers those same hidden places and exposes aspects of human nature that most of us would rather not confront. No surprise, either, that LaBute has an intuitive ear for character and voice, a surgical eye for detail and a dramatic sense of how to effect the kind of twist that can make the reader physically gasp. In fact, the only curiosity is that he's waited until the age of 41 to publish his first book.</p> <p>Almost without exception, these 20 stories, some lasting no longer than a page and a half, deal with sexual desire. More specifically, they deal with all the darker business that circles around it: regret, betrayal, humiliation, lies, suspicion, jealousy, frustration, bitterness. Pleasure, if achieved at all, is as fleeting as the title implies; the fall-out lasts far longer than the desire or its fulfillment.</p> <p>For the most part, the men come out looking fairly shabby; beneath the thinnest lacquer of respectability, they seethe with a lust that is rapacious, opportunistic, often vicious and entirely stripped of affection. Those who are technically innocent of any misdemeanour, such as the protagonist of 'Layover', who flirts with a woman at an airport fast-food counter before rejoining his wife and children, and those whose actions transgress all established boundaries - the narrator of 'Ravishing' who describes the shooting of his first snuff movie - are presented as merely points along the same scale; in between lie all the family men (and women) who have ever cheated, all the middle-aged men who have lusted after young girls, all those who have toyed with people, been toyed with, and wanted revenge.</p> <p>It is significant that very few of the characters have proper names. This both depersonalises them and reinforces the sense that all sexual encounters are a playing out of tired roles, but it also gives the author the opportunity to upend the reader's expectations to shocking effect. In 'Time Share', the trajectory seems predictable until you realise that convention has led you to ascribe the wrong gender roles throughout; 'A Second of Pleasure' is written entirely in unattributed dialogue, requiring the reader to scrutinise it for clues as to who is making which side of the argument.</p> <p>The strongest narrative voices here are sharp, staccato and vernacular, rooted in the rhythms of conversation, marbled with a dark humour that often seems effortless: 'It had started off well enough, with a nice call from his mother - well, not nice, exactly, but short.' In fact, he only loses momentum when he attempts more conventional prose; his writing is so emphatic when spare and unadorned that any attempt at a baroque flourish draws attention to itself for the wrong reasons.</p> <p>Some women will find these snapshots of male desire unsettling; presumably many men would fiercely deny the truth, or at least the universality, of his portraits. But most of the characters here are not extreme; they have jobs, friends, children, they go to church. They could, he seems to suggest, be any of us.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Plot Against America</strong><br>by Philip Roth<br>Cape \u00a316.99, pp391</p> <p>In the series of novels which has built his colossal late reputation, Philip Roth has examined the traumas of the last half-century of American life: McCarthyism in I Married A Communist, the upheavals of the Sixties in American Pastoral, political correctness in The Human Stain. It's logical that having squeezed all the available juice out of history, he has gone on to invent a convulsion of his own: the election of Charles Lindbergh to the White House in 1940 on an anti-war ticket.</p> <p>It's a canny choice of might-have-been, an unseen hinge around which the world might have swung into disaster. Lindbergh was young (born in 1902), a world-famous hero of aviation and a fascist sympathiser who in October 1938 accepted from G\u00f6ring the Service Cross of the German Eagle for services to the Reich. Roth examines the effects of the new administration on a Jewish family to which he gives the name of his own, in his own home town, Newark, New Jersey.</p> <p>Altered-history plots may have their roots in science fiction (Keith Roberts's Pavane, Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle), but they can crop up pretty much anywhere, on the bestseller lists (Robert Harris's Fatherland) and even prime-time television. To jazz up a fading formula, the writers of Friends set episodes in an alternative universe, where the shocking changes were on the level of personal history and fat distribution rather than changes of government, but the principle was the same.</p> <p>In the ambitious form chosen by Roth, though, the relationship between foreground and background is likely to be problematic, and there are real difficulties to be finessed. The moment he attaches the phrase 'as everyone knows' to something that is necessarily unfamiliar - because he has just made it up - he risks an implosion of plausibility. The alternatives are to present the background material obliquely, as if he was indeed only reminding his readers of things they already knew, or to spell out exactly how his world diverges from ours.</p> <p>His chosen method is this second one, with the result that The Plot Against America itself diverges in construction and emphasis from what it claims to be, a memoir from a parallel present. A real memoir wouldn't need to rehash (or, strictly speaking, hash) the headlines, since 'everyone' would indeed know them.</p> <p>A third-person narrative can give some of the force of a documentary, while a first-person story works rather as a pinhole camera. In his recent work Philip Roth has favoured the staging of struggles however epic within the family, but by telling this story from the point of view of 'Philip', who shares his birth date, Roth stacks the odds against himself. Philip may be precocious and have an inkling of various adult mysteries, but he is nevertheless only seven when Lindbergh declares his candidacy, still nine when his family is threatened with relocation to Kentucky.</p> <p>The eyes of a boy so young aren't the most obvious apertures for showing us the fracturing landscape of his alter native Forties. In practice, Roth cheats, reporting for instance a conversation Philip's father Herman has with a projectionist friend about emigrating to Canada before Philip himself hears an edited version of it.</p> <p>In a period when much fiction seems microwaved, Roth's preference in his great recent novels has been for an older technology, the pressure cooker. Steely plots seal in the characters so that the low flame of history - what in this book he calls 'the relentless unforeseen' - can fiercely render down their most desperate essences.</p> <p>He works the trick again in The Plot Against America for more than 100 pages. No one is better at showing how people's temperaments go out to meet their disasters. Philip's parents are gentle people, but Old World mistrust of gentile arrangements underlies their American optimism. The Roths' milieu may be Jewish, but hardly observant. Even local households which keep kosher, such as theirs, do so more out of habit than principle. Growing suspicion of the government of America isn't counterbalanced by any expectations of the God of Israel. Philip isn't the only one to consider Walter Winchell, the broadcaster and columnist who speaks out fiercely against the new regime, 'an out-and-out god and more important by far than Adonoy'.</p> <p>Philip's paternal uncle Monty is a brutally realistic businessman with underworld contacts, while his maternal aunt Evelyn is a theatrical creature who becomes involved with a widowed and worldly rabbi anxious to play a part in the new administration.</p> <p>The family struggles chiefly concern two young people, Philip's orphan cousin Alvin, who runs off to Canada to fight against the Germans, and his older brother Sandy, who takes part in a government programme to broaden the horizons of Jewish children (or, more sinisterly, to estrange them from their parents), and becomes its local figurehead.</p> <p>Then, just when the ingredients are beginning to bubble nicely, Roth throws in an FBI man stopping Philip on the street and asking questions. The power of the fiction was greater before this point, when a culture and a sense of entitlement were palpably melting away even without direct intervention from the state. The later part of the book is marked by some forcing of incident (a climactic scene of violence within the family seems thinly motivated) and then a strange abdication from the drama.</p> <p>The Lindbergh threat simply goes away. His plane disappears, and history rectifies itself. In due course Einstein gets to be the first Jew on an American stamp, Bobby Kennedy gets to be assassinated. At the page 300 mark, Roth devotes 20 pages to describing extracts from newsreels - which 'Philip Roth', as we know from an earlier attempt which ended badly, is too young to be allowed in to see.</p> <p>It's a curious fizzling of a bold enterprise. There seems no need, in this genre of fiction, to return to the starting point, no advantage to be gained by doing so. Once people's hidden hatreds are legitimised by the authorities, anything can happen. Isn't that the whole point?</p> <p>It's the novelist's job to follow his speculations to their furthest point - hardly a task that Roth has shirked in the past. It almost amounts to a retraction, to an acknowledgement that American history as we have known it has some magnetic integrity, so that his imagination can wrench it out of true only on a temporary basis. This is scarcely likely to be what Roth thinks, or he would hardly have bothered to write the novels which showed America, like the family, to be a constant, seething, undeclared civil war.</p> <p>Perhaps he was bored with being criticised for the extremity of his vision, and wanted the refreshment of hearing that he had sold his ideas short.</p>"
