  "<p>Arsenal will be glad Ars\u00e8ne Wenger does not take other people's comments to heart because he might otherwise be tempted to quit if - or most likely when - Patrick Vieira departs. </p> <p>No sooner had Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 described Vieira as \"40%\" of Arsenal's team than the former Highbury captain Frank McLintock said it would be \"almost impossible\" to find a replacement of similar quality. What Wenger will not need telling is that Vieira's sale would deprive him of far more than a great footballer. </p> <p>Vieira has been not just a top-quality player for Arsenal but their captain, leader and a symbol of the club's status as one of Europe's most highly regarded teams. Opponents are bound to take succour from the midfielder's absence. Whether Arsenal would be less successful is another matter. Wenger will recall his team were written off last summer and ended as unbeaten champions. </p> <p>Plugging a gap left by Vieira looks especially tough, though, because the 28-year-old contributes to every aspect of Arsenal's play. On top of his defensive qualities lies a capacity to spark the blistering counter-attacks that make the side so dangerous. His value in defending set plays at 6ft 4in should not be overlooked, and there is more besides. </p> <p>\"He has composure that seems to spread through the team,\" says Paul Davis, a former Arsenal midfielder. \"He has grown to be more in control of his game, more authoritative in his play and more of a leader. His drive has taken Arsenal through on a lot of occasions; he can pick a team up when they are down. </p> <p>\"I believe he'd be better off staying at Arsenal and finishing off the job by becoming the first Arsenal captain to lift the European Cup, but Arsenal have done well without him in the side. It's not a one-man team, even if he is a big player.\" </p> <p>Arsenal's 5-1 win at Internazionale last season came in Vieira's absence and they also beat Liverpool and Chelsea in identical circumstances. Yet Wenger has never really experienced life at Highbury without his compatriot. Vieira made his debut for the club, in September 1996, 12 days before the manager officially took over. Only injuries and suspensions have since kept him out of the side. He has that blend of mental and physical toughness that Wenger regards so highly. </p> <p>\"The important question would be how the other players react,\" says Terry Neill, a former Arsenal manager. \"Whether they go down the road of 'Oh no, we've lost Patrick Vieira' or step up and take a bit more responsibility and go up in terms of stature and performance.\" Wenger, too, would need to react well. \"The job of management is to replace and continue things,\" Neill says, \"much as the old Liverpool teams always did.\" </p> <p>It would be hard to see how Wenger could avoid purchasing a central midfielder to replace Vieira. Ray Parlour's move has left Gilberto Silva and Edu as the only experienced players in that position. Mathieu Flamini, 20, has just arrived from France and Cesc F\u00e1bregas is only 17. Arsenal are linked with the young Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano of River Plate. </p> <p>Though Lauren could come into his natural central midfield position if a right-back were purchased, opponents regard Vieira as effectively irreplaceable, judging by the views of Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 and Southampton's Matthew Oakley, who has gone toe to toe with the former Milan player. </p> <p>\"He's the complete midfielder,\" says Oakley. \"He breaks up attacks, protects their back four and then he's so useful with the ball at his feet that he changes defence into attack so quickly. Plus, he's the captain and leads by example. He seems to have this aura on the pitch where he totally controls their team. </p> <p>\"I don't think they could replace him. They'd basically be taking the main pin out of their side. Sol Campbell was strong last year and so was [Thierry] Henry, but if you ask the players I think the first name on the sheet would be Vieira.\" </p> <p>Oakley admires not only Vieira's talent but tactical nous. \"Say Sol Campbell gets pulled out of position and a forward's running through, he'll read that and make a tackle. He's got speed, his timing is good on his tackles and he's got such a long reach with his legs. You think you're away and he'll get back and toe it away. </p> <p>\"I also think it comes from Patrick the way Arsenal can break up an attack when you're throwing players forward and within four or five passes the ball's in your net. </p> <p>\"He's very aware of where players around him are and can turn away with both feet. He has the knack of finding Henry, who's clever at pulling wide.\" </p> <p>Vieira has been key to Wenger's whole system. It remains to be seen whether his departure would have any effect on the manager's future. Wenger gave the impression last season that he would certainly see the club into their new stadium in August 2006 but has since said he will decide in October whether to extend his contract beyond next summer. </p> <p>\"I think Wenger is the key to the whole thing, not the players,\" says Neill. \"He's the focal point, he's created the success.\" Vieira, too, has played a huge part. Wenger would face as stern a test as any he has confronted at Highbury to deliver trophies next season without him. </p> <p> <strong>Eight years' hard labour at Highbury</strong></p> <p><strong> 1996-97 </strong> Arrives at Highbury, according to urban legend, knowing only two words of English, one an obscenity and the other \"Tottenham\". Makes debut as substitute for Ray Parlour in a 4-1 home win against Sheffield Wednesday. Never returns to the bench but collects 11 yellow cards. Arsenal finish third. </p> <p><strong> 1997-98 </strong> Forms a Gallic midfield partnership with Emmanuel Petit and wins his first Premiership title aged 21. Plays in the 2-0 Cup final win over Newcastle that seals the club's second double. </p> <p><strong> 1998-99 </strong> Now a world champion, makes his Champions League debut but suffers an early exit, to be repeated every year until 2004. Arsenal finish second in the Premiership. </p> <p><strong> 1999-2000 </strong> United take the title by 18 points but he wins the European Championship in the Netherlands. </p> <p><strong> 2000-01 </strong> Two red cards in five days in August mean a five-game ban. Arsenal make the first of three Cup final appearances in a row, losing to Liverpool, and are second in the Premiership again. </p> <p><strong> 2001-02 </strong> Misses only three Premiership matches as the Gunners complete their third double, beating Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium. </p> <p><strong> 2002-03 </strong> Takes over the club captaincy from Tony Adams, having been Cannes' youngest ever captain at 19. Misses the Cup final win over Southampton through injury. </p> <p><strong> 2003-04 </strong> Reaches Champions League last eight, losing to Chelsea, and caps his 362nd club appearance with his 26th goal, the last one of Arsenal's unbeaten league season, against Leicester. He also scores in the draw that clinched the title for the Gunners - at White Hart Lane, funnily enough, in April.</p>",
  "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson's fate is unlikely to be sealed today despite an emergency board meeting this afternoon at an undisclosed central London location. </p> <p> The 12-man FA board will hear the findings of an inquiry into the circumstances that led to an erroneous denial of Eriksson's affair with Faria Alam being issued. But despite the desperate need to draw a line under this debilitating and embarrassing issue the bloodletting at Soho Square is unlikely to end.</p> <p> Last night the FA announced that regardless of the findings the board could ask for further evidence from any of the parties involved, a sign that the confusion at Soho Square is set to rumble on.</p> <p> In a statement the FA also said it had retained a second set of lawyers - Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw LLP - to advise it on \"matters arising\" from the report, a further indication that the inquiry is unlikely to provide the tidy conclusion to the affair the FA so desperately needs.</p> <p> After a fortnight in which too much has been said with too little thought, the board and the management team attempting to steer the FA to calmer waters are clearly determined to go by the book. \"It is the board's role to concentrate on the facts and ensure all of the correct processes and procedures are followed. This is clearly a detailed issue,\" the FA said. </p> <p>\"All decisions must follow standard procedures and employment law . . . The board may determine it appropriate to seek more evidence or refer the matter for further consideration. It is imperative at this time that rigorous processes are followed.\" </p> <p> Such is the media interest in the story - Soho Square was again besieged yesterday - that the board members will not be informed of the meeting's location until mid-morning.</p> <p> This could lead to some fairly frantic taxi journeys. Two members, David Sheepshanks and Peter Heard, are due to attend a Football League board meeting in the morning, and Bolton's chairman Phil Gartside has only just returned from China. </p> <p> The inquiry report, compiled by Peter Norbury of Eversheds, a Manchester-based firm, will reveal the evidence gathered from the key players.</p> <p> At the heart of the matter is the question whether the notorious conversation between David Davies and Eriksson was sufficiently unequivocal for the FA to be justified in issuing a denial. </p> <p> The testimony of both men is likely to be measured against the terms of Eriksson's contract, which includes clauses relating to his behaviour and what constitutes misconduct, and the board is likely to seek legal advice on whether they have a case against Eriksson. A majority of the board would vote for the coach to be dismissed if they felt he could be disposed of cheaply. Any move to dismiss would trigger a lengthy and potentially costly process, beginning with the board bringing disciplinary action against Eriksson or Alam. Such proceedings would require a motion to be proposed and seconded prior to a vote. </p> <p>If the vote were to end 6-6, Geoff Thompson would not have the casting vote, but merely offer a view before a second vote. For the chairman, still apparently steering today's agenda, the afternoon promises to be uncomfortable. He cleared Mark Palios of wrongdoing last week only to accept the chief executive's resignation on Sunday, a startling piece of mismanagement that infuriated many board members. </p> <p>Thompson could not be dismissed tomorrow, but he may find himself the subject of a vote of no confidence. Any motion to remove him would need to be ratified at the next meeting of the FA council in October. </p> <p>The prospect of a protracted wrangle over the leadership of the FA may be too much for some to stomach, however, and despite being deeply compromised Thompson could survive in the short term. </p> <p> A leadership team comprising the executive director David Davies, the director of football Sir Trevor Brooking, the commercial director Jonathan Hill and the head of media Adrian Bevington has adopted temporary control, and their roles may be formalised today.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Tudor's first championship match of the season saw him back in the wickets for <strong> Surrey</strong> , who ended the day on top against <strong> Worcestershire</strong> in a game which had seen them struggling at one point in the afternoon. </p> <p>Worcestershire had made a solid start in replying to 375 but Tudor's burst of three wickets in three overs helped reduce them from 159 for one to 167 for five, although the visitors rallied to close on 281 for eight. Tom Moody, their coach, put the collapse down to poor batting rather than any problem with the Oval pitch, one which is about as near to the Harleyford Road as you can get. </p> <p>Surrey had resumed on 299 for four but failed to take maximum batting points despite Mark Ramprakash's 130. He was last out as the final four wickets went for one run. </p> <p><strong> Essex</strong> are in control at the Rose Bowl after bowling <strong> Hampshire</strong> out for 177. Andre Adams was the pick of the bowlers, taking four for 46 as his side took a 239 lead into the second innings. Only John Crawley offered resistance with a half-century. Paul Grayson hit an unbeaten 63 at the second time of asking and Essex were 116 for three at stumps, a lead of 355. </p> <p>In Galle <strong> Sri Lanka </strong> opted to bat against <strong> South Africa</strong> on the first day of the first Test and although they lost quick wickets on a difficult pitch Mahela Jayawardene assembled his 12th Test century to steer them to 279 for seven. Shaun Pollock picked up four for 24 in his 15 overs. </p> <p>\"It was a very difficult day,\" said Jayawardene, who resumes today on 116. \"Every time we thought we could get on top we lost more wickets, but we have a couple of decent guys inside who can hang around a bit. I think 350 would be a very good score on this wicket. </p> <p>\"It was pretty hard as the ball was not coming on to the bat and I had to wait for the bad stuff.\"</p>",
  "Maybe it's because Britain is - let's be honest about this - a nation of drinkers that we tend to categorise drinks and people in a way that seems less prevalent elsewhere. <p>Lager drinkers? Well, they're obviously yobs - the lot of them. Gin and tonic? Imbibed almost exclusively by spinsterly women and theatrically camp men.Whisky and vodka? For only the most hardened (or problem) drinkers.</p> <p>And what about real ale, the traditionally-brewed mainstay of the British pub? That, as any fool knows, is enjoyed solely by men with extravagant beer bellies, bushy beards, knitted jumpers and sandals. They might even wear enamel badges featuring brewery logos and carry plastic bags with sandwiches in them, too.</p> <p>But the trouble with stereotypes like these is that they are, by and large, unfair. They might pass muster as topics amongst the inane chatter of some soulless Islington or Hoxton gastropub hellhole, discussed over mediocre Chablis and plates of wind-dried yak with a raspberry coulis (oh dear, that's probably another one), but that's about it.</p> <p>It's a point the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), which organises the Great British Beer Festival at Olympia, in London, every summer, has been making for a long time. The organisation does valuable work to help preserve and protect Britain's brewing and pub heritage, and the festival showcases around 450 ales from breweries throughout the UK, along with 250 ciders, lagers and perries.</p> <p>A few years ago, a sneering radio feature attempted to deride the event as being filled to the brim with drinkers helpfully conforming to the accepted norm. The reporter sent along to cover the opening night became audibly disconcerted by the sight of a crowd far more diverse than she had expected.</p> <p>But CAMRA's problem remains shifting those tired perceptions. Around 45,000 people are likely to pass through Olympia's doors before the festival ends on Saturday, and the evidence of previous years shows a large number of them will be 20 and 30-something professionals. Around one third are likely to be women.</p> <p>\"CAMRA is often seen as sandals, beer bellies and beards - but that is not true today,\" the organisation's chief executive, Mike Benner, told Reuters. \"The truth has changed. The image, unfortunately, has not.\"</p> <p>Tony Jerome, another CAMRA official, explained that real ale - a wonderful drink, especially when it is kept as impeccably as during the festival - is becoming increasingly popular among under-25s, with a survey of pub landlords showing a big increase in demand for it.</p> <p>\"We have a wide cross-section of people coming to the festival,\" he said. \"Yes, there are the more traditional drinkers in the day but, in the evening, we see quite a lot of City types - people more normally associated with wines than beers.\"</p> <p>It seemed the elements had conspired against yesterday's opening night, with torrential rain making reaching Olympia from anywhere by public transport as unpleasant a prospect as spending time in one of those gastropubs. As if that wasn't unhelpful enough, lightning damage to the roof of the main hall had left pools of water covering parts of the floor.</p> <p>Spirits, however, weren't flagging among the hardy (and impressive) turnout patronising the regionally-divided bars. The joy of drinking here is that the choice is wide enough to enable you to sample something new and different every time your glass needs refilling.</p> <p>Among the beers I enjoyed last night were the Woodforde's-brewed Admiral's Reserve (Norfolk), Copper Dragon Dark Ale (Yorkshire), Maypole Mayfair (Nottinghamshire), Lees Scorcher (Greater Manchester), and Iceni Raspberry Wheat (Norfolk again).</p> <p>It was distressing that the Wizard brewery's Mother In Law bitter was temporarily unavailable, and there just wasn't time to try Kelham Island Pale Rider (voted this year's champion beer of Britain), Hopdaemon Skrimshander, Spectrum Old Stoatwobbler, Rudgate Well Blathered, Tring Side Pocket for a Toad, or Rooster's Hooligan.</p> <p>Anyone seized by hunger during the course of their voyage of alcoholic discovery at what, for a few days, is the biggest pub in the world, can sate it with a range of good food, and there's live entertainment (everything from Chas and Dave to the Fulham brass band) on offer as well.</p> <p>If you've never thought of yourself as real ale fan, or found yourself put off by those stereotypes, the Olympia festival is the perfect place at which to change all that. It is, to borrow the title of a Stonehenge brewery beer, Second to None.</p>",
  "Labour today put on the backburner proposals to give the Welsh assembly its own law-making powers - but promised that the devolved body in Cardiff will get greater leeway under a third Labour government. <p>The party also ruled out giving the assembly tax-raising powers or reducing the number of Westminster MPs covering the principality.</p> <p>Announcing Labour's response to the Richard commission on the future of the assembly, the first minister, Rhodri Morgan, and the Welsh secretary, Peter Hain, pledged to reform the current voting system, under which candidates to the 60-strong body can stand on both first-past-the-post and the proportional top-up lists.</p> <p>The Labour document Better Governance for Wales comes as a formal response to the Richard commission, which set out schemes for expanding the seven-year-old Welsh assembly back in March.</p> <p>Lord Richard called for the assembly to have its own law-making powers by 2011, and for another 20 assembly members (AMs) to be added to the devolved body.</p> <p>He also said it was \"desirable but not essential\" for it to have its own tax-raising powers - something today's Labour response explicitly rules out.</p> <p>The far-ranging scope of the March report appeared to take Labour aback, as several Westminster MPs for Wales are known to be against giving the assembly further powers.</p> <p>Today's response - to be voted on at a special Welsh Labour conference next month, before going to the full Brighton conference in October for ratification - sees Mr Hain and Mr Morgan agreeing that Welsh AMs should have more role in Westminster's pre-legislative scrutiny of bills.</p> <p>If Labour wins the next general election, the party promises to quickly vote to allow more \"framework\" legislation at Westminster - which would allow the assembly more discretion in applying and amending laws.</p> <p>But the document is more sceptical on allowing primary law-making powers, such as those enjoyed by the Scottish parliament, describing this merely as \"one option\".</p> <p>That option could be presented in a post-election white paper, it says, which would have to get through both the Commons and Lords, and then be subject to a referendum in Wales.</p> <p>But it also proposes another option which would give the assembly the same \"framework\" freedoms in devolved areas of governance, but allowed to be applied retrospectively.</p> <p>Although that would appear more of a \"third way\" compromise between the status quo and full law-making powers, today one senior Labour figure said it could be harder to get through parliament than full powers.</p> <p>\"I actually think we could win a referendum, whereas this would be seen as bringing in law-making powers by the back door, and would be harder to sell,\" he said.</p> <p>Either way, both options remain several years down the road.</p> <p>Announcing the plans, Mr Hain defended the proposals against accusations of a complex fudge, telling Guardian Unlimited: \"This is actually a carefully negotiated road map forward for Wales, as opposed to the posturing and constitutional wishlists of the opposition.</p> <p>\"It will also end the ridiculous farce whereby people who are defeated in constituencies then get elected on the list system.\"</p> <p>However, the Tories in Wales called it a \"cobbled together compromise\" and the Lib Dems a victory for Labour's \"anti-devolution wing\".</p> <p>Mike German, the leader of the Welsh Lib Dems, said Labour were \"happy to swim in a series of U-turns,\" with Mr Morgan showing \"no leadership at all\".</p> <p>He said: \"Mr Morgan is known to be in favour of primary powers yet he has placed the interests of Labour's anti-devolution wing ahead of the interests of the nation.</p> <p>The Tory leader in the assembly, Nick Bourne, said: \"Rhodri Morgan appears to be more concerned with preventing internal warfare within the Labour party than governing for the whole of Wales.\"</p> <p>Today's official Labour response came after consultation around 1,800 party members, trade unions and constituency Labour parties.</p>",
  "Thousands of Gibraltarians today held hands to create a human chain around the tiny territory as they defied protests from neighbouring Spain to celebrate 300 years of British rule. <p>The day's festivities, which include a visit by the British defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and a parade of 300 sailors, were criticised by Madrid as \"insensitive\", bearing in mind the centuries-old dispute over the territory.</p> <p>Spain's prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, led the chorus of disapproval. \"Neither the government nor the immense majority of Spanish society thinks what we have seen is appropriate,\" he told reporters. </p> <p>\"But we have a 300-year-old problem, and we have to tackle it with caution, calm, and with dialogue.\"</p> <p>The country's foreign minister, Miguel Moratinos, expressed similar sentiments in an article published in the El Pa\u00eds newspaper. </p> <p>\"Nobody can deny the Gibraltarians the right to commemorate their own history. However, some exercise of self-restraint might have been expected from the British government\" as a fellow EU member, he said.</p> <p>Spain lost the deep-sea harbour and strategic naval base on August 4 1704, and has called for its reinstatement as part of the Spanish mainland ever since. Most recently, Spanish officials lodged formal protests over the recent visit to Gibraltar of princess Anne, and the docking of the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Tireless. Both Downing Street and the government in Gibraltar today sought to play down the tensions.</p> <p>\"We have a good relationship with the Spanish. They are an EU and Nato partner. It would be appropriate for a member of the Cabinet to attend the ceremonies there - I don't think there is any difficulty with that,\" said a Downing Street spokesman.</p> <p>The territory's chief minister, Peter Caruana, told journalists that neither recent visits nor the celebrations were intended as a snub Spain's new government. </p> <p>\"Neither the Tireless, nor the royal visit of the princess, nor Mr Hoon's visit are not to snub the ruling Socialist party. The three events were programmed well before [Spain's] elections,\" Mr Caruana said.</p> <p>He insisted on Gibraltarians' right to celebrate their past, saying: \"It would be unacceptable to erase some aspects of our history. We are proud of our history, including the military aspects.\"</p> <p>Despite the diplomatic language, tensions were still evident. Earlier this week, Mr Caruana told Madrid that the celebrations were \"none of their business\", and local residents who participated in today's human chain expressed their thoughts in equally forthright terms.</p> <p>\"We are going to prove to the world that nobody can take Gibraltar from us,\" said Lilian Carroll, a 60-year-old resident.</p> <p>Gibraltar's government declared the day a national holiday called the day of freedom, and the territory's parliament presented the freedom of the city award to the Royal Navy, which deployed the frigate HMS Grafton to the scene. </p> <p>Gibraltar is a rocky outcrop measuring 5.8 sq km (2.25 sq miles) at the tip of the Iberian peninsula. It juts into the Mediterranean Sea at the point where it narrows to an eight mile (15km) strait separating Europe from Africa. </p> <p>Britain was ceded formal control of the territory by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, and its current position is that no change of the territory's status can be negotiated with Spain unless its residents agree. </p> <p>A proposal for joint Spanish-British sovereignty for the territory fell through in 2002 after almost 99% of voters on the Rock rejected the plan in a non-binding referendum.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is transsexualism?</strong><br> Transsexualism is a form of gender dysphoria or a gender identity disorder (GID) in which a person possesses a strong and enduring desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex. Transsexuals feel a persistent discomfort with their anatomical sex and a sense of unease in the gender role of that sex. They wish to have hormonal treatment and gender reassignment surgery - a sex change - to acquire the physical characteristics of their psychological sex. The term transsexual first emerged in the 1950s and had gained widespread acceptance within the medical profession by the mid-1960s.</p> <p><strong>Is it a form of mental illness?</strong><br> Although gender dysphoria is listed in the US Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders, most transsexuals and UK transgender psychiatrists do not consider transsexualism to be a mental illness. However, due to the discrimination and prejudice they face many transsexuals do suffer from mental health problems.</p> <p><strong>How many transsexuals are there?</strong><br> A report from the Interdepartmental Working Group on Transsexual People in 2000 estimated that there were 1,300-2,000 male-to-female and 250-400 female-to-male transsexuals in the UK. However the transgender lobby group, Press for Change, puts the numbers far higher. It estimates there are 5,000 post-operative transsexuals in this country. </p> <p><strong>What treatment is there for transsexuals?</strong><br> The currently accepted and effective model of treatment involves hormonal therapy and surgical reconstruction, and may include counselling and other forms of psychotherapy. There are minimum guidelines which set eligibility criteria for patients. But the course of treatment can be tailored to the individual's needs, and is usually negotiated among the patient's GP and the psychiatrist and surgeon providing specialist care. </p> <p><strong>What does hormonal therapy involve?</strong><br> Male-to-female patients treated with oestrogens can expect to experience: breast growth, some redistribution of body fat in line with a more feminine appearance; decreased upper body strength; softening of the skin; a decrease in body hair; slowing or stopping of loss of scalp hair; decreased fertility and testicular size; and less frequent, less firm erections. Female-to-male patients treated with testosterone can expect the following permanent changes: a deepening of the voice; clitoral enlargement; reduction in breast size; more facial and body hair; and male pattern baldness. Reversible changes include: increased upper body strength; weight gain; increased sex drive; and decreased hip fat.</p> <p><strong>What surgery is performed?</strong><br> Depending on the appearance and health of the patient, surgery for male-to-female transsexuals may include: removal of the penis (penectomy); construction of a vagina (vaginoplasty); removal of the testicles (orchidectomy); construction of a clitoris (clitoroplasty); and possible breast augmentation; nose reshaping (rhinoplasty); cosmetic surgery such as hair transplants or facial remodelling; shaving of the Adam's apple (thyroid chrondroplasty) and raising the pitch of the voice (crico-thyroid approximation). For female-to-male (FTMs) transsexuals, surgery may include removal of the womb and ovaries (hysterectomy and oophorectomy); removal of the breasts (bilateral mastectomy); and possibly construction of a penis (phalloplasty). Only a small number of FTM transsexuals undergo genital surgery because - at best - the results only vaguely resemble a penis.</p> <p><strong>What other treatments are there?</strong><br> Male-to-female transsexuals may undergo electrolysis to remove their beard and body hair. Transsexuals might also seek speech therapy to help attune their voices to their acquired gender.</p> <p><strong>Are there any rules governing this treatment?</strong><br> Although there are no legally binding rules, standards of care have been drawn up by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA). The association has established standards of care for the treatment of GIDs, which are generally accepted by psychiatrists across the world. These standards are revised to take into account new scientific information, and were last updated in 2001. They provide \"flexible directions\" for the treatment of transsexuals, which may be modified in line with a patient's particular needs and circumstances. They include minimum eligibility requirements for some procedures, such as the prescription of hormones and referrals for genital surgery.</p> <p><strong>What do the guidelines state?</strong><br> With regards to hormonal therapy, the HBIGDA guidelines set three criteria. Firstly, patients should be over 18. Secondly, they should be aware of the effects and risks of taking the drugs. And thirdly, they should have documented proof that they were living in their desired gender role for at least three months (known as the \"real life experience\"); or have undergone a minimum of three months of psychotherapy. With regards to surgery, there are six eligibility criteria, the most important of which are that the patient should be a legal adult; have had 12 months of continuous hormone therapy; and have lived in their desired gender role for a year - a period known as the real life experience. There are also two readiness criteria. Patients should demonstrate that they are consolidating their gender identity, and enjoy better mental health as a result of dealing effectively with work, their family and relationships. Psychiatrists are required to check that patients meet these criteria.</p> <p><strong>Why are the guidelines important?</strong><br> Some of the procedures are irreversible, so patients need to fully understand and be prepared for treatment. Some of the side-effects of hormone therapy, such as an increase in blood clotting, can be life threatening to patients in poor health, for example those with heart disease. Some people with psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia and manic depression, may mistakenly believe they are transsexual, but a thorough psychological assessment should prevent misdiagnosis. Transgender psychiatrists also admit that the boundaries between transsexualism, transvestism and homosexuality are not entirely clear to them. The guidelines help them to determine which patients are truly transsexual.</p> <p><strong>Are the guidelines officially recognised in the UK?</strong><br> The standards of care are \"generally supported\" by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), though it does not formally recognise them. There is disagreement among psychiatrists over the period patients should spend living as their desired sex prior to hormone therapy and surgery. Dr Brian Ferguson, a member of the RCP's working party on GID, supports a two-year real life experience prior to genital surgery - twice the length of time recommended by the HBIGDA. The college is working towards drawing up UK guidelines in partnership with the transgendered community.

  "Four Jordanian hostages have been freed unharmed in Iraq after a tribal chief apparently organised a raid on the house in which they had been held for eight days, it was reported today. <p>Meanwhile, two Turkish drivers being held hostage by a different militant group will be released, their captors said. </p> <p>The announcement came after the hostages' company said it would stop sending trucks to US troops in Iraq, the Arab satellite channel al-Jazeera reported. Later, the Turkish foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, told Turkish radio the men had been freed.</p> <p>News of the hostages' release came as reports this afternoon emerged of fierce fighting between police and militants in the northern city of Mosul. </p> <p>Officials said 12 Iraqis had died in the fighting and 26 were wounded. </p> <p>Dozens of masked men with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers moved through the streets in the Bab al-Toub area of the city. Police headed to the area and a gun battle, punctuated by explosions, took place.</p> <p>In response to the violence, the provincial governor, Doreid Mohammed Kashmoula, announced an early curfew.</p> <p>Sheikh Haj Ibrahim Jassam, who said he was a tribal chief in Falluja, told the Associated Press that the Jordanian hostages - three drivers and a businessman - were safe in his home. </p> <p>They had been named as Ahmad Abu Jaafar, Mohammad Ahmad Khleifat, Khaled Ibrahim Masoud and Ahmad Tayseer Sunokrot.</p> <p>Sheikh Jassam told the agency he had last night received word that the four Jordanians were being held in a house on the edge of the city and had decided to act. </p> <p>\"I called upon my brothers and tribesmen to free the hostages, so we raided the house last night,\" he said, adding that the kidnappers had fled. \"I'm glad those innocent Muslims were freed.\"</p> <p>One of the freed hostages, Ahmad Abu Jaafar, said the men had been kidnapped along the main highway eight days ago by a group that never named its demands for their freedom. </p> <p>\"The kidnappers have nothing to do with the resistance,\" he said. \"I thank God and the people of Falluja, and I tell my family in Jordan not to worry because we will see them soon.\" </p> <p>The men were abducted by a group calling itself Mujahideen of Iraq. The kidnapping came to light last week when Dubai television broadcast a video showing the four men holding what appeared to be Jordanian identification cards. </p> <p>Relatives of the four had previously said the kidnappers had promised to free their captives after relatives and fellow truck drivers staged an anti-US demonstration. </p> <p>Today, Mr Jaafar called on the Jordanian government to stop supporting the US and its presence in Iraq. </p> <p>\"I wasn't delivering any goods to the US forces in Iraq - I was delivering goods to Iraqi traders, and I would rather die than serve the Americans in Iraq,\" he said. </p> <p>Sheikh Jassam called the kidnappers \"terrorists, who are not from Falluja\".</p> <p>\"What we did was in response to all the evil forces from outside Falluja who want to distort the image of the city and its people,\" he said. </p> <p>He added that he would personally return the four men to Jordan. \"No one from the Jordanian embassy has contacted me yet, but I will deliver them to their families,\" he said. </p> <p>Falluja, a Sunni stronghold where insurgents regularly engage in fierce battles with US forces, is also believed to be the safe haven for the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>The reported release of the Turkish drivers follows an announcement on Monday by other Turkish truck owners that they were suspending deliveries across the border in an attempt to secure the release of the hostages.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1274916,00.html\">disrupted an important supply chain for US troops</a> and provided further evidence of the pressure on foreign workers in the country.</p>",

  "<p>Women have been getting blamed a lot in recent weeks: for rearing emotionally maladjusted children, for displeasing the Holy Father Pope John Paul II, and for not cleaning behind the fridge amongst other sins. </p> <p>And now, if recent comments made by the current president of the Royal College of Physicians are to be believed, they are culpable too for the future decline in status of Britain's medical profession. </p> <p>Professor Carol Black, interviewed earlier this week in the Independent, claimed that <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/health_medical/story.jsp?story=546980\">the growing numbers of women entering medicine would mean trouble later</a>.</p> <p>It might seem incongruous that such a view should be expressed by only the second woman to hold the top job at the RCP in its 500-year history. </p> <p>It would be natural to assume she would prefer more rather than fewer female colleagues to chew the cud with at those lavish dinners. </p> <p>And sure enough, if you look beyond the headlines screaming medical timebomb, you soon realise that the professor's case is far from anti-progressive, ultimately calling for more action to ensure women are represented across all branches and at all levels of the profession.</p> <p>But less careful readings of these widely reported comments are likely to confirm rather than challenge culture-deep beliefs that man's destiny is to be powerful and wield influence while woman's is to be powerless and on the margins. </p> <p>Pointing to the case of Russia, where a feminised, low-paid medical workforce has little power to make its voice heard, Black insists that a similar erosion of the profession's public standing must not be allowed to happen here. </p> <p>Her belief that this is a clear and present danger hinges on the apparently observable fact of women rejecting the traditional pathways into leadership roles, preferring flexible career schemes and family-friendly hours to high pressure specialisms, academic glory and seats on government committees. </p> <p>Yet it rests on a further subtext that true professionalism has everything to do with what men already do, and nothing to do with what women say they want. </p> <p>It is women's choices, shaped by family considerations, that are framed here as incompatible with the established workings of the upper echelons of the profession, rather than the other way round. </p> <p>This tendency to reify male norms has a long pedigree and is not limited to medicine of course. Women have been fighting for the right to a legitimate professional identity for more than a century. </p> <p>An elite of Victorian feminists took higher education by storm and became pioneers in law, medicine, academia and public administration. </p> <p>Yet the reality for most educated women until WWII was the narrow choice of nursing, teaching and social work, all three regarded as suitable occupations for a woman in so far as they extended her domestic caring role. </p> <p>Just to make things harder, some employers introduced formal marriage bars for their female employees, thus institutionalising the professional incapacitation of women with husbands and homes. </p> <p>Even the rise of part-time work in more recent decades has made little more than a dent on popular beliefs that a woman's biological capacity to bear children must compromise her ability to perform professional work. </p> <p>Our mental model of good leadership still presumes 100% commitment to the job. Many men have been able to provide this for the simple reason that they've had wives willing to make family their priority. </p> <p>Some critics, particularly those on the right, question whether a woman might realistically ever \"have it all\". </p> <p>Yet Professor Black's vision of a profession in crisis ought to be read as the worst case scenario of the consequences of not making it possible for women to combine caring and career. </p> <p>In a brighter future, a feminised medical profession might actually provide women with the critical mass they need to create more inclusive, balanced leadership styles that make it possible for all to thrive.</p> <p>Making that a reality requires us to face up to the fact that for most of human history, men and women have struggled to share power. </p> <p>Underlying Professor Black's comments is a story about how gender shapes our perceptions of what a job is worth. The chances are that if a woman's doing it, men aren't interested. </p> <p>This is the patriarchal logic that reproduces occupational segregation and ensures that women's work - whatever it happens to be - is undervalued, both symbolically and in material terms. </p> <p>Of course, a 50:50 gender ratio throughout all levels of any profession is the ultimate prize for equality campaigners everywhere. </p> <p>But so far, despite the achievements of feminism and three decades of equal opportunities, the fundamental shift in the relationship between gender and power that is so badly needed has not taken place. And for that, we all have to take the blame.</p> <p><strong>Helen McCarthy is a researcher at Demos and Co-founder of Thinkingwomen. helen.mccarthy@demos.co.uk </strong></p>",
  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p><b> ON ANTI-TERRORISM POWERS</b></p> <p>David Blunkett's counter-terrorism plans have been criticised by yet another hostile committee of MPs. It won't deter him, the Guardian's home affairs editor Alan Travis told the Backbencher this afternoon.</p> <p>\"The emergency counter-terrorism powers under which 12 suspected international terrorists have been held in indefinite detention in British prisons for up to two-and-a-half years should be urgently repealed, according to a report published today by a cross-party group of MPs and peers.</p> <p>\"The parliamentary joint committee on human rights says there is 'discrimination inherent' in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act passed in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. They also say there is mounting evidence that other counter-terrorism powers, particularly stop and search, have been used disproportionately against the Muslim community in Britain.</p> <p>\"But perhaps more significantly, the human rights committee, chaired by the Labour MP Jean Corston, says the fact that Britain has had to secure an 'opt-out' from key parts of the European convention on human rights in order to use these powers has actually had a 'corrosive effect on the culture of respect for human rights in Britain'.</p> <p>\"The conclusions of the committee, whose membership includes some real experts in the field such as Lord Lester, Kevin McNamara, and Richard Shepherd, are a real blow to David Blunkett's hopes of creating a consensus on where Britain's anti-terror laws should go next.</p> <p>\"Mr Blunkett was surprised by the ferocity of the response when he floated his original ideas for reform during his trip to India and Pakistan earlier this year. It now transpires that the attorney-general and the director of public prosecutions were among the critics of his ideas for reducing the standard of proof in terrorist cases, and for pre-emptive in camera trials of would-be suicide bombs with vetted counsel. </p> <p>\"The home secretary has abandoned most of those ideas, but is still keen to explore ways in which the intelligence material on which so many terrorist cases depend can be used in a British criminal trial without compromising security sources. If he manages to solve that problem, then many of those foreign nationals currently detained indefinately in Belmarsh prison could instead be put on trial.</p> <p>\"The joint human rights committee is actually keen on several of the alternatives that Mr Blunkett is exploring in terrorist cases where more conventional police evidence simply does not exist. They back the idea of lifting the ban on the use of telephone tap and other intercept evidence in British trials. Blunkett is keen to do this, but the security services are still raising objections. They also like the idea of civil restriction orders under which curfews and electronic tagging are used to mount an intensive surveillance operation of suspected terrorists.</p> <p>\"But they are not keen on the idea of creating a new specific criminal offence of 'acts preparatory to terrorism'. It is believed that Mr Blunkett is close to a decision to go ahead with this idea. MPs and peers, however, are sceptical that it would actually lead to prosecutions that are currently not possible.</p> <p>\"But one thing is now clear. When Mr Blunkett makes his final decision on the new counter-terrorism law he is to put forward this autumn he has no intention of allowing his emergency powers to detain suspected international terrorists to lapse, no matter how loudly his critics shout.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/attacks/story/0,1320,1275907,00.html\">News story: Human rights committee warns Blunkett</a></p> <p><b> LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Congratulations to Stacey Frier of the RSPCA, who identified Rob Marris as the MP who wants fireworks to be given decibel ratings. \"Is there any particular reason this EDM was chose as the comp question?\" she adds. The Backbencher will tread carefully here, as Stacey's email signature urges the recipient to support Ben Bradshaw's Be Nice To Your Pet bill. It's hard to believe, but a couple of readers have suggested that some irresponsible Britons would seize the opportunity to set off the loudest bangers they could find. Obviously, the punishment for that kind of anti-social behaviour should be based on the sentence meted out to Guy Fawkes. But unless David Blunkett can find a way to enforce it, the Backbencher fears a hasty amendment to the Fireworks bill could do more harm than good.</p> <p><b> THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>This week's prize is just the thing for Backbencher readers who are keen to impress their bosses and tutors in the autumn.

It has been a difficult decision - representing you for the past twelve years has been one of the greatest privileges of my life.\" Further down the letter, the quitter hints at what might become of Jean's town under a Lib Dem MP. \"Having a Labour MP working with a Labour government has helped make Hartlepool a better place to live,\" he warns. Cannily, he makes no mention of the B-word. \"You can be assured that although I will be in a different place, I will never stop representing the interests of Hartlepool people,\" he signs off. Peter, these euphemisms don't suit you. It's Brussels - be proud of it. Incidentally, readers wishing to follow the minutiae of the Hartlepool byelection can do so <a href=\"http://guacamoleville.blogspot.com\">here</a>.</p> <p><b> BODES ILL</b></p> <p>Meanwhile, another departing MP and part-time poet Paul Marsden tells the Shrewsbury Chronicle why it's time to move on. \"I'd like to be able to write more and get things published and to have a private life again,\" he explains. In the meantime, Paul's infamous collection of poems, \"Waiting for Westminster\", has been pulled from his website. Could this mean it has found a publisher? Since Paul complains of press intrusion into his private life, the Backbencher will just have to speculate.</p> <p><b> CLEAR BLUE WATER</b></p> <p>Dr Fox is on tour. Well, it's not what Conservative Central Office would call a holiday, but it certainly sounds like the most pleasant kind of business trip. Liam has been despatched to Hong Kong, Dubai and Johannesburg on an ambassadorial mission. Rather than promoting Britain, however, Liam will be reminding expats of just how ghastly dreary old Blighty has become under Labour rule.</p> <p>He has, apparently, \"stepped up the Conservative assault on Tony Blair's 'fat government', and emphasised the need for a more streamlined adminstration at Whitehall.\" That should keep the expats awake. Liam will also be talking about \"enhancing prospects for lower tax levels\", a phrase that sounds about as convincing as a declaration of fidelity from Faria Alam. Still, there's nothing like winning over the people at the sharp end of Labour's atrocious public services. </p> <p><b> PITCH OFF</b></p> <p>Labour's marketing team, meanwhile, appears to have been infected by a touch of the Maurice Saatchis. \"The Labour Party today launched its on-line Big Brother-style 'Tory House of Turmoil' website,\" writes Dorothea in the press office. \"Vote your least favourite Tory out.\" Look, this kind of thing is the Backbencher's job, and even she wouldn't touch a concept this bad. Lord Saatchi, we learn, is \"too stuck in his ways. Has failed to adapt to new format and his housemates are grumbling he just has a negative attitude.\" Maybe he needs a change of scene.

  "<p>When it comes to the serious business of child's play, most parents simply don't have what it takes. My nine-year-old recently gave me incontrovertible proof that I was one of these failures in the fun department. She had spent the night at the house of one of her friends. She likes going there, she told me, because after supper, \"The mum and dad play board games with us (pause for maximum effect) for a very long time. And even when it's not a Saturday.\" </p> <p>The idea of doing anything very much after supper apart from sitting comatose on the sofa, holding, if not reading, a newspaper, is sufficient to trigger in me a sense of extreme fatigue. The thought of a three-hour marathon game of Monopoly, or acting out the bit in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when Hermione throws a punch at Malfoy, again and again, is likely to produce a bout of nervous exhaustion. But nothing can assuage my guilt. </p> <p>Today is Playday, the UK's largest annual celebration of play, now in its 17th year. More than 100,000 children will attend dozens of events, including the conversion of Trafalgar Square into a playground. The occasion has been coordinated by the Children's Society in partnership with the Children's Play Council. Playday promotes an admirable cause - children's right and need to play - while also campaigning to provide opportunities for them to do so. </p> <p>Research tells us that the kind of play that allows an element of risk and exploration and challenge, supported - but not policed by - grown-ups, is as vital to a child's development and quality of life as literacy and numeracy. Earlier this year, the government published Getting Serious about Play: a Review of Child's Play, designed to establish the principles by which \u00a3200m of lottery cash from the New Opportunities Fund will be spent, focusing particularly on provision for the disabled and the marginalised living in deprived areas. </p> <p>Frank Dobson, who chaired the six-month review, defined the concept of play as, \"What children do when they are given the freedom to follow their own ideas and interests in their own way and for their own reasons.\" </p> <p>Through play, says Tim Gill, director of the Children's Play Council, the young acquire confidence and independence. \"They learn not just physical skills but how to socialise, how to solve problems and how to handle success and failure.\" </p> <p>All of which assumes that play is a group activity as well as a solitary exercise - and that it does not involve several hours in front of the television set, failing to burn up the calories, consumed as the afternoon wears on. </p> <p>Studies tell us that the vast majority of parents understand the importance of the theory of \"free\" play - although that still doesn't stop some of them from turning it into a highly-organised and subscribed branch of education. Or, they insist that everyone does exactly what they say - or they are going to tell. </p> <p>Another difficulty is that we live in a time-squeezed adult society in which every minute counts and control is deemed vital. Paid work also often steals the time a parent might otherwise spend with a child. All these pressures are completely contrary to the essence of successful play - that it is unending, fluid, anarchic. In my own case, I admit to being a bit of a clock-watcher. I'm not bad at building tents in the bedroom; dressing Bratz dolls and sticking bits of cardboard together. However, I am occasionally reprimanded for being present in the flesh but absent in mind and spirit. \"Why do you look as if you're somewhere else?\" both daughters have been known to complain from time to time. Probably, because I am. </p> <p>The government is considering offering parenting classes not just to those adults whose offspring are considered vulnerable but to anyone who is willing to attend. Classes are likely to include suggestions not just on what to play at different stages of a child's life, but also how to play (back off: you're the adult). Since people appear far more willing these days to own up to not having much of a clue about aspects of parenting (without risk of an invasion of social workers), this could be good news for children. </p> <p>Lisa Knapett is a single mother of five children, aged three to 14; she co-chairs the East Peckham Sure Start Parents Forum, and has just qualified as a volunteer to teach other parents how to play. She says it is difficult to find games that all her children want to play together - or to find sufficient time for them individually, so they each have after-school activities, such as Brownies, and she arranges a lot of day trips in the holidays. </p> <p>\"We live in a three-bedroom flat, and the younger ones get all the toys out, but we have big clearing up sessions at the end of each day. In the holidays, I try to arrange for us to be out as much as possible. </p> <p>\"Playing with the children has got easier now. When I was a young mother with two children, I didn't have a family network around me so I joined mother and toddler groups and learned as I went along. Play is about being open-minded and not trying to take over. I let them lead me and do what they want. My mum never played with me and I always remember playing on my own. So, I took a real pleasure in playing with my children. I'm creative so we do colouring and writing and lots of arts and crafts. I really enjoy sitting down in the evening, cuddling up and reading a story. I'm quite busy but I believe it's quality not quantity time that counts.\" </p> <p>A recent poll commissioned by the Children's Society gauged how often parents and children play together. While most parents (72%) said they played with their children daily - the majority of the young, aged from seven to 12, said their parents played with them either rarely or never. Whatever grown-ups think they are doing, it is not being classed as a bundle of fun. </p> <p>Children reported that adults failed to play because they were either too busy or too tired; or the children themselves opted not to play because a parent was too bossy; or didn't know how to play the games - or because friends were better company. One seven-year-old said, \"I think it's sometimes a bit harder for older people to play because they lose their imagination.\" </p> <p>Craig Dwyer is father of two children, Thomas, six, and Imogen, four. He works long hours at the BBC and sometimes has to travel. His wife, Anne, is a full-time mother. \"If I can arrange it, I'm home at around 7pm for bedtime and books,\" he says. \"The weekend is the time for more adventure, riding a bike or football. The difficulty is that Thomas and Imogen often want to go off in different directions out of spite as much as anything else. Both are very creative and love to make things. I'm not as free; I'm always clearing up. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I find it difficult to switch after a hectic day to a mood for play. It's as if I haven't had time to decompress and as soon as you open the door, the children are full on. </p> <p>\"My wife is very playful with the children, she's always keen for them to exercise their freedom and she encourages them to explore. My parents didn't play with me that much but then I lived in Kent and it was easier for us to roam around. In London, it's much more difficult for children to discover independence.\" </p> <p>The Children's Society and the Children's Play Council are urging parents to be more \"playful\" and, today, to take half a day for play. Tim Gill says, \"Playful parenting is about putting to one side our adult cares, engaging with our children and having fun.\" </p> <p>The trouble is that it all sounds a bit coy and forced - like asking a great aunt to tango under the delusion that it will bring zest back into all aspects of her life. Play has to be brought much more to the foreground of the public arena (not least as a counterweight to the view that children are always a problem). But that also requires more family-friendly flexibility in the work place. It is also handicapped by the government's apparent determination to turn each child's every waking minute into preparation for the next stage of schooling. Skipping? Goodness me no - not unless you count the skips and divide by five! </p> <p>In the 60s, fun was a central part of the hippy philosophy. Somehow, ever since, adults have grown progressively more serious: too grown-up for their own good. So, how do we, as adults, learn to switch off, cool down, and tune in to a world that is only a child's imagination away? Perhaps we could start by asking the experts - our sons and daughters. And take the time to listen. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Events for Playday and The Children's Society's \"Ten tips for playful parenting\" can be found at <a href=\"http://www.playday.org.uk.\">www.playday.org.uk.</a></p>",

Over 106,000 complaints about cowboy builders were registered with Trading Standards officers, and official complaints are growing at around 5% a year.</p> <p>But improving your home doesn't have to turn you into the victim of a conniving contractor. There are measures you can take to ensure you don't fall prey to the unscrupulous. Firstly, you could use a builder recommended by a friend or family member - a thumbs-up from someone you trust is worth a lot. However, you should still tread carefully here, especially if the job you want done is completely different to the one your friend asked for. </p> <p>Alternatively you could take a drive around your area, looking for signs put up by builders after work has been completed and taking notes of those who seem to have done a good job. Or look in the local newspaper for names that appear regularly, or are mentioned in a positive light. </p> <p>Another way of finding a reputable builder is through trade organisations such as the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), an independent, non-profit trade association which represents around 13,000 small to medium sized building firms, all of which sign up to its strict code of practice. </p> <p>Its websites, <a href=\"http://www.fmb.org.uk\"> fmb.org.uk </a> and <a href=\"http://www.findabuilder.co.uk\"> findabuilder.co.uk</a>, have plenty of useful tips on how to find a good builder. Findabuilder.co.uk can, as the name suggests, help you find a builder in your area - all you have to do is enter the first part of your postcode, telephone area code, town, village or county into the system and it will list up to 15 FMB members. If your needs are a bit broader, it can also help you find people in other areas, such as plumbers or landscape gardeners. </p> <p>However, while the FMB has high standards for entry onto its register, it doesn't carry out regular checks on its members. Andrew Large, external affairs manager for the FMB says: \"We don't physically go out and inspect builders after they have registered with us but when they renew their registration we do ask that they recommit to our codes of practice.\"</p> <p>You could also look for a builder approved by the <a href=\"http://www.qualitymark.org.uk\"> Quality Mark </a>scheme (tel 0845 300 8040). Quality Mark is a government-backed register, currently being rolled out across the country, where consumers can search for reputable builders and other tradespeople. More than 595 firms are already accredited by the scheme and over 640 are still undergoing the process of joining the register.</p> <p>None of the registers are totally foolproof so you should find out as much as you can before taking on a particular firm. Once you have a shortlist of builders who seem suitable, ask for references and talk to previous customers of the contractor you have in mind. Ian Davis, director general of the FMB, says: \"A building firm could be in your home for several weeks, so it is important that you trust them. Get references, which a good professional will be happy to provide.\" </p> <p>If a builder claims to be part of a trade association, don't just take their word for it. Check that they really are members before going ahead with any building work. There are plenty of different quality stamps out there, which can be pretty confusing, and rogue traders have been known to lie about being part of a trade association.</p> <p>When it comes to agreeing a price, you should get quotations from two or three different builders. It's important to be clear about what you want and ask for the quote in writing. \"Don't just rely on a builder saying it'll cost around \u00a310,000,\" says Mr Davis. The FMB says you should avoid builders who offer you a cheap deal for cash in hand. \"It's the first sign of getting involved with a rogue trader looking to avoid VAT payments. Also with no contract and cash in hand there is nothing to stop these traders from disappearing into the ether with your money,\" explains Mr Large. </p> <p>Beware, too, of the difference between a quotation and an estimate. A quotation is a fixed price that the builder can't change once you have accepted it, even if they have to carry out more work than expected. An estimate, on the other hand, amounts to an educated guess. It isn't binding, and it means that you could end up paying more.</p> <p>It's common sense, but make sure you get everything in writing, and avoid builders who insist that a written contract is not necessary - it is vital. A contract can prevent misunderstandings and establish the cost and duration of a project. Contracts can also provide you with peace of mind and ammunition if the builder doesn't complete the job according to your specifications. You can download a standard contract for free from the FMB's website. </p> <p>Once the job's under way, monitor the builder's progress. \"If it is a complicated job, arrange a regular half-hour with your builder on agreed days,\" advises Mr Davis. If you encounter any problems it is essential not to panic or let the builder carry on regardless. Communicate with your builder immediately if you are unhappy with the work as most things can be rectified before completion. But remember to talk to the person in charge - telling subcontractors that you are unhappy with work or that you want to change your mind about something will only add confusion. </p> <p>If there is a problem, you should first complain, in writing, to the company concerned and give them the opportunity to set the matter right. However, if you can't resolve matters yourself with your builder, it's time to contact the trade association. </p> <p>If the builder is a FMB member, the FMB's service includes advising customers and working with both parties should there be any kind of a dispute. The Quality Mark Scheme says that if you are unhappy with one of its members you can contact its call centre, which will direct the complaint to an independent claims handler. And if your builder is not registered with a trade association, you can contact your local trading standards office to make a complaint. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Office of Fair Trading has compiled a step-by-step guide, entitled <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/52A3BE91-C04C-4972-9254-9DB70403206D/0/oft118b.pdf\">Need a Plumber or a builder?

  "<b>Where is Gibraltar? </b> <p>It is a stony outcrop at the southern end of the Iberian peninsula, to which it is linked by a narrow isthmus. It marks the meeting point of the Mediterranean sea and the Atlantic ocean. </p> <p><b>Is it strategically important? </b></p> <p>In historical terms, it was one of the great maritime prizes; these days, given the awesome weaponry of the world's great powers and the range of their navies, it is a great deal less important. </p> <p><b>How did Britain acquire sovereignty over Gibraltar? </b></p> <p>Gibraltar was captured in 1704 during the war of Spanish succession by an Anglo-Dutch fleet. British sovereignty was formalised in 1713 by the treaty of Utrecht and Gibraltar became a British colony in 1830. </p> <p>Spain has made several unsuccessful attempts to recapture it: the Rock has endured 15 sieges, the most famous of which started in 1779 and lasted more than three years. General Franco, the Spanish dictator, closed the border with Gibraltar in the 1940s and a second cut-off was imposed in the 60s. </p> <p><b>How is Gibraltar ruled today? </b></p> <p>The British governor's monopoly of legislative authority ended only in 1950, with the establishment of a legislative council. In 1963 Gibraltar's status came before the UN's special committee on decolonisation. </p> <p>Spain tried to revive its claim to the Rock and increased restrictions at the border between Gibraltar and Spain, a process that culminated in the closure of the frontier and the end of direct communications with the mainland in 1969. </p> <p>In the same year Britain granted Gibraltar a new constitution under which the functions of the legislative and city councils were merged and a Gibraltar House of Assembly was set up establishing self-government in domestic matters. </p> <p>The constitution states that the sovereignty of the island will not be changed without the inhabitants' consent. Full independence, however, is not a realistic option as the Utrecht treaty specifies that Spain must have first refusal if the Rock's status ever changes.</p> <p><b>Is Gibraltar part of the EU? </b></p> <p>Gibraltar is the only British overseas territory to be technically part of the union, but it is not a member: the UK is responsible for all external interests. Gibraltar is also excluded from the customs union and the common agricultural policy. </p> <p>For the first time, however - and before the EU expanded to encompass 25 states - it was agreed that Gibraltar would be attached to the UK's south-west constituency in elections to the European parliament.</p> <p>So in June this year, Gibraltarians voted for the first time in a pan-European election. The overall constituency result saw three Conservatives MEPs, two from the UK Independence party, one Labour and one Liberal Democrat elected.</p> <p><b>What is happening today? </b></p> <p>The choice of Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, to represent the British government at today's anniversary celebrations is being seen as a snub - deliberate or unconscious - to the Spanish government. The country's new, socialist government strongly opposed the war in Iraq, unlike its predecessor, led by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. </p> <p>The high-profile representation of the British government contrasts starkly with a commemorative church service for Gibraltar in London in March, which was attended by the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, the party's former leader Margaret Thatcher and the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram. Only Baroness Symons, a Labour peer, attended on behalf of the government.</p> <p>Today's celebrations began with a 21-gun salute by the arriving HMS Grafton, which also angered Spaniards. This episode goes against the grain of the British and Spanish governments' relations since the election of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero in April, when it was agreed that the issue should be left on the back burner for the time being.</p> <p><b>Do tensions already exist?</b></p> <p>Border delays and Madrid-imposed restrictions on telephone lines have not helped improve relations between Spain and Gibraltar. Spain claims full sovereignty over Gibraltar, home to 35,000 British citizens who vehemently oppose any change to their status. However, the British government is eager to come to an agreement with Spain, a key EU partner. </p> <p><b>How have the citizens of Gibraltar expressed their views on sovereignty? </b></p> <p>On Thursday November 7 2002 a referendum was held on the issue of joint sovereignty between Britain and Spain. Almost 99% of voters on the Rock gave a thumbs down to the idea. </p> <p>The poll was devised by Gibraltar's government and was not legally binding on Britain. Even before it happened it was dismissed as irrelevant by the British and Spanish governments. </p> <p>But there is no doubt that the vote, unofficial and pre-emptive as it was, sent a clear message to politicians about the strength of feeling in Gibraltar against losing unalloyed British sovereignty. </p> <p><b>What precipitated the referendum? </b> </p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, and Mr Aznar were keen to resolve the issue of Gibraltar. A dialogue between Spain and Britain began about 18 months prior to the vote. Then, on June 12 2002, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, announced to the Commons that both Britain and Spain had agreed shared sovereignty was the best way forward after months of talks. </p> <p>This galvanised opposition in Gibraltar. The plebiscite was called by Gibraltar's chief minister, Peter Caruana, in protest at Mr Straw's statement. </p> <p>Almost the entire population of Gibraltar turned out for a mass pro-British demonstration in March, and Mr Straw was welcomed to the Rock by shouts of \"traitor\" and \"Judas\" from 2,000 protesters. The Gibraltarian government even took out a series of full-page advertisements in British newspapers pleading for support from the British public </p> <p><b>What was the substance of the deal with Spain? </b></p> <p>As well as agreeing to share sovereignty, Britain and Spain planned to give a much greater degree of self-government to Gibraltar. Gibraltarians were given assurances over cultural differences from Spaniards and the primacy of the English language. Mr Straw promised they would retain their British citizenship and a maximum amount of autonomy. </p> <p>All powers other than foreign affairs and defence would be handed over to Gibraltar. In the words of Mr Straw's sales pitch, the Rock would enjoy \"greater self-government and practical benefits of a cooperative relationship with the kingdom of Spain and its people\".</p> <p><b>Could Britain and Spain try to force a deal? </b></p> <p>The inhabitants of the two-and-a-quarter square mile Rock fear the two governments will ignore their wishes and that they will be forced to accept some degree of Spanish rule. </p> <p>The day before the referendum, Mr Blair denied that any \"grubby deal\" had been hatched with Spain; many Gibraltarians, however, believe the UK government secretly plans to \"sell out\" to Madrid.</p> <p>Before the demonstrations and referendum, the UK government appeared to believe that a concerted campaign could sway Gibraltarian opinion in favour of the deal. Sweeteners included the promise of a possible \u00a335m in EU aid to Gibraltar if it accepted a sovereignty deal. </p> <p><b>What was the response to the referendum? </b></p> <p>Downing Street said talks would continue with Madrid but that no solution would be imposed on Gibraltarians against their will. </p> <p>Mr Blair's official spokesman said the key questions were still: \"How do we ensure a more prosperous future for the people of Gibraltar? How do we resolve the real practical issues? And how do we work with the Spanish government to resolve those issues?\" </p> <p>Gustavo de Aristegui, Spain's then spokesman on foreign affairs, said the referendum had not been called by \"competent authorities\" and was \"not legally binding\".</p>",
  "<p>Daniel Libeskind is in his studio in Zurich, having flown in from New York for a day and night. He is unsure what day it is, and when we pop back to his office after a coffee, he forgets what floor his studio is on. It's a bit like being on screen with Woody Allen. </p> <p>Aside from the Zurich studio, Libeskind has offices in New York and Hong Kong. His career is clearly on some global trajectory. As well as the master-planning of Ground Zero in New York, he has new commissions for important building projects in Milan, Seoul and Hong Kong. He is busy building in Denver, San Francisco, Bern and Tel Aviv. He has just completed a boat-like and uncharacteristically low-profile Jewish Museum in Copenhagen. In the Zurich studio, he shows me a model of a military museum planned for the centre of born-again Dresden. We get to talk (Libeskind in his inimitable thousand-words-a-minute way) in-between client meetings. </p> <p>Libeskind's ability to concentrate intensely on one project for the time needed before switching to the next with equal enthusiasm is remarkable. Here is a successful architect firing on all cylinders, and very much on form. </p> <p>Not that you would have gleaned this from newspapers over the past fortnight. Instead, you will have read that the government turned down a funding application from the Victoria and Albert Museum to build his Spiral Gallery, dedicated to contemporary design. And you will have learned that there is trouble in New York, too. The architect's design for the 1,776ft Freedom Tower at Ground Zero has been taken over by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), successful commercial architects. Now Studio Libeskind is suing the developer, Larry Silverstein. Is the sky-rocketing Libeskind falling to earth, his dramatic, zig-zag designs in tow? \"You've got to have faith,\" he says. \"And patience, too. Lots of it. </p> <p>\"When you're a kid with artistic yearnings brought up in the Bronx, you don't get fed up too easily. It took 10 years to build the Jewish Museum in Berlin [his first building; overall, a critical success]. Nearly everybody said it would never happen. It was too crazy, too unrealistic. But it did happen. And now we've been asked to build an extension to the museum because the number of visitors is growing each year. </p> <p>\"The Spiral Gallery may happen, too. It is not dependent on government funding. The museum has raised many millions of pounds, and a benefactor might still come its way. We've revised the project to bring it up to date. There is a possibility it will happen, and there is the possibility it might not, but you have to believe in what might be. I'm not Candide, nor Dr Pangloss, but we know that faith moves mountains.\" </p> <p>And raises Manhattan towers? Libeskind proves keen to emphasise the positive here, too. \"SOM has taken over the design of the Freedom Tower, but we're in charge of the overall masterplan for Ground Zero. This includes the tower, but far more besides. We're dealing, simultaneously, with the commissioning and construction of 10 million sq ft of offices, the 9/11 memorial, entire new streets, a new park, seven storeys of infrastructure below ground, transportation, security ... It's like running a marathon several times over. I don't get to sleep when I'm in New York. Really. I'm living on adrenaline.\" He must be. It's getting on for two o'clock and he clearly hasn't had a chance to even think about lunch. </p> <p>\"This is a huge project,\" he continues, \"the rebirth, effectively, of Lower Manhattan. It involves so many players and will take several years to complete. We're in this for the long run. Our office is on Rector Street with a great view of Ground Zero, Federal Hall, the Hudson and the Statue of Liberty. Every time I look out of the window, I'm reminded of what I'm doing.\" </p> <p>So what is the problem between Libeskind and Silverstein, the Mr Big of New York's property world and lessee, from the Port Authority, of the World Trade Centre site? \"It's a straightforward legal issue,\" says Libeskind. \"Larry wanted us to reposition the tower. We wouldn't, and won't. He's been holding back our fees. We want to get paid. And that's it. It'll get solved and we'll carry on with planning Ground Zero.\" </p> <p>Planning, but not building. Libeskind admits: \"It's been hard to hand over the working design of Freedom Tower to another architect - although we're still a part of the team, and so is Larry. And, yes, I love the process of building. But maybe it's good for architects to have their egos kept in check once in a while. Anyway, we're building so much around the world, I can hardly complain.\" </p> <p>New York, though, is a very special case, and place, for Libeskind. This is where he came, by ship, aged 13, with his family from Lodz in Poland in 1959. The sight, and promises, of the Statue of Liberty, the experience of immigration procedures on Ellis Island, and the sheer drama of the anyone-can-make-it-here city, made indelible impressions on the budding architect. He is an American citizen, and proud of it. His twisting design for the Freedom Tower is a play on the stance of the nearby Statue of Liberty. He finds nothing corny in designing a building 1,776ft tall, nor in the decision to lay the foundation stone on July 4. </p> <p>\"Right now, the rest of the world confuses American notions of patriotism and nationhood with the actions of a specific administration,\" he argues. \"But the US is a democracy, and when a government is voted out, these humanist notions of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness continue.\" </p> <p>Libeskind still recalls the construction of the World Trade Centre in the late 1960s and early 1970s; at the time he was a student at the Cooper Union school of architecture in New York. \"I remember vividly the huge holes in the ground excavated for their foundations. Yamasaki's towers were exciting in terms of their sheer scale and daring, but they were never my favourite buildings. Most people only really expressed a fondness for them after their destruction. I found them pretty frightening, and the whole area around them a case of the classic windswept plaza. </p> <p>\"Now, for the worst of reasons, we have a chance to make this area really special - and this is happening even before any of us gets to build. There are more people living in Lower Manhattan now than before the terrorist attacks. That's faith for you. There's such a strong spirit here.\" </p> <p>So strong, in fact, that everyone seemed to have a view on how to redevelop the site. One difficulty for the architect has been the number of people who have a say in the redevelopment - \"everyone from federal, state and city governments to those who live and work here. Remember,\" he says, \"it was the people of New York who rejected the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's plan for the site. They said we want something incredible, not just more real estate.\" </p> <p>And of course, fascination with the site wasn't limited to the US. Libeskind points out that in the final two weeks of the competition to find a master-planner for Ground Zero, the official website had eight million hits. \"The level of global interest was amazing. But the press reported the story in a way that was all about the egos of duelling architects. And we were all caught up in the act. We had to address huge audiences through the media and on public stages. The press were writing about our clothes, our haircuts and glasses. It was nerve-wracking. </p> <p>\"Perhaps we were over-sensitive to criticism and maybe everyone got a little too hot under the collar. Now it has settled down. We have some great architects collaborating with us today, like Santiago Calatrava, who's designing the new subway station and interchange. You'll be able to see right up from the platforms several stories below pavement level to the 9/11 memorial, to the 70-storey Freedom Tower and to the sky above.\" </p> <p>The more Libeskind talks, the more keen he seems to deflect attention from the Freedom Tower. \"The foreign press seems obsessed with the Freedom Tower, as if it was the only thing going on here. In fact, we're trying to keep a huge juggling act in balance, with the tower as just one of the many balls in play. There will be several new cultural buildings here; sure, it would be great if we could design one of them. I remain optimistic. </p> <p>\"I'm also positive we'll end up with a part of New York that is very different to, for example, the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. That was crazy. Really good architects, like Renzo Piano, Jos\u00e9 Rafael Moneo and Arata Isozaki, were working there, yet you ended up with a cultural and commercial dead-end. The plan for Lower Manhattan is very different; it's very much a part of the old city, a new and exciting part, but it will have the spirit of New York written all over it. </p> <p>\"In the process,\" Libeskind concludes as the Dresden party arrives, \"you have to be prepared to be beaten up a little. But, this shouldn't shake your faith. And, even then, you can always punch back.\"</p>",

  "Twelve suspected terrorists who were arrested in a series of nationwide raids were today being questioned by police. <p>Officers said the men, who were all in their 20s and 30s, had been seized on suspicion of being concerned with the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. A thirteenth man arrested in the operation was released without charge.</p> <p>Scotland Yard, which led the operation, would not discuss whether it was linked to the seizure of computer files from al-Qaida suspects captured in Pakistan. However, a statement issued yesterday said the raids were part of a \"pre-planned, ongoing, intelligence-led operation\". </p> <p>\"[The] operation is part of continuing and extensive inquiries by police and the security service into alleged international terrorism,\" the statement said. </p> <p>The suspects - arrested in raids in north-west London, Bushey, in Hertfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire and Blackburn, Lancashire - were taken to Paddington Green police station, in central London, to be interviewed by officers from the Metropolitan police's anti-terrorist branch.</p> <p>Witnesses today described how armed officers had carried out the raids. In Blackburn, 40-year-old Ruth Lazell told how she had watched officers surround a gold Mercedes and arrest the two men in it.</p> <p>\"There were armed police officers telling us to go back inside the house, about 15 or 20 of them in all. They had their guns pointing at two Asian lads who were on the floor outside the car,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The officers put plastic bags around the lads' arms and legs, and then put what looked like white paper suits over the rest of them. Their hands were tied together and then they were taken away.\"</p> <p>She said she did not think the men were local, and added that her neighbours had never seen them before.</p> <p>In Luton, witnesses said a man was pulled from his car by seven armed policemen.</p> <p>Leigh Mayes, 70, who saw the operation from the window of his house, said officers carrying semi-automatic machine-guns held the man against his maroon hatchback for almost three hours while forensic teams carried out searches.</p> <p>Yasin Rehman, of the Luton Council of Mosques, said Luton's Muslim community was feeling persecuted by the second anti-terror raids in four months.</p> <p>\"What was the purpose of these raids and why were they carried out? Muslims have been targeted and their lives have been tarnished. From that point of view the community is concerned,\" Dr Rehman said.</p> <p>\"These raids are important if there is intelligence showing there are individuals in the community preaching hate. [But] there is a feeling in the community that they are being victimised.</p> <p>\"If these raids are successful and the police do find something, that is supportable. But in the last raids [in March this year] no-one was charged or convicted, and it gives people the feeling they are being targeted,\" he added.</p> <p>The arrests came as the prime minister, Tony Blair, came under pressure to elaborate on the nature of the terrorism threat to Britain.</p> <p>The US is on heightened alert following the seizure of files from the al-Qaida suspects captured in Pakistan, with the documents apparently mentioning potential targets for attack both in the US and Britain. </p> <p>However, while police in London are said to have spoken to branches of US banks in the capital, security on this side of the Atlantic has not been notably increased.</p> <p>Questions have been raised over the scale of the response ordered by Washington on Sunday after it was revealed that much of the information seized may have been gathered several years ago. </p> <p>Some have accused the US president, George Bush, of using terror threats to shore up his political position ahead of the US presidential election in November.</p> <p>The chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, Massoud Shadjareh, sounded a note of caution about the UK arrests, which he said were \"very worrying\" in their timing.</p> <p>\"We are extremely concerned about the timing of this, especially coming immediately after the increased need to heighten the security alert in the US because of the election, and also the day before the parliamentary human rights group publishes its report, which is critical of the Terrorism Act and the treatment of Belmarsh prisoners,\" he said.</p> <p>Three months ago, the Home Office revealed that fewer than one in five of those arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 had been charged with offences under the legislation.</p> <p>By May this year, 562 people had been arrested under the act since September 11 2001. The home secretary, David Blunkett, said 97 had been charged with and, of those, 14 had been convicted.</p> <p>A total of 280 people had been released without charge and with no further action being taken, Mr Blunkett said.</p>",
  "The father of a young bride murdered using a shotgun was today named for the first time as the main suspect in the case as detectives said they suspected someone could be sheltering him. <p>Terry Rodgers disappeared after his daughter, Chanel Taylor, 23, was found shot in the head seven weeks after marrying 22-year-old Lee Taylor. Mr Taylor found his wife's body at their terraced home in Huthwaite, north Nottinghamshire, on Friday at around 1pm. </p> <p>Police said today that Chanel's father, who was living with the newlyweds after his marriage broke up, was the prime suspect because he was the last person known to have been in the house with her. </p> <p>After an appeal by Mr Rodgers' 19-year-old son, Colt, for his father to contact police to help end the family's \"nightmare\", Detective Chief Inspector Paul Cottee of Nottinghamshire police said Mr Rodgers had been seen locally on two occasions since Saturday.</p> <p>Det Ch Insp Cottee, the man leading the inquiry, told a news conference there was a \"serious possibility\" someone was helping the 55-year-old. He advised anyone who may be helping doing so to contact the police. \"We are contacting people he knows, currently and in the past,\" he said. \"If you assist him, you will be prosecuted. </p> <p>\"It is a human instinct to help a friend by offering them protection and shelter; however this is a horrific crime. We have got a young girl who has tragically been killed and these people are committing a criminal offence if they are hiding him. </p> <p>\"We will leave no stone unturned to find him. He could be anywhere but we have got a local sighting, and he was born and bred locally.\"</p> <p>He repeated pleas for Mr Rodgers to give himself up.</p> <p>The two confirmed sightings of Mr Rodgers were in the Hucknall area of Nottingham, where his car was found abandoned on Saturday.</p> <p>Police admitted they did not know what the motive was for the killing of Chanel, a hairdresser. Det Ch Insp Cottee said: \"As far as we know, the relationship between Terry and Chanel was a good relationship. </p> <p>\"We are now working on the basis that Terry was in the house when Lee left for work that morning and, as such, Terry Rodgers is now the main suspect in this murder investigation.\" </p> <p>He said the former security man, who was known to police prior to the shooting, had recently sold his security business, though he was in no financial difficulty. Asked if he thought Mr Rodgers was suicidal, Det Ch Insp Cottee said he had no information about his state of mind. </p> <p>He warned the public not to approach Mr Rodgers as the murder weapon had not been recovered. Police believe the gun was being held illegally. </p> <p>Colt Rodgers, Chanel's brother, said in his statement: \"Over the past few days our lives have been turned upside down. Chanel's death has left so many unanswered questions.\"</p> <p>Urging his father to get in touch, he said: \"Dad, we need your help to make sense of this nightmare. I am trying to be strong, especially for Mum, but we are all devastated. </p> <p>\"We've always been close. It was only the other week we were all together sharing Chanel's big day. If you are watching or listening, we need you to come forward, for Chanel's sake and yours.\" </p> <p>Det Ch Insp Cottee said police had spoken to Lee Taylor. He said: \"As you can imagine, he is extremely distressed at the loss of his wife. He has been helpful in painting a picture of her and her relationship with her father.\"</p> <p>The officer would not discuss forensic evidence found at the scene but he said: \"We will do everything in our power to catch him and we are very confident that we will.\"</p>",
  "In some ways it is simply a case of supply and demand. We supply dead bodies, and then demand that society disposes of them. In the past, says Adrian Monaghan, a PhD student whose thesis is on the Sociology of Innovation - The Business of Body Disposal, there have been some innovative suggestions: encasing people in concrete, building huge mausoleum buildings, mass burials at sea and then, in 1874, the whacky suggestion from Sir Henry Thompson, which he learned from the Italians at a conference in Europe, of burning people. That one was taken up with gusto last century, and cremation is by the far the most common practice today. <p>But the sustainability of burial and body disposal has been put into sharper focus by the Home Office's consultation paper, Burial Law and Policy in the 21st Century. The consultation period was due to close on July 13, but the level of interest in the subject has led to an extention to the end of August.</p> <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, claims Monaghan, there was a limited but recognised interest for what were called earth to earth burials, where the body was placed in an eco-friendly casket that would decompose with the body quickly after burial. There is growing interest in a similar practice today with green burials. \"What we have in the UK now is green burial, and the rapid increase in green burial sites also suggests that people want to go ahead with a more green option. But the Home Office doesn't recognise the growing demand for it,\" he says.</p> <p>Monaghan says a long-term perspective has not been properly addressed. But what some people are dreaming up for the dead might make your blood run cold. Would you like to be frozen with liquid nitrogen and then put through a vibrating process so that you shatter into tiny pieces or plastinated by Gunther Von Hagens to become an exhibit in his Body Worlds \"art\" show? If you decide on the latter, everyone has a chance to admire your guts.</p> <p>Monaghan's research was funded by Brunel University.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Send your buriel ideas to Fiona.pembroke@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jude Law</strong> has been tipped to play Ian Curtis in a biopic of the late Joy Division frontman. The independent American production will be based on Touching From a Distance, the 1995 memoir by Deborah Curtis, the singer's widow. </p> <p>Plagued by epilepsy and bouts of depression, Manchester-born Curtis committed suicide in 1980 on the eve of a US tour. Yesterday bassist Peter Hook said that Law was \"not a bad choice\", but added that he would have preferred to see Sean Harris reprise the role. Despite lacking Law's star wattage, Harris was commended for his edgy, combative performance as Curtis in Michael Winterbottom's 2002 picture 24-Hour Party People.</p> <p>Commenting on the reports, however, the film's producer Todd Eckert told the Guardian: \"Jude is an exceptionally gifted actor, but I'm afraid the role of Ian has not yet been determined.\"</p> <p> <strong>Halle Berry</strong> and Sharon Stone braved a spectacular summer thunderstorm to attend the UK premiere of Catwoman in London last night. \"I'm always blown away when I come to London,\" the star quipped to reporters outside the cinema in Leicester Square.

  "<p>\"The past couple of years, Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs has gotten nothing but roses and kisses from the public and the media. But a feud between Apple and RealNetworks over music downloads is exposing Jobs' tragic flaw. Amazingly, he seems to be making the same devastating mistakes with the iPod that he made with the Mac 20 years ago.\" writes Kevin Maney in his Wednesday column in <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2004-08-03-jobs_x.htm\">USA Today</a>.</p> <p>Maney says Avram Miller, a tech investor and former vice president at Intel, compares Apple to Singapore. \"You know Singapore: autocratic, insular, elegantly engineered, repressively controlled \u2014 and destined to never amount to more than a small but interesting dot on the world map.\"</p> <p><strong>Comment:</strong> It's an old tale, but amusingly told. However, it isn't true to say that Jobs refused to license the Mac OS in 1985 (which was when Gates wrote to Apple, recommending and offering to support licensing as a way to make Mac OS a standard). Jobs had no real power at Apple once the Mac had flopped: John Sculley was the CEO, and it was Sculley who decided against licensing.</p> <p>To be specific, Jobs was booted out of Apple on May 24, 1985 and the Gates memo was sent on June 25.</p> <p>Of course, Jobs would certainly have made the same mistake, and it was Jobs who -- after returning to Apple in the 90s -- got rid of the Mac \"cloners\" that Gil Amelio had belatedly allowed in.

  "Spain yesterday accused the British government of lacking \"self-control\" and \"sensitivity\" as Gibraltar, with the help of the Royal Navy and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, prepared to celebrate today's 300th anniversary of the expulsion of its Spanish population. <p>As Gibraltarians held a street party last night, Spain's Socialist foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, said Mr Hoon's visit was merely the latest in a series of British blunders over the Rock. </p> <p>\"It is very strange that, in the European Union of the 21st century, one member state should be celebrating the military occupation of part of another member state,\" Mr Moratinos wrote in El Pa\u00eds newspaper. </p> <p>He complained of Britain's \"clear lack of sensitivity\" in permitting a visit to Gibraltar by Princess Anne and allowing another visit by the submarine HMS Tireless, which sparked a huge row when it was repaired there several years ago. </p> <p>The frigate HMS Grafton became the first Royal Navy vessel to fire a 21-gun salute in Gibraltar's harbour for 54 years when it arrived at the weekend. This has also riled Spain - which wants a return of the sovereignty lost in 1704. </p> <p>Mr Moratinos said the British government \"should have made some gesture\" to the descendants of those who fled, or were expelled by, the Anglo-Dutch forces who stormed Gibraltar. </p> <p>The loss of the region's main port had, Mr Moratinos said, condemned locals to centuries of poverty and had blighted the local economy ever since. </p> <p>The reaction of the Spanish government to the anniversary party has been restrained compared with that of some politicians, who have accused Britain of behaving \"like a 17th-century colonial power\", according to one senior Socialist, and of \"philofascism\", according to a local communist. </p> <p>Gibraltar's first minister, Peter Caruana, meanwhile, has further irritated Spain by calling its reaction \"impertinent\" and telling Madrid the anniversary celebrations were \"none of their business\". </p> <p>While a spokesman for the Foreign Office told Spanish journalists their government was indulging in \"childlike\" behaviour, the US cancelled a visit by navy vessel USS McFaul, saying it did not want to offend Spain. </p> <p>The slowly snowballing affair has proved an embarrassment for the Socialist prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, who admitted that the lowest point of his first 100 days in government was the visit of HMS Tireless. </p> <p>Rightwing newspapers and the conservative opposition in Spain have whipped up popular outrage at the celebrations, while the government has tried to dampen the con troversy. Mr Moratinos yesterday went much further than his predecessors in recognising that Spain needs to win over Gibraltarians if it is to have any hope of regaining sovereignty over the territory. \"Negotiations about sovereignty cannot be carried out properly in an atmosphere of confrontation, even if this is only because the Gibraltarians themselves should take part,\" he said. </p> <p>Previous Spanish governments have imposed rigorous police controls at the Gibraltar border so that it takes hours to enter or leave. That may help to explain why, when asked in a referendum in 2002 whether they supported the government's plans to negotiate shared sovereignty between Spain and Britain, 99% of its 18,000 voters said no. </p> <p>Spain's political right has gloated over Mr Zapatero's difficulties, claiming Britain would never have been so heavy-handed had the conservative ex-prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, a friend of Tony Blair, still been in power. </p> <p>Mr Aznar's People's party yesterday taunted Mr Zapatero, who has shifted Spain's allegiance towards France and Germany, over his inability to have a \"normal, logical and constructive\" relationship with the Blair government. </p> <p>There have also been rumours, emanating from the Spanish foreign ministry, that Britain has decided to use the Gibraltar celebrations to snub Mr Zapatero pulling Spain's troops out of Iraq.</p>",
  "Think pink, or purple, or starfish-shaped: the time has come for anyone with dreams of building a truly radical country house. Forget classical columns and a nice gravelled drive: something spangly and blobby like the Selfridges building in Birmingham, something jaunty like Will Alsop's Peckham Library, or even something shiny and silvery like Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim is more likely to win planning permission. <p>The government yesterday announced the drastic tightening up of a planning guideline intended to promote \"exceptional quality\", but which has been blamed for scattering the countryside with neo-Georgian monstrosities. The measure is not being entirely scrapped, as many architects had feared. The revised guideline says new buildings will be allowed in the countryside if they are \"truly outstanding and groundbreaking\" in design and construction. </p> <p>The news was greeted with relief by architects, who may earn most of their livings from office blocks and attic conversions, but whose dream client has an untrammelled imagination, rolling acres, infinitely deep pockets and a sympathetic planning authority. </p> <p>The Royal Institute of British Architects, which was expecting the measure to be abolished, was delighted. George Ferguson, the president of Riba, welcomed \"a brave and vital endorsement by government of the value of excellence in design\". Although better known as a champion of urban development - he has backed a movement dubbed New Urbanism - he said the country house was one of Britain's most significant architectural traditions. \"The country house has through the ages been one of the defining elements of our architectural and social history,\" he said. \"It has embraced all styles and types, and should continue to be characterised by its excellence rather than an adherence to any one architectural movement.\" </p> <p>Lord Foster, whose curvaceous \"Erotic Gherkin\" now dominates the London skyline, and who recently created the even blobbier Chesa Futura, a cheese football-shaped apartment complex on the slopes above St Moritz, said: \"It is wonderful news that the government has recognised the role that good design can play in shaping the way we build in the countryside. This is a very progressive initiative.\" </p> <p>The government's announcement may mean curtains for fibreglass corinthian columns, however. The planning measure, introduced by former environment secretary John Gummer in 1997, and nicknamed \"Gummer's Law\", rapidly became seen as a developer's greenfield charter. It was always intended to confine permission for new country houses to applications of \"exceptional quality\", but resulted in a rash of buildings more like sets for Footballers' Wives. </p> <p>Landowners including Owen Inskip, whose 18th century-style mansion is now rising in the Cotswolds, or the many clients eager for neo-classical houses by Robert Adam, succeeded in convincing some local authorities that traditional brick and stone construction, tiled roofs, pillared porches, and sash windows constituted \"exceptional quality\". </p> <p>The latest modern country house to be granted planning permission, St John's House in Oxfordshire, is determinedly and unusually modern, designed by Adrian James with curved ground floor openings which reminded some of the hobbits' houses in The Lord of the Rings. </p> <p>But most successful applications have been far more traditional. The first completed under Gummer's Law was Wootton Hall in Staffordshire, a 12,000sq ft mansion designed by Digby Harris for the brewery heir John Greenall, which includes a dome, neo-Palladian ground floor, raised terrace, and a curved colonnade which would not disgrace a Regency terrace in Cheltenham. </p> <p>Viscount Rothermere, of the newspaper dynasty, has just moved into a \u00a340m resolutely traditional house by Quinlan Terry in Dorset, and millionaire Wafic Said's new home in Oxfordshire incorporates a portico with six-metre (20ft) pillars. The largest house under construction in Britain, Hamilton Palace in Sussex, was still only half built when its controversial owner, the property developer Nicholas van Hoogstraten, was jailed. He originally sketched out the design for it himself on a paper napkin, based on a combination of Versailles and Buckingham Palace. Mr Hoogstraten's conviction for manslaughter was quashed in December 2003, but it is uncertain whether the house will ever be finished: if it is, he intends it to incorporate his own mausoleum. </p> <p>The revised planning provision demands \"the highest standards of architecture... significant enhancement of its immediate setting, and sensitivity to the defining characteristics of the local area\". The planning minister, Keith Hill, is also keen to encourage experimental building, including prefabricated pods. </p> <p>Since the V&amp;A is unlikely ever to afford to build Daniel Libeskind's Spiral as a museum extension, and Will Alsop's blob-shaped \"Fourth Grace\" has just been turned down for Liverpool's waterfront, perhaps both could be recycled as country houses: plenty of room for the labradors, and no need to worry about muddy wellies.</p>",
  "Police urgently appealed for information yesterday about the father of a young bride who was found shot dead in her home less than two months after her wedding. <p>Terry Rodgers, 55, had moved into his daughter Chanel's home a few weeks after giving her away at her wedding. He has not been seen since last Friday, the day Chanel's body was discovered by her husband, Lee Taylor.</p> <p>The public was warned not to approach him, particularly as the gun used to kill the 23-year-old has not been found. Superintendent Stuart Wright of Nottinghamshire police, who is leading the murder inquiry, said concern was also growing about the wellbeing of the missing man.</p> <p>\"It's crucial for us to speak to Terry Rodgers, who despite widespread media coverage has not come forward,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This is his daughter who has died and only by gaining vital information which pieces together what happened and why she was killed can her family hope to come to terms with what has happened.\"</p> <p>Police across the country have been given Mr Rodgers' description, while specially trained officers and relatives are comforting Mr Taylor, 22. A statement issued on his behalf last night said: \"We were a newly married couple and I am devastated.</p> <p>\"We were very happy and looking forward to a long life together. Tragically, this will no longer happen. I am in a complete state of shock and request that my family and I be left alone to grieve.\"</p> <p>Mr Taylor discovered his wife's body at their home in Huthwaite, near Sutton-in-Ashfield, at around 1pm on Friday.

Friends said she had become anxious and withdrawn.</p> <p>One, who did not want to be named, said Chanel had been bubbly and happy when she lived with her mother, Anne, and worked as a trainee in a salon. But four years ago her father, who had lived away for a while, moved back into the family home.</p> <p>Huthwaite residents left their houses seven weeks ago to watch as the bride and her father were taken to her wedding by vintage car.</p> <p>Police gave few details of Mr Rodgers' relationship with Chanel at a news conference in the Nottinghamshire force's HQ, but said the rest of the family were distraught.</p> <p>Supt Wright said: \"I personally saw Lee on the night of the murder and he couldn't come to terms with what has happened, and said it felt like this had happened to someone else.</p> <p>\"The tragic thing is that this has happened to Lee, but of course it is not just Lee; it has affected the whole of Chanel's family and friends, in particu lar her mother and her two brothers.

  "The home secretary, David Blunkett, must end the internment of foreign terrorism suspects, a committee of senior MPs warned today. <p>Criticising the emergency counter-terrorism powers the home secretary granted himself in the wake of September 11, parliament's joint committee on human rights said it was a \"matter of urgency\" that an alternative to the indefinite detention of such suspects be found.</p> <p>The committee also fired a shot across the bows of Mr Blunkett's leaked plans - revealed in the Guardian today - to bring in a new offence of \"acts preparatory to terrorism\", saying it was unconvinced of the need for such a measure.</p> <p>Instead its report suggests that terrorism could become an \"aggravating factor\" in existing offences to cover prosecutions and urges that the burden of proof remain at a level \"beyond reasonable doubt\".</p> <p>The committee, made up of six MPs and six peers, also found that Britain's current opting out of existing European human rights legislation due to terrorism concerns had a \"corrosive\" effect, and that the powers were being used \"disproportionately\" against Britain's Muslim community.</p> <p>There was \"discrimination inherent\" in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which became law within weeks of the attacks on the World Trade Centre, it said. </p> <p>Its report states: \"There is mounting evidence that the powers under the Terrorism Act are being used disproportionately against members of the Muslim community in the UK.\"</p> <p>Although the findings will not be binding on the home secretary, the report says laws drawn up Mr Blunkett risked the courts admitting evidence obtained from the torture of suspected terrorists. </p> <p>The law passed in 2001 allows foreign nationals who are suspected international terrorists to be interned indefinitely. Britain had to derogate - or opt out - from part of the European convention on human rights to allow this imprisonment without trial to take place. </p> <p>Today's report, published a day after 13 further suspects were arrested in England using anti-terrorism powers, said: \"The committee considers that long-term derogation from human rights obligations have a corrosive effect on the culture of respect for human rights. </p> <p>\"If the threat from international terrorism is to continue for the foreseeable future, the committee considers that an alternative way must be found to deal with that threat without derogating indefinitely from important human rights considerations.\" </p> <p>The report raises concerns that there were inadequate safeguards on the internment process, after one detainee was released after 15 months in jail. </p> <p>But the members backed several ideas, including that information obtained from telephone taps and other intercepted information such as email should be allowed as evidence in court. </p> <p>They also said Mr Blunkett's proposals for civil orders to restrict the activities of people linked to terrorism should be considered, \"including access to an independent judicial determination and a test of strict necessity\". </p> <p>Mr Blunkett's internment powers should be \"replaced as a matter of urgency by measures which do not include indefinite administrative detention\", the report adds. </p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"We welcome all responses to the discussion paper we published in February and we will consider the report carefully. </p> <p>\"But we are not able to comment on the content of the report at this stage.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for civil rights group Liberty said: \"This report has taken a long, hard look at sensible ways in which one can combat the terrorist threat and decided that the current government approach is almost certainly counter-productive. </p> <p>\"The Americans have begun to realise that they cannot hold the Guant\u00e1namo detainees indefinitely. </p> <p>\"Surely the British government can also realise that they must release the detainees they hold, or put them on trial?\" </p> <p><b>Evidence obtained after torture</b></p> <p>There were no exceptions when courts would be justified to accept evidence obtained from torture, the report said. </p> <p>The court which deals with detainees' cases, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), indicated last October that it would admit evidence obtained from such means, the members noted. </p> <p>Human rights groups fear suspects are being interned in the UK on the basis of confessions extracted by alleged torture of other detainees, such as those in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p>\"There is a significant risk of the UK being in breach of its international human rights obligations if SIAC or any other court were to admit evidence which has been obtained by torture,\" the 90-page report finds.</p> <p>SIAC hearings are largely held in secret, with detainees and their lawyers prohibited from seeing sensitive evidence against them. </p> <p>Instead, the government appoints \"special advocates\" - lawyers who have been vetted by the security services - to read the evidence and appear on the detainees' behalf. </p> <p>The special advocates are not allowed any contact with the detainee or their legal team once he or she has seen the secret evidence. </p> <p>Today's report says there were \"legitimate concerns about the appearance of fairness of the process\" because special advocates are appointed by the attorney general, the government's senior law officer, who also appears before SIAC representing the home secretary. </p> <p>The members agreed with a committee of privy counsellors, led by Lord Newton, which said in December that the law should be changed so that it applied equally to Britons rather than only foreigners. </p> <p>And extended use of \"overt\" surveillance in terrorism cases would be preferable to locking people up without trial, today's report added. </p> <p>On phone tap evidence in court, the members said: \"We conclude that the case for relaxing the absolute ban on the use of intercept evidence is overwhelming.\"</p> <p><b>Plan to tighten terror laws</b></p> <p>Asked about the Guardian's story that Mr Blunkett was considering bringing in a new terrorism offence, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, this morning told the BBC: \"We have to recognise that we live in uncertain times. </p> <p>\"And that means that, as Liberals, sometimes we have to accept things which in normal circumstances we would be very uncomfortable with. </p> <p>\"I want to see the detail, but I do recognise that, as we try and tackle this very difficult situation with terrorism, there will be occasions when we do need to extend powers.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I want to monitor that and make sure it is done properly but the home secretary will have our support if he can make a strong case for new measures to tackle terrorism.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett must at some point renew the powers enacted in the 2001 Act, which expire in 2006.</p>",
  "<b> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday August 5 2004</b> <br> In the article below, the writer, having referred to the matter of gay people in the armed forces, notes that \"former admiral of the fleet, Peter Hill-Norton, has gone a little quiet on the subject ...\" That is because he died in May this year.      It's a British military tradition that has become as much a part of our plucky island history as the Edinburgh Tattoo. Politicians announce impertinently that they intend to stop spending with quite such orgiastic indulgence on our armed services. Cue spluttering outrage from retired brigadiers and armchair generals peppering the pages of the Daily Telegraph, the Times and the Daily Mail with all the shrill ferocity of a Gatling gun. <p>Touchingly predictable, the armchair battalion has stirred itself once again in the wake of last month's defence spending review. In one day alone last week, the letters column of the Daily Telegraph featured Lt Gen Sir Robert Richardson (Royal Scots, retd), Major Philip Sturtivant (\"a retiree of 30 years of commissioned service in a senior British infantry regiment\") and Lt Cdr Peter Burgess RN, all heaping scorn on the government's modest proposals for some regimental rationalisations. </p> <p>\"Even if you have never heard of past triumphs such as the defence of Quatre Bras the day before Waterloo,\" a Telegraph leader-writer wittered weepily, \"you somehow have a sense of them when, say, the Black Watch is mentioned.\" (It's possible, of course, that neither the defence of Quatre Bras, or indeed the Black Watch itself, are much talked about on the walkways of the housing estates which remain the prime recruiting ground for the armed services.) </p> <p>Commander Richard Ibbotson, who runs the Britannia Royal Naval Training College at Dartmouth, gave an interview in which it was heartwarmingly revealed that Dartmouth may have been saved from the \"axe\". We were solemnly reminded that Prince Philip, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York and George VI all trained there. (No doubt they each benefited from the stern example of Cdr Ibbotson's predecessor Captain Foley. He forbade piano-playing by cadets because it encouraged effeminacy.) </p> <p>Finally, Earl Spencer joined the fray. We expect \"the army to do so much and all on no money\", he told the Sunday Times plaintively last weekend. </p> <p>Let's be clear. The \"no money\" on which our armed services struggle by, and to which Earl Spencer refers, is \u00a329.7bn a year. And the spending review confirmed that this will rise by 1.4% above inflation, every year for five years, to \u00a333.4bn. To poor old Lord Spencer, serendipitously worth \u00a3100m by virtue of having been born, this may not sound much. But to every taxpayer it's \u00a31,000 a year. </p> <p>The loss of a historic cap badge, or even a historic parade ground, might be an emotional disappointment to some old soldiers and their friends. But if we had legions of retired doctors clinging on to cottage hospitals, retired teachers calling for the return of slide rules or retired economists demanding we bring back the groat, we'd laugh. And if public and politicians are entitled to no view about what we spend on defence, the strategic advice the nation has received from the armed services themselves over the years has hardly been impeccable. </p> <p>Until late in the 19th century, admirals crossly defended wooden hulls and sniffed at steam vessels. In 1916, Kitchener dismissed the tank as a \"pretty mechanical toy\". Two decades later the army was still clinging sentimentally to the horse. Retired Brigadier Ernest Makins, Tory MP for Knutsford, told the House of Commons furiously in 1934, and to warm acclaim: \"There must be no tinkering with the cavalry.\" </p> <p>Happily for Makins, the master general of ordnance, Sir Ronald Charles, agreed. For much of the mid-1930s, the army continued to spend four times as much on forage for horses as it did on fuel. (Sir Ronald's other claim to posterity? His firmly expressed view that \"There is no likelihood of war in our lifetime.\") </p> <p>Happily, it was Denis Healey who finally brought the services to heel. As he planned to streamline our capability east of Suez, it was a little more difficult for serving officers to rubbish a former soldier mentioned in despatches at Anzio. But even Healey failed to see off the armchair doom-mongers. </p> <p>Just five years ago, the bathchair brigadiers had another opportunity to share their wisdom after the European court impertinently obliged Britain to stop throwing lesbians and gay men out of the armed services. </p> <p>Money didn't matter then either. Even if it cost \u00a31.5m to train a fighter pilot, he was automatically shown the door the moment it turned out he was gay. Thousands of individuals had their lives blighted by this nonsense. (One of its more shameful protectors was former defence secretary Michael Portillo.) </p> <p>If gays and lesbians were allowed in the services, ran the argument, then when the shells started falling, the sergeant would be too busy pleasuring the corporal to give the order to return fire. Britain's fabled \"military operational effectiveness\" would be fatally undermined by having gays on the front line. Leading the defence of the last trench against homosexuals was retired General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley. As he put it in 1999: \"This decision will strike at morale and discipline. Comadeship is a binding factor. Sexual squabbles will be disruptive; perhaps fatally so.\" </p> <p>There's sad news for Sir Anthony. We've just fought a war in Iraq. A number of lesbians and gay men have served openly on the front line for the first time. And you can bet a dime to a dollar that if there had been one instance of compromised military operational effectiveness, we'd have heard about it all over the pages of the Daily Mail, the Times and the Daily Telegraph - and from Sir Anthony - by now. </p> <p>Incidentally, one of Sir Anthony's most prolix allies on the issue, former admiral of the fleet Peter Hill-Norton, has gone a little quiet on the subject too. But then, in the intervening years, Lord Hill-Norton has also accused the Ministry of Defence of covering up the existence of UFOs. </p> <p><b>French aid for London's Olympic bid</b></p> <p>I don't pretend to understand the politics of international sport. But the appointment of Lord Coe, William Hague's former chief of staff, to lead London's 2012 Olympic bid rather smacked of someone thinking that we weren't likely to succeed. </p> <p>Perhaps there's some happier news for Lord Coe at last. Accor Hotels are now supporting the French bid to win the games for Paris. Just weeks ago, I stayed at a pretty Accor Hotel in the French capital myself. The Hotel Scribe's website was illustrated with a series of attractive photos, including one of a gym. But oh-la-la. When I arrived, there was no gym at all. </p> <p>Accor explained most helpfully that the photograph was merely \" indicatif \" of a quality hotel. Perhaps the stunning pictures of stadia, velodrome and swimming pools in the Accor-sponsored Olympic bid packs for Paris will turn out to be merely \" indicatif \" too.</p>",
  "<p>He's a policeman and he doesn't like these newcomers. Since they came along, he thinks there have been fewer jobs for your ordinary working man. They were supposed to make life easier for us, do all the menial jobs, but in fact they take away the dignity of an honest day's graft. More than that, he doesn't trust them.</p> <p> They don't think like us, they have no morals; if he sees one running down the street with a handbag, he assumes it's stolen. He uses a derogative, slang term - \"canner\" - to address them. And he definitely wouldn't let one look after his kids.</p> <p>He is Will Smith in the blockbuster I, Robot. \"They\" are the robots, though you wouldn't be missing the point to see a connection between the way Smith's character, Detective Del Spooner, regards robots and the way Enoch Powell, for instance, thought about immigrants. </p> <p>In a revealing exchange, Spooner confronts the Bill Gates figure who runs the monopoly which sells the robots. Spooner sarcastically proposes a new advertising campaign in which a carpenter lovingly crafts a beautiful chair. Cut to a robot who makes a chair that's twice as good in half the time. \"The slogan,\" he suggests triumphantly, \"could be 'US Robotics: Shitting on the little guy'.\"</p> <p>The magnate suggests the detective's prejudice has led him into an irrational belief that the robots are criminals. \"I suspect,\" he declares haughtily, \"you just don't like their kind.\"</p> <p>I, Robot is not, in essence, a reactionary or rightwing film. But it does tap into a set of concerns recently raised by - among others - the English writer Michael Collins in his book The Likes of Us: \"Working class whites in poor areas ... believe they have been neglected and ghettoised, their views ignored.\" </p> <p>Spooner feels that he's being left behind as society blindly buys into a vision of the world of which he is deeply distrustful.He believes robots are not only economically bad for the working class, but also suspects the newcomers will in time attempt to seize political control. It turns out he's right about the robots (but for the wrong reasons). </p> <p>The paranoia and prejudice that Spooner displays is a placeholder for real social prejudices; against immigrants, against the poor, against those of other religions. It's part of a wave of social paranoia playing as backdrop to the summer's cinema schedules.</p> <p>An almost comical example is M Night Shyamalan's The Village, set in a very non-specific New England hamlet, where the settlers are haunted by Those Of Whom We Do Not Speak. TOWWDNS live in the woods surrounding the village, detest anyone strolling into their territory and respond with terrifying raids into the village each time the uneasy truce is broken. </p> <p>Lest it were unclear that TOWWDNS are The Poor Who We Do Not See Much of Round Here Thanks Be to God, the village elders take every opportunity to remind the young folk that they came to the village to escape \"The Towns\", where drunkenness, violence and vice are rife. The whole thing is a period-horror vision - and at times, satire - of the gated communities into which the fearful rich retreat.</p> <p>On similar territory, the Stepford Wives is an open satire on the desire of the middle classes to escape from the city hurly-burly into closed communities where no harm or unpleasantness may be visited upon them. Elsewhere, Shaun of the Dead works on the assumption that the suburban working classes are so zombified already that if they actually became the undead, the rest of us would barely notice the difference.</p> <p>The joke is tellingly short-circuited at the end, when a newscast reveals that the brain-dead zombies are \"perfectly adapted to work in the service industry\" over footage of a lumbering hulk pushing supermarket trollies.</p> <p>It's a commonplace that you can track US foreign policy since the 1960s through the baddies in Star Trek; after the monolithic confrontation with the \"Russian\" Klingons comes a period of rapprochement, while the \"Chinese\" Romulans emerge as the new threat, but one more tractable and less predictable. </p> <p>Films of all stripes in the cold war era, from Them! to The Manchurian Candidate, played on, and with, fears of communist witch-hunts, often from both sides simultaneously. Be afraid: there are reds under the bed, and be afraid: the G-men think you're a red and they're coming to get you. </p> <p>It's another commonplace to attribute all changes in behaviour since September 11 2001 to the shockwaves spilling out from the terrorist attacks. So is this creeping paranoia about Those of Whom We Do Not Speak indicative of America's half-unspoken fear of terrorists, especially Muslims? Perhaps, but the frequency with which the threat is explicitly presented as the poor, the criminal or the servile suggests another worry: class. Will our servants rise up against us? asks I, Robot. Can we escape from the criminal elements in our cities?, frets The Village.</p> <p>What's significant is how little reflection the films make on the social concerns of their protagonists. The Village, after several twists, accepts that the settlers will continue to live apart from mainstream society, neither returning to the towns nor confronting the threat just beyond their borders. Nor does I, Robot judge its hero too harshly. Smith's character has personal reasons for his prejudices, which he is in any case willing to set aside when the evidence is against them.</p> <p>So I, Robot is not a simple scare story. It has all the elements of ethical thinking that made Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics stories so successful. Can a simple utilitarian scheme generate an all-encompassing moral framework for behaviour? Is there any true morality without freedom of conscience? It also does a reasonable job of alluding to the many possible conclusions Asimov envisaged. As a series of thought exercises, it is a film which is likely to be underestimated, and its riffing on immigrant paranoia is far from black-and-white. </p> <p>By the film's closing reel, the real enemy is revealed not to be a disgruntled underclass, but a well-intentioned ruling class, who apply too keenly Cromwellian paternalistic principles of subduing freedom in favour of welfare; a clear nod to libertarian concerns about the post-9/11 use of \"security\" as a catch-all excuse for authoritarian government.</p> <p>Steven Spielberg says as much of his own immigrant drama, The Terminal, which tells the (almost true) story of a man stranded at an airport after his country of origin ceases to exist. \"The Terminal,\" he says, \"is really an immigrant's tale. In some ways we have lost sight of the immigrant's plight because security is more intense than ever before, and justifiably so.\" </p> <p>So what can we take away from these movies, which highlight social concerns and then offer no resolution? I, Robot's Detective Spooner is guided in his investigations by a pre-recorded hologram of the man whose murder he is investigating, a prominent robot scientist. \"My responses are limited,\" the programme repeats whenever Spooner asks something which it is not equipped to answer. \"You have to ask the right questions.\"</p> <p>In the end it doesn;t much matter what Spielberg or anyone else in Hollywood personally think about crime, immigration, or security. It is that these worries in the real world - as evidenced in the UK by the rise of Ukip and the BNP, or by Michael Collins' book, and in the US by public acceptance of draconian \"security measures\" and reduced tolerance of \"unpatriotic\" talk - are filtering into Hollywood storylines. </p> <p>Sometimes the questions are more important than the answers. On this evidence Hollywood is asking the right questions.</p>",
  "Pakistan has detained an al-Qaida suspect with a multimillion dollar bounty on his head after a string of arrests in recent days, the interior minister said yesterday. <p>\"We have arrested in the past 24 hours another two people of African origin who in our view have links to al-Qaida,\" Faisal Saleh Hayat told Reuters. \"Before that another person was arrested who has a multimillion dollar bounty on his head.\" He did not identify the man. </p> <p>The two foreigners were allegedly linked to al-Qaida suspects whose earlier arrests prompted fears of a plot to attack financial institutions in the United States. The first arrest was on Monday night, when authorities captured a foreign suspect along with two Pakistanis who were travelling to the eastern city of Lahore, intelligence officials said. </p> <p>Another man was arrested at a bus station in Hafizabad, near Lahore, on Sunday. Police said he gave his name as Juma Ibrahim and claimed to be in the town on business. </p> <p>\"He first said he was from Yemen but later changed his statement to say he was Egyptian,\" an intelligence official told Reuters. \"We are still checking his nationality. He does not have a passport.\" </p> <p>The official linked the two foreigners to other al-Qaida suspects detained recently, including a computer expert identified as Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan. </p> <p>Information obtained from Mr Khan and from Ahmed Ghailani, a Tanzanian captured after a gun battle on July 25, was one of the main factors that prompted the US to warn of possible al-Qaida attacks on the World Bank headquarters, the New York Stock Exchange and three other buildings. </p> <p>Emails and other computer data seized by Pakistani authorities during the arrests indicated that militants had carried out detailed reconnaissance of the buildings over several years. </p> <p>Mr Ghailani, who had a $5m (\u00a32.7m) bounty on his head, had been sought by the US for his role in the bombings of two US embassies in Africa in 1998 that killed 224 people. </p> <p>Pakistan also announced yesterday that a police con-stable usually assigned to security duty along routes where VIPs were travelling had been arrested on suspicion of giving information to militants. </p> <p>Concern about the safety of travelling VIPs was heightened last week by a suicide bombing that targeted prime minister-designate Shaukat Aziz while on the campaign trail in Punjab. Mr Aziz survived but at least nine people died in the attack, which was claimed by a group allegedly linked to al-Qaida.</p>",
  "US officials yesterday insisted they were right to raise the alert over a potential terrorist attack against a US financial target, despite the fact that much of the information that prompted the warning was years old. <p>During a day of claims of political motives in the handling of the alert, a senior Bush administration official told the New York Times that the cache of al-Qaida surveillance material captured in Pakistan contained photographs taken last January of financial centres in New York and Washington. </p> <p>Earlier, Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, conceded that almost all the evidence found on computer files seized recently in Pakistan pointed to al-Qaida surveillance of key financial establishments that pre-dated September 11 2001. </p> <p>He said that some of the information had been updated as recently as January, but added there was \"no evidence\" of more recent surveillance. That did not mean there was no imminent threat, he argued, because of al-Qaida's reputation for long-term planning. </p> <p>\"I would point out that this is the most significant, detailed piece of information about any particular region that we've come across in a long, long time, perhaps ever,\" he said. </p> <p>The Washington Post yesterday quoted a \"senior law enforcement official\" as questioning the motivation behind the alert declared on Sunday of a possible attack on financial centres in New York, Newark and Washington. </p> <p>\"There is nothing right now that we're hearing that is new,\" the official said. \"Why did we go to this level?\" </p> <p>Mr Ridge rejected suggestions that the high alert was politically motivated. \"We don't do politics in the department of homeland security,\" he said. </p> <p>His claim there was no evidence of recent surveillance directly contradicted an earlier intelligence briefing to reporters suggesting the surveillance of targets \"probably continues even today\". </p> <p>A US intelligence official stuck by that claim yesterday. \"There is reason to believe it [the surveillance] continues,\" the official said, adding that evidence for al-Qaida preparations came from many sources. </p> <p>\"There are multiple streams of reporting discussing potential attacks. The information at the briefing [on the Pakistan findings] is just another piece of puzzle that fits into streams of reporting,\" the official said. </p> <p>\"Some of the information is pre-9/11, but remember that with the [Kenya and Tanzania] embassy bombings in '98, the casing of the embassies took place in 1993 and it was approved in 1994 by Bin Laden, and the attack only happened in '98. This is a very methodical, patient organisation.\" </p> <p>According to a former senior CIA official, some of the corroborating evidence came from British intelligence who had captured an al-Qaida suspect who claimed that an attack would take place in the US two months before the US presidential election. </p> <p>That would coincide with the Republican convention in New York at the end of August and the beginning of September. </p> <p>The alerts were triggered by the arrests of the al-Qaida computer expert Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian wanted for the 1998 bombings in East Africa.</p>",
  "<p>Hold on tight, it is going to be a bumpy ride! Carnesky's Ghost Train lasts only 10 minutes, but it spans centuries of European culture and the experience of women as daughters, lovers and survivors of the Holocaust, emigration and modern day sex slavery. </p> <p>The great beauty of Carnesky's Ghost Train - and it is a shabby, faded, ornate, fairground beauty, like an exquisite woman past her prime - is that you can see as much or as little in it as you want. It offers a looking glass into a secret, dark world where ghostly Rapunzels let down their hair, a woman plunges her hands through glass, a finger beckons you towards disaster and the sound of wailing sirens. </p> <p>On one hand, it is merely a thoroughly enjoyable and superior fairground ride -quite the spookiest and most magical ghost train you'll ever experience, and one that the kids will find a real thrill. On the other, it is an artful theatrical installation that combines all the fun of the fair with a serious and very adult meditation on eastern European heritage. Even in its brevity it manages to touch on the haunting pain of real experiences in which grotesque fairytale meets 19th- and 20th-century history head on. </p> <p>After purchasing a ticket from the booth, you are directed towards the train and ordered into place by a gun-toting, tutu-wearing guard. It is impossible not to be reminded of those millions of people from the middle part of the 20th century who were packed on to trains bound for annihilation, but there is little time to reflect before the curtain falls (rather than rising, as it does in most theatrical events). You are plunged into darkness and sent spinning on several disorienting circuits during which apparitions flit before your disbelieving eyes. </p> <p>Likely to be one of the most talked-about pieces of theatre this year, Carnesky's Ghost Train is a marvellous mix of technical wizardry and sheer heart and soul. Its potential as a piece of on-going, ever-changing and developing theatre is enormous. For the same amount of money as a single West End theatre ticket you could ride the ghost train eight times - and feel as though you've experienced something different on each occasion. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until September 23.

  "A carefully constructed compromise on the charitable status of private schools has come apart at the seams. The draft charity bill, which has been scrutinised by a joint parliamentary committee before being reintroduced in the next session of parliament, deliberately avoids a precise definition of charity to avoid the absurdities of the current law. Dating back to 1601, when human rights had not reached the public agenda, current law endorses the Royal Opera House as a charity but not Amnesty International, winner of a Nobel peace prize. The new bill leaves the resolution to a restructured Charity Commission, which will decide whether new or existing charities conform to one of 12 new categories of public interest. But now, as we reported yesterday, the commission believes the new public benefit tests would not allow it to challenge the charitable status of private schools set under earlier case law. <p>The commission seems to be the only body taking this line - and even they appeared to be having second thoughts yesterday. There is a long history of case law being overtaken by statute. There is also a common theme in earlier case law that charities must not exclude people on low incomes. One reason why some private schools originally received charitable status was that they were founded to educate poor students. All of this suggests the new chief commissioner and her lawyers are not the right people to regulate this part of the bill. Yet ministers have been little better. Fiona Mactaggart made contradictory claims at the bill's launch, declaring private hospitals providing a service \"available only to people who can afford high fees\" would not be eligible for charitable status - yet she was somehow confident private schools would be. No wonder Alan Milburn, the scrutiny committee chairman, declared this part of the bill \"a dog's breakfast\". </p> <p>It should not be difficult to tighten the bill's current wording so that there is a clear obligation on the charity commission to test the public benefit of private schools. Yet ministers should go one better and seize this opportunity to remove charitable status from private schools and hospitals. It would save up to \u00a3100m on schools alone in tax relief that could be reinvested in the state sector. There would be more than enough work for the commission to regulate the other 180,000 registered charities without being sucked into the private school and hospital quagmire. One aim of the bill is to restore public confidence in charities. Removing the anomaly of rich private schools and hospitals getting charitable tax breaks is in line with this goal.</p>",
  "<p>A city hospital apologised yesterday after five patients were wrongly injected with an anti-tuberculosis vaccine during treatment for eyelid conditions.</p> <p>Staff at Bradford Royal Infirmary mistook the medicine for Botox, which had been prescribed to ease blepharospasm, a muscular spasm which prevents control of the eyelids. </p> <p>The error was spotted and the patients were recalled for checks which found some suffering from swellings. A spokesman for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS trust said that apologies, explanations and reassurances had been given in each case. </p> <p>He said: \"We very much regret what has happened. Each patient has been traced, assessed by a hospital specialist, and had a meeting with us.\" </p> <p>The five have been put on a course of antibiotics as a precautionary measure against reactions to the BCG anti-TB vaccine.</p> <p>The pharmacy unit where the mistake occurred prepares some 60,000 medicines for injection every year.

  "'This is horrible, man. I wouldn't give this to my dog.\" But the guy hasn't thrown away his falafel sandwich. He munches steadily away, stopping only when he thinks of another insult. \"I wouldn't feed this to my Jack Russell, man.\" His friend grins, pays and gestures an apology. <p>Looking back, I'm surprised no one actually attacked us during our 11 weeks selling falafel this summer in Hoxton Square. At midnight on Saturday, when young England pours out of the pubs and clubs of Shoreditch, east London, the first requirement is fried animal protein. Hence exchanges along the lines of: \"What kind of meat is this made from?\" \"It's chickpeas.\" \"Chicken what?\" </p> <p>Maybe I was inspired by figures like Dr John Harvey Kellogg, the crank who in 1884 patented the first \"flaked cereal\", or John Cadbury, who launched his chocolate and cocoa business in 1831 believing he would promote temperance and a healthy alternative to alcohol. My business plan was to popularise healthy eating, make a fortune to rival that built on cornflakes or Cadbury's Dairy Milk and, with the help of my Sudanese and Lebanese colleagues, to do my bit to defuse the Clash of Civilisations. </p> <p>Even at the time, I wondered if the project might appear like a case study in mania. The remortgage to buy the van. The excessive poring over colour brochures from Wilkinson Catering Systems of Preston (did I need \"swirled stainless, inside and out\"?). And finally, various trips up the M6 to return with a food trailer, after which I gloated, rather like Mr Toad with his new car, over fryers, ambient-temperature bain-marie trays and an eye-level display fridge. </p> <p>This was how I justified it to myself. The fast-food chains are currently trying to give the impression that they sell anything but hamburgers. But in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus, they already have the perfect snack in the falafel sandwich, which I explained to customers as \"Middle Eastern veggieburgers - but nicer than that sounds\". Britain, unlike America, is not yet saturated with falafel sellers, although the grim versions sold in supermarkets and some kebab shops are threatening to spoil the product's reputation. </p> <p>Falafel, or taamiya if you're Egyptian or Sudanese, are balls made of chickpeas or other pulses, soaked, then put through a mincer with parsley, onion, garlic and coriander. You form them with a device rather like a mini-mashed potato scoop and fry them, often after adding baking powder to make them puff up. </p> <p>Falafel has been adopted as an Israeli national dish and via Israel has become ubiquitous in the US. This version is usually served in pitta bread with hummus. So a common question from customers was, \"Can we have hummus with that?\" The answer was a resounding no. Falafel, like hummus, is made from chickpeas; falafel with hummus is like eating roast beef with meatballs on the side. The key elements are tahini sauce (crushed sesame paste with lemon juice), parsley, salad, and pickled cucumber and turnip (in brine, not vinegar). </p> <p>No two Middle Eastern families, let alone nations, agree on a canonical formula for falafel. But even Israelis and Palestinians can line up together in insisting that it must be freshly made and fried - from a supermarket chill cabinet it is an abomination. </p> <p>The pitfalls of my scheme were obvious. Apart from the unproven appeal of Middle Eastern vegan street food, we were intending to grab a space reserved, by longstanding custom, for parking by the doormen of the Bluu Bar and the Hoxton Square Bar and Kitchen. </p> <p>Then there were ... cultural issues. One of the first questions I was asked by Kassem, a meticulous chef who is a Shia Muslim from south Lebanon, was whether there would be room to pray in the trailer. It had already emerged that some of our best customers were gay and lesbian regulars at Golf Sale, Hoxton's celebrated Sunday-nighter, who could be uninhibitedly affectionate with each other while waiting to be served. And of course there was utter my lack of business experience. </p> <p>In the event, none of this mattered. The bouncers turned out to be pussycats, and were among our best customers and biggest (in every sense) supporters. Kassem proved unembarrassable, and simply giggled when asked if he preferred to give or receive. </p> <p>And the money worked. My friends at Notting Hill's Mandola Sudanese cafe, which supplied the ground and seasoned chickpeas and sauces, argued that to sell a falafel sandwich for \u00a32 was financial suicide and insulted their creativity. But we sold an awful lot of sandwiches and even had some profits to share, eventually. It was an escape from the usual marketing divide, in which food is either cheap, or healthy and delicious. </p> <p>Some good things happened serendipitously. My ex-wife's sister provided two strings of programmable dance lights, which became our visual trademark. Some Woolworth special-offer folding chairs, put out on the car-park gravel, suggested the seaside; one of our customers christened the effect \"Hoxton beach\". My artist brother-in-law Matthew wrote up the menu boards in an exuberant fairground script, topped by a grinning djinn; this, although Matthew never met him, looked uncannily like the debonair Hisham, a Sudanese trainee accountant who fried falafel on Fridays and Saturdays and broke many (rather drunken) girls' hearts. </p> <p>A by-law kept us seven metres back from the footpath; any closer and we would have required a street trading licence, which in Hackney is hard to get outside a street market. We used a floodlight to make us visible, and people often used this for creative shadow play on the rear wall of the car park. </p> <p>But there were problems - such as the shopping. I think proper falafel sandwiches require round Arab flatbread. When we ran out of tahini sauce or pickles at 11pm, I could drive up the Kingsland Road and find the Turkish rather than the Lebanese version - but when it came to bread, the Turkish shops were mostly selling pitta. If they had Arab khubz, it was stale, or available in tiny quantities, or both. London, you discover, is divided into an Arab west and a Turkish and Cypriot north. </p> <p>Then there was the oil issue. Standard cooking oil is made from rapeseed and creates a dank, cabbage-like reek. In Sudan they use groundnut oil, and the nearest source of catering-size drums turned out to be from Gujarati shops in Wembley - a 25-mile round trip. </p> <p>The locals were generally friendly - even the growing band of restaurateurs, who didn't seem to see meals that cost \u00a32 to \u00a33 as competition. We did, however, try the patience of some nearby residents on the first night when we used a hired \"silent\" generator that wasn't. Hackney's noise team sent a letter warning us not to do it again, but from the second night onwards we switched to an electrical feed. We made sure we closed soon after the bars, and the environmental health inspectors who appeared a couple of weeks later went away satisfied. </p> <p>Finally, someone found our Achilles heel. We were paying rent but not, it emerged, to the parking lot's freeholder, and the leaseholders told us, shamefacedly, that we had to move on. So I applied directly the freeholder. Three weeks later, via a terse solicitors' letter, they declined, without stating why. </p> <p>Perhaps the story is also about a clash between two different senses of entitlement. I felt we had a right to be in Hoxton Square because we were Doing Good: providing cheap, healthy food and responding immediately to criticisms. Quite a few local people seemed to like us: 200 of them, including many local restaurant staff, signed an instant petition saying we should be allowed to stay. </p> <p>The freeholders, and a small number of residents, took a different view. Anyway, it's history. Now they can all go back to their trench warfare against the bars, the minicabs, the crowds, the drunkenness, the noise ... We've taken the folding chairs from Hoxton beach and are now looking for a new gravel patch to call our own. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Patrick Matthews is the author of two wine books, The Wild Bunch 1997 and Real Wine 2000, and is currently writing a guide on buying Burgundy direct from growers.</p>",
  "<p>What, lads and ladettes of the ad world, you've dropped \"Have a Break, Have a KitKat\" and changed it to \"Make the most of your Break\"? Are you joking? If I'd been copy head at that meeting I'd have said, \"Break it off, guys, it won't work. Think again. You change a slogan at your peril; at the very least it's got it be snappier than the one before, and you haven't even changed the recipe so that something else is new beside the slogan. At the very least bung in some extra vitamin C (a cheap preservative) and tell them it sounds good. But what have you got now? Same old biscuit bar, boring new slogan, uneasy customers.\" </p> <p>Sure, I'd have said, I know your sales are 9% down. I know that when Mars lost \"A Mars a Day Helps You Work, Rest and Play\" sales increased by 20% but then they lowered the calorie content and made it lighter and sleeker at the same time, and found a great new slogan: \"Pleasure You Can Measure\". Semantically attractive and you can say it with lingering relish. \"Lads and ladettes,\" I would beseech them, \"face it! 'Make the Most of your Break' is just plain dull. And where is that old fashioned but essential thing - the Unique Selling Proposition? Search your hearts.\" I'd beg them, \"Find out what KitKat has that other chocolate bars don't. A Lion Bar is nicer, everyone knows, and feels younger and tastes junglier: but it's not so safe, is it, sticky rather than snappy? KitKat has a good history: it's part of our past: part of our language and culture and senior citizens everywhere remember the days when a KitKat had shiny silver paper round its inside layer which made them feel wealthy and contemporary. Build on that. Don't throw it away!\" </p> <p>It takes quite a lot to break a brand preference once it's established - Marks &amp; Spencer are working hard on it: now you lot at Nestl\u00e9 Rowntree seem to be doing the same. </p> <p>Sure, I understand your arguments: I know the modern workplace is unstructured and the whistle doesn't go for tea break - it's bottled water on the run these days - and the client is bored stiff with the old slogan and wants a trip to town and an excuse for a meeting: I know all that. I know that advertising is more about booking space than selling product, but we have at least to put on a face that sales are our main concern. </p> <p>The British public dislikes change: and the problem for advertisers is that change makes people think. Change the slogan and the 47 people a second who eat a KitKat in this country will suddenly start wondering: why am I eating this and not a Snickers? Snickers have a nubblier feel and fit the hand better. And here am I, eating a KitKat only because I shared one with my then fianc\u00e9e in the summer of love, and she's run off with a lesbian, and I'm not actually sure I like KitKat any more. And I miss the silver paper. And in those days it cost a penny and today it costs 35p. Is it worth it? </p> <p>Think along these lines, lads and ladettes. That two verbs are better than one in a slogan. If you must change, try \"Take a breather, take a KitKat\". That moves the product right out of the workplace and anyone could do with a breather, God knows, in the middle of Big Brother. TV-watching snacks is where the gap in the market currently is. Crisps alone are not enough. \"Take your poxy suggestion back to your open-plan cubicles,\" I'd have said, \"and come up with something sharp.\" And on your way, ask yourself why the Dairy Milk bar is now market leader and has replaced you in the affections of the British People? The word \"Dairy\" is what I'd suggest, with its undertones of goodness and nature and back to the land, to neutralise consumer anxiety while they stuff themselves with sugar and carbs. Go away if you will and do some research and prove me wrong - but I bet I'm not. </p> <p>Oh, and also do some research on whether chocolate through and through seems better value to today's young than a chocolate-coated biscuit. As if they were somehow being fobbed off? Given what they could afford, not what they wanted? Perhaps the \"as well hung for a sheep as a lamb\" feeling we all have today applies to calories as well as debt? What is the connection between \"spend more\" and \"eat more\"? Go on, find out. </p> <p>Also, I'd point out, the imperative form of the verb is old-fashioned. \"Haven't you realised,\" I'd call out after them down the corridor, \"that the present participle is the in, reassuring thing? How about 'Taking a Breather, Sharing a KitKat' (I offer that to Nestl\u00e9 Rowntree for free, for old times' sake)? With a picture of a couple down a cave or up a mountain, or coming up from a shag (if you must), or a smiling doctor and a nurse in casualty? So you keep that sense of worthiness - while consuming calories the consumer is seen to be occupying the moral high ground. I reckon that's a better use of six words than \"Make the Most of your Break\". </p> <p>You're in the business of spin, these days, lads and ladettes in the creative core of the ad world, not just thinking up ways of selling space for the client. You need to sharpen up your ideas. Doesn't the Home Office - from which unsafe, unjust and intolerant legislation flows non-stop - describe itself as \"building a safe, just and tolerant society\"? Does not my local county council, while the prisons fill up with humiliated old folk unable to pay the council tax, describe itself as \"caring, enjoying, living?\" Just take a feel-good word and add \"ing\" and you're away, these days: the Orwellian semantics of the new world order flow seamlessly through our brains. </p> <p>I loved being a copy head. But I'm not any longer. I got fired decades back, for declining to take the whole thing seriously, even in those days, back in the 60s, when everyone was frivolous and there was full employment. I doubt the post even exists any more. You'd need to be a \"creative head\", more interested in pictures than words, arty rather than wordy. Copy hardly counts. Very few who work in advertising are language-sensitive. They're not meant to be. As consumers we look and listen, we don't read. So we end up with \"Make the Most of your Break\": dull, dull, dull, but no doubt with a great visual.</p>",
  "Britain's most senior openly gay police officer has spoken about his frustrations in his role of deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police. <p>Brian Paddick, who came to prominence for his controversial cannabis experiment in Lambeth in south London in 2001, has told the Guardian that the position he was promoted to in January is a \"bit of a non-job\". </p> <p>In an interview in today's Society Guardian he says he has not made a single decision since taking up the \u00a3118,000-a-year desk job at New Scotland Yard. </p> <p>Mr Paddick is responsible for strategic and business development in territorial policing, which includes responsibility for analysis, planning, strategic change, performance review and all territorial policing policy with the Met. </p> <p>Pressed to explain what the job means in practice, he says: \"I don't understand it. It is a bit of a non-job.\" </p> <p>Asked how he feels doing a \"non-job\", he responds: \"To say I'm bored and frustrated is a pretty accurate interpretation.\" </p> <p>Mr Paddick is renowned for the frankness with which he expresses his often controversial views. When he was the commander of Lambeth he told a radical website, <a href=\"http://www.Urban 75.com\">Urban 75.com</a>, he found the idea of anarchism attractive. \"I'm not controversial for the sake of it,\" he says. \"My opinion is sought and it carries some weight.\" </p> <p>Mr Paddick was forced to leave Lambeth after a former partner alleged he had smoked cannabis at home. </p> <p>He denied the allegations and, after an investigation, no criminal charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. </p> <p>Mr Paddick says it still pains him that he was not reinstated as borough commander, which he describes as his dream job. </p> <p>Instead he was moved sideways and then promoted to one of eight deputy assistant commissioners who work on operational policy. </p> <p>\"There are some good deputy assistant commissioner jobs and some less good ones,\" he says. \"Somebody has to do the less good ones and it's my turn at the moment.\" </p> <p>Asked if his goal was to become the Met commissioner - a position being vacated by Sir John Stevens - he says: \"Maybe it is better not to be at the top of the tree, you are freer to speak out. There are issues that need to be talked about.\" </p> <p>Mr Paddick, 46, who joined the Met in 1976, says he has considered leaving because of homophobic behaviour. </p> <p>\"I have seriously thought about leaving the job at times because sometimes I have been treated inappropriately by line managers,\" he says. </p> <p>Although he says that fewer people in the police service now have problems with colleagues who are gay, he adds: \"There are still some.\" </p> <p>Asked whether the Met has proved to be a genuine meritocracy, he says: \"I've had my concerns from time to time. </p> <p>\"To be a deputy assistant commissioner in the Met with my track record of causing my bosses anxiety from time to time with my public statements is proof of the pudding.\" </p> <p>It was an incident involving an officer in Lewisham, south London, when Mr Paddick was an inspector, that proved a turning point for him. </p> <p>The officer was beaten up by his flatmate - another police officer - after bringing a male friend home. The fact that the officer had been living as a gay man while being an effective law enforcer led Mr Paddick to leave his wife and start a new chapter in his private life. </p> <p>It was almost a decade later, however, before he was prepared to be open about his sexuality at work. Having become a borough commander, he says it was time to \"make a difference\", even if that meant hurting his promotion prospects. </p> <p>\"The police service and society had changed out of all proportion since I'd joined 28 years before. A lot of people had made a lot of sacrifices to help me to be comfortably gay, and it was time I was at the leading edge helping other people.\"</p>",
  "The letter from the Pakistan high commission (Letters, July 30) about my article on the background to the September 11 attacks is factually wrong on every count. <p>As anyone can check, I said that Omar Sheikh, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammad as alleged by the Pakistan commission, \"almost certainly\" did not kill Pearl. The letter claims I did not cite my sources. I did - I stated that both the US government and Pearl's wife acknowledged that Omar Sheikh was not responsible. </p> <p>The letter also claims I stated that Mohammad wired $100,000 to the lead hijacker Mohammad Atta before the 9/11 attacks. I did not: I said that Omar Sheikh wired this money, on the instructions of General Mahmood Ahmed, then head of the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). </p> <p>The letter goes on that I did not cite evidence for this either. I did - I stated the source was the Wall Street Journal (on October 10-11 2001), and it has been corroborated by the FBI. </p> <p>Finally, I did not say that the Pakistan government was involved, but rather that the Pakistan ISI was, which is not the same thing at all, and that the ISI is known to have very close links with certain elements within the CIA.<br> <b>Michael Meacher MP</b><br> Lab, Oldham West and Royton</p>",
  "An Irish engineer was shot dead yesterday after a gunman burst into his office in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, officials said last night. <p>The dead man was named as Tony Christopher, a 63-year-old civil engineer working for a Saudi company. </p> <p>It was not clear whether the shooting was linked to a wave of anti-western attacks in the country by supporters of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network. </p> <p>An Irish foreign ministry spokeswoman in Dublin confirmed the killing. \"Our consular section and our embassy in Riyadh are involved,\" she said. \"Beyond that, we're not in a position to comment further.\" </p> <p>There was no immediate information on any motive, and a statement by Riyadh's head of police said the shooting was being investigated. </p> <p>Militants linked to al-Qaida have targeted western nationals since May 2003 in an attempt to destabilise Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer.

  "<p>American regulators have been asked to begin a criminal investigation of AstraZeneca over alleged late reporting of side-effects from its cholesterol-lowering drug, Crestor. </p> <p>Campaign group Public Citizen claims that 23 incidents of muscle-wasting or kidney failure were reported up to three months late when they should have been reported within two weeks, according to United States law. </p> <p>The allegations were made in a letter to Lester Crawford, the acting commissioner of the food and drug administration. \"I urge you immediately to begin an investigation because such apparently criminal behaviour ... severely impairs the FDA's ability to promptly and accurately evaluate the safety of marketed drugs,\" wrote Public Citizen director Sidney Wolfe. </p> <p>The FDA said it was \"unaware of delayed reporting\" but that it was investigating. It continues to insist the drug is safe. AstraZeneca said none of the cases had to be reported within 15 days. </p> <p>\"This is one more false, misleading, inaccurate report from Mr Wolfe and Public Citizen,\" said a statement from the drugs firm, which is the UK's second largest in the sector. </p> <p>The campaign group appears to have achieved part of its aims as Crestor's sales growth has been affected by the war of words on the subject. </p> <p>United States regulators said there is no evidence that Crestor is akin to Baycol, a drug with a similar mode of action which had to be withdrawn during 2001 due to fatal incidents of the muscle-wasting disease. </p> <p>\"There is no signal at this time that [Crestor] is like Baycol, even after nine months on the market,\" said Dr Mary Parks, the deputy director of the FDA's metabolic and endocrine drug products division. </p> <p>She said the cases of kidney failure and muscle-wasting associated with Crestor were an \"order of magnitude\" different to that of Baycol. </p> <p>Crestor was launched in the US in September and now has 1.2 million patients in the country. It is one of a group of drugs known as statins. One such, Lipitor, is the world's biggest selling drug and this week won a victory against rivals because it can be advertised as preventing heart disease.</p>",
  "<b>New York Post</b> <br> Editorial, August 3 <br>\"President George Bush - for better or worse - proposed the creation of a national intelligence tsar to help facilitate the war on terror [on Monday].

  "<p>Abe Peled, a leading figure in the war against digital piracy, plays down his military background. Born in Israel, he commanded an infantry platoon in the 1967 six-day war. He says his job as head of satellite encryption group NDS - protecting the world's largest pay-television companies from hackers - requires entirely different skills. </p> <p>Despite his protestations, the analogy with his present job is easy to make; in fact Mr Peled makes it himself: \"It's an arms race, to some extent.\" </p> <p>The size of the business that hackers are chipping away at underlines the daunting scale of the daily task faced by NDS. With a customer base that includes BSkyB in Britain, Sky Italia and American satellite broadcaster DirecTV, it protects annual pay-TV revenues worth $20bn (\u00a311bn). </p> <p>The music industry has attracted most of the headlines charting the rise of digital piracy, but NDS has also attracted significant column inches. </p> <p>Over the past two years it has faced lawsuits from broadcasters including Vivendi Universal's pay-TV arm Canal Plus, Sogecable in Spain and EchoStar in America. Litigation from EchoStar and Sogecable is still pending in California. </p> <p>Allegations that the group has at times turned poacher - that it cracked rival technologies and made their secrets available to counterfeiters on the internet - are emphatically rejected by Mr Peled and NDS. They add to a perception that NDS operates in the murky world of counter-espionage, employing former hackers and secret service agents to blunt the growing threat of well-organised, sophisticated criminal gangs. </p> <p>On the face of it, the majority of its business seems more prosaic. Founded in Israel, NDS is now based in Staines, Middlesex, employs more than 2,000 people and is 78% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. </p> <p>It supplies 44m decoder cards to pay-TV companies around the world, licenses anti-piracy software to technology companies and its new technologies unit helped develop the Sky+ personal video recorder. Switching to a new contract with DirecTV contributed to a 7% dip in revenues to \u00a3220.5m in the year to June 30, but turnover of up to \u00a3300m is expected this year with an operating profit of \u00a360m. </p> <p>Mr Peled is open about employing former hackers and people with law enforcement or military backgrounds. </p> <p>The group's head of operational security, or chief hacker catcher, is Reuven Hazak, former deputy head of the Israeli internal security service. These appointments, which number one or two people in every country in which NDS operates, have an obvious logic, he says. </p> <p>\"This [pay-TV piracy] is not the uppermost crime in the minds of the police so we have to find out where they are, how they operate and then put together the package to help the law enforcement agencies. These are people that typically have an intelligence background, either from law enforcement or the military. When the music industry finally woke up, they started doing these kinds of things, tracking the internet, spamming websites - things we started doing years ago.\" </p> <p>That was one of three innovations NDS introduced after it was established in 1988. The others were embedding customised software chips in set-top boxes and employing reformed hackers: \"Obviously they are no longer pirates.\" </p> <p>\"I recognised that hackers are very different to the people that we have. </p> <p>\"The typical profile of a good hacker is that they are lateral thinkers, not particularly educated. They are autodidacts, whereas engineers are trained to think differently. So having people with that kind of thinking contributing to our designs was a necessary step up in improving our ability to respond.\" </p> <p>Mr Peled talks of being \"assailed on right and left\", perhaps trying to place his company on the centre ground, surrounded by hackers and litigious pay-TV groups. </p> <p>The most well-publicised spat came with Canal Plus Technologies in 2002, whose lawsuit alleging corporate espionage was dropped when News Corporation acquired Vivendi Universal's Italian pay-TV unit, Telepiu. Mr Peled scorns the idea that NDS would encourage counterfeiters to infiltrate a competitor's technology. </p> <p>\"The more money pirates make, the more powerful they are. They will not make money from cracking our platforms but if they crack other platforms they will make a lot of money. If you make a card for $5 and sell it for $200, it has a better margin than selling drugs. And then they can use the money to attack us.\" </p> <p>News Corp's rivals claim NDS has destabilised competitors, and Mr Peled says: \"Complete garbage. It's exactly that kind of envy. News Corp has been successful, so they look for wider accusations.\" </p> <p>NDS has designs on the American cable market and on China, where the group has employed its first security man in Hong Kong. Mr Peled believes a government target of 30m digital cable homes by the 2008 olympics in Beijing is a significant opportunity. </p> <p>There are an estimated 120,000 digital cable subscribers in China, and NDS is pitching to protect the digital infrastructure from piracy. </p> <p>While Mr Peled is proud of NDS's record - BSkyB has been pirate-free for six years - he argues that copyright protection will become an even greater struggle as growth in digital distribution generates more opportunities. </p> <p>\"It has the dramatic potential of undermining the economics of the industry unless done in a way that is fair for the content owner and the artists. </p> <p>\"There have to be means of enforcement. Just because people are educated that stealing is bad does not mean they don't have locks on their doors.\"</p>",
  "Precisely at noon tomorrow, the Bank of England will announce what it is doing to interest rates. The smart money is on a quarter-point rise - the fifth since November. If so, it will be good news for savers; not so cheery for somebody with a big mortgage or a company with a whopping overdraft. <p>What's interesting, though, is that the decision will arouse no political controversy. Sure, there will be analysts who will question the wisdom of the decision and there will be those who will grumble about having to pay more for their loans, but only a tiny minority will question the process. The assumption is that the nine members of the Bank's monetary policy committee have looked at all the available data in order to fulfil their mandate of keeping inflation at 2%. Put simply, the Bank enjoys something in short supply in the Britain of 2004: trust. </p> <p>Granting the Bank operational independence over interest rates five days after it was elected in 1997 was Labour's most significant reform. It is not just that the Bank has managed for the past seven years to keep inflation within the bounds set down by Gordon Brown, nor even that the economy as a whole has - unlike many other leading industrial nations - enjoyed a period of uninterrupted growth. It is that voters no longer assume - fairly or not - that the government will play politics with interest rates and screw up the economy as a result. </p> <p>After the various crises of the previous quarter century under both Conservative and Labour governments - booms, busts, Black Wednesday, IMF-imposed spending cuts, runs on the pound - public trust in economic management hit rock bottom in the 1990s. Reforms to the Bank helped to rebuild trust in economic policy. The question now is whether the same approach can help rebuild trust in politics. </p> <p>Contrast the Bank's reputation with that of the government. It is an exaggeration to say that nobody accepts a word ministers say, but not that much of one. Labour can reel off a litany of achievements - falling crime, a million children lifted out of poverty, the lowest unemployment for a generation - and the assumption is that it is Pinocchio telling another whopper. This applies even to core Labour voters. At an Amicus summer school a couple of weeks ago, I suggested that the government had some notable successes to its name. \"But can we trust the statistics,\" one official said. \"How do we know the government hasn't fiddled the figures.\" </p> <p>There are at least three possible explanations for this mood. The first is that the Blair government really has achieved precious little with its two landslides. Michael Howard would say the NHS is getting worse rather than better. From the left, the criticism is that the gulf between rich and poor is growing wider. </p> <p>A second thesis is that the government can boast some achievements, but its over-use of spin has meant these have been blown out of all propor tion. It's all very well, for example, for ministers to say that the number of people out of work and claiming benefit is at its lowest level since 1975, but how about the 2.4 million people who are excluded from the labour market because they are classified as long-term sick and disabled? </p> <p>Finally, it's Iraq, stupid. Labour's problems, from this perspective, are the result of the government's support for the US-led military action to topple Saddam Hussein. Up until that point, voters were prepared - if a bit hesitantly - to give Labour the benefit of the doubt. Now they think ministers are lying about everything, from welfare to weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>This lack of trust is deeply troubling, not just for Labour but for the entire political process. The notion that the government is merely suffering from a bad dose of the mid-term blues or that political disaffection is only an issue for the chattering classes is belied by the increasing support for fringe parties. In any case, ministers know things are serious, and in private will admit that a problem of economic credibility has been replaced by a problem of political credibility. What does this mean for the government? Well, obviously, it means that the message of its second term - that investment in public services means better schools and hospitals - is tending to fall on deaf ears. Even worse, it means that politics has been reduced to the fire-fighting that used to mark vain attempts in the past to shore up sterling. Success was measured out then in days and weeks. Could the Bank of England stave off the speculators and buy time to put in place a new package of measures to reassure the markets? Now it's a question of whether there is a snappy new policy that will halt the run on the Blair. </p> <p> The message from history is that the Micawberish approach didn't work for economic policy or, if it did, only as a short-term palliative. Something didn't turn up, and it took independence for the Bank finally to change public perception. Brown has had more leeway on economic policy than any of his Labour predecessors, but in order to get power he had to give some power away first. Brown's reforms of the Bank of England should now be used as the template for political renewal. The government is living in a fool's paradise if it thinks that trust will be regained purely by the passage of time. It needs to do something, and that something has to involve constitutional change to insure that there is no repetition of the way Britain became involved in Iraq. </p> <p>In the case of monetary policy the executive ceded power to the Bank, in matters of military policy it should cede power to parliament. It is quite something that decisions on war and peace are a matter for royal prerogative - just as they were 90 years ago today when Britain entered the first world war. This should be the starting point for change. </p> <p>A counter argument might be that MPs had a vote before the shooting started in Iraq. Technically this is true, but having decisions rubber-stamped once troops have been deployed is no substitute for a process where the executive cannot act until it has the approval of parliament in full possession of the facts. That would mean MPs having the right to see legal advice from the attorney general. A properly defined role for the cabinet would be a welcome change, too. </p> <p>Whether or not regime change was a good reason for military action, a large chunk of the population feels that Britain did so on the basis of a false prospectus. At best, voters think the government was economical with the truth, at worst they believe it deliberately lied. The loss of trust is now so deep that it will take more than the passage of time, any number of reports from esteemed members of the peerage or even a change at the top to alter perceptions. It took decisive action for Labour to lose its postwar reputation as the party that devalued the pound. After devaluing the political currency, something equally radical is now called for.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">Larry Elliott</a> is the Guardian's economics editor</p>",
  "<p>Over the next few years there is going to be a boom in the business of making money from Ministry of Defence (MoD) castoffs. The government review announced last month will see massive reductions in equipment. The Royal Navy will scrap 15 vessels by the end of 2005, the army will have four fewer infantry battalions and the RAF will be down four aircraft squadrons and at least one air base. </p> <p>The government wants to ensure that every piece of equipment no longer needed does not go to waste. </p> <p>The MoD's disposal services agency (DSA) and its 80 staff are responsible for everything from boots to battleships. Items not mothballed or picked over for spares will be sold for reuse if possible, or recycled. You can at present pick up armoured personnel carriers, fire engines, motorbikes and bullet-proof Ford Mondeos. </p> <p>The big money deals of the past involve items such as the Hercules aircraft sold to Austria, the warships that went to Bangladesh, Romania and Chile and the long-term Al Hussein Project, which has earned Britain \u00a312m by selling Challenger tanks, ammunition and training to Jordan. </p> <p>The obvious benefit for the UK is that it gets to make money out of equipment it no longer needs and might otherwise have to expensively scrap. It creates a future market for spares and can give the defence industry a foot in the door where it previously may have had little presence. </p> <p>Commodore Sym Taylor, the DSA's chief executive, says: \"The sale of surplus equipment gives UK exporters a marketing edge. The UK will be well placed to secure repeat orders. These orders are likely to be for new rather than secondhand equipment and therefore of much greater value.\" </p> <p>But the Campaign Against the Arms Trade takes an alternative view. A spokesman says: \"It doesn't really matter if the bullets are secondhand; weapons exports, especially to regions where there are conflicts or the countries are desperately poor, do not help.\" </p> <p>If the frigates earmarked to be made redundant do end up heading overseas then they will require a licence from the Department of Trade and Industry. These are designed to ensure that such exports are sold to appropriate governments, although campaigners say this is no more than fig leaf protection. </p> <p>The range of military equipment that needs to be dealt with presents the DSA with some challenges. Only when resale to other armed forces has failed are other options considered. When no government wanted to buy the frigate HMS Scylla, it was eventually sold to the National Marine Aquarium, and in March was scuttled off the Cornish coast to be used by divers. </p> <p>Most items are handed over to a select group of outside contractors, such as vehicle specialist Witham. It refurbishes hundreds of vehicles and sells them on, either through auction or private sale. Managing director Paul Foutherington says: \"We never know what we are going to get. In the last auction we sold a Chieftain tank for \u00a317,200 to a company that is going to use it as an advertising hoarding. </p> <p>In total, DSA contractors made more than \u00a35m in the last financial year from selling some 2,250 vehicles. </p> <p>The agency sells other items directly, and on its website you can find inflatable bridges, portable laundry units, radar and helicopters up for grabs. One of the most successful areas has been the sale of unwanted computers. Later this year the DSA plans to set up its own version of eBay - eTrade Exchange - which will put the agency, customers and contractors in touch with each other. </p> <p>When redundant equipment cannot be sold the DSA's official strategy is: \"Whenever possible ... to recycle equipment and material and contribute disposal policies aimed at protecting and enhancing the environment.\" It has a network of contractors that can strip items of anything that can be recycled. </p> <p>Taylor says: \"The DSA takes all environmental issues very seriously not just because of legislation but also simply because it makes economic and commercial sense. </p> <p>\"We know that disposal is a key part of the procurement cycle and managing this aspect sensibly produces a host of real benefits. On the other hand, neglecting it costs time and money and creates additional problems, not least a bad public image.\" </p> <p>There is now even an MoD Environmental Protection Training School. So far 1,300 civilian and service personnel have graduated from its three-day course on waste management. </p> <p>Barry Teideman, the DSA's business development director, says: \"The disposal of redundant or obsolete equipment may not seem particularly exciting, but no one, especially those in the defence sector, should ignore the subject, nor believe these issues will go away.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The disoposal services agency is at <a href=\"http://www.disposalservices.agency.mod.uk\">www.disposalservices.agency.mod.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Tom Robinson's Sing If You're Glad to be Gay was in the charts in 1978, by which time Brian Paddick had been at the Metropolitan police for two years. Its lyrics attacked the harsh treatment that gay men received at the hands of the British police, who Robinson famously called \"the best in the world\". But the song made little impact on a young constable, who was to become the highest ranking openly gay police officer in the UK. At that time he was to all intents and purposes straight, and soon to be married. </p> <p>It was not until Jimmy Somerville sung about a young man having to leave home because he was gay that Paddick found a voice that he could relate to. </p> <p>\"As a young police officer, I was able to identify with young people who were unable to be open about their sexuality in the situation they found themselves in,\" he says. </p> <p>His five-year marriage was \"a genuine attempt to do what I, at the time, believed to be the right thing to do,\" he adds. </p> <p>Twenty years later, Paddick, now a deputy assistant commissioner at the Met, has become patron of Pace, a London-based counselling and information service for young lesbians, gay men and bisexuals that helps its clients deal with some of the issues he has experienced first hand. \"This is something that is needed, that I feel strongly about,\" he says. \"Pace supports people who are having problems at home or who are subject to homophobic bullying. I can identify with those sorts of issues, both from a personal and professional role.\" </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly for such a high profile gay man, he has not been inundated with requests to support gay and lesbian causes. This is primarily, he thinks, because of the traditionally difficult relationship between what Paddick terms the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) community and the police, which is perceived as a homophobic institution that enforces anti-gay laws. Last year buggery and gross indecency were finally decriminalised. </p> <p>So what possessed the secretly gay Paddick to join the Met? </p> <p>\"I've no idea,\" he laughs. Then adds: \"I have this thing about helping people. It's not altruism. I get a kick out of it.\" </p> <p>The son of a plastics' salesman and building society secretary from south London, he also wanted a job where you could get by on your merits. So has the Met proved to be a genuine meritocracy? \"I've had my concerns from time to time,\" he says. \"To be a deputy assistant commissioner in the Met with my track record of causing my bosses anxiety from time to time with my public statements is proof of the pudding.\" Those statements include saying on radical website <a href=\"http://www.Urban75.com\">Urban75.com</a> that he found the idea of anarchism attractive. He was at the time in charge of Lambeth. </p> <p>It was the example of a junior officer in Lewisham, south London, when Paddick was an inspector, that made him think seriously about coming out. The young officer had been beaten up by his flatmate - another police officer - after bringing a male friend home, but the fact that he was living as a gay man and being an effective law enforcer led Paddick to leave his wife and start a new chapter in his private life. </p> <p>It was almost a decade later, however, before he was prepared to be open about his sexuality at work. Having achieved his initial career goal of becoming a borough commander, he felt it was time to \"make a difference\", as he calls it, even if that meant damaging further promotion. </p> <p>\"The police service and society had changed out of all proportion since I'd joined 28 years before. A lot of people had made a lot of sacrifices to help me to be comfortably gay and it was time I was at the leading edge helping other people. </p> <p>\"I felt it was important that gay and lesbian staff in the Met knew there was someone at a senior level that they could come to.\" </p> <p>He says he is not qualified to say if it is a good career move now for a low-ranking police officer to be openly gay or lesbian as he didn't come out until he was an inspector. What he says instead is: \"Increasing numbers of people in the police service don't have issues with colleagues who are gay.\" He pauses, then adds: \"There are still some.\" </p> <p>He agrees that the lack of recorded information about the sexual orientation of officers in the Met is hardly encouragement for more gays and lesbians to raise their head above the parapet or to join the force, as it is impossible to know whether they will be discriminated against in terms of salary or promotion. </p> <p>\"I don't see how you can have an effective equalities' policy if there is no way of measuring if it's working,\" says Paddick. \"I have seriously thought, though, about leaving the job because sometimes I have been treated inappropriately by line managers,\" he admits. </p> <p>Sitting in this office at New Scotland Yard, following his promotion earlier this year, it still pains him that he was not reinstated to his dream job, commander of Lambeth. Following an investigation into the false allegations by an ex-partner made in a tabloid newspaper that he had smoked cannabis, he was moved sideways before securing his current desk job. </p> <p>The tabloid story followed Paddick's groundbreaking cannabis pilot that encouraged officers to warn those caught with the drug for personal use, instead of arresting them. </p> <p>His removal from the frontline is a cruel irony, given that Paddick's decision to come out publicly when he got the top job at Lambeth was a damage limitation exercise. The Met press office believed it would prevent the tabloid press sensationalising his sexuality at a time when he was under most pressure. </p> <p>The cannabis initiative, which arguably influenced the government to reclassify the drug, is not Paddick's greatest professional achievement to date. Without a hesitation, he says it is \"winning the support of the overwhelming majority of people, and the overwhelming majority of police officers and support staff at Lambeth\". </p> <p> And it is not hard to understand why the handsome commander was so popular with the public he is there to serve. His openness, lack of formality - everyone calls him Brian - and warm, friendly personality and self-deprecating humour make him more approachable than your average senior police officer. His south London accent is testimony to his roots. </p> <p>The legendary candid style is demonstrated by his views on his current position, which he describes as \"a bit of a non-job\". \"There are some good deputy assistant commissioner jobs and some less good ones. Somebody has to have the less good ones and it's my turn at the moment.\" Asked if he is bored and frustrated, he responds: \"To say I'm bored and frustrated is a pretty accurate interpretation.\" </p> <p>He laughs at the suggestion that he wants to be Met commissioner when Sir John Stevens shortly retires. Both the assistant commissioner and deputy commander posts are the next steps up the promotion ladder. </p> <p>\"Maybe it is better not to be at the top of the tree, you a freer to speak out,\" he says. \"There are issues that need to be talked about.\" </p> <p>Does being the highest ranking openly gay police officer give him more licence to speak his mind? </p> <p>\"It is irrelevant to much of what I do,\" he says rather disingenuously. But it is true that he is concerned with much more than just gay rights. He is passionate about policing and race. On that, and many subjects, you can be sure we have not heard the last from the outspoken law enforcer. </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Age </strong> 46 </p> <p><strong> Status</strong> Divorced </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> 1983-1986: first class degree in politics, philosophy and economics, Oxford University; 1991-92: MBA, Warwick Business School; 2000-01: diploma in applied criminology and police studies, Cambridge University. </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> 1976: constable, Metropolitan police; 1980: sergeant; 1983: inspector; 1989: chief inspector; 1996: superintendent; 1997-2000: chief superintendent, Merton borough; 2001-02: commander, Lambeth borough; 2003: responsible for community safety and partnership issues; 2004: deputy assistant commissioner, responsible for territorial policing policy. </p> <p><strong> Interests</strong> Weight training,swimming, socialising and clubbing.</p>",
  "David Blunkett, the home secretary, is believed to be close to backing a specific criminal offence of \"acts preparatory to terrorism\" as part of his extension of anti-terror legislation planned for this autumn. <p>This has been repeatedly urged by the Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Carlile, who has carried out the official reviews of the emergency anti-terror legislation. He argues that such a law would allow suspected international terrorists being interned indefinitely in Britain to face criminal trials instead.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett is expected to introduce the new \"broadly drawn\" offence of acts preparatory to terrorism alongside the renewal of his emergency powers to detain foreign nationals who are certified as suspected international terrorists - known as executive detention powers. </p> <p>He is also considering introducing new civil orders to restrict the activities of people linked to terrorism but who are not themselves considered serious terrorist suspects. </p> <p>The overhaul of the the anti-terror laws is being considered as American banks in London step up security after the discovery of detailed but dated plans for al-Qaida attacks in the US and Britain. </p> <p>The Home Office said no specific threat had emerged about Britain, adding: \"We are maintaining a state of heightened readiness in the UK.\" </p> <p>The new counter-terror package is expected to spark sharp criticism from civil liberties groups, who will be dismayed that Mr Blunkett has not used the opportunity to replace his emergency exec utive detention powers with realistic alternatives. </p> <p>New legislation is needed to renew the powers or they will lapse in November 2006 under the \"sunset clause\" in the original emergency legislation passed in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. </p> <p>The official consultation on the government's new counter-terrorism package will close at the end of the month with final decisions expected before November. </p> <p>It is expected that the emergency powers will continue to be used only against those who are suspected of being members of the al-Qaida network and their immediate associates. </p> <p>The package will amalgamate the Terrorism Act 2000, which deals with domestic terrorism, and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which deals with suspected international terrorists. </p> <p>The home secretary has already been forced to drop his ideas of reducing the standard of proof in terrorist cases and holding pre-emptive trials with secret evidence heard before vetted counsel in the face of open opposition from the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions, among others. </p> <p>It is believed that the security services also continue to oppose his more widely-supported plans to lift the ban on telephone tap evidence being used in British criminal trials in an attempt to secure more prosecutions as an alternative to executive detention without trial. </p> <p>The Home Office is working on producing a way of using intercept evidence in court without contravening the European Convention on Human Rights and with safeguards to prevent the disclosure of \"sensitive capabilities\" - information revealing how the security services go about their business. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett is also expected to announce this year that new powers to extend the scale of US-style \"plea bargaining\" in cases involving organised crime and drug smuggling will now cover terrorist cases. </p> <p>The review of the anti-terrorism laws, which are to form a major plank of the government's legislative programme this autumn, is likely to suffer a fresh setback today when a cross-party group of MPs and peers is expected to publish a highly critical report. </p> <p>The report from the joint parliamentary committee on human rights is likely to give its strong backing to alternatives to the renewal of the emergency powers of detention without trial of suspected international terrorists. </p> <p>The \"internment\" powers involve the British government in a continued \"opt-out\" from the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>",
  "<p>Even though it is easy to be cynical about the manner in which government initiatives burst forth, it is still difficult to be entirely blase about a new plan. Will there really be a reduction in violent crime with more community police patrolling the streets? Will people get a decent night's sleep now that antisocial behaviour orders can be slapped on noisy neighbours? </p> <p>It is difficult to abandon the notion that good government involves planners sitting around a table devising a rational solution to a pressing social problem and then proceeding with its implementation. But this can be a misleading model. </p> <p>In the area of law and order it often seems that the latest government initiative is as likely to be prompted by media hysteria as by careful political planning. And when good ideas do come along, their chances of making it into law are also hugely influenced by media-promoted \"public reaction\". </p> <p>A certain criminologist once suggested that law and order policy in Britain now has rather more to do with a single tabloid headline than a bushel of carefully researched policy documents. </p> <p>Perhaps the Home Office should abandon central planning altogether. The developments I have recently observed in Amsterdam certainly suggest there might be a more effective way of accomplishing social change. </p> <p>Amsterdam, like other large cities, has a problem with the hard drug users who hang around its central streets. These addicts are often homeless people who periodically resort to hustling and petty crime to finance their habit. When they eventually raise the cash to buy their drugs, they are at the mercy of unscrupulous dealers who have little regard for the purity of what they're selling. And once they have made their purchase, they have little option but to take their fix in the street and thereby make themselves liable to arrest. </p> <p>No one is happy. The council frets about the effect it all has on tourism; the police feel frustrated by the constant round of arrest and re-arrest; and the users themselves become increasingly wretched. </p> <p>This might seem like an excellent opportunity for someone to devise a grand plan. But it is a sensitive area. Any policy that appears to condone hard drug use or suggest that the police go soft on lawbreakers can expect a pretty hostile public reception. So instead of one central plan, Amsterdam council quietly prompts small groups of individuals to try out social experiments. </p> <p>In the case of the addicts, the first such experiment involved a trial of \"user rooms\", places where they could go and use their drugs. This was some improvement. The users weren't so liable to arrest and the tourists were spared the sight of people jacking up. But when they'd had their fix they were thrown out on to the street again and were once more at the mercy of the dealers. </p> <p>Last week, I saw the courageous experiment that had been devised to tackle these remaining problems. The Junkies Union is a private club for street addicts in an upmarket residential area of the city. When I arrived outside, minutes before its 10 o'clock opening time, there was no one in sight. But as soon as the door swung back, a group of tired, grubby, dishevelled people appeared, eagerly clutching their membership cards. </p> <p>This club is not simply somewhere for street addicts to use their drugs; it is also a place where they can buy what they want from a man who sits behind a large table in the main clubroom. He calls himself a \"social dealer\" and tells me that all his stuff is reasonably priced and quality-tested. The addicts, he tells me, regularly call him \"the doctor\". </p> <p>The two people who run this club are not social workers or therapists, they call themselves \"activists\". They tell me they have simple practical objectives. They want to show that street addicts are not a fearsome bunch: if you give them good clean drugs, allow them to use the drugs in comfort off the streets, and thereby keep them out of the arrest circuit, then they start to turn into normal, functioning people who could even hold down a job. </p> <p>But where did the money for the club come from? I was told, with a certain reluctance, that it was provided by the council. But did it know what the money was for? </p> <p>The council was aware it was for an experiment. And did it know the nature of the experiment? Sort of. It knew it was an experiment similar to the user rooms. But this was surely very different to the user rooms: this club was selling class A drugs. Yes. But what did the police, the public and the media think? I was told they didn't really have to know all about it until it had been tried and found to work. \"Once it works then everyone will be happy,\" I was told. </p> <p>It is strangely instructive to compare the quiet, almost secretive, manner in which this brave experiment has been conducted in Amsterdam with the national hue and cry that greeted the far more modest police announcement in the UK of a plan to go easy on marijuana smokers in Brixton. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Laurie Taylor is a fellow of Birkbeck College, University of London.

  "<p><strong> Equal measures</strong><br> Stephan Cross levels various charges at Unison (Cross purposes, July 28) that are simply not true. Unison takes pay inequality seriously, and has used the law on many occasions to challenge employers and governments. Our strategy is to negotiate pay arrangements that deliver equal pay, and to litigate where this does not deliver. </p> <p>It is outrageous for Cross to claim that Unison has done \"bugger all\" to push single status forward. It was Unison and other unions that negotiated the single status agreement, not some no win, no fee lawyer. </p> <p>Cross says that if branches will do deals with him he will drop his costs to 10%. We would prefer our members to get the money, not a lawyer. Unison does not do backdoor deals. It is a democratic organisation. </p> <p>Cross \"accuses\" us of defending two branch secretaries. Unison will do its utmost to resist any attempts to intimidate hardworking branch officials who are doing a very difficult job. In addition, Unison has no understanding, tacit or otherwise, to downgrade men's pay rather than lift women's. </p> <p>Finally, the simplest way to achieve equal pay is through direct negotiation with employing authorities. This is what Unison does. Litigation can take years, and while this is happening pay inequlaity continues. <br><strong>Dave Prentis</strong><br>General secretary, Unison </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong> Unlike private lawyers, the GMB union has to balance its strategy to deliver equal pay, prevent detriment to workers and protect future jobs and services. We will continue to pursue this strategy long after private lawyers have banked their cash and moved on to find the next \"window of opportunity\". Every penny that is paid to a lawyer is a penny less for single status and for low-paid women workers. </p> <p>To date, we have lodged 1,500 equal pay claims in the northern region. We have gained around \u00a314m in compensation for female members and achieved pay increases from 10% to 40% in some cases for those members. We are collating information from more than 2,000 completed equal pay questionnaires, and in the absence of proposals from employers to deal with past inequalities and the implementation of single status we will lodge further equal pay claims. </p> <p>We are driven in this process by our desire to do the best we can for our members, not for a pot of cash. We care about the future jobs and services that may be under threat from the costs of mass litigation, unlike certain lawyers who have only one agenda in mind, in our view, personal profit from the litigation process. </p> <p>We will not be diverted from our policy to achieve equal pay for all our members in the public services. <br><strong>Colin Smith</strong><br>Senior organiser, GMB northern region </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The issue of regrading staff in local government is much wider than gender inequality. </p> <p>I worked for four different Labour-controlled councils. With the exception of Greenwich, all delayed processing the regrading claims of lower paid white collar staff. </p> <p>Usually staff left in frustration before their appeals could be held. Delays of five years or more were not uncommon. The councils sincerely believed that they upheld workers interests, but the delays in processing claims for lower-paid workers contrasted with the remarkable speed with which senior management salaries were increased. <br><strong>Roger Blackhouse</strong><br>London </p> <p><strong> On your bike</strong><br> Ken Worpole's analysis of the failure of cycling to grip the public imagination in the UK misses the point (Chain reaction, July 28). The national cycle route is not filling up because Britain does not have a cycling culture. The work of Sustrans does make a contribution to the creation of such a culture, but the main driver has to be cycling as an alternative to private motor transport rather than as a recreational activity. </p> <p>I know several keen recreational cyclists who would not consider cycling (or using public transport) to travel to work. While cycling of any kind has undoubted health benefits for cyclists, the real environmental benefits will only occur when cycling is used for the multitude of regular short journeys that we undertake, principally commuting to work, but also shopping and attending social events. For these trips the national cycle route is of no direct relevance, unless you live near part of it. </p> <p>What this country has lacked is a concerted and consistent cycling policy from national government down to the level of local authorities, with resources to match. Worpole is right when he says that we need to work towards a \"tipping point\" - when cyclists become so numerous that their needs will be taken seriously - but visibility will only be achieved if it happens on our commuting and shopping routes. <br><strong>Ralph Mackridge</strong><br>Research student, faculty of the built environment, University of the West of England, Bristol </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> I recall great convoys of cycling workers going to and from the Vickers Armstrong factory at Brooklands. No motorist had much chance of getting past, they would have to travel at 10mph. However, in the late 1950s it became the fashionable thing to be a motorist. Now the problem is not so much the lack of cyclists, but the mass of cars and lorries. </p> <p>To get to a cycleway, many like me would have to brave sharing long miles of ordinary roads with the significant majority of drivers who make little concession to the cyclist. </p> <p>As Worpole points out, in parts of Europe they have \"joined up\" cycleways - many can wheel straight out of their front door on to one. <br><strong>David Mills</strong><br>York </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Write to: SocietyGuardian 119 Farringdon Road London EC1R 3ER or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\">society@theguardian.com</a></p>"
