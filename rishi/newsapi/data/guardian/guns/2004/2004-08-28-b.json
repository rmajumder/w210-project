  "Welcome, dear Observer readers, to the second day of your bank holiday weekend. Or, a more fitting description, welcome to purgatory. <p>Unless you are canny enough to be reading this in the international edition on some far-flung tropical beach, we welcome you to traffic delays on the Ms 1-347, cancelled trains, the uncomfortable couches of an airport departure lounge for your flight to nowhere fast, or to the quagmire commonly known as the Reading festival. Greet the three-hour check-out at the DIY superstore and the local refuse tip with a cheery grin and a doff of your cap, for it is the August bank holiday. </p> <p>Queues, queues and more queues. Speed restrictions, diversions and alternative routes aplenty. A shambolic long weekend of rail, road and air mayhem embraces you. Even worse, television is yours at the push of a button. Those who know what's good for them are staying at home, sealed in a self-enforced sensory-deprivation chamber, curtains, windows and emotions closed, with the TV off. Alone. </p> <p>Perhaps, in days of old, bank holidays were an altogether more enjoyable affair. Back then, when life was simpler, families packed themselves into their Austin Allegros and trundled down motorways empty of cars. Arriving at the seaside resortin record time, they unpacked their hampers beneath brilliant sunshine and settled back behind the windbreak for a joyous day out. </p> <p>But, unfortunately, modern life isn't like that. We demand more from our long weekends, desiring to travel further afield, squeezing in more home improvements, seeing more people... and the country becomes crippled. </p> <p>It is not as if this is some Boscastle-esque natural disaster, catching the nation unawares. It is not as if we didn't know this was coming. It started in 1871, when some bright spark introduced the Bank Holidays Act, meaning no trading could take place in financial establishments. </p> <p>Now England has eight, Scotland nine and Northern Ireland 10, each causing a mini maelstrom of chaos. The TUC is even calling on the government to give us three extra bank holidays, one at the autumn half term, one on national saints days and the final one on New Year's Eve. Either these people are mad or they are masochists. </p> <p>The argument behind the call for more bank holidays is to bring us into line with the rest of Europe. People on the Continent 'enjoy' an average of 11 constitutional days off per year. Portugal and Spain get up to 14 days' leave. Don't misunderstand me, I'm all for freebie days off (the more the better in my book) but I fail to see why we all have to take this communist-style day off en masse, bringing the entire country to a predictable halt in the process. </p> <p>Everything about bank holidays is so outdated, even the name. They should be renamed public holidays. We live in a 24-hour society where fewer people do the Monday to Friday nine-to-five grind. Modern lives are so haphazard that even banks recognise the need to tailor their services to suit us, hence the rise of phone and internet banking. How ironic that those for whom the holiday was invented - the banks - recognise the public's need for individuality, yet those behind the planning of bank holidays do not. </p> <p>One possible solution would be to add these enforced days off to our annual holiday entitlement, which would also mean the government would have to award every worker the legal right to them. This currently doesn't happen. At present, public holidays are awarded at the discretion of individual employers. Imagine the money it would save employers. No more taking sickies to watch the football in January. No more sudden and mysterious bouts of day-long flu on the short Wednesdays of winter. </p> <p>Take a public-holiday day and you could stay in bed guilt free. The World's Strongest Man/Woman/Pet would have to be put on more regularly to cope with demand, it's true, what with people staggering their breaks. But a teeny bit of future planning could have your mates arranging to take the day off, too, and with travel disruptions at a minimum, you could go somewhere and do something. Now that just leaves the weather...</p>",
  "Listeners to the BBC's Today programme voted last week that philosophy should be taught in schools. They might usefully begin by considering whether there is any moral distinction to be drawn between Sir Mark Thatcher and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. <p>As far as one can see, both men had precisely similar aims - i.e., to rid the world of an evil dictator who was causing his subjects a great deal of misery. </p> <p>In the case of Saddam Hussein, Blair insists that he did the right thing when he and his friend, George Bush, overthrew the tyrant. </p> <p>Sir Mark, who was arrested, has yet to give the world the justification for his alleged role in the attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea. But perhaps he, too, would maintain that the world would be a better place without President Teodoro Obiang, a man who, like Saddam, has a contempt for civil rights and a liking for torture and execution. </p> <p>It is said that Thatcher and his fellow plotters were really interested in securing the lucrative oil fields of this African state. But exactly the same is said against Blair. Wasn't the initial aim of the Pentagon to install their puppet, convicted fraudster Ahmed Chalabi, as leader of the newly democratic Iraq and thereby acquire all kinds of lucrative contracts for their business friends and backers? </p> <p>Sir Mark's operation was against the law, which is why he now finds himself under arrest. But, again, many lawyers argue that Blair's war was also illegal. In the circumstances, it seems rather unfair that Thatcher could be facing imprisonment while Blair is not only still at large but still running the country. </p> <p><b>Private failings</b></p> <p>The privatised railway companies have perfected the arts of persuading the public that they are doing everything to help them when actually all they are concerned about is their profit, or lack of it. </p> <p>The shutting down this weekend of the main line between Reading and Paddington to coincide with the August bank holiday has become an annual event, just like the Reading rock festival, which also coincides.</p> <p>And every year, the official explanation is the same: that far fewer people will be inconvenienced than if they were to close the line during a working week. How considerate they are, putting the welfare of commuters before those of a few thousand rock-loving teenagers. </p> <p>The reason for shutting down the line altogether - something that was never done in the days of British Rail - is that it is cheaper to do the work all at one go. The reason for doing it over the bank holiday weekend is that the loss to the railways is considerably less, but no one will say any of that. </p> <p>Nor will anyone explain why it is that, despite the annual closure, there has been no discernible improvement in the service. It now takes longer to get from Reading to Paddington than it used to and there are still just as many failures, as happened only last week when, once again, the system ground to a halt thanks to yet another breakdown of the signalling system. </p> <p><b>Hell's bells</b></p> <p>On a visit to America some years ago, my friend Alexander Chancellor took me to dinner with the famous Washington hostess, Susan Mary Alsop, who died last week. I remember it as a bit of a nightmare occasion. </p> <p>Everything was going smoothly enough in the elegant, candlelit Georgetown dining room until our hostess rang a little silver bell, silencing the company and calling upon one of her distinguished guests, a senator, to give his opinion on the current political situation. </p> <p>For the rest of the meal, I sat in terror that at any minute the little silver bell would ring again and I would be invited to pontificate on a matter of topical importance. </p> <p>Luckily, it didn't happen but the apprehension that it might was quite enough to spoil my enjoyment of the evening. </p> <p>The ringing of the bell or its equivalent, the tapping of the spoon on the wine glass, often at the precise moment when people have just begun to have a good time, is guaranteed to spell the end of all fun. </p> <p>It was another famous American, Robert Benchley, who said that the most disagreeable combination of words in the English language was: 'The doctor will see you now.' Agreed. But a close second, as far as I'm concerned, must be: 'Would you care to say a few words?'</p>",
  "<p>The government is facing a row over revelations that the Inland Revenue is charging tax on some compensation payments made to victims of financial mis-selling.</p> <p>Nearly \u00a31 billion has been awarded to victims of endowment mis-selling and millions more are due to people caught up in other financial scandals such as mis-selling of split capital investment trusts. </p> <p>Endowments were sold as tax-free products but the Inland Revenue has confirmed that where part of the compensation payment is interest - representing returns that would have been earned on capital had the investor not put the money into the mis-sold product - people will be taxed at their highest rate of income tax. </p> <p>In the case of endowments, where the average compensation payment has been about \u00a31,600, if the interest element was \u00a3600 a basic rate taxpayer would owe \u00a3120 and a higher rate taxpayer \u00a3240. There are no figures available on how many compensation payments have included interest, or how much. </p> <p>The financial ombudsman and the Financial Services Authority say a minority of people are affected. The ombudsman says interest is usually payable only to people who have surrendered their policies. In some cases endowment companies may have paid the bills. The FSA and the Inland Revenue says that compensation claimants should contact their tax offices if they need help. </p> <p>The FSA is to issue a state ment this week in an attempt to clarify the position. But John Whiting, a partner with the accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that the only answer is for the government to exempt mis-selling payments from tax. </p> <p>Legislation was passed during the Nineties to exempt pensions mis-selling compen sation from tax and Whiting and others believe the government should do the same for other mis-selling victims. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, has written to the Inland Revenue asking it to justify its position. In his letter he described the Revenue's position as 'highly inequitable and arbitrary'. </p> <p>'Surely the test should be that taxation should be no higher [or less] than if the financial products had matured in the normal way.' </p> <p>Whiting said he would be asking the Chartered Institute of Taxation to raise the issue with the government.</p>",
  "<p>Should HBOS bid for Abbey? Consider the numbers: Halifax and Bank of Scotland, as the two banks were known before they merged to become HBOS, have delivered \u00a3807 million in cost savings and additional revenues in three years, \u00a3150m more than promised; Royal Bank of Scotland managed to squeeze \u00a32 billion, almost 50 per cent more than its original estimate, from NatWest following the acquisition in 1999. </p> <p>Should HBOS bid for Abbey? Consider the numbers: since Wm Morrison acquired rival Safeway six months ago, the latter's sales have been plummeting - by 12 per cent in the last three months, according to industry statistics - forcing a first-ever profits warning from the previously much-admired Morrison. </p> <p>That sums up the dilemma facing HBOS chief executive James Crosby as he debates whether or not to enter the battle for Britain's sixth-largest banking group. On the face of it, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. As David Lis, fund manager at Morley, points out, Abbey offers the last big opportunity for consolidation in the over-banked - but highly profitable - British high street. </p> <p>Opinion on whether he can persuade the Competition Commission to clear the deal is divided - the arguments are considered below - if there is even a small chance, he should go for it. After all, if Crosby decides not to go ahead, not only will he be passing up the chance of reaping these savings and, potentially, accelerating its growth, he could also be handing these prizes to Santander Central Hispano (SCH), the Spanish bank that bid \u00a38bn for Abbey last month. </p> <p>Abbey is considerably smaller than NatWest but some say its record of mismanagement and poor cost control is even worse. While analysts will not start making detailed calculations of potential cost savings until HBOS actually launches a bid, they say it should not be difficult to cut Abbey's costs by as much as 30 per cent - equal to about \u00a3500m on Abbey's costs of \u00a31.6bn. Add in the prospects of selling things like Halifax's current account - which has been pulling in customers faster than even it had hoped - to Abbey's 18 million customers, and the potential for growing revenue could be even more attractive. </p> <p>That would please the City: already investors are braced for a slowdown in mortgage lending and consumer borrowing that would make it harder for the banks to maintain their run of record results - combined, they made more than \u00a330 bn in the first half of this year alone. 'It is better for HBOS to buy Abbey, and even pay over the odds, to get growth as we go into a retail slowdown,' said Mark Durling, of brokers Brewin Dolphin. </p> <p>On the face of it, banks are the exception to the rule that most mergers end up costing shareholders money. Apart from HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays' takeover of Woolwich and Lloyds of TSB are seen as being successful deals. </p> <p>But none of these had the degree of overlap that HBOS has with Abbey: at least 540 of Abbey's 741 branches are within a quarter of a mile of a Halifax. Even if HBOS decides to keep the Abbey brand name - as it did when it took over Birmingham Midshires - it would surely have to close a large number of branches to make the deal pay. That would mean big job losses: estimates as high as 12,000 are already doing the rounds, and even half of that would provoke a political outcry. </p> <p>HBOS is fond of pointing out that it employs more people than worked for the two banks before the merger but that deal still cost jobs, despite Bank of Scotland's reputation for parsimony. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest risk, however, is that HBOS goes through the competition inquiry only to acquire a severely weakened Abbey at the other end. </p> <p>John Tyce, banking analyst at SG, pointed to Wm Morrison as an example of how damaging that could be. Like Safeway, Abbey has effectively lost its management team already - finance director Stephen Hester will become chief executive of British Land in the autumn and chief executive Luqman Arnold told SCH he would only stay around for a year and is unlikely to change his mind should HBOS take over. </p> <p>The impact on Safeway of a lack of management and a competition inquiry is clear from Morrison's recent profits warning. While some experts point out that banking is different - its customers rarely visit its branches for a start and changing banks is far harder than changing supermarkets - there is the potential for Abbey to lose what little momentum its recovery programme has already generated. </p> <p>If, as many expect, an HBOS bid prompts some of the other banks to enter the fray, the disruption from an inquiry could be even greater. While none of the other high street banks could realistically hope to be cleared to bid, they could use the inquiry to ensure that, if HBOS is cleared, it is on the worst terms possible. </p> <p>An adviser to one of the banks involved pointed out that when Morrison first bid for Safeway, it expected to have to sell 10 to 20 stores; after the competition inquiry and Sainsbury and Tesco entering the fray, that number rose to 52. </p> <p>When Lloyds TSB was blocked from bidding for Abbey three years ago, the biggest impact on it was on the reputation of the two men at the helm. </p> <p>Ian Harley, then chief executive of Abbey, was castigated for lobbying against the bid: the current management team is keen to be seen to be doing the opposite. </p> <p>For Lloyds TSB chief executive Peter Ellwood, however, the missed deal all but destroyed his credibility. While he spent much of his remaining term at the helm insisting that it could continue to grow and talking up the prospects of a European deal, some felt he was marking time to his retirement. </p> <p>Crosby is much more highly regarded than Ellwood was. He has already pulled off enough successful deals - Clerical Medical and the operating assets of Equitable Life as well as the Bank of Scotland deal - to establish his reputation for making acquisitions. </p> <p>He has also won plaudits for his strategy of growing by giving customers want they want, in the form of interest on current accounts and new deals to tie them into their mortgages instead of being tempted in by other lenders. </p> <p>Even so, some warn that if he bids and is blocked by the competition commission, it could harm his reputation. It could certainly lead analysts to question more closely how HBOS intends to grow its business. </p> <p>Crosby is clearly considering the position carefully: he may only have revealed HBOS's interest on 3 August but he first raised the prospect of a merger with Abbey's Arnold at least three months ago. Still, however, no formal offer has been forthcoming. </p> <p>Analysts are split on the likelihood of him entering the fray, with some putting it as high as 90 per cent; others as low as 60 per cent. </p> <p>No decision is likely for at least a week, but Crosby could well find the chance too good to miss.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners who pushed for Sunday trading 10 years ago are mobilising for a fresh assault on remaining barriers to the full '24/7' trading week.</p> <p>Prompted by interest from leading retailers including Ikea, B&amp;Q and Tesco, they are discussing strategies that could be launched soon after the next general election. </p> <p>'Sooner or later someone will move for a more realistic approach,' said David Ramsden, the former deputy chairman of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, the lead organisation that pushed for Sunday shopping. 'Total deregulation is the only sensible option. The 1994 legislation was a compromise.'</p> <p>Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said it was aware that retailers had been taking soundings to establish what level of support they would have for a move to make Sunday a normal trading day.</p> <p>Debenhams is the latest retailer to test shoppers' mood with a 'browse' hour that will start in October in all its stores that have cafes.

  "<p>British Airways has flown though some turbulent times in its post-privatisation history - the 'dirty tricks' scandal, the ignominy of Bob Ayling's departure, and industrial disputes too numerous to list. But last week's chaotic scenes were by far the worst I can remember, and provoked the most angry outcry from passengers and commentators. </p> <p>There was a quantum change in the reaction to the cancellations and near-anarchy at Heathrow. After the tragedy of September 11, the airline has had a huge fund of goodwill that has seen it through financial problems, thousands of job cuts and serious management failings. Last week, that goodwill seemed to have been spent, amid headlines that accurately reflected the travelling public's frustration at what has happened to BA. Suddenly, the airline seems on a par with the London Underground and the motorway system for public opprobrium. </p> <p>This is probably an over-reaction. As chief executive Rod Eddington points out, up to 2 per cent of flights are cancelled for a variety of reasons on a 'normal' day's flying. The problem last week was that they all hit Heathrow, our busiest airport, at the same time. It confirmed the worst suspicions that the 'Future Size and Shape' programme - which has seen 13,000 jobs go in three years - has cut the airline too close to the bone. And it makes a nonsense of BA's claim that, by paying a few pounds more, passengers can avoid the delays and ritual humiliation of the cut-price competition. </p> <p>Eddington says that the next couple of months will decide what the long-term implications are, and there is no doubting his determination to see the job through and get things right. But if he gets it wrong, it will take more than a stint behind the check-in counter to get him off the hook.</p> <p><strong>The safe way for Crosby to acquire Abbey?</strong></p> <p>The Abbey-Santander situation is being increasingly compared to last year's Morrison's-Safeway affair: an agreed bid, an uncertain reaction from the target's shareholders, and the possibility of a government probe if any of the other bid players get involved by tabling their own offers. </p> <p>In this scenario the apparent risk to HBOS, the bank most likely to table a counter-bid, is from a Competition Commission review that would take months, unsettle Abbey's business, and end up with HBOS getting approval to bid - but with serious conditions attached. Job losses, branch closures, sell-offs of overlapping areas of the business all threaten the financial mathematics of an HBOS-Abbey deal. A year on, this gloomy scenario goes, we could be reading about HBOS's first profits warning and a sliding share price.</p> <p>I don't see it that way. The alternative sequence of events could just as likely see a relatively quick and inexpensive victory for HBOS, with little of that downside: HBOS bids, Santander withdraws (as it has hinted), other potential bidders such as RBS, HSBC and Lloyds TSB get cold feet, and leave the way clear for HBOS. After arguing the toss with the authorities for a few months, James Crosby comes out of the Competition Commission relatively unscathed - a few minor adjustments, maybe - but essentially he gets the whole of the Abbey business at a good price.</p> <p>There are lots of ifs and buts, but the HBOS 'dream scenario' is a real possibility. As long as the Spanish are offering paper, which few shareholders want, the temptation for Crosby will grow more acute.</p> <p><strong>Montague's comeback will test philosophy</strong></p> <p>Welcome back, Robert Montague. The 56-year-old businessman and bon-vivant will this week return to the City after a 10-year absence - more or less enforced - with his Intermodal company. </p> <p>In the early Nineties, Montague was the original 'fat cat', long before the phrase was applied to businessmen. His company Tiphook (like Intermodal, in the container business) fell victim to tough times, and kicked out Montague and some of his pals. They insisted their three-year service contracts (remember them?) should be honoured in full, and walked away with more than \u00a36m.</p> <p>Montague subsequently went bankrupt (partly as a result of his underwriting rights issues to rescue Tiphook) and had to sell his yacht, as well as other treasured personal assets. He came out of bankruptcy seven years ago, determined to get back into the business he knows, and at which for a long time he was very successful.</p> <p>Intermodal will be more of the same - containers - but this time operating largely from the continent. If his past record is anything to go by, he will expand fast, through acquisition, and he deserves a chance. This government has tried to underpin its entrepreneurial credentials by seeking to remove the stigma of bankruptcy, with the message that we all deserve a second chance in business. Montague's return should be viewed as a test-case of that philosophy.</p> <p><strong>The boys in the top band</strong></p> <p>If further proof were needed of the 'glass ceiling' for Britain's businesswomen, it came with yesterday's survey by our sister paper, the Guardian , of executive pay rates. </p> <p>No female executives earned more than \u00a31 million, and even Marjorie Scardino, with a total package of \u00a3901,000, was some way off the 'magic million' club with its all-male membership of 187 executives. Of the 1,400 boardroom jobs going at Britain's top companies, 114 were held by women.</p> <p>So it's still a case of jobs - and the big bucks - for the boys.</p>",
  "<p>British Airways is used to the fickleness of Her Majesty's Press, but even seasoned spin doctors at Waterside were shocked by the venom of the comment after last week's 'cancelled flights' fiasco. Especially, it seems, from the Daily Mail front page 'What a way to run an airline!' If they could have heard the conversation in the gents over at Derry Street, however, they might not have been so surprised. John Bryant, senior production executive on the Mail, was still spitting tacks as he told colleagues about his delayed flight and lost luggage after his return flight from Athens last weekend. There's nothing like personal involvement to sharpen up those news values. </p> <p><strong>Shame on you</strong></p> <p>Oh to have been a fly on the wall at Heathrow last week when BAA chief executive Mike Clasper took a break from working out where to put all those delayed passengers. Clasper was lined up to pose with an 'inflatable poster' (whatever that is) of an athlete leaping over Terminal 1 to publicise BAA's support for London's Olympic bid. There appears to have been a certain amount of rewriting of history afoot at BAA, which would have us believe that its \u00a38 billion investment in Terminal 5 and upgrades at Gatwick and Stansted was made with the 2012 games in mind. Clasper promises a 'high quality, highly efficient experience for the large influx of air travellers for the Olympics'. The award for 'most shameless bandwaggoning' is in the post via air mail. It may be there some time. </p> <p><strong>Sorry, closed</strong></p> <p>To mark the end of August we launch a final silly season project: a hopeless cause campaign. Obviously the best ones have been taken already (see London's Olympic bid, above) but, courage, mes braves, there must be others. A call to the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wheeled into action last week to mark the 10th anniversary of liberalised Sunday shopping, supplies some useful inspiration regarding tactics. 'Bond Pearce, the law firm whose partner Tony Askham helped to draft the legislation, has four offices. I telephoned all of them to ask whether I could make an appointment to see a solicitor on Sunday. Guess what? They do not work on Sundays.' Brilliant. </p> <p><strong>Second glance</strong></p> <p>Can you guess what it is yet? Yes! It is Rolf Harris, contemplating a mega-million pound pay-off for his sterling contribution to animal welfare deemed by some a reward for failure but certainly not by anybody here on Cheapside. Meanwhile, Michael Green attempts to get into character for a new series following the fortunes of injured networks in intensive care. Confused? Even their mothers could not tell them apart. </p> <p><strong>Class ad</strong></p> <p>You get a better class of advertisement in the John Lewis Partnership's internal newspaper, The Gazette. Alongside the details of a Mercedes and two luxury villas in Florida is one that particularly grabs the eye: 'Trakehner Warmblood horses of the very best breeding in the UK. Mainly young stock bred by Partner'. We can only guess at the salaries that sustain hobbies such as this and Cheapside has to leave you at once in order to apply for a job. If we succeed, watch this (empty ) space.</p>",
  "<p><strong> A certain rivalry in the Air</strong></p> <p>To Edinburgh, where the British TV industry gathered this weekend for its annual three-day session of mutual back-slapping and self-congratulatory navel-gazing. </p> <p>There were two huddles at the Film Four party last week. The first centred on Andy Duncan, Channel 4's new chief executive. He was followed around the room so closely by a circle of admirers he must have been reluctant to go to the gents. The second gathered around another blonde-haired media figure - no, not Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson (holding court at the ground-floor bar), but Donna Air, the former Byker Grove star. Air was in Edinburgh to promote her new film. No prizes for guessing who got the most attention from the army of luvvies. </p> <p>Johnson is not backward in coming forward, and he was quick to complain about a recent Sunday Express story illustrated by a picture of him and his girlfriend. Nothing wrong with the story you understand, but the picture in question depicted him with an ex - and that did not go down too well with Mrs Johnson, whom the Channel 4 chairman married this summer.</p> <p><strong> Deals on meals</strong></p> <p>Spotted at Friday night's post-MacTaggart Lecture party: ITV chief executive Charles Allen (below), casually attired in a brown leather jacket, deep in conversation with Scottish Media Group boss Andrew Flanagan.

Either that, or they were complaining about the mushroom vol-au-vents.</p> <p><strong> John's TV hell</strong></p> <p>John Humphrys was still in a sombre mood following his grumpy MacTaggart lecture, telling anyone within earshot about his hellish session of self-imposed TV viewing.

Or listen to the radio, presumably.</p> <p><strong> Working holiday</strong></p> <p>If you thought the docusoap was dead, think again. Rumour has it that Channel 4 is close to commissioning a fly-on-the-wall series set in the Bahamas.

  "He was Ireland's most famous male stripper, who entertained women by removing either the uniform of a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer or the masked garb of a paramilitary. <p>But last Monday David McCormick booked into the presidential suite of Belfast's Hilton Hotel and prepared to kill himself. </p> <p>Five hours after paying the \u00a3400-a-night bill for the Clinton suite, the 22-year-old stripper snorted cocaine, wrenched up a bedroom window with tools from his suitcase and fell to his death on the pavement below. </p> <p>The agency for which McCormick worked, Angels, staged shows for male and female audiences in pubs, clubs and even private homes. The strippers, who included two women, even entertained Johnny Adair at a house his faction of the UDA controlled in Belfast's Lower Shankill estate shortly before Christmas 2003. They were equally popular in IRA redoubts such as Crossmaglen. </p> <p>Ex-RUC officers were so incensed at such use of their old uniforms that they persuaded the force's successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to warn Angels against illegal use of Crown property. The agency, however, has not been prosecuted. </p> <p>In real life McCormick, from Glengormley, operated beyond the law, using and running drugs for big-time dealers. Friends this weekend said his habit and fear of the dealers drove him to his death. </p> <p>One friend said: 'He owed the big-time dealers and others who were aligned to paramilitaries an awful lot of money. Plus, he was into cocaine himself - big time. The habit was costing him hundreds of pounds a day. He was unable to cope with the pressure.' </p> <p>His friends said he could not deal with the constant calls on his mobile phone from drug dealers warning him to pay his bills or else. Police are scanning phone records for calls made in the days before his death. A spokesman said: 'We are still following a number of lines of inquiry.'</p>",
  "<p>I think Hasselhoff means 'rabbits on heat'. I have no idea. Hoff is house in German. My great-great-something-or-other came from Munich - at least that's what my father says. </p> <p>How have I kept my boyish good looks? That's kind of a strange question, coming from a guy. I think I was just blessed with good genes, and I drink a horrific amount of water. I also work out a lot. </p> <p>The work that I've done, I've tried to do from my heart ... even when the show was about a talking car. </p> <p>My guilty pleasure at this point, I guess, is to go home to my screening room with four boxes of popcorn covered in butter and just sit there watching movies for hours. It used to be alcohol, but not any more. </p> <p>Knight Rider was definitely camp. I tried to be cool, but I never took it that seriously. When they asked me what to wear, I said I wanted to be the black knight. I designed all the clothes. </p> <p>I think that children are angels sent to take care of us. When you have a child, you really realise when you're screwing up and when you're doing well. </p> <p>Don't try and figure girls out because you never will. And don't try to be right. You'll never be right. </p> <p>I went to a Catholic school. I was always staying back after school for detention, but I liked the nuns. Did I find nuns sexually mysterious? No, I found priests sexually mysterious. I told my parents. I said: 'Mom, I think the priests are gay,' but nobody bought into that because we were very devout Catholics. Later on, when everything came out into the open, they were quite surprised. </p> <p>My favourite gift of all time was a go-kart. I was 13. </p> <p>I was very shy when I was younger. I gained my confidence by doing musical theatre. It's what I grew up doing since I was seven. Most guys got their swagger from sports; I got mine from being the lead in a play. </p> <p>I have a fear of failure - and a fear of dying without being in a major motion picture [laughs]. I'd love to have been the American James Bond. It's not over yet. </p> <p>I also have a fear when I get on top of a building that I'll jump. I think everybody has that fear. Have I seen the Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee video? No. My wife says I saw it, but I didn't. Someone brought it over. I turned it off. I have too much respect for Pamela. </p> <p>The best part of my tennis game is my first serve. I put a spin on my second serve, but it's completely wimpy. </p> <p>On Baywatch we had a thing called 'The Rolling Six-pack'. When someone would say, 'Rolling!' everyone would go [sharp intake of breath] so you'd see a six-pack. You had to be in shape to be on that show, but it's hard to maintain. </p> <p>The biggest audience we had was 18- to 49-year-old women. We realised there was a huge audience of men who just loved to watch it for the girls, too. And why not? </p> <p>Is it difficult for me to go to the beach? It's difficult for me to go anywhere. </p> <p>My heroes are my father and my mother. They guide me, they still take care of me and they get me back on my feet when I'm feeling self-indulgent or sorry for myself. </p> <p>I don't know if there was an episode of Knight Rider where I didn't use Turbo Boost. </p> <p>I'm still big in Germany.

That's never happened to me before - but they were oversized! I hung them up on the wall but I thought that's a bit cheeky, as you'd say, so I tossed them out. </p> <p>I've learnt not to try and control everything.

But generally laughter is not easily faked or suppressed, and I have to declare (or possibly to admit, because there were numerous witnesses) that I laughed continually throughout <strong> Dodgeball</strong>. It's the first movie by writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose very name must have suggested his vocation, though his humour is of a different kind to the most famous son of Columbus, Ohio. </p> <p>Dodgeball (subtitled A True Underdog Story ) is a fruitful collision between Ealing Studios with its small-is-beautiful ethos and Saturday Night Live at its most rowdy. The simple plot is that Globo-Gym, a gleaming, state-of-the-art health club for wealthy yuppies, plans to buy its run-down neighbour, Average Joe's, a gym populated by eccentric losers. To survive, the owner of Average Joe's must raise $50,000 within 30 days to pay off loans, and the only way out is to win exactly that sum by getting to the finals of the international Dodgeball Championship in Las Vegas. </p> <p>The movie is vulgar, violent, raucous. And full of great one-liners, brilliant slapstick and splendid performances, not least Rip Torn as a foul-mouthed former dodgeball champion, who comes out of retirement to coach Average Joe's team by throwing spanners at them from his wheelchair to sharpen their reactions. There are cameos from Lance Armstrong (serious bad taste here), Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff, and the joke is that, in postmodernist fashion, this isn't just a little guy versus big guy comedy, it's a parody of a little guy versus big guy comedy. If you sit right through the final credits, you'll see its producer, and one of its stars, Ben Stiller, ask: 'Why can't Hollywood handle complexity?' </p> <p>You may recall (I didn't) that the character played by Vin Diesel four years ago in the splendidly scary, modestly budgeted SF horror flick, Pitch Black, was called Riddick. Now Diesel is back as the same galactic thug in <strong> The Chronicles of Riddick</strong>, a more expensive, much inferior picture that is all hardware, indifferent special effects, bone-crunching video-game violence and mythic pomposity. It's set in a universe threatened by a totalitarian horde of fascistic mindbenders called Necromongers from whom only Riddick can save us. He does so with the help of Judi Dench, who plays Aereon, a ghostly creature dressed for Lady Macbeth's mad scene, who materialises from time to time to deliver a portentous series of what we might call Wraith Lectures. </p> <p>Another British dame, Helen Mirren, figures to equally slight effect as the heroine's boss in Garry Marshall's <strong> Raising Helen</strong>, a sentimental comedy that's even more resistible than the same director's Pretty Woman . Kate Hudson is the eponymous heroine whose blooming executive career with a Manhattan model agency is jeopardised when her elder sister and brother-in-law are killed, leaving her as sole guardian of their three children aged six to 15. It is factitious, preposterous, manipulative stuff, far removed from life, and full of those cute romantic montages set to pop tunes that characterise the work of Marshall and his ilk. </p> <p>Helen is so dumb that when she lies to get the kids into a Lutheran school, she believes there is a blood test to see if the kids are genuinely Lutheran. She also thinks Lutheran pastors are celibate, but the school's headmaster, handsome Pastor Dan Jenkins (John Corbett from Sex and the City), soon disabuses her. 'I'm a sexy man, and I know it,' he proclaims. This could be the perfect date movie for young curates and their intended. </p> <p>What did the makers of thrillers do before the invention of the mobile phone? In the sleek Korean movie <strong> Phone</strong>, a psychological thriller-cum-ghost story, a beautiful young journalist gets threatening calls on her mobile after writing a series of articles exposing middle-class men who abuse under-age girls. </p> <p>She changes her phone number and her address, but the calls get worse and odder, and the four-year-old daughter of her closest friend is driven to the brink of insanity when she intercepts one. Who is the caller? The film largely takes place at night and in the rain (though the scene where the little girl answers the phone is set in an austere art museum exhibiting French paintings), and present time, dreams and flashbacks mingle to often puzzling effect. It's an accomplished but rather anonymous picture. </p> <p><strong> Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut</strong>, the outstanding debut of the 27-year-old writer-director Richard Kelly, that appeared here two years ago, returns for a month on the big screen, somewhat revamped and with an additional 20 minutes, before going to video. Like Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (which added 50 minutes to the original version), the new material elucidates without really improving the film. </p> <p><strong>Top five films</strong></p> <p><strong>The Motorcycle Diaries </strong>(15) Fascinating reconstruction of the journey that transformed Che Guevara </p> <p><strong>Fahrenheit 9/11 </strong>(15) Michael Moore's blazing satirical documentary</p> <p><strong>The Village </strong>(12A) Director M Night Shyamalan keeps the aces up his sleeve</p> <p><strong>My Architect </strong>(PG) Louis Kahn's son reviews his father's intriguing life and buildings</p> <p><strong>Fear and Trembling </strong>(12A) Absorbing story of a Belgian woman lost in translation in Tokyo</p>",
  "<p>They call him 'The Kid'. And there is a light in Amir Khan's eyes that all 17-year-olds have, reflecting innocence, wonder and the belief that all things are possible, not qualities always associated with the dangerous business of boxing. Especially when it entails mixing it with men who are older, stronger and far more experienced. </p> <p>Men in the ring do not come much more menacing to the health of a spindly Bolton teenager than the great 33-year-old Cuban Mario Cesar Kindelan Mesa, whom he meets today in the Peresteri Hall in the dusty northern suburbs of Athens for the 60kg Olympic title. He lost on points to Kindelan in the Acropolis Cup in the same ring in May and says: 'I'd never seen him box before. Now I know what to expect. I'll be a totally different fighter this time. I'll be more patient and it'll just be a different fight. </p> <p>'Kindelan is fast and powerful. I sat down with the coaches in the changing room after he beat me and we talked about what went wrong. And one of the things was just rushing, which I've got sorted. I've been studying videos of him. I've been sleeping well and getting rest.' </p> <p>Kindelan has changed too, it seems. 'In the village Kindelan is a totally different person now,' says Khan. 'Every time he sees me he says good luck to me. He says good morning and shakes my hand. I used to think he was an arrogant person. Maybe I've got him a bit worried about me.' Maybe he has. This is a fight that will mark a definitive change in the lives of both of them. </p> <p>Their collision at this stage of their lives provides a succinct commentary on the divisions between amateur boxing and the lurid attractions of the professional game, as well as between socialism and capitalism. This is not an ideological dust-up, though, because neither boxer would demean the occasion like that. Yet there could hardly be a more striking contrast in age, lifestyles and prospects. </p> <p>Kindelan is the finest lightweight in the world, amateur or professional. He has won every tournament he has entered since the Pan American Games of 1999, including Olympic gold in Sydney and three world titles, and, had he not resisted the temptation to earn millions in America, he could be retired in a Miami penthouse by now. Instead he winds up a career he started at the age of 14 and goes home to Holguin to coach, to nod respectfully in the direction of Fidel Castro and be happy with perhaps a clapped-out old banger, a free apartment and a phone that works occasionally. His is a simple life adorned only by achievement. </p> <p>As for Khan, glory, wealth and temptation lie ahead, in roughly that order. Although he has had only a handful of senior contests, for three months the respected law firm of Davies Arnold Cooper have negotiated for him, with the likes of News International, who have contributed to his stay in Athens - and will, no doubt, be telling us all about it in the days to come - and, more pertinently, the promoter Frank Warren. </p> <p>Warren said last week: 'There are professional fighters out there I know he could beat right now. If he turns professional I think he could win a world title at a very young age, no doubt about that.' A source close to Khan told The Observer yesterday: 'Yes, he has been talking to these people but what he will almost certainly do is remain amateur at least until the world championships in Beijing next year and the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006. If he turned pro now, he would be fighting slower, poorer opposition and would risk going backwards. If he stays in the amateurs he would travel the world for the best tournaments, fighting the best boxers, guys he would probably meet later as a pro, and he would be able to grow physically.' </p> <p>Khan said on Friday: 'I'm definitely wanting to go to Beijing for the Olympics in 2008. Reaching the final there is my dream. I've got a good family and personal coach backing me up, and they know the best for me.' He would be just 21 in 2008, a tournament-hardened fighter primed to take on the world's best, paid or unpaid. </p> <p>If he sticks to his convictions, such an amateur career, underpinned by guarantees from any number of willing sponsors and promoters, would prepare him for professional boxing more thoroughly, certainly, than Naseem Hamed, who turned pro at 18, ignoring the lure of the Olympics. The Prince is languishing sullenly now in Sheffield, semi-retired and likely to figure in the headlines as a mere reference point in the media storm that will inevitably accompany Khan's return to Britain this week. </p> <p> 'Naz has said he wants to promote me,' Khan said yesterday. 'Well, that's good of him or anyone to want to help me.' A fourth win on Friday, this time 40-26 on points over the tough Kazakhstani Serik Yeleuov after trailing in the first two rounds, confirmed Khan's status as the find not just of this boxing tournament, but boxing full stop. Whether or not he becomes the youngest British boxer to win an Olympic gold medal - and I think he can do it - or gets silver, he has lit up these games like no lightweight since Sugar Ray Leonard 28 years ago. </p> <p>'I've not really thought how this will change my life,' he says. 'I just want to get these Olympics over with. I know I've got a family supporting me. My mum and sisters and brothers have come, and it's good to see them. I saw my mum for the first time in five months on Thursday. It was brilliant. Like all mothers, she doesn't watch her son box.' </p> <p>It was a reminder that he is still very much his mother's son, but a lethal fighter too. When Robert Mitchum heard that the teenage hustler and actor Robert Evans was going to be dropped from one of his many Fifties B movies, he uttered the words every hopeful star wants to hear: 'The kid stays in the picture.' This kid, against most expectations 16 days ago, is still very much in the picture. </p> <p><em>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Sebastian Coe could not do it. Steve Ovett did not manage it. Steve Cram never even got close. But Kelly Holmes last night completed the greatest double in British athletics history when she added the Olympic 1500 metres gold medal to the 800m she won five days earlier. </p> <p>She sprinted off the final bend to run herself into the record books by becoming the first Briton in 84 years to win both events at the same Olympics. Holmes joined Albert Hill, a First World War veteran and railway worker, who achieved a similar feat at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics. </p> <p>The 34-year-old from Pembury, Kent, overcame blatant attempts by the three Russians in the race to gang up on her by pulling off another stunning triumph. They were clearly concerned about the potent double threat of Holmes's strength and speed. Natalya Yevdokimova appeared to have been told to take the race out as fast as she could in an effort to draw the sting out of Holmes. </p> <p>The former army sergeant employed the tactics she used so successfully in the 800m on Monday when she beat Maria Mutola by dropping towards the back of the field. Yevdokimova ground out the laps in metronomic fashion with Holmes keeping a wary eye on any developments. </p> <p>Even at the gun, reached in 2min 58sec, she was still in eighth place. Then she began picking off her opponents one by one. Finally, with about 60 metres remaining, and Yevdokimova trying to hang on at the front, Holmes moved into overdrive and there was a finality about it. </p> <p>Holmes's body has been oozing power since she arrived here - from the muscular upper torso and sinewy arms to the tiny hips and slim legs. But it never looked more powerful than last night. </p> <p>Tatyana Tomashova, the Russian whose blistering finish was potentially Holmes's greatest threat, was powerless and looked across in despair as the Briton cruised past her. </p> <p>The look of delight on Holmes's face as she crossed the line in 3min:57.90, breaking her own British record set seven years ago, was a joy to behold. This time there were no doubts. 'I just can't believe it,' she said. 'I'm gobsmacked. </p> <p>'Obviously after the 800 it gave me so much confidence and going through the rounds I was feeling quite good. </p> <p>'But the girls were so good in that race and I had to really focus mentally - probably more than any other one because I was tired and focusing was getting harder and harder. Now I can't wait for tonight to have a party. </p> <p>'I was trying to place myself in the right position when I needed to and I was just focusing on where the leaders were. I realised they were pushing it hard so I had to move up. I was aware that if one of them made a break then I would have had it. So I just had to use all my guts and strength to hold on for dear life again when I could feel them coming. </p> <p>'The whole experience has been absolutely amazing. I've trained so hard from when I've been out in Cyprus (at the British training camp) and I've got so many people to thank.' </p> <p>It is the nature of sport that fortunes can change quickly. But none have surely managed it as quickly as Holmes has. Only a month ago in interviews she admitted the pressure was beginning to weigh so heavily on her she feared being crushed under it. </p> <p>'I sometimes feel I'm falling apart,' she said. 'I feel this weight on me. I wake up worrying about the 1500m and go to bed worrying about it. </p> <p>'I'm putting so much pressure on myself because it matters so much to me to succeed. But what can I do? How do you force yourself not to worry about pressure without just worrying more?' </p> <p>Holmes' success in the 800m may have been a surprise, not least to herself, but she was already one of the favourites to win the longer race even before that brilliant triumph. After all, this is the distance she has been aiming for all season, and she only decided to enter the two-lap event last week. </p> <p>Only two women have ever won both the 800m and 1500m titles at an Olympics, both Russians - Tatyana Kazankina in 1976 and Svetlana Masterkova 20 years later. </p> <p>'I said she ran the prefect 800 on Monday and now she has followed it up with the perfect 1500,' said Coe, Holmes's hero who twice in 1980 and 1984 narrowly missed out on the middle-distance double by winning silver in the 800m and gold in the 1500m. </p> <p>'She has hit a rich seam of form and she ran with great confidence and massive authority. She had the great advantage that, when it came to flat out speed, she could beat anybody. The others had to run away from here but she is so well conditioned they were never going to do that.' </p> <p>Holmes is the first British woman to ever win two gold medals at the same Olympics. 'You have to recognise she has just made history,' said Coe. It has come at the right time for her. She would be the first to admit these will be her last Olympics and sometimes you need a situation like that to really focus the mind and confront what you want.' </p> <p>Holmes has achieved her greatest ever triumph on the track that until these Games was the scene of her darkest moment. The last time she competed here at the world championships in 1997 Holmes arrived in the Greek capital as a huge favourite having just set a new British record. </p> <p>It all went terribly wrong within three quarters of a lap of the opening heat when she pulled up injured with an Achilles injury. The name of the country that she once dared not mention is now her favourite destination. </p> <p><em>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>The sprinters have themselves to blame for their events falling into disrepute and disrepair. The damage done in Seoul in 1988 has never been repaired. The drip, drip, drip of repeated drugs offences has left an ineradicable stain. The poverty of the excuses offered in defence of the continuing misdemeanours has rendered the once proud sprinters objects of pity. They can still strut, but that stuff they do is tainted. We can enjoy the peacock primping before the gun goes off, but we can no longer believe the tale of the tape for too many victories come with an asterisk attached. </p> <p>Fortunately, the long-distance runners have more than made amends and provided us with stories both entrancing and uplifting. The greatest race in Sydney saw Haile Gebrselassie smiling exuberantly on the back straight as, after 9,900 metres, he found a kick sufficiently strong to propel him past Paul Tergat. In Athens he has smiled once again. This time not in victory but in dignified defeat, as having given his all in defence of his title he graciously conceded that his youngers were his betters. The time had come to pass on and he did so with no regrets, knowing his compatriots were worthy of his legacy. </p> <p>How Paula Radcliffe must have wished for such a departure. The end of her Olympic career leaves an absence of British long-distance runners. Her passing was a wretched spectacle. Her agony in the marathon being followed by more, and this time unnecessary, agony in the 10,000m. </p> <p>Painful to watch it may have been, but it was instructive because it demonstrated how much more mental the longer races are than those where you have time neither to blink nor think. When the Japanese girl sashayed off into the near distance, the mid distance and then the far side she frazzled what was left of Paula's brain. By doing what Paula was meant to be doing she ensured that Paula wouldn't be doing anything other than falling by the wayside in exhausted disbelief. </p> <p>Radcliffe still probably can't comprehend that someone went earlier than her and still won. In long distance races, as in a stage of the Tour de France, the secret lies in being the last to be first. You need to leave it as late as you can without being too late or, worse arguably because more noticeable, too early. By going earlier than the traditionally earliest of early birds, Mizuki Noguchi ensured that Radcliffe suffered psychologically every much as she did physically. </p> <p>Only long-distance races can inflict that much damage and allow a multiplicity of sub-plots to be played out to their conclusion. And there can be no doubt that the most eagerly awaited of them all was this men's 5000m. </p> <p>There is nothing in sport to match a big night at the Olympic track. It is a carnival of athletic excellence and endeavour. And with Athenians returning from their holidays, there was a packed house to witness it. </p> <p>Arrayed against each other were Kenenisa Bekele (Eth) and Hicham El Guerrouj (Mar). The Ethiopian, having already won a gold at 10,000m, was attempting to become the first man to double up in the 5,000m since Mirutz Yifter in 1980. The Moroccan, having already won a gold at 1,500m, was attempting to become the first man to double up in the 5,000m since Parvo Nurmi in 1924. Almost a surfeit of long-distance history. </p> <p>What's more, there was a strong narrative line. Gebrselassie took up running after listening to Yifter the Shifter's achievements in Moscow on radio. Bekele took up running because of the achievements of Gebrselassie. The Ethiopian line is strong and well established. </p> <p>Yet it was under threat not only from El Guerrouj, perhaps the most graceful runner on the planet, but also the Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge, a man, to add more history, who shares his name with Kipchoge Keino. </p> <p>The last time El Guerrouj and Bekele had confronted each other over 5,000m at the 2003 world championships in Paris, the 19-year-old Kipchoge surprised the favourites and finished inches ahead. </p> <p>Now Bekele set the initial pace, tootling along. Then with nine laps to go the Kenyan Abraham Chebii injected some pace into the race running a 61.46sec lap. His job done, Kipchoge took over. El Guerrouj bided his time, only joining his rivals at the halfway point. </p> <p>With 2,000m to go there were only a couple of yards separating the trio, with another Ethiopian, Gebre Egziabher Gebremariam, in close attendance. They had burned off only half the field but there was no doubt the winner would come from this quartet. </p> <p>Still they played cat and mouse, no one wanting to lose by going early, and the race began at the bell. On the back straight Bekele broke Kipchoge, but El Guerrouj stalked him and some 20m from the line took the lead for the first time and went on to victory. A few metres from the line he held his arms aloft and smiled. After crossing it he signalled, in bug-eyed disbelief, that he had won two track golds at a single Games. </p> <p>The feat was too much for him. Almost immediately he collapsed on the track, cramp preventing him from removing his shoes without assistance. A gaggle of officials and fellow competitors gathered round him to stop and stare. As well they might for it is 80 years since someone else achieved what El Guerrouj did last night. </p> <p><em>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>It has been an incredible week, and I haven't yet had time to sit down and let it all sink in. I haven't even made it back to my own home yet, and today I'm back on my bike, riding the Grand Prix Eddy Merckx time-trial, which takes place near Brussels and is organised by the great man himself. </p> <p>I watched the pursuit yesterday morning on a video at my mother's house in London, where I stayed for about 10 hours between flying in from Athens on Friday night and flying off to Brussels. It's weird, it all seems so long ago because it has all been so intense. I'm still baffled by it all, but I'm kind of getting used to the idea that I've achieved what I set out to do at the start of the year. </p> <p>The madison was an incredible way to end. I thought it was all over when my partner Rob Hayles crashed, had to change his bike and was circling the track not looking particularly good. But he came round, and we were able to choose the right moment to get back into it by regaining the lap we had lost. After that, it was just a matter of hanging on until the finish. </p> <p>There were no celebrations on Wednesday night. I was whisked off to do press, and whisked off again to do Grandstand , so it was 3am before we got to bed. On Thursday morning I went for a walk around Athens with my fiancee Cath, trying to take it all in and figure out the next step. Plus I needed to buy a shirt to go out in, as I didn't have anything. </p> <p>I went out for a beer or three on Thursday night with Steve Cummings and Rob, but it all felt a bit of an anticlimax. A lot of the team had gone home by then, and it was a bit quiet in the Olympic village because everyone else was starting to drift away. </p> <p>I never expected all this attention. In the airport yesterday morning, there were people staring at me, and coming up to shake my hand. The calls from the press just keep coming in, but it's all good news. Apparently the BBC showed more cycling in their Olympic coverage than any other sport, and I've also heard that cycling got more viewers than Match of the Day . It's time cycling got the recognition it deserves as a sport, and, if I can be part of that, it's fine by me. </p> <p>My aim before the Games was to get three medals, but I didn't make any plans about what to do if I actually achieved it, and I didn't really think about the history side of it. People told me that no one had managed three medals for 40 years, but you have to put that to one side and get on with it. </p> <p>And you can't plan for what happens if you win those medals. You daren't. So my priority now is to sit down with the people who advise me, such as Chris Boardman - who has actually been through what I am experiencing now - and my coach Simon Jones, and plan what I want to do with it all. Once I've done that, I'll feel more in control. As it is, it's like being carried along on a whirlwind. </p> <p>This week, it's the Tour of Britain, where I will be leading Credit Agricole, even if I'm not certain how my form will be. The training for the pursuit is all focused on a very short spell of racing at a very high intensity, whereas the stages in the Tour of Britain will be around 100 miles each, and I'll be up against guys like Andreas Kloden, who finished second in the Tour de France. </p> <p> I'm also thinking about next year, because I have to renegotiate my contract with Credit Agricole, which means setting goals for 2005. I'll probably stay with them, because I think I've built up a bit of respect there. I've done what I told them I wanted to do, so I should get the freedom again in future. The plan may well be to go for the prologue time-trial in the Tour de France, try to win the yellow jersey and keep it for a few days. The prologue next year is on a flat route, so I've been told, so that makes sense, and it fits in with what I've shown I can do in the pursuit, a highly intense effort over a few minutes. </p> <p><em>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Norwegian police trying to track down The Scream could do worse than check out the Blackburn Rovers technical area. </p> <p>Graeme Souness was on his feet and incandescent with rage for much of this game, and with good reason. The home side's attempts to hang on to a one-goal lead were hampered first by the unnecessary dismissal of Lorenzo Amoruso 20 minutes from the end, then by a ludicrous four minutes of added time after a goalless and injury-free second half. </p> <p>At the end of the extra period, Alan Smith achieved what had looked beyond Manchester United all afternoon by beating an inspired Brad Friedel, but only after Alan Wiley had failed to spot Louis Saha use his hand to guide Paul Scholes's pass into the striker's path. </p> <p>'There are several things I would love to go into, but it's better not to say anything,' said a Souness protecting his blood pressure and his bank balance. 'It hurts to lose points in that way, but I couldn't honestly say United did not deserve something from the game. But for Brad, they would have equalised before the last minute.' </p> <p>Whatever medication Souness uses obviously works because seconds before this level assessment, his less circumspect assistant, Dean Saunders, said the manager's head was boiling. </p> <p>'It was a blatant handball and we are sick about it,' Saunders said. 'We think the fourth official originally put three minutes on the board until the United manager complained and he changed it to four.' </p> <p>Like United's Cristiano Ronaldo, who now finds it hard to win legitimate penalties because of his reputation for diving, Souness complains too often for his own good. That makes it easy to ignore his tantrums, but it does not mean he is always wrong. He was on solid ground in the first half moaning about the yellow card Amoruso received for standing his ground against Kleberson when the ball had run out of play. The referee did not have to show a card on that occasion, but the fact he did left him no room for manoeuvre when he later had to book Amoruso for a clear foul on Saha. </p> <p>'I'm sure Graeme isn't happy with some of the decisions, but he should be happy with a point from a game we dominated,' Sir Alex Ferguson said. 'We would have won but for a combination of bad misses and fantastic goalkeeping.' </p> <p>This is an accurate summary, for though Friedel performed heroically in keeping out goal-bound efforts from Smith, Kleberson, Ronaldo, Paul Scholes and about half-a-dozen from Saha, most of the shots were straight at him. Ferguson was less reliable in describing Paul Dickov's opener as a scrappy goal from a throw-in and Blackburn's only attempt of the afternoon. </p> <p>In point of fact, it was a well-taken striker's goal, Dickov expertly turning Mikael Silvestre and supplying a clinical finish of the sort United spent the next 70 minutes struggling to match. </p> <p>For much of the game it looked as though the club about to spend around \u00a325 million on Wayne Rooney would be upstaged by a \u00a3150,000 bargain. United fans in the Darwen End had barely completed a chant of 'City reject' when the well-travelled Dickov was suddenly celebrating in front of them. </p> <p>Blackburn were not exactly adventurous after that, but Ferguson overlooked a glorious chance they created 15 minutes from the end when Morten Gamst Pedersen wasted an invitation to mark his debut by making the game safe. </p> <p>Brett Emerton's muscular contribution on the right wing made a nonsense of Souness's decision to leave him out of his starting line-up, and when he capped a barnstorming run with a precise cut back, the Norwegian had time to do better than blast the ball over the bar. </p> <p>Had Pedersen taken his chance, or if the otherwise excellent Amoruso had shown a little more control, Blackburn could have inflicted a second defeat in three games on United. As it is, Ferguson's players have collected just four points from a possible nine, and at the rate Arsenal and Chelsea are going, Rooney may arrive too late to save United's season. </p> <p>'The main thing is that we kept going and took something,' Ferguson said. 'That could be an important point at the end of the season.' He wishes. </p> <p> <strong> Man of the Match</strong> </p> <p><strong> Brad Friedel</strong> While Cristiano Ronaldo and Brett Emerton were the best outfield performers, the goalkeeper's astonishing string of saves had the greatest bearing on the result. United's finishing was not always as crisp as Friedel's reactions, but they would probably have scored earlier against most goalkeepers. </p> <p><em>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>",
  "<p>They may not be totally convincing as potential Champions, but Chelsea beat Southampton more convincingly than the scoreline suggests to make their best start to a season in the top flight. </p> <p>Four games, four victories is a club record at this level, and although Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's men should have won by a bigger margin against a side in turmoil after the departure of manager Paul Sturrock last week, the way they cruised through the game looked ominous for all but the very best in the Premiership. </p> <p>'You can't do better than take 12 points from your first four games,' said Steve Clarke, assistant to Mourinho, who flew out of the country straight after the game. </p> <p>The club insisted that their Portuguese manager is not looking for that final piece in the Chelsea jigsaw, but there is still an element of doubt that his side have enough about them to overtake Arsenal. </p> <p>By Clarke's own admission, Chelsea should have been three or four ahead by half-time, despite falling a goal behind - a wonderful strike from James Beattie - within 12 seconds of kick-off. </p> <p>Yet after equalising, through Beattie again, into his own net, and taking the lead with a Frank Lampard penalty, Chelsea failed to really kill off a Saints side who rarely threatened, but were always in with a chance of snatching a point. </p> <p>Not that they were short of chances, but a combination of wayward finishing, outstanding goalkeeping and goalline clearances kept Chelsea down to a one-goal winning margin for the third weekend running. </p> <p>'Missing chances is not a concern while we are winning games - it might be if we were losing,' added Clarke. </p> <p>Yet an unlikely upset looked briefly possible when Beattie scored that early goal. Chelsea kicked off, but Joe Cole's wayward pass sat up invitingly for the big striker to hit a beautiful volley that dipped over the arching body of Petr Cech and into the net from fully 25 yards. </p> <p>It was a sensational start to the game, the first goal Chelsea had conceded this season, but proved to be a false dawn. Chelsea soon settled into their groove, with Lampard dictating play from the middle of the park and Cole and Didier Drogba looking particularly threatening in the first-half. </p> <p>Eidur Gudjohnsen, in for Mateja Kezman, headed wide from close range, Drogba had a shot blocked by Antti Niemi and Lampard thumped a drive over the bar, all inside the opening 10 minutes. </p> <p>Drogba cut in from the left and had a shot saved from a tight angle. Cole twisted and turned defenders before shooting wide, then had a half-hearted shot cleared off the line. Drogba slid in on a curling Lampard free-kick, but failed to make contact, then miscontrolled a perfect through ball from Cole. </p> <p>With so much possession and pressure on the Southampton goal, it seemed only a matter of time before a Chelsea equaliser, but it came through an unexpected route. </p> <p>Lampard swung in a corner, Gudjohnsen flicked the ball with a heel and it flew off Beattie's hip towards his own goal. Anders Svensson made a valiant effort to clear, but the ball flew up on to the crossbar and down over the line. </p> <p>The goal knocked the stuffing out of Saints. Svensson was in action again, clearing a header from the impressive Tiago off the line, but Chelsea soon had the decisive goal. </p> <p>Another Lampard corner was swung in and Claus Lundekvam handled under pressure from Drogba. Southampton argued that he had been pushed and were still unhappy after Lampard scored from the resulting penalty, claiming he touched the ball twice when he slipped as he struck it. </p> <p>The second half was less one-sided, although Niemi was still the busier keeper, tipping over another potential own goal, this time from Rory Delap, and saving well from Damien Duff and Kezman. </p> <p>A draw would have been more than Southampton deserved and caretaker- manager Steve Wigley admitted: 'I wouldn't like to play Chelsea every week. They will be there or thereabouts at the end of the season.' </p> <p>But thereabouts may not be good enough for Roman Abramovich. </p> <p> <strong> Man of the Match</strong> </p> <p><strong> Frank Lampard</strong> The Chelsea midfielder was the club's player of the season last year and has grown in stature since playing for England in the European Championships. He took control of the game from an early stage, despite a cut eye that would have stopped Henry Cooper and required two stitches, and was dominant throughout. </p> <p><em>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>",
  "<p>The Spanish-speaking journalist at Liverpool's training ground has a burning question for Rafael Benitez, so after waiting until the end of the football discussion, she asks it. The new Liverpool manager's response is to laugh and pat his stomach. 'Thank you for your concern,' he says. 'You can tell all your friends in Spain that I am eating very well in England.' </p> <p>So now you know. People back in Spain do worry about how the man who led Valencia to a league and Uefa Cup double will fare in the Premiership, but they are not doubting his ability to turn Liverpool around or survive the sparring matches with Sir Alex Ferguson. They just think the food might be dodgy. Not to mention the weather. 'All the managers in Spain would like to spend time in England,' Benitez says. 'I'm just not sure how much time, with this weather.' Gastronomically speaking at least Benitez should feel right at home this afternoon on the edge of the black pudding belt at Bolton, especially as he has kept in contact with his old pal Ivan Campo, though one of the things it is always difficult for a complete newcomer to work out is where teams like Bolton fit into the overall scheme of things. If Liverpool win at the Reebok, is it cause for celebration or just par for the course? Would points surrendered to Sam Allardyce be explainable, or would there be repercussions on the Echo 's letters page? </p> <p>Having watched Bolton on video and listened to the scouts' reports, Benitez feels able to pronounce them a useful team, benefiting from a long association with the same manager and methods. If only he could say the same. In addition to managing a new club in a new country, Benitez is still introducing members of the Liverpool team to each other. Today's game could see two more debuts, with Spanish recruits Xabi Alonso and Luis Garcia ready to commence their Premiership careers. Benitez might still be familiarising himself with his new surroundings, but he knows what he wants. 'A new team with a new manager always needs time,' he says. 'Wins buy you that time, if you lose there is more pressure.' </p> <p>Liverpool lost at home in Europe on Tuesday. Defeat by Grazer AK was insignificant in terms of Champions League qualification, but useful in helping Benitez come to a rapid assessment of his players. 'We never controlled the situation on Tuesday, especially after going a goal behind,' he says. 'That was disappointing, but it is important that we know why we lost control. As long as you have an idea of what you want in football, you can put things right. If you can see what is going wrong you can fix it, it is when you don't see the things you are doing badly you have a problem.' </p> <p>Benitez mentions his idea for Liverpool so often it seems remiss not to ask him what it is. There is no secret. 'My idea about football is to find a balance between attack and defence,' he says. 'Teams should not always attack, nor should they always defend. They should be capable of switching between the two, and to do that you have to find players who can play in both areas and who are intelligent enough to know what is required and when. 'In Spain we have a saying, about players and teams who can play all the balls. That means they can play short passes and they can play long balls, as you would expect, but it also means they know when to do it. You might need both styles in the same match. You might want 20 minutes of one and then switch to the other. It is about responding to different opponents and different situations within a game, so that you can stay in control. That is the way I would like Liverpool to play.' </p> <p>And does the manager orchestrate the changes from the dugout, or is the idea to get the team to think things out for themselves? Benitez smiles. 'I am a physical education teacher, I have worked in schools. You soon learn that if you tell people to do a thing they will do it once. Whereas if you teach them how to do something they will do it all the time. It will be automatic then, it will last a whole career. I don't have any special secret other than that. It all comes down to work and time on the training field, and having players who are intelligent enough to understand. 'Time is short, but if the players understand, and I think they will, we will have a good team.' </p> <p><em>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Sharron Davies is on the phone when I arrive at her converted Cotswold barn. Crunching up the gravel drive, past the outhouse that has been turned into a gym (there is no pool), I see her through a plate-glass window, bolt upright on a chair in the middle of her double-height sitting room, indicating with the hand that isn't clamped to the receiver that I should go round to the back door. There, in the bootroom, I'm received by Elliott, her 10-year-old son, who is hostly composure itself. He offers me refreshments - would I like half of his tuna sandwich? - and introduces me to Snoopy, a basset hound whose party trick, soon demonstrated, is to look excited (ie stand up) when the biscuit tin is rattled. </p> <p>Elliott fills me in. His stepfather of two years, BA pilot Captain Tony Kingston, has just left, his jumbo bound for Lagos. His mum got back from Athens, where she was co-presenting the Olympic swimming coverage, after midnight. And the phone has been going mad all morning. Neither he nor Grace, his five-year-old sister, were allowed to accompany their mum, though she has promised to take them to Beijing in 2008. Not too surprisingly, Elliott loves sport, especially archery and rugby. He plays on the wing. Like his father, the former Olympic 400m runner Derek Redmond, he's fast. </p> <p>The phone conversation goes on and on in the distance. When I tiptoe through the sitting room en route to the guest loo the tone is distinctly agitated. Ooh, hang on, there's a bit of an aquatic theme going on in here: sea-life stencilled on the loo seat, china mermaids on the wall, starfish by the soap. Because Davies, 41, is five foot eleven, I can only see the very top of my head in the mirror over the handbasin. </p> <p>When Davies finally joins us in the kitchen, she explains she was talking to Neil Adams, a judo champion she was engaged to briefly, 23 years ago. A tabloid has rung him up, hunting for dirt on her. They're on good terms, and he thought she might like to know. She's fed up, frankly. It has all got a bit out of hand. </p> <p>Perhaps you missed it, but a few tabloids found the goings-on in Davies' selection of tight sleeveless tops almost as thrilling as those in the Olympic Aquatic Centre. It was reported that the BBC had decided to censor her chest (which is, after all, a magnificent sight - as indeed is the rest of her: deep tan, scooped-out midriff rising slinkily from hipster jeans, shoulders as broad and square as a baronial mantelpiece. She long ago owned up to a boob job, and the surgeon must be very proud). </p> <p>'Oh, don't,' she sighs. 'One day I wore a jacket because it was cold, and the papers decided to say the BBC had told me to cover up. The next day we had a camera lady who decide to shoot me from the shoulders up, just to frame the picture differently. Not once did the BBC ever give me instructions to change anything. Look, it's 98 degrees. What do people expect me to wear? A balaclava? It's so silly.' </p> <p>It is, it is, but as she talks, it's obvious that she's finding it difficult to put the whole story into perspective. 'It got to the point where I felt it was overshadowing the swimmers. I felt the story was about my nipples, rather than the swimming. And I was upset, because I thought I was doing a reasonable job, but then it all became a bit negative, and people only seemed interested in what I was or wasn't wearing.' </p> <p>Well, I think she's overstating it slightly, but there's little doubt that if the British swimmers had done better in the pool, audiences would not have been quite so eager for distraction. Davies, like everyone else who assumed that the new coach Bill Sweetenham had miracles up his sleeve, is disappointed that the team came home with only two medals instead of the five it had been tipped to win. 'At training camp, it was very optimistic, team spirit was extremely good. But it just didn't work for them. The first two, three days of the games, things just didn't work. Men's breaststroke didn't go right, women's backstroke... nothing went their way.' </p> <p>As far as she's concerned, the training schedule was badly flawed. 'Bill Sweetenham just goes slightly too far sometimes... Everyone peaked for the trials in April, and then not everyone had enough time to get back up to speed again.' Davies advocates copying the Americans and holding the trials only a month before competitions. 'The Americans don't have to come down and then work themselves back up again. And I think it would be worth us trying that, so our swimmers don't have time to drop off and lose form.' </p> <p>A key Sweetenham tactic has been to plane the corners off individual swimmers, concentrating on building a hermetically sealed unit almost entirely shielded from media interest, and she thinks this is a mistake as well. 'I would like to see swimmers getting some of the publicity that they're due because then it helps them to build their profile, get sponsorship. Whereas Bill Sweetenham seems to be becoming the star, rather than allowing the swimmers to become the stars. I'm a big believer that when you stand on the block in swimming, you're performing as an individual. You're not a team. As much as it's good to be part of a strong team, you need to have faith in your own abilities and training and build-up. If people are successful, great, that's contagious; but if they're not, that's contagious too.' </p> <p>Not only were the British swimmers barricaded in against the press, they were also cut off from the rest of the Olympic experience. On the day of the men's coxless four, for example, it was training as usual, when Davies feels they deserved a morale-boosting jolly out at Schinias. 'The swimmers were part of Team GB out there, and they should have been allowed to experience that,' she says, drumming her French manicure irritatedly on the pine kitchen table. 'He kept them under very, very tight control. He treated them as children, and they're not: many are in their late twenties, even their early thirties. I think he needs to give them a bit more respect.' </p> <p>Davies knows exactly what it's like to be a child in sport. She measures out her life in Olympic Games: Athens was her seventh. She has swum in three and broadcast from four, 'So I'm now officially more a presenter than a swimmer.' Her first Olympic memory is of sitting in front of the telly, at home in Plymouth, watching Mark Spitz in Munich when she was nine and already training competitively at the local pool. ('This is quite good, this is seven gold medals, I'd like to do this.') Four years later, she was the youngest member of the British team at Montreal; and at the Moscow Olympics in 1980, with a double Commonweath gold to her name, she took silver in the individual medley, touching the wall 10 seconds behind the East German Petra Schneider who has subsequently admitted using anabolic steroids. Davies seems to have abandoned her campaign to have the gold reallocated, though it still hurts that the official records carry no asterisk by Schneider's name to acknowledge her disgrace. </p> <p>Gold and silver medallist met up again four years ago. It was a distressing experience. As a consequence of the state-sponsored doping programme, Schneider has heart problems and, though she has one child, is unable to have any more. 'They are very poorly, a lot of those East German athletes, because no one cared what they were filling them up with. Petra has paid very severely, and it wasn't really her fault. She had very little choice. Had I been East German, I probably would have done exactly the same thing. I never had a problem with her as an individual, it was the system that was wrong, and the International Olympic Committee, who chose to turn a blind eye to it.' </p> <p>In any case, by the time the 17-year-old Davies won that silver, she had already fallen out of love with the sport. She swears that as she touched the wall, she looked up and thought: 'Thank God I can stop now.' Up until the point where she won double gold at the 1978 Commonweath Games, swimming had been pure enjoyment. 'I loved every minute until I won those medals.' What changed? In the wake of that high-profile success, she didn't enjoy the pressure of expectation, and then she started to wish she was a different sort of teenager, one who might be allowed to go to a party or watch a US cop show occasionally, rather than having to spend every evening being shouted at by her dad as she ploughed up and down a cool blue lane. </p> <p>'I remember really wanting to talk about Starsky and Hutch, but I never could because I never saw it. When you're totally ostracised by all your peers because you don't know what you're talking about, it's quite a big deal.' So the Olympic medal was a relief, because it meant she could stop with honour and move into the media (over the years, she's done kids' shows, parenting shows, Gladiators, and, disastrously, The Big Breakfast). From the moment the 10-year-old Davies thrashed a poolful of 18-year-olds at the senior county championships, the family had invested everything in her swimming career. Money had been siphoned off for travel, experts' fees and equipment, rather than for new washing machines or holidays. Terry Davies, her dad, had barely spent any time with her younger twin brothers, one of whom showed promise as a middle-distance runner. 'I felt like I owed my family the medal. Once I'd got it I could stop.' </p> <p>Terry Davies had been invalided out of the navy after a cataract impaired his vision. He experimented with self-employment: farming chickens, rabbits, mushrooms. After his daughter started winning, he became your garden-variety pushy dad. Ringing up famous American coaches for advice was only the beginning. On one occasion, Sharron broke both arms falling out of a tree, but Terry simply bound the casts in carrier bags and told her to rest them on a float during training sessions. Elliott may be showing sporting promise now but his mother won't be forcing the issue. 'I won't make the same mistakes that my dad made. He pushed so hard, he actually knocked a lot of the enthusiasm for the sport out of me.' </p> <p>Until three months ago, Davies's British individual medley record remained unsurpassed. I wonder how she felt when she heard that, 25 years after she had set it, Rebecca Cooke had beaten her time. Ever the breezy professional, she puts a gloss on it initially. 'My time would still have put me in the Olympic final. But British medley swimming should have surpassed that 10 years ago at least.' </p> <p>The phone rings again, and Elliott goes off to deflect yet another inquiry about his mother's bosom; ping! goes the microwave, telling Davies her cup of coffee is ready. (Only a sportsperson could microwave coffee.) 'But if I'm really honest,' she relents, 'yes, there's a part of me that goes, \"Damn.\" Daley [Thompson]'s Olympic record went this week after 20 years and I know that, deep down, he went, \"Oh bugger.\" But that's sport: things have to move on. And, from a selfish point of view, if the sport of swimming grows, then I get more work.'</p>",
  "<p>Britain's pockets of acute poverty and deprivation need one essential ingredient if they are to be revived, according to Bruce Katz, leading American academic and expert on urban regeneration. Rich people. </p> <p>Katz, vice-president of the Brookings Institution and visiting professor at the London School of Economics, advocates attracting a sprinkling of rich people to transform such areas into 'neighbourhoods of choice'. </p> <p>Get well-off people to move to sink estates and they start to attract other services such as shops, schools, health centres and transport, Katz argues. Soon, the attitudes of the original residents begin to change as well, from despair or a grim ambition to get out of the place, to pride and ambition. </p> <p>Attracting rich people to a poverty trap is difficult but not impossible, Katz says. The key is to identify and exploit some hidden benefit, such as location close to a city centre, the presence of water or architectural heritage. He argued his case recently at the centenary celebrations of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, one of Britain's leading research institutions into the roots of poverty and the owner of New Earswick, a garden village on the edge of York. </p> <p>'In the US we believe that areas of concentrated poverty lead to a variety of ill effects on health, schools and transport,' he says. </p> <p>The picture is a familiar one: the concrete monster estate peopled by 'problem families', where the police never go except in armed-response teams. No shops, no pubs, no facilities except a 'council drop-in club' with windows covered by steel shutters. </p> <p>Gradually, such estates are being demolished and rebuilt to the latest 'new urbanist' or 'home zone' principles. The big question is how to bring the well-heeled, who can choose where they live, to a place of ill repute, even if it has been rebuilt with sleek modern buildings. </p> <p>'The answer is location,' Katz says. 'Some of these developments are on sites that have many amenities - a river or proximity to a central business district or some special architectural heritage. The main problem is usually transport - if they are completely isolated you do have difficulties, but if you have location you can trump the disadvantages.' </p> <p>In London, some grim areas are being transformed by the introduction of wealth. In Deptford, for example, the notorious Pepys estate is being rebuilt - and one of its towers is being refurbished for rich clients of Berkeley Homes. The tower's location on the River Thames is the bait that will bring them in. </p> <p>Further south, the Ferrier estate is a brutalist concrete monster that is about to be demolished and replaced by low-rise housing. Luckily, the Ferrier estate is on the edge of sophisticated Blackheath - a bit of judicious rebranding may save it. More importantly, the new houses and flats, instead of all being rented, will be available to buy, rent or through shared ownership. And there will be no identifiable social housing - it will be 'pepperpotted' around the site. </p> <p>Many of the ideas proposed for the Ferrier estate derive from the successful regeneration of one of the most deprived estates in St Louis, Missouri in the US. </p> <p>The area used to be an economic wasteland: no shops, a failing elementary school, rife with drugs and dangerous to visit after dark. Even the name was redolent of urban degeneration - the George L Vaughn High Rises. </p> <p>The luckless residents were crammed into four nine-storey blocks of the worst kind of 1950s architecture - vast, featureless, impersonal. </p> <p>The regeneration programme was total. 'The former public housing towers were torn down and replaced with smaller houses that were economically mixed, with huge success,' Katz says. </p> <p>To remove the stigma, the place was renamed Murphy Park. George L Vaughn was consigned to history. The latest 'new urbanist' principles were applied to create 'defensible spaces' where the residents feel they have control over what goes on in the immediate vicinity. </p> <p>The architecture is traditional and attractive but, crucially, median household income on Murphy Park is up: 10 per cent of the residents earn more than $50,000 a year, three times the official US poverty level. Unemployment is down and crime has largely disappeared. Prosperity is driving the regeneration. </p> <p>Now new houses are being built for sale and new offices, shops and workshops are springing up. The local elementary school was modernised with the latest technology and a new principal with real clout.

  "<p>MY Woolwich Open Plan debit card was damaged so early in July I ordered a replacement. Nothing arrived but, three weeks later, my old card was rejected when I tried to buy petrol. I discovered that the new card had been stolen in the post and \u00a311,500 taken from my current account, which is linked to my mortgage, using up all my credit. Woolwich says it cannot delete these entries until they have been fully investigated, but this could take months and meanwhile it will do nothing to help.

I'm desperate.<br><strong>DM, Loughton</strong> </p> <p>The thief used your debit card to buy foreign currency at a bureau de change. This is a common scam as foreign currency can be converted back to sterling, leaving no fingerprints. Before handing over large amounts, bureaux de change should demand two forms of identity, but these can be forged. </p> <p>The Woolwich softened when I explained that you needed the credit restored because you had large wedding and holiday bills to pay. When you produced invoices to prove the point, the bank restored your full credit limit within 24 hours.

  "<p>Last week 'the UK's leading Orange dealer' texted me the offer of a free mobile upgrade. I phoned back - and got its IVR (interactive voice response) system. </p> <p>Oh God. First a long promotion spiel, then four options to select from: 'If you are a pay-monthly contract customer whose phone is more than 11 months old and you would like to speak with a friendly upgrade adviser about upgrading to one of the new generation of colour camera phones entirely free of charge, press 1. If ...' </p> <p>I pressed 2 - only to get a second level of recorded response: 'To enable us to give you information on our latest phones and tariffs, please state your name, your phone number and the expiry date of your contract so that...' </p> <p>No - definitely not. Life's too short. I want to talk to a person, not be patronised by a machine. The company approached me - there's a limit to the amount of time and effort I'll spend even for a free offer. And I haven't thought about the contract for years. I haven't a clue about the details. That's their job! </p> <p>This is a small example, but it sums up why IVR is the most hated management invention of modern times, despised by everyone including, no doubt, when they experience it from the other end, the managers who eagerly install it in their businesses. It is also one of the most misguided and counterproductive. </p> <p>So how come managers are so keen to use it? The short answer is that they believe automation will cut the cost of providing service. By having customers auto-sort and filter calls as they come in, they think they can minimise the amount of expensive people-resource devoted to answering questions, and maximise the time they spend selling. </p> <p>But the calculation is wrong in every respect. IVR is sold as an IT 'solution', and like any number of such 'solutions' the main thing it solves is the IT firms' need to make sales. Far from containing costs it generally raises them - and worsens service. Companies, and certainly customers, would be better off without it. </p> <p>Let's go back to the beginning. What is the problem that IVR is supposed to be a solution to? The key issue in service is dealing with variety - amplified by the fact that the service is 'co-produced' in real time with the customer. My mobile query could have to do with any number of phone makes, types and tariffs, and I have no idea what my contract is. And I don't want a colour camera phone, I want a headset. Although I might check the tariff too while I'm about it. </p> <p>It's impossible to sort calls according to all the possible variables - nor should you try. Arbitrary categories, as in this case, simply create confusion (what do I do if none of the options fits my query/queries?) or resistance (I'm buggered if I'm doing any more of this). In the first case the result is unnecessary work (I press any old button, explain my query to the wrong person who has to pass me to another), which means extra cost; in the second, non-completion - I drop out. This means lost sales, which of course managers can't see. </p> <p>All this happens because the menu options are invariably not designed according to demand - what matters to the customer - but according to supply - what matters to a remote marketing department. Using a device that customers hate is already courtroom evidence of a producer's rather than a customer's mentality. </p> <p>The irony is that we both want the same thing: smooth service that helps me get most value out of my mobile phone. But you wouldn't know it, because the robotised menu sets up an artificial opposition between the two: it prevents me getting the service I require. </p> <p>Computers are great at routine and hopeless at variety. People, on the other hand, are wonderful at variety and bored and demoralised by routine. So what does IVR do? With the utmost perversity, it uses both people and computers for what they are worst at. It is therefore not surprising that it irritates the hell out of customers too - a full house of dysfunctionality. </p> <p>What matters to me is having my questions answered and my order taken in the shortest possible time, in one call. The best way for the company to do this is to reverse the usual thinking, get rid of the IVR filter and put its best 'upgrade advisers' on the frontline phones, where they belong. </p> <p>For most companies, this is counterintuitive, because they are obsessed with people-costs. They measure people to death with activity measures like time to respond, call duration, numbers of calls a day. But these are unrelated to the purpose of the activity - in this case selling phones, accessories and minutes - and therefore offer no guidance on how to do it better. </p> <p>Meanwhile, they ignore the other costs - for example, of non-completers (like me) and customers who consume extra resources by having to ring a sec ond or third time. These are often substantial. </p> <p>Unlike computers, people can relate to customers and pick up on these things. They can report back and adjust the offering accordingly. By stopping callers dropping out, they increase chances of making a sale; by answering their questions first time, they prevent unwanted follow-on calls. The first increases revenues, the second effectively increases capacity. And you can further reduce costs by ending the IVR contract that you no longer need. </p> <p>So - select from the following options: if you want to improve service, increase sales and cut costs, press button one and delete your IVR... </p> <p>There are no further options.</p> <p><strong>Hanging on the telephone</strong></p> <p>Managers are addicted to IT 'solutions' such as interactive voice response, says consultant John Seddon, because they fit with the unspoken 'command-and-control' mindset. They love the idea of being able to monitor and control their people and measure their activity every which way. </p> <p>But that's a feature, not necessarily a benefit - a can-have isn't the same as a must-have. Most of the variability of performance between individuals in the same system is due to the system, not the people: so measuring all that human activity is missing the main point. Meanwhile, the main point - the system - in many companies is held in an iron grip by their IT suppliers. In effect, companies have become prisoners of their own computer systems, which make it impossible to change business methods without further large IT investment.</p> <p>IVR isn't alone in worsening service and raising costs. For instance, to cut costs banks took routine calls out of branches and set up call centres. They saw an increase in calls as a sign of success. It wasn't.</p> <p>Many callers were asking for explanation, complaining and following up unfinished business - calls which ideally wouldn't occur. The call centres and their IT systems were hiding and building these costs in. In the long run a better and cheaper solution is to remove the causes of the calls in the first place - then companies can get rid of the call centres too.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>If it's a quiet life you're after, don't apply. Merrill Lynch has been advertising for an employment lawyer, but the successful applicant shouldn't expect an easy ride. The investment bank's legal department has been busy of late, and things are about to get even busier. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Merrill resumes its defence against Stephanie Villalba, formerly one of its senior London managers, who has brought an employment tribunal action against the firm alleging unfair dismissal, sexual discrimination, victimisation and unequal pay. </p> <p>Villalba claims she was 'bullied, belittled and undermined' by her boss, and her allegations of sexist misbehaviour at Merrill were gleefully publicised by the press before proceedings adjourned in June. Now comes the cross-examination of Villalba herself, almost certainly guaranteeing more painful coverage. </p> <p>Merrill strongly denies her allegations. It is putting up no fewer than 22 of its own people as potential witnesses to support its case. Many of these come from the uppermost echelons of Merrill and will be jetting across the Atlantic just for this encounter at a Croydon employment tribunal. The south London suburb may seem an unlikely place for a major US bank to stake its reputation, but that is exactly what Merrill is doing. </p> <p>It probably has no choice but to take Villalba's claim seriously. Not just because she was a senior figure in the bank, running its private client business across the whole of Europe, nor simply because she is demanding record-breaking damages of around $13 million; Merrill will want to make sure it offers no encouragement to other disgruntled employees who are minded to bring a claim. </p> <p>The figures suggest there may be quite a few of those. More than 20 women in the UK have brought discrimination claims against Merrill since 1999 - more than any other big investment bank. Not only that: Merrill is still reeling from a nightmare of employment litigation in America. The firm has paid more than $100m to settle a long-running arbitration action involving hundreds of its women brokers, who claimed they were paid and promoted less than their male colleagues. </p> <p>Some are still pursuing the bank. Nancy Thomas, who worked for Merrill in New York and Atlanta, alleges she was routinely subjected to lewd behaviour by male colleagues, including one who forcefully left a dildo at her desk. Meanwhile, Valery and Janine Craane, a high-flying mother-and-daughter team of brokers in the firm's New York office, claim that over a period of years they were persistently overlooked by bosses when lucrative work was apportioned. </p> <p>Everybody knows that claims like these generate damaging publicity and potential recruitment problems. Merrill stresses it has made great efforts to embrace diversity in recent years. </p> <p>But its troubles in the US raise a question that is applicable to all international banks. If so many female workers are disaffected in Wall Street, how much worse might it be in London - where workplace sexism, most observers agree, tends to be more, rather than less, prevalent? </p> <p>According to Britain's Equal Opportunities Commission women in financial services are still earning 43 per cent less on average than their male counterparts - a pay gap more than twice as wide as the national average. And the separate case of Elizabeth Weston suggests that unreconstructed attitudes are alive and well in parts of the City. Weston recently won \u00a31m out of court after comments were made about her sex life and the size of her breasts at an office Christmas party. Guess which firm she worked for? Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>Villalba's claim, though, is potentially more dangerous for the bank. As much as the media have focused on the lurid aspects of the case - allegations of groping and sexist remarks - the central point is whether she was underpaid, hindered and ultimately forced out because she was a woman. </p> <p>In remarks reminiscent of the Craanes' US complaint, Villalba told the tribunal in June that Merrill was 'institutionally sexist'. She added: 'The problem is not the view of individual managers but the whole culture of the management team.' </p> <p>Merrill refutes this, citing several examples of other women who are thriving at the firm. It says that Villalba's division lost $47m in 2000, and that colleagues criticized her management style: 'She was out of her depth in a key role and for the sake of the business had to be replaced. It had nothing to do with her being a woman.' Merrill also says it offered her other jobs within the firm, which she turned down. </p> <p>But the bank will be required to defend these points if it is to win the argument. Villalba's alleged losses have to be viewed in the context of the dotcom crash and depressed markets; and in any case her legal team are contesting the $47m figure. They have demanded access to internal accounts and - intriguingly - the pay arrangements of her former male peers. Merrill has fiercely resisted giving away too many of these sensitive details but the tribunal in sexism cases effectively requires it to prove it did not discriminate. </p> <p>Beyond the Villalba case, banks will probably face more and more claims like this. Discrimination on the grounds of religion and sexual orientation has recently been outlawed; new legislation against age discrimination comes into force in 2006. </p> <p>In the City, where six-figure salaries are routine and tribunals tend to fix compensation accordingly, it could all get very expensive.</p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be the end of civilisation as we knew it. The campaign to extend shopping hours to Sunday was so controversial that it was the only issue Margaret Thatcher failed to get past the House of Commons. Poll tax, yes; Sunday shopping, a step too far. </p> <p>A decade after the lobbyists forced a change in the law, the idea of Sunday as a day of consumer abstinence would not compute with the new generation of shoppers. Anybody who has been on a weekend city break to a continental fashion haven such as Milan or Rome will have been astonished to find that from Saturday at 5pm to Monday at 3pm it is impossible to find anywhere decent to shop. </p> <p>Has it been a victory, then, for the retailers? The British Retail Consortium says it has. 'Sunday is the second most popular day for shopping. The people who said it would not work look pretty silly now,' says director of communications David Southwell. </p> <p>He recalls the situation a decade ago. 'Society had changed. Women were a major part of the workforce and the idea of getting the shopping done midweek was an anachronism. We were a multi-faith society. Retail had become a leisure activity; it was not just about \"chore shopping\". Everything was changing - that is why it happened when it did, and that is why it is successful now.' </p> <p>Nicole Lander, now the director of communications at Woolworths, was instrumental in the liberalisation campaign, establishing the National Association of Sunday Shopworkers and the National Association of Sunday Shoppers to bang the drum because the main union, Usdaw, was initially opposed to any change in legislation. </p> <p>'Retailers like B&amp;Q found every single loophole in the law,' she recalls. 'One of the issues was that more women worked part-time in this country than anywhere else in Europe and we said it was sexual discrimination to prevent them working on Sundays. It got as far as the House of Lords but failed there. The point was that it was not about imposing change on society - society itself had changed. Working women [only] had Saturday morning to do the family shop. It did not make sense. </p> <p>'The religious case for preserving Sunday as a day of rest was a strong and serious one. However, there were fewer than 1 million practising Christians even then - and people don't have to go shopping.' </p> <p>David Ramsden was the deputy chairman of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, the lead campaign group at the time. He was head of public affairs at Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, and together with Tony Askham, a lawyer, set about devising ways to test the 1950 Shops Act. The act, in essence, prevented Sunday trading on the grounds that it was damaging to workers. There were various exemptions, the key ones being perishables, including newspapers, and 'motoring accessories'. </p> <p>'There was a sort of circus that went around the county courts of England,' Ramsden recalls. 'The classic tests were that it was possible to buy a pornographic magazine from a newsagent but not a Bible. There was a furniture retailer that started selling bags of carrots for hundreds of pounds in order to give away a \"free\" lounge suite. </p> <p>'Motoring accessories were exempt, so one northern DIY firm built a caravan and fitted it out with everything they sold, even guttering, to demonstrate that they were exempt under the act.' </p> <p>Anomalies were springing up across the country. Shrewsbury County Court ruled that the 1950 act was 'not proportionate' because there were other ways to protect workers from being exploited. </p> <p>To cut a long legal story short, the campaign was eventually successful less because the retailers won the technical argument and more because public and political opinion shifted. </p> <p>'The government was so embarrassed that they moved to change the law,' Ramsden says. 'The Shopping Hours Reform Council won the support of Usdaw, which had sat down with Tesco by then. Many of Usdaw's members were in convenience stores and they wanted unlimited trading. Lots of their members working in supermarkets were saying that they wanted to be able to work on Sunday. </p> <p>'In the end a compromise was reached. The six consecutive hours between 10 and six o'clock was a sop to the Keep Sunday Special lobby and workers were protected by being automatically opted out of Sunday trading. They had to volunteer to opt in. Many did because they were paid premium rates.' </p> <p>Since then, retailers have pushed the barriers, says Usdaw. Premium rates by and large are being phased out as the number of employees whose contracts predate 1994 dwindles. </p> <p>Supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury keep trading all day on Sunday through their recent move into small, convenience stores. Their garage forecourts are deliberately kept below the 3,000 sq ft limit on trading area. </p> <p>Usdaw's spokesman, Kevin Hegarty, says: 'We predicted at the time that within months the premium rates and voluntary agreements would be eroded - and that happened. It will be interesting to see what retailers who want to extend opening beyond six hours will do. There is already a \"browsing\" hour, which is against the spirit of the 1994 legislation. You still have to have staff in for that.' </p> <p>The Keep Sunday Special campaign, which at the time spoke for all those who thought that workers and shoppers alike needed a day off, has effectively been in mothballs since it lost the fight. To mark the tenth anniversary of the defeat, the campaign commissioned a survey from NOP, which found that 71 per cent of nearly 2,000 respondents would not mind if the larger stores were closed so long as convenience stores were open. </p> <p>The campaign's spokesman, John Alexander, admits that, yes, in the intervening decade he has been shopping on a Sunday. 'We have changed our focus,' he says. 'We are concentrating on the impact on family life. Three million children do not regularly see either of their parents, or their sole parent, at weekends.' </p> <p>The campaign's chairman, Dr Michael Schluter, says: 'The time has come now for the people of this country to admit we made a mistake allowing Sunday work to become normal for so many people. We need a new act to guarantee a shared weekly day off for everyone.' </p> <p>His is a lone voice. Alexander says: 'One of the most disappointing developments has been to see John Lewis, once one of our greatest supporters, do a U-turn'. </p> <p>Gareth Thomas, director of retail operations for the John Lewis Partnership, defends the decision to open the doors. 'We live in the real world,' he says. </p> <p>'Retailing is extremely competitive. Sundays have grown as a day on which our customers choose to do their shopping. We have to react as positively as we can. There are five shops which do not open on Sundays, but by next year they all will.' </p> <p>The BRC's Southwell summarises the impact on retailers. 'Shops have probably not increased their sales by opening on Sunday. You [only] do one family shop a week. But they have removed a barrier to spending by being open. If you have \u00a330 to spend and you can't shop on Sunday, you may take that money to the cinema or the pub instead.' </p> <p>Nothing stands still and, Keep Sunday Special notwithstanding, there is no expectation that society will accept a return to six-days-a-week trading. In fact, majority opinion is that more liberalisation is inevitable. On past performance, that should be a battle royal.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who thinks Jose Mourinho cares for nothing but big-money signings and instant trophies should have seen him on Thursday morning. It may seem unremarkable that he was watching Chelsea go through their paces but the players on view were not Didier Drogba, Ricardo Carvalho and company but the under-13s. Several miles from his first-team base Mourinho was taking in everything from behind one goal. </p> <p>\"That's the second time he's been down here in two weeks,\" said Chelsea's academy director Neil Bath. Mourinho had to leave before the end of the youngsters' game against Ajax but will doubtless be back before long. And not just because the first team hope to move to the same training centre as the academy at Cobham, Surrey, at the end of October. </p> <p>Whereas Mourinho's predecessor, Claudio Ranieri, had the Italian mentality that nothing mattered except the first team, the current manager is from a Portuguese background where developing homegrown players is a way of life. Chelsea may not require talent to sell in the way Porto did but Mourinho's commitment to the academy has been plain in more than his visits. </p> <p>\"Jose's produced a document for the [academy] coaching staff and scouting staff which sets out the philosophy he'd like to see,\" said Bath. \"He's very clear about the type of player he'd like coming though and what he wants to see with the young boys, particularly at the older end when they're starting to progress to the reserves and first team. </p> <p>\"He fully understands that the needs and requirements of seven- to 13-year-olds will be different and he likes the practice we're doing with the younger ages. </p> <p>\"He wants players who are physically, technically and tactically capable of playing in the first team and have experienced the systems of play and the typical training methods that he implements for the first team. </p> <p>\"So we have spent time watching his training sessions and reading up on his philosophy. Our role is to ensure that when a young player does get an opportunity they're aware of what's coming because they will have experienced it.\" </p> <p>Part of Mourinho's brief when he came to Chelsea was to oversee an improvement in the academy. Though Roman Abramovich could afford endless spending sprees, the club wants a structure that will lessen the dependence on a chequebook. </p> <p>The fact that Chelsea hosted Thursday's Premier League academy under-13 event, which also featured Ajax, Celta Vigo, Bayer Leverkusen, Fulham and Liverpool, showed a different side to the club from the moneybags version. </p> <p>\"They've given me a brief that their long-term plan is to have homegrown talent rather than to invest year after year,\" said Bath, whose coaches include the former Chelsea players Damian Matthew, Eddie Newton and Jason Cundy. \"With the work that's going on at such younger ages, who knows, in eight, nine, 10 years' time we might find ourselves with seven or eight players in the first team, which is my target and the club's.\" </p> <p>Those younger ages are key. The academy system, which began six years ago, allows Premier and Football League clubs to work with players from the age of seven rather than 12. </p> <p>\"Ajax, who are renowned for their production of players, said their stats have shown that when they took the boys early - at seven, eight and nine - they have produced a better quality of player,\" said Dave Richardson, the Premier League's director of youth. </p> <p>\"We think we have a system ... which will produce a level of player that means our leading clubs don't have to seek so many from further afield.\" </p> <p>Chelsea hope Michael Mancienne, an England Under-17 international, will fulfil his potential. On Thursday Mourinho's eye was drawn to a 12-year-old goalkeeper. \"My goalkeeping coach is ready to work with him now and again to teach him a few things,\" he said. \"And this kid needs a lot of support because he's coming from Bosnia and he lost his father and mother in the war.\" </p> <p>The manager feels his trips to the academy can help the club's search for talent. \"Every kid and parent needs motivation to be in Chelsea,\" he said, \"and it's a big boost for them to try to join us if they feel I'm there, involved and interested.\" A club soon to have the most money and the finest youngsters? Even Ars\u00e8ne Wenger might be tempted to give up.</p>",
  "<p>No sooner had Arsenal first equalled and then broken Nottingham Forest's 26-year-old record of going 42 league matches without defeat than doubts were being expressed about the likelihood of such an achievement ever being repeated. </p> <p>The longer the present run lasts the stronger this feeling will become. Arsenal's next six Premiership matches will see them visit Norwich, Fulham and Manchester City with Bolton, Charlton and Aston Villa coming to Highbury. </p> <p>Defeat in any of these games would be a considerable surprise. So by the time Arsenal face Manchester United at Old Trafford on October 24 they could well be on the brink of an unbeaten half-century. </p> <p>Yet it is hard to believe that another quarter of a century will pass before a team at least approaches Arsenal's new record, always assuming Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team do not remain unbeaten for another 38 matches in which case they would be entitled to consider their record as unbreakable as a steel-plated CD. </p> <p>The polarisation of the Premiership surely makes it more likely that the outstanding team of the day will enjoy long spells without being beaten. At present, and for the foreseeable future, the English national league is about Arsenal, Manchester United and either Chelsea or whichever club happens to catch the eye of a future foreign oligarch. </p> <p>Inevitably comparisons have been made between Arsenal and the Nottingham Forest side that won the old First Division in the 1977-78 season after avoiding defeat in their last 26 matches and then went unbeaten for a further 16 games the following season. It is a harmless yet idle exercise, for so much in football has changed since then. </p> <p>Half of Forest's 42 matches were drawn whereas Arsenal have won 31 of their 43. Then again, it should be remembered that in the late 1970s a win was still worth only two points which made the draw a better option for prospective champions than it is now. </p> <p>It was a commonly held view among managers that a team started a match with a point and if they did not concede a goal then they would still have a point at the end of it. Brian Clough and his assistant, Peter Taylor, rivalled the strictest hospital matron in their belief in the sanctity of clean sheets. </p> <p>To that end no sooner had Forest won promotion from the old Second Division in 1977 than Clough signed Peter Shilton from Stoke to keep goal. Word had it that Shilton was earning \u00a33,000 a week. What was the game coming to? </p> <p>Backed by Shilton, a Forest defence built around the daunting figure of Kenny Burns gave Clough's team the solid foundations essential for success in that era. At that time defenders could tackle from behind and pass back with impunity, and move up for offside confident that a flag would be raised whatever the circumstances. </p> <p>Arsenal's 3-0 victory against Blackburn on Wednesday brought their goals total during this unbeaten Premiership sequence to 95. In dour contrast Forest managed only 58 in 42. </p> <p>While the difference undoubtedly reflects the greater attacking talent available to Wenger it is also the case that, since the offside law was liberalised, teams are defending deeper which means that the play has become stretched, leaving more space for the talents of Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp and the like. </p> <p>Yet when Arsenal's opponents attempt to press up behind the ball in the old manner they are apt to be caught by counter-attacks which for speed, vision, invention and execution are surpassing even the best of Alex Ferguson's Manchester United sides, not to mention a succession of outstanding Liverpool teams. </p> <p>Even so it is hard to believe that even this Arsenal team would have performed with such fluency on the English pitches of the late 1970s, many of which became mudheaps once winter had set in. The City Ground at Nottingham was much inclined to churn up in the rain, when the ability of John Robertson to produce outstanding centres from the relatively firm wings proved invaluable. </p> <p>Arsenal's style depends heavily on the ball running true. Wenger's players would not have taken kindly to the old Highbury pitches which, while they drained better than most, were often bumpy and unpredictable. </p> <p>Clough's Forest were functional, Wenger's Arsenal are infinitely more fun to watch. At the same time the season Forest won the championship was the last in England before the bar on overseas imports was lifted. Clough used only 18 players during Forest's unbeaten run: 12 Englishmen, five Scots and a Northern Irishman, Martin O'Neill. Wenger has employed 31 multinationals.</p> <p>If Arsenal's feat has been more watchable, that of Nottingham Forest was arguably more remarkable considering they had only just won promotion. And the other record Forest set in 1978, undefeated in 40 matches in all competitions, surely remains the more impressive feat. </p> <p>In fact between November 1977 and December 1978 Clough's side lost one match out of 62, an FA Cup quarter-final at West Bromwich. Oh, and they also went on to win and retain a European Cup which, for Arsenal, remains a distant grail.</p>",
  "<p>The last week of the school holidays was the most depressing part of my childhood.

  "<p> The postman was kind yesterday. In amongst the bills and offers of loans was a jiffy bag containing preview code of <a href=\"http://www.pesfan.com/bulletin/index.html\">Pro Evolution Soccer 4</a> for PS2. Pro Evo is the best footy game around, far eclipsing the glossy FIFA series. After 3 hrs solid play it is clear that this is not going to change. PES4 is superb.</p> <p>With every iteration, Pro Evo gets further refined. 4 picks up where 3 left off, especially in the speed of the game which seems faster. Combined with this is even greater control over the players and a real feeling that they are doing what you want them to do rather than the PS2 deciding. A classic example was when playing as Saints - yes, the mighty reds are included, plus most of the other premiership teams. A long ball up to Crouch was flicked on to Phillips. Shaka Hislop was favourite to get it but a swift tap of the x button saw Phillips lunge with the boot and hook it over the keeper. The point is that it felt right, looked realistic and was incredibly satisfying - far more so than the 30yard screamers routinely knocked in when playing FIFA.<br>This was only preview code so hopefully Konami will iron out the niggles, which are mainly presentational. The menu and option screens seem to have finally been edited by someone who speaks English, but they still look amateurish. The licenses are still lacking for English teams - so expect Soton, North East London etc - but this may change before release. Also the on-pitch ref - a first for the series - doesn't seem to add very much.<br>Overall though, PES 4 looks incredibly promising. You'll be able to play if you are going to Game Stars Live, otherwise release is due late October. All Konami have to do now is confirm online play for Xbox Live.</p>",

The Malasa\u00f1a area attracts a younger, grungier crowd. </p> <p><strong> Extra time:</strong> Diehards will want to visit the Exposici\u00f3n de Trofeos at the Bernab\u00e9u (Tue-Sun 10.30am-7.30pm, \u20ac3.50). </p> <p>For local colour, check out the El Rastro flea market around Plaza dos Cascorro on Sunday morning. It sells everything from clothes to antiques to stolen goods - so watch your pockets. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> The kitsch leather and marble lobby - not to mention mirror-filled rooms - at the Monaco (C/de Barbieri, +34 91 522 4630) reflect the fact this was once a high-class brothel. In the heart of the lively Chueca area, this is a fun place to stay. Nearby is the more sedate San Lorenzo (C/de Clavet, +39 91 521 3057, <a href=\"http://hotel-sanlorenzo.com/\">hotel-sanlorenzo.com</a>), with well-equipped rooms and a cafe in its attractive courtyard. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> British Airways (0870 8509850, <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/globalgateway.jsp/global/public/en_\">ba.com</a>), Iberia (0845 6012854, <a href=\"http://www.iberia.com/\">iberia.com</a>) and EasyJet (0871 75001001, <a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com/\">easyjet.com</a>). <br> <strong> Valencia</strong></p> <p> The Spanish and Uefa Cup champions, <strong> Valencia</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.valenciacf.es/\">valenciacf.es</a>) are one of the most stylish and exciting teams in Europe. Throw in the beach, plenty of sunshine and some of the best nightlife in Spain and this is the ideal city for a weekend break. </p> <p><strong> Team Talk: </strong> No Galacticos here, but Roberto Ayala and Pablo Aimar, plus Vicente and Mista are every bit as good. New manager Claudio Ranieri has strength-ened the squad with Bernado Corradi and Marco Di Vaio. </p> <p><strong> The big match:</strong> Games against glamour boys <strong> Barcelona</strong> (May 8 2005) and <strong> Real Madrid</strong> (Mar 6 2005) are the ones to go for, but the most eagerly awaited match is the local derby against <strong> Levante</strong> (Jan 9 2005), the first time the city's second team has been in the top flight for 40 years. Valencia v <strong> Deportivo La Coruna </strong> (Feb 13 2005) is a meeting of two smaller clubs playing fluid, exciting football. </p> <p><strong> Just the ticket:</strong> \u20ac20-\u20ac100, sold at <a href=\"http://ww3.serviticket.com/jsp/cachejsp.jsp?control=serviticket.sis.servlets.hsrvinicinws&amp;idioma=cas&amp;codiusu=servicaixa\">servicaixa.com</a>(in Spanish) and the ticket office at the Campo de Mestalla stadium (+34 96 360 17 26) on Avenida Suecia two or three days before the match. The club shop is on C/Pintor Sorolla, 25 (+34 96 351 47 42). </p> <p><strong> Swift one:</strong> The Museo Deportivo de Manolo el del Bombo (Plaza Valencia CF, near the stadium, manoloel delbombo.com) is a bar-cum-shrine to the club's most famous fan, the rotund drummer cameramen zoom in on at every World Cup.</p> <p>The hip Barrio del Carmen neighbourhood in the old city is full of bars, clubs and restaurants fighting for space in the narrow streets. </p> <p><strong> Extra time:</strong> The futuristic City of Arts and Sciences appears to rise out of the blue pool that surrounds it. Some of the exhibits are as stunning as the architecture (+39 902 100 031, cac.es, \u20ac8-\u20ac22 depending on which bits you want to see). </p> <p>The long sandy beach north of town, backed by bars and some good seafood restaurants, is where Valencians go to play. The water is a little murky but fine for swimming. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> Consul del Mar (+34 963 625 432, <a href=\"http://www.hotelconsuldelmar.com/\">hotelconsuldelmar.com</a>) is a Modernista hotel near the beach. Rates are halved at weekends (doubles \u20ac72.90), so it's a real bargain.</p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> British Airways and Iberia. </p> <p><strong> Porto</strong></p> <p> The home of the European champions is now as famous for its football as it is its fortified wine. The \"Drag\u00f5es\" (fcporto.pt) have slayed plenty of big names on their way to winning the Uefa Cup and Champions League in successive seasons. And the old town, Cais da Ribeira, with its cobbled streets and steep alleyways, has a timeless air. </p> <p><strong> Team Talk:</strong> New signings include Brazilian wunderkind Diego and Postiga, breaker of English hearts at Euro 2004.</p> <p><strong> The big match:</strong> Porto v <strong> Benfica</strong> is the crunch match. They meet for the first time in Porto's new Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o, built for Euro 2004, on Feb 27 2005. Porto v <strong> Sporting</strong> (Nov 7) is also worth catching. The stadium is a half-hour walk from town, or take a bus or (cheap) taxi.</p> <p><strong> Just the ticket:</strong> \u20ac5-\u20ac40, on sale 7-10 days before the game from the ground, the four club shops in town, the club's site or telephone hotline (+351 22 508 3700). <strong> Swift one:</strong> The old town is full of bars and clubs - a good place to head, both pre- and post-match.</p> <p><strong> Extra time:</strong> The famous port wine cellars (Taylors Sandemans, Crofts, Grahams) are in Vila Nova de Gaia on the north bank of the river. Tasting tours of the lodges are free or for a nominal fee.</p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> Pens\u00e3o de Paris, Rua da F\u00e1brica 27-29 (+351 222 073 140, doubles \u20ac45 B&amp;B) is a popular old place with huge rooms. The Grande Hotel do Porto, Rua de Santa Catarina 197 (+351 222 076 690, <a href=\"http://www.grandehotelporto.com\">grandehotelporto.com</a>) is very good value at \u20ac80 for a double with breakfast.</p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> BA and TAP Air Portugal (0845 6010932, <a href=\"http://www.tap-airportugal.pt\">tap-airportugal.pt</a>).</p> <p><strong> Milan </strong></p> <p>Perhaps the first city of European football, with two of its most successful clubs, <strong> AC Milan</strong> (acmilan.com) and <strong> Internazionale</strong> (inter.it), and one of its greatest stadiums, the San Siro, home to both clubs. </p> <p><strong> Team Talk: </strong> AC boast Cafu, Rui Costa, Serginho, Andrei Shevchenko, Kaka, Alessandro Nesta and the legendary Paolo Maldini. Inter have just signed Edgar Davids and Juan Sebastian Veron in an attempt to keep up. </p> <p><strong> The big match:</strong> With both clubs effectively playing at home the <strong> AC v Inter</strong> local derbies (Oct 24 and Feb 27 2005) are electrifying, especially as the stands rise up from the pitchside - rare in a stadium as grand as this. Inter's hardcore element base themselves in the curva nord, Milan's in the curva sud. The Inter v <strong> Juventus</strong> (Nov 28) Derby d'Italia also lives up to its billing, but Milan v <strong> Juve</strong> (May 8 2005) is a bigger match. The visit of the two Rome clubs, <strong> Lazio</strong> and <strong> Roma</strong>, are also eagerly awaited (Inter v Lazio Oct 31; AC v Lazio Feb 6 2005; AC v Roma Nov 7; Inter v Roma Feb 13 2005). </p> <p>To get to the ground, leave the metro at Lotto and jump on the free orange bus. </p> <p><strong> Just the ticket:</strong> From \u20ac18; best views are from the east side for \u20ac70 or the west for \u20ac135. Tickets can be bought from club websites or <a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.it/index.php\">ticketweb.it</a> (in Italian), which can send the tickets via UPS - or pick them up from its office on via Cappuccini 11. Tickets can also be bought locally from authorised news vendors and cafes, but for big games it is essential to pre-book. </p> <p><strong> Swift one:</strong> La Motta on the Piazza del Duomo is the place for people watching, espresso and panini. The best areas for nightlife are the navigli (canals) southwest of the city centre and the Brera district near La Scala. </p> <p><strong> Extra time:</strong> The Duomo (cathedral) is Milan's most famous landmark and offers views of the city and the Alps. The designer shops along Montenapoleone and Via Spigo are cathedrals to another kind of religion. Prices for Italian labels are cheaper than the UK. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> Antica Locanda Solferino, Via Castelfidardo 2, (+39 2 6570129 <a href=\"http://www.anticalocandasolferino.it/\">anticalocandasolferino.it</a>, doubles from \u20ac100) is a charming 19th-century inn in the heart of Brera. Book well ahead. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> British Airways, Ryanair (0871 246 0000, <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/\">ryanair.com</a>), BMI (0870 607 0555, <a href=\"http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/en/index.aspx\">bmibaby.com</a>), Alitalia (070 544 8259, <a href=\"http://www.alitalia.com/\">alitalia.com</a>) and EasyJet. </p> <p><strong> Rome</strong></p> <p> <strong> Lazio</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.sslazio.it/\">sslazio.it</a>) and <strong> Roma</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.asromacalcio.it/\">asromacalcio.it</a>) are less glamourous than the Milanese teams, but the rivalry between the two is fiercer, the local derbies headier. </p> <p><strong> Team Talk: </strong> Like Milan, Rome is a two-club, one-stadium city, the two clubs sharing the Stadio Olimpico. Roma are led by the talismanic Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Montella. Cash-strapped Lazio have re-signed Paolo di Canio in the hope he will conjure up some magic for one last season. </p> <p><strong> The big match:</strong> Il Derby della Capitale is the rowdiest in Italy (Jan 6 and May 5 2005). With the laziali at the curva nord and romanisti at the curva sud, the fun starts with the coreografia, the impressive displays of co-ordinated card holding that fill each end of the ground. These games are also worth catching: Lazio play <strong> Milan</strong> (Sep 29), <strong> Inter</strong> (Mar 13 2005) and <strong> Juve</strong> (April 24 2005); Roma play <strong> Inter </strong> (Oct 3), <strong> Juve </strong> (March 6 2005) and <strong> Milan </strong> (March 20 2005). </p> <p>To get to the ground take metro Line A to Ottaviano - S. Pietro, then jump on the 32 bus with everyone else. </p> <p><strong> Just the ticket:</strong> From \u20ac16 behind the goals with the hardcore (not a great view) up to around \u20ac120. The tevere lateral for around \u20ac70 is a good option. You can buy tickets on the day at the stadium, in town at lotto kiosks, Orbis in Piazza Esquilino 37, (+39 06 482 7403) or the club stores: Roma's is at Piazza Colonna 360 (+39 06 68 651), Lazio's at Via Farini 34 (+39 06 482 6768). </p> <p><strong> Swift one:</strong> Bar San Calisto (Piazza San Calisto) with old pictures of both teams on the wall, is good for a cheap beer on the terrace. It's in lively Trastevere, where Romans go to play at night. <br><strong> Extra time:</strong> There's so much to see in Rome you might forget about the footie. If you only have time to visit one attraction go and marvel at the Colosseum (\u20ac8, or \u20ac16 if you join a group with a guide to skip the queue). </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> Mid-range hotels are difficult to find, so book early. The refurbished Residenza Cellini near the Trevi Fountain, Via Modena 5, (+39 06 47825204, <a href=\"http://www.residenzacellini.it/\">residenzacellini.it</a>) has doubles from \u20ac145. Fawlty Towers, via Magenta 39, (+39 06 445 0374, <a href=\"http://www.fawltytowers.org/\">fawltytowers.org</a>, \u20ac18-\u20ac23 dorms, rooms from \u20ac44) is a famous cheapie near Termini, where many budget hotels can be found. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> BA, Alitalia, EasyJet and Ryanair. </p> <p><strong> Before you go: </strong> When booking your flight bear in mind that Sunday afternoon fixtures in Spain, Italy and Portugal can be moved to the Saturday or Sunday night at short notice at the whim of TV schedulers. <a href=\"http://www.Soccer-Spain.com\">Soccer-Spain.com</a> and the Football Italia section of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com\">channel4.com</a> are good for the latest team and ticket news. </p> <p><strong> Getting in:</strong> Attendances fluctuate much more than in the UK, so for all but the biggest games you will be able to buy a ticket the day before the match or on the day itself. For important matches, however, there are only two ways of getting a ticket: from a tout or through a travel agent. As in the UK, touting is illegal but common. If you do opt for this method, try to buy from a socio, or member, selling a spare seat. </p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Always check where in the stadium your seat is before buying from a UK agent. ATP Sports Events (0870 9906787, <a href=\"http://www.atpsportsevents.com\">atpsportsevents.com</a>) offer packages ranging from \u00a3149pp for match tickets plus two nights' accommodation (no flights) to Lisbon or Porto, through to \u00a3520-\u00a3549pp for Barcelona v Real Madrid with flights, two nights' hotel accommodation and match tickets. Packages for the Milan derbies are \u00a3399, including flights. The Sporting Traveller (01737 244398, <a href=\"http://www.thesportingtraveller.com\">thesportingtraveller.com</a>) offers two nights' B&amp;B in a three-star hotel plus match tickets (but no flights) for Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Rome from \u00a3179, rising to \u00a3600-plus for good seats at Real Madrid v Barcelona.

Liaisons Abroad (020-7376 4020, <a href=\"http://www.liaisonsabroad.com\">.liaisonsabroad.com</a>) arranges tickets and deliver them to your hotel for games in Spain or Italy for \u00a370-\u00a3125. </p> <p><strong> Other football cities:</strong> For the Total Football experience, and a healthy interlude to a weekend in Amsterdam, go and see <strong> Ajax </strong> (<a href=\"http://www.ajax.nl\">ajax.nl</a>). <strong> Barcelona's </strong> ( &lt;a href=\"http://www.fcbarcelona.com) Nou Camp is the biggest stadium and for many offers the best atmosphere in Europe. They entertain Real Madrid on Nov 21. The French are less fanatical about le foot than their southern neighbours - except in Marseille where <strong> Olympique </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.olympiquedemarseille.com\">olympiquedemarseille.com</a>) is part of the lifeblood of the city. Despite Porto's recent dominance, <strong> Benfica </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.slbenfica.pt\">slbenfica.pt</a>) are still the biggest club in Portugal and their famous Stadium of Light, rebuilt for Euro 2004, is awesome. Further afield, the local derbies between <strong> Olympiakos </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.olympiakos.gr\">olympiakos.gr</a>) and <strong> Panathinaikos </strong> (<a href=\"http://www.pao.gr\">pao.gr</a>) in Athens, and <strong> Galatasaray </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.galatasaray.net\">galatasaray.net</a>) and <strong> Fenerbache </strong> (<a href=\"http://www.fenerbache.org\">fenerbache.org</a>) in Istanbul are exhilarating, often wild occasions.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Grumpy Old Men: A Manual for the British Malcontent</strong> <br>by David Quantick <br>143pp, HarperCollins, \u00a39.99 </p> <p><strong> All Oiks Now: The Unnoticed Surrender of Middle England</strong><br> by Digby Anderson <br>95pp, Social Affairs Unit, \u00a39.95 </p> <p><strong> Mr Wonderful Takes a Cruise: The Adventures of an Old-Age Pensioner</strong> <br>by John Nott <br>218pp, Ebury Press, \u00a39.99</p> <p>I am, in one respect, an ideal person to review this collection of moans by ageing males. I fit perfectly the demographic group cited by David Quantick as the grumpiest in Britain - men aged between 35 and 54. I'm well into the second half of that grumpy age range and getting more peevish by the day. But there is a problem: I didn't see the highly successful BBC2 series that \"inspired\" Quantick's moaners' manifesto and have no idea what connection there is between programme and book. I would guess none; this looks like a shameless piece of bandwagon-chasing. </p> <p>I didn't see the TV series because I don't watch television, except the news headlines at 10pm on BBC1 (the remainder of the bulletin, with its nodding-dog correspondents, is too painful), Test cricket on Channel 4 (thankfully the one-day rubbish is confined to Sky) and occasional late-night porn on Channel 5. The rest of my time I spend listening to Schumann. </p> <p>I was well disposed towards Quantick's book until I read the flyleaf. Quantick, who appears principally to be a comedy writer, is also described as an \"active journalist\". What on earth is that? Can journalists, other perhaps than leader writers, be inactive? Worse, Kazakhstan is spelt \"Khazakstan\". The book is badly organised, written with a sort of comic desperation, and printed on appalling paper which ensures that the photographs (in any case superfluous) are virtually blacked out. </p> <p>Quantick does score some hits, though it was not until page 31 that I found myself nodding vigorously in agreement, when he rounds on hotels that put notices in the bathroom suggesting that you use the same towels throughout your stay \"for the sake of the environment\". He suggests putting up a counter-notice: \"I am the environment and I am sick of being blamed for the fact that you can't be bothered to wash your towels every day.\" (He actually writes \"you bastards can't be bothered\", which weakens the comic effect, but everything here is overegged.) </p> <p>The towels notice is a good target because it is unexpected. His dismissal of \"the theatre\" - cramped, rip-off programmes and everyone knows how King Lear ends anyway - also strikes a chord. Elsewhere, there are too many of the usual suspects: theme pubs, burger bars, speed humps, call centres, muzak. You don't have to be a grumpy old man to be irritated by these; just vaguely human. </p> <p>Some of Quantick's targets are ludicruous. Supermarkets, which he calls \"giant stadiums of consumer hell\", are a delight, especially the new automated checkouts which save having to deal with any people at all. He attacks drivers of black cabs, but in my experience they are clever, honest and almost universally helpful, and they never \"talk bollocks\" (as he claims) these days because they have an earpiece stuck in their ear and are discussing loft conversions with their mate in Romford. Quantick also professes to dislike traffic wardens, yet these fine, upstanding citizens walk around in wretched weather for eight hours a day in an effort to keep our streets congestion free (and, even more importantly, allow me to park outside my own house in our parking-controlled street). Some mornings I feel like hugging the traffic warden. </p> <p>I distrust Quantick's range of b\u00eates noires. No one really hates mime artists, clowns, astrologers, 30-year-old pizza delivery \"boys\", estate agents or the royals. They may be ludicrous, but they're not loathsome. Their sins are far more excusable than, say, not being able to spell Kazakhstan. This is a list that a group of editors would produce who wanted to cash in on the success of a television series. I noticed it is doing well in the bestsellers' list, so the ruse appears to have worked. </p> <p>Digby Anderson's All Oiks Now is not really a book at all; it's an extended pamphlet-cum-provocation issued by the Social Affairs Unit (a rightwing pressure group) to mark him stepping down as director after 24 years. At one level, it is deeply offensive, endlessly banging on about the \"lower orders\" and how the middle classes (Anderson's beloved Middle England) have accepted their value systems - poor pronunciation, sloppy dress, not eating at table, failing to control their children, falling into debt. It is nonsense, but at least it's heartfelt nonsense. It wasn't inspired by a TV series; the grumpiness is for real. </p> <p>Anderson was evidently brought up in the 1950s: grey, deferential, children seen but not heard, laconic barbers cutting your hair for one and six, men in hats applauding politely at cricket matches. He is profoundly irritated by 21st-century Britain: middle-aged women pretending to be teenagers, unruly children, \"stylists\" who charge you \u00a320 for a haircut, cricket matches ruined by Mexican waves and Yorkshiremen dressed as nuns. Ignore the class bias - the working class loathe all this stuff too - and many of his gripes about our sloppy, infantilised, credit-dependent, celebrity-obsessed culture (sic) are legitimate, though he does himself no favours by wondering whether a war (\"a long and horrific one\") might be the solution. All very 30s and a high price to pay to stop morons emblazoning FCUK across their chests. </p> <p>Anderson tries (and fails) to be systematic. John Nott, who is of an even older vintage and a former Conservative minister (you may remember his contretemps with Robin Day), shares many of the same prejudices, but still manages to produce quite a jolly survey of contemporary Britain. The premise is that Nott, released from the City at 70, is a latterday Rip van Winkle who sets out to rediscover his homeland. The opening is promising: \"I was born before the invention of the pill, television, dishwashers, disposable nappies and New Labour. In those days, a 'chip' was a fried potato. We had 'crumpets' for tea. 'Grass' was mown. 'Coke' was something you put on the fire. A 'joint' was a piece of meat that you ate for Sunday lunch and 'gay' people were the life and soul of the party, not members of the Cabinet.\" </p> <p>The work, which is wildly discursive, never quite lives up to that overture, but there are some diverting episodes - visits to a Spearmint Rhino club (enjoyable), the nightclub Chinawhite (awful), a Buckingham Palace garden party (splendid). Nott, who hates spending money, gives an amusing description of his attempt to smuggle his own wine into dinner on a cruise ship. He also thinks about sex a great deal and likes to chat up young women on buses. It is behaviour pleasingly unbecoming to a privy councillor and former secretary of state for defence. </p> <p>His views are those you might expect of a septuagenarian Tory who has spent most of his life in the City. A dash of homophobia; suspiciously frequent references to the number of black faces seen and foreign languages heard in London; a dislike of fat working-class women in tight-fitting tops, the internet, health clubs, happy-clappy priests, the Guardian, estuary English, NHS bureaucracy. But he has such fun chatting up lapdancers, looking at vibrators in Ann Summers shops, learning the foxtrot (in preparation for his cruise to Norway) and riding on the number 19 bus that all his moans have to be taken with a large pinch of salt, and his ultimate refusal to condemn comes as no surprise. \"The elderly must not become old Grundys, deploring the modern world, saying that the country is not what it was. It never has been.\" </p> <p>Nott has passed through menopausal middle age, with its unremitting, soul-destroying grumpiness, and is growing old disgracefully, laughing at the world's absurdities with a Falstaffian grandeur and detachment. There may yet be hope for Digby and me.</p>",
  "<p>Hewlett-Packard duly unveiled a raft of new products yesterday, including a Digital Entertainment Center and an Instant Cinema Digital Projector.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/08/27/HNipod_1.html\">IDG News Service</a>: \"The Digital Entertainment Center is designed to be a hub for managing digital content such as music, movies and photos from a single device located in the living room. The four-inch tall device, scheduled to ship in the fourth quarter, contains a personal video recorder, a digital video recorder and a DVD, and is managed with a remote control. 'It is a couch potato's dream,' Fiorina quipped. No pricing information was given for this product.</p> <p>\"Fiorina also introduced the HP Instant Cinema Digital Projector ep9010, which combines a projector, DVD player and a stereo/subwoofer sound system, which she described as 'a boombox for movies'. Estimated retail price for this product is $1,999. It will ship in the third quarter.\"</p> <p>While these and other products might be interesting, they were overshadowed by the long-awaited unveiling of HP's version of Apple's iPod. IDG reports that this \"will begin shipping in early September in two versions: a 20G-byte version costing $299 and a 40G-byte version costing $399. The Apple iPod from HP will be available at major consumer electronic retailers and at www.hpshopping.com, Fiorina said.\"</p> <p>Further, next month, \"HP will launch what it calls iPod 'tattoos' for users to dress up their iPods. The self-sticking paper will be preconfigured to fit the iPod, allowing users to print either premade designs or self-made designs, she said. 'One thing we know about today's consumers is they want to connect emotionally to their products,' [Fiorina] said. The so-called HP Printable Tattoos will be easy to apply and remove and be water-resistant, she said.\"</p>",
  "<p>In their familiar modern form, comic strips were introduced to lighten the content of newspapers. They were sometimes called the \"funnies\" or, in the case of the Scottish Sunday Post, which was bred in the same stable as the Beano and the Dandy, \"The Fun Section\". Art Spiegelman is among the best-known living cartoonists, but the drawings that have made him famous are not funny, and they are not intended solely for children. Spiegelman and other comic-book artists of the underground renaissance that occurred during the 1960s are inclined to call their work \"comix\" - the final letter, perhaps subliminally, endorsing them for consumption by grown-ups. His most famous creation, Maus, in which the Jews are depicted as mice, tracks the experience of his parents in Poland before and during the second world war, leading eventually to Auschwitz, or \"Mauschwitz\". The book was published in two volumes in 1986 and 1991. </p> <p>The new Spiegelman production, In the Shadow of No Towers, suggests parallels between the horror suffered by the elder Spiegelmans and that of their son on September 11 2001, and over the days and months that followed. \"Maybe I really want the world to end, to vindicate the fears I felt back on 9/11!\" says the Spiegelman figure in one of the No Towers strips, dated almost two years after the event. \"Maybe it's just my little world that ended.\" </p> <p>In person, Spiegelman does not give the least impression that his world has ended, or is about to. His express-train conversation manages to convey wit, paranoia, an obsession with American politics and a caustic intelligence, all in a single sentence. With his wife and their two chil dren, Spiegelman is about to embark on a three-week holiday in a gite in Provence. \"I'd move to France,\" he says. \"I'm just not sure if it's worse to be a victim of Bush's foreign policy than of his domestic policy.\" The sardonic one-liners roll from his tongue as regularly as the cigarettes from the pack on the table before him. He smokes so much \"that I might not live to see the end of the world\". An unrealistically sickly looking Spiegelman peers from a panel in the new book, gasping: \"Cof!\" </p> <p>The strips in No Towers were begun while Spiegelman was working at the New Yorker. However, they were declined by the magazine and by other leading American papers, eventually being published in New York's weekly Jewish newspaper, the Forward, which had serialised Maus. Steve Bell, the Guardian's political cartoonist, is not surprised that Spiegelman had difficulty in getting the new work published in the United States. \"It was the climate after 9/11. I've spoken to a lot of cartoonists who had a hard time getting stuff accepted. Self-censorship then comes into play, because you just know they won't publish it. American papers are very careful not to offend - which is silly really, because while you're being careful not to offend, the government is off doing very offensive stuff.\" </p> <p>Spiegelman describes his acceptance in the relatively humble pages of the Forward as being granted \"the right of return\". He felt obliged to point out to the editor that, unlike Maus, his new work would have little Jewish content. \"He shrugged and said: 'It's okay - you're Jewish'.\" The strips were published, more or less simultaneously, in Die Zeit in Germany and in the London Review of Books in Britain. Spiegelman resigned as consulting editor of the New Yorker at the end of 2002.</p> <p> In the Shadow of No Towers consists of 10 broadsheet plates by Spiegelman and a further seven plates, what he calls \"the second Tower\", taken from the funnies printed during the early years of last century in newspapers such as the New York American, the World, and the Chicago Tribune. The latter comics all in some way reflect the themes of Spiegelman's own drawings in the \"first Tower\". One, dated 1902, shows \"Foxy Grandpa\" reading the Declaration of Independence on the fourth of July and being interrupted by an explosion, while another depicts the Happy Hooligan, a popular idiot, assuming the guise of \"Abdullah, the Arab Chief\" and coming to grief with a 1,000lb weight dropped on his head. In a 1921 cartoon from the New York American, a character visits Pisa and, like Spiegelman after September 11, is kept awake by thoughts of the famous tower falling on him. However, the most spectacular of the book's borrowings is in the endpapers, which reproduces the September 11 1901 front page of the New York World with the headline \"President's Wound Reopened: Slight Change for the Worse\". The story referred to the shooting by anarchists of President William McKinley (he died three days later). The overall effect of Spiegelman's new work is of a synthetic collage, in which the various parts interact in the reader's mind to compose changing wholes. </p> <p>Edward Koren, a cartoonist who has been associated with the New Yorker for more than 40 years, feels that Spiegelman \"has an extraordinary sense of the history of the evolution of the comic strip. It's quite bold of him to put his work next to that of the masters.\" </p> <p>The original schedule for publication in the Forward was one broadsheet plate per month, but when Spiegelman began work he found that the destruction of the World Trade Center, which he witnessed and which happened close to his daughter's school, had put him into shock and slow motion. Plate 2, for example, took almost three months to complete. \"How did the old timers do it?\" he asks, in awe at the rapid production of the beautifully executed New York World and Chicago Tribune strips, featuring the likes of Little Nemo and the Katzenjammer Kids. \"I can't imagine. They had to turn out a full-page spread every Sunday, plus lots of work for the dailies. But here, I couldn't always meet my deadlines. And I had a certain kind of urgency. I really thought another attack was going to happen in New York any second.\" </p> <p>Small and neat and wearing a black waistcoat like \"Artie\" in Maus, he seems every inch the smart New Yorker, although he was born in Stockholm, spent his American infancy in Pennsylvania, and moved to California for six years in the 1970s \"after a short stay in a mental hospital\". The power of Maus derives not just from the atrocious experience of the parents - the betrayal into Nazi hands by smugglers who had promised to save them, the poisoning of their elder son Richieu by a guardian to spare him from the gas chambers, the unspeakable ordeal of the camps - but from the book's sub-plot, which delineates the difficult relationship between father and son. Vladek Spiegelman is portrayed as selfish and petty. The resources that enabled him to survive Auschwitz have hardened into extreme parsimony. While virtually every other family member perished, Vladek and his wife survived. Then, in 1968, Anja committed suicide. Art was living at home at the time, having been released from a state hospital three months earlier. The suicide is commemorated with shrieking intensity in a four-page strip, \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" (1973), which evokes the artist's imbalanced mind as he speaks from his mental prison: \"Well, Mom, if you're listening... Congratulations! ... You've committed the perfect crime... You put me here... shorted all my circuits... You murdered me, Mommy, and you left me here to take the rap!!!\" Vladek died of heart failure in 1982, four years before the publication of Maus I. </p> <p>Michael Greenberg, a New Yorker who used to work for the Forward and now writes a fortnightly column in the TLS, says that \"a lot of the impact of the Maus books came from the fact that Spiegelman didn't sentimentalise the survivor. Like Isaac Bashevis Singer, he showed how destroyed and desperate their post-Holocaust lives could be. There was this sacred, hushed, horrified feeling among Jews towards Holocaust survivors when I was growing up. We were supposed to revere them - they were martyrs of anti-semitism - but in reality they were often ruined, angry, depressed, impatient people whom you could never figure out.\" The children of survivors, Greenberg adds, \"often had a mordancy that the rest of us didn't have. They had this special knowledge about suffering. And they seemed to resent it. In some cases, there was a need to do something extreme in response to it all. I sense something of that quality in Spiegelman.\" </p> <p>Bryan Cheyette, the author of Modernity, Culture and \"the Jew\" (1998), adds: \"What does this word 'survivor' mean? What has Vladek survived? He's picking up wire in the street and leaving the gas running all the time to save on matches. At some level, he hasn't survived at all.\" Cheyette teaches a course in Holocaust literature at Southampton University. \" Maus has always been a part of the course. I brought it in straight away when the first volume came out in 1986. It very quickly became a canonical text.\" Students are often \"shocked and surprised\" at being asked to read a comic book, he says, \"but they soon come round to seeing the complexity of the work. Maus operates on different levels. For example, it introduces the idea of the 'second generation', that the Holocaust isn't something that's buried in the past but that it flows through the generations.\" </p> <p>The use of the first-person narrator in comics is a method Spiegelman popularised, though he credits its development to a fellow cartoonist, Justin Green. \"I'm surprised it didn't take off earlier,\" says Spiegelman, \"because comics have that quality of personal storytelling. In a sense it's like an overly developed handwriting. So it seems a natural thing to start using the word 'I' and continue from there.\" He has been drawing since an early age. At 15, he started working for his local paper in Rego Park, New York, \"and getting paid for it, so I became a sort of pro. But I really found my own voice as a cartoonist beginning in about 1971, and the first important piece of work was the three-page version of Maus, which appeared in an anthology called Funny Animals . At that point, autobiographical stories became part of the mix for me.\" </p> <p>Spiegelman went to Harpur College (now the State University of New York at Binghampton) to study art. \"They told me I would have to take a philosophy foundation course, so then I decided to become a philosophy major to try to figure out why they wouldn't let me be an art major. And shortly thereafter I dropped out of school altogether.\" (His old university later granted him an honorary doctorate.) In 1968, after \"taking LSD as casually as some of my contemporaries now drop antacids\", he \"snapped\" and was stretchered into a padded cell. For many years afterwards, Spiegelman worked for the Topps gum company, designing novelty cards and sweet packets, including products familiar to Americans such as Garbage Candy and Wacky Packages. </p> <p>Spiegelman's drawings are evocative, but they are seldom elaborate. They lack the frenzied inventiveness of some of his contemporaries in the underground comics movement, such as Crumb, inventor of Mr Natural, Honeybunch Kaminski (\"Jailbait of the Month\") and scores of other energetic creations. He describes his \"signature way of drawing\" as \"really a result of my deficiencies\". It is partly modesty, but Spiegelman suffers from ambylopia, or lazy eye, \"which means that I don't have binocular vision, and have difficulty seeing in three dimensions. This might have been part of what made me a cartoonist rather than a baseball player. I was rotten at sports, but I found that if I could draw good caricatures of the teachers I wouldn't be doomed to be the butt of everybody's scorn.\" The condition might help to explain the thickset nature of many Spiegelman figures, and their broad-stroked execution. </p> <p>According to Bell, \"Art's drawing always impressed me because it was so simple, but I realised it takes a huge amount of work to achieve that simplicity. Some people think it's crude, but Art has developed a style and he can make it do exactly what he wants it to do.\" Some of Spiegelman's pages are bound together with visual motifs that are not always perceptible on first viewing. One example, which he demonstrates with a copy of Maus II open before him, occurs early on in the book. It has a large panel of the artist perched at his desk on top of a pile of emaciated bodies, reflecting on the success of the earlier instalment: \"At least 15 foreign editions are coming out. I've gotten at least four serious offers to turn the book into a movie.\" The artist's pride is undermined by a barely visible swastika which, as he points out, \"is holding the page together\". To Cheyette, this element of Maus 's storyline suggests that Spiegelman is \"very aware of the commodification of the Holocaust\".</p> <p>Spiegelman claims that each speech balloon in Maus was rewritten about 40 times \"in order to condense it\", and he is apt to discuss his work in the manner of a writer. \"It's certainly true that I don't draw as my first response. I don't reach for my pen to doodle. To express myself visually, it's a lot of work, because I don't have the feeling in the wrist of total confidence that lets you move forward. It's easier for me to write than to draw, I suppose. Comics are an art of compression. You allow your thoughts to decant, until they achieve their maximum density.\" An obvious point of comparison for Maus, in which the Nazis are cats, the Poles pigs and the Americans rather genial dogs, is George Orwell's Animal Farm. A critic in the New Republic compared Spiegelman to \"the young Philip Roth\" in his ability \"to make the Jewish speech of several generations sound fresh and unusually convincing\". In 1994, he again took a literary theme when he produced an edition of Joseph Moncure March's epic poem of the prohibition era, The Wild Party, with 100 illustrations. Bell says: \"One of the reasons I'm such an admirer of Maus is because it's a great piece of writing. 'Graphic novel' is too paltry a term. But I still want to think of him as a cartoonist.\" </p> <p>Not everyone falls under Spiegelman's spell. In a profile in the Village Voice published in 1999, Ted Rall, a cartoonist and graphic novelist, attacked Spiegelman as New York's \"undisputed cartoon tsar\". The Pulitzer prize-winning author, Rall wrote, \"is The Man: He's managed to triangulate seemingly disparate circles of Manhattan's media elite to gain the power to define cartooning in this town. If you're a cartoonist, he can make or break your sorry ass.\" Rall also wondered whether he was essentially \"a guy with one great book in him\". </p> <p>Spiegelman's methods have done much to bring comics to the attention of an audience that would not normally read them. As he sees it, he is only helping to restore the status of comics to what it was in the 1930s and 40s, when they \"tended to appeal to an older audience of GIs and other adults\". In 1954, an influential American psychiatrist, Dr Frederic Wertham, published a book called Seduction of the Innocent, in which he claimed comics were a major cause of juvenile delinquency. Out of this came the Comics Code Authority, supposedly self-regulating but in effect a form of suppression, since distributors and retail outlets would not handle comics suspected of breaching the code. The result was the domination of the genre by what Spiegelman calls \"lobotomised super heroes\", frequently engaged in extreme violence while defending America from enemies such as \"the followers of Mahomet\" (Arak, Son of Thunder, 1982) and other exotics. According to Spiegelman, the code practically killed off the \"great tradition\" of comics, just as the persecution of Hollywood actors and directors by Senator Joseph McCarthy in the same decade wounded the film industry. \"There were some very exciting things happening at that time, and some great artists,\" he says, citing Jack Cole, the inventor of Plastic Man in the 40s and early 50s. Spiegelman has compiled a book of Cole's comics, with an introductory essay. He is enthusiastic about the period between the first Superman comic in 1939 and the establishment of the Comics Code Authority in 1954, which he refers to as the golden age. \"Comics that were very popular during the Korean war were Frontline Combat and Two-Fisted Tales, edited by Harvey Kurtzman, the same guy that did MAD. Those can only be described as, at the very least, humanistic comics - or as anti-war war comics.\" In the 40s, Cole was producing hard-boiled pulp fiction comic strips, such as \"Murder, Morphine and Me\", about a crowd of Los Angeles junkies and hustlers. \"The industry was essentially stopped dead in its tracks. It had to rise from its own ashes and it didn't do so until the underground comics movement of the 60s, led by Crumb, Gilbert Shelton of The Furry Freak Brothers, and so on.\" </p> <p>The spectre of censorship hovered over Spiegelman's life at the New Yorker. In an interview printed in Corriera della Sera in February 2003, he was quoted as saying that \"the censorship of my work began as soon as I set foot in the magazine, long before September 11\". Spiegelman claims not to remember having spoken those exact words, but he acknowledges that \"the compromise and self-censorship necessary to play well with others settled in the minute I started working there\". Next year he will publish a visual memoir of his 10 years at the New Yorker, \"with all the different covers and images I did. It's basically a history of the wrestling matches, of what it means to try to graft an underground cartoonist's sensibility on to the DNA of the New Yorker. God bless 'em, they tried. And God bless me, I tried. I guess I got spoiled at an early age. I got used to publishing myself without editorial interference.\" </p> <p>He was brought on to the staff of the New Yorker by Tina Brown, and raised hackles immediately. In 1993 he caused a furore with a cover drawing which showed an African-American woman locked in a kiss with a Hasidic Jew. \"People were shocked and upset by it,\" says Greenberg. \"It was the St Valentine's day issue and Spiegelman was making his statement about the Crown Heights riots and all the depressing shrillness that these powerless groups unleash on one another. I think of him as the political Crumb.\" Koren recalls that, among certain other artists at the magazine, \"there was general lamentation and tearing of hair at that cover. You could look on it as very courageous. You could look at it and say, so what? What are we talking about? The complexity of race relations?\"</p> <p>Spiegelman says he would have been glad to have his No Towers work published in the New Yorker, \"had the New Yorker been glad to have it. But I don't think my tone was appropriate. It was so obvious it wasn't going to be comfortable there. The New Yorker sees everything through a certain script, and it has a certain tone to it, but that tone wasn't the one I was striking with my shrill, sky-is-falling voice, cracking at every moment. I say this with no rancour towards the New Yorker - it's a wonderful magazine and if I take the right meds I might go back.\" When the war in Iraq began last year and the editor of the New Yorker, David Remnick, published \"a reluctant hawk's endorsement\" of the invasion, \"I told him: 'Gee, I'm sorry it was reported that I left in protest, and I'm sorry I left when I did, because I could have left in protest now'.\" </p> <p>Spiegelman's wife, Fran\u00e7oise Mouly, who is French, joined the New Yorker at the same time as he did and continues to be the editor in charge of cover art. \"Because of that Bill-and-Hillary-Clintonish perception of us, there were difficulties from the beginning.\" Spiegelman and Mouly have published and edited various cartoon magazines, the best known of which is Raw. When they started Raw, in 1980, he had been drawing for publications such as Playboy and the New York Times, as well as working for Topps, and at first was pessimistic about a re-entry into the underground scene, which, with its emphasis on mere taboo-breaking - for example, Crumb's story, \"The Family that Lays Together Stays Together\" - seemed to him \"even more bankrupt\" than the milieu in which he was employed. But Raw proved to be a success, introducing a \"fine-art slant\" to the comic strip, as Dez Skinn, the author of Comix: The Underground Revolution (2004), puts it. \"Raw's publishing schedule was erratic, to say the least, with only eight issues published between 1980 and 1986, but what it lacked in quantity it made up for in quality. It launched the careers of dozens of cartoonists and artists, from Charles Burns to Gary Panter.\" Koren says Spiegelman \"has been very generous to other people who are doing the same sort of thing as he does. He has been a helpful mentor to a lot of younger artists, such as Chris Ware.\" In 2001, Ware won the Guardian first book award for Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Kid on Earth. Selections from Raw were subsequently published in the US as Penguin paperbacks. The Spiegelmans later established Little Lit, described as Raw Junior. Spiegelman quips: \"We were trying to show that comics aren't just for grown-ups.\" The couple have two children: Nadja, 17, who is featured in No Towers, trying to talk sense into her freaking-out father, and Dashiell, 12, who has also been incorporated into comic strips. </p> <p>In Spiegelman's SoHo studio, described by the New York Times as \"also a kind of haphazard museum of comic-strip history\", he works on a computer for some projects and on paper for others. Beside his old-fashioned drafting table, on which he sketches by hand, is another desk with \"all the electronic toys\". Sometimes, he draws straight on to the computer, using a Wacom Tablet, a digital graphics pad, \"which I find a very great pleasure. It enables you to try things out, make some part of the picture bigger, smaller, yellow, red or whatever. Then I'll spit that out of the printer, bring it over to the table, put a sheet over it and continue drawing by hand, and then scan that in, and change it again. There are some panels of In the Shadow of No Towers that never saw a piece of paper, and some that only saw a computer at the last minute when I scanned them in.\" He laments, however, that the computer \"deprives me of the pleasure of an original\". </p> <p>The slow progress of In the Shadow of No Towers is characteristic. The original three-page version of Maus, which Spiegelman refers to frequently, saw the light of day in 1973, whereas Maus II, subtitled \"And Here My Troubles Began\", would not be published for almost another 20 years. \"I'm never really satisfied with what I've done. It's not a matter of how long does it take to make that many lines on a piece of paper. It's a thought structure. And comics, at least as I understand them, are very condensed thought structures. It has maybe more to do with poetry than it has to do with narrative prose.\" With Maus , he had \"the self-created deadline of chapters in Raw magazine, but I was working on all the other contents too, and there would come a certain point when everything else was finished except my damn chapter. As for In the Shadow of No Towers, when I did the first few of those plates, I really did believe that I wouldn't live to see them published. Now I feel that the world may be ending, but it's ending slower than I thought.\"</p> <p><strong> Art Spiegelman</strong><br> <strong> Born: </strong> February 15, 1948, Stockholm.<br> <strong> Educated: </strong> High School of Art and Design, Manhattan; 1966-68 Harpur College.<br> <strong> Married: </strong> 1977 Fran\u00e7oise Mouly.

  "<p><strong>Namco II: Ms Pac-Man </strong><br>Console</p> <p>In the days before videogames became a multi-billion global industry, when Nintendo was still making playing cards, if you wanted to play a game it was more than likely made by Waddingtons or MB. Then, in the 1970s, TV games arrived, allowing you to plug in and enjoy the awesome power of bat and ball in the comfort of your own home. In the 21st century we naturally expect a bit more, and the latest battery-powered no-nonsense 1980s arcade simulators feature five classic games and no need to mess about with cartridges or DVDs. This one features Ms Pac-Man (easily the best Pac-Man variation); the excellent Galaxian-style Galaga; good, but tendonitis-inducing Xevious; sorely ageing Pole Position; and poor old also-ran Mappy. Batteries not included. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Namco, \u00a325</p> <p><strong>ShellShock: Nam '67 </strong><br>PS2, XBox, PC</p> <p>Setting out to communicate the harrowing life of a grunt in the Vietnam war, ShellShock goes out of its way to present a warts and all view of the conflict and the American and North Vietnamese armies. What emerges is harrowing only in its lumbering awkwardness. Your team mates are not only indestructible - able to walk about amid machine gunfire without injury - but also ineffectual, shooting for hours into groups of suicidal VC without any perceptible result. Meanwhile, missions around your marine fire base offer little more than excuses to listen to your colleagues swearing.

  "<p><strong>Saturday August 28</strong></p> <p><strong>They Live By Night </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1948) <br>1.50pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Kicking off a Nicholas Ray season this week on BBC2 is this marvellous combination of love story and crime thriller. Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell are the young sweethearts forlornly trying to escape the attentions of his former convict allies, Jay C Flippen and the thoroughly menacing Howard da Silver. </p> <p><strong>Bigger Than Life </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1956) <br>3.25pm, BBC2 </p> <p>More Ray: James Mason produced as well as stars in this account of a schoolteacher who seems to have been saved from a fatal illness by the experimental wonder-drug cortisone - then starts to undergo frightening personality changes. A little masterpiece. </p> <p><strong>Terminator II: Judgment Day </strong>(James Cameron, 1991) <br>9.10pm, ITV1 </p> <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the cyborg from a machine-ruled future world, making mayhem in the present: but this time he's the good guy, defending surrogate family Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong against state-ofthe- art terminator Robert Patrick. The latter's liquid-metal body transformations are eye-boggling, and the sequel is even more explosive than the original. </p> <p><strong>Sunday August 29</strong></p> <p><strong>Thoroughly Modern Millie </strong>(George Roy Hill, 1967) <br>3.50pm, ITV1 </p> <p>This thoroughly old-fashioned musical catches Julie Andrews still riding the crest of her Sound Of Music wave. Her Millie leaves provincial Kansas far behind to make it big in charleston-era New York, running into James Fox's surprisingly effective song and dance man on the way. </p> <p><strong>The Out Of Towners </strong>(Arthur Hiller, 1970) <br>3.50pm, Five </p> <p>Neil Simon's comedy about the misadventures of a hapless Ohio couple in the big, bad apple is so black it makes you wince while you laugh. Jack Lemmon is the exec who combines a job interview in New York with a little break with wife Sandy Dennis: big mistake. Soon the pair are suffering aeroplane diversions, losing their luggage, and missing out on their swanky hotel. Good, vicious fun. </p> <p><strong>Tigerland </strong>(Joel Schumacher, 2000)<br> 9pm, BBC2 </p> <p>The film that marked Colin Farrell as a big-screen action hero. In Schumacher's surprisingly lean and hard war movie, he plays a rebel soldier among the Vietnam conscripts undergoing hellish training at a jungle assault course called Tigerland. It's done in a deliberately low-budget style, with naturalistic performances and handheld camera work creating the immediacy of a documentary. </p> <p><strong>Magnolia </strong>(Paul Thomas Anderson, 1999) <br>11.05pm, C4 </p> <p>Anderson's follow-up to the brilliant Boogie Nights takes the piecemeal Altman approach of Short Cuts, weaving the thinly connected lives of a group of San Fernando Valley inhabitants into a deep and dark portrait of modern America. Among those under the spotlight are Jason Robards as a dying, guilt-ridden father, Julianne Moore his young wife and Philip Seymour Hoffman as his nurse; plus a bunch of people - including William H Macy - involved with a TV quiz show; but the real star turn is from Tom Cruise. The result is at times pretentious but utterly riveting, all the way to the extraordinary conclusion. </p> <p><strong>Thirteen Days </strong>(Roger Donaldson, 2000) <br>11.15pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Donaldson's gripping and powerful account of the Cuban missile crisis recreates all the paranoid fears and tensions that brought the world to the brink of nuclear armageddon in 1962. Resisting the hawks' urgings for a pre-emptive strike against the Russians was President John F Kennedy's finest hour, and Bruce Greenwood's spot-on performance, allied to David Self 's script - a fascinating study of a game of double-bluff played for enormous stakes - do him full justice. With a surprisingly effective Kevin Costner. </p> <p><strong>Monday August 30</strong></p> <p><strong>A Woman's Secret </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1949) <br>11.25am, BBC2 </p> <p>Scripted by Herman J Mankiewicz, co-writer of Citizen Kane, Ray's drama incorporates a similarly ingenious flashback structure, but there the similarities end. This is otherwise a standard tale of murdered singer Gloria Grahame, her wealthy friend - and prime suspect - Maureen O'Hara, and Melvyn Douglas as the inquisitive guy trying to figure it all out. </p> <p><strong>An American Tail </strong>(Don Bluth, 1986) <br>1.20pm, ITV1 </p> <p>First and best of the four cartoon movies about mouse family the Mousekewitzes, tracing their emigration in the 1880s from oppressive Russia to the US where, Papa insists, there are no cats. He's wrong: there's Tiger (voiced by Dom DeLuise) the friendly feline for one, and he becomes the pal of young Fievel Mousekewitz. A delightful children's adventure. </p> <p><strong>The True Story Of Jesse James </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1956)<br> 2.30pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Despite the weakness of Hollywood pin-ups Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter as the James brothers, this is a thoughtful remake of Henry King's 1939 Jesse James. It explores the background of oppression from whence the legend sprang, and culminates in the lowdown murder by the Fords. </p> <p><strong>Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid </strong>(George Roy Hill, 1969) <br>3.25pm, Five This charming, lighthearted western features one of the great \"buddies\" pairings: Newman and Redford's affable, slightly dim outlaws remain forever freezeframed on the memory. Despite the sepia-toned nods towards authenticity and some Peckinpahesque slo-mo violence, it's really a mock western that comically deflates the traditional set-pieces of the genre: the train robbery, the fistfights and gunfights. Marvellously watchable. </p> <p><strong>Breakfast At Tiffany's </strong>(Blake Edwards, 1961) <br>3.30pm, C4 </p> <p>Edwards makes a sparkling, sophisticated comedy out of Truman Capote's slight novella. In Audrey Hepburn he has the living embodiment of the volatile and ever-so-chic Holly Golightly, flitting through Manhattan society but also suggesting the Lulumae from Texas she once was (\"She may be phony, but she's a real phony\"). </p> <p><strong>Murder On The Orient Express </strong>(Sidney Lumet, 1974) <br>5.35pm, C4 </p> <p>An Agatha Christie murder mystery as old-fashioned as a game of Cluedo: who killed industrialist Richard Widmark, on the train, with the knife? Albert Finney as Belgium's most famous character, the detective Hercule Poirot, must solve the case before the Orient Express hits Paris in a lustrous and fascinating thriller. With Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, John Gielgud and Vanessa Redgrave. </p> <p><strong>US Marshals </strong>(Stuart Baird, 1998) <br>9pm, Five </p> <p>Disappointing sequel to The Fugitive, the main problem being that Harrison Ford really has got away from this one and his substitute, Wesley Snipes, lacks Ford's brand of haunted gravitas. Still, there's some big action - a plane crash-escape; Snipes leaping from tower block to train - and, when all else fails, there's Tommy Lee Jones. </p> <p><strong>The Ice Storm </strong>(Ang Lee, 1997) <br>10.30pm, BBC2 </p> <p>A delicately crafted, superbly acted study of suburban morality in 1970s America: all self-consciously hip partner-swapping parties and inner torment. It focuses on the Hood family. Student son, Paul (Tobey Maguire) is returning home for Christmas, finding parents Kevin Kline and Joan Allen's relationship in deep freeze. </p> <p><strong>Working Girl </strong>(Mike Nichols, 1988) <br>11.25pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Witty, very deft romantic comedy with its heart firmly in the 1930s. Melanie Griffith is the secretary trying to go places in the company, but she is being exploited by imperious corporate woman, Sigourney Weaver. Harrison Ford is the other point in the triangle, shifting allegiance from Weaver to Griffith. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday August 31</strong></p> <p><strong>Twister </strong>(Jan De Bont, 1996) <br>8pm, ITV1 </p> <p>With a combination of the director of Speed and the SFX-heavy The Haunting and Michael Crichton, the man behind Jurassic Park, it's hardly surprising this is another dose of furious, simple-minded action. It follows a group of weird people who are trying to get into the funnel of a tornado to place a recording device. With Bill Paxton, Helen Hunt and Jami Gertz. </p> <p><strong>DOA </strong>(Rocky Morton, Annabel Jankel, 1988) <br>11.05pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Classy remake of Rudolph Mat\u00e9s 1950 film noir, which opens with a man waking up to discover he has been poisoned, and spends his last day hunting his own killer. Dennis Quaid is excellent as a drunken professor of literature; and Meg Ryan is top-of-the-class as the student who helps him meet the deadline - though Charlotte Rampling is more your noir femme. <strong>Wednesday September 1</strong></p> <p><strong>Raiders Of The Lost Ark </strong>(Steven Spielberg, 1981) <br>8pm, BBC1 </p> <p>\"Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?\" Nice Spielbergian touch to give his heroic adventurer Indiana Jones these little human fears and foibles. First, fastest and funniest of the Jones trilogy, with Harrison Ford's indestructible archaeologist chasing from Nepal to Cairo with feisty partner Karen Allen to whip the Ark Of The Covenant from under Nazi noses. </p> <p><strong>Crazy/Beautiful </strong>(John Stockwell, 2001) <br>11.30pm, BBC1 </p> <p>A likable, different-sides-of-thetracks teenie romance. Kirsten Dunst's Nicole is the spoilt daughter of a congressman, wasting her time at school; Carlos (Jay Hernandez) is the hardworking son of a poor Hispanic family in East LA. They fall for each other, of course, and rattle through the traditional trials of the genre, but it's engagingly played and wittily directed by Stockwell. </p> <p><strong>On Dangerous Ground </strong>(Nicholas Ray, 1951) <br>11.50pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Ray considered this an \"absolute failure\", perhaps because of the upbeat ending foisted on him by RKO. He's too harsh: it's a sharp noir thriller with a desperate, intense relationship at its core. Robert Ryan is terrific as a violent cop at the end of his tether, whose encounter with blind Ida Lupino offers a chance of redemption. </p> <p><strong>Mean Streets </strong>(Martin Scorsese, 1973) <br>12.40am, ITV1 </p> <p>Scorsese returns to the New York streets of his youth, all small-time crookery and looming mafiosi in a sharply naturalistic view of Little Italy. Volatile, muscular acting from Robert De Niro as twitchy, pork-pie-hatted punk Johnny-Boy and Harvey Keitel his more measured, more dangerous friend, Charlie, hanging around the bar. It crackles with energy - one of Scorsese's masterworks. </p> <p><strong>Thursday September 2</strong> </p> <p><strong>Pulp </strong>(Mike Hodges, 1972) <br>12.05am, BBC1 </p> <p>Hodges made this as something of an antidote to the brutality of his seminal British gangster film, Get Carter. Michael Caine, who played Carter, is again his star, playing a pulp fiction writer who finds life mirroring his art when the subject of the memoirs he is ghosting dies suddenly. His amateur detective work leads him into mob business in a well-written comedy thriller. <strong>Friday September 3</strong></p> <p><strong>His Kind Of Woman </strong>(John Farrow, 1951) <br>1.35pm, BBC2 </p> <p>This film noir out of Howard Hughes's RKO studio is a wild and wacky experience. Set almost entirely at night, it stars Robert Mitchum as a down-on-his-luck gambler who gets caught up in a plot to smuggle mobster Raymond \"Ironside\" Burr out of exile and back into the States. Sheer delight. </p> <p><strong>Rollercoaster </strong>(James Goldstone, 1977) <br>12.35am, ITV1 </p> <p>Mad saboteur Timothy Bottoms adds extra spice to the fairground rides when he arranges big dipper carnage: can health and safety man George Segal put the brakes on his evil blackmail scheme? It plays on all those roller-coaster fears of being hurled to oblivion, but it's no edge-of-the-seater.</p>",
  "<p>Some news in brief. The silver shoes, bought at Helmut Lang then put back in their box in shame after their first wear, found a natural home at Ruth and Frank's wedding. </p> <p>The problem before had been timidity: wedding day, they worked with my panic-buy grey cotton Dior suit (the planned outfit was ditched 21 hours earlier after a sweat test: in the heat, it made my back wet after five minutes), a blue-stripe Gap shirt, blurry grey check Marni tie and a navy polka-dot square from John Lewis in my top pocket. Maybe they fitted because our giddiness levels were joyously high - real-life silver shoe issues are ongoing. But my love for the genre continues: I'm awaiting a call from Poste (the best shoe shop around: it's on South Molton Street in London) when the delivery of silver brogues from Dries Van Noten turns up. </p> <p>Panic suit-buying bore another fruit - my first rugby shirt since the amnesty on them was announced at the spring/summer 05 shows. A red cotton knit from Jil Sander (dirt cheap at the end of the sales), it's spot-on for spring, which I wholeheartedly believe in preparing for now (as we're about to do with tulip bulbs). Strange how a rugby shirt, largely unchanged for decades, feels as if it's pushing forward what we see as modern. </p> <p>Quick high-street check. Topman's new Premium Tailoring line is arriving in-store, and is excellent: well-considered, sharply tailored suits at an admirable price. And back to Gap: that shirt I bought is one of many from an energised mix of colour, stripe and pattern. I stopped in the street when I saw them through the window. All right, not such a rare occurrence when I'm out spending, but there you go. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Charlie Porter is associate editor of GQ.</p>",
  "<b><b>\u00b7</b></b> If I dismiss an employee summarily for gross misconduct do I have to pay him for accrued but untaken holiday? <p>The answer to your question depends partly on the wording of your employee's contract of employment and partly on the Working Time Regulations (\"the Regulations\"). </p> <p>If the contract of employment provides that you do not have to pay accrued holiday pay in circumstances of gross misconduct, there is no need to make any payment. However, if the employee has not taken his annual leave entitlement under the Regulations, pro-rated for the part of the year that he has worked, he should receive payment in respect of this. Under the Regulations, an employee is entitled to four weeks' paid annual leave in any \"leave year\". This runs from October to October unless agreed otherwise. </p> <p>For example, if an employee with six weeks' untaken holiday is dismissed for gross misconduct half-way through the leave year, and his contract provides that he will not be paid for untaken holiday in these circumstances, he should receive payment for two weeks' holiday, i.e. half of his four-week entitlement under the Regulations. </p> <p>Alternatively, if his contract is silent on this point, he should receive payment for half of his full entitlement, i.e. three weeks. </p> <p>You should also check the employee's contract of employment if he has taken more than his accrued holiday entitlement at the time of his dismissal. You may have the right to a repayment if it has been agreed in writing. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> I work in a small company of 10 people. Halfway through the current holiday year, we have been told that we are no longer allowed to take time off when certain important meetings are taking place. It seems unfair that some people have already taken holiday without having to abide by the new rules. It is now going to be much more difficult to take holiday, avoiding important days in our own department's cal endars, avoiding holidays taken by other staff and agreeing with family members. I would be grateful for any advice before speaking to my line manager. </p> <p>While an employer is obliged to allow employees to take a certain amount of holiday, it is also entitled to refuse to allow holiday to be taken at inconvenient times. </p> <p>In a company of 10 people, it may be difficult if people are away on certain key dates (although requiring everybody to be at work does seem slightly excessive). In principle, therefore, there is nothing to prevent an employer from prohibiting you taking holiday on certain days, as long as it allows you to take your holiday during the year. </p> <p>I agree that it does seem un reasonable to introduce the rule during the holiday year, and perhaps you should request flexibility if this creates any particular problems relating to booking holidays. </p> <p>If any member of staff suffers a particular problem with this policy (i.e. having to cancel to pre-booked holiday, or being unable to find any time to take a holiday) I would suggest that they raise the matter informally at first, and, if that does not lead to a resolution, through your employer's formal grievance procedure. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Meriel Schindler is head of the employment group at solicitors Withers LLP.

  "What the Americans failed to achieve in Najaf with their tanks, the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani achieved with a motorcade. Having arrived in the Iraqi holy city on Thursday accompanied by thousands of ordinary Shia Muslims, he calmly took possession of the Imam Ali shrine where fighters loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr had been under siege from US and Iraqi government forces for three weeks. Yesterday, Mr al-Sadr's militiamen in Najaf began laying down their arms under a deal brokered by Mr al-Sistani. We can only hope it will last; if it does not, the future in Iraq scarcely bears thinking about. <p>This outcome may be portrayed in some quarters as a defeat for Mr al-Sadr; in reality it is only a tactical withdrawal. His militia is being allowed to melt away, no doubt to reappear somewhere else later on. Despite previous threats to arrest him, Mr al-Sadr is, in the words of one government minister, \"as free as any Iraqi citizen to do whatever he likes\". Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Mr al-Sadr has risen from minor rabble-rouser to significant if troublesome player with nationalist as well as religious appeal. His constituency is the marginalised and disaffected youth, and his rise is mainly the result of US mistakes and misjudgments plus, latterly, those of the interim government too. </p> <p>In Najaf, Mr al-Sistani has in effect come to Mr al-Sadr's rescue, providing him with a relatively face-saving way out of a bloody impasse. The more junior cleric has, for the time being at least, submitted to the superior authority of the grand ayatollah. Whether this will allow Mr al-Sistani to exercise much control over him is another matter. Mr al-Sadr, in his early 30s, can play a long game; the grand ayatollah, at 73, can not. </p> <p>Earlier this month, as the fighting started, Mr al-Sistani left Najaf for medical treatment in London - to return as the city's saviour. He has been criticised for his absence, though there was probably little he could have done until the warring forces exhausted themselves. As the highest Shia cleric in Iraq, he tends to stay out of day-to-day politics, keeping religion and state separate. He favours democracy (with good reason, since the Shia account for 60% or more of Iraqis). His caution exasperates many activists, but when he speaks - usually at a critical moment - everyone listens. In effect, Mr al-Sistani has proved he has a veto over significant change in Iraq. </p> <p>If it holds, the Najaf agreement will relieve the interim government of an immediate headache. It may also improve the prospects for bringing peace to other cities and for holding elections successfully next year. But the problem for prime minister Ayad Allawi is that it leaves his unelected and increasingly unpopular government further weakened. His huffing and puffing over Najaf, backed by American military might, brought only more bloodshed - until Mr al-Sistani came along and upstaged him. The deal that was brokered this week was essentially the same one the government had tried and failed to broker earlier, which certainly raises questions about its effectiveness. More than ever, Mr Allawi will now have to keep his mind on the grey-bearded figure over his shoulder. </p> <p>Mr al-Sistani's influence comes from his religious authority. In Najaf he has exercised that to good effect. When he chooses to use it, the ayatollah has a voice that speaks louder than gunfire. The Middle East could certainly do with more voices like that. But Iraqis might also consider whether religious authority is what a modern Iraqi state ought to rely on. Perhaps a better omen here were the thousands of Iraqis who accompanied the grand ayatollah on his mission to bring peace to the Najaf. If Iraq is ever to become more peaceful, it is from citizens like them rather than ayatollahs that supreme authority must come.</p>",
  "A law student escaped a speeding conviction yesterday by the novel method of proving that his modest hatchback could not get anywhere near the 115mph claimed by police. <p>Steve Lucas was astonished when traffic officers on the M62 trans-Pennine motorway told him that he had hit the figure - so far over the 70mph limit that he risked a heavy fine and disqualification. </p> <p>\"I was happy to put my hands up and admit that I was driving at 85mph,\" he said, \"but the idea that my little Fiat Punto 1.2 litre could manage 115mph was laughable. I decided to fight it on principle.\" </p> <p>Mr Lucas, 20, from St Helens, Merseyside, used his legal connections to find an independent traffic consultant who was prepared to test the Punto on a private racecourse. The car was driven to its limits at Bruntingthorpe test centre in Leicestershire last month and the evidence was just what Mr Lucas wanted. </p> <p>Mr Lucas told Crown Prosecution Service lawyers at Pontefract magistrates court, West Yorkshire, that every possible encouragement had failed to get the Punto beyond 104mph. Technical evidence backing the claim convinced the lawyers and the speeding charge was dropped. </p> <p>Mr Lucas, who could have been fined \u00a32,500 and given a six month ban had he been convicted, pleaded guilty to a second charge of driving without due care and attention. He was fined \u00a340 and said after the hearing that he was relieved at the way things had gone. </p> <p>His solicitor, Sean Joyce, called on other motorists to use similar legal defences if they felt that they had been unfairly charged by police. He said: \"There are hundreds of thousands of speeding tickets issued every year in this country and the vast majority of motorists simply lie down and accept it. </p> <p>\"This case shows that if people feel strongly as Mr Lucas did that the police are wrong, they should stand up and challenge them in the courts. If they are successful, they can also make an application for their defence costs to be reimbursed.\" </p> <p>Mr Lucas's benchmark case took place within miles of another speeding milestone, in 1990 on the A1M. Traffic patrols were outrun at speeds well over 104mph by a Lada. When stopped, the driver turned out to be a Russian rally ace.</p>",
  "The prisoners' hunger strike in Palestine is nearing the end of its second week. Three days ago, in Askar and then Balata refugee camps near Nablus, Israeli troops ran amok in the camps, making mass arrests, beating women and children, shooting civilians at will, and adding to the huge prison population - currently well over 7,500. According to Israeli sources, more than 650,000 Palestinian men and boys have gone through Israeli detention at some point in their lives. That is over 40% of the male population in the occupied Palestinian territories. At certain periods when the Israelis are trying to break Palestinian resistance, they imprison anyone they can get their hands on. For example, during the first Intifada Israel detained 50,000 Palestinians in a single year, representing 16% of the male population aged between 14 and 55 of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. <p>Just who are the military holding in these prisons? Mostly they are young, and most are detained illegally, without charge or trial. Generally, they are the most active members of their local community, and the majority are detained for non-military activities. Most of them have gone through what can only be called show trials, in military courts, where collaborators and undercover army officers testify against them in secret. </p> <p>Among them there are Islamic militants, party activists, and respected leaders such as Marwan Barghouti and Hussam Khader - thousands who are incarcerated for years without visitors, the ability to make phone calls, enough food, or basic rights. There are more than 600 children in these prisons. </p> <p>The conditions in the prisons cannot be believed. The facilities in which juveniles are held are exceptionally bad. In Megiddo and Ketziot military prison camps, which are run by the Israeli army, children are treated as adults and held in threadbare tents which offer little protection against freezing winters and scorching summers. Bedding consists of wooden pallets covered by a thin mattress, and there are four toilets and two showers for every section in which about 120 detainees are held. A young woman, Su'ad Ghazal, was punished for writing details about the terrible prison conditions in a letter to a French human rights organisation. </p> <p>Palestinian children are also detained in the Telmond Compound and Ramle Women's Prison, administered by the Israeli prison service, where they are locked in their cells for hours on end with, in some cases, only 45 minutes outdoor exercise allowed every two days. Many are forced to sleep on the floor due to overcrowding. Windows are boarded up with iron panels, which block out the light and intensify the heat in the rooms. The prison guards routinely and arbitrarily beat and humiliate Palestinian detainees. </p> <p>Though these are all political prisoners - held by foreign military occupiers - this hunger strike is not a political strike. The 2,269 prisoners who began the strike were asking for humane conditions, such as the cessation of public strip searches, the ability to use the telephone, to be able to see their families, and an end to arbitrary and indiscriminate beatings. These are not privileges or favours. The prisoners want the authorities to respect internationally recognised rules governing imprisonment. The minimum standards can be found in articles of the 1949 Geneva conventions, which should be applied to prisoners in occupied territories. Now more than 4,000 prisoners have joined the strike. </p> <p>How have the Israeli authorities responded to this appeal by Palestinian prisoners to be treated as human beings? When the strike entered its second week and the prisoners began to fall ill, the Israeli health minister, Danny Naveh, refused to allow them access to prison hospital facilities. \"Let them be treated where they lie ... we don't want these murderers in hospital,\" he said. </p> <p>The Israeli public security minister, Tzahi Hanegbi, announced to the press: \"They can strike for a day, a month, until death. We will ward off this strike and it will be as if it never happened.\" He has ordered large, open grills to be set up to barbecue meat and for bread to be baked just outside the prison doors, to torture prisoners with the smells. Prison guards are encouraged to eat all this in front of the fasting prisoners. On August 13 Hanegbi announced that, as far as he was concerned, the prisoners could \"starve to death\". </p> <p>When similar savage images and stories emerged from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, they turned the stomachs of those in the west who saw them. The international outcry was immediate and profound. Now the activities of another liberal democracy's occupying forces are on public display, yet the collective silence, and the complicity of the British and American press in not covering it, astonishes and bewilders Palestinians everywhere. </p> <p>Worse, the prisoners' predicament inside Palestine is simply a microcosm of the Palestinians' predicament outside the prison walls; for what the Israelis are doing to the prisoners inside their prisons they are doing to Palestinians everywhere - in their land and off it. The collective punishment, the contempt, the daily robbery - the prison gates are everywhere. </p> <p>The roasting of meat in front of a starving person is little different from the current expansion of huge new illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land, areas green from expropriated water, while Arab crops die of thirst. These settlements sit above the Palestinian refugee camps and towns, each cut off from the other by checkpoints, curfews and closures - with jobs lost, and soaring new levels of poverty and malnutrition that have shocked the already exhausted humanitarian agencies in recent months. The prison system is no different for Palestinians who are trapped just a few miles north of Israel. In south Lebanon, at Rashidyeh refugee camp, a lively group of young women told me a few weeks ago: \"When we leave school, there are no professions open to us here [more than 72 professions in Lebanon are denied to Palestinian refugees], we are prevented from going home, we have no travel documents, we cannot study at the university here. Our lives are over, we can't even leave the camp.\" </p> <p>This is, perhaps, the most difficult moment that Palestinians have had to face. It is essential for those who care for peace and justice to show solidarity at this time with our struggle for emancipation. It is the moment to speak up, to remind those in power that until Palestine is free, citizens all over the world are not living in democracies either. It is the moment to make direct and practical gestures of support and to connect with those holding fast to their dignity. </p> <p>The Palestinians themselves are not passive - they are striking, which is an act of hope and of courage. To write directly to them, to demonstrate, to get busy organising relief and aid for them, to campaign on their behalf until this dark moment has passed, means that solitary confinement will be felt only by those who are oppressing them. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Karma Nabulsi is a research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford and the author of Traditions of War: Occupation, Resistance and the Law </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:director.civitas@nuf.ox.ac.uk\">director.civitas@nuf.ox.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "Almost everything is conspiring against Jean MacColl's campaign for justice, four years after her daughter, the singer-songwriter Kirsty, was mown down by a motorboat while diving in Mexico. <p>The man who was convicted of wrongful killing, a young employee of a Mexican supermarket magnate, was probably not behind the wheel of the speedboat at the time. </p> <p>At any rate he avoided prison by paying one peso for each day of his two years and 10 months term - which amounted to a \u00a361 fine and damages of \u00a31,250. Local authorities closed the case last year, and a federal prosecutor rejected Mrs MacColl's request to bring it under federal jurisdiction. </p> <p>The 81-year-old former dancer and choreographer admits the odds are not in her favour. \"It's one step forward, two steps back. We are going to carry on fighting until we win,\" Mrs MacColl said in London. \"We are fighting impunity and corruption.\" </p> <p>The Justice for Kirsty campaign is pinning its hopes on new evidence it claims to have found that will be revealed in a documentary to be shown in the Edinburgh TV festival today. </p> <p>At the time of her death Kirsty MacColl, best known for the 80s hits There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis and her gritty duet Fairytale of New York with Shane MacGowan, was enjoying critical acclaim for her Latin-inspired new album Tropical Brainstorm. </p> <p>She was on holiday on the island of Cozumel, just off Mexico's Yucatan's peninsula, with her two teenage sons after completing a radio series on Cuban music. </p> <p>The 41-year-old singer set out at midday on December 18, 2000 for a part of the Chankanaab reef favoured by local diving instructors as an easy and spectacular introduction for novice divers like her children. </p> <p>Ivan Diaz, their experienced dive master, said they had just surfaced when the speedboat Percalito bore down on the group. </p> <p>\"Out of the corner of my eye I saw the boat coming directly towards us very fast. I realised that it wasn't going to change course and was going to run us over,\" Mr. Diaz said. \"I heard a thump and a crack and then I saw the stain of blood spreading out in the water. It was Kirsty's blood.\" </p> <p>MacColl was almost sliced in two by Percalito's propeller, dying instantly, after pushing her eldest son Jaime out of the way. He suffered minor injuries. Mr Diaz got himself and her youngest son Louis to safety unhurt. </p> <p>The Mexican supermarket chain owner Guillermo Gonzalez Nova, two sons, a daughter-in-law, her baby and a young employee called Juan Jose Cem Yam were on the boat. Mr Gonzalez Nova is the chairman of Mexico's second-largest retailing group. </p> <p>Cem Yam confessed to being behind the wheel despite having no licence or boating experience. In March 2003 he was convicted of wrongful killing and sentenced to two years and 10 months, which he avoided by buying himself out of jail. The fine he paid was set low because of his clean record and low salary. </p> <p>Mrs McColl hired a private investigator, and according to the documentary he discovered that Percalito was travelling at several times the speed limit in a restricted area of the marine park, and that Cem Yam was not at the controls. </p> <p>If this is true, either Mr Gonzalez Nova or a member of his family was at the wheel. In addition the family's claim that the boat was in open water and travelling at only four knots must have been false. </p> <p>The divemaster Mr Diaz said he saw Cem Yam at the back of the boat. The documentary claims that other potential witnesses were either not called to court or were too frightened of giving evidence against a powerful family with a holiday home on the island. </p> <p>If Cem Yam is innocent, it would not be the first time in Mexico that the poor and powerless have been held responsible for actions of others. </p> <p>\"It is very common for an employee to be made a scapegoat in a case involving an important family, particularly in the provinces,\" said Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a criminologist who added that the rise of human rights groups has begun to attack this phenomenon. </p> <p>Mrs MacColl's Mexican lawyer, Demetrio Guerra, insists there is no question but that the investigation was plagued by negligence. The only hope of a retrial, he says, is to get the case admitted to federal jurisdiction on the grounds that the accident took place in federal waters. </p> <p>None of this deters Mrs MacColl. \"Kirsty was not a pop star in the sense of all the razzmatazz that usually goes with that,\" she said. \"She was so honest and open and down to earth and generous of heart. She fought injustice in her way and that's what I am trying to do for her.\"</p>",
  "The last-minute deal that halted the fighting in Najaf was being seen yesterday as a face-saving arrangement for all sides in the protracted and damaging conflict. <p>However, it is one that appears to defer a number of key issues surrounding Moqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi army militia - storing up trouble for the future. </p> <p>A five-point peace plan was hammered out late on Thursday in dramatic circumstances by the country's senior Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and the radical cleric, Mr Sadr. </p> <p>It called for Najaf and Kufa to be declared weapons-free zones; for all foreign forces to withdraw from Najaf; for police to take charge of security; for the government to compensate those harmed by the fighting; and for a census to be taken to prepare for elections that should take place by the end of January 2005. </p> <p>If it holds - and there are few certainties in Iraq at present - it will buy precious time for Ayad Allawi's beleaguered interim administration as it nudges the country toward national elections. </p> <p>The government's dilemma over the crisis had been acute. An all-out assault on the Najaf shrine risked inflaming mainstream Shia opinion. But if it failed to stop or contain Mr Sadr, then officials worried that his militant brand of Shia Islam would have gained further momentum, threatening the unity of the country. </p> <p>The agreement enhances the standing of the moderate Mr Sistani as a crucial force for stability in the fluid, often violent world of post-Saddam Shia politics. Iraq's senior cleric has for now seen off the most serious challenge to his authority from the young Mr Sadr, who lacks the ayatollah's religious standing but whose populist anti-American agenda has won support from the young Shia poor. </p> <p>However, there is in all this a tacit recognition of the emergence of Mr Sadr - who has until now withstood the might of the US military - as a rival centre of power who cannot be ignored. </p> <p>A disenchanted government minister said: \"Our past mistakes have turned Mr Sadr into a player. He still has his army, but he is now a political problem and not just a military one. And he won't be going away soon. With every crisis he emerges on top and stronger than before.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr's opponents point out that two important issues were not addressed in the Sistani accord: the future of the Mahdi army; and whether Mr Sadr would be tried for the assassination of a rival moderate Shia cleric in April 2003. Mr Allawi, the prime minister, has assured Mr Sadr that his arrest will not be expedited. But there are no guarantees beyond the life of the interim government, which will cease to exist after the first round of national elections. </p> <p>Iraqi legal sources say there is sufficient evidence for Mr Sadr to answer, and that, if the rule of law is to mean anything, the rebel cleric must at some stage appear in court. </p> <p>The most important question, at least in the short term, is what happens to Mr Sadr's fighters. </p> <p>The government has repeatedly said it will not tolerate the presence of militias in Iraq. And Mr Allawi has urged militiamen to take advantage of an amnesty. But by the time of the peace deal, many fighters - most of whom were not from Najaf - had left the holy city and returned to their homes in Baghdad and the south, taking their weapons with them. There is no guarantee that they will not at some point resume military action. </p> <p>Salama al-Khafaji, a prominent Shia member of the new Iraqi National Council who played a role in the mediation, said: \"Ayatollah Sistani's initiative solved the immediate issue of the ceasefire. And we needed some spark to put out the fires, without burning either the government or Mr Sadr. But the real problems lie not only in what happens in Najaf but in many other troubled parts of Iraq. What will happen to the Mahdi militia in Kut, Amara or Sadr City? We urge them to disarm and take part in the political process.\" </p> <p>Others believe that once Mr Sadr is drawn into the political process, his rabble-rousing skills will lose some of their potency and he will soon be marginalised. </p> <p>But the Sadrist movement has organised at the community level, providing services such as garbage collecting and directing traffic, filling in the gaps left by official municipal authorities, and trying to create an alternative local government structure in the poor urban Shia areas under its influence. </p> <p>Besides this, there is little doubt that his Iraqi Arab nationalist populism has struck a chord with thousands of mainly young, poor and disaffected Shia. </p> <p>Mr Sadr demands an immediate withdrawal of US troops from the country and refuses to cooperate with the interim government, which he regards as a puppet of Washington. He wants a strong central Iraqi government and opposes Kurdish demands for federalism. </p> <p>In contrast to the \"quietist\" Shia trend represented by Mr Sistani, Mr Sadr believes in theocratic rule and wants sharia as the law of the land. He would also like to see a governing system in Iraq similar to the Iranian model, where elections would be held but real power would be wielded by the clergy. </p> <p>\"If that is what the Iraqi people decide they want, then they will have it,\" said a senior government official. \"But that decision should be made at the ballot box and not at the end of guns.\"</p>",
  "Seven thieves stole a 13-metre bridge near the town of Mostar in southern Bosnia, the police said yesterday. <p>Over several days they dismantled the metal bridge built 150 years ago when the region was under the control of the Austro-Hungarian empire, transported the parts to a local scrap yard and sold them, the police statement said. </p> <p>Although it all happened in a remote mountainous region, villagers saw the thieves loading parts of the bridge into vans and alerted the police. </p> <p>Seven suspects were arrested and are being held pending a prosecutor's decision. </p> <p>Without giving names, the police said they were from the Roma community, and had sold the metal for \u00a395.</p>",
  "The Israeli military has arrested two soldiers on suspicion of murdering an unarmed Palestinian and arrested two officers from their platoon for allegedly trying to cover up the killing. <p>The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said prosecutors at a special hearing in Tel Aviv accused the men of \"deliberately shooting an innocent man who was not behaving suspiciously\". It said the suspects were in custody. </p> <p>A soldier is on trial for manslaughter over the 2003 killing of the pro-Palestinian British activist Tom Hurndall and an officer has been convicted of causing Palestinian deaths by negligence. </p> <p>The latest case, however, is the first since the September 2000 outbreak of Palestinian-Israeli fighting where the charge is murder, Yediot said. </p> <p>The paper said one of the suspects, urged by the other, shot the man during operations in the Gaza Strip last October, then told superiors he had shot a hostile gunman.</p>",
  "<p>John \"Motty\" Motson insists: \"No, I am not a Tottenham fan. I think the reason people sometimes think I support Spurs is because, for a while, they employed me to do the interviews on their telephone services. </p> <p>\"Most clubs had 'Club Call' but Tottenham had 'Spurs Line'. You could dial an 08 number and get me doing an interview with Chris Waddle or one of the other players. </p> <p>\"I commentated on two of Tottenham's Cup Finals in the early 80s - in one there was the famous goal by Ricky Villa. In the 1991 Cup Final they played Nottingham Forest and I had to say: 'I'd better drop out of this because it seems like I've got a vested interest here' - it was the match when Gazza went mad and got carried off.\" </p> <p>John says that many people imagine that a football commentator's working hours are a doddle. </p> <p>Far from it. He says he spends many hours in his study at home researching. </p> <p>\"For a Saturday game I would start on a Thursday afternoon,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I've got a library full of reference books and I would also want to watch some of the teams' recent matches. On Friday I would draw up a chart. I have an old-fashioned pencil case with felt tips. I use different coloured pens and work on various sequences. If a team is playing in blue, I would use a blue felt tip but perhaps write their Christian name in black. </p> <p>\"I might do the numbers in green and I would write biographical notes by each player. I look at what the scores were when they met before. </p> <p>\"It's like preparing for an exam. By the time I get to the ground on Saturday, I've committed most of it to memory. But if I do need to look down at the chart during a game, things come back to me.\" He says that viewers today are particularly knowledgeable and that people are always at the ready to trip him up. </p> <p>He lives near St Albans in Hertfordshire with his wife Anne and son Frederick. One of the reasons he lives there is that it's easy to get on the M1. \"I normally drive myself to matches. I can be in Villa Park in an hour and a half, and it's easy to get to Arsenal or White Hart Lane. While I'm driving I like to rehearse the names and the numbers in my head.\" </p> <p>When he arrives at the ground - usually three hours before kick off - he does a quick technical check up. \"Then I might go to the dressing room and talk to the team managers. At 3 o'clock I sit down and for two hours I do a live unscripted broadcast.\" </p> <p>His main work space is the commentary box. \"My work space on the gantry is very small; I'm pretty cramped up there with my two little monitors and my sheepskin coat.\" </p> <p>The coat is a big thing. \"I've had seven or eight. When they wear out it's very difficult because you can't go into any retail outlet and buy a full length sheepskin coat. You can buy half-length but I need full length to keep me warm in cold, camera gantries.\" </p> <p>He says that many people think that his work consists of the hours spent in the commentary box. Not so, he says. \"I have to watch the other channels; I watch live football on Sky. A lot of my job is organisation - planning for the next international match. I've done eight World Cups and eight European Cups and in 33 years I've been to 49 different countries. </p> <p>\"When you're up country or abroad you have to do the listings in your hotel room the day before. Being a football commentator is a full-time job. I'm in a routine and there's nothing else I'd rather be doing. </p> <p>\"It's a hobby, as well, and it doesn't seem like work much of the time but you still have to keep your eye on the ball.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Motty's Year by John Motson is published by BBC Books.</p>",
  "<p>What is your \"spending profile\"? Do you shop at a limited range of stores and mostly near to home? Then you could be shocked if you spend outside your \"profile\". Your debit or credit card could be rejected, leaving you red-faced, as banks use ever more sophisticated techniques to catch fraudsters. </p> <p>I recently ordered a new bathroom suite over the phone and was sorely embarrassed when the sales assistant informed me, \"unfortunately your debit card has been declined\". </p> <p>My instant reaction, I'm afraid, was to accuse my husband of forgetting to transfer the required \u00a32,300 from our savings into our joint current account as promised. Not so, retorted my offended spouse. He had in fact played safe by transferring \u00a34,000. He made a highly indignant call to the bank, Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>The reason my debit card payment had been declined, explained the bank, was that the transaction had been picked up by its computerised fraud detection system as being unusual and outside the normal pattern of spending on our account. </p> <p>Once the bank had verification that we were who we said we were and not card thieves out to bag ourselves a free bathroom, the stop on the payment was lifted. </p> <p>But, given the embarrassment and time-wasting hassle involved, I was still miffed at Lloyds TSB. Did this mean I needed to inform them each time I was going to spend bit more of my money than usual? And should I tell them if I planned to use my card abroad, for example, if I wanted to avoid washing dishes as a method of supper payment? </p> <p>Now, though, having spoken to several major banks about the murky world of card fraud and the all-singing, all-dancing systems they use to check for sudden and unusual spending habits, I feel more mellow. </p> <p>These \"neural network\" fraud detection systems with names like Falcon and Iris do sound clever. \"They are intelligent systems which learn as they go. They keep one eye on the customer's spending and transaction pattern and one eye on spending patterns typically used by card fraudsters,\" explains a spokeswoman for Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>By marrying up all the variables the system can then detect suspicious transactions that may be fraudulent and need checking before they are given the go-ahead. </p> <p>When a customer is present with their debit card and the transaction is flagged up in this way, the retailer will get a message at the point of sale saying: \"refer to bank for authorisation\". </p> <p>The onus is then on the retailer to call the card issuer, who will speak to the customer to verify their identity. In reality, though, many shop assistants (especially if there's a queue) simply ask for an alternative card, and misinform the customer that their card has been rejected. </p> <p>An HSBC spokeswoman says: \"We have worked closely with other banks and merchants to make it as quick for the customer as possible and to put them to the least inconvenience. We will ask the customer random security questions. </p> <p>\"The whole process should take a matter of a few minutes. Once the check is complete, provided that all the answers are correct the transaction will be processed as normal and the customer can carry on with their day.\" </p> <p>The banks say that customers are not generally put out by such checks once they realise that they form part of the fight against card fraud. \"In an ideal world you wouldn't need these fraud detection systems and the inconvenience they can cause,\" says a spokesman for Barclays. \"But back in the real world, the checks mean less hassle all around and less money going into fraudsters' pockets. </p> <p>\"Customers need to understand that they are nothing to do with your creditworthiness and no reflection on the funds in your account. They are carried out simply because we are trying to stop other people spending your money.\" </p> <p>And the technique is very successful, Barclays adds. \"For every 10 accounts we have a referral on, one of them turns out to be fraudulent. Given the one million transactions a day, that's a lot of fraud being stopped.\" </p> <p>Identity checks are not so straightforward where you are buying something over the phone, by mail order or online. Operators like Visa therefore rule that banks can only accept or decline payments made in this way - they cannot refer them for authorisation. </p> <p>Faced with a card-not-present transaction flagged up as unusual or suspicious, most banks, including Lloyds TSB, Barclays and NatWest, say they will decline the payment. They'll then try to contact the customer quickly to carry out identity checks and make sure the transaction is genuine. </p> <p>\"One key thing customers can do to avoid delays and problems is to make sure their bank has up-to-date contact details for them, including mobile numbers,\" says a NatWest spokesman. </p> <p>Many customers beat them to it and contact the bank themselves. So it's worth keeping your bank's contact details to hand. </p> <p>However, it seems that one bank's customers don't need to worry about being left red-faced. A Halifax spokesman says: \"In cases like yours where a card-not-present transaction is flagged as unusual, we allow that payment to go through so that the customer is not inconvenienced. </p> <p>\"Then we contact the customer immediately to check the transaction was legitimate. If not, we will freeze the card and advise the retailer not to send out the goods. </p> <p>\"If we can't get hold of the customer, we will monitor the next transaction on the card and, if that is suspicious, we freeze the account and stop all payments. It's important to stress that in neither case will the customer be liable for fraudulent losses.\"</p>",
  "<b>Portman is charging us \u00a3900 for vendor's delay</b> <p>In April, my daughter arranged a 4.99% five-year fixed rate mortgage with Portman (a Jobs &amp; Money best buy). </p> <p>On May 11, she exchanged contracts. She agreed not to press the vendor for an early completion, as he was awaiting completion of a new build, due at the end of June. </p> <p>In fact, it took until August 18 and we now had two weeks to complete. </p> <p>On the very next day (August 19) she received a withdrawal of offer on the mortgage as it had now expired. The new offer from Portman is at 5.99%, costing an additional \u00a3900 over five years. We got into this situation solely by assisting the vendor, and not realising the consequences. </p> <p>In my view Portman, the mortgage arranger, and my daughter's solicitor, all of whom are earning fees from us, were negligent in not warning us of the impending deadline. </p> <p>However, of course none of them will accept any share of blame, and Portman is quite intransigent about the withdrawal of the offer. </p> <p>My daughter can ill afford additional repayments: she is 20 and in her first job, and took a fixed rate quite deliberately so she could afford it. </p> <p>She now effectively has three days to accept a \u00a3900 \"penalty\", find another deal (impossible of course) or persuade Portman to change their mind. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money needs to highlight this absurdity of withdrawing an offer between exchange and completion, and put a very heavily marked timeline in the \"How to Buy a house\" column.<br><b> Peter Simpson</b><br>Ormskirk, Lancashire </p> <p><b>Advisers must make the risks crystal clear</b></p> <p>I heartily agree with letter writer Alan Ferris last week, that financial advisers should make risks crystal clear - in fact, we should have legislation to make them do just that. </p> <p>I invested in GE Life High Income Growth Plan 4 for an over-advertised return of 10.25%, as did Alan Ferris.

It shouldn't be</b><br> </p> <p>I sympathise with your reader, Alan Ferris, who feels let down by the \"execution only\" IFA who sold him the GE Life High Income and Growth Plan 4. A few weeks ago I came across an old letter addressed to me and dated June 1 2001 from Financial Discounts Direct, an \"execution only\" discount IFA. </p> <p>The letter begins: \"Dear Mr Briggs, I am writing to bring to your attention the new [GE Life] High Income and Growth Plan V, which I consider an outstanding investment opportunity, not to be missed\" and is signed by the company's managing director. </p> <p>The promised returns from this bond were 10.25% fixed annual income or 33% growth. </p> <p>As with Mr Ferris' experience with Chase de Vere, the letter goes on to say: \"Since the [EURO STOXX 50] Index was introduced in January 1992, full capital would have been returned on 100% of all similar products using the same investment formula. On average, the Final Index Level would have been 182% of the Initial Index level.\" </p> <p>Finally, in the small print is written: \"This is a direct offer advertisement and is not personalised investment advice.\" So I have a letter addressed to me personally from the managing director of Financial Discounts Direct with a very strong endorsement of the product. But I have to refer to the Key Features document to find out the penalties if the criteria for full return of capital are not met. </p> <p>I'm sincerely glad I did not invest in this product. I cannot believe that \"I consider it an outstanding investment opportunity, not to be missed\" does not constitute investment advice.

  "<p>Thousands of victims of financial mis-selling will be forced to pay tax on their compensation payments, it was revealed this week. </p> <p>In a stark warning, the Inland Revenue said successful claims would be liable for tax where part of the award was compensation for loss of interest. </p> <p>For instance, with-profit bond mis-selling victims, many of whom saw their income cut, or their capital largely disappear, are often compensated for loss of interest. A large element of their compensation will be based on the interest they would have enjoyed from putting their cash in a deposit account. </p> <p>Endowment victims have, in some cases, been made awards for loss of interest and they could also face a nasty tax bill. </p> <p>Many insurers have been deducting tax at source to satisfy the tax rules. Norwich Union says it applies the 20% standard savings tax rate to all claims where part of the award was for loss of interest. However, the Association of British Insurers admits some insurers rely on customers to make their payments. </p> <p>Critics say the Inland Revenue's decision to tax a portion of compensation awards contradicts the spirit of the compensation rules set up by the government. They also say the arrangements are flawed and should be reviewed before any further tax deductions are made. </p> <p>Chas Roy-Chowdhury of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, says: \"The idea of trying to capture tax on this money after the event, is unacceptable. Many people have suffered severe financial hardship and risked losing their homes as a result of financial mis-selling. </p> <p>\"It is also highly probable that many of those have already allocated most of the compensation received to repay the huge deficits in their mortgages. The Revenue should draw a line under this issue and make such compensation payouts exempt.\" </p> <p>Tim Moore, co-founder of EndowmentClaims.biz, a no-win, no-fee compensation claims firm, said it was possible many endowment victims were higher rate taxpayers and could be forced to pay 40%, even though the gains on endowment policies are only ever charged at the standard rate. He says: \"We are therefore urgently seeking clarification on this matter from the Financial Ombudsman Service, and will be taking it up on our clients' behalf where appropriate. </p> <p>\"In cases where the person being compensated is in a higher tax bracket, they have good grounds for claiming additional compensation to cover any such tax liability.\" </p> <p>Mr Roy-Chowdhury says the interest payments could also relate to several years, or even decades. \"The customers would have paid the tax each year, but now they must pay on one lump sum, and may even be pushed into the higher tax bracket because of it.\" </p> <p>The Inland Revenue says the rules have been in place for some time and the publication of its tax bulletin, which seeks to clarify the situation, only confirms existing rules. The bulletin says that while pension mis-selling pay-outs and awards for personal injury are exempt from tax (in the case of pension mis- selling because it is specifically protected in the 1996 Pension Act) all other forms of compensation could be liable for tax. </p> <p>It says: \"While detailed approaches (of insurers) may vary, we understand that the broad aim of compensation payments is to put investors back in the position they would have been in had they not bought, or put money into, the product. </p> <p>\"One way of doing this is to refund the premiums (or other amounts) paid by the investor, together with an additional amount to compensate for the time he or she did not have use of the money. </p> <p>\"Where this is adopted, we consider there can be little doubt that the additional payment is interest.\" </p> <p>However, insurance experts said the vast majority of endowment awards qualified as \"ex-gratia\" payments and were not liable for tax. A spokesman for Norwich Union said most cases of compensation that included interest payments concerned with-profit bonds. </p> <p>Mr Moore said many of the claims handled by his firm included interest payments and clients had been forced to declare the interest element to the tax authorities. </p> <p>\"In our experience it is usually when someone has hung on to the policy thinking they need to keep it to make a claim. When they win their award they are compensated for the two or three years when they could have done something more profitable with the monthly payments,\" he says. </p> <p>He urged mis-selling victims who received awards to check whether interest was included and whether tax has already been deducted.</p>",
  "<p>Dr S's receptionist moves with an aloof, feline grace down the hall. I follow in her wake of Opium, feeling clumsy and inferior. At the examining room door, she turns to gesture me inside. Alone in the small room, I slip the paper smock over my clothes and struggle to fit my long hair into the paper cap. I can hear the blood pounding in my ears. I shift uncomfortably on the narrow exam table. How much longer? Five minutes? Fifteen? </p> <p>Then, miraculously, the door clicks open and Dr S enters the room, a tall, good-looking man of about 45, as handsome a deity as any Hollywood casting director could have dreamed up, wearing surgical scrubs which are somewhat rumpled and specked ever so slightly with traces of rusty blood. </p> <p>\"Hope! My dear, good morning. How are you?\" </p> <p>\"Fine,\" I say, which now that he's here is less of a lie. </p> <p>Dr S approaches me, standing so close I can smell the piney cologne rising off his warm skin. His brows knit together as he studies the bump on my lower lip, a flaw which I know is jarringly obvious in spite of my careful application of flesh-toned lipstick. \"We're going to fix this today.\" He presses the bump and I wince, not only because it hurts, but because I need to see the tender regret in his eyes at having caused me pain. \"Sorry. I've got to check a post-op patient, and then we'll begin. It will only be a few more minutes.\" </p> <p>When the door closes behind him, I feel I'll jump out of my skin. For the first time, the reality of the procedure hits me: it will hurt what he's going to do; how could it not? As if the painful bump and my pounding fear are not enough, the familiar blaming refrain descends upon me like a hammer - this is all your fault. You brought this on yourself. It is your punishment for wanting something so frivolous, so silly and wasteful. You vain, selfish fool. </p> <p>When the door clicks open again, my heart gives a bleat of joy. But it is only the nurse, come to lead me to the operating room. </p> <p>\"Hope.\" Dr S stands at the door. \"Before we begin, there's something I want to show you. Come in.\" </p> <p>To my surprise there is a woman on the operating table. She is dark-haired, doe-eyed, perhaps 40. Her body is draped in a white blanket. She blinks at me and smiles sleepily. \"This is Alix,\" Dr S says. </p> <p>On the white paper sheet beneath her head are half a dozen or so nickel-sized reddish blotches, where blood from an unseen wound had dripped. </p> <p>\"Alix just had what I like to call a 'lunchtime lift'. Have you heard of it? It's revolutionary,\" he says. \"State of the art. It gives the effect of a brow lift without any of the downtime.\" There's a surge of bravado in Dr S's voice; the voice of a showman, a salesman? I have no interest in a brow lift, so I do not know how to react. Dr S approaches the woman on the table, pressing one of her manicured hands in his own. \"Come closer, Hope,\" he scolds gently. \"Don't be shy.\" </p> <p>I feel a tinge of annoyance: this is supposed to be my surgery, my moment. Alix turns towards Dr S and smiles up at him; the look of trust and intimacy they exchange makes my throat ache with longing. </p> <p>\"Just look at her,\" Dr S says, his eyes still fixed on Alix. \"Isn't she lovely? She looks 25 years old.\" </p> <p>My smile, automatic, hides my confusion. I myself am only 23. </p> <p>\"You could benefit from this, too, Hope.\" Dr S returns the full wattage of his gaze on me. \"You're very girl-next-door, and this would give you an exotic, sort of foreign look. Here, let me show you.\" </p> <p>Exotic. Foreign. How can I resist a delicious, illicit offer to become someone I am not? Does Dr S see inside me, does he know that, if I could, I would shed my face and body, my very self, on his table as nimbly as a snake sheds its skin, in favour of becoming a beautiful stranger? Almost somnambulant, I allow Dr S to position me in front of an oval mirror on the wall. He stands behind me, putting his fingers on my temples, pulling the skin back and upward. \"Look,\" he says. His voice is low and so near my ear that the little hairs on my neck rise. The change in me, though subtle, is startling. My round, green eyes are now slightly uptilted, catlike, the eyes of an Italian movie star. I want what I see in the mirror, impulsively and fervently. </p> <p>\"If you do it today,\" Dr S says softly, \"at the same time as your lip, I'll only charge you one thousand. Usually I charge $1,600. I always give a break on multiple procedures.\" </p> <p>A beat passes. When I don't respond, he says, \"If you like, Alana can just throw it on your credit card.\" </p> <p>Of the three plastic surgeons I've been to, Dr S was the first who did not raise his eyebrows upon noticing my age on my chart. He did not fix me with a quizzical look as I ticked off the procedures I'd already had. Lips. Nose. Cheekbones. Lips again. From that first consultation, I could see that, with Dr S, nothing I asked for would be off-limits. It thrills me, the dizzy possibility of it. But it frightens me, too. Without the brakes of someone else's disapproval, real or imagined, to slow me, what procedures will I not undertake? How far will I go? </p> <p>\"What do you say, Hope?\" </p> <p>To refuse requires more assertiveness than I can muster. The stakes seem enormous: to risk losing Dr S's favour; to languish for ever in dreary girl-next-doordom. \"No!\" I cry. </p> <p>\"What?\" Dr S's brown eyes are round with surprise. </p> <p>\"I mean, yes! Sorry. I meant yes. Let's do it.\" Dr S's approving smile warms me like a rush of love. </p> <p>I recline on the operating table, giving myself up to the sterile ministrations of the nurse. It is to be a local anaesthetic. Dr S leans over me holding a large syringe. With my face tilted towards his, he could almost be leaning in for a kiss. </p> <p>Numb now, my lip feels thick as bread dough. The nurse dabs at my mouth with a square of white gauze, which comes away livid with my blood. I close my eyes. Vivaldi soars on the stereo. Dr S's hands on my face are cool and dry in their latex gloves. I am safe now. </p> <p>\"This is the thing the other guy is terrified of doing.\" He means the other surgeon, Dr R, who inserted the strip of Gore-Tex that is now pushing its way out of my lower lip. Gore-Tex is a synthetic material commonly used to insulate winter coats. It was supposed to give my lip a luscious, full look. But instead of a pretty pout, I got this unsightly, infected lump. A cyst, I told my roommates. </p> <p>\"Doctor,\" I say, a whisper, a slurred prayer. \"If there was an earthquake right now, and the power went out ... \" </p> <p>\"What would happen to you?\" Dr S finishes my thought. \"I wouldn't leave you.\" </p> <p>I wouldn't leave you. This is what I needed so much to know. If the ceiling collapsed, if he were hurt, if he had to stagger to attend my supine body, he would. Is this what love feels like, I wonder. </p> <p>My eyes flicker lazily. There is a small metal table beside me, a few inches from my face. Atop it, I see several bloody surgical tools. Casually, I regard my own blood, unmoved. But what is that other thing, that narrow strip of pale skin from which sprouts short, stiff brownish hairs like a squirrel's? What is this bit of roadkill on the surgical tray? </p> <p>My eyes strain to see the floor below. There, on the white linoleum, strands of my own long hair lie splayed in a messy heap. With a jolt it hits me. My skin. My hair. My own severed flesh on the tray. </p> <p>My breathing seems to halt. Calm, I tell myself, calm, calm. Breathe. Don't have a panic attack now. What's done is done. </p> <p>\"Are you all right?\" Dr S asks. </p> <p>\"Yes.\" It shocks me that I can feel such terror and speak so offhandedly. \"It's just that I'm staring at a chunk of my scalp on your table.\" </p> <p>After a beat, Dr S seems to register what I've said. His staccato laugh pipes out. \"Did you hear that, Jeanne?\" he says to his nurse. \"A chunk of her scalp. Beautiful and funny! I like that.\" </p> <p>His laughter washes over me. Beautiful. He thinks I'm beautiful. I close my eyes, trying to recapture the feeling of ecstatic surrender. I tell myself, you are the straw that he will spin into gold. </p> <p>I almost believe it. </p> <p>The heavy click of the deadbolt reassures me as I turn my key in the lock that my roommates are not home. As I'd hoped, the apartment is silent and still. I moved into the apartment from my parents' house a few months ago, after my fourth surgery, when my mother told me that she would not allow her daughter's \"self-mutilation\" to occur under her roof. </p> <p>My mother always performed best in her maternal role when there was something wrong with me. Whether it be a bad haircut or a cold, she became an engine of motherly concern. She would bring me magazines, soup; she brushed my hair; she hovered. Healthy and robust, I became somehow frightening. Damaged, I was a bird she could fold under her wing. But this was different. A case of the sniffles, a too-short fringe, or a lousy boyfriend were manageable ailments. This time, I had damaged the part of myself she both worshipped and feared: my appearance. </p> <p>I have heard that mother birds sometimes push their young out of the nest if they are sickly or deformed. As for my mother, she took one look at her disfigured offspring and fled the nest herself. She checked into the Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Rey and called my father with explicit instructions that she would not come home until I was gone. </p> <p>And so I found myself in this apartment, the fourth in a quartet of roommates, all single young women in their mid-20s. Every morning I lie in bed and listen to the three of them getting ready for work, for school, for whatever business or engagements their day may hold. Showers run; coffee perks. I listen to their preparations with a sense of wonder. How are they able to go out into the world each day, fresh and full of energy? How is it that I have lost the knack for everyday life? I can't imagine going to a job, even looking for a job. </p> <p>I had drifted in and out of graduate school the same way I drifted everywhere in my life. I had long ago lost interest in academic subjects, my early talent for creative writing eclipsed by my intense fixation on my appearance. My roommates must wonder about me, the new girl, who mysteriously doesn't work and whose days are unaccounted for. I'm polite, evasive, elusive. I prefer to remain anonymous. </p> <p>Now, in my bedroom, I catch my reflection in one of the mirrors on my wall. I'm startled, for a moment, at my uplifted eyes. I get up close to the mirror now, turn my face from side to side. I like my new eyes, I decide. They do look somewhat exotic; they will look even more so with dark make-up, perhaps some kohl liner. I will experiment, play with them as with a new toy; it will keep me busy for a while. </p> <p>My father's parents, Clayton and Eleanor Hathaway, were not the richest people in Hancock Park. There were the Van de Kamps and the Ahmansons and the Bannings. But my grandfather was revered because he handled something of utmost importance to them: he delivered their babies. My father's younger sister, Diane, still lived in her girlhood bedroom on the second floor. Diane suffered from an array of vague but never-ending physical ailments: stomach distress, fatigue, lightheadedness. </p> <p>My mother said the Hathaways didn't like her because she wasn't a society girl. But I suspected my mother needed to be fussed over to feel important, and the Hathaways were far too refined for fussing. Any excess of emotion had been bred out of them, like an overbright colour dulled by many washings. My father's family, too, had a certain established order. Each of us had a title and a role. My mother was the rogue. My grandmother was the genteel gentlewoman. My father was the good-natured goof. I was the pretty one. </p> <p>My mother's desire for me to be glamorous, stunning and charming - to dazzle my father's family - added to the pressure I already heaped upon myself. </p> <p>Snapshot: a sunny Sunday afternoon, my senior year of high school. No picture was taken on that day, but if it had been it would look like this: the three of us, my mother, my father and I, a perfect family trio, enjoying the day by our pool in Hancock Park. </p> <p>My mother is stretched out on the sun-warmed deck near the shallow end; I am lying on my stomach on a chaise longue at the other end of the pool. My father swims laps. Both my mother and I wear bikinis. I reach back and undo the clasp of my bikini top to tan my back. Relaxing under the molten heat of the sun, I close my eyes. </p> <p>My father finishes swimming his laps and gets out of the pool, hopping from foot to foot to shake the water from his ears. My father at 40 is a good-looking man. He has aged better than my mother. Whereas in youth he was scrawny and gangly, with age he has filled out into a broad-shouldered, well-built man, with a thick head of wavy, dark hair and blue eyes. He spreads his towel on the other chaise, beside mine; the lounger creaks under his weight as he flops on to it. I raise my head slightly, open one eye to smile at him. But he isn't looking at me. He is looking across the pool at my mother, who has abruptly got up, and is striding into the house without a word. Just before she steps through the door, she gives him a look of such mysterious searing intensity that I shiver under the hot sun. </p> <p>\"What's with her?\" I say, trying to be jokey, to make light of what I want to assume is just another of her mood swings. </p> <p>My father stares at the place where my mother had been as if she is still there. Something has changed, minutely, in the air between us. He says, in a stilted voice, \"I think I'll go in.\" </p> <p>My parents fight over the most trivial things; my mother's anger and unhappiness bubble up often and unexpectedly, like dinosaur bones in the nearby La Brea tar pits. I continue to lie outside by the pool, though my heart beats more rapidly now. Finally, I gather up my towel and go inside. </p> <p>Something is wrong. I feel it right away; my mother's rage hangs in the air like the stench of something rotten. Down the hall, from behind their door, I can hear my parents' animated voices. My father's, low and strained, is pleading, my mother's shrill and furious. </p> <p>Don't listen, I tell myself. I turn on the shower, one hand testing the water's temperature. There is a towel hanging on my bathroom door, but I tell myself I want a fresh one. Halfway down the hall to the linen closet, I freeze. My mother is screaming. \"What the hell is going on between you two?\" she shrieks. \"Why did you sit next to her? Tempting you, in that little bikini! I know exactly what she's doing, and I know what you're thinking, don't think I don't!\" </p> <p>I know it, I knew it, yet still it takes a moment to realise: she is talking about me. I look down at my breasts in the bikini top, the flat terrain of my belly, and freeze with terror. Dear God. </p> <p>I cannot hear my father's panicked, protesting response. Whatever he says only seems to inflame my mother further. </p> <p>\"You're attracted to her, aren't you?\" she wails. \"Admit it! She's young and beautiful, and I'm not! I'm not an idiot, you know. Don't think I can't see what's going on here, right under my fucking nose!\" </p> <p>\"I didn't sit by her, Virginia.\" My father's words are calm, measured and perfectly clear. Does he know he's lying, or is sitting by me simply not worth defending? I want to barge into their room, smack him, to shake him until he acknowledges me. I'm your daughter, for Christ's sake! What is wrong with sitting next to your own daughter! </p> <p>I slink back down the hall to my bathroom. I peel off my bikini, avoiding the sight of myself in the mirror. I turn on the water, so hot I can hardly bear it. I push my face into the scalding spray, willing it to burn away what I've just heard, to sear the pain that has opened up inside me. </p> <p>When I can't sleep, when there aren't any new magazines to distract me, when I can't possibly find another excuse to visit Dr S's office, these are the days when despair settles into my body like fever, making my bones ache. It is a misconception, the idea that depression is all in the head. I rush back and forth to the mirror, checking, always checking; for what? I'll think, what if I had bigger lips? I'll think about this for a while, play with the idea. What if I had bigger lips and a smaller nose? What would it take for me to be satisfied with my appearance? Answer: everything. Nothing. Nothing and everything. The riddle I am really trying to solve is: what will it take to make me happy? </p> <p>Mirror, mirror, on the wall, I just need larger breasts, that's all! Just this one little improvement and - happiness! Yes! Bigger breasts! All those other nagging, painful thoughts are eclipsed. All I can think about is how much better I'll look and how much more confident I'll feel with this thing, this change I want to make. </p> <p>Maybe, if I weren't so vain and squeamish, my obsession would have taken a more predictable form. I would stick a finger down my throat or dig a razor blade into my arm. Or step on the scale 50 times a day, count every calorie. Wouldn't all of these achieve the same purpose? Yes, but then again my fascination with plastic surgery feels so right. It is the perfect modern-day affliction for a poor little rich girl like myself. How appropriate that a Hathaway should choose a route to self-annihilation that is elaborate, expensive and essentially passive. I'm not brave enough to carve myself up in private; I've got to pay someone else to do it. </p> <p>What if I had bigger breasts? </p> <p>After the initial thought, obsession begins to take over. I am compelled to go through with it. It becomes a personal mission, a test of my resolve. </p> <p>I'm at Dr S's surgery; he sits down on a little stool beside me, and my heart lurches. </p> <p>\"Doctor!\" That word. \"I was thinking about breast surgery.\" The words spill out of my mouth in a breathless rush, like a sob. \"What do you think?\" </p> <p>Dr S gives me his full attention. \"Larger or smaller?\" he asks. </p> <p>His question startles me. Isn't it obvious? \"Larger.\" </p> <p>Dr S's face lights up. \"Breasts are my speciality,\" he says. \"Take off your shirt. Let's see what we have.\" I shed my shirt and bra, utterly unselfconscious. His eyes on my naked skin raise goosebumps along my arms and stomach. I put my arms at my sides, my exposed breasts like offerings. Dr S nods his head, looking slowly from one breast to the other. He reaches out to cup each breast in his hand, as if weighing it in his palm. It is all I can do not to cry out. </p> <p>\"The right one is a little bigger than the left,\" he says. \"But on the whole, you've got very nice breasts.\" </p> <p>I feel deflated. How can he not feel the heat, the intimacy of this moment? </p> <p>\"After the surgery, though, you'll have traffic-stopping breasts.\" </p> <p>After the surgery? I think, startled. I haven't decided yet. </p> <p>\"Your skin has wonderful elasticity.\" Dr S's voice is husky, but for me the moment is lost. \"You're very lucky, Hope. With your young skin and your frame, you can carry off a very large implant.\" </p> <p>\"I don't know if I would want very large breasts. The thing is ... I, uh ... I really haven't given it enough thought. I have to think about it.\" </p> <p>Disappointment - or is it some darker emotion? - clouds Dr S's face. \"Take your time,\" he says unconvincingly. He is poised at the door. He has other patients waiting to see him. Patients quicker to make a decision than me. I cannot take up any more of his time. \"Let me know what you decide,\" he says. </p> <p>I read this about suicidal people: sometimes, they decide finally to go through with it simply because they can't stand that little voice in their head any more telling them to do it, do it. They just want to stop the noise. The same is true for other compulsives. Self-mutilators, hair pullers: sooner or later, they give in to that little nagging voice. </p> <p>Do it, do it, do it . I can't tell any more if I really want bigger breasts, or if I simply want to stop obsessing about them. I stop by Dr S's office and ask his assistant to schedule the surgery. </p> <p>Four weeks later I feel as if there is a truck parked on my chest. I can't turn or breathe deeply or cry. I don't want to move from my bed. Once the morphine wears off, knives stab at my chest. Rolling over is out of the question. The exertion of getting up and taking a few steps makes me pant and weep with agony. </p> <p>It is April Fools' Day, and I have new breasts. </p> <p>Time passes, the pain eases but I am nearly broke. I need money. I tell myself that this is why I answer the ad, in the classified section of a local newspaper. The ad says, in bold letters: figure models wanted, no experience, fast $$$. I keep the ad for a week or so before answering it. I like the sound of it: Figure Modelling. It has a nice, artsy ring to it. Like something out of Degas. Of course, a part of me knows that it isn't going to be this innocent. Especially when the ad is placed alongside those advertising escort services, sensual massage, and phone-sex lines. I know I will not be posing chastely for a master drawing class. I know, too, that the reason I am answering the ad is not entirely because I am broke. </p> <p>It has come down to this. I am so caught up in my physical self that I believe it is all I have to offer, all that I am. I cannot fool myself any more that I am improving my life, that I am on a path to something significant, that Dr S will love me. </p> <p>There is no misery like the misery of being trapped in your own brain. The more I think about my problems, the more tied up in knots I become. I do not want to be alone, or pretend that I am not lonely. I don't want to pretend at all. I want connection and excitement and meaning. I looked for those things in Dr S's office and, for a time, I thought I found them there. A long, long time ago something important inside me got crushed, and that little wounded thing is still in there, tiny, afraid to unfold itself. I can't do this any more. </p> <p>I realise I need help </p> <p>\u00a9 Hope Donahue, 2004 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hope Donahue was diagnosed as having obsessive-compulsive disorder.

  "<p>Henry Kissinger gave Argentina\u2019s military junta the green light to suppress political opposition at the start of the \u201cdirty war\u201d in 1976, telling the country\u2019s foreign minister: \u201cIf there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly,\u201d according to newly-declassified documents published yesterday.</p> <p>State department documents show the former secretary of state urged Argentina to crush the opposition just months after it seized power and before the US Congress convened to consider sanctions.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t cause you unnecessary difficulties. If you can finish before Congress gets back, the better,\u201d Mr Kissinger told Admiral Cesar Augusto Guzzetti, the foreign minister, according to the State Department\u2019s transcript.</p> <p>Carlos Osorio, an analyst at the National Security Archive, a US pressure group which published the transcript, said it was likely to be seen by historians as \u201ca smoking gun\u201d.</p> <p>It is likely to be seized on by Mr Kissinger\u2019s critics who have been calling for him to face charges for abetting war crimes and human rights abuses in Cambodia, Chile and Argentina.</p> <p>The Argentine junta formed a secret pact in 1976 known as the Condor Plan with other South American dictatorships in Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay and Brazil for the eradication of \u201cterrorists\u201d. According to official figures, nearly 9,000 people disappeared in Argentina alone but human rights organisations put the figure nearer to 30,000.</p> <p>\u201cThe newly-revealed documents prove that as early as June 1976 Kissinger was informed of the existence of the Condor Plan,\u201d said Horacio Verbitsky, head of the Argentine human rights group Cels in Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Mr Verbitsky, who during the 1970s ran an underground news service, said Mr Kissinger made it difficult for the US embassy in Buenos Aires to pressure Argentina\u2019s generals on human rights violations. \u201cWhen US ambassador Robert Hill met with the generals to demand an end to the violence, the generals could say, your boss Kissinger knows what\u2019s happening and he doesn\u2019t care,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The documents include a state department transcript of a conversation between Mr Kissinger, then secretary of state in the Ford administration and Mr Guzzetti, on October 7 1976, six months after the Argentine military had seized power.</p> <p>By that time the regime\u2019s brutality had become clear. Mr Hill sent repeated notes to Washington, describing the abuses and his attempts to get the junta led by President Jorge Videla to stop the \u201cdisappearances\u201d of its leftwing opponents.</p> <p>But when Mr Guzzetti raised the issue at the October 1976 meeting at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, Mr Kissinger told him: \u201cLook, our basic attitude is that we would like you to succeed. I have an old-fashioned view that friends ought to be supported. What is not understood in the United States is that you have a civil war. We read about human rights problems but not the context. The quicker you succeed the better.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly. But you must get back quickly to normal procedures.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Kissinger remains an influential voice on foreign affairs in Washington. His office at his lobbying firm, Kissinger Associates, did not return calls seeking comment yesterday.</p> <p>William Rogers, a former state department official who attended the Guzzetti meeting and is now vice-chairman of Kissinger Associates told the Associated Press: \u201cIt\u2019s a canard ... The idea that he would tell another country to violate human rights quickly or slowly or under any circumstances is preposterous.\u201d</p> <p>The National Security Archive, which campaigns for government transparency and pursues the publication of classified documents, had received the transcript of the Guzzetti meeting in February, in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act. However, the key passages in the conversation had been blacked out. The organisation appealed and the deleted sections were reinstated.</p> <p>According to another state department document, Mr Hill said the Argentine generals had returned from their meeting \u201ceuphoric\u201d.</p> <p>In a memo from a top Kissinger aide at the state department, Mr Hill was assured that Mr Guzzetti had \u201cheard only what he wanted to hear\u201d, and that he had in fact been told \u201cthe USG [US government] regards most seriously Argentina\u2019s international commitments to protect and promote fundamental human rights..\u201d</p> <p>Mr Hill later found he had been lied to, and confided his disgust to Patricia Derian, a former assistant secretary of state for human rights who visited him in Buenos Aires in 1977.</p> <p>\u201cHe said Kissinger had admitted to him exactly what has now come out in the documents,\u201d Ms Derian told the Guardian</p> <p>\u201c... Kissinger has not been held to account for it. He\u2019s only been embarrassed. He has people talk for him and say he\u2019s misunderstood ... It\u2019s baloney,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "The chief executive of the Music of Black Origin awards (Mobo) promised yesterday to ask voters whether to drop homophobic dancehall reggae artists from the ceremony next month if the singers did not apologise for their lyrics. <p>Kanya King's pledge came after a leading black gay organisation joined calls for the Mobos to exclude Elephant Man and Vybz Kartel, who were nominated this week in the best reggae single category. </p> <p>The lobby group, Stonewall, has also backed the call, originally made by the gay rights group Outrage!, to drop the controversial artists. </p> <p>Dancehall stars are under pressure because of songs which allegedly incite violence against gay men and lesbians. J-Flag, the Jamaican gay rights group, believes homophobic lyrics have fuelled attacks and even murders in the country. </p> <p>Several artists have been threatened with the loss of sponsorship contracts and the Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether charges could be brought against singers including Beenie Man and Elephant Man, who sings \"Bun [burn] out a freaky [gay] man ...\" in one of his tracks. Vybz Kartel has sung about shooting gay men. </p> <p>Yesterday Ms King said: \"We are awaiting apologies from these artists. If we do not receive them we will be writing to our academy and asking them what we should do next.\" </p> <p>Earlier this week the Mobo organisers said that they did not condone homophobic lyrics and they had stressed this on the nomination forms, which are distributed to DJs, promoters and retailers. </p> <p>Their statement continued: \"People obviously did keep this in mind when voting, because the controversial Beenie Man didn't get the support he might have anticipated and as a result has not been nominated.\" </p> <p>Dennis Carney, chair of the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, said voters had not gone far enough. \"The Mobo academy have made a start in rejecting Beenie Man but now they have to show they are serious by dropping other performers who incite violence against gay people,\" he said. </p> <p>\"For too long, the diverse voices of black lesbians and gay men have not been heard in the debate about homophobia in music ... We also wish to celebrate our culture as black people; however, we reject the notion that homophobia is integral to black culture.\" </p> <p>The group is urging record labels, musicians, DJs and clubs to sign a pledge that they will not produce, play or promote music from performers who incite attacks on gay people, as part of a growing campaign to tackle hate-lyrics. </p> <p>Ben Summerskill, chief executive of Stonewall, said: \"[Mobo organisers] have acknowledged the issue when, historically, they refused even to entertain the idea that this was a problem. </p> <p>\"[But] logically if you are going to drop one artist for expressing these views, you ought to extend that to all artists. </p> <p>\"These singers haven't offered what I think people would consider an appropriate apology, or even a real acknowledgement of the damage and distress these lyrics have caused.\" </p> <p>Outrage! has said it will ask the home secretary to issue exclusion orders against the artists to stop them attending the awards ceremony in London on September 30.</p>",

  "For more than five years, Ryan Matthews sat in his 9ft by 6ft prison cell for 23 hours out of 24 contemplating how the state was going to take his life. Each day brought him nearer the one when he would walk to Louisiana state penitentiary's death chamber, be strapped to a gurney and receive a lethal injection. <p>Two weeks past his 17th birthday, the Louisiana teenager fitted every stereotype for those most likely to be sentenced to death: he was black, a child and had severe learning difficulties. More importantly, he was innocent. </p> <p>But Mr Matthews, now 24, is free after being exonerated thanks largely to British money and the efforts of British lawyers. Cash raised in this country, including a \u00a310,000 donation from Martha Lane Fox, the Lastminute.com entrepreneur, was crucial to securing his release. </p> <p>In his first interview since his release, he told the Guardian that his British supporters had saved his life. \"All these people who didn't know me but they cared about me and they cared about my case - they could see the wrong that was done. I want to thank them for believing in me and bringing me this far and giving me back my life.\" </p> <p>He was convicted of the 1997 shooting of a grocery store owner, Tommy Vanhoose, in spite of there being nothing to connect him to the scene of the crime. His friend, though, had confessed to police that he had been the accomplice and getaway driver. The friend, Travis Hayes, was also a juvenile and suffered from severe learning difficulties. He is still serving a life sentence for being an accomplice to a crime his friend did not commit. He says the police bullied him into making his confession and refused to testify against Mr Matthews in court. </p> <p>On that April night, the real killer - who shot Mr Vanhoose four times after he refused to hand over his week's takings - discarded the ski mask he had used to disguise himself. On it were found traces of spittle and sweat. When this was tested, the DNA did not match that of Mr Matthews. This did not deter prosecutors or the jury. </p> <p>\"The jury started hearing the evidence at 9.30am and finished at midnight, when they retired to consider their verdicts,\" said Shauneen Lambe, a British barrister who sat through the trial. \"At 4.40am they came back to say they were not unanimous, to which the judge said they must be. They returned 20 minutes later to say that they were unanimous now, that Ryan was guilty. It was shocking.\" </p> <p>Two days later he was sentenced to death. His family, who had been convinced that the jury would see sense, were stunned. </p> <p>It was while working on secondment in the US with Clive Stafford Smith - a British-born lawyer who has spent over 20 years in the southern US representing more than 200 people on death row and currently helps some of the British detainees held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay - that Ms Lambe began working on the case. She believed his original lawyers, public defenders appointed by the court, had done a poor job of representing him. </p> <p>Some time after the death sentence was handed down, rumours began filtering out of Louisiana's state prisons that a man called Rondell Love had been boasting that he had killed Mr Vanhoose. Love was serving 20 years for a murder committed half a mile from the grocery store killing and six months after the Vanhoose murder. </p> <p>After securing three statements attesting to Love's confessions, Ms Lambe returned to Britain seeking further funding for her investigations. </p> <p>The British-based group Reprieve, which helps impoverished people on death row, gave the case its full backing. Ms Lane Fox, who sits on its board, agreed to fund the case. Intensive investigations began and DNA tests proved that Love had been the wearer of the ski mask. </p> <p>In spite of that evidence, prosecutors resisted granting a new trial, only doing so a year later and on the night before hearings to review allegations that they had suppressed information about one of their main witnesses during the original trial. </p> <p>The retrial was not granted until April of this year and Mr Matthews remained in prison until June, when he was released on bail and placed under house arrest. By the beginning of this month, though, prosecutors conceded that charges should never have been brought and exonerated him \"in the interests of justice\". </p> <p>\"It is abhorrent that this could have ended up with Ryan's death,\" said Ms Lambe. \"Had Clive not intervened, we could have seriously ended up with Ryan being executed and he was never even near the scene of the crime.\" </p> <p>Ms Lane Fox said: \"Since the reintroduction of the death penalty in the United States 115 people have been exonerated from death row. 115 times the jury got it wrong and 115 people could now be dead. Ryan's case epitomises why we must never give up the fight against the death penalty.\" </p> <p>Next month, the US supreme court will consider whether it is constitutional to execute people for crimes committed when they were 16 or 17 years old. The US is one of a few countries in the world that executes juveniles. </p> <p>Mr Matthews' American lawyer, Billy Sothern, said his exoneration was timely. \"Ryan's case has the capacity to change the dialogue, showing that juveniles are incredibly vulnerable to being convicted and sentenced to death.\" </p> <p>His mother, Pauline, who travelled to London to give a talk on her son's case last year, said: \"The heavens opened up when those British people came to Ryan's aid. When they got there, the whole scene in the courtroom was different. Ryan's lawyer had never talked to him or me about his defence, they wanted him to plead guilty but he said he wouldn't plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit. </p> <p>\"The people in the UK don't believe in the death penalty and they were really concerned that Ryan was a child and that here in America we are killing our children.\" </p> <p>Mr Matthews told the Guardian: \"It felt pretty good when I was released.

  "New rules to make it more difficult for schools and local authorities to sell their playing fields were announced by the government yesterday, in an attempt to stem criticism that Labour has broken a key manifesto pledge to restrict sales. <p>The Department for Education and Skills has joined forces with the National Playing Fields Association - one of its strongest critics in the past - to stress that getting rid of open areas for children's sport must be \"an absolute last resort\". </p> <p>Labour toughened up the law to restrict such sales in 1998 - a year after it came into power - but there are claims that it has nodded through applications in the past five years. Under the new rules - which apply to England only - local authorities will have to prove that they have exhausted all other options before agreeing a sale, the proceeds will have to go towards improved outdoor facilities and those facilities will have to be sustainable for at least ten years. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills said disposals of school playing fields had reduced \"dramatically\" since 1998 with only 17 applications last year, of which just nine were approved. Surprisingly, there are no accurate figures for the situationbefore 1998. </p> <p>The government remains highly sensitive about the issue, with school sport moving up the political agenda amid debate about sporting prowess during the Olympics and as ministers acknowledges that it is critical for tackling obesity. Earlier this week it was suggested by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, that new plans to increase competitive sport will be included in Labour's general election manifesto. </p> <p>Announcing the new rules at Langdon Community school in Newham, east London, education secretary Charles Clarke said: \"The old phrase 'healthy body, healthy minds' is true.\" He went on: \"School playing fields will now not only be protected but also improved for the benefit of pupils and the wider community. It should also challenge the misconception that school playing fields have been sold off indiscriminately.\" </p> <p>But critics fear that ministers are sending out mixed messages on the issue. Earlier this month the sports minister, Richard Caborn, launched adefence of the selling-off of playing fields under Labour. He said the government's investment was not in \"soggy playing fields\" but in state-of-the-art artificial pitches. </p> <p>Elsa Davies, outgoing director of the NPFA, said: \"On my last day in post, it warms my heart to know that in future school playing fields will only be lost in the most extreme circumstances and even when this happens, the income will be used to improve outdoor play and sports facilities.</p>",
  "<p>The number of abortions in England and Wales rose to a record 181,600 last year, raising doubts about the effectiveness of the government's strategy for improving contraceptive services. </p> <p>Figures from the Department of Health showed the abortion rate increased in every age group during the childbearing years, including the under-16s. </p> <p>There were 17.5 abortions per 1,000 women residents of England and Wales aged 15 to 44. This was 3.2% more than in 2002 when the rate declined slightly. </p> <p>The rate was highest among women aged 20 to 24. They had 51,124 terminations - an abortion rate of 31.4 per 1,000. There was also a high number of teenage abortions. A total of 37,043 terminations took place among girls aged 15 to 19, higher than the 36,018 recorded for the 25 to 29 age group. The under-16 abortion rate rose from 3.7 to 3.9 per 1,000. </p> <p>Three-quarters of the abortions were carried out on single women. There were also 9,100 pregnancies terminated among visiting non-residents in England and Wales, mostly from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. </p> <p>The Department of Health acknowledged: \"The figures are disappointing. However, no contraception method is 100% effective and there will always be women seeking an abortion as they are legally entitled to do. </p> <p>\"A key aim of the government's sexual health and HIV strategy, and the teenage pregnancy strategy, is to reduce unintended pregnancy rates. Provision of good contraceptive services is key in achieving this.\" But the department was unable to explain why the abortion rate was rising when contraception services were supposed to be improving. </p> <p>Anne Weyman, the chief executive of FPA (formerly the Family Planning Association) said: \"It is good news that more abortions are taking place under 10 weeks and that there are higher rates of medical abortion. It is encouraging to see access to abortion speeded up and women being given a choice of methods. </p> <p>\"But again we see more figures exposing the desperate need for investment in NHS contraceptive services, including support for the professionals trying to run them. </p> <p>\"Access to good-quality, widely available services is essential in preventing unplanned pregnancies. However, despite saving the NHS an estimated \u00a32.5bn a year, contraception is still treated as the Cinderella service of public health. </p> <p>Ann Furedi, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, Britain's largest abortion provider, said: \"We don't see abortion as a problem, we see abortion as a solution to the problem of unwanted pregnancy for many. </p> <p>\"It may very well be that an increase in abortion rate represents the fact that more women feel that it's acceptable to take control of their lives by ending pregnancies that weren't planned.\" </p> <p>The department's statistical report showed that four-fifths of abortions were funded by the NHS - half in NHS clinics and half in the independent sector under NHS contract. </p> <p>The proportion carried out medically - using pills instead of surgical procedures - rose from 14% to 17%. </p> <p>There were 1,950 abortions performed because of a risk the child would be born handicapped - about 1% of the total. About 87% were carried out under 13 weeks gestation and 58% under 10 weeks. </p> <p>The department withheld much of the information that was released in previous annual reports on abortion, including data on abortions over 24 weeks gestation and the medical conditions involved in abortions performed due to foetal abnormality. </p> <p>This included controversial material that may have contributed to legal action by Joanna Jepson, a Church of England curate, to challenge a decision by police not to prosecute doctors who carried out an abortion on a foetus with a cleft lip and palate. </p> <p>Julia Millington of the ProLife party said: \"We reiterate our concerns over the very high numbers of abortions in 2003 ... We are extremely concerned that the government has deliberately omitted the breakdown of medical conditions allowing abortion for foetal abnormality.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Drug-taking among 11 to 15 year olds increased slightly last year, rising from 20% to 21% of the age group. About 8% of 11-year-olds used drugs in 2003, compared with 38% of 15-year-olds. Cannabis was the most frequently reported illicit drug, but 1% of young people used heroin and 1% cocaine.</p>",
  "<p>Making lists concentrates the mind, particularly if it's a list involving something enjoyable. Gardening and horticulture lend themselves admirably to the art - lists of seasonal vegetables to grow, flowers to plant for autumn colour, climbers that are scented, shrubs that need no pruning ... the possibilities are endless. </p> <p>My own gardening lists involve looking back over a thousand years, and charting the arrival dates of the foreign plants we have domesticated in our gardens and where in the world they came from. </p> <p>The story behind the appearance of new flora in Britain often relates to historical events. For example, if you examine plant arrivals from one specific part of the world over a 10-year period, you can be sure that some sort of exploration, or exploitation, was going on. It's an obsessional interest that gains in fascination and sometimes frustration. Why do we call the California poppy Eschscholzia californica? The latter word is obvious, but the first is difficult both to say and spell. This bright orange annual first arrived in Europe in 1790, probably via Spain, when it was called copa de ora, \"cup of gold\". Its botanical name came later and is in honour of Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz, an Estonian doctor who sailed on board the Russian vessel Rurik for three years from 1815, circumnavigating the world. Both the ship's captain, Otto von Kotzebue, and its botanist, Adelbert Chamisso, already had ports named after them in the Bering Strait. So, returning to Russia with some seeds, Chamisso decided to name the poppy after the doctor. </p> <p>Because of Britain's ancient geological past, including the inundation and separation from the continent into an island, our native flora (a mere 200 species) has never reflected our ambitions as a gardening nation. However, our small offshore island was peculiarly situated, with a relatively equable climate, enabling us to become the horticultural obsessives we are today. We now grow one of the greatest range of plants, not only in our gardens but in our countryside as well. </p> <p>Knowing where plants came from and when they entered Britain has totally altered my historical and gardening perceptions. What I grow and plant in the garden is dominated by both those themes. </p> <p>My husband (the real gardener in the partnership) and I are creating a garden in Brittany, adjacent to the Nantes-Brest canal. When we arrived four years ago, it was a cow-filled pasture with no mature trees. Now, gradually, the space is turning into a garden, always led by our passion to grow something with a fascinating background. With a brand new garden, I was determined to cultivate one of the earliest recorded and most holy of plants, the Madonna lily, Lilium candidum. Probably brought to Britain by the Romans, its association with the Virgin Mary was so powerful that almost all the early paintings of the Annunciation depict the flower. We have enjoyed it for more than a thousand years in our gardens - so long that its true home has been all but forgotten, though Turkey and the near east seem most likely. </p> <p>A shrub growing close by, but separated by more than a millennium, is the Chinese allspice Sinocalycanthus chinensis, with its glorious cup-shaped white and maroon flower. It was brought into cultivation by the redoubtable Roy Lancaster after one of his expeditions to China in the late 20th century. </p> <p>We are fortunate to have the space to plant some favourite trees, all of them having caught our historical imagination in one way or the other. One is the birch, Betula utilis var. jacquemontii, brought to Britain some time during the 1880s and named after a French traveller, Victor Jacquemont. He was a botanist renowned for his charm and impeccable manners who, as a young man, travelled in some style in the Himalayas, making a collection of the flora and fauna for the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris. The elegant white-limbed birch somehow reflects and reminds us of his easy sophistication. </p> <p>Another tree I enjoy growing for its historic associations is Liriodendron tulipifera (the tulip tree), a 17th-century American introduction by John Tradescant the Younger (1608-62) who collected it on one of his trips to Virginia. Though this tree flowers rarely, the shape of the leaf - like a webbed foot - makes it instantly recognisable. In those pioneering days in America, the tree was a giant, growing straight and true up to 190ft; the wood was hewn by explorers to makes canoes, or the timber (known as white wood) used for cupboards, shelves and furniture. Tradescant (a great list-maker, too) was a lover of trees, and when writing his book, Sylva: A Discourse Of Forest Trees, in 1664, said he \"wished we had more of them\". </p> <p>A second Tradescant plant that flourishes here in Brittany is angelica (Angelica archangelica), which was collected a generation earlier from Russia by Tradescant's father. The botanical duo were successive gardeners to Charles I and were adventurous in the collecting and growing of plants. </p> <p>A plant we enjoy growing for its associations is camas, or bear grass - a bulbous perennial, not a grass. It has lovely upright flowering stems in pink, white or blue. Called Camassia quamash, the flower is a native of America and Canada, and both its Latin names recall its origins from the Nootka Chinook tribe of Native Americans. It was collected in 1827 by David Douglas, the Scottish collector and explorer, who is mainly remembered for the myriad pines and firs he introduced to Britain. </p> <p>The camassia is one of those small band of plants that lead a dual life, looking equally at home in the flowerbed and vegetable patch. It was part of the Chinook diet and was full of starch (Douglas thought it tasted like baked pears) with the usual side effect that starchy vegetables (such as the artichoke) create: flatulence. Sharing a lodge one night with his Chinook friends, Douglas recorded that he was almost blown out of his sleeping quarters \"by the strength of the wind\". </p> <p>Choosing plants because of their historical associations has given me a new perspective on gardening. I feel as if I have entered into a secret history where the unravelling of plant names, the stories they carry and the places they came from transforms a garden into a kind of international community. Every single plant, wild or cultivated, has a history longer than our own. Wherever we grow them - on a roundabout, by a motorway service station, in a windowbox - their story is as much one of migration and adaptation as any human one. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Origin Of Plants, by Maggie Campbell-Culver, is published by Eden Project Books at \u00a39.99.</p>",
  "Everyone has a type. Line up your exes and look for the ilk. Most of mine had been empathetically void record-shop boys. Muddled minds filled with books, booze and rare imports. They suited me. They always had. <p>But then things changed, and my evasive \"type\" stopped being quite right. Suddenly, pragmatism yelled for someone who'd yank their messy head out of the sand and deal with the acrid truth. </p> <p>I've got a progressive eye disease that is slowly rotting away my retinas. I'm already partially deaf, though that's never bothered me. I liked it. It's all I've ever known, and you can't miss what you never had. But 10 years ago I saw a doctor who made a shattering diagnosis: retinitis pigmentosa. My perfect vision was only on loan and blindness was the likely outcome. He couldn't say when, but assured me it would come. It didn't feel like part of me. It still doesn't. But it is. </p> <p>For years my pale eyes lingered on as normal, but lurking in the background was the harsh and certain promise of my future. I tried to ignore it, dating a succession of ostrich types who helped me avoid what was ahead. Then, several years ago, sight loss caught up with me. I saw less, and fell more. The peripheries of my vision vanished. It hurt. </p> <p>Around about the same time, I was seeing a lanky musician with the most beautiful face I had ever encountered. I adored him. I used to lie awake at night just to capture his sleeping image and consign it to the archive of my mind. I like collecting faces. I do it on escalators and on the tube. I know there'll be a time when looks will matter less. But I'll still want to remember. </p> <p>I believed we'd grow old together. But we won't. Some things last and some things don't. I think he thought if we didn't talk about it, the eye rot would stop. His nonchalance brought a sense of unnecessary shame to my situation. I wanted someone to say it was all going to be OK and that I'd still be loved. He didn't. </p> <p>Instead he left. I felt cross. After years of monogamy, I'd forgotten how to date. When I met him, I could see fine. When he went, I couldn't. I had stuff to learn. Like how do you make eye contact across the bar when you can't see in the dark? And what happens when you go on a date with a man who turns out to be a total no-no, but you still have to hold his hand because you can't see where you are going otherwise. </p> <p>My friends said it was time to try a new genre of man. Someone with rubbish records - \"a sensible bloke, mature and dependable\", they said. </p> <p>They took it upon themselves to line up a succession of suitable types. They were after someone who would \"take good care of me\" and wheeled out their scraggly mates who had been on the reserve bench for years. None of them was ever going to click. </p> <p>There was \"a guy from work\" who liked \"meeting new people\", someone's shy brother, and the best (but not by much) - someone's \"down to earth mate from school\". I looked at him from different angles and squinted a bit in an attempt to excavate a latent spark. It wasn't there. He was so down to earth he was practically licking the floor. He just wasn't my type. I still held his hand, though. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A new column by Rebecca Atkinson will start in Weekend on September 11.</p>",
  "OK, I did sleep with this guy but only once, so it doesn't really count, does it? Anyway, I'm treating you to this tale because I reckon you deserve one in which I'm the twat. Also, the episode spawned a catchphrase between my sister and myself that encapsulates the particular type of humiliation I subjected myself to. <p>So I meet this bloke. He's cute and funny. We have sex. Since he doesn't chew his arm off at the shoulder in the morning rather than awaken the sleeping me nestled in his embrace, I think that it is safe to assume he likes me. We part company and agree to call each other. But he doesn't. </p> <p>I then do what anyone not in receipt of postcoital contact senses in their very sphincter they shouldn't do. I call him. And, as you would expect, this turns out to be a super-duper idea. </p> <p>His flatmate answers the phone and says he'll get him. I wait. And wait. Eventually, I detect heated whispers in the background. He is urging his flatmate to tell me that he must have been mistaken and he isn't in. </p> <p>I am poleaxed with inert embarrassment. Do I hang up or strangle myself with the cord? Too late. He picks up the phone and is monosyllabic. I make some pathetic excuse and slam the receiver down as if it had burst into flames. </p> <p>Thereafter my sister dubbed this experience 'hot telephone' - pretty apt. I certainly got burned by that one.</p>",
  "When I moved to New York a few years ago, I despaired of ever seeing a decent straight male body again. Except in the privacy of my own boudoir. It's not that New York men don't work out - they're always at the gym. But I had been living in Italy for eight years, and there the men dress in a way that would instantly characterise them as gay if they came to New York. The dress code for American straight men is entirely built around Not Looking Homosexual. Their trousers hang off their bottoms and their extra-large T-shirts balloon around their pecs. You rarely have any idea what an American man's body is like until you get his clothes off. It's like playing Pass The Parcel - you keep unwrapping and cross your fingers that you're going to get something good at the end of it. <p>Right now I'm back in Italy, visiting friends, and my American boyfriend Greg has just joined me. Greg is a super-smart dresser who turned out, once unwrapped, to have a very nice figure. He wears agn\u00e8s b, Ted Baker and Thomas Pink. He has three earrings, a neogoth haircut and a pierced nipple. Not your typical Gap-khaki-shirt-and-chinos American man. Yet even he has been freaking for weeks about what clothes to bring to Italy, nervous that he wouldn't fit in with my Italian male friends. He was so determined not to be the \"ugly American abroad\" that he even sent me links to websites, showing shirts he was thinking of buying so I could give the imperial thumbs up or down. I had been torturing him by saying meditatively, \"Well, of course, when you get to Italy we're going to have to get you some capri trousers\", or \"I can't believe you don't have a decent pair of man-sandals.\" </p> <p>And perhaps it was overegging the pudding to have bought him a man-bag in the market the day before he arrived - a black canvas pouch on a webbing strap, to be slung across the chest. I was shopping with my friend Tommaso, a macho fisherman who built his own boat and has 17 toolboxes in the back of his Jeep. In America, a man like Tommaso would wear gigantic check shirts and baseball caps. However, being Italian, he pounced on the man-bags with the same excitement girls show on finding the perfect handbag: \"Oh, Madonna, I've been looking for one like this for years! Look, it has a pocket for my cellphone, and a little one for my Vespa keys ... it's perfect .\" </p> <p>Greg, on the other hand, regarded the man-bag with barely concealed horror. He had bought me a lovely aquamarine necklace and clearly considered that I was playing some terrible joke on him by offering a thinly disguised bum bag in exchange. When he eventually put it on, he stood looking at me with the sad eyes of a beaten dog, mutely imploring me to tell him to take it off. </p> <p>\"It looks wonderful!\" I said briskly, pretending not to notice that his lower lip was trembling. \"Just tighten it across your chest more.\" </p> <p>We went to Florence today, and I couldn't help noticing that he kept trying to hide the pouch part under his arm. Even for Greg, the man-bag was clearly One Step Too Far. Because Greg has grown up in America, where straight male dressing is all about not standing out from the crowd, and certainly not about tightening the webbing strap of your man-bag across your snug T-shirt so it throws the pec muscle thus revealed into even sharper relief. Americans shop at Gap because Gap clothes are guaranteed to be socially acceptable, neutral and dull. American men would cut off their willies rather than dress in a way that proclaims their sexuality, that shouts, \"Look at me, girls! Aren't I the hottest thing you ever saw?\" </p> <p>Italian men, on the other hand, present themselves as sex objects. When they shoot burning glances at women they pass in the street, they want an acknowledgment in return that they, too, are looking damned good in their hot top and tight jeans. An Italian size XL is equivalent to an American M. </p> <p>And perhaps to an English L. English guys tend to be halfway between these two extremes. They want to be desired for their bodies, they want to look trendy and, like Greg, they love their Ted Baker and Thomas Pink. David Beckham, bless his diamond earrings and sarongs, is the metrosexual role model for the young Englishman who wants to dress as sexy as the Italians. </p> <p>But I can't imagine even Becks putting on a pair of white stretchy harem trousers falling just below the knee, which was my friend Maurizio's principal item of clothing last weekend by the Tuscan seaside. A programme like Queer Eye For The Straight Guy wouldn't have a hope of getting off the ground in Italy, though it would be a nice holiday for the Fab Five. I can just imagine them sitting around drinking Campari sodas with their Italian straight target while he criticises their trousers for being too loose and gets them into the skintight red T-shirts bearing the legend \"Porn Star\" that all young Italian males are wearing this season. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Greg is progressing by leaps and bounds. I have already bought him a pale fuchsia cloth belt and a white linen shirt. He tried on some man-sandals, and he was actually disappointed when the shop didn't have the combat-pocketed capris he liked in his size. He's even wearing the man-bag with increasing confidence, though he has one proviso. </p> <p>He absolutely refuses to wear it in New York. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Judy Rumbold is away.</p>",
  "<p>Hallo! Splendid to be with you again for another occasional column that abandons the faux weariness and fashionable cynicism of other commentators in favour of an awe at the rich diversity of Life, best captured by that admiring shake of the head that tends to accompany the whispered, \"Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs!\" </p> <p>Let me give you a couple of \"for instances\". Dentists and front gardens. Some will have greeted another report about dentists refusing to take new NHS patients with a snort of \"Them! Again!\" Others will have contemplated with ill-concealed impatience an appeal for householders to stop converting their front gardens into concrete parking spaces because of the danger of flash floods, clearly recalling the same story last year and even, in extreme cases, considering the threat somewhat exaggerated. </p> <p>Not me. Just follow my way, and I think you'll find excitement where there was ennui, inspiration where there was irritation. Dentists first. They get a terrible press, don't they? And not surprisingly, given all those etched memories of what happened after that first, beguilingly even-toned and casually conversational \"Open wide for me, please\". </p> <p>It goes beyond revenge for that and their remorseless one-sided discussions about golf. It's about power, control, trust and the confident reposing of same. It is, in short, an image thing, and my way - the positive, empowering way, rather than the negative, sneery way - is to help. Look at what I've already done for librarians, for example: as a result of my efforts, many people are now aware that Casanova was a librarian. And Anthea Turner. And Chairman Mao. I have also pointed out that quite a few librarians ride big motorcycles. </p> <p>Getting the idea? Change perceptions by publicising stimulating role models. Take the dentist in film. I know what you're thinking: Olivier and Hoffman in Marathon Man. Don't. Think, instead, of that Scandinavian classic, Tandl\u00e6ge P\u00e5 Sengekanten. You must remember it. Danish Dentist On The Job, it was called over here. There. Easy. Dr Crippen practised a bit of dentistry? So let's concentrate on another famous and rather more appealing dentist who ran into the occasional legal problem, John \"Doc\" Holliday, Wyatt Earp's compadre. </p> <p>I am here indebted to a biography of Doc by Dr Frank Heynick, a fellow dentist who has also written for Angle Orthodontist. Dr Heynick gives praise where it is due: \"At his first practice in Dallas he shared top prize in several categories of dental craftsmanship at the annual North Texas Fair.\" But he points out that Doc's tuberculosis could be a drawback: \"John's persistent coughing made patients shy away from him.\" </p> <p>He does, though, have a stirring conclusion: \"To this day there is much disagreement about how many men Doc in fact mortally wounded. Serious estimates range from just the one at the OK Corral to around 16. It is fair to say, in any case, that John Henry Holliday was a dentist who knew how to drill a man in more ways than one.\" Excellent, doctor, just what we're after. </p> <p>Already seeing the figure in white with the little mirror thingy just a bit differently? Noting the easy way with the amalgam, a certain bravura in the clipped command to rinse? NHS recruits will flood in, especially after a visit to the International Hall of Fame of Dentistry at the Samuel D Harris Museum of Dentistry in Baltimore, which features this citation for Dr GV Black of Chicago: \"He is known to all of us as 'The Grand Old Man of Dentistry'. Who could ask for anything more?\" Marvellous, although I'm surprised there's no room for Wilf Rosenberg, the legendary Leeds rugby league winger known as \"The Flying Dentist\". Mao, by the way, was a bit of a dab hand at tennis. But, pausing only to pass on advice for dealing with wasps from Dr Norman Carreck, entomologist - \"If you do try to swat it, be sure not to miss\" - I must get on with this front garden business. I think we can agree the front garden is a Good Thing - floral delight, subtle personal space delineator, flash flood barrier - but I think we can also agree that, with a dash of concrete, it does also make a jolly good parking space. </p> <p>Right. For me, a problem is just a solution waiting to happen. Why can't we combine attractive water-retaining garden with concrete parking opportunity? Not enough space? Imagination, use it, please! What about giant hanging baskets? Give the gnomes bigger wheelbarrows! What about a car-cleaning gnome in overalls holding a really big sponge? Narrow but very deep moats? Wider public: when using this space to dispose of lager cans, always remember to place with drinking end upright. Thank you.

  "Russian investigators have finally admitted that terrorists were almost certainly responsible for the destruction of the two passenger planes which crashed on Tuesday, five days before the Chechen presidential election. <p>Traces of explosives have been found in one of the wrecks and a website linked to Islamist militants has claimed that the action was connected to Russia's war on the Chechen separatists. </p> <p>After two days in which the authorities were criticised for dismissing the possibility of terrorist involvement in the crashes, the Federal Security Service (FSB) admitted: \"During an investigation of the remains of the Tu-154 plane, traces of explosives were found.\" </p> <p>The plane came down near Rostov on Don, killing everyone on board. </p> <p>The admission was made a few hours after a little-known Islamist group claimed responsibility for the crashes, which happened within minutes of each other to two flights from Moscow, and killed a total of 89 people. </p> <p>The site said: \"Our mujahideen in the Islambouli Brigades were able to hijack two Russian planes and they were successful, despite the obstacles that faced them at the beginning.\" </p> <p>It added that the attack was \"aimed at helping our Muslim brothers in Chechnya and other Muslim countries enduring Russia's atheism.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow Chechnya is due to elect a new president to succeed Akhmad Kadyrov, who was killed in a bombing during May Day celebrations in the Chechen capital, Grozny. </p> <p>Responsibility for the two crashes is being placed at two women of Chechen origin on the passenger lists, one in each plane. </p> <p>The Islambouli Brigades' statement claimed that there were five terrorists on each plane, but the investigation is concentrating on two names: S Dzhebirkhanova and Amanta Nagayeva. </p> <p>No relatives of the women have come forward in connection with their deaths in the crashes. </p> <p>There are conflicting reports that only parts of their bodies were found in the wreckage, possibly suggesting that they had been at the centre of explosions. </p> <p>Chechen rebels have often tried to time their attacks to coincide with significant events, and the FSB said that the explosive found at the crash site - hexogen - was a type often used by Chechen terrorists. </p> <p>It was used in the series of bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and Volgodonsk in 1999, blamed on Chechen rebels, which killed more than 300 people; and in last year's suicide bombings in Moscow, at a rock concert and a hotel near the Kremlin. </p> <p>An FSB spokeswoman said: \"The investigation process produced information which has allowed us to identify a number of people with possible links to the terrorist act that was committed on the Tu-154.\" </p> <p>Within a day of the crashes the FSB said that no traces of explosives had been found in the wreckage of the planes. </p> <p>The Russian media has heavily criticised the government for rebutting the theory of a terrorist attack; it has been alleged that the Kremlin did not want to blame terrorists until after the election. </p> <p>Other new details about the crashes underline the likelihood that they were the result of a terrorist attack. </p> <p>The pilot of the Tu-154, flying to Sochi, sent a hijack alarm signal three times, an air traffic controller in the area where the plane crashed told the Itar-Tass news agency. </p> <p>Another source told the agency that two signals were given. </p> <p>There are varying reports that an alarm signal was sent from the other plane, the Tu-134, flying to Volgograd, which crashed within a few minutes of the first plane. </p> <p>Interfax reported Victor Ilyu khin, a member of the Russian duma's (parliament) security committee, as saying that the fact that neither planes' crew managed to speak to air traffic control before crashing showed that there \"was either an explosion or the pilots were shot\". </p> <p>Examination of the wreckage in both cases pointed to explosions at the back of the planes, close to or in the toilets, according to a report given to the president's envoy in the south, Vladimir Yakovlev, the website gazeta.ru reported.</p>",

Officially, life is getting better. </p> <p>Yet when Chechnya is asked tomorrow to vote for a replacement to President Akhmad Kadyrov, assassinated in May, the Kremlin will be hard put to claim that things are \"returning to normal\". Perhaps President Putin himself recognised the doublespeak when he remarked on a visit in May that the capital, Grozny, a city blasted by two Russian onslaughts, looked awful from a helicopter, and demanded that repairs be expedited. </p> <p>The city yesterday seemed more under siege than in the throes of an election. Parents collected their children from intensive care, thinking they would be safer at home than in hospital over the election. Troops and police blocked off roads. A market trader said a young man in the traditional separatist camouflage told her: \"Get out of here by 2pm, or we won't be responsible for what happens to you.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow, Chechnya will be asked to vote in Alu Alkhanov, the Chechen interior minister. When President Kadyrov was killed in a supposedly separatist bomb blast, Mr Putin mourned, yet insisted it was no setback to his policy of handing control of the war-torn republic over to pro-Moscow Chechens. He forwarded Mr Alkhanov as Mr Kadyrov's replacement. He will be the second president of Chechnya in a year and a man the separatist movement had pledged to kill. </p> <p>Few believe that Mr Alkhanov, chosen for little other than his ties to Mr Kadyrov's ruling clan, can prevent a slide into another chaotic war. The pro-Moscow Chechen security forces Mr Kadyrov created are also bickering now that they no longer have the late president's thuggish yet respected personality to bind them together. </p> <p>This private army, known as the Kadyrovtsi, is run by his son, Ramzan, and three senior commanders. Ramzan has reportedly fallen out with the most senior of these, Movladi Baisarov. He accused Mr Baisarov of withholding some of the country's lucrative oil revenue from him. </p> <p>Last Saturday night the separatist militants, a force Moscow discounts as demoralised, took over parts of Grozny and then disappeared into the night. Some accounts suggest up to 400 militants launched a coordinated attack, one police officer telling the Guardian that 58 police were killed, together with more than a dozen civilian bystanders. </p> <p>Across town, Ruslan, a police captain guarding polling station 412 with 10 men, said he came under attack at 10pm from \"60 militants\". Two of his men died before their attackers fled. </p> <p>The renewed militant offensive served to highlight the growing animosity between the two forces charged by the Kremlin with protecting the republic - Chechen troops who had fought against the Russians in the first Chechen war and Russian troops. Two attacks occurred within 100 metres of the Russian military air base, Khankala, yet the Russians did not intervene. The police captain even claimed: \"The federals let [the militants] through their checkpoints. No militant gets anywhere without their clearance\". All the same, Moscow played the incident down, a military spokesman saying only that 50 rebels had been killed. </p> <p>Yesterday, fears were rising that the Kremlin - after a blast on the Moscow metro, a presidential assassination and the downing of two passenger airliners in six months alone - would make a third, and purportedly final, show of force over Chechnya. A nervous police captain insisted: \"Terrorist acts aren't prepared here. We'll be fine. It's just Chechens in Moscow who will be heavily filtered.\" </p> <p>Yet whether Mr Putin responds by giving the extremists in the Russian army another chance to achieve a final victory over the Islamic extremists among the militants, Tuta Batayeva's eyes will probably still be red with despair. </p> <p>Militants fleeing one checkpoint on Saturday shot her son Isa, 43, dead outside their home, apparently mistaking him for a policeman. After showing how the bullet went through her son, then her garden gate, kitchen door and her fridge, she said: \"We don't know who is good or bad any more. They all look the same and nobody protects us. And whoever you vote for, they still ensure the killing goes on.\"</p>",
  "<p>I was not making any great protest by abandoning television five years ago. I moved house, my old telly wouldn't work and I put off getting a new one until the builders had moved out. That took three months and I realised that I hadn't missed it, so I just never got around to buying another one. </p> <p>That gives me a unique perspective. I have watched a lot of television in the past few months - and it has changed a lot in five years. </p> <p>First, let me dispel a myth that pops up as regularly as the weather forecast: there's nothing worth watching these days. It's rubbish. The quality of the best television is not just as good as it ever was. It is even better. </p> <p>But ... there's the rest of it. A vast amount is simply mediocre. One of the most senior executives in the business described it to me as carbohydrate television. You watch it (\"consume\" might be better) because it's there. After an hour or two you feel as if you've wasted your time, but what the hell. It probably hasn't done you much harm and if it leaves you feeling a bit bloated ... well, you can search out a bit of quality stuff - a bit of protein to go with the carbohydrate. </p> <p>We all know why there is so much of it. Michael Grade has talked about the \"market-driven drift towards programme-making as a commodity\". This wouldn't matter if all this stuff were cheap, but it costs money, and that's money that can't be spent on decent programmes. The fashionable defence of it is to say that it is \"no-brow\" television: not high-brow, not low-brow - just no-brow. It is no-brow because it is no content, no nourishment, no good. </p> <p>There is, of course, another defence against this kind of television. It's the Blue Planet defence: \"Yes there's some lousy television around, but what about The Blue Planet? What about Walking With Dinosaurs...?\" Well, you might - just - get away with that. But it is not a defence against bad television. </p> <p>The first principle of the Hippocratic oath, which doctors have been swearing for 2,500 years, is \"Do no harm\". It's not a bad principle for broadcasters. The good television of today is better than the best television of the old days. The bad television is worse. It is not only bad, it is damaging. Meretricious. Seedy. Cynical. </p> <p>Good television does not balance the bad. Not if it coarsens and brutalises and turns us into voyeurs. The good cannot pay the dues of the bad when the bad is indefensible. And some of our worst television is indefensible. It does harm. </p> <p>I was shocked by some of what I saw when I came out of my Rip Van Winkle state. So much of it seemed not just vulgar and obsessed with sex, but altogether more confrontational than I'd remembered. The violence of the language surprised me. It seemed almost impossible to switch on without encountering some sort of aggression, even in the soaps. </p> <p>So that's one big change, but it's been an incremental one. There has been another, seminal, change that made this Rip Van Winkle wonder if he had woken from his long sleep not just in another time, but in another place. It is, of course, so-called reality television. </p> <p>Reality implies authenticity and honesty. And whatever some of this stuff may be, it is not authentic and it is not honest. This is not just bad television in the sense that it's mediocre, pointless, puerile even. It's bad because it is damaging. Remember: first, do no harm. </p> <p>The influence of reality programmes has been out of all proportion to their number. They have infected the mainstream of the medium. History is one small example - now it has to be \"living\" history. Commissioning editors have less of the schedule to play with; they become risk-averse. Originality suffers. </p> <p>Then there is the cult of celebrity, which fosters values that are utterly shallow and kill real ambition. We tell kids what matters is being a celebrity and we wonder why some behave the way they do. And what about the \"lucky\" ones, the ones who make it into the house, on to the screen? Most survive unscathed - so far as we know. But then, we would not know if they were damaged, would we, because we lose interest once they are no longer \"famous\". BB5, we were told, would \"get evil\". The house would be made more claustrophobic to \"prompt the explosion of any tensions\". And when the explosions duly happened, what are we told? \"The welfare of the housemates is always our overriding concern\". Note the \"always\". Do I need to join the dots? </p> <p>In society as a whole, reality television erodes the distinction between the public and the private, which is a profoundly important aspect of our culture. Much more worrying is its coarsening effect. It turns human beings into freaks for us to gawp at. And don't tell me it's just entertainment. You can't use people with real lives and real problems and real children as \"just entertainment\". Well, you can, but it's corrupting. The first time I watched Big Brother live there were two men lying on beds and talking about women. Or rather \"fucking women\". And talking about their responses to them. Or, rather, \"my fucking stiffy\". My, how we've pushed back the boundaries of television. How proud we should be. </p> <p>Let me give you a quote: \"To apply broadcasting to the dissemination of the shoddy, the vulgar and the sensational would be a blasphemy against human nature.\" That was Lord Reith. But what did he know? Patronising old toff. </p> <p>You may ask why I'm attacking reality TV when it's in its death throes. Well, because it's not. What happened when Big Brother ratings were down last year? The ratchet effect took over. We had to be shocked that bit more. That's what always happens when ratings are the only measure. And ratchets work only one way. Even when this genre exhausts itself, it will leave behind an audience that has been desensitised. The ratchet has been at work. </p> <p>There has always been a clash between freedom, especially freedom of expression, and the conservative wish to preserve values. In the 60s, Mary Whitehouse was taken apart by the liberal elite, who defended Lady Chatterley and the Oz publishers, arguing - in my view rightly - that it was not just censorious but stupid to pretend that sex happened only in the marital bed. This was a genuine debate between different views of what was good for society. </p> <p>What's happening now is different. This is a battle between people who are concerned about society and those whose interest is simply to make programmes that make money. Those who fought for the word fuck in Lady Chatterley didn't do it to make money. Now the cash registers go ker-ching every time there's a fumble beneath the bed sheets. </p> <p>In the bad old days we had paternalists trying to capture the masses for what they believed in their patrician way to be good. Now we have businessmen calculating how much they can get away with to titillate or to outrage the masses and deliver the profits. Which is worse? </p> <p>Some of the people who bring us junk TV admit there may be something in what I'm saying. They have a defence: the free market. \"Sorry,\" they say, \"it's out of our hands.\" This brings us to the heart of it. What can people who are worried do about a television market that is increasingly open and free from regulation? </p> <p>If we tried to limit the harm, it would not amount to censorship. People who want the stuff that I find offensive can always get it if they're prepared to pay. Let them. The question for us is: do we want to keep part of the television world within the boundaries of regulation? </p> <p>Ofcom is examining its regulatory role in relation to public service broadcasting. It will soon be coming out with the second stage of its conclusions. It is interested in what it calls the \"citizen rationale\" for regulation: that is \"to secure wider social benefits\". </p> <p>Economists talk about \"merit goods\" - a useful concept to apply to television. Public service broadcasters must provide goods that individuals and advertisers are not prepared to pay for. I'd like to suggest to Ofcom that there is an obverse of merit goods: debit goods. Just as it intervenes to make sure that merit goods are provided on terrestrial channels, it should intervene to prevent the supply of debit goods. It may, indeed, be moving in that direction. It's planning to remove prescriptions on taste and decency and replace them with guidelines on harm and offence. Much better. </p> <p>Some say Ofcom may not have the power to muck about with its regulatory framework. Well, parliament should give it that power. It's also for parliament to decide if terrestrial commercial channels need special protection in return for a more committed public-service approach that avoids harm. </p> <p>The BBC's responsibilities in this brave new world are greater than ever. It has recently rediscovered the value of genuine public service broadcasting, or so we are told. Some cynical souls make a connection between that and charter renewal.If that's true, so what? That's what the charter process is for, isn't it? </p> <p>The BBC has avoided the excesses of reality television. But what of that other vital aspect of public service broadcasting: news - the most important thing we do. By a mile. If we get it wrong, we forfeit the right to exist. </p> <p>We are living in what everyone seems to call the post-Hutton era. If this means we should make ever greater efforts to get things right, that's fine - but we've always tried to do that. But it seems to imply that our political journalism needs somehow to be different. This is the bit that worries me. </p> <p>It's usually linked to the idea that people have lost interest in politics and that's somehow our fault. Certainly fewer people bother to vote, but we've had 12 years of economic growth. In a culture where getting and spending is the big preoccupation, it's hardly surprising they're a bit apathetic. But if we do have some responsibility for apathy, what might it be? </p> <p>It was Greg Dyke's view that we hadn't faced up to the fact that politics is boring and it's our job to make it less boring. If that's true, how come so many people were voting when Brian Walden was supposedly boring the pants off us on Weekend World, and there were other political programmes that were just as analytical, just as (in the Dyke view) boring. </p> <p>Even if it were true, it's not our job to make it fun. It's a serious business and it's our job to report it seriously. We shouldn't be trying to lure people into politics by pretending that it's just another game show. Greg got it wrong. </p> <p>But there's a more serious charge: that our own cynical approach has turned people off politics. This is the thesis of John Lloyd's book, What the Media Are Doing to Our Politics. He says that the Gilligan affair must be seen in the context of a wider media narrative that assumes the government lies about everything. This is a serious charge. </p> <p>The question is not whether there is cynicism about politics, but whether journalism is the cause. If you believe that, then, yes, we need a post-Hutton era in which we purge this virus. But I don't believe it. For one thing, don't politicians have some responsibility for it? What about the so-called Tory sleaze and the way Labour made capital from it? Or the war many believe (rightly or wrongly) they were misled into supporting? </p> <p>Lloyd argues that the threat posed to democratic institutions is at its greatest \"when the media is at its most fearless\". What a remarkable thing for a journalist to say. We threaten democratic institutions when we are fearless. </p> <p>Well, we should be fearful of many things: getting it right, abiding by the law, genuine impartiality. We should not be fearful of standing up to those in power. That is our job: to be fearless in the face of power. In any era. </p> <p>I have not personally been leaned on by the bosses to go easy in the wake of Hutton. But it's not that simple. I've read about the \"knives being out\". Well, I can't remember when they weren't. What matters is something more subtle. The Lloyd thesis is not his alone. He has some powerful supporters. </p> <p>It's easy, in the shockwaves created by the Hutton report and all that preceded it, for confidence to be replaced by uncertainty, particularly when the phrase \"post-Hutton BBC\" is used to suggest that we have been cowed. It's easy for producers and editors to ask not only \"Is this right?\" (as they must) but \"Who might we be upsetting?\". Let me steal a phrase from Lord Hutton himself. It is possible to be \"subconsciously influenced\" into thinking this is what your masters might want. </p> <p>We need more, not less, in-depth interviewing of politicians. The idea that tough questions prevent politicians from giving answers, and gentle chats seduce them into candour is, frankly, risible. We need more, not less, investigative journalism. We need much more straightforward political analysis. Public service broadcasting can and must make an important contribution to the democratic process. It can do so only if not cowed by those in power. </p> <p>Halfway through my period of abstinence, I began to think television didn't matter much. I didn't miss it as entertainment; I have no great interest in sport, and I get all the news I need from newspapers, magazines and Radio 4. But you can't escape from it, its influence is everywhere. And I don't want to. </p> <p>I watched Life of Mammals with my four-year-old son on my lap. He was wide-eyed with wonder. It's not cutting edge. It's not shocking. It's old hat. But, like the very best of television, it really opens new windows on to the world. </p> <p>It may seem odd to end on this slightly soppy note. But I've been reminded after my long absence that television can enrich lives. It can lift our spirits. It can give us a deeper understanding of the human condition. It can help maintain the momentum that takes us from barbarity to civilisation. There is good stuff out there. Don't allow it be dragged down. First, do no harm. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Humphrys is a presenter on Radio 4's Today programme.

  "<p>David Varney is not anybody's idea of a typical taxman, but from next week he will become the top public face of both the Inland Revenue and of the Customs people who search your car at Dover. </p> <p>The state-educated south Londoner could not be further removed from bowler-hatted cartoon character Hector the Tax Inspector, who used to exhort us to get our end of year forms in. Relaxed and chirpy, the bearded 58-year-old is willing to comment on pretty much anything - including troubled Shell, where he worked for 28 years and is still viewed by some as a potential chairman. </p> <p>Varney stepped down from just such a job at mobile phone firm mmO2 last month and formally enters the rather less glossy and fast-moving world of tax returns next Wednesday. He has not only been charged by the government to lead the tax authorities but also Customs and Excise, as executive chairman of what will be called Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. </p> <p>He has a three-year contract, and during that time has to restructure a bureaucratic giant that will have 90,000 staff and a budget of \u00a34.2bn. More than 10,000 jobs are due to go and two complex IT systems have to be merged into one. </p> <p>Fixing the Revenue sounds not just daunting but also a bit worthy to many in the City, but Varney has always been a public-spirited and inquisitive type. </p> <p>He chairs Business in the Community and has always sat on an array of bodies, including the Institute of Employment Studies and thinktank Demos. Politics has been in the background since his days as a student union president but he certainly has the ear of Labour - or at least that of the ultimate tax boss, Gordon Brown. </p> <p>The new post has come at a convenient time for him. Last year he moved from full-time to part-time, and non-executive chairmanship at mmO2, which is marketed under the O2 brand, and which he has just squeezed into profit. </p> <p>He sees some parallels between his new job and what he had to do in spinning out O2 from BT. \"I think it's important for the country that the people who are charged with raising taxes and Customs and Excise are efficient and effective. So I decided I would do this one,\" he says. </p> <p>Varney insists he has no master plan and hopes to have a better picture of what needs to be done after talking to staff. He has not spent the break between jobs entirely at his Buckingham home with his wife, a retired doctor, but has also been visiting the organisations he must weld together. It is not as daunting as all that, he insists. \"It cannot be just two bits added together with a bit of efficiency saving but one that, because of its knowledge base and interface with its clients, can actually do more. We have seen in other parts of the world - Australia and Canada - where this sort of merger has produced more joined-up government.\" </p> <p>Revenue and Customs will formally come about via an act of parliament, but some basic outlines are clear. \"There will be a single organisation. The intention is not to have a neapolitan ice-cream with Customs, then Excise with a corporate management on top of that ... At the moment the organisations don't share information in an open sense and they have not been asked to do a single interface, but what we will look at is whether we could do a one-stop shop for various clients and customer groups.\" </p> <p>So, will the series of IT schemes be scrapped in favour of a single system? \"Give us a break. I don't start until September,\" he says. But he does make clear that the appointment of a chief of information services will be one of his first jobs. </p> <p>There is no doubt the tax system needs overhauling. Varney notes that Britain shares its fiscal structure with just two other nations, Israel and Malawi. \"There is a lovely line in the Canadian annual report which is about how there is no other part in the public service that touches so many Canadians. I think the new organisation could say the same thing.\" </p> <p>Not all those dealings will be cordial, however, given that the tax authorities are engaged in a crackdown to reduce an 8% gap between what they should pull in and what they actually do. Varney believes friction with the public is not a given because the majority want to pay the tax they owe. \"Most people want to comply with what their obligations are. There may be a degree of frustration surrounding that, but there is also a small group who do not want to comply - and they need to be deterred and detected, otherwise the burden on us who do want to comply will be higher.\" </p> <p>Asked whether he is impressed by what he has seen of Revenue and Customs and Excise so far, Varney's message is diplomatic but clear: \"We have a big job to do.\" </p> <p>Part of that task will be to shed 10,500 jobs and convince those who remain their future will be brighter. Varney has a reputation for being a decent bloke, but says he is no \"poodle\" to be manipulated by the government or shy away from tough decisions. At Shell he derecognised the T&amp;G union after it refused to cooperate in a restructuring of the Shellhaven refinery in Essex. </p> <p>Are we heading for the kind of clashes seen at Royal Mail, when Allan Leighton wanted to restructure the postal system? He says he does not expect problems with the civil service unions, adding he has yet to meet their representatives but looks forward to working with them. </p> <p>Varney clearly blames union unwillingness to accept change for the closure of Shellhaven, but says they have changed since the early 1990s, when that took place. \"I think most unions now want to be part of a successful organisation and recognise painful changes sometimes have to be made. That's not to say they are patsies, but the dialogue is different now. We had our moments at British Gas [where he was chief executive], but generally we got along well. I still get Christmas cards from some union leaders, so I can't be a complete ogre.\" </p> <p>He declines to discuss regional office closures and will only talk in general terms about wider staffing issues. \"Both organisations have a proud history and powerful internal cultures, but this provides an opportunity for a new organisation of which staff can be proud and leave a heritage for a future generation. The transformation offers a chance for people to show they can thrive and prosper in a new world,\" he says. </p> <p>Has he been surprised by anything he has seen so far? \"I do not surprise easily. When I came into O2 we wrote down all the potential risks to the business. I thought that was very useful. The best way of not being surprised is spending time looking at what can go wrong.\" </p> <p>He dismisses fears about the difficulty of recruiting new and younger staff, insisting many are looking for corporate responsibility or to spend time in the public sector. Varney makes comparisons with establishing O2 as a separate entity, and is proud many staff wanted to stay but accepts some chose to leave rather than continue the \"journey\". Since he joined two years ago O2 has broken into the FTSE 100, but its future as an independent remains in doubt, given its small size in a sector of giants. </p> <p>Would he not have preferred to secure its future by tying up a proposed merger earlier this year with KPN of Holland? \"No,\" he insists. \"The whole point of being on the FTSE is to be vulnerable, to make yourself efficient and effective for all shareholders.\" </p> <p>Varney admits to being \"very concerned\" about seeing Shell immersed in a reserves scandal. He went to the oil group's recent annual meeting, in part to see how another chairman dealt with such a crisis. Did he learn anything? His reply is withering: \"There were not many lessons I wanted to take away for the O2 board.\"</p>",
  "<p>Adrian Annus faces the threat of becoming the second Hungarian athlete to be stripped of a gold medal after he failed to show up for a drugs test yesterday. </p> <p>The hammer thrower was ordered by the International Olympic Committee to undertake a further test after it stripped his training partner Robert Fazekas of the gold medal he won in the discus. </p> <p>Fazekas, who shares the same coach as Annus, was caught trying to use a foreign device to trick the officials trying to obtain a urine sample and now faces a ban of up to two years by the International Association of Athletics Federations. </p> <p>Annus, 31, passed the doping test after the competition on Sunday but officials believe he may have used a similar contraption. However, he failed to show up at an arranged location in Austria to give the second urine sample demanded by the IOC. </p> <p>\"I presume that, if he fails to comply with all the rules and regulations of the doping code, the medal will be withdrawn,\" said Pal Schmitt, the president of the Hungarian Olympic Committee. </p> <p>Annus announced his retirement on Thursday because, he claimed, of the indignities he and his family had suffered. But he remains under the jurisdiction of IOC doping rules until the end of the games tomorrow. </p> <p>The IOC now has the DNA technology to test whether urine samples match. \"This is something we have in our weaponry,\" said Jacques Rogge, the IOC president. </p> <p>\"We didn't need it at this stage but we have it and it might be used in the future.\" </p> <p>Thousands of people in Fazekas's hometown of Szombathely demonstrated when he returned from Athens. </p> <p>\"I was treated badly,\" he said. \"They stripped me off and even looked into my backside. It was like the Gestapo method in World War Two.\" </p> <p>Fazekas said he had made a mistake when he left the doping control room without producing the amount of urine required for a sample. \"I tried six times but I could not produce the rest . . . I did make a mistake when I left but I was in a state of shock,\" he said. </p> <p>A dark cloud is hanging over Hungarian sport after another of its medallists, Ferenc Gyurkovics, tested positive and faces the prospect of being stripped of the silver medal he won in weightlifting. </p> <p>Russia also lost another athlete to doping when the 400 metres runner Anton Galkin produced a positive test for stanozolol, the anabolic steroid that caused Ben Johnson to be stripped of his 100m gold medal in Seoul 16 years ago. </p> <p>Meanwhile the IAAF has condemned the behaviour of Greek fans who delayed the start of the men's 200m final on Thursday by noisily protesting about the withdrawal from the games of the defending champion Kostas Kederis. </p> <p>\"The IAAF cannot approve any behaviour that is an obstacle to athletes' concentration,\" said the IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai. \"This was not an appropriate behaviour.\" </p> <p>The fans' frustration was fuelled by a decision earlier in the day by the IAAF to launch an inquiry into whether Kederis and his training partner Ekaterini Thanou deliberately evaded out-of-competition dope tests. </p> <p>Shawn Crawford, who led the United States to a clean sweep of medals in the race, said he understood what the Greeks were going through but did not let the booing affect him. \"I can understand that they were upset but I don't know why they had to react like this,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Georgina Harland radiated pure happiness after the thrilling d\u00e9nouement to what many believe is the purest discipline at the Olympic Games, the modern pentathlon. The British camp had hoped for gold and silver but there was no disguising everybody's delight when Harland, having begun the final 3,000m run in 14th place, and more than 49 seconds shy of third, won the bronze. </p> <p>It was a tremendous effort, recalling the scintillating run by Stephanie Cook at the Sydney Olympics when she snatched the gold on the final day of those games. Harland simply had too much to do to repeat that feat but the bronze was a triumph in itself. Had she ever thought it might be too much? \"It's never too much; it's the Olympics,\" she said, beaming and blowing kisses to her supporters. </p> <p>It transpired afterwards that Harland had suffered a stress fracture to her right leg a fortnight ago, which made her run all the more remarkable. Before the last race the British team leader Dominic Mahony had said he thought Harland was in with a chance, whereas he knew Kate Allenby's hopes had all but disappeared in the showjumping ring. </p> <p>In the process of finishing third Harland overtook Allenby, who won bronze in Australia four years ago. She was understandably distraught afterwards, with her medal chances ruined in the riding when her horse, Babar, took seven rails. </p> <p>Before that disastrous round Allenby was in the silver medal position, just as in Sydney. Riding is normally her strongest discipline, although on this occasion perhaps the tempo of the round was a little too slow. The riders draw lots for their horse and this time Allenby drew a short straw, although none of the 32 competitors jumped clear. </p> <p>The modern pentathlon, which did not become an Olympic event for women until Sydney, comprises five disciplines - shooting, fencing, swimming, riding and running. Harland knew the worst would be at the beginning and so it proved. </p> <p>By the end of the shooting she was third from last, with hopes of a medal taking a severe early knock. Allenby had also struggled but came back strongly in the \u00e9p\u00e9e, in which she finished second. But it was in the swimming - 200m freestyle - that the challenge of the British pair accelerated. Harland was the second fastest, with Allenby fifth, taking her to second overall. </p> <p>Harland has spent much of the season as world No1 after winning the European Championships last August and followed that with gold at the World Cup final in Athens in December. Unfortunately she could never fully recover from her horrible start in the shooting. It is her weakest discipline but even by her own standards she shot poorly. </p> <p>Not that she ever gave up hope of a medal, because of the power of her running. However, as the riding approached, with its 12 showjumping fences, there seemed every chance that Allenby would be in the hunt for gold. The competitors collect points in the first four events and they are translated into time for the 3,000m, which is run as a handicap event, adding hugely to the excitement and drama. </p> <p>Before the riding each athlete gets about 20 minutes to bond with her horse and it was soon obvious that Allenby was going to have problems. It was a question of whether she could limit the damage of Babar's careless jumping and it proved impossible. She finished 25th in the riding and her hopes were gone - silver or gold to nothing in a couple of minutes. </p> <p>\"I don't know what was wrong with him. He was behaving like an emu and had his head so far up that he couldn't see his feet,\" said Allenby, admitting that, if she had been able to ride the horse again, she would not have known what to do differently. </p> <p>Harland had an altogether better ride, although not quite good enough to give her a realistic chance of overhauling Hungary's Zsuzsanna Voros, who won the gold, or the silver medal winner Jelena Rublevska of Latvia. \"It was just too much but I was really chuffed with my run,\" said Harland, who was easily the fastest, covering the twisting course in 10:17.31. She had every right to be.</p>",
  "<p>Just a few moments before the medal ceremony the Greeks hoped would see Kostas Kederis stand atop the podium, the Chinese found the man they will be pinning their hopes on in Beijing in four years' time. </p> <p>Preparations were being made for the award of the medals to the winners of the 200 metres, which of course did not feature Kederis, when the runners lined up for the 110m hurdles. </p> <p>Liu Xiang then blasted to a stunning victory in the 110m hurdles to equal Colin Jackson's 11-year-old world record of 12.91sec - 0.15 faster than he has ever run before. </p> <p>There was initial confusion because the trackside clock stopped at 12.94. Few were as stunned as Liu when it was rounded down so much. </p> <p>\"This is a miracle,\" said Liu, a 21-year-old from Shanghai. \"I'm too tired to even cry. I'm proud not just for myself and for China but for Asia.\" </p> <p>He even remained unflustered after a false start by the American Terrence Trammell and made a brilliant start to the race, pulling three metres clear of the field by the finish line. </p> <p>While others floundered the Chinese maintained his rhythm and screamed in delighted disbelief as he flashed over the line. </p> <p>\"I never dreamed I could break the world record,\" Liu said. \"I have never run under 13 seconds, even in training.\" </p> <p>Liu is the first Chinese man to win an Olympic title on the track and will be elevated to the position of poster boy for the Beijing games. </p> <p>Liu's parents were initially set against him becoming an athlete, their minds full of stories of young children being taken from their homes and put through appalling state training regimens. </p> <p>Britain's 4x100 metres relay team managed to avoid their normal disaster to reach their first Olympic final for 12 years. </p> <p>In the last two games, in 1996 and 2000, the squad has managed to let potential medals slip through their butterfingers after failing to get the baton round in the heat. </p> <p>On this occasion the four of Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis successfully avoided mishaps to take their place in the final today. </p> <p>That does not mean there were no close shaves. Lewis-Francis, on the final leg, set off a shade too early and had to check himself to ensure he received the baton from Devonish before he stepped out of the exchange zone. His few paces out of his lane went unpunished because they were in an outer lane and did not impede another runner. </p> <p>The relay is a shot at redemption for the sprinters, who as a group have been heavily criticised by Jackson, now working for the BBC. </p> <p>For the first time since 1976 none of them reached the 100m final and Campbell's ambition of improving on the 200m silver medal he won in Sydney ended in acrimony. </p> <p>He failed to qualify for the final because of a hamstring strain and then, in the early hours of the morning after his race, he became involved in an argument with Michael Johnson, who had criticised him, at a nightclub in the Greek capital. </p> <p>Britain finished second in their heat in 38.53sec, fifth fastest overall, behind a strong United States squad, who had enough strength in depth to be able to rest the 100m champion Justin Gatlin. Maurice Greene, the bronze medallist, brought the defending champions home in 38.02 after the 200m champion Shawn Crawford had run the opening leg. Darvis Patton and Coby Miller were the other runners. </p> <p>\"Tomorrow we will strike it out and let the times drop,\" said Greene, who predicted the US would break the world record of 37.40 that they set at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. \"It was easy, it was fun.\" </p> <p>Four years ago after they won in Sydney it was claimed that the Americans had embarrassed their country with their flag-draping, muscle-flexing celebrations. </p> <p>It led to American athletes being given lessons on how to win gracefully by the US Olympic Committee. </p> <p>A video of the 4x100m relay team's reaction in 2000 is now included in a package designed to show Americans how to deal appropriately with victory. </p> <p>Fellow athletes cringed and the Australian crowd booed Greene, Jon Drummond, Bernard Williams and Brian Lewis. The sprinters flexed and posed for several minutes on a self-satisfied victory lap - two of them bare chested and draped in the Stars and Stripes. </p> <p>Earlier, in the searing heat of an Athenian morning, Poland's Robert Korzeniowski had won a record third consecutive gold medal in the 50 kilometres walk, the fourth Olympic title of his career. </p> <p>The 36-year-old, who also made history in Sydney when he became the first to claim the 20km-50km walk double, won in 3hr 38min 46sec. </p> <p>At 30km he and Australia's Nathan Deakes, the 20km bronze medallist, put on a spurt and opened up a 50 metres lead, only for his rival to be disqualified for lifting five kilometres later, although he briefly carried on in the vain hope that the judges had made a mistake.</p>",
  "<p>Premier Rugby, the umbrella body representing England's elite clubs, is seeking a review of the automatic relegation policy from the Zurich Premiership following the financial collapse of the demoted Rotherham. </p> <p>A consortium has assembled a rescue package for the Titans which Twickenham is considering. Rotherham's plight echoes that of Bristol who suffered the drop 12 months before and lost all their players after the owner Malcolm Pearce withdrew his backing. </p> <p>Automatic relegation is due to continue for another four seasons, but a review is possible if Premier Rugby and First Division Rugby agree, with a return to a play-off system the preferred way for the former. </p> <p>\"There is nothing romantic about automatic relegation,\" said Howard Thomas, the chief executive of Premier Rugby. \"It causes untold misery and destabilises the sport. What has happened to Rotherham and Bristol in the last two years shows that this issue requires renewed debate. The backers of Rotherham could not be expected to write cheques for ever. </p> <p>\"The gulf between the Premiership and the First Division is too high in both financial and playing terms. The one is a fully professional league, where standards and facilities improve each year, while the other is semi-professional at best. </p> <p>\"By giving clubs a mere 12 months lease in the Premiership, we are denying ourselves investment from backers and banks to improve facilities still further. It is no use pretending we are like soccer. Imagine what would happen if a team from football's Premiership was relegated to the Conference, yet our system is the equivalent of that.\" </p> <p>Premier Rugby provided Rotherham's parachute payment of \u00a3760,000 in one lump sum this month to allow the club to meet the wage bill and help the consortium bidding to take control, but Thomas admitted it was small compensation for the loss of status. </p> <p>\"The average turnover of a club in the Premiership is \u00a36m a year while in the First Division it is \u00a31m\" he said. \"That is a huge difference and we feel that it is both right and sensible to have a play-off system to prove that the club seeking promotion is stronger than the one which finishes at the bottom of the Premiership.\" </p> <p>Australia yesterday lost the second member of their coaching team in as many days when Andrew Blades joined Roger Gould in resigning. </p> <p>\"The timing has nothing to do with Roger's decision\" said Blades, who did not inform the Australia coach Eddie Jones about his decision in advance.</p>"
