  "Wayne Rooney's agent cried in court yesterday as he described months of wrangling with a rival agent for control over the footballer. <p>Paul Stretford, 46, who runs the Proactive agency, says he was blackmailed by three men, boxing promoter John Hyland and brothers Anthony and Christopher Bacon, after Rooney signed to his agency. All three deny the charge of blackmail. </p> <p>The men are accused of acting in a threatening manner during a meeting at a Cheshire hotel in June 2003, which was secretly filmed by Mr Stretford. Mr Hyland, who worked with the player's original agent, was reluctant to give up control of the player and wanted 50% of the agent's earnings for Rooney for the next decade. </p> <p>Mr Stretford told Warrington crown court he had offered to buy out their interest in Rooney for \u00a35,000, but this had been rejected. The men met several times over a seven-month period to try to negotiate a settlement. </p> <p>The agent, who represents 270 of the world's top footballers, said that at a meeting in December 2002 he offered to give 50% of his net profits on Rooney for three years but Mr Hyland refused. Mr Stretford said: \"John [Hyland] went ballistic. He was very annoyed and angry.\" </p> <p>Asked by the prosecution barrister, John Hedgecoe, how the disagreement had affected his health, Mr Stretford broke down in tears and asked for a moment to compose himself. He said he had developed arthritis in his foot caused by stress. He was also found to have a heart defect. </p> <p>\"Physically and emotionally I was not in a great position,\" he said. \"It was just another layer of problems and another layer of stress and anxiety to deal with.\" </p> <p>Earlier Mr Hyland's barrister, Lord Carlile, said Mr Stretford had regarded Rooney, who recently transferred to Manchester United for \u00a327m, as a cash cow and was \"desperate\" to represent him. Mr Stretford was paid \u00a31.5m from Manchester United for the transfer, Lord Carlile said. </p> <p>He told Judge David Hale: \"It is the defence assertion that Mr Stretford was desperate to get Wayne Rooney as his client because he knew he could milk the cow from both ends. If a solicitor was doing that, he would be struck off without a moment's hesitation. </p> <p>\"There is an issue in this case about Paul Stretford's many interests in Wayne Rooney and the ruthless way in which he approached those interests.\" </p> <p>The footballer's father told the court that in summer 2002, six months before his contract with his first agent was to expire, he had been to see the Liverpool-based solicitor Kevin Dooley for advice about changing his son's agent. Wayne Rooney senior was asked by Lord Carlile if he was aware that Mr Dooley, who has since died, was at the time under investigation for defrauding clients out of thousands of pounds and was later struck off. Mr Rooney said he had not known this. </p> <p>The prosecutor, Mr Hedgecoe, said the three defendants were \"clearly involved in a very intimidating episode of blackmail in a case where the stakes were potentially enormous\". </p> <p>The trial, expected to last at least two weeks, continues.</p>",
  "<p>Muddle and accident shape the future of football as much as a manager's scheming. To England's surprise, they find themselves preparing to set Wayne Rooney and Jermain Defoe at the Wales defence on Saturday. Michael Owen is only 24 but, with a back injury making his involvement uncertain, it is almost as if an older generation is leaving the stage. </p> <p>The 18-year-old Rooney has been a touchstone of the country's hopes ever since he made his first start against Turkey in April 2003. That would have been enough of a youth revolution for even those spectators with the shortest of attention spans, but further novelty may be on the way. </p> <p>It must be a fast-track promotion that sweeps Defoe, who is 22 tomorrow, from being a standby who did not reach Euro 2004 to the man who may be kicking off in a crucial World Cup qualifier. His own eagerness has jostled Sven-Goran Eriksson into elevating him so soon. </p> <p>Despite the deftness, there is an impatience to the striker that is almost raw. It led him to a booking for a thoughtless challenge on Everton's David Weir last weekend. The collapse of his self-control was even less pardonable last season when his dissatisfaction over being stuck at West Ham saw him estrange himself from the club with offences that brought suspension. </p> <p>In short, he is not an unblemished enthusiast. None the less, goalscorers thrive only when there is some degree of self-absorption. Without it, he might not have whirled round his marker and put the team ahead with an exuberant finish against Poland in his first start for England last month. </p> <p>A lack of reflection and an obliviousness to dogged team play is also at the heart of Rooney's achievements. His mind assesses situations with remarkable speed, but there is another part of him that barely calculates at all as a goal is scored almost intuitively. </p> <p>The combination of Defoe and Rooney is therefore an enthralling possibility. Wales's likely centre-half partnership of Danny Gabbidon and Andy Melville is less equipped to block their path than others they have, separately, brushed aside before. And yet it must make a difference if too much depends solely on them. </p> <p>Eriksson is being stampeded into a trust in them. Since the 2002 World Cup, Teddy Sheringham has grown too old, Robbie Fowler has dimmed and Emile Heskey is attempting to re-establish at Birmingham the confidence he lost at Liverpool; there is no longer a place for him even in the outskirts of the England squad. </p> <p>Darius Vassell, unsure of selection at Aston Villa, has turned into a stereotype, rigidly viewed by Eriksson as a useful substitute for the very late phases of a match. The manager speaks well of Alan Smith, but his target-man qualities will not always suit an England team who like to prosper through rapid counter-attack. </p> <p>It is a joy for Eriksson to name Rooney, but he may turn to Defoe primarily out of necessity. He has the air of a man eager to cling to his faith in Owen, if only the vice-captain can confirm his fitness in tomorrow's practice session. </p> <p>There is, after all, no cause for Eriksson to discard lightly a forward who has provided 14 goals in 23 competitive matches during the Swede's tenure. Even Defoe, who does not noticeably suffer from a lack of self-belief, might pause to wonder about the size of the gap in the team he would be trying to fill. </p> <p>As far as anyone can tell, his own form may have slipped since the game with Poland in Katowice. Tottenham Hotspur do not make many openings for him to show his sharpness, but Eriksson must have hoped he would coin a chance for himself unassisted. His only goal since his opener against Poland came at Oldham in the Carling Cup. </p> <p>Defoe, of course, may feel liberated by his removal from the rigidity that Jacques Santini is entitled to see as the first phase in the remodelling of Spurs. The two likely candidates available to Eriksson, should Owen be ruled out, do seem to be wonderfully complementary. </p> <p>Rooney likes the deeper areas and it is simple to imagine him manipulating situations in which the mobile Defoe, with his nimble changes of direction, can evade the last man and let fly at goal. To some extent, too, they can reverse duties since Rooney evidently has no difficulty in coming through to score himself. </p> <p>The one nagging concern is that an experiment will be forced on Eriksson if Owen is not fit. Defoe and Rooney have never started together for England and now they may have to do so in a World Cup qualifier. The manager's friendlies are almost insufferable but the population would have tolerated just one more to let the two young forwards test their rapport with nothing whatsoever at stake.</p>",
  "<p>A militant wing of Manchester United supporters is ready to mobilise on both sides of the Atlantic to deter the billionaire American tycoon Malcolm Glazer from taking control of the club. </p> <p>The 61-year-old United director Maurice Watkins's house and two cars were daubed with red paint on Monday night. However, the attack is believed by no means to be the haphazard work of angry individuals. Instead, it is thought this will be the first act of a sustained campaign to destabilise any attempted takeover of the stock-market-listed club. Acts of violence have not been ruled out. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Old Trafford club moved last night to calm the unease, saying: \"Manchester United condemns the acts of vandalism committed against one of its directors, Maurice Watkins, yesterday. The behaviour of a few individuals does nothing to enhance the reputation of the club they claim to support.\" </p> <p>Police sources would not rule out offering protection to United directors if the attacks turn to persons rather than property, but no decision will be taken until the investigation has run its course. United would not comment on whether they had stepped up their security arrangements. </p> <p>The motivation for the attack on Watkins, the largest single private investor in United with 1.9% of the club, is believed to have been that he sold 1m shares to Glazer this year, helping take the American's equity interest to 19.3%. With the Irish investors JP McManus and John Magnier also in possession of a 28.9% stake in United, via their Cubic Expression fund, Glazer needs only to persuade them to sell in order to tip his holding beyond the 30% required to facilitate a takeover. </p> <p>Though his assets are valued at \u00a3630m, Glazer does not have the means to cover a straight cash bid for the club, which would necessitate about \u00a3800m. The concern for fans is that he would load his investment with debt, which would require servicing from company profits, while delisting the club and drawing his own dividend. </p> <p>Activists are prepared to \"fight dirty\" in their attempt to prevent this eventuality. A group styling itself the Manchester Education Committee has already attacked the racing interests of McManus and Magnier after they entered into a legal dispute with the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>",
  "Islam Dwidar's classmates were still taking in her shocking death - the teacher weeping outside before facing the girls, her closest friend recounting how they walked to school together each day - when the news arrived about Tahreer Abu El Jidyan. <p>The two 15-year-old pupils at Jabaliya's school were both shot in the head by Israeli soldiers inside their homes just a few blocks and several hours apart. Islam died almost immediately after the bullet smashed through her forehead as she baked bread with her mother in their yard on Sunday. Tahreer is still on life support at a Gaza hospital after an operation to remove shards of shattered skull from her brain. </p> <p>She lies motionless, with little to suggest she is alive other than gentle breathing. Doctors do not expect her to survive. </p> <p>Tahreer's mother, Intisar, was at her bedside yesterday. </p> <p>\"Oh Tahreer, my heart. I wish I were lying in this bed, not you,\" she whispered to her child. \"She was sweeping the floor in front of the door,\" said Mrs Abu El Jidyan. \"I was standing talking to her. We knew the Israeli soldiers were around, we knew they had snipers in the buildings on our street but we didn't expect what happened. They just shot her in the head. Her brains spilled out. She said: 'Mum, I'm hit'. She praised God and she collapsed.\" </p> <p>There were two bullets. The first struck Tahreer in the head. As she fell, the second hit the wall behind her. \"I've no doubt a sniper shot her deliberately. There was no fighting in the area. There were no other shots, only the ones that hit Tahreer,\" said her mother. </p> <p>With her stood Tahreer's 14-year-old brother, Naser, who was wounded by shrapnel last week. Israeli forces killed their father 11 years ago during the first intifada. </p> <p>Mrs Abu El Jidyan regrets preventing Tahreer from walking to school on Sunday morning. She thought it would be too dangerous to venture out of their home in Jabaliya's Sikka neighbourhood because it is on the edge of the area occupied by Israeli troops and tanks last week. Snipers are posted in buildings overlooking their street and a tank is less than a block away. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't let her out of the house but it was dangerous at home too. When there was fighting, bullets came through the walls. We stopped using some rooms on the side where the Israelis are,\" she said. </p> <p>Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups say that about half of the nearly 80 people killed by the army over the past week of \"Operation Days of Penitence\" are civilians. The military says it has carefully targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters with missile strikes. </p> <p>But while the numbers are in dispute - in part because it is often hard to say whether youths in their mid to late teens are bystanders or part of the Palestinian resistance - there is no doubt that a growing number of children have been felled by Israeli snipers. </p> <p>At Islam and Tahreer's school in Jabaliya yesterday morning, the headmistress, Rukaya Kamal al Budani, fielded calls from parents wanting to know if it was safe to send their girls. \"If they can get here, it's safe,\" was her stock reply. But of 1,150 pupils, fewer than 200 turned up. </p> <p>Before word reached the school about Tahreer, Mrs al Budani was getting to grips with the death of Islam. </p> <p>\"This is our first casualty at the school,\" she said. \"I don't know how to deal with the girls. It's going to have a big impact on her classmates and friends. I'm shocked that no one in the free world condemns the killing of a child.\" </p> <p>Then one of the male teachers tells Mrs al Budani about the shooting of Tahreer the previous day. The headmistress sits in silence. </p> <p>Until June, the two young women had been classmates, but then Tahreer failed her exams and was held back for a year. Asmaa Abu Samaan walked to school with her each morning. </p> <p>\"I met her in front of my house each morning to walk to school. I did my homework with her. I keep thinking that if she is brain-dead and not killed perhaps she is still suffering. I can't stand it,\" she said. </p> <p>Asmaa walked to school yesterday morning without her friend.\"I walked against the wall hoping the soldiers can't see me. I want to go to school because I know the Jews do not want us to study because we need to be educated to build our country,\" she said. </p> <p>But the killing went on as the conflict claimed the life of another teenage girl in the Gaza strip yesterday. Palestinian medics said Israeli soldiers fired about 20 bullets into 13- year-old Iman al-Hams, including five into her head. </p> <p>The military said she had entered a forbidden zone in Rafah refugee camp, and that she dropped a bag that soldiers feared was a bomb. </p> <p>The Palestinians said Iman was walking to school when troops entered the camp and that she dropped her bag as she ran away in fear. </p> <p>The bag was not found to contain a bomb.</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has taken control of the per una womenswear brand, handing over \u00a3125m to its founder George Davies. </p> <p>The acquisition was announced by M&amp;S chief executive Stuart Rose in July as part of his turnaround plan for the struggling chain after he was brought in to fend off a \u00a39bn takeover attempt by billionaire Philip Green. </p> <p>The per una range - more fashionable than standard M&amp;S clothing and aimed at younger shoppers - was invented by Mr Davies in 2001. The high street fashion guru who was behind Next in the early 1980s and the \u00a31bn-selling George at Asda brand, was called in by M&amp;S's previous chief executive Roger Holmes to help stem falling sales. </p> <p>The unusual business deal thrashed out by the two men involved Mr Davies acting as a supplier but owning the brand and doing his own PR and marketing. </p> <p>The ranges quickly proved successful. Per una is understood to generate annual sales of more than \u00a3250m and account for about 15% of M&amp;S womenswear sales. </p> <p>One of Mr Rose's first moves at M&amp;S was to take action to secure the per una brand for M&amp;S. Buying the brand - which is sold in 170 of the chain's 300 outlets - ensures that it can never be withdrawn from the stores and secures all the profit generated by the label. </p> <p>\"This is a very important part of our womenswear,\" said an M&amp;S spokeswoman. \"It's very close to the season, reflecting themes and styles from the catwalk.\" </p> <p>The \u00a3125m price includes the continued services of Mr Davies, who will stay on as chief executive for at least two years. The relationship with Mr Davies is one of the few recent successes at M&amp;S, which has been bleeding market share to rivals since 1997.</p>",
  "<p>There was Bono at the Labour party conference last week, recalling a visit to famine-stricken Ethiopia during the Live Aid summer of 1985: \"I became the worst thing of all - a rock star with a cause\". Hmm, surely the worst thing in the world is a rock star who overestimates his ability to bend politicians' ears to his cause. He's become polished at talking the talk, but has his Drop the Debt campaign (which aims to get the west to write off loans to developing countries) really achieved much in material terms?</p> <p>There was that heavily-promoted charity gig he organised at Wembley Stadium this week in 1999, featuring A-listers like George Michael and Robbie Williams, but it had little impact and was soon forgotten in the general pre-millennial nuttiness.

The Rock the Vote campaign in 2000 proved this, by signally failing to rock the vote enough to keep George Bush out of the White House.

  "<p>Irish pharmaceuticals group Elan said yesterday that it would set aside $55m (\u00a330.5m) against the costs of settling legal actions in the United States. </p> <p>The group is facing an inquiry by the US watchdog, the securities and exchange commission, and a shareholder class action relating to concerns about its use of off-balance sheet units which emerged in early 2002. </p> <p>Elan said the $55m provision was in addition to existing insurance cover which is thought to be in the region of $45m, taking the estimated total cost of the settlement to $100m. </p> <p>\"The company is in discussions to resolve both the shareholder class action lawsuit and the SEC investigation as soon as practicable,\" Elan said in a statement. \"We are committed to a resolution of both these issues. The process takes time and it's not our timeline,\" added a spokeswoman. </p> <p>In 2002 the news that the company's accounting policies had come under scrutiny sparked a crash in the pharmaceutical group's shares from more than \u20ac50 to less than 10% of their peak value. However, with a balance sheet strengthened by a series of disposals and cost-cutting measures, Elan's market value has rallied with the sharestrading at just under \u20ac20. </p> <p>\"Given that the company is in the final stages of negotiation with the SEC on the investigation and, we assume, is concurrently in contact with the lead plaintiffs in the class action, this reserve would imply a settlement in the $100m-plus region,\" said Ian Hunter at Dublin stockbroker Goodbody. </p> <p>\"We believe that this will be seen as a positive conclusion to the litigation overhang.\" </p> <p>Jack Gorman at stockbrokers Davy said settlement of the SEC investigation and the class action was likely to be positive for the share price. </p> <p>\"Resolution of the investigation and related law suits immediately opens up latent demand from institutions previously barred from buying the stock, opens up additional US research coverage of the stock and removes any impediment from corporates looking at buying Elan.\" </p> <p>The company is due to report interim figures this week.</p>",
  "Police in France yesterday found more arms caches and a secret shooting range belonging to Eta, while Spanish politicians claimed that a vast, ongoing operation against the armed separatists would hasten the end of the Basque terrorist group. <p>The arrests on Sunday of Eta leader Mikel Albizu and the group's most senior woman, Soledad Iparraguirre, at a farmhouse in south-west France was the start of an operation that would last months, the Spanish interior minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alonso, said yesterday. </p> <p>Seven safe-houses and at least four arms caches still have to be searched for clues by French anti-terrorist police - a job that, on its own, is expected to take more than a week. </p> <p>Yesterday a new arms cache, stocked with detonators and explosives, was found in the garden of one of the safe-houses, according to Spanish press reports. One of the houses searched on Sunday, at Saint Pierre de Irube, turned out to have an underground shooting range used for practising with small arms. </p> <p>With 16 other people still being held by police yesterday and large quantities of sub-machine guns, grenade launchers and explosives already discovered, experts said the operation would leave Eta weaker than at any time in the past 30 years. </p> <p>\"Eta is now further weakened and in very bad shape,\" the interior minister told Spanish state television, before warning that the group was not yet defeated. </p> <p>Police were hoping to find details of the group's membership and funding, as well as more arms and explosives. </p> <p>Mr Albizu and Ms Iparraguirre had spent four years living in a French farmhouse near the village of Salis-de-B\u00e9arn. They rented the house from a farmer, a village councillor who lived in a smaller house on the same estate. He has also been arrested. </p> <p>The couple had a daughter who attended the local primary school. Local people were shocked at hearing of their high-level involvement in Eta. \"It can't be true. They had a child,\" one neighbour told Spain's El Mundo newspaper yesterday. </p> <p>The farmhouse was an hour's drive from the Spanish border and the Basque region where the group traditionally carries out most of its attacks. </p> <p>Experts yesterday speculated that leadership would pass into the hands of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Urrutikoetxea, alias Josu Ternera, a veteran of the group who served a prison sentence before becoming a regional deputy for the separatist Batasuna party in the Basque parliament. </p> <p>Mr Ternera disappeared two years ago after the party, which obtained up to 10% of the vote in Spain's semi-autonomous Basque region, was declared illegal. He is reported to have returned to Eta, but police believe that the 54-year-old may be seriously ill. </p> <p>\"The signs point to Ternera,\" said Rogelio Alonso, a terrorism expert at Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid. \"The latest operation is part of a trend. We have seen very important arrests over the last year and the rhythm at which they are happening is extraordinary. Eta is so penned in that it will now find things very difficult.\" </p> <p>Eta is known to have considered increasing the randomness of its violence in recent years, but is aware that it is losing its support among hardline separatists. It has not killed for 16 months, making this the group's quietest period - barring temporary ceasefires - since 1972. </p> <p>Spanish politicians have been claiming for several years that they have Eta on the run, with the previous conservative government pointing to the arrests of nearly 200 suspected members over recent years. </p> <p>\"There is only one thing we can say to Eta: that its destiny is for there to be an end to violence,\" the Spanish prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, said yesterday. </p> <p>But the interior minister warned that the weapons and explosives seized in Sunday's raids showed Eta was still capable of attacking. </p> <p>No official figures for the amount of explosives and ammunition captured have yet been provided but Spain's leading newspaper, El Pa\u00eds, said it included 400kg (880lb) of dynamite and 40,000 rounds of ammunition. </p> <p>\"Clearly, the material that was seized - the weapons as well as the explosives and the detonators, etc - show that the gang had a major arsenal,\" the interior minister said.</p>",
  "President Thabo Mbeki has made a withering attack on commentators who argue that violent crime is out of control in South Africa, calling them white racists who want the country to fail. <p>He said crime was falling but some journalists distorted reality by depicting black people as \"barbaric savages\" who liked to rape and kill. </p> <p>Annual statistics published last month show that most categories of crime are down, but some have challenged the figures' credibility and say that South Africa remains extremely dangerous, especially for women. </p> <p>In a column for the African National Congress website, the president rebuked the doubters and scorned a white journalist, Charlene Smith, who has championed victims of sexual violence since writing about her own rape. </p> <p>Mocking her description as an \"internationally recognised expert on sexual violence\", Mr Mbeki did not name Ms Smith but quoted a recent article in which she said South Africa had the highest rate of rape. </p> <p>\"She was saying our cultures, traditions and religions as Africans inherently make every African man a potential rapist ... [a] view which defines the African people as barbaric savages.\" </p> <p>Mr Mbeki also described the predominantly white newspaper The Citizen, and other commentators who challenge the apparent fall in crime, as pessimists who did not trust black rule. </p> <p>His online letter has become a launchpad for attacks on the media, multinationals and opposition parties. </p> <p>Ms Smith, who went public in 1999 after she was raped and stabbed in Johannesburg, said yesterday that the statistics were too low because many victims withdrew their complaints after being paid by the assailants. \"The president is in denial,\" she said. \"I have been very careful to keep saying that rape has nothing to do with race.\"</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United's directors barely disguised their gritted teeth yesterday as they issued the statement the outside world has been awaiting for months: Britain's richest football club has received a possible takeover offer. </p> <p>It did not name the would-be bidder but his identity is not in doubt. He is Malcolm Glazer, the septuagenarian owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team, who has built a 19% stake in United over 18 months and has never denied his ultimate ambition is full control. </p> <p>It is early days, but yesterday's announcement could be the first stage of the biggest takeover in football history, as it later emerged that a second consortium was secretly exploring the possibility of a bid. United's stock market value is \u00a3710m and a successful bid might have to reach \u00a3800m to succeed - well above the \u00a3623m price BSkyB wanted to pay six years ago before its bid was blocked on competition grounds. </p> <p>Do not expect it to be quick or straightforward, though. Mr Glazer is not a bidder in the style of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea. It is understood he plans to lead a consortium of investment funds that would attempt to turn United into a private company. If successful, such a move would be likely to reinforce the position of team manager Sir Alex Ferguson - Mr Glazer is known to be an admirer - but provoke concerns among supporters that the club would be milked for cash. </p> <p>One banker familiar with Mr Glazer's thinking said his plan was still at an early stage with no guarantee that a formal offer will be made. \"This is all very preliminary,\" he said. \"What Glazer is interested in doing is getting a number of private equity investors involved. His own stake might be only 25% or so.\" Mr Glazer has appointed JP Morgan, the American investment bank, to work on fund-raising but faces one obvious obstacle in the form of the Irish investors JP McManus and John Magnier, whose Cubic Expression fund owns almost 30% of United shares. </p> <p>It would be virtually impossible to buy United without securing the support of Cubic and there was no indication yesterday that Mr Glazer has even discussed his idea with the Irish duo. \"The first they [McManus and Magnier] heard about this was this morning's announcement,\" said one adviser to the Irishmen, who stand to make substantial profits if they sell their shares for cash. They are thought to have built their stake at an average price of 180p a share; selling at the current share price would yield a profit for them of about \u00a370m. That does not preclude Cubic joining Mr Glazer's consortium, but the complexities suggest any formal offer - if it materialises - could be weeks or months away. That fact provoked deep frustration within United's boardroom, with one official describing Mr Glazer's proposal as \"back-of-the-envelope at best\". </p> <p>Scepticism was also evident between the lines of the club's formal announcement to the stock exchange. \"This approach contains a number of significant conditions,\" the statement said. </p> <p>Mr Glazer has been a constant source of frustration for the United board since he started buying shares 18 months ago. For the first six months, the American refused all pleas from United chairman Sir Roy Gardner for a meeting. The chief executive, David Gill, was eventually dispatched to Florida for a brief discussion, since when the United board has tried to represent its relationship with Mr Glazer as \"friendly\". Mr Glazer, though, has shown little interest in travelling to Britain; the first time he saw United play was during the club's pre-season tour to the United States, although two of his sons have shown more enthusiasm. </p> <p>He also has done nothing to try to soften his image with United fans, despite the acclaim he has enjoyed in Florida thanks to his transformation of the Buccaneers. When he bought the franchise in 1995 for $192m (\u00a3107m), the Bucs were among the no-hopers of American football; under his ownership, they won the Superbowl in 2003. </p> <p>Bucs' fans were happy to sing his praises, and for a time Mr Glazer took to running down the touchline before games. Nicknamed the leprechaun because of his squat appearance and ginger beard, he has also been controversial; at Tampa Bay he has increased ticket prices and threatened to move them out of the city unless public money was used to build a new stadium. </p> <p>The wealth that allowed him to buy the Bucs was generated via a variety of ventures. He took over his watch business at the age of 15, and has sold motor homes and been involved in food processing. Building shopping malls has been a lucrative venture and he also bought into an oil exploration company called Zapata founded by George Bush senior. His fortune was estimated by Forbes magazine last year at $1bn - wealthy, but not enough to buy outright control of United on his own, even if he could turn all his assets to cash. </p> <p>The idea that he would recruit private equity firms will cause deepest alarm on the Old Trafford terraces. Such funds tend to operate as partnerships and are notoriously shy about revealing details of their own financial performance and the rewards for their directors, some of whom are reckoned to be among the City's biggest earners. Private equity funds tend to be attracted to companies with substantial assets and predictable cash flows. United would meet both criteria: it owns its stadium, which is sold out for every home game; it has a 13-year contract with Nike to manufacture replica shirts; and it has long-term sponsorship deals with Vodafone and Audi. </p> <p>To critics, though, private equity is shorthand for financial engineering. Companies tend to be loaded up with debt and long-term investment is sometimes postponed. At United, which has just paid \u00a327m for Wayne Rooney, there would be worries that the transfer budget would be curtailed. There is also concern within the club that Mr Glazer might veto proposals to increase the capacity of Old Trafford by 7,500 seats at a cost of \u00a339m.</p>",

  "The Conservative's advertising guru Lord Saatchi tonight made a rare appearance on the conference platform to reassure Tory delegates that Labour would lose the next election. <p>Declaring a new law of political philosophy - modestly dubbing it \"Saatchi's law\" - he claimed it was as certain \"as the law of gravity\" that disillusionment with Tony Blair would result in a Labour defeat.</p> <p>Homing in on the prime minister's personal reputation, he described Saatchi's law as \"satisfaction equals performance minus expectation\".</p> <p>\"Look at the workings of the law on the reputation of the prime minister,\" he said, arguing that the prime minister had given the country \"a masterclass on messianic man\".</p> <p>He compared Labour's five-year plans with Stalinist Russia, before quoting the statistics commission as finding the government had used \"unreliable figures\" for \"political reasons\".</p> <p>Lord Saatchi - who famously came up with the \"Labour Isn't Working\" slogan for the 1979 election - received rapturous applause from the party faithful.</p> <p>But earlier, divisions between the centrist and true-blue wings of the party were on show. </p> <p>Immediately preceding Lord Saatchi was Tim Yeo, the shadow environment and transport secretary, who made space in his speech to put the case for tacking to the middle ground.</p> <p>He said: \"A party is only ready for government when it addresses the concerns of all voters and not just those of its own supporters.</p> <p>\"Elections are won on the centre ground. Margaret Thatcher understood that. Tony Blair understands that. We understand it too.\"</p> <p>However, just an hour earlier at a Daily Telegraph fringe meeting, the party chairman, Liam Fox, a standard bearer for the Thatcherite wing, expressed his delight at the return to a more true-blue agenda.</p> <p>He said: \"We've shied away from making the case for lower taxes for too long. That's why I'm so happy this week to hear it.\"</p> <p>He also dismissed any calls for a move to the centre to tackle the threat from the Liberal Democrats, saying: \"They operate best in an ideological vacuum. 1979 wiped them out. The way to beat them is for us to know what we stand for.\"</p> <p>Dr Fox also claimed it was \"only in recent months the party has regained its hunger. The biggest change in the last year [since Michael Howard became leader] is the party has become leadable again. We were unleadable since the first day of the 1992 government.\"</p> <p>He also revealed that according to internal Tory party polling, Iraq only came 12th on a list of voters' concerns.</p> <p>Reacting to today's news that Paul Sykes, one of Ukip's major financial backers, had returned to the Tories, the party chairman said: \"We've seen Ukip in their true colours. They are a vehicle intent on destroying the Tory party - it's them or us, and it's not going to be us.</p> <p>\"Last week they were a single issue anti-European party. This week they are now a single issue party - intent on destroying the Tories.\"</p> <p>In the afternoon debate in the conference hall, Mr Yeo reiterated that the Tories would end Labour's \"war on the motorist\".</p> <p>Working to the Tories' theme this week of a \"timetable for action\", he pledged to begin an \"audit\" of all speed cameras within a month of taking office, and to widen some intercity rail bottlenecks, while modernising the worst 20 rail stations in the UK to make them more like airports, with shops and extra parking.</p> <p>Mr Yeo claimed that the transport secretary, Alistair Darling, had been appointed merely to keep transport out of the headlines, but joked it was now time to \"Move over, Darling!\"</p> <p>On the environment, he committed the Tories to making fly tipping an arrestable offence, abolishing the over 30 months rule on British cattle, and - again within the first month of taking power - producing a bill to introduce \"honesty in food labelling\".</p> <p>But he admitted this was not a high-profile pitch, declaring he would persevere \"not to win votes or grab headlines\".</p>",
  "<p>The hottest video-game battle for years is about to commence in stores on both sides of the Pacific. Nintendo, the undisputed champion of portable game consoles, will launch its latest gadget, the Nintendo DS (dual screen), in the United States on November 21, just in time for the Christmas shopping season, when makers can rake in up to half their annual profits. It will be released in Japan on December 2 and in Europe early next year.</p> <p>Normally, the launch would simply underpin Nintendo's dominance of the portable game console market - it controls 95% - but this year it faces its greatest challenge yet from the biggest name in home entertainment: Sony.</p> <p>After months of pre-release hype and speculation, enthusiasts in Japan now have a better idea of what the two gaming giants are offering.</p> <p>Many of the tens of thousands who flocked to the Tokyo Game Show recently made a beeline for the Sony stand for a preview of its rival for gamers' attentions - the PlayStation Portable, the firm's debut hand-held console. According to the pre-launch blurb, the PSP incorporates all the quick response and image quality of the home-use PlayStation 2.</p> <p>Weighing 270g, the shiny black PSP is 170mm long and 74mm wide, with 32 MB of memory. The layout bears some resemblance to the PS2, which is bound to please Sony's huge fan base. But perhaps its biggest selling point is its 4.3-inch screen, which takes up most of the machine's surface and offers razor-sharp graphics.</p> <p>Although game fans in Japan will be able to get their hands on a PSP by late December, those in Europe and the United States will have to wait until next March, a delay that industry insiders say could blunt its impact. In addition, the firm has yet to say how much it will cost.</p> <p>Young Nintendo fans hoping to nag parents into submission this December will be able to tell them exactly how much they will need to budget for. Although the DS will retail for 15,000 yen (\u00a375) - \u00a55,000 more than its current Game Boy Advance PS - that is at the low end of many analysts' predictions. The firm said it had increased its sales target through to the end of March next year from 3.5m units worldwide to 4m.</p> <p>The appetite for existing Nintendo machines appears just as healthy. Yesterday the firm raised its full-year net profit forecast by 20% to \u00a584bn thanks to a strong dollar and better demand for its GameCube console and software for Game Boy Advance.</p> <p>Sony, meanwhile, is expecting to ship 3m PSPs by the end of March 2005.<br></p> <p><strong> Compatibility</strong><br> </p> <p>As usual, Nintendo shunned the game show, but recent publicity shows a chunkier console, in silver or black, with the user-friendly control panel that is the hallmark of its hugely successful Game Boy series.</p> <p>The machine's two screens, one of which is inside the flip-open lid, can be used to view games from different angles and enable pairs of players to challenge each other via a wireless connection. One of the screens is touch-sensitive, allowing up to 16 players to exchange hand-scrawled messages at once. A major plus with prospective buyers will be its compatibility with the 600 or so existing Game Boy titles.</p> <p>Nintendo is the first Japanese game console maker to launch a new gadget abroad rather than in Japan, a move that is seen as a reflection of the growing importance of the booming overseas market.</p> <p>The Japanese video game industry shrank by 10% in 2003 - the third consecutive annual drop - to \u00a51.1trillion amid competition for the youth yen from mobile phones, the internet and DVDs. In 2001 the market was worth \u00a51.5trillion.</p> <p>Sony executives say the PSP is not simply a rival to the DS, but a long overdue addition to the hand-held market. That will probably mean attracting older, better-off gaming enthusiasts with the PSP's sleek finish and video and audio capabilities. The more modestly priced Nintendo DS, on the other hand, is expected to be at the top of many teenagers' Christmas wish-lists.</p> <p>Aside from splitting hairs over hardware pros and cons, users will be just as choosy about the software on offer. That is where Sony thinks it can make inroads with dozens of new titles, adding to a sector that, according to the Tokyo-based Computer Entertainment Suppliers' Associa tion, accounted for 23% of the \u00a5309bn domestic software market in 2003.</p> <p>At the game show in Tokyo, visitors were able to try their hand at 22 games, some of which, like Gran Turismo 4, are mobile versions of PS2 titles.</p> <p>The new machine, however, is not compatible with other PlayStation models. That is a surprising technological shift given that previous PlayStations have been able to handle their predecessors' software, a convenience often cited as a factor in the bigger console's enduring popularity.</p> <p>Then there is the price. Ken Kutaragi, Sony's chief executive, said the firm wanted to gauge reaction at the game show before naming a price. Though a price-tag of about \u00a530,000 - double that of the Nintendo DS - has been touted, Sony officials appear unperturbed. \"We expect PSP to create a new market, helping expand the entire game market,\" Mr Kutaragi said. </p> <p>Sony should also draw strength from its record in breaking into the game console market. Ten years ago its original Play-Station outpaced Nintendo's Famicom family computer, which turned Super Mario and Donkey Kong into household names after it went on sale in 1983.</p> <p>The PS2 has racked up 74m sales since its launch - against 16m for Nintendo's GameCube - making it the most popular console in the world, controlling 47% of the US market and about 80% of the Japanese and European markets.<br></p> <p><strong>Switching loyalties</strong><br> </p> <p>But Sony will do well to pull off a similar feat in the hand-held market in which Nintendo has sold 150m Game Boys since the machine was released in 1989.</p> <p>Analysts are reluctant to forecast a winner at this early stage, but gamers at the Tokyo show last week appeared impressed by Sony's machine.</p> <p>\"The screen is superb and the machine itself is quite compact,\" said Mikio Kato, a 27-year-old who said his fascination with video games began with Nintendo's original Game Boy and who said he was \"almost certain\" he would switch loyalties. Takayoshi Mikami, 24, said he too planned to buy a PSP, although he was not absolutely convinced by Sony's product. \"The screen is nice and big,\" he said, \"but I get the feeling it will be difficult to see everything clearly when playing action games.\"</p> <p>But the computer programmer, a self-confessed simulation-game addict, added: \"People like me will pay more for good graphics and content, so I'm pretty sure I'll be buying a Sony.\"</p> <p>Although some Sony officials have privately voiced concern that the PSP will miss the US Christmas rush, the firm hopes to compensate with the launch of a cut-price, slimmer version of its best-selling PS2 on November 1. In response, Nintendo is to cut the price of its Game Boy Advance SP by 20%.</p> <p>The game console wars, in fact, have already begun.</p>",
  "Much ink has been spilled over John Kerry's smashing victory last week: how Kerry got a new lease on life after being written off for dead. Kerry's situation had never been dire, given the poll numbers in the battleground states (as opposed to the national poll numbers over-reported in the media). But in politics, perception is reality, and Kerry was suffering from a serious perception gap. <p>In 2000, Al Gore notched solid debate performances against Bush. On matters of substance, it was no contest: Gore ran circles around Bush. Regardless, the post-debate consensus was that Bush came across as \"likeable\" while Gore was \"stiff\" and \"arrogant\". And how did we determine which one was likeable and the other stiff? The post-debate spinmeisters told us. </p> <p>After every debate, the campaigns dispatch their surrogates to reporters and television shows to argue that their guy won the debate and the other guy was an embarrassment to humanity. The Bush campaign lackeys were instructed last week to say that \"Kerry's credibility gulf\" had become a \"credibility canyon\". The Democrats argued that Kerry had \"left no doubt he can lead the fight to hunt and kill the terrorists\". </p> <p>Let's be honest: Bush gave Democrats a great deal of material to work with. He rolled his eyes, looked visibly perturbed, tripped over his words, stared off blankly into space more than once, and made bizarre chewing motions with his mouth. At one point, in the middle of answering a question, he yelled out, \"Let me finish!\" even though he had time on the clock and neither Kerry nor the moderator had uttered a sound. </p> <p>On the other hand, Kerry gave Republicans very little ammunition. The GOP had insisted on using a colour-coded lighting system to inform the public when a candidate went over his time limit. Kerry had made a mockery of time limits during the Democratic primary debates, and the GOP planned on using his wordiness to paint him as unable to give a \"straight answer\". Much to their chagrin, Kerry never went over his allotted time. </p> <p>Bloggers, thinktanks, the Kerry campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) all worked to fact-check Bush and point out his bizarre behaviour. The flow of information flowed two ways, as the party establishment and allied organisations worked hand-in-hand with the blogs to gather ammunition, then blast it out to the world. </p> <p>The DNC and bloggers also urged readers and supporters to swamp online polls after the debate, and they did. Hours after the debate, just about every online poll gave Kerry huge victories in the debate. (Ironically, it was conservative activists who pioneered the practice of skewing online polls.) </p> <p>A GOP conference call for activists was hijacked by Democrats after the number of the meeting and the passcode were <a href=\" http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/09/message-from-ed-gillespie.html\">published</a> on liberal blogs like Atrios. One blogger <a href=\" http://jackpinesavage.blogspot.com/2004/10/post-debate.html\">described</a> the scene:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mehlman said Kerry started with a credibility gap and ended with a credibility canyon and babbled in and around this point for five minutes or so. Then they announced that they were going to take three questions. The first was from a \"young Republican in Washington\". She proceeded to say that Kerry was very credible and that she had decided to vote for him. The second caller said she thought Kerry would make a credible commander-in-chief and the third call took Bush to task for not mentioning the al Qaida members not captured. </p> <p>Mehlman apologised to the Bush supporters listening and acknowledged that the call had obviously attracted some Democrats. We had, essentially, hijacked their own spin distribution and thrown it in the GOP's face. </p> </blockquote> <p>In addition to hijacking their spin distribution machine, blogs like my Daily Kos gleefully posted <a href=\" http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/9/30/234853/153\">poor reviews</a> streaming in from conservative blogs and pundits. What better way to prove that it wasn't just liberals claiming Kerry won? The Kerry campaign blasted out the juiciest quotes to their supporters and media lists. The morning after, the <a href=\" http://www.democrats.org/faces/index.html\">DNC</a> and amateur video editors had spliced video of Bush's weird behaviour, distributing their handiwork virally via email, blogs, and personal websites. Republicans did nothing of the sort.</p> <p>The GOP was reduced to lamely tossing out a litany of excuses for Bush's poor behaviour, hoping against hope something would stick to the wall. Conservative bloggers, led by Matt Drudge, even tried to claim video proved Kerry had taken out a cheat sheet from his coat pocket. (It had been a pen, which was probably permissible under the rules.)</p> <p>The GOP's last line of defence - that the debate wouldn't sway any voters - crumbled when new Gallup and Newsweek polls respectively showed eight and nine-point surges by Kerry. And thus ended the most ineffective GOP spin effort in the past four years. </p> <p>The vice-presidential debate is tonight, and the two presidential contenders still have two more debates to go. The Republicans won't be caught flat-footed again neither on the debate floor nor in the post-debate spin rooms. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Markos Moulitsas runs the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com\">dailykos.com</a> US political blog, and <a href=\"http://www.ourcongress.org/\">Our Congress</a>, a blog tracking the hottest congressional races</p> <p>Respond to this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/10/in_a_spin.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, today called for his term in office to be extended if the capital succeeds in its Olympic bid.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone was speaking after an intense hour-long grilling by Conservative London delegates at the Tory party conference in Bournemouth.</p> <p>Speaking of his hopes for a successful Olympic bid following forceful lobbying by a team spearheaded by the Olympic gold medallist and ex-Tory MP Sebastian Coe, Mr Livingstone said that if London won, the mayoral term would need to be extended by a year to ensure thatpreparations for the games were not disrupted.</p> <p>Looking stressed at the end of his annual roasting by Conservative delegates, Mr Livingstone reiterated his ambition to stand for a third term in 2008 to see through his projects to fruition, including hosting the Olympic Games in 2012.</p> <p> Whether or not he was re-elected, the sitting mayor would need the extra leeway to ensure a pending election battle did not distract them from the games.</p> <p>\"If we win the Olympic bid, the mayoral term should be extended to five years because to try and have the run-up to the Olympics in the run-up to the election, the mayor's attention should be totally focused on the games\", he said.</p> <p>This would mean that the mayor elected in 2008 would end his tenure in 2013, a year after the Olympic Games. Mr Livingstone appeared confident such a deal could be made. </p> <p>However, whether he has the nod from the government over this proposal, and whether further legislation would need to be passed to allow the four year term to be exceeded, remain unclear.</p>",
  "<p>EURO VASE ME</p> <p>Just as Morgan Spurlock's brilliant documentary, Super Size Me, offers a damning indictment of the dangers of junk food, so Uefa's bloated new competition, Super Size Euro Vase, should act as a warning about the folly of stuffing a competition few care about with a pointless new group stage. But try telling that to the representatives of Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Rangers and Hearts, who were in Nyon for Uefa's latest money-making wheeze, sorry, group stage draw.</p> <p>An hour later, the speeches had been made, the 40-team, eight-group draw explained, the dust settled - and Middlesbrough's Keith Lamb was rubbing his hands like Del Boy on a January morning. \"The draw is excellent for our fans, it's a great draw for the club,\" he joshed, as he picked the bones of a group containing Lazio, Villarreal, Partizan Belgrade and Egaleo (a tiny Greek team, not a line from Bohemian Rhapsody in case you wondered).</p> <p>Up the road in Newcastle, Freddie Shepherd was equally effusive after seeing his side drawn alongside Sporting Lisbon, Sochaux, Panionios and Dinamo Tbilisi. \"We beat Sporting on the way to winning the Fairs Cup in 1969, who knows what will happen this time,\" he said, as a large pig flew over the Tyne.</p> <p>Meanwhile there were mixed fortunes for the Scottish sides.

The deal will last 15 years and includes eight years' shirt sponsorship - and it's got folks at Arsenal very excited. \"This deal is an amazing opportunity for Arsenal,\" drooled director Keith Edelman, in a new Burger King suit. \"Emirates is a quality airline and [offered us more than enough money to sell out in this fashion].\" And as if his smile wasn't wide enough, Arsene Wenger's been making all the right noises over a two-year contract extension.</p> <p>\"I've said many times that I am committed to Arsenal,\" he insisted, finally spotting the papers on the desk in front of him. \"It is just a question of days when an extension of my contract will be announced.

  "<p>Free CDs attached to your Saturday or Sunday newspapers could become a thing of the past after music retailers issued a stark warning that they would stop stocking artists who appear on the giveaway discs.</p> <p>The stores are furious with record labels and say the giveaway frenzy is seriously damaging CD sales. They claim the record companies are committing \"financial suicide\" through the promotions.</p> <p>The retailers are taking their stand after calculating that more than 10 million CDs, with a market value of over \u00a3100m, were given away during the last weekend in September, four times as many as were sold in the preceding week.</p> <p>Piracy and downloading from computers are already hitting CD sales so the retailers are determined to stop papers such as the Sunday Mirror and Mail on Sunday ruining their businesses further.</p> <p>Two weeks ago the Sun gave away a CD of tracks chosen by columnist Jeremy Clarkson, including Wheatus's Teenage Dirtbag and songs by The Darkness and Stereophonics.</p> <p>Last weekend, the Observer gave away a five-track Libertines CD featuring the band's last two singles.</p> <p>The Star carried a 15-track Back to School CD featuring tracks by The Jam and Rod Stewart, while the Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Mirror regularly give away compilation albums with themes such as love songs and rock anthems.</p> <p>Newspapers have been giving away music for the past five years. There is intense competition to produce the right CD because a successful disk can boost a title's circulation by up to 20%.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday is estimated to have gained 450,000 in extra sales after it ran a Beach Boys CD covermount at the end of last month.</p> <p>One senior newspaper marketing executive said: \"It certainly works for newspapers, the issue is the longevity of sales. If it's not matched to editorial content then people will only dip in rather than stay.</p> <p>\"People are always going to do it but to say that its affecting music sales is erroneous. CD sales may be falling but if you take the contribution of downloads - which you have to - then the total market is up. The music industry has far bigger issues that this.\"</p> <p>The British Association of Record Dealers is joining forces with the Music Managers Forum - an association representing artists' agents - to combat the trend, accusing the labels of \"looking at short-term gains\" instead of focusing on the \"long-term damage\" caused by CD giveaways. </p> <p>Steven Knott, the chairman of Bard, said: \"Bard and MMF are seriously concerned that this practice is spiralling out of control and will have serious long-term effects for the entire industry</p> <p>\"In an era when the industry is fighting falling sales trends and an increasing threat of piracy, why does it insist on engaging in a practice that devalues music in the eyes of consumers and reduces the need for consumers to purchase music when their music quota is filled with free CDs. </p> <p>\"In any other industry, giving away more than you are selling would be called financial suicide.\"</p> <p><strong>Papers give away 23 million CDs in a year</strong><br></p> <p>A 2001 report estimated that more than 23 million CDs were given away in UK publications, representing 10% of the total CD market.</p> <p>The report surveyed 46 record labels and found that nearly two-thirds reported no increase in sales following a covermount campaign.</p> <p>Bard said it had already started to monitor the artists and tracks featured in free CDs so their members could make \"informed\" decisions about what to stock.</p> <p>The retailers are incensed that record labels are giving away classic back-catalogue tracks as well as over-generous samplers from up-and-coming bands.</p> <p>\"It is time the record companies woke up to the long-term damage that these cover-mounts are causing and stopped this practice,\" said Bard. The newspapers, however, appear reluctant to abandon the practice, which can bring in tens of thousands of extra sales.</p> <p>\"If you get it right, you can normally expect an uplift in sales of between 10% and 12%,\" said John Duncan, the managing editor of the Observer.</p> <p>One Saturday newspaper said CD covermounts regularly resulted in extra sales of \"between 15% and 20%\". </p> <p><strong>An expensive habit for publishers</strong><br></p> <p>Newspaper are realising that, like the tabloid bingo wars of the mid-80s, CD covermounts are an increasingly expensive practice but one they are unlikely to give up in an era of declining sales.</p> <p>\"Everybody does it and the more they do, the more expensive it becomes to compete. There's no point doing it if you don't promote and that means a minimum spend of \u00a3250,000 on top of packaging, duplication and publishing rights,\" said one senior weekend newspaper source.</p> <p>\"If you stood back, you wouldn't say it offered value for money.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>When Michael Fielding came out of school at 3.30 in the afternoon, his mother Jackie used to walk him straight home along Beckenham High Road. No going out to kick a ball around, no loitering around the shops. By mid-afternoon, the air around their home, between an arterial road leading out of London and the M25, was thick with diesel fumes. When the weather was hot, Michael, who was asthmatic from a young age, would be coughing, needing his inhaler before he got to the front door; once inside, his mother would shut all the windows. About once every two months, his condition got so bad that she would have to take him to hospital. </p> <p>\"It blighted our lives,\" says Jackie. \"We couldn't go out. Beckenham and Bromley are in a basin, and the smog would settle across the area. Diesel is a big trigger to Michael. On a heavily polluted summer day, it would overwhelm him.\" Although traffic emissions did not cause Michael's asthma, they could bring on attacks. \"It definitely got worse after the M25 was opened,\" says Fielding. \"I ran a support group for people with asthma; the M25 affected a lot of people.\" </p> <p>Five years ago, when her son was nine, Fielding decided to move out of London, to a house on a hill in East Grinstead, Sussex, where there is less diesel traffic and buses only pass once every hour. \"Within six months we saw a difference,\" she says. \"He needed less medication. He can stay out in the evenings now.\" </p> <p>Last week, plans to build a new city academy in west London were re-examined after studies of air quality showed unacceptably high levels of pollution. A report warned that unfiltered air drawn into the school building would cause health problems, particularly for children with asthma. After a review, the project was given the go-ahead. \"The air quality is fairly dreadful in Westminster as a whole,\" said a council spokeswoman, \"so none of the other sites would be better - in fact, one of the proposed sites would be worse.\" </p> <p>The site of the new academy is just off the busy A40, which has a long elevated section over a densely populated area of west London. Levels of nitrogen dioxide and airborne particulates were found to be far in excess of proposed European limits. If officials were concerned that pupils at the proposed academy would be poisoned by the air, how is it affecting local residents, who are already breathing it? And how many of us live in an area of high pollution without knowing it? </p> <p>The major cause of pollution in cities is traffic. Exhaust fumes contain high levels of nitrogen dioxide, which can irritate the lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as flu, particularly in the elderly and those already suffering from asthma. Children exposed to high levels of nitrogen dioxide over a long period are more likely to develop respiratory illnesses. Airborne particles are also released in clouds of exhaust, especially from diesel engines. The finer particles can be carried deep into the lungs where they cause inflammation; they may also carry carcinogenic compounds into the lungs, and exacerbate problems for people already suffering from heart and lung diseases. If your health is good, according to Defra, the levels of air pollution usually experienced in the UK are \"unlikely to have any serious short-term effects\". The damp and windy conditions we are used to in the UK do help dissipate air pollution. But when it's hot and sunny and air pollution levels are high, you may get red and itchy eyes, or start to cough, and find that breathing deeply hurts. </p> <p>If you suspect that you are living in a pollution sink, you can find out the levels of the major pollutants where you live. The government has made great efforts to monitor air quality in all areas; local authorities are obliged to carry out tests and own up if they are unable to meet pollution targets. If they fail the test, they become \"air quality management areas\" and have to come up with measures to reduce the problem. To date, 125 local authorities in the UK (most of Northern Ireland has yet to report) have declared excessive levels of pollutants. </p> <p>To discover what the air is like in your neighbourhood, go to the Local Air Quality Archive (<a href=\"http://www.airquality.co.uk\">www.airquality.co.uk</a>), where you will find a map with blue blotches marking areas with pollution problems. You can not only find out whether your borough is performing badly, but, if you can understand them, you can also read tables showing levels of specific pollutants over an extended period. </p> <p>But asthma sufferer Alison Bottomley, 52, is not impressed. She lives in Nottingham, and, when conditions conspire, her allergies can be disabling. \"On humid days I might as well give up,\" she says. \"Standing at the bus station I'm coughing and wheezing all over the place. I used to be a marathon runner, but I had to go down to half-marathons. Last time I ran I was a bit poorly; I couldn't even train for one now.\" </p> <p>Bottomley works in the city centre, at the museum. Since she has to catch a bus on a busy road, she checks the forecast levels of air pollution on Ceefax before leaving the house. \"The pollution from traffic has got much worse - you can almost taste it. And the forecast says 'low', so where are they putting the monitoring stations? They don't put them where you get the vehicles. There's one I know of in the city centre, in a pedestrian area.\" </p> <p>If you want to find out the pollution levels in your street, you may have to measure them yourself. There are just two monitoring sites in my London borough. When I contacted my local authority to find out air quality measurements outside my children's school, I received the following reply: \"It is not practical to measure air pollution concentrations at more than a small number of locations due to the high cost of the equipment and the resources required to gather and analyse the data. It is normal practice to use computer modelling to predict the likely pollution concentrations at points where no monitoring is being carried out.\" </p> <p>If you're thinking of moving house and air quality is an issue, Local Air Quality Archive maps will help you establish no-go areas for asthmatics, and initiatives to reduce congestion may help city dwellers breathe easier, but we are still in the early stages. \"The London congestion charge has been a useful experiment,\" says Tim Williamson at the National Society for Clean Air (NSCA), \"but pollutants outside the congestion charge area mean there is no immediate improvement. On the other hand, we are not seeing a lot of displaced traffic, so the result of the initiative has been to suppress demand.\" </p> <p>Outside city centres, Friends of the Earth point out that areas around airports, in particular Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Birmingham, are polluted not only by aircraft but also increased road traffic to the terminals. \"Air pollution around airports has a serious impact on people's health,\" says Richard Dyer at FoE. \"Thanks to both aircraft and vehicle pollution, people living near Heathrow are already breathing air that breaches the proposed EU health limits.\" FoE also reports that clusters of factories in areas including Middlesborough, Cardiff and Southampton spew out cancer-causing chemicals into the air; the website (<a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk)\">www.foe.co.uk)</a> has a map showing concentrations of polluting factories. </p> <p>Tony Bosworth of FoE suggests that air pollution linked to vehicle emissions drops off the further you move away from a main road; carbon monoxide, in particular, is extremely localised - it can be much higher, for example, on one side of the road than on the other. So should people who are vulnerable to respiratory problems just get out of town? </p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not as simple as that. Many factors cause allergies and breathing difficulties, not least of which is pollen, a decidedly rural phenomenon. There is also ozone, or smog, which occurs in suburbs and rural areas. It is caused by pollutants carried on the prevailing wind, reacting with sunlight - in the long term, there is no way of calculating which way they will go. In the heatwave of 1993, according to Bosworth, the worst areas for ozone were rural Somerset and Oxfordshire, and the Scottish Highlands. \"It is quite probable,\" says Bosworth, \"that people are breathing unacceptable levels of pollutants all over the UK.\" </p> <p>So however much you try to avoid sources of pollution, as so often, living in Britain, you may just be beaten by the weather. </p> <p><strong> A pollution checklist</strong></p> <p><strong> Most polluted areas</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cities/towns in deep valleys </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anywhere in sunny, still weather </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cold, still, foggy weather is bad for vehicle pollutants in large cities </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Busy roads with heavy traffic next to high buildings and busy road junctions </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> High levels of solid fuel, eg coal and wood, used for heating </p> <p><strong> Least polluted areas</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cities/towns on hills </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anywhere in windy or wet weather </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rural areas away from major roads and factories (for most pollutants except ozone) </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Residential roads with light traffic </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Smoke control area or areas with high levels of gas or electric heating </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Source: Defra </p> <p> <strong> And what it does to you ...</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Respiratory disease </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Small particulates in exhaust fumes and factory emissions have been linked to reductions in lung function and respiratory problems </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ozone is a toxic gas: can cause eye and throat irritation, and damage to lung tissue </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide in exhaust fumes aggravate respiratory problems </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Airborne particles can cause pulmonary inflammation </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Volatile organic compounds, including benzene and butadeine, are released in vehicle exhaust, solvents and motor fuels.

  "<p>It started with a niggling pain in his back. Simon, a 38-year-old advertising executive, thought he'd twisted it playing tennis, but when it didn't go away he went to see his GP. Two weeks later he was diagnosed with cancer of the spine. This story is made up, but most of us will know one like it. Someone youngish, fit and well whose seemingly trivial health problem turns out to be a life-threatening disease. Someone, as we get older, who is a relative or friend. Suddenly that cough we've had for a week seems more sinister, that headache worse than before. How can we know whether to take a symptom seriously or not? Should we go to the GP or shrug it off? </p> <p>\"There are many people who feel they need to go to the doctor just in case,\" says Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, a consultant psychiatrist in a private practice in London. \"Up to 50% of people visiting outpatient clinics are having needless investigations.\" </p> <p>These investigations are ordered by doctors also worried that they might miss the early signs of serious diseases. The health service encourages us to catch the signs of cancer and heart disease early. Screening programmes test us for diseases before we even have symptoms. Is it possible that we are getting too worried about our health? </p> <p>\"Our general level of anxiety and concern is on the increase,\" says Dr Adrian Edwards, a reader in primary care at the University of Swansea and a researcher in how people understand risk. \"As we get older we have an increased realisation of our vulnerability. When we have examples close to home of friends or relatives who get ill or die, they have a high impact. People's responses can be different, depending on their personality type. Psychologists use the terms \"monitors\" and \"blunters\". Monitors become terribly interested in all the details of the illness; they get anxious and try to reduce their own risk of getting ill, almost paying excessive attention to their health. Blunters block it out and pretend nothing like that will happen to them. If you worry too much, you should worry less. If you're a blunter, you may worry too little.\" </p> <p>Angela Jones is a 36-year-old secretary in London who knows she worries too much about her health. \"I worry that things I can't see inside my body are happening to me,\" she says. \"I worry about getting breast cancer and that my arteries are furring up. I've heard there's a scan that can see inside your arteries and I'd like to have one. I try to do things like eating salads, going to the gym, things that are within my control, to stop myself getting sick. I'm an anxious person anyway but I get fixated by specific conditions. My friend's mother died of breast cancer when I was 18. Life suddenly seems much shorter when you get over 30. You used to think you had an endless amount of time being well before. </p> <p>\"Also, when you see other people's loss, it makes you aware of how awful it is - how sad it makes you. You worry about something happening to you and other people being upset by it. Lots of my women friends get more anxious about their healthafter having children because they worry about how their children would cope without them.\" </p> <p>Dr James Hawkins, a psychiatrist at the Good Medicine charity in Edinburgh, believes that it's a combination of genetic factors and personal life experiences that determine how anxious people get about their health. \"If your early childhood experience was that every time you got ill your parents rushed you off to the doctors, you are more likely to be anxious about your health. If you know someone who was reassured by their doctor and told everything was OK and they turned out to have cancer, you are unlikely to be easily reassured yourself. You may think it's another example of doctors giving wrong reassurances. There is a tendency for women to be more anxious about their health but I have seen both men and women contorted by health anxiety. </p> <p>\"It can be difficult for people to work out what is reasonable to worry about with their health. When other health professionals ask me when they should take symptoms seriously, I tell them to ask themselves if they would still refer the patient if the patient had the same symptoms but their anxiety was taken away,\" he says. \"All of us at times worry about funny things in our body going wrong - we'd be brain-dead if we didn't. But if you worry about your health all the time, you need to ask yourself if you have a track record for worrying about things that usually amount to nothing. If you go to see the GP quite often, maybe you are more consumed by your health than other people. Maybe you should ask yourself if you really need to see your GP when you start worrying about a health problem. But it is hard to be clear-cut on what you should and shouldn't worry about.\" </p> <p>Reassuring people who are worried about their symptoms is often not helpful, says Hawkins. \"It's certainly no good saying it's all in your head. People crave understanding; they want an explanation that fits the facts.\" </p> <p>Dr David Tovey, a former GP who is now deputy editor of Clinical Evidence, a digest of research evidence, believes that reassurance almost never reassures. \"The worst thing is if you reassure someone about a condition they haven't mentioned,\" he says. \"Then they may worry about that as well. You have to take patients' health fears very seriously. You have to find out the reasons why they think they have something; maybe their neighbour had it, or they read about it in a book, and offer a plausible alternative.\" </p> <p>For most of us, that niggle in the back is likely to be just that - something muscular that goes away of its own accord. Life expectancy in the UK is 80 years for women and 76 years for men. These figures are for babies born now, rather than adults born four decades ago, but most of us will collect our pensions. Edwards says that three out of four people live to at least 65. One of the problems that people have, he says, is understanding their risk of getting ill, especially from rare diseases. \"People got very worried about Sars, but many more people die from diarrhoea around the world,\" he says. \"People's attitude to risk is determined by how common the risk is, whether it is controllable, and how dreadful it is. People see cancer as much more dreadful than heart disease. It's natural to feel vulnerable and to feel the implications for other people if something happened to you, but we need to keep the size of risks in proportion.\" </p> <p>There is no clear set of symptoms that people should worry about any more than there are guaranteed signs of being well. \"People can do things to help themselves like stopping smoking, eating fruit and vegetables, drinking less alcohol and exercising,\" says Hawkins. \"These do reduce the risk of cancer.\" </p> <p>But the main thing people need to do is to get over their health anxieties and start enjoying life. \"Some people worry about dying in our 30s,\" says Hallstrom. \"Others banish it from their minds. Then, suddenly, when something happens to someone you know, you are forced to contemplate your own mortality and it comes as a shock to you. Then for normal people mental mechanisms kick in so they don't think about it all the time. The healthy way of dealing with it is to realise you have no choice and to make the best of what you have. Live the life you enjoy living. </p> <p>\"Avoid doctors if you possibly can unless you have to. Don't be preoccupied with your health and avoid the sick role even when you are sick. Some people go to work with a cold, other take two weeks off. It's not the illness you have, but the impact it has on you.\" </p> <p>And if you can't stop worrying about the illnesses you could get as you grow older, you can do something that a colleague of mine once did. He pinned up a list of all the diseases he was now too old to get. </p> <p>If you think you might be worrying about your health more than you should, check how many of the following statements apply to you: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hearing about Tony Blair's heart problem had you reaching for your own pulse </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You repeatedly become obsessed about some aspect of your health - a funny feeling in your leg, for example, or a twitch in your eye that gets no worse and eventually goes away </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You are visiting your GP often, and finding that he or she is much less concerned than you are about your symptoms </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Whenever you find out that a neighbour has a life-threatening illness, you are strangely keen to find out all the grisly details </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Your bathroom cabinet is filled to overflowing with all sorts of creams, pastes and pills, most of which you never use </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Your Family Health Encyclopaedia is the best-thumbed book on your bedside table. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You're reading the New England Journal of Medicine rather than watching Green Wing </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> When talking with friends, you find the conversation invariably turns to the subject of you and your health </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You always think you've got the condition that is being written about in your newspaper's health pages</p>",
  "<p>As morning breaks over his mansion in the Hollywood Hills, I suspect that Morrissey is greeting the day with an even gloomier countenance than usual. He won't be the only one. This morning, a similar atmosphere of despair may well be circulating around the homes of artists as diverse as Dido, the Scissor Sisters, Jarvis Cocker and Meat Loaf. All face the prospect of conducting the remainder of their lives under an appalling blight: the Curse of the Thrashing Doves. </p> <p>Named after the hotly tipped 1980s band whose career evaporated when Margaret Thatcher said she liked their video on Saturday Superstore, the Curse of the Thrashing Doves afflicts rock and pop stars when a politician declares a love for their music. Its death-dealing effects have been noted frequently in recent years: Oasis never made a decent record after Noel Gallagher visited number 10. And there was the case of Ezio, a folk outfit destined for big things until Tony Blair sealed their doom by selecting an Ezio track on Desert Island Discs. </p> <p>Last weekend, the Conservative Party announced the contents of a series of lighthearted talking-head interviews with MPs, to be shown during this week's party conference. The intention was to be \"intimate and engaging\"; the reality is a series of potentially fatal blows to some of the biggest names in rock and pop. </p> <p>Do the Scissor Sisters seem so outr\u00e9 and daring now that you know Tory co-chairman Dr Liam Fox is a fan? How cool can the Smiths, Pulp and Radiohead be if policy co-ordinator David Cameron likes them? Will the last tattered vestiges of Dido's credibility be blown away by Nicholas Soames' love of her music? And what of Meat Loaf - is it now impossible to think of him without picturing shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram capering around to Paradise by the Dashboard Light? </p> <p>In their defence, you can see what the Tories are trying to do. Even in today's allegedly homogenous pop culture, the music you like sends out a message about who you are. The gulf between what you assume that message is and how others perceive it is often vast, however. Soames may think that liking multi million-selling Dido suggests he is a man of the people, blessed with populist taste. But liking anything that innocuous could suggest you loathe pop music, preferring it to waft delicately in the background rather than risk it moving you in any way. </p> <p>As every student knows, a liking for the Smiths, Radiohead and Pulp can be a badge of pride, confirmation of your status as a romantic intellectual loner. If you're a Tory MP, however, it rather suggests that you're either not listening to the lyrics properly - what do you make of all that stuff about class resentment - or view listening to music as a slightly disturbing form of self-flagellation. </p> <p>Ultimately, however, all perceptions of what musical taste says about any given MP are overridden by one simple truth. The reason the Curse of the Thrashing Doves exists is not because pop and politics don't mix - it is because pop and politicians don't mix. Thinking about a politician listening to rock music is like imagining your parents having sex: you not only lose all respect for them, it puts you off the whole concept. </p> <p>Even when a politician displays the kind of refined taste that indicates a deep love for rock music, the effect is negative. The news that defence secretary Geoff Hoon knows enough about the Beach Boys' mid-60s career to comment on the recent release of Brian Wilson's lost masterpiece, Smile, may inspire fleeting respect. But this is quickly replaced by thoughts of a more damning nature, chiefly: doesn't he have something more important to do with his time than pontificate about the merits of classic psychedelia? </p> <p>I can't help but wish the current Tory party would take inspiration from their predecessors in the Thatcher government, who knew better than to dabble in the murky waters of rock and pop. Thatcher may have appeared on Saturday Superstore, but once she was there, she didn't attempt the impossible task of proving how groovy she was: she liked the Thrashing Doves not because of their music, but because their video featured an adorable piglet. Equally, when interviewed by Smash Hits in the mid-80s, she didn't try to court the youth vote by pretending to like Dr and the Medics. Instead, she said her favourite single was Lita Roza's 1953 smash, How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?, thus underlining both her image as a stentorian bastion of conservatism and her all-consuming interest in free-market economics. </p> <p>In David Mellor, meanwhile, the Thatcher government could boast an arts minister so distant from popular culture that when asked to name his favourite track on Sergeant Pepper, he replied: \"Submarine.\" He may have sounded clueless, but at least you didn't have to worry that you might bump into him at Glastonbury.</p>",
  "<p>An academic and a technician were taken to hospital today following a chemical spill in a laboratory at Queen's University in Belfast.</p> <p>The university's full evacuation procedures were activated at approximately 8.30am after a member of staff dropped a container of bromine in the pharmacy building on the Belfast city hospital site. </p> <p>According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, bromine is a poisonous, deep red, oily liquid with a sharp smell that and can cause burns to the skin. </p> <p>A university spokesperson described the incident as \"simple human error\" and that in some cases it was classified in terms of strength alongside bleach and could also be found in some secondary school laboratories. </p> <p>All staff were evacuated and police diverted traffic away from the Lisburn Road entrance to the university.</p> <p>Both the academic and the senior technician involved were discharged from hospital after a thorough examination this morning, and the university building was returned from the emergency services to the university's control at approximately 1pm.</p> <p>The university has launched a full investigation into the spill.</p> <p>Professor Sean Gorman, the head of the school of pharmacy, said: \"The school's incident procedures were put into practice effectively, and a review will be carried out.\"</p> <p>He added: \"As a large school of pharmacy there's a wide range of chemicals on the premises.\"</p> <p>The building will remain closed to students today and be inspected at 8.30am tomorrow to ensure it is safe for lessons to go ahead.</p>",

  "<p>I was born and grew up in South Wales.</p> <p>As you may have heard, we've just been left off the new EU map.</p> <p>I know people in Brussels feel strongly about Neil Kinnock, but I really do think that is going too far.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to go to a very good grammar school.</p> <p>The first political meeting I ever went to was during a general election campaign. It was held by the local Labour Member of Parliament - a great man of his day, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p> <p>I asked him why Labour wanted to abolish grammar schools.</p> <p>And he replied: \"We don't want to abolish grammar schools. We want to make all schools grammar schools\".</p> <p>It was my first experience of a politician's answer.</p> <p>I don't believe in that kind of talk. </p> <p>I'm going to give it to you straight.</p> <p><strong>Rebuilding trust</strong></p> <p>Politicians - all politicians - have made promises they have failed to keep.</p> <p>In 1992 we promised to cut taxes year on year.</p> <p>But we put them up.</p> <p>In 1997 Labour said there would be no tax increases at all.</p> <p>They put them up.</p> <p>Not once, not twice but sixty six times.</p> <p>Sixty six broken promises.</p> <p>And people have been let down on Europe too.</p> <p>In the 1970s, Britain joined a common market. That's what the British people voted for.</p> <p>But it soon became clear our European partners wanted more. </p> <p>They wanted to build a country called Europe.</p> <p>The British people were told: \"Don't worry. France and Germany don't really want a country called Europe. They're coming our way.\"</p> <p>But they haven't come our way. </p> <p>Power has gone from Britain to Brussels. And that's not what the British people voted for.</p> <p>Let's face facts. What has happened on tax and on Europe has damaged people's faith in politics.</p> <p>So it's hardly surprising that people don't trust politicians today. </p> <p><strong>Accountability</strong></p> <p>In the real world, if you say you're going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you can lose your job. </p> <p>It's called accountability.</p> <p>Remember that word - accountability.</p> <p>But politicians seem to live in a different world. </p> <p>A world where promises are dropped just as casually as they're made. </p> <p>A world where the figures are fiddled. </p> <p>A world where there are no penalties for failure. </p> <p>What people want from their politicians is: Accountability. Responsibility. And a little humility.</p> <p>The very opposite of what we've had from Tony Blair.</p> <p>Politicians don't have all the solutions. </p> <p>They should stop pretending they do. </p> <p>So I won't pretend I can solve every problem, right every wrong or cure every ill. </p> <p>I'll leave that to the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>We will only promise what we can deliver. </p> <p>What we start, we will follow through.</p> <p>And we will give people clear measures against which we can be judged. </p> <p>That's why we're setting out a clear Timetable for Action.</p> <p>What we'll do. When we'll do it. Specific times, specific dates. </p> <p>It will put us on the line in a way that no government has ever been before. </p> <p>There will be no wiggle room.</p> <p>Everyone will be able to hold us to account.</p> <p>No dodgy facts and figures. </p> <p>We'll have no place to hide.</p> <p>Accountability.</p> <p>I'll choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver.</p> <p>And if they don't, I'll replace them with people who will.</p> <p>When you ask for people's votes, you have a responsibility to them.</p> <p>Casting a vote shouldn't be a mechanical choice between the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>It should be an opportunity to tell the world what sort of country you want.</p> <p>That's why politicians have a duty to respond to people's dreams and help make them a reality.</p> <p>It's not a crime to want a better school for your child, better healthcare for your mother, and a better life for your family.</p> <p>But it is criminal when politicians hold out these promises without a detailed, deliverable plan.</p> <p>People are fed up with talk. They want action.</p> <p><strong>Talk not action</strong></p> <p>Tony Blair has been all talk.</p> <p>He gets swept away with his rhetoric and his dreams.</p> <p>He's told us about the Euro being our \"destiny\".</p> <p>Well, you know, most people don't actually want a date with destiny. </p> <p>They just want a date with a dentist.</p> <p>Tony Blair has promised so much, but he has delivered so little. </p> <p>That's why people have come to think the problems we face are just like the British weather - something you moan about but cannot change.</p> <p>But we can get a grip on these problems. </p> <p>Where there is cynicism, we can bring hope.</p> <p>I'm not going to promise you a fantasy land.</p> <p>But I do want to take you to a foreign land.</p> <p>In France, they don't have waiting lists.</p> <p>In Sweden, parents can choose the school they want.</p> <p>And in New York, it's now criminals who walk in fear, not the public.</p> <p>I want Britain to be the country that is the envy of the world. And I know that this is the party that can make it happen.</p> <p>Because we instinctively trust the generosity, the initiative and the common sense of the British people.</p> <p><strong>Action on crime</strong></p> <p>And the first problem I'll get a grip on is crime.</p> <p>The gloves will come off.</p> <p>What Giuliani did in New York, what Ray Mallon did in Middlesbrough, we'll do for the whole of Britain. </p> <p>A war on crime.</p> <p>Three weeks ago, on a Saturday night, I went out on the streets of Brixton with people from local churches.</p> <p>I saw the problems their community is up against. </p> <p>In two hours we didn't meet a single policeman.</p> <p>Not one.</p> <p>This was inner city London, just before midnight, on a Saturday night. </p> <p>No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote. </p> <p>The problem is that the police are handcuffed by paperwork. They now have to spend almost as much time at the station as they do out on the streets.</p> <p>And now this Government is making it worse. </p> <p>The police will now have to fill in a form every time they stop someone. Not stop and search. Just stop someone.</p> <p>It takes seven minutes to complete that form. </p> <p>Just think about it. If a police officer stops half a dozen unruly youngsters, he'll have to spend the best part of an hour filling in forms. </p> <p>I don't want police filling in forms. I want them on the streets doing their job. </p> <p>People are fed up that when the police do catch criminals the punishment never seems to fit the crime.</p> <p>Under a new Labour law, shoplifters will only get a fixed penalty fine and no criminal record. Theft is now no worse than parking on a yellow line.</p> <p>I promise you I'm not making this up. </p> <p>And five years ago, Labour introduced an early release scheme. Since then 3,600 crimes - including rape - have been committed by criminals let out of prison early. Every one of those crimes could have been prevented.</p> <p>All this has to change.</p> <p>We need a government that will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. A government that will put their rights first.</p> <p>This is what David Davis will do.</p> <p>Day One. That form police officers will have to fill in every time they stop someone - that form will go into the appropriate filing tray. The bin.</p> <p>Week One. Labour's early release scheme - that will go. </p> <p>Month One. We'll start to recruit 5,000 more police officers a year.</p> <p>And we'll do something else. </p> <p>Career criminals and dangerous offenders should be in prison - not roaming our streets. </p> <p>So we will build more prisons.</p> <p><strong>Action on drugs</strong></p> <p>Everyone knows that drugs are at the root of a lot of crime. </p> <p>There can be few families not touched by the blight or worry of drugs.</p> <p>It's every parent's worst nightmare.</p> <p>I want to give hope and practical support to those families.</p> <p>Many addicts fall into crime to feed their habits.</p> <p>If they're caught, I think they should be given a choice. </p> <p>Prison or treatment.</p> <p>So we'll increase the number of rehab places ten fold - from 2,000 to 20,000.</p> <p>We must give families the chance to win back their children from drugs. </p> <p>Life is far too precious to be written off.</p> <p>Action on school discipline</p> <p>Drugs are a symptom of a wider problem.</p> <p>As a society, we've blurred the distinction between right and wrong. </p> <p>We've tolerated a slow but relentless decline in personal responsibility. </p> <p>Too many people now believe that they are no longer responsible for their actions. </p> <p>It's always someone else's fault.</p> <p>And while we've let responsibility decline, we've allowed \"rights\" to proliferate. You hear it all the time: \"I've got my rights\". The verbal equivalent of two-fingers to authority. </p> <p>The Human Rights Act has tipped the balance of justice away from the victim in favour of the troublemaker.</p> <p>That's why we're reviewing it. And if it can't be reformed, we'll get rid of it.</p> <p>We have also undermined discipline in schools. </p> <p>Too often teachers find their authority challenged when they discipline children.</p> <p>But teachers know their pupils. They know their names and they understand their character - what they are good at and what they find difficult. And we should trust them to exercise their common sense and judgement. </p> <p>So on day one, Tim Collins will start to give head teachers control over their classrooms. They'll have the final say on expulsions. Disruptive pupils won't be able to wreck other children's education.</p> <p><strong>Action on schools and hospitals</strong></p> <p>Hard working families want to restore respect and decent values. </p> <p>But they also want value for money for the taxes they pay.</p> <p>Billions of pounds of their money have been spent on education. But much of it has been wasted on bureaucracy.</p> <p>Twelve pages of government paperwork land on head teachers' desks every single day of the school year.</p> <p>And what do we have to show for it? </p> <p>A third of all eleven year olds still cannot write properly.</p> <p>Billions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been spent on the NHS. And what have we got to show for that? </p> <p>Bureaucrats, people waiting in pain for operations, dirty hospitals.</p> <p>More people die every year from hospital infections than are killed on Britain's roads.</p> <p>That's more than a statistic. </p> <p>It's a tragedy for thousands of families - including mine. </p> <p>Two years ago my mother-in-law died from a hospital acquired infection. </p> <p>Yes she was old. </p> <p>Yes she was frail. </p> <p>But she still enjoyed life. </p> <p>She need not have died. </p> <p>Britain needs a Government that will give hard working families value for the taxes they pay.</p> <p>And what greater value can there be than the dedication of those who work in our schools and hospitals?</p> <p>Look at the astonishing devotion to duty of our doctors and nurses. Their motives are the highest, their skills immense, their energy an inspiration.</p> <p>Think of the commitment of our teachers. Teaching is a noble profession. Teachers simply want the satisfaction - the sheer joy - of inspiring the next generation, and of passing on that most precious commodity, knowledge.</p> <p>Is it too much to ask that we trust their judgement, their experience and their expertise?</p> <p>Let's set them free to follow their vocation, and give of their best. </p> <p>So in week one, Andrew Lansley and Tim Collins will start to scrap Whitehall targets for hospitals and schools. </p> <p>Teachers will run our schools. </p> <p>And doctors and nurses will run our hospitals. </p> <p>We'll trust patients and parents too - so they can choose the hospital and school which best suits them and their family.</p> <p>No-one should have to shut up and just take what they're given.</p> <p>Conservatives will give everyone the kind of choice in health and education that today only money can buy.</p> <p>That's what I call social justice.</p> <p>There are people in Britain who have to wait months for operations on the NHS. Not far from where they live, other more fortunate people only have to wait weeks.</p> <p>We've all paid for the NHS.</p> <p>It's our NHS.</p> <p>So why shouldn't you be able to go to the hospitals that can treat you more quickly? </p> <p>With the Conservatives, you will.</p> <p>We'll also give more choice to parents.</p> <p>Parents know better than anyone what is best for their children. </p> <p>If we want selection, if we want school uniforms, if we want schools that excel at sport, as parents we should be able to choose them. </p> <p>That is the way to give parents the good local schools we all want.</p> <p>But giving parents and patients choice, and giving professionals more control, means cutting back on the pen pushers who run too much of our lives.</p> <p>On day one, Oliver Letwin will freeze civil service recruitment. And I'll do my bit too.</p> <p>In Downing Street there's something called the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit. </p> <p>Yes, the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit. Now there's a contradiction in terms.</p> <p>That Delivery Unit was recently advertising for jobs. </p> <p>Job Title: Joint Action Leaders.</p> <p>Joint Action Leaders.</p> <p>What on earth does that mean?</p> <p>What do these people actually do?</p> <p>I've got the ad here.</p> <p>Let me read it to you.</p> <p>Applicants \"need a track record of diagnosing, analysing and developing workable solutions to key blockages to public service delivery\". </p> <p>Well that's clear then. It's Dyno Rod in Downing Street.</p> <p>And for key blockages, read Gordon Brown.</p> <p>These Joint Action Leaders are paid \u00a370,000 a year each - much more than an experienced midwife gets in a real delivery unit bringing babies into the world. </p> <p>In week one of a Conservative Government, I will order the closure of the Downing Street Delivery Unit. </p> <p>It may not be the biggest waste of money in Whitehall. But it sums up what's going wrong. Tony Blair's got a Delivery Unit - but there's no delivery.</p> <p>I won't have a Delivery Unit - but I will deliver.</p> <p><strong>Action on pensions</strong></p> <p>I will deliver for pensioners.</p> <p>If you want to know about a family, look at how they treat their older relatives. </p> <p>And if you want to know about a country, look how it cares for older people.</p> <p>It's a scandal that this Government took the best pensions system in Europe and turned it into one of the worst.</p> <p>Can you imagine what it feels like to have saved for your retirement only to find that the money you've put aside isn't there? That the value of your pension has been destroyed by Gordon Brown's stealth taxes? </p> <p>How are pensioners on fixed incomes meant to cope with an ever increasing Council Tax?</p> <p>And what a way to treat people who have worked hard and saved all their lives - to make them fill in a twelve page means test form to get what they are due.</p> <p>I want to live in a country where we honour our older generations, cherish their wisdom and care for their needs.</p> <p>A country where they can live out their days in security and with dignity. </p> <p>Respected. </p> <p>Protected. </p> <p>To those who have given so much, we must surely give more.</p> <p>That is why in our first month David Willetts will take steps to restore the link between pensions and earnings. There'll be an extra \u00a37 a week if you live on your own, and an extra \u00a311 a week for a couple.</p> <p>We need a Government which gives pensioners back their dignity.</p> <p>That's what most people want. But only a Conservative Government will deliver it. So my message to you is simple. If you want to give pensioners back their dignity, whatever party you are from, come and join us.</p> <p><strong>Action on tax</strong></p> <p>But pensioners are not the only ones who have been let down. </p> <p>Everyone's been let down by Labour on tax. </p> <p>I want to help those who want to get on in life. The family with a new baby who need a bigger home. The couple who both work, but still don't seem able to make ends meet. </p> <p>Today they are all paying the price of a government that is taxing too much. </p> <p>Young couples, wanting to buy their first home, face hundreds of pounds of Stamp Duty.</p> <p>The poorest households shoulder the highest burden.</p> <p>And teachers, doctors and policemen now pay top rate Income Tax. </p> <p>People who bought their council houses in the 1980s are now being clobbered by Inheritance Tax.</p> <p>This is all wrong. It's unfair.</p> <p>And there's more trouble ahead. </p> <p>Whatever the uncertainty about Tony Blair's future, one thing is certain. If Labour were to win again, we'd have Blair's third term tax rises. </p> <p>And they'd be painful indeed. Council Tax for the typical family of \u00a32,000 a year.</p> <p>Conservatives will stop Blair's third term tax rises dead in their tracks. </p> <p>We'll get a grip on public spending.</p> <p>We'll save billions of pounds by cutting government waste.</p> <p>And that will help to put us back on the path to lower taxes. </p> <p>People work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of it.</p> <p>Families know better than any government can how best to spend their money.</p> <p>So be in no doubt.</p> <p>When I can, I will cut taxes.</p> <p>This week we have set out the taxes we have in our sights - the taxes I want to make fairer, simpler, lower.</p> <p>But I'm not like Tony Blair. I'm not going to make promises I can't keep. </p> <p>I don't want you to leave this hall today with a false prospectus. </p> <p>We must be honest with the British people. </p> <p>It's that word again - accountability.</p> <p><strong>Action on Europe</strong></p> <p>I want to be accountable on Europe too. </p> <p>On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the Constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October.</p> <p>Europe isn't working properly today and the Constitution will only make matters worse.</p> <p>The European Union is spewing out too many regulations. It's holding our economy back. </p> <p>We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline.</p> <p>We need a new approach to Europe.</p> <p>Let me explain why.</p> <p>The British people don't want to be part of a European super state. But other European governments are determined to press ahead with ever closer integration. Britain has tried to stop them. </p> <p>So all we get are arguments and bust ups. Everyone feels frustrated.</p> <p>It's not a terribly clever policy.</p> <p>This is what I will do.</p> <p>Some of our European partners want to integrate further. I'll say to them - \"fine. Britain will no longer try and stop you. But we must have something in return. We want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain\".</p> <p>It is not enough to say No to the European Constitution - though a Conservative Government will.</p> <p>It is not enough to say No to the Euro - though a Conservative Government will.</p> <p>It's time we went further.</p> <p>We want out of the social chapter, which is a threat to British jobs.</p> <p>We want out of the common fisheries policy, which is destroying communities.</p> <p>And we want more British aid to be distributed from London and less from Brussels. It's time to bring powers back to Britain.</p> <p>There's a word for it - accountability.</p> <p>That's what most people want. </p> <p>But only a Conservative Government can deliver it. </p> <p>So my message to you is simple. </p> <p>If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you're from, come and join us. </p> <p><strong>Action on immigration</strong></p> <p>The British people are open, generous and compassionate. </p> <p>We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to people fleeing persecution, and welcoming families who want to settle here and work. </p> <p>We have a long tradition of firm but fair immigration controls. </p> <p>But today, immigration is chaotic and out of control. </p> <p>Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country.</p> <p>And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent.</p> <p>All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused.</p> <p>And they are increasingly concerned about the impact of immigration on our public services - our schools, hospitals and transport. </p> <p>But that's hardly surprising. </p> <p>Immigration has doubled under Labour. </p> <p>And we have a Home Secretary who believes that there is \"no obvious upper limit to legal immigration\".</p> <p>I think we've reached a turning point.</p> <p>We cannot allow unlimited immigration to Britain to continue.</p> <p>We need a Government that gets a grip on this shambles. </p> <p>A government which helps genuine refugees. </p> <p>A government that gives priority to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our country.</p> <p>So in week one, Michael Ancram will signal Britain's intention to pull out of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. We want asylum cases to be decided more quickly and more fairly. We want to allow genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue.</p> <p>That's what I call fair.</p> <p>And in month one, we'll set out plans to enable Parliament to put an annual limit on the number of people who come to Britain. </p> <p>No Conservative Home Secretary will ever say \"there is no obvious limit to legal immigration\".</p> <p><strong>Dangerous world</strong></p> <p>When the Cold War ended, we all hoped that our children and grandchildren would grow up in a safer world. </p> <p>That hope was shattered on September 11th 2001.</p> <p>Our world changed. Taking a plane, going on the Tube - all these things suddenly carried a new risk.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we face the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. </p> <p>How do we confront this sense of insecurity? How do we tackle these threats?</p> <p>First, people need to be told the truth about the threats we face. And if we consider the threat to our freedom and our interests merit military action, we should not flinch.</p> <p>Every day British servicemen and women face great danger in Iraq. The way they carry out their duties does Britain proud, and makes Britain proud. </p> <p>I believe it was right to go to war. That's a controversial view. Many people would prefer me to say something else. But that is how I see it. And I owe it to you to tell you how I see it.</p> <p>The world is a better place without Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Saddam had provoked two wars in the Gulf. He had used chemical weapons against other nations and against his own people. No one knew if and when he would get his hands on more weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>So I think it was right to go to war. But I also think it's right to tell the truth.</p> <p>In the run-up to the war, Tony Blair did not tell the truth. He did not give a truthful account of the intelligence he received. He did not behave as a British Prime Minister should. </p> <p>Tony Blair has said that mistakes were made. He has said he accepts responsibility. But it is not a question of responsibility. It is a question of credibility. </p> <p>I hope that we will not face another war. </p> <p>But the world is a very dangerous place, and you can never be sure.</p> <p>What if this Prime Minister asks people to trust him again? Could the British people trust him a second time?</p> <p><strong>Conservative beliefs</strong></p> <p>If you want people to trust you, you must trust them. </p> <p>Of course, I don't believe that we are right about everything and Labour politicians are wrong about everything.</p> <p>Neither party has a monopoly on virtue.</p> <p>But I do believe that there are times in our history when Conservative ideas are more relevant to the challenges Britain faces. And we have reached one of those times today.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I believe that if people are given a choice, they will make the right decision for themselves and their families.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I understand that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than governments are.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I want people to be big, and the State to be small.</p> <p>I am a Conservative because I know that government should be accountable to the people, not people to the government. </p> <p>And I am a Conservative because I have an inherent belief in fair play - no-one should be over-mighty, not the trade unions, not the State, not corporations, not the European Union - not even the Prime Minister.</p> <p>We want to live in a society where people have the freedom to get on in life and get on with their lives, safe in the knowledge that government will provide them with security. Freedom and security: two timeless Conservative ambitions. </p> <p>This is what makes me a Conservative. And I believe it's what makes all of you Conservatives.</p> <p>So when people ask you on the doorstep:</p> <p>\"I can't stand Tony Blair, but why should I vote for you lot?\"</p> <p>Here are ten words to remember.</p> <p>School discipline.</p> <p>More police.</p> <p>Cleaner hospitals.</p> <p>Lower taxes.</p> <p>Controlled immigration.</p> <p>Ten words to address the problems that are worrying people today.</p> <p>Remember those words.</p> <p>And remember one more: accountability.</p> <p>Don't forget to tell them. We won't just make a difference. We'll be different. </p> <p>We'll be accountable to them.</p> <p>We'll do what we say.</p> <p>There'll be less talk, more action.</p> <p>Optimistic about our people's future? Yes.</p> <p>Ambitious for Britain? Certainly.</p> <p>But always utterly practical</p> <p>Ours is a philosophy that is rooted in reality.</p> <p>And it delivers.</p> <p>Britain is the best country in the world</p> <p>It delivers for our country. </p> <p>We all love our country.</p> <p>But everything I have and everything I am I owe to this country. </p> <p>I was born in July 1941, two weeks after Hitler invaded Russia. </p> <p>Those were very dark days. </p> <p>In the next four years millions of people were killed. </p> <p>Many lost their lives on the battlefield, at sea and in the air. </p> <p>Many lost their lives in cities blitzed from the air. </p> <p>And many lost their lives in the concentration camps set up by one of the cruellest tyrannies the world has ever known. </p> <p>My grandmother was one of those killed in the concentration camps.</p> <p>If it hadn't been for Winston Churchill, and if it hadn't been for Britain, I would have been one of them too. </p> <p>That's why when I say I owe everything I am to this country, I really do mean it.</p> <p>I owe my life to it.</p> <p>My father told me Britain was the best country in the world. </p> <p>I think it was. </p> <p>And I think it still is. </p> <p>But I know we could be doing so much better. </p> <p>And it's because I think I can help make things better that I am standing before you today.</p> <p>Put simply, I'm here so I can give back to Britain a tiny fraction of what Britain has given to me.</p>",
  "Michael Howard's grandmother, he told the conference, had been murdered by the Nazis. His mother had been killed by a bug picked up in an NHS hospital. But Mr Howard wasn't angry. He wasn't even annoyed, or a little bit worked up. He was deadly, awfully calm. <p>\"Neither party has a monopoly on virtue or wisdom,\" he said, in the tone of a man whom rage was an emotion not calculated to please. Last year, his predecessor, the Quiet Man, threatened to turn up the volume. Mr Howard is keeping it down. You've got to consider the neighbours, after all.</p> <p>\"I do believe that there are times in our history when Conservative ideas are more relevant to the challenges Britain faces,\" the Tory leader added, entirely reasonably. Imagine what would have happened if Margaret Thatcher had tried that line at a Conservative conference! Michael Heseltine would have been caught red-handed with the tranquilliser gun.</p> <p>Mr Howard's demeanour had something of Wordsworth's Old Man Travelling about it. This particular Lyrical Ballad describes an elderly man \"insensibly subdued/ To settled quiet\" - who was on his way to visit his dying son in a Falmouth hospital. He was, you might recall, \"by nature led/ To peace so perfect, that the young behold/ With envy, what the Old Man hardly feels.\"</p> <p>\"Life is far too precious to be written off,\" Mr Howard told delegates. He was talking about drug addicts at the time, but the audience knew exactly how he felt. Some of them were old enough to be his mother, and they were worried about dirty hospitals, too.</p> <p>\"I want to live in a country where we honour our older generations, cherish their wisdom and care for their needs,\" he said. He wasn't promising to cut taxes. That was what he wanted to do one day - but not on Day One. Since they retired from power, the Tories have an awful lot of time on their hands, and they've done what any over-taxed, under-occupied retired person does: set themselves a timetable. It gives them a feeling of clarity and purpose, even if they're not quite sure when they'll be able to start pruning back the roses and throwing the neighbour's cat back over the fence.</p> <p>\"It's because I think I can help make things better that I am standing before you today,\" Mr Howard concluded hopefully, with a touching mixture of humility and determination. The hall struggled to its feet. A couple of delegates nervously got out a union flag. The conference programme had said balloons were absolutely banned. But a flag was OK, wasn't it?</p> <p>The Tory leader smiled ingratiatingly. It was then I realised: Mr Howard had put himself under an anti-social behaviour order. It wasn't easy. But the Elgar wasn't turned up too loud and Sandra was by his side. With any luck, he might be untagged and back on the fringe by 2006.</p>",

  "<p>The social worker at the centre of the Victoria Climbi\u00e9 child abuse scandal acted negligently in failing to properly protect the girl, an employment tribunal heard today.</p> <p>Lisa Arthurworrey, who was sacked for gross misconduct by the north London borough of Haringey in November 2002, made eight serious mistakes in her handling of Victoria's case for which she bore sole responsibility, an independent social work consultant told the tribunal in north London.</p> <p>But Bernard Monaghan, who conducted an independent investigation into Haringey social services following Victoria's death, also said that the social worker had suffered from \"extremely flawed supervision\" during the time she was allocated the eight-year-old's case.</p> <p>Ms Arthurworrey is appealing against her dismissal from the council, claiming that she has been made a scapegoat for its poor child protection procedures. </p> <p>Victoria died in February 2000 after suffering months of torture and neglect at the hands of her great aunt, Marie Therese Kouao, and the woman's boyfriend, Carl Manning.</p> <p>Mr Monaghan told the tribunal that his report recommended that another six Haringey staff should have been subjected to disciplinary proceedings. These included Ms Arthurworrey's line manager, Carol Baptiste, her team manager Angella Mairs, senior social worker Rose Kozinos and child protection advisor Petra Kitchman. Only Ms Mairs was disciplined - and later sacked - along with Ms Arthurworrey.</p> <p>Mr Monaghan set out eight failures made by Ms Arthurworrey in her handling of Victoria's case, which he concluded amounted to negligence:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>she \"manifestly\" failed to call a child protection conference despite the recommendation of a strategy meeting called after Kouao raised and then withdrew allegations that Manning had sexually abused Victoria; <strong>\u00b7 </strong>she failed to carry out a Section 47 inquiry under the Children Act 1989, which required her to make inquiries about the concerns for Victoria's welfare;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>she failed to give \"proper attention and evaluation\" to much of the information about Victoria' case. Had she done so \"a more worrying picture of Victoria would have emerged\";</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>she failed to carefully read a fax from Central Middlesex Hospital about Victoria's admission and the assessment of her injuries. The fax showed the \"worrying picture\" of Victoria's circumstances and that Kouao \"had been making untruthful statements\". She failed to clarify the contents of this fax with staff at the hospital;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>she failed to interview Victoria in accordance with her child protection training. The girl was not asked pertinent questions that could have exposed her suffering, nor was she provided with an interpreter despite coming from the Ivory Coast and speaking little English;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>she failed to check that Victoria was attending school;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>she failed to make use of Haringey's child protection guidelines or national government guidance;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>she failed to inform a consultant at North Middlesex Hospital of the outcome of her enquiries into Victoria's welfare despite promising to do so.</p> <p>Mr Monaghan said that Ms Arthurworrey's evidence to the public inquiry into Victoria's death \"indicated that she accepted that each of the eight points was her responsibility and that she agreed that she had failed to carry out that responsibility.\"</p> <p>The consultant said that when assessing Ms Arthurworrey's culpability he had taken into account that she was a qualified social worker with 18 months' experience. </p> <p>But he heavily criticised the former social worker's supervisors and managers. He found Carol Baptiste, Ms Arthurworrey's line manager until early November 1999, to be \"ineffective as a manager\". He added that the guidance and supervision she gave was \"wholly inadequate\".</p> <p>Angella Mairs, Ms Arthurworrey's next manager, also provided superficial supervision and inadequate guidance. Rose Kozinos, a senior practitioner in Ms Arthurworrey's team, never looked at nor read Victoria's file. Petra Kitchman, a child protection advisor, also failed to correct the social worker's \"wrong assumptions\" about Victoria's case.</p> <p>The tribunal is scheduled to finish on Monday. The social services director of Haringey, Anne Bristow, is due to give evidence to the tribunal tomorrow. Ms Arthurworrey is expected to give evidence on Thursday.</p>",
  "The chief operating officer of giant arms firm BAE, Steven Mogford, is today named in a BBC programme as the man behind the company's \"slush fund\", which made \u00a360m of corrupt payments to Saudi officials, including providing prostitutes, Rolls-Royces and Californian holidays. <p>Mr Mogford, 48, is also accused on tonight's Money Programme of giving orders to suppress an internal investigation into the slush fund. </p> <p>Mr Mogford's signed authority appears on BAE's files authorising huge corrupt payments with the words \"OK to pay.\" </p> <p>The Guardian is publishing these documents on its website today. They directly implicate one of the arms firm's most senior executives in a spreading scandal. </p> <p>Last week a Ministry of Defence civil servant, John Porter, was arrested and questioned about alleged unauthorised free holidays and gifts he and his wife received from BAE's slush fund. </p> <p>The documents we are publishing today suggest that BAe used an elaborate process of false accounting to make huge payments, many of them to the top official responsible for Saudi arms purchases, Prince Turki bin Nasser. </p> <p>For instance, one single month's file lists 23 payments, totalling almost \u00a31m, made for the benefit of top Saudis in August 1995. </p> <p>These include cash paid into American Express accounts; the hire of a yacht in California and stays at luxury hotels in the United States and Spain. </p> <p>The payments were made by a \"front\" private travel agency and listed on a monthly invoice to BAE's \"customer relations executive\", Wing Commander Tony Winship, who operated from a London hotel suite apparently unconnected with the company. </p> <p>The entries were written in code: \"T1\" was Prince Turki, \"N1\" was his wife, Nora. </p> <p>The invoice was then re-written on a single sheet of paper. It simply stated: \"Accommodation services and support for overseas visitors.\" </p> <p>Wing Cdr Winship sent the bill to Mr Mogford at BAE's headquarters at Warton, Lancashire, writing: \"Dear Steve, Please find attached the August invoice from Travellers World as arranged.\" </p> <p>Mr Mogford scribbled on it two days later \"OK to pay\" and signed it. BAE's finance department paid \u00a3987,365.03 into the travel agency's bank the following month. </p> <p>Peter Gardiner, who ran Travellers World, tells the BBC the reason for the circuitous system was \"minimum amount of paper. No paper trail and no one to intercept it. No more questions being asked about it\". </p> <p>BAE continued to remain silent about the allegations last night, other than to claim it had not broken the law. Since 2002 such payments have been a criminal offence. </p> <p>The Serious Fraud Office and the MoD police are attempting to conduct a joint inquiry into the activities of the powerful firm, which critics accuse of having a stranglehold over the Blair government. </p> <p>The former foreign secretary, Robin Cook, alleges in his memoirs: \"In my time I came to learn that the chairman of British Aerospace [Sir Richard Evans] appeared to have the key to the garden door to No 10. Certainly I never once knew No 10 come up with any decision that would be incommoding to British Aerospace.\" </p> <p>In tonight's programme, Bribing for Britain?, it emerges that the Labour-dominated Commons defence committee allowed BAE to give misleading evidence, in which its then chairman, Sir Richard Evans, pooh-poohed the idea of the slush fund's existence. </p> <p>Sir Richard said: \"I can certainly assure you that we _ are not in the business of making payments to members of any government _ it is just not the way business is done.\" </p> <p>Mr Gardiner, the travel agency whistleblower, tells today's programme he personally handled corrupt payments of up to \u00a37m a year through a BAE front company throughout the 1990s until 2002. </p> <p>Mike Hancock, the Liberal Democrat MP and defence committee member, said: \"At the very minimum the defence committee should summon him back.\" </p> <p>Since the Guardian first exposed the existence of BAE's slush fund a year ago, the firm has continued its apparently untroubled intimacy with Labour ministers. </p> <p>Mr Blair intervened this summer to overrule an independent watchdog and allow the Air Chief Marshal, Sir John Day, to move straight from handling BAE affairs at the Ministry of Defence to take up a lucrative post with the firm. </p> <p>According to documents obtained by the Guardian, the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, went to the firm's factory last September, after overruling his own permanent secretary and insisting on buying BAe's Hawk warplane for the MoD.</p>",
  "A Save the Pound bathrobe is walking towards me. Inside it is Edith Bigg, a tall, grey blur. \"Save the pound!\" she says to me. \"Save the pound!\" I am in a very strange place. The UK Independence Party (Ukip) is holding its annual conference in Bristol. As I walk past Robert Kilroy-Silk's Bentley, a lone female protester shouts \"Racists!\" in my vague direction. I am greeted by a triumvirate of Staffordshire Ukip members. \"We are going to gain control of national politics in the House of Commons,\" says a Mr Goode, an engineer specialising in steel fabrications. \"We will bring back Common Sense to our nation.\" His friends nod. <p>Inside, my bag is searched by smiling women \"for flour and eggs, my dear\". Might I bake a Ukip cake to hurl at Kilroy's perfect nose? I see facial hair, 1930s hats, Arran sweaters, angry vicars, fishermen and Jonathan Aitken. If Agatha Christie had written a political thriller, or if Engelbert Humperdink's fan-club entered parliament, this is what it would look like. It is, for a grimy urbanite, very strange indeed. </p> <p>The party certainly has a theme: two enormous gold pound signs, sliced in two to accommodate the Ukip logo, are suspended, twinkling, over the stage. Opposite, basking in their light, are the 1,100 old and middle-aged faces who delivered seven million leaflets back in June. I also see a very young black girl in the second row. </p> <p>Petrina Holdsworth, the party chair, an elegant former barrister on secondment from a Joanna Trollope novel, is in the spotlight onstage, directing the party onwards. \"We remember June, when Ukip came of age,\" she says in perfect posh talk. \"We educated the British public. No to more European integration!\" My attention is stolen by Stephen Anderson, the man who pushed the Tories into fourth place in the Hartlepool byelection. He has mounted the platform and is addressing the delegates. \"Kilroy,\" he explains, \"came to Hartlepool and literally stopped traffic!\" </p> <p>Chris Leas, a short man who looks like a gangster, mounts the podium. Boy does he mount it. He is angry. He is very angry. He exclaims that two years ago, \"I walked out of my nice villa in Marbella and I was arrested for being an international drug smuggler. I was imprisoned for 50 weeks without charge.\" This is, he says, thanks to the fascistic Euro police. \"I made a vow to see the relentless juggernaut of Brussels stop before this happens to others in this great country.\" </p> <p>I am confused. My confusion is suddenly washed away by The Man Himself. The \"Kilroy phenomenon\" is here. Kilroy-Silk joined the party four months ago, but speaks like a man who has given it his life. Like a human bottle of hairspray, upright, golden and faintly poisonous, he begins. \"I've been dying to meet you,\" he drawls, as if the assembled ranks of Ukip supporters were a woman he is trying to seduce. He holds its hand and caresses its wrist. \"You panicked the major parties; you scared them to death. These things are not supposed to happen.\" Then he lays a hand on Ukip's crotch. \"This success is yours. It's been a long road for many of us. We can change the face of Britain and we are going to change it! Our opportunity is today - not tomorrow!\" He almost said: \"Tomorrow belongs to me.\" </p> <p>Kilroy dedicates 10 minutes to denying that the party is racist, so I decide to track down the Ukip Black Person I had spotted earlier, one of only three ethnic-minority members I could find. She is a sweet A-level student from north London called Jummy Olajide. She is currently doing work experience for Ukip's deputy leader, Mike Nattrass. Her parents are Nigerian. She featured in the party political broadcast. I ask her why she joined Ukip. \"I agree with their immigration policy,\" she says (this is essentially, like the Gucci shop in Selfridges, one in, one out). Nattrass says, \"We've got to go.\" </p> <p>I decide to track down the leaders of Ukip, who were pressing the flesh in the lobby. There is Nigel Farage, MEP, a handsome giggling 40-year-old. He was Ukip's darling before Kilroy stole his smile; \"The leadership was his for the taking two years ago\" I am told. I find Roger Knapman, the leader, fat and smiling, a former Tory Whip under John Major. There is Godfrey Bloom MEP, whose infamous command that women clean fridges made a splash, flirtatious and a little camp. And the gorgeous Petrina - who wants to \"send the members back inspired\". </p> <p>I bump into Jonathan Aitken, who joined Ukip five months ago - \"before the Euro elections,\" he says pointedly. He tells me that he and Kilroy became MPs on the same day and have toured the Middle East together. He says he hasn't made up his mind if he will stand for Ukip in his old constituency of Thanet. \"This is a serious party growing in confidence and support and serious voting power. I would distance myself from any party that is racist and so would Robert Kilroy-Silk.\" I can smell on Aitken the lust to return to parliament. It mingles with his aftershave. </p> <p>Finally I find Kilroy. He stands in front of a crowd of admirers and the television crew that seems to be surgically attached to him. \"The Labour party started with three people,\" he says. \"And things happen quicker these days.\" How is his fundraising? \"I've got more money promised me than I can spend.\" He flashes a Mephistophelean smile. </p> <p>An excited, murmuring queue had formed at the parliamentary candidates' desk. Everyone, it seems, wants to enter parliament. They each receive a form, which requests details of criminal convictions, \"anything that might cause embarrassment were it to be revealed\" and signed confirmation that they \"have never been a member of a racist organisation\". Ukip had a purge of BNP infiltrators two years ago and claims to be watchful for Christian fundamentalists who might sneak in. </p> <p>I hurry back to the hall for the great debate of the weekend. The party has to decide whether to contest every seat in the next general election, or to back off if sitting MPs agree to push their eurosceptic line. Do they want to steal the Tory crown or just mend it? To much cheering the result is announced: they will contest every seat. Michael Howard - sweat, baby. </p> <p>In the pub I encounter Reg Mahrra, an Indian Ukipper . \"I want out of Europe,\" he says. \"Europe is a disease.\" He describes himself as \"a social animal\" who \"knew Barry White once\", and adds, \"I have mixed with the criminal fraternity all my life.\" He confirms that, like almost everyone else, he wants to stand for parliament. Nearby is a member with a charismatic moustache called Roy Woodwood. He rails against the government that \"sold us down the canal\". He particularly hates \"the tosspot despot Prescott\". </p> <p>Sunday brings us drama. Kilroy has attempted a putsch on the Frost Show. He wants the leadership and hopes to persuade Roger to retire. What does Roger think? Does he mind? \"When I became leader no one else wanted it,\" he says smiling. \"I have been elected for four years and I have only served two years and one day. I intend to serve the remaining year and 364 days. Now everyone seems to want the job. This is a sign we are a healthy party.\" Will he accept Aitken as a parliamentary candidate? \"I hope he'll put his name forward to the appropriate committee and I hope the decision will be taken by those who know him best.\" </p> <p>The perjurer and the hair-spray are not loved here. I take the temperature of the Kilroy putsch with the party members. Has the chat-show lizard prevailed? Not yet. The grassroots are angry with their phenomenon, who has disappeared. \"He's only been here five minutes,\" I'm told. \"What about Roger? Roger has done everything for us. Kilroy must prove himself. He's only a minor celebrity after all.\" </p> <p>Wandering into the press room, I find Dick Morris, Bill Clinton's former spin doctor who quit after being caught in a rumpled bed with a prostitute. He has been drafted in as a consultant. Sleek and fat, he reminds me of an intelligent pigeon. He compares British politics to a sinking boat. \"There are lots of people on this boat who want different movies, food and destinations. But we are the only party that is concerned the boat is sinking.\" </p> <p>Outside the churning conference, the protest has swelled to three. \"You're as mad as a box of frogs!\" shouts a Ukip member. I return to the hall. The compere is dragging forward the \"unsung heroes\" of Ukip. Somebody named A Badger has been nominated by a Miss Bull. Suddenly, Jummy is on-stage and looking petrified. \"Jummy is rather coloured,\" says the compere. \"This proves we are a multiracial party.\" He rubs her hand, and puts an arm around her. \"It doesn't come off.\" </p> <p>The conference closes with Knapman, the leader Kilroy wants to oust. \"You have proved you are winners!\" Then he quotes Victor Hugo: \"Nothing can stop an idea whose time has come.\" </p> <p>I find I have developed a fondness for these fervent amateurs. Last week I was at the Labour party conference, surrounded by self-important glossy robots. These people, weird, creepy and bizarre though they are, are real. As I gather my things and prepare to leave Ukip-land, an angry man is clutching the podium, railing against the Euro fiend. He is interrupted by the Tannoy. \"A gentleman has lost his ride to Tunbridge Wells,\" it says. \"Can anyone else offer one?\" The man begins to speak again but there is another announcement. \"The Ukip Montego,\" it tells us, 'is about to be towed away.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Tory health secretary will become the secretary of state for public health, reflecting his new \"personal priority\", shadow health spokesman Andrew Lansley said today.</p> <p>Mr Lansley attacked the New Labour government for offering patients a \"fragmented\" approach to public health delivery with \"confused and mixed messages\" that have seen the rate of infectious diseases rise and the level of MMR vaccination drop to a worrying level.</p> <p>The pitch to steal New Labour's thunder comes just weeks before John Reid unveils a new white paper on public health. </p> <p>Mr Lansley pledged to set up an independent public health commission which would gather evidence and make recommendations with local public health teams to tackle endemic health concerns such as the rate of smoking, substance abuse, poor housing, and poverty, he said.</p> <p>Mr Lansley's address to delegates rehearsed Tory calls for the scrapping of star performance ratings in hospitals, the death of the NHS target culture, and the handing back of control of NHS delivery to the frontline.</p> <p>He called for an end to an NHS service \"submerged by bureaucracy\" so that \"we recruit doctors and nurses three times faster than managers not the other way around. Where hospitals don't have 41 different inspectors or 250 targets.\"</p> <p>Playing on Tory claims that the NHS is filled with bureaucrats at the expense of frontline staff, Mr Lansley said an NHS under the Tories would be one where it would \"not be possible for managers to overrule infection control teams who say a ward should be closed.\"</p> <p>He added: \"On the first day, we will abolish central targets imposed on hospitals so doctors, nurses and managers will be able to run hospitals in the interests of patients.\"</p> <p>Prior to his speech, he made unfavourable comparisons to Holland, where patients are 44 times less likely to contract the antibiotic resistant MRSA virus than their UK counterparts.</p> <p>Speaking in the health and education debate, he pledged to introduce \"barrier wards\" to protect the wider patient population from contracting the infection. </p> <p>But aside from the well-rehearsed Tory policy of part-funding private healthcare to reduce NHS waiting lists and avoid those with private insurance from paying \"twice\", Mr Lansley's health menu listed at conference echoed much of existing New labour policy and vision. </p> <p>Citing the mantra of \"choice\" first introduced by former health secretary Alan Milburn, Mr Lansley said the Tory version would see the NHS \"accountable to patients, not bureaucrats\", where patients have more control over their health and more choice, fuelled by proper information.</p> <p>Unlike the government, choice under the Tories would not be \"restricted by bureaucracy\", he said. Patient choice will in turn stimulate investment and new capacity, by encouraging patients to take responsibility for their care and promoting innovation. </p> <p>\"Armed with information, patients will be able to book treatments through their GP, at the hospital of their choice. As an NHS patient, their treatment will be free. The hospital may be a foundation hospital or a private one, but NHS care will be free, to NHS standards.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Morgan, the health spokesman for Wales, told conference earlier that the restructuring of health services in Wales is costing \u00a320m.</p>",
  "An incoming Conservative government would make a \"war on crime\" the centrepiece of its plans to make Britain a country envied around the world, Michael Howard was telling his party conference today. <p>In a no-nonsense address, the Tory leader was also laying out plans for new action on drug abuse, tougher discipline in schools and radical measures to control immigration. </p> <p>Mr Howard, who was buoyed up earlier today by news that the UK Independence party had lost its biggest financial backer, the multi-millionaire Paul Sykes, also signalled a determination to take powers back from Brussels. </p> <p>He promised that on its first day in power a Conservative government would set the date for the referendum on the European constitution - the Tories want the British people to reject the document. </p> <p>Although he refrained from promising to cut particular taxes, Mr Howard reassured his audience that: \"When I can, I will cut taxes.\" </p> <p>On crime, Mr Howard pledged: \"The first problem I'll get a grip on is crime. The gloves will come off.\" </p> <p>He promised to copy the \"zero tolerance\" approach to crime pioneered in New York. </p> <p>\"What [Rudi] Giuliani did in New York, what Ray Mallon did in Middlesbrough, we'll do for the whole of Britain. A war on crime.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard said: \"We need a government that will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. A government that will put their rights first.\" </p> <p>And Mr Howard, who as home secretary famously declared that \"prison works\" , promised: \"Career criminals and dangerous offenders should be in prison - not roaming our streets. So we will build more prisons.\" </p> <p>On immigration, Mr Howard said that in its first week, a Tory government would signal its intention to withdraw from the 1951 UN refugee convention. </p> <p><b>Police reforms</b></p> <p>Mr Howard went on to tell his audience: \"Three weeks ago, on a Saturday night, I went out on the streets of Brixton with people from local churches. I saw the problems their community is up against. </p> <p>\"In two hours we didn't meet a single policeman. Not one. This was inner city London, just before midnight, on a Saturday night. No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote. </p> <p>\"The problem is that the police are handcuffed by paperwork. They now have to spend almost as much time at the station as they do out on the streets. </p> <p>\"And now this government is making it worse. The police will now have to fill in a form every time they stop someone. Not stop and search. Just stop someone. </p> <p>\"It takes seven minutes to complete that form. Just think about it. If a police officer stops half a dozen unruly youngsters, he'll have to spend the best part of an hour filling in forms. </p> <p>\"I don't want police filling in forms. I want them on the streets doing their job. </p> <p>\"People are fed up that when the police do catch criminals the punishment never seems to fit the crime. Under a new Labour law, shoplifters will only get a fixed penalty fine and no criminal record. Theft is now no worse than parking on a yellow line. </p> <p>\"I promise you I'm not making this up. </p> <p>\"And five years ago, Labour introduced an early release scheme. Since then 3,600 crimes - including rape - have been committed by criminals let out of prison early. Every one of those crimes could have been prevented. </p> <p>\"All this has to change. </p> <p>\"Day One: That form police officers will have to fill in every time they stop someone, that form will go into the appropriate filing tray - the bin. </p> <p>\"Week One: Labour's early release scheme - that will go. </p> <p>\"Month One: We'll start to recruit 5,000 more police officers a year.\" </p> <p><b>Limiting immigration</b></p> <p>On immigration and asylum, Mr Howard accused the Labour government of presiding over a \"chaotic and out of control\" system. </p> <p>\"Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country. And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent. </p> <p>\"All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused. And they are increasingly concerned about the impact of immigration on our public services our schools, hospitals and transport. </p> <p>\"But that's hardly surprising. Immigration has doubled under Labour. And we have a home secretary who believes that 'there is no obvious legal limit to legal immigration'.\" </p> <p>\"I think we've reached a turning point. We cannot allow unlimited immigration to Britain to continue. We need a government that gets a grip on this shambles. </p> <p>\"A government which helps genuine refugees. A government that gives priority to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our country. </p> <p>\"So in week one, Michael Ancram (now shadow foreign secretary) will signal Britain's intention to pull out of the 1951 UN refugee convention. We want asylum cases to be decided more quickly and more fairly. We want to allow genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue. That's what I call fair. </p> <p>\"And in month one, we'll set out plans to enable parliament to put an annual limit on the number of people who come to Britain. </p> <p>\"No Conservative home secretary will ever say 'there is no obvious legal limit to legal immigration'.\" </p> <p><b>Early vote on EU constitution</b></p> <p>On Britain's relations with the EU, Mr Howard told conference: \"On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. \"Europe isn't working properly today and the constitution will only make matters worse. </p> <p>\"The European Union is spewing out too many regulations. It's holding our economy back. We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard argued that the time had come for Britain to opt out of what he described as the momentum towards \"ever closer integration.\" </p> <p>\"This is what I will do. Some of our European partners want to integrate further. I'll say to them 'Fine. Britain will no longer try and stop you. But we must have something in return. We want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain'.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard argued: \"It is not enough to say no to the European constitution - though a Conservative government will. It is not enough to say no to the euro - though a Conservative government will. </p> <p>\"It's time we went further. We want out of the social chapter, which is a threat to British jobs. We want out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which is destroying communities. And we want more British aid to be distributed from London and less from Brussels. </p> <p>\"It's time to bring powers back to Britain.\" </p> <p>He added: \"My message to you is simple. If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you're from, come and join us.\" </p>",
  "<p>A ladybird which has caused \"catastrophic\" damage to other insect species in the US is on the loose in Britain, an expert said today. </p> <p>Harmonia axyridis - also known as the Harlequin ladybird or multi-coloured ladybug - poses a \"deadly threat\" to butterflies, lacewings and many other ladybirds, Dr Michael Majerus, of Cambridge University's genetics department, said. </p> <p>The Harlequin, an Asian species, was introduced into North America 25 years ago to fight aphids. Since then, it has spread to Europe and was last month seen in the garden of a pub in Sible Hedingham, Essex. </p> <p>\"This is, without doubt, the ladybird I have least wanted to see here,\" Dr Majerus said. \"I knew it was on its way, but I hoped it wouldn't arrive so soon. Now many of our ladybirds will be in direct competition with this aggressively invasive species, and some will simply not cope.\"</p> <p>A Cambridge University spokesman explained that a huge increase in harmonia axyridis numbers over the last ten years was threatening endemic North American ladybirds and other aphid predators.</p> <p>The insects are still sold by biocontrol companies in Europe, and their numbers are increasing in France, Belgium and Holland.</p> <p>Dr Majerus said houses had been inundated by harmonia axyridis, which feed in fruit, seeking places to spend the winter. The ladybirds are particularly fond of grapes, and wineries had reported huge numbers among harvested crops. </p> <p>\"It is critical to monitor this ladybird now, before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own British ladybirds,\" he said.</p>",
  "Janet Leigh, who has died aged 77, appeared in some four dozen films in a Hollywood career that began in 1947. But the single role that ensured her a continuing place in movie history was that of Marion Crane, who meets her fate in the gleaming white of a motel bathroom in the extraordinary shower murder sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). <p>The sequence was, above all, a tour de force of editing, but its emotional effect depended on the identification the viewer brought earlier in the film to the sympathetic and vulnerable figure that Leigh presented. She later recalled the experience in matter- of-fact-terms: \"Hitchcock followed the storyboard precisely. We worked on it for about a week, but it went very professionally and quickly.\" She added: \"It was, of course, gruelling to stand in a shower getting drenched for a week.\"</p> <p>Leigh, whose real name was Jeanette Helen Morrison, had originally been discovered for the movies in a fashion that seems to parallel Hollywood fiction. Her father was working as reception manager at a ski-resort hotel near Reno, Nevada, and had his daughter's photograph on his desk. Norma Shearer, who had retired from MGM in 1942, was visiting the resort with her husband, saw the picture and casually asked if she could take it back to her old studio.</p> <p>Leigh was duly sent for, and despite having no previous acting experience, was signed up to a seven-year contract. She made her screen debut in The Romance Of Rosy Ridge (1947) and progressed to prominent appearances as an ing\u00e9nue in some typically plush MGM productions, co-starring with Lassie in Hills Of Home (1948) and playing Meg in Little Women and June Forsyte in The Forsyte Saga (both 1949).</p> <p>Her public profile was considerably raised by her marriage, in 1951, to Tony Curtis, then a fast-rising screen heart-throb. The union generated substantial media attention, and, by extension of this, the two went on to appear together in several 1950s movies, among them the engagingly ridiculous medieval romp The Black Shield Of Falworth (1954) and the rather less engaging The Vikings (1958).</p> <p>The marriage lasted until 1962, ending when Curtis saw fit to leave Leigh for the German actor Christine Kauffmann. The daughter of Curtis and Leigh's marriage is Jamie Lee Curtis, who later followed in her parents' professional footsteps.</p> <p>During the 1950s, Leigh's many other screen appearances ranged from a rugged western, The Naked Spur (1952) - she made \"an unlikely addition to the ranks of the western wildcats,\" said one reviewer discouragingly - to providing the statutory feminine interest in a Dean Martin and Gerry Lewis farce, Living It Up (1954).</p> <p>The most notable memory of this stage of her career came with a superb musical comedy, My Sister Eileen (1955). She lobbied for the role, and later enthused about the experience of preparing for the dance numbers with the choreographer Bob Fosse: \"He's a master, he's marvellous.\" She also reflected that playing comedy was less challenging than is sometimes supposed: \"I have never played comedy anyway, except absolutely straight. If it's funny, it's because the situation is funny.\"</p> <p>In 1958, Leigh played in the film which, after Psycho, is probably the most celebrated of her career, Orsen Wells's baroque melodrama Touch Of Evil. At the time, it was famously unsuccessful, despite having Charlton Heston as co-star, and was buried by its producers, Universal International. Years later, Heston introduced a screening of it by describing it as \"the first underground movie ever made\". Over subsequent years though, its critical standing has steadily grown.</p> <p>Touch Of Evil is set in a Mexican border town, but locations were shot in a seedy part of Venice, California. Leigh remembered: \"We shot all night long, which I hated. It was a terrible place to work, but also fascinating because we worked in actual derelict hotels.\" She also contrived to work throughout the film with a broken arm, having suffered an accident shortly before shooting began. \"I had my arm set in an unobtrusive way, and I'd have a coat over it and gesture a lot with my other arm.\"</p> <p>In Touch Of Evil, Leigh's character spends part of the time effectively imprisoned in a sinister motel, in a fashion which curiously prefigures her role in Psycho. The sheer impact of the latter film made it a hard act to follow: Leigh, like her co-stars Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles, never seemed wholly to emerge from the long shadow it cast.</p> <p>However, for several years she continued to play starring roles in prominent productions, among them The Manchurian Candidate (1962), an eccentric conspiracy thriller - and the subject of a recent updated remake - which has acquired perhaps an unjustified cult reputation.</p> <p>But by the mid-1960s, Leigh began to slip into lesser roles - for instance, a cameo in the detective story Harper (1966) - or to appear in indifferent, low-budget pictures like Hello Down There (1969) or Night Of The Lepus (1972). In subsequent years, she worked only occasionally, though she starred in The Fog (1980), a horror film by John Carpenter, who had, two years before, directed Jamie Lee Curtis in the film which established her reputation, Halloween. Both castings probably reflected Carpenter's urge to invoke the shade of Hitchcock.</p> <p>Leigh published an autobiography, There Really Was A Hollywood, in 1984, and ventured into the authorship of romantic fiction. The past-tense title of her memoirs aptly summons up apprehension of a career that belonged to the vanished days of the studio system - of overnight discovery, the gilded bondage of long-term contracts, the diktat of gossip columnists and fan magazines (for whom the marriage of Leigh and Curtis represented a treasure trove of material).</p> <p>As Leigh herself said of MGM, with perhaps a modicum of exaggeration: \"They used to keep about 150 people under contract, and if they got one or two out of the 150 that would be great, because they were only paying them $50 a week.\"</p> <p>What is incontrovertible is that MGM got more than their money's worth for Janet Leigh. And so - in the exhilarating dance numbers of My Sister Eileen, and the motel terrors of Touch Of Evil and Psycho, plus sundry scattered moments elsewhere - did we.</p> <p>She is survived by her fourth husband, Robert Brandt, and two daughters.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Janet Leigh (Jeanette Helen Morrison), film actor, born July 6 1927; died October 3 2004</p>",
  "You know, last year, something very important happened. A new beginning. <p>No - I know what you're thinking - but not that. Something even more important, at least to me and my wife Sally. Our daughter, Martha, was born.</p> <p>She was born at the 'Rosie' Maternity hospital in Cambridge. Today they celebrate 21 years of the Rosie. Happy Birthday! Rosie - although I suspect they're too busy to be watching. Four and a half thousand babies a year is a lot of new beginnings. If anyone ever says the NHS doesn't deliver, tell them that.</p> <p>The National Health Service was there for us then. It is there for us in the moments of hope, and of despair. Of happiness and sadness. When we are at our most vulnerable.</p> <p>That is why nothing matters more than the future of the National Health Service. We need to know it will be there for us. Those who work in the NHS need to know we are there for them. They have every right to expect it. </p> <p>How many of us have to make life and death decisions when we're dog-tired? How many of us have to be able to account for every decision because, if something goes wrong, someone could die? How many of us have a chance to give someone back their health and their hope?</p> <p>That's why doctors and nurses, other health professionals, are not just part of a hierarchy; like teachers, police or the armed services, they are part of the fabric of our quality of life. For them, and for the contribution they make, we know their value, we don't just count the cost.</p> <p>GP practices see a million patients a day. 200 thousand visit hospital services. Twenty thousand operations a day. Two million prescriptions. And all this for less than the price of a packet of cigarettes - just under \u00a34 a day for each of us.</p> <p>Labour say we don't understand or appreciate the NHS - they treat it like it's their property. A typical Labour combination of arrogance and misrepresentation. </p> <p>As Conservatives we rely on the NHS, we work in the NHS and, yes, we care about the NHS.</p> <p>And it is because we care about the NHS that we know the NHS deserves better. People used to say the NHS was the envy of the world. Why don't they say it today?</p> <p>Not because we don't have some of the finest doctors and nurses - we do. Our system of GPs is a cornerstone of quality health care. If one has serious, acute illness or injury, NHS care is often as good as anywhere in the world. </p> <p>So what is the difference?</p> <p>The difference is that in other developed countries there are more doctors and nurses. Patients don't expect to wait months for operations. They can often choose their doctor and their hospital. They aren't exposed to such a risk of MRSA infection. They expect clean and safe hospitals. They aren't admitted to mixed sex wards. They have more control over their healthcare.</p> <p>The differences between our healthcare and those of other countries are still too great. And the difference is because under Labour, although we've got first-class people they are working in a second-rate system. The NHS deserves better. The NHS needs reform.</p> <p>Reforms which mean the extra money for the NHS isn't wasted. So that funds get to the front-line. That the service isn't submerged in bureaucracy. That we recruit doctors and nurses three times faster than managers, not the other way round. Where hospitals don't have 41 different inspectors or 250 different targets. </p> <p>An NHS where it would not be possible for managers to overrule infection control teams who say a ward should be closed to be cleaned. </p> <p>An NHS which delivers care to clinical standards, not to government's political targets and is measured by the quality of service, not by absurd and misleading star ratings.</p> <p>An NHS where it would not be possible for an MRI scanner -which the Lottery paid for - to stand idle while the Health Department puts a mobile MRI in the car park once a week.</p> <p>A reformed NHS is one in which GPs once again have the ability to secure for their patients the healthcare they need. We did this for GP fundholders in the past. We must do it for every GP in the future.</p> <p>And on Dentistry. In a reformed NHS, instead of Mr Blair's failed promise five years ago to give everyone the chance to see an NHS dentist, we will give patients the means and dentists the incentive to put NHS dentistry back on the high-street. </p> <p>A reformed NHS is one which is accountable to patients not to bureaucrats. Where patients have more control over their health and more choice. Where patients have the Right to Choose.</p> <p>The Right to choose is central to reform.</p> <p>Choice is a powerful means to an end - to deliver the services patients need. And to create choice, information is essential. Getting more information about waiting times, infection rates on wards, clinical outcomes, the number of cancelled operations, whether there are mixed sex wards or single rooms, access and transport and patient's experiences at the hospital. Such information makes choice real.</p> <p>If, at the end of the day, we choose our local hospital, fine, that is our choice. But if you want to be treated in weeks rather than months, or one hospital has high infection rates on the ward, then you should be able to choose another hospital. Labour would restrict choice to the options decided by the bureaucracy. That is no choice.</p> <p>Ours is a practical choice. Armed with information, patients will be able to book treatments through their GP, at the hospital of their choice. As an NHS patient, their treatment will be free. The hospital may be a foundation hospital or a private one, but NHS care will be free, to NHS standards.</p> <p>If patients want extra services and to go private, but take the burden off the health service, then we will support that choice too, with half the NHS cost. That's a saving for the NHS and a fair deal for patients who would otherwise pay twice for their healthcare. It's a practical approach which will deliver further reductions in waiting lists for everyone.</p> <p>In a reformed NHS, Patient choice will stimulate investment and new capacity. It will determine the shape of the extra capacity which the health service needs to provide. Choice encourages patients to take responsibility for their care and improves the outcome of treatments. It promotes innovation. It forces hospitals to provide the infection-free wards which patients demand. It pushes down waiting times.</p> <p>And, If patients are among the 17 million in this country who live with a long-term illness, patient choice gives them information and control, with their GP, over their healthcare. The Right to Choose gives the most to those who today have least. For those with long-term diseases, those with mental illness, those in poverty, it is they who will have the entitlements to care, and the ability to influence the services they receive, which too often now are determined by a bureaucracy over which they have - quite literally - no control.</p> <p>In tomorrow's NHS, we will give a new focus to improving the Health of the Nation. We need a new focus on improving our public health. A focus which the Labour Party has lost. Public health has become fragmented. Confused and mixed messages from Labour Ministers have resulted in a crisis.</p> <p>The evidence is shocking.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> new HIV diagnoses and sexually transmitted infections have doubled;</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> rising numbers of TB cases - in parts of London, at virtually third world levels.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> MMR vaccination levels down to 80%;</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> high levels of smoking among teenagers, especially girls; and let me tell John Reid if he thinks smoking is \"one of life's small pleasures\" for a single mum on a council estate, he is both wrong and patronising.</p> <p>The tragic evidence goes on ...</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> young people in their 20s with cirrhosis of the liver because of binge-drinking;</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> high levels of drug abuse, while the Government sends out mixed messages on cannabis; and </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Rising levels of obesity, with risk of future diabetes, stroke and heart disease but no coherent or consistent effort by the Government to encourage sport and exercise in schools, to improve food labelling, to enable the food and drink industry and retailers to promote healthier foods.</p> <p>In tomorrow's NHS, I will be the Secretary of State for Public Health. Public health will be my personal priority. An independent Public Health Commission will gather the evidence and make recommendations. Local public health teams will ensure co-ordinated, consistent efforts, across private and public sectors to tackle the problems of poor sexual health, alcohol and drug abuse, smoking, poor housing and poverty. I will back that up with national campaigns and influence over national policies.</p> <p>The next Conservative government will be accountable for the Health of the Nation, but we will stop trying to run the day-to-day health service from desks in Whitehall. </p> <p>The NHS will be accountable to patients and to the public for the services they provide. I will be accountable to you for delivering the resources and the reform our NHS needs so badly. To achieve this will mean a 'timetable for action' on health from day one of the next Conservative government.</p> <p>On the first day, we will abolish central targets imposed on hospitals so doctors, nurses and managers will be able to run hospitals in the interests of patients.</p> <p>In the first week, we will prepare for the Right to Choose, including providing access to information on performance and infection rates in hospitals.</p> <p>In the first month, we will introduce legislation to free the NHS from Whitehall controls, to provide mental health services with the framework they need, and to establish our Health of the Nation strategy.</p> <p>So, what will be the character of tomorrow's NHS under the Conservatives?</p> <p>Focused on improving the Health of the Nation. Delivering care which responds directly to patients' needs and choices. Where clinical standards and the evidence of effectiveness determine care, not political targets: where patient's interests come first. A service in which there is leadership and management, not bureaucracy, blame and buck-passing. </p> <p>A GP told me recently about the vision of healthcare promoted by the Institute for Health Improvement in Boston. Of course, the NHS has always had a vision. A vision of equal access, of healthcare for all. A service based on need not ability to pay. That vision will endure but it will not suffice. </p> <p>There is no room in tomorrow's NHS for an equality of misery. We must look to an NHS which pursues the highest standards. </p> <p>Standards which mean:</p> <p>no needless pain; no needless harm; no needless death; no needless waiting; no waste; Dignity and choice for patients; and Respect and reward for healthcare professionals.</p> <p>I can see an NHS in which first-class doctors and nurses are empowered to deliver first class care. Where compassion, choice and competition combine to deliver excellence.</p> <p>A vision for quality.</p> <p>A vision for tomorrow's NHS.</p> <p>A vision of an NHS which we will be proud once again to call the envy of the world.</p>",
  "<p>Is Nintendo's dominance of the handheld gaming market about to come to an end? Will Sony's much-touted <a href=\"http://www.us.playstation.com/pressreleases.aspx?id=207\">PSP</a> console squish the idiosyncratic <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/ds/index.jsp\">Nintendo DS</a>? The Guardian's business section examines this very issue today - check the story out right <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,1319691,00.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>I think there's room in the market for both, but in terms of predicting the biggest seller, this fight is going to come down to five main issues:</p> <p><strong>Playability</strong> Both machines offer impressive tech specs, but technology is nothing without the games to showcase it, and as you'd expect, both Sony and Nintendo are bringing some strong licenses into the ring. PSP will see the likes of Metal Gear Acid, Gran Turismo Mobile and WipeOut Pure. DS gets Mario 64x4, Metroid Prime Hunters and Animal Crossing. Okay, so Sony's is the more instantly recognisable line-up, but the question is, how easily will these brands make the transition to a handheld environment? Nintendo has considerable experience in shrinking its major franchises to mobile proportions. Sony doesn't. But then Sony had no real experience in videogame hardware before launching PlayStation and promptly battering Sega's Saturn to death.</p> <p><strong>Connectivity</strong> Both consoles feature 802.11b compatibility allowing wireless multiplayer gaming - although the DS also boasts a, 'proprietary communication protocol, which provides low battery consumption'. To counter, PSP adds Memory Stick support (perhaps for storing music and image files) and USB 2.0 so you should be able to attach it to other Sony gadgets.</p> <p><strong>Novelty</strong> PSP is set to be a complete multimedia entertainment solution as useful for watching movies (the console's Universal Media Discs can hold two hours of DVD quality video) and listening to music (7.1 channels and 3D sound support) as playing games. Meanwhile, DS features a touch screen that will give players a new way to interact with game menus and characters, and a built in microphone for voice commands. There are two completely different philosophies at work here. Sony is saying, 'yeah, we do games, but we do other cool stuff as well'. Nintendo is saying 'DS will do games in completely new and interesting ways'. Both are valid and interesting - depending on what you want to get out of your handheld gaming device.</p> <p><strong>Portability</strong> PSP dimensions are 170mm x 74mm x 23mm with a weight of 260g. DS weighs in at 148.7 x 84.7mm X 28.9mm and 275g (including battery &amp; stylus) making Nintendo's machine slightly shorter and chubbier - the latter due to a clam shell design that harks back to the days of the multiscreen <a href=\"http://www.gameandwatch.com/\">Game And Watch</a>. So, the PSP will fit better in your pocket, but the DS has a protected screen. And a stylus! In terms of battery life, Nintendo reckons you'll get 6-10 hours of gameplay from a fully charged DS battery, while Sony has yet to announce an official figure, although rumours suggest it could be a more modest 2.5 hours of continuous play.</p> <p><strong>Affordability</strong> Sony Europe president Chris Deering recently told trade publication MCV that PSP would come in \"closer to \u00a3200 than \u00a3300.\" The Nintendo DS is launching in the US at $149.99 which will probably translate to \u00a3149.99 reflecting the loveable way in which manufacturers like to charge us more for things for no discernable reason. That's still likely to be \u00a380 cheaper than the PSP though.</p> <p>Okay so I've entirely glossed over elements such as graphics processors, CPUs, etc, but its easy to get seduced by the internals of these machines before you actually get to see the games. Don't be. All we can judge at the moment are the priorities of the manufacturers. And just as in the 'battle' between PS2 and GameCube, Sony's machine has the sex appeal and the big brands, while Nintendo has the quirky ideas and near-autistic focus on game design. It should be an interesting scrap.</p>",
  "The Tory party policy coordinator's speech at the Independent fringe meeting, entitled \"How do the Conservatives win this time?\" <p>You've given me 5 minutes.</p> <p>Let me try it in a sentence.</p> <p>By emphasising the Conservative values that the vast majority of the British public share, by turning them into Conservative polices - and by showing how we would put them in to action.</p> <p>In other words: values, policies and action.</p> <p>Before expanding on that let me say how we don't win.</p> <p>We don't win by a fruitless search for differences between us and our opponents where none really exist. It's opportunist Punch and Judy politics. It's unattractive and it doesn't work. </p> <p>We have to forget about what Blair is going to say tomorrow or the next day. I don't know what he's going to say. He doesn't know what he is going to say. </p> <p>We should just get on and do what we think is right.</p> <p>Second, we won't win by picking one subject - whether it is Europe or anything else - and talking about it incessantly. People want their political parties to tackle the broad range of issues that they care about. In the main that means schools, hospitals, crime, immigration and the economy. </p> <p>If you don't sound balanced, you won't seem balanced.</p> <p>Third, we won't win by being exclusively negative. People now know they have been let down by Labour. We reminded them of that- quite rightly- during the local election campaign. They don't need anymore reminders from us. And every reminder we send probably says as much about us as it does about them. </p> <p>It's time to accentuate the positive...</p> <p>So, back to the simple formulation - values, policies and action.</p> <p>Above all we have to recognise that the biggest problem in British politics today is cynicism, apathy and disillusion. They are the enemy, not Labour or the Liberals.</p> <p>How many times have we all heard on the doorstep - \"you're all the same\", \"you won't make any difference\", ending with the question: \"what's the point?\"</p> <p>Judging from the turn out at general local and by-elections, most people's answer to that last question - \"what's the point?\" - is that there isn't any.</p> <p>Labour and the Conservatives are marooned on broadly the same poll rating, somewhere in the low 30s. </p> <p>They're there because they've let people down. We're there because people don't yet think that we will make any difference. The Liberals are doing well, more than anything else, because they are not either of us.</p> <p>But I'm upbeat.</p> <p>There are three questions that matter in terms of political success. </p> <p>Do people share your values?</p> <p>Do they agree with you about what's wrong?</p> <p>And do they think you have the right plans for doing something about it?</p> <p>The answer to the first question about values is good for the Conservatives. Why else do you think the focus group obsessed Labour party has been so timid?</p> <p>Should crime be punished or tolerated? Does Britain do best when it is control of its own destiny? </p> <p>Are families the key building block of a stable society? Does equality of opportunity matter more than equality of outcome? Are our institutions a source of strength not a cause of weakness?</p> <p>Should we encourage people to do more for themselves when they can? </p> <p>All value questions - and all get a Conservative answer almost anywhere in the country you care to ask them.</p> <p>Answers to questions about what is wrong in Blair's Britain are just as encouraging. </p> <p>Here I admit, we've checked with polls and focus groups. </p> <p>Do people think that crime is rising and the hands of the police are tied by bureaucracy and paperwork? Yes.</p> <p>Do people think that hospital managers and head teachers are too busy looking up to Whitehall to manage effectively? Yes.</p> <p>Do people feel over-taxed and in awe of third-term tax rises and a \u00a32,000 council tax. Yes. They don't just think these taxes are coming if Labour win again - they know they are coming.</p> <p>So that brings us to the big one - \"do people agree with our plans?\" </p> <p>First, they don't know enough - if anything at all - about them. </p> <p>Second, even if they do, because of the wall of cynicism and disillusion, they don't believe we will achieve them.</p> <p>That's why the Timetable of Action being published this week is so important. It will tell you what we will do in the first day, the first week, the first month. </p> <p>It gives you details of the first queen's speech and the first budget. It is about being accountable. </p> <p>It is about people feeling that they are in charge again, and not the politicians. To make sure we are the servants, not the masters.</p> <p>Two last points.</p> <p>Does the Conservative party need to modernise itself? </p> <p>Yes, of course. If you don't understand the complexities and changing nature of modern society you are irrelevant. </p> <p>If you don't address the modern concerns of a modern country, you are dead. </p> <p>Second, by saying that most people in this country share broadly Conservative values, have I said enough? </p> <p>No. We have to make sure that we include all of those values.</p> <p>That we have a vision of society. That we believe we have obligations unto each other. That there is a net beneath which no one should fall. That there is a \"we\" as well as a \"me\".</p> <p>As I look at a Labour government that is closing special schools for disabled children, that is throwing wardens out of sheltered accommodation schemes, that endlessly threatens community hospitals, that offers drug addicts the sort of treatment place that is worse than useless and that crushes the voluntary and charitable sectors with its belief that \"Society is the State\" - nothing more, nothing less - there has never been a greater need for Conservatives to explain our view of society, our obligations to each other and our compassion for those in need.</p> <p>And with everything I've said - I hope we can inject some passion - as well as compassion - into what we say at the same time. </p> <p>So how do we win? </p> <p>Values, policies and action.</p> <p>Who knows? If we follow this with passion as well as discipline, people might just listen.</p>",
  "Michael Howard will today make a dramatic attempt to win the trust of disillusioned voters by promising to sack cabinet ministers who fail to deliver the detailed election promises on target. <p>In a self-lacerating address to the party faithful and the wider television audience, the Conservative leader will admit during his speech to the party's conference in Bournemouth: \"Politicians seem to live in a different world, where promises are dropped just as casually as they are made, a world where there are no penalties for failure.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard received a boost today when it emerged that Paul Sykes, the Yorkshire millionaire who has been the main Ukip financial backer, has fallen out with Robert Kilroy-Silk over his wholehearted endorsement of the party's weekend decision to \"kill off\" the Conservatives. </p> <p>Mr Sykes, who contributed nearly half of Ukip's \u00a32m fighting fund for this year's European elections, said the policy of fielding candidates who could unseat Eurosceptic Tory MPs at the next election meant he could no longer support them. The decision will be a huge relief to Mr Howard and a reward for his hardline policy on Europe. </p> <p>The news came as David Davis, the shadow home secretary, admitted Ukip had the ability to really damage Conservative fortunes, estimating they could cost as many seats as the Referendum party in 1997 - between 30 and 50. Mr Sykes, who has welcomed Mr Howard's tougher line on Europe, said Ukip had \"blown it\". </p> <p>The Conservative leader will break with tradition by making his keynote conference speech on a Tuesday, much as Labour leaders have long done, as part of his desperate attempt to restore momentum and credibility to a party battered by defeat for a decade. </p> <p>The detailed \"timetable for action\" which the Tories are publishing in daily instalments includes \"specific times, specific dates, no wriggle room\", Mr Howard will say, a day after his chief lieutenant, Oliver Letwin, promised smaller government and lower taxes - without yet being specific. </p> <p>Mr Howard will say: \"Everyone will be able to hold us to account, no dodgy facts and figures, we'll have no place to hide. I'll choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver. And if they don't I'll replace them with people who will.\" It would be a hostage to fortune if Mr Howard's prospects were better, although Lord Saatchi, his party co-chairman, said in Bournemouth that, if there was a snap election this autumn, his private polling suggested there would be a hung parliament. </p> <p>But as the Conservative leader put the finishing touches to his speech in the wake of yesterday's Times/Populus poll which put him in worse shape than the purged Iain Duncan Smith a year ago, a fresh poll for BBC Newsnight heaped further gloom on him. </p> <p>Only 12% of voters believe Mr Howard, now 63, will ever be prime minister, with even 65% of Tory supporters among the 78% overall doubters. Nearly twice as many people believe the Lib Dems are a more effective opposition, 42% compared with 22%. Mr Howard's recent anti-war stance over Iraq is widely attributed to mere point-scoring. The Times poll showed his party slipping back, on 28% to Labour's 35%, barely above the Lib Dems on 25%. </p> <p>Mr Howard's private polling almost certainly confirms such alarming impressions and is likely to have prompted today's masochistic admission of past error, as well as what is billed as a \"highly personal section\" about the core of his beliefs. This confessional section will also include detail about the death of his mother-in-law more than two years ago as a result of a hospital-acquired infection. \"It's a tragedy for thousands of families - including mine,\" Mr Howard plans to say. </p> <p>With senior Tories trumpeting the \"right to choose\" in public services as the real road to social justice, one flagship Tory initiative to pave the way for tax cuts was cast into doubt last night hours after being deployed in a conference video. </p> <p>To the delight of Labour, Tim Yeo, shadow transport and environment secretary, made clear that he would not be bound by a party special review of government spending by one-time Dome troubleshooter David James which has so far identified \u00a315bn pounds of savings in government spending. These will eventually be used to fund tax cuts. Mr Yeo told the environment magazine ENDS Report: \"It isn't a priority for me.\"</p>",
  "Blair is bad for business. <p>As soon as this government sees a profitable company, they want to tax it.</p> <p>Then they want to regulate it.</p> <p>Then they want to tell it what to do.</p> <p>Above all they want to tell it what it mustn't do.</p> <p>If press releases made us rich we would now be the richest country in the world.</p> <p>If bossy ministers made you top the economic league tables we would be world leaders already. If higher taxes bought you happiness this country would be smiling all the way to the Treasury.</p> <p>The trouble with Labour is they are all talk and no action.</p> <p>Or, sometimes, when it comes to business, fine words and foul deeds.</p> <p>Do you remember the promise not to increase taxes?</p> <p>Sixty six tax increases later that's worn a bit thin.</p> <p>Or do you remember the promise that the EU is coming our way?</p> <p>That the EU would switch from bossing us to death to getting out of the way and stimulating enterprise?</p> <p>Unfortunately, Labour forgot to tell the Commission.</p> <p>Do you remember when they said they wanted to deregulate?</p> <p>How that became the wish to regulate better whilst in practice all they did was regulate more and more?</p> <p>This government's record.</p> <p>Trying to run Network Rail, re-branding the Post Office as Consignia and organising the Dome has led to one thing in each case -disastrous results.</p> <p>It was our money they threw away on bankrupting Railtrack. Our money they used to run up huge losses on the postal monopoly.</p> <p>Our money they threw down the drain on an empty Dome.</p> <p>Letting Labour run business is as successful as putting Tony Blair into Wimbledon or asking me to sing at Covent Garden.</p> <p>It's because they don't have any feel for business that they want to regulate it to death. Many of their regulations are well intentioned yet they add up to a swingeing \u00a330,000 million a year. But all so often they turn out to be the sledgehammer that misses the nut or the sledgehammer that smashes the nut completely.</p> <p>Let's look at a few examples.</p> <p>In the last seven years there has been a huge increase in pensions regulation.</p> <p>The aim is a good one - to give people more security in their old age based on their own savings.</p> <p>What has happened?</p> <p>The last five years have been the worst five years for pension funds on record.</p> <p>Many funds have closed down altogether.</p> <p>Most funds have big deficits.</p> <p>Many funds have closed themselves to new members.</p> <p>Far from strengthening pensions, Government regulation has failed to prevent a collapse.</p> <p>Why has this happened?</p> <p>Because the Regulators could not stand up to the source of the damage.</p> <p>The decline was triggered by the Chancellor himself taking \u00a35 billion every year out of the hands of pensioners and other scheme members. It is typical of this rip off government.</p> <p>What's the point of massive expensive regulation to stop robbery from funds</p> <p>when they can't stop the real robber - the Government itself?</p> <p>In the past seven years, there has been a further run down in our fishing industry. Instead of draconian regulation, protecting our fish and rebuilding our fisheries, we are told there has been further pillaging of our seas.</p> <p>The EU and the Government together insist that small fish and the wrong kinds of fish caught in a net have to thrown back dead into the sea in the name of conservation! You couldn't make up anything so daft even if you were writing a parody.</p> <p>No wonder we are short of fish in the fishmongers and in the sea when the regulators encourage fish mortality but discourage landing them to eat.</p> <p>Or consider the plight of the poor motorist.</p> <p>Now I have a confession to make. I am a motorist. I know the government would like us off the road. I know they think I and many like me are the real criminals. But I have a simple message for the Government.</p> <p>Most of us need a car to do our jobs, to help our families to get around. Most of us try to obey the rules. We are fed up with speed cameras that are there to make money.</p> <p>Once again, the Government's regulators have achieved the opposite of what was intended. They set out with the noble plan to cut accidents. Instead, five years in to the camera madness, deaths are up on our roads and the Government has had to admit that speed is not the prime cause of accidents.</p> <p>Indeed, they have had to admit it is only a cause in a small minority of cases.</p> <p>The government should have targeted those who steal cars, drive without insurance or road tax and flout the safety rules of the road with impunity.</p> <p>You know all this.</p> <p>Our thoughts are the same as most people in Britain.</p> <p>Regulation is over the top and often self defeating.</p> <p>I have more government than I want.</p> <p>More government than I need.</p> <p>More government than I can afford.</p> <p>So what can the Conservatives do about it?</p> <p>A Conservative government, would, from its first day in office, set about removing the worst regulations. The ones that make life difficult without making it better. The ones that miss the nut or smash it altogether.</p> <p>In the first hour, Ministers in the new government will explain to officials that we are not in the business of passing four thousand new laws a year.</p> <p>If a department wants a new law, it will have to explain why. It will have to tell us how much it costs and it will have to say what it could repeal or remove at the same time.</p> <p>From the first day, we have to stop the flow, change the automatic assumption that there is a legislative answer to every risk and that every front page story can launch a new Statutory Instrument. </p> <p>In the first week, departments will be asked to bring forward their contribution to the great deregulation bill. My colleagues and I have already sunk a few bottles of wine in the cause of constructing a programme.</p> <p>In the first four weeks, we will draw up our first list of unwanted EU regulations ready to take to Brussels as part of our renegotiation. We cannot live with their draft Constitution nor with many of the expensive rules they impose on us.</p> <p>In the first year we will put a major deregulation bill through Parliament.</p> <p>That's where I need your help today.</p> <p>In the next few weeks, I am compiling a list of items for repeal and amendment to go in that legislation.</p> <p>I am spoilt for choice.</p> <p>Not all bad regulations have been invented in the last seven years. The previous Conservative government was not blameless in all this. But you and I know that if we had a Snowdon of regulation in 1997, we now have an Everest.</p> <p>It's the cumulative impact. The piling of control on control that eventually overwhelms all but the hardiest of entrepreneurs. </p> <p>This government decided to regulate window installers. They introduced a scheme called FENSA which meant much more paperwork and expense for anyone wanting to keep warm in winter.</p> <p>They joined with Brussels to regulate herbal medicines and food supplements off our shelves when many of these products are popular. And they now make everyone with a horse buy a horse passport even though we don't usually eat horsemeat in Britain.</p> <p>These are the kind of things we need to put right. </p> <p>Tony Blair promised to run a business friendly government. He and his friends murdered a good shoal of crustaceans on his famous prawn cocktail offensive to win business over.</p> <p>Today I doubt they would be allowed to do that as the fat controllers move into what we eat and tell us to survive on lettuce leaves.</p> <p>Blair has let us down.</p> <p>We want to set people free.</p> <p>Conservatives understand that Government does not always know best.</p> <p>Conservatives want you to be governed less and governed better.</p> <p>Conservatives have a timetable for action.</p>",
  "<p>Why, I have often wondered, can Britain not produce a John Grisham or a Scott Turow, practising lawyers who can write huge international bestsellers set in the legal world and with a lawyer as hero, or at least central character? And while Grisham and Turow may be the best known, there is a long list of American lawyer-authors selling vast quantities of crime fiction, thrillers and courtroom dramas. </p> <p>Why aren't our lawyers doing the same? They are, after all, trained in the use of words and in logical thinking just as much as their American counterparts, and they have just as much inside knowledge of, and access to, the profession they're in and the system they serve. I offer my theory later. </p> <p>Coincidentally, in the past three weeks, no fewer than five already established British lawyer-writers have had new novels published which, given the paucity of lawyers who have managed to write fiction more or less successfully, is a veritable avalanche: Crown prosecutor Frances Fyfield, criminal barrister Jonathan Davies QC, solicitor Martin Edwards, legal academic Alexander McCall Smith, and national legal institution Sir John Mortimer have written books far apart from each other in content and characters. </p> <p>Only one is an out-and-out courtroom drama, Davies' The Piano Factory, the fifth appearance by criminal barrister Jeremy Scott. This time, he's outraged when his client, whom he believes to be innocent, is convicted of child molesting because of a technical quirk in the law. Scott sheds his professional garb and ethics to find out for himself and clear his client's name. </p> <p>Fyfield is by far the best of the lawyer-writers, the only one in the top division of crime fiction. Her main series character, Helen West, is a prosecutor, and Fyfield still works one day a week at the Crown Prosecution Service to make sure she's up-to-date with legal developments. Needless to say, the professional details in the West series are meticulously accurate, as are her descriptions of the social milieu in which the crimes take place. Fyfield's most recent book, Looking Down, features another lawyer, the eccentric Sarah Fortune, but in her sleuthing rather than legal capacity. Fortune spends a good part of her time as a mistress to several men, an activity not usually catered for in the law school syllabus. </p> <p>Edwards, head of employment law at the Liverpool solicitors' firm Mace &amp; Jones, created the louche, somewhat down-at-heel Liverpool solicitor Harry Devlin, hero of seven first-rate novels taking him into the seedy innards of the city. His latest novel, The Coffin Trail, is not a Harry Devlin but an engrossingly creepy crime thriller set in the Lake District. </p> <p>The amazing international triumph of McCall Smith's series, set in Botswana and introducing Precious Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has forced him to take a lengthy sabbatical from his job as professor of medical law at Edinburgh University. His latest book, The Sunday Philosophy Club, is a departure, a gentle, old-fashioned, elegantly written mystery set in the Scottish capital. </p> <p>Mortimer has a lot to answer for. Clearly, in terms of sales and television adaptations, his Rumpole of the Bailey stories have made him the most successful British lawyer writing about other lawyers. The 15th Rumpole - the first full novel - may be the last. Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders finally reveals details of the case, often referred to in the other stories, which so influenced his early career at the bar. But, marvellously entertaining though he has been for so long, Horace Rumpole has performed one great disservice. Millions of readers and television viewers all over the world believe that our lawyers, our judges and our legal system have been accurately portrayed in the Rumpole series. Alas, the reality is not as cosy or comic. </p> <p>Apart from the five above, I found it difficult to muster two handfuls of active or recently active lawyers who have turned to writing decent fiction (a long ago law degree or a brief youthful spell in legal practice doesn't count). </p> <p>Earlier this year Caro Fraser, a former shipping lawyer, published her 11th book, A Calculating Heart, on the animated goings-on - sexual and legal - in a fictional set of barristers' chambers. Dexter Dias, a criminal barrister in the prominent civil liberties chambers 2 Garden Court, has had a good run of courtroom thrillers since the mid-1990s. He's currently writing his seventh. Elizabeth Woodcraft, from Michael Mansfield's chambers, has barrister Frankie Richmond, streetwise, sharp and chaotic, as her main character in two recent books. </p> <p>Nicola Williams, now a lawyer with the Independent Police Complaints commission, made a terrific impression in 1997 with her debut novel Without Prejudice and its sparkling black barrister heroine, but only now is a second book in the pipeline. </p> <p>Former City solicitor Philip Jolowicz has done well with two fast-paced financial thrillers, and QC and MP Bob Marshall-Andrews' A Man Without Guilt is a creditable kidnapping story with a legal backdrop. I should also mention Lord Rawlinson, a former attorney general, who, in retirement from politics, wrote three pacy courtroom dramas. </p> <p>The most unexpectedly successful recent lawyer-author of whodunnits was Sarah Caudwell, who wrote only four books before her death in 2000, the last published posthumously. Her detectives were a bunch of young Chancery barristers, led by an Oxford don. They all spoke in complicated, highly mannered fashion, even when on holiday, solving murders or talking about sex. Surprisingly, her books, riddled with near-impenetrable legal language, were more popular in the US than here. </p> <p>Going further back, Cyril Hare (the pseudonym of a barrister, later county court judge) wrote, in 1942, what is still among the best whodunnits set in the legal world, Tragedy at Law. Henry Cecil, another county court judge, became popular in the 1950s with several light novels, mainly about the tribulations and adventures of young barristers and the absurdities of the law. Many of them converted pleasantly into film, television and radio. I found re-reading Cecil recently difficult work. His kind of humour has dated. The prolific Michael Gilbert, a solicitor, wrote intelligent, superior crime fiction, both in and out of legal settings, for more than 50 years. </p> <p>I've listed some 16 lawyer-authors who have made an impact, even if limited, on public consciousness and sales figures. Not a large haul from a profession that might be expected to provide a substantial body of talented recruits to the writing trade. I'm sure I've omitted some, but not so as to upset my general point. So why then, so few? </p> <p>Here's the thesis. To practise the law in Britain requires learning a new language, Lawspeak. It's not just a question of knowing specific legal terms or jargon. The whole structure of a sentence changes. The tense is largely passive, long words are preferred to short ones and convoluted locutions are de rigueur. The trouble is that when lawyers then try to write fiction - in a voice understandable to the general reading public - they find it difficult to make the transition. It's a problem many lawyers also have when they appear on television or radio. However knowledgeable they are on the subject, translating it from Lawspeak into ordinary speech is often beyond them. </p> <p>Moreover, lawyers can't write dialogue. In my role as a reviewer of crime fiction, I was once sent a manuscript for a thriller from a lawyer acquaintance. The plot was fine, the descriptions well written, the action fast. Only, whenever anyone said anything - Croatian terrorist, French femme fatale or London taxi-driver - it sounded like a lawyer speaking. </p> <p>In contrast, American lawyers still talk in understandable American. When they write fiction, they do not need to shed their legal carapace and make a special effort to change from Lawspeak into the language of their readers. Of course courtroom dramas and legal thrillers will contain some legal terminology, but skilful writers like Grisham use them to mount simple explanations and to give the reader an insider's feel for the legal system. </p> <p>It's getting better. There is an official policy to get rid of Latin sayings and to write legal documents in plain English. Progress is slow. The move is being resisted in many solicitors' offices and barristers' chambers. The next letter you get from your lawyer will still probably be incomprehensible. But at least there's a realisation by the professions that they need to be more linguistically accessible to their clients. You can expect, in time, to understand what lawyers say and write. An English John Grisham may be only decades away.</p>",
  "Rock star Bryan Ferry was booed and jeered by his fellow musicians at the Q awards ceremony as he spoke in support of his son, Otis, one of eight pro-hunt demonstrators who stormed the House of Commons in September, angered by the government's plan to ban fox-hunting. <p>Collecting the award for lifetime achievement for his band Roxy Music, Ferry announced: \"I would like to dedicate this award to my brave son Otis.\" The audience, which included U2, Sir Elton John and Elvis Costello, was audibly unreceptive.</p> <p>Until yesterday, Ferry had declined to comment on his son's involvement with the pro-hunt lobby and in particular the events of September 15, when the protesters succeeded in sneaking into the Commons dressed as construction workers before storming the floor of the house.</p> <p>Former public schoolboy Otis, 21, is the country's youngest master of the foxhounds, following his appointment at the South Shropshire Hunt last May.</p> <p>Raised in Sussex, he left Marlborough school at 16 to become an apprentice whipper-in at the Middleton Hunt in North Yorkshire.</p> <p>The incident at the Commons was not his first brush with the law in the name of the fox-hunting: two years ago, he was arrested when found lurking around the prime minister's constituency home in Trimden, Co Durham. Apparently, he had been planning to decorate the house in pro-hunt stickers.</p> <p>Earlier this year, in an interview with The Field magazine, Ferry, referring to the incident in 2002, described how he wished he had encountered the prime minister that night.</p> <p>\"I would like to have heard why he feels he has the right to ruin so many lives,\" he said, \"especially mine.\" Bryan Ferry's former wife - and Otis's mother - Lucy, has also been involved in the pro-hunt protests.</p> <p>She received a 12-month conditional discharge at Bow Street magistrates' court last month, for her part in September's pro-hunt demonstrations outside Parliament.</p> <p>The socialite and fomer model subsequently pledged that the pro-hunting campaigners would bring down the government.</p> <p>\"It was a political statement. I am very angry and so are thousands and thousands of other people.</p> <p>\"This bill is an attack on the freedom of a minority of people,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We are disgusted by Mr Blair's lies and we can bring this government down.\"</p> <p>Bryan Ferry, 59, famous for his lounge lizard image as well as for hits such as Love is the Drug and Avalon, has not taken any active involvement in the pro-hunt campaign.</p>",
  "<p>The Tories pledged today to scrap the beleaguered family court service in a bid to ensure fathers and grandparents get better access to their children.</p> <p>In a clear nod to the cause championed by activist group Fathers4Justice, the shadow spokeswoman for families, Theresa May, promised to axe the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass).</p> <p>In a separate move, she also pledged to replace the family court system with a new mediation service.</p> <p>Ms May called the introduction of Cafcass under Labour \"the biggest mistake in family policy\", and said her party would seek to abolish it to end \"the heartbroken stories\" of parents denied fair access to their kids. </p> <p>\"It is a bureaucratic shambles, it is deeply unjust and it is letting families down,\" she said.</p> <p>In a confused message she blamed Cafcass for decisions actually made by family courts. The role of Cafcass is to coordinate the work of guardians who support children involved in custody disputes.</p> <p>The body has been beset with problems since the decision to abolish the self-employed status of guardians, which led to many leaving the service.</p> <p>Ms May said that within the first month of a Tory government, a bill would be drawn up giving a \"presumption of co-parenting and a right for both parents to be involved in bringing up their children where couples separate\".</p> <p>\"We will ensure that the law serves the best interest of the child - and children deserve to see both parents.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Courts should be the last resort, not the first. The aim will be to intervene early to make sure disputes don't have to go to court but are sorted out quickly in the best interests of the children.\"</p> <p>In an apparent reference to situations involving domestic violence, Ms May added that \"child safety will remain a priority\".</p> <p>She also struck an inclusive note for families, acknowledging unmarried and gay couples as families - while still asserting the Tory preference for marriage as \"the best environment for bringing up children\".</p> <p>Tacitly conceding previous Tory failures to \"properly\" represent family in government, which is placed \"under threat as never before\", Ms May nevertheless failed to announce anything else directly targeting families or women.</p> <p><strong> Drop in female vote</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, a report out today claimed that the Conservative party is going in \"reverse gear\" in its bid to woo women voters, further dimming its prospects at the next general election.</p> <p>Only a quarter of women voters are satisfied with Michael Howard's performance, with his tenure more popular among male voters, according to a report published today by the Fawcett Society.</p> <p>Dr Katherine Rake, director of the Fawcett Society, said: \"This report shows that the Conservatives still have a long way to go if they want to win back women's votes. </p> <p>\"The party urgently needs to formulate convincing policies that will appeal to the female electorate if they are to recover electorally. And in order for these policies to be credible, they must be presented and delivered by more women.\"</p> <p><strong>Increasing female representation</strong><br></p> <p>Tory delegate Joan Spiers said that more female Tories in senior positions would be unlikely because of an unfair selection process. </p> <p>\"I would like to see an even-handed deal,\" she said. \"The selection process is usually the twin-set-and-pearls brigade and a lot of men. If they get a young, attractive, striving young woman they often reject her. I have often heard people say, 'you should be at home with your children'.\"</p> <p>Surrey county councillor Marian Myland agreed: \"I want to see them do more,\" she said. \"I want to them to say something about women's problems that they are not yet addressing, such as more tax breaks for childcare and elderly care and education.\"</p> <p>Crawley Tory councillor Kirstie Heal disagreed, however: \"The ethos of the Tory party for me is equal to men and women. </p> <p>\"It is about families, it is about supporting small government. I believe this applies to all ages. It is a worry for me that the policies are not appealing. When we were canvassing we didn't find women found that. They were equally as engaged as men.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Conservative government would outlaw smoking in public places if companies failed to be coaxed into voluntary bans, the shadow health spokesman, Andrew Murrison, said yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Murrison's admission that his party would \"not rule out\" legislation to ban public smoking undermines the \"laisser faire\" position previously taken by the Conservative party in the social realm, and will delight the health secretary, John Reid, who is wrestling with the politically-charged prospect of banning smoking in public places to protect people from secondary smoking.</p> <p>Mr Murrison, the shadow spokesman for public services, made his comments at a fringe meeting jointly sponsored by the Adam Smith Institute and health thinktank the King's Fund on ways to improve the nation's health.</p> <p>Mr Murrisson, formerly a doctor, said health initiatives supported by a Conservative government would have to be evidence-based. He appeared as yet unconvinced about the evidence that secondary smoking is a public health menace.</p> <p>But pressed by the session's chair, Niall Dickson, the former BBC social affairs correspondent on the strong evidence of the impact on people's health through passive smoking, Mr Murrison said if the evidence based was there, the Conservative party would act.</p> <p>He pointed as an example to the mandatory introduction of seatbelts under a Conservative government, brought in after evidence showed a vast reduction in fatalities.</p> <p>\"There was clear evidence at the time that seatbelts improved public health, and it worked. We have to play off our strong libertarian instincts with our desire to improve people's lives,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think what we would do as Tories is do our utmost to have a voluntary code with the hospitality industry but with something like that ... I would certainly not close the door on some form of legislation if we were convinced and the evidence was strong enough and the hospitality failed to join us.\"</p> <p>But he said the decision to ban smoking should not be devolved down to individual councils to decide. \"The whole thing would be very patchy,\" he said. \"It is simply the government side-stepping the issue.\"</p> <p>Mr Murrison also flagged up the Tory aspiration to devolve the \"microcosm\" of health down to local practitioners, with public health paradoxically \"gripped centrally\".</p> <p>Praising the introduction of the national service frameworks and the national institute of clinical excellence to oversee standards in healthcare, introduced under New Labour, Mr Murrison said the health secretary's job should be as \"the bloke in charge of the national health\" with a strategic public health role. </p> <p>Mr Murrison also called for a return to the \"pre-1974\" model when local government played a far stronger part in the delivery of health.</p>",

  "<p>Oxford University is today renewing its high court bid to impose a 35 metre 'no harassment' zone around its buildings to guard against animal rights activists. </p> <p>Last month, Mr Justice Simon was told that the university was not seeking to curb peaceful protest and was offering to provide a demonstration area immediately opposite its new biomedical research laboratory site in South Parks Road. </p> <p>The hearing was adjourned until today to give the defendants time to prepare their evidence. </p> <p>Work on the construction of the laboratory stopped on July 13 because contractors faced harassment and intimidation from parts of the animal rights movement, said solicitor-advocate Timothy Lawson-Cruttenden, for the university. </p> <p>The proposed injunction would not interfere with peaceful freedom of speech or freedom of association, he said, although limits should be imposed on the use of shouting and musical instruments to distract people from their laboratory work. </p> <p>There were signs that the animal rights campaign was \"getting out of control\", said Mr Lawson-Cruttenden. </p> <p>The injunction was sought against 10 named defendants: </p> <p>Mel Broughton, John Curtin, Robert Cogswell, Speak Campaigns, Stop Primate Experimentation at Cambridge, Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, Oxford Animal Rights Group, People Against Cruelty to Animals - West Midlands, West Midlands Animal Action and Animal Liberation Front. </p> <p>The injunction would not affect the \"traditional\" demonstration area in the Carfax district of Oxford. </p> <p>But demonstrations opposite the laboratory site would be restricted to a maximum of 25 protesters and limited to four hours with the police given 24 hours' notice. </p> <p>This would effectively continue the present arrangement under which weekly demonstrations had been held each Thursday for the past six months. </p> <p>The university was not seeking to prevent protest processions as long as they had permission under the Public Order Act. </p> <p>Oxford has become the new focus for animal rights groups after plans for a multimillion-pound laboratory at Cambridge were abandoned earlier this year because of the excessive costs of protecting staff. </p> <p>The \u00a318m facility would use animals for testing with 98% of its work involving rodents, and the remainder being amphibians, fish, ferrets and primates. </p> <p>Mr Lawson-Cruttenden said the proposed injunction, under the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act, sought to establish the correct balance between two opposing interests. </p> <p>It would prohibit the defendants from \"assaulting, molesting, harassing, threatening, pestering, shouting at or otherwise interfering with\" the university's members, students, employees and contractors (including shareholders) or their families. </p> <p>Photographing the \"protected persons\" or their vehicles would be banned, as would the use of loud hailers and instruments to make artificial or musical noise \"whether or not designed for the purpose\". </p> <p>Abusive or threatening communications - whether orally or by letter, fax, telephone or email - would also be barred. </p> <p>The protesters would be banned from entering any of the university's buildings and grounds, and from \"picketing, demonstrating or loitering\" within exclusion zones around the claimants' homes and the premises of building contractors. </p> <p>The university also asked the judge to prohibit the defendants from publishing the names, addresses, car registrations or other information which would identify the persons protected by the injunction. </p> <p>Today's hearing is before Mr Justice Grigson.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Blair in Africa, Britain's Guantanamo and a canine escapologist</p> <p><b>BOURNEMOUTH BLUES</b></p> <p>It is perhaps an index of the Conservative party's decline that one of only two papers to report their conference on the front page is their traditional opponent, the Guardian. Perhaps more worrisome still is the attitude of its traditional friends. The Times runs a cartoon of a man looking through a Bournemouth telescope with the caption \"Watch the Tories, 50p a laugh\", and the Telegraph concentrates its attention on events within Ukip.</p> <p>The Guardian's front page report quotes from today's leaked speech by Michael Howard, in which the Tory leader attempts to restore some credibility to politics by promising to sack ministers who fail to deliver election pledges. \"Politicians seem to live in a different world, where promises are dropped just as casually as they are made,\" he is expected to say, \"a world where there are no penalties for failure.\" A cynic might suggest that this is one promise the electorate may not oblige Mr Howard to keep. Martin Kettle, writing on the Guardian comment pages, says the whole conference experience is like \"being in the Crystal Palace dressing room before a match with Arsenal\".</p> <p>Trust seems to be the keynote; Oliver Letwin, the shadow chancellor, \"pointedly refused to promise tax cuts,\" says the Telegraph leader, because \"nobody would believe him if he did.\" The Telegraph thinks Mr Letwin is on the right track, in \"assuming that voters are reasonable people who do not like being patronised\", and that his approach is in tune with a general Conservative strategy of not saying anything too striking, in an attempt to \"tickle\" the core Tory vote without scaring off floating voters. The Telegraph thinks that if Mr Letwin's message gets through, \"Labour could have a fight on its hands\". It is pretty much alone in thinking this, it has to be said.</p> <p>\"Tickling\" the core vote is all the more important as so much traditional support leaks to Ukip, so Tories will be cheered even more by the Telegraph's front page, which reports that a millionaire businessman has withdrawn his backing from Ukip after its decision to \"kill off\" the Conservative party by standing against it in every constituency, even those held by Eurosceptic Tory MPs. Paul Sykes had been expected to put substantial funds into Ukip's election campaign, but now says the party has \"blown it\". </p> <p>Apart from that silver lining, there's little cheer for Tories in the papers' rather jocular take on their conference. Peter Riddell in the Times says: \"Voters no longer hate the Conservatives, but they are not yet listening to them\", which would also work as an adequate description of the press's attitude. There's little outrage or excitement about Tory plans, and rather a lot of gently amused observation. </p> <p>The Guardian rather unkindly prints a picture of a man asleep in a double-breasted suit under the ironic headline Rallying the troops: The rejuvenated Troy party in Bournemouth. The Telegraph delights in an attempt to prove that the Tory front bench are \"hip dudes\" with details of their recent music purchases, and - alarmingly - their early romantic experiences. This incidentally gives it an excuse to run a picture of the singer Dido (a favourite of Nicholas Soames, apparently), something it is never loath to do. The Wrap was particularly tickled by Tim Collins's precision in revealing that his most recent CD purchase was Will Young ... for his wife, of course.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/conservatives2004/story/0,15018,1319870,00.html\">Howard - I'll sack ministers who break promises</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/conservatives2004/comment/0,15018,1319724,00.html\">The centre is up for grabs</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/05/ntory05.xml\">Telegraph: Millionaire backer drops Ukip</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17349-1295163,00.html\">Times: The voters still refuse to listen</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=IVPMW4EHOGXPZQFIQMGSM5WAVCBQWJVC?xml=/news/2004/10/05/ntory405.xml&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=61825\">Telegraph: Saatchi tries to give shadow cabinet a hip new image</a></p> <p><b>BLAIR IN AFRICA</b></p> <p>Meanwhile, the other party, it seems, is intent on taking over the world. Tony Blair is on a three-day trip to Africa, which the Times says is \"designed to demonstrate his vitality after heart treatment as much as his commitment to solving the problems of the world\". The Guardian, saving a front page piece about attempts to patch up Labour differences at the top with overtures to the chancellor Gordon Brown, takes the trip a little more seriously. It says Mr Blair will \"attempt to shape the agenda of the developed world towards Africa\" and \"produce a bold report that will shame the European Union and G8 into changing their trade, aid and conflict resolution rules\".</p> <p>That will involve shaming his old ally Peter Mandelson, according to a report in the Telegraph. It says Mr Mandelson reassured MEPs that from now on his commitment is to Europe, to the European parliament, and the European commission, not Westminster or Labour. Mr Mandelson is being vetted by MEPs as part of his appointment as the new EU trade commissioner.

  "At first glance the violence in Jabaliya in Palestine and in the Iraqi town of Samarra appear to be unconnected. The Israeli army's incursion into northern Gaza looks like just another deadeningly familiar episode in the unending conflict between Palestinians and Jews. <p>The US-led weekend assault on insurgents in mainly Sunni Samarra seems to be broadly typical of the continuing turmoil in Iraq.</p> <p>But peer beneath the headlines and it is clear that these ostensibly separate events are far from routine, and are closely linked in many ways, directly and indirectly.</p> <p>In both Jabaliya and Samarra modern armies with state-of-the-art weaponry and unanswerable air power attacked residential areas, causing numerous civilian casualties.</p> <p>In both cases the degree of lethal force used was grossly disproportionate to the assessed threat. Three US and two Iraqi battalions - about 5,000 men - were sent against 200-300 insurgents in Samarra.</p> <p>In Gaza, in order to deter the sort of vicious home-made Hamas rocket attacks that killed two children in Sderot last week, the Israelis have deployed an estimated 2,000 soldiers and 200 tanks, and are threatening an escalation.</p> <p>In both places, enormous damage has been done to homes and infrastructure, including basic services. The Palestinians are appealing for international assistance for what they say is a developing \"humanitarian tragedy\".</p> <p>The Iraqi Red Crescent, reporting that 500 families were forced to flee Samarra, said the Iraqi interim government had asked for emergency aid.</p> <p>Present horrors apart, Jabaliya and Samarra both offer disturbing portents, and both have considerable political significance.</p> <p>In Gaza, Israel seems intent on establishing a buffer zone on Palestinian land, the equivalent of the wall with which it is enclosing the West Bank and which, despite official denials, is prospectively just as permanent.</p> <p>This is linked in turn to the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon's controversial unilateral plan to evacuate most of the Gaza Strip next year while consolidating Israel's grip on growing swaths of the West Bank.</p> <p>The US attack on Samarra, a relatively easy target, appears to be a dress rehearsal for coming attempts to seize control of better defended insurgent strongholds such as Falluja, Sadr City and Ramadi.</p> <p>On the success of this campaign rests, to a large degree, the Bush administration's strategy for creating a democratic post-Saddam Iraq.</p> <p>And thus are the personal political fortunes of Mr Sharon and the US president, George Bush, bound up to a critical degree in what happens in places such as Jabaliya and Samarra.</p> <p>Both men are fighting to convince sceptical electorates, and their own parties, that they know what they are doing. When elected, Mr Sharon promised to achieve security for Israelis. Mr Bush declared victory in Iraq more than a year ago.</p> <p>Each man has a credibility gap. To fill it, it seems ongoing civilian carnage is not too high a price to pay.</p> <p>Jabaliya and Samarra may also be seen as linked symbols of a bigger problem. In Iraq and Palestine, two allied occupying powers - and democracies, at that - act with questionable or no legal authority and with evident impunity.</p> <p>Resolutions and protests from the UN are ignored. European and Arab governments wring their hands impotently. Tony Blair is reduced to hinting at better times to come. Yet the bald fact remains: the US and Israel behave they way they do because they can; there is simply nobody to stop them.</p> <p>And just as Israel's unbending stance, favouring force over dialogue, threatens a spreading conflict, drawing in Syria and Lebanon, so does an aggressive US policy, confusing power and legitimacy, intensify the risk of an Iraqi fragmentation embroiling Iran, Turkey and other neighbours.</p> <p>Jabaliya and Samarra, officially, are distinct theatres in the wider \"war on terror\".</p> <p>But far from being unconnected, to many in the Arab world they look dismayingly like integral parts of a western crusade against both Muslims and Islam in general, to which violent resistance is the only possible response.</p> <p>On both sides of the divide this dread downward spiral creates a kind of unseeing rage to which all are held hostage: blind in Iraq, eyeless in Gaza.</p>",
  "<p>The share price said it all: up a paltry 14p, or 5.3%, on the news. As far as the stock market is concerned, the Manchester United \"bid story\" is about as interesting as watching 22 men kick a piece of leather around a field. </p> <p>More specifically, there's no bid yet. What we've got is at least 22 corporate financiers from investment bankers JP Morgan; short of real work, they are running around trying to service a new client in the form of Malcolm Glazer. </p> <p>Shares in United should probably have fallen by 5% yesterday - in recognition of the one \"fact\" we can deduce from this sporting soap: the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers doesn't have the money to take the football club over. Let's run through what we know here. Some 18 months ago Glazer began to build his holding - refusing to speak to anyone about his intentions and thereby fuelling the rumour mill. </p> <p>After too many Glazer-to-bid stories to mention, last week saw the sudden resignation of Mehmet Dalman, Glazer's long-standing corporate finance adviser at Commerzbank, who is off to run his own asset management business. </p> <p>So the American stalker has moved his business to JP Morgan. Coincidentally, or otherwise, the Sunday newspapers immediately sprouted a fresh crop of stories saying the Buccaneers financier was going to bid, finally forcing a statement out of United. </p> <p>This confirmed a takeover approach, but stopped short of naming the putative buyer - adding, quite pointedly: \"This approach contains a number of significant conditions.\" </p> <p>Those conditions are said to add up to a request from Glazer that his new friends at JP Morgan put together a consortium of private equity funds who will invest alongside him. He'll take management control but with only a small increase on his existing 19% stake. Away from the harsh public gaze that comes with publicly quoted status, the new owners will then be free to apply a bit of structured finance to United's assets (think of the stadium, the licensing deals, television rights, ticket sales) and then run the team as though nothing has changed. </p> <p>However, with the club's share price already pumped high by all the bid speculation, the take-out price Glazer is talking about was being described as \"low ball\" yesterday by someone in a position to know. </p> <p>If there was genuine interest in a takeover by the private equity community we probably would have heard about it before now. It is difficult to see why such funds would want to get into a deal with Glazer, especially when the man is in his 70s. </p> <p>More to the point, there's absolutely no indication that the Irish concert party - made up of JP McManus and John Magnier, and who own a fraction under 30% - are remotely interested in selling. United must be about the most entertaining investment these boys have ever made. </p> <p><strong>Puerile spat</strong><br> </p> <p>A bizarre news release arrives from Euronext, the continental bourse group that includes the Liffe derivatives market in London. </p> <p>Citing the latest IPO Watch Europe survey from PricewaterhouseCoopers, tracking the number of company flotations, Euronext claims to be on a roll. </p> <p>\"According to this survey, Euronext's IPO raised a total of \u20ac1.7bn [\u00a31.2bn] during the third quarter,\" the statement declares. \"Two of the five biggest IPOs in Europe were on Euronext markets ... With 12 IPOs in total, the average offering value in the quarter was \u20ac141m for Euronext in contrast to London's \u20ac22m ... Altogether, 34 companies have joined Euronext since 1 January 2004.\" </p> <p>Hmm. Aside from the fact that Poopers' survey attributes 32 flotations to Euronext this year, that figure compares with 192 from the London Stock Exchange. </p> <p>It is certainly the case that Euronext's offerings this year have included some chunky issues, but this largely reflects the on-going process of privatisation in continental Europe, lumbering investors with companies such as Belgacom. It is also the case that during the April-June quarter, Euronext failed to shift as much new paper (by value) as Deutsche Borse and only narrowly beat Borsa Italiana. </p> <p>And this is from a consolidated exchange that takes in the bourses of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Portugal. The numbers, in context, suggest it is not doing very well at all. </p> <p>Of course, it is only fair to point out that London's totals are swollen by the extraordinary popularity of the Alternative Investment Market. Many of these new firms quoted here are shell companies, set up to take advantage of a regulatory loophole and often listed simply as tax-avoidance vehicles. </p> <p>It is not as if public quote status is suddenly a must-have corporate label. Quite the opposite - as yesterday's sale of Saga to a private equity-backed management team shows. </p> <p>Euronext and the LSE are locked in a cut-throat battle for business, where passions have been running high ever since the Liffe market snubbed the merger terms offered by Clara Furse at the LSE four years ago, choosing Euronext instead. </p> <p>It's a juvenile spat, played out through silly claims such as the one above. It is about time both sides grew up.</p>",
  "Israeli forces have demolished the homes of hundreds of Palestinians, bulldozed swaths of agricultural land and destroyed infrastructure in their bloodiest assault on the Gaza Strip in years. <p>More than 70 people have died in Operation Days of Penitence, launched in northern Gaza six days ago after a Hamas rocket attack killed two Israeli children. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said that the dead included 31 civilians. Nineteen were under 18. </p> <p>Most of the nine people killed yesterday were Palestinian fighters, but a teenage girl was among the dead, shot in her home. In southern Gaza Israeli forces killed a four-year-old boy in Khan Yunis refugee camp, where several Palestinian children have been shot dead in recent weeks. </p> <p>Last night the Israeli army said it had killed a Palestinian gunman who had tried to infiltrate a nearby settlement. Early today an Israeli missile strike in Jabaliya killed one Palestinian militant and wounded two others. </p> <p>But shielded from view is the suffering of about 50,000 Palestinians trapped in areas seized by hundreds of Israeli troops, backed by about 200 tanks and armoured vehicles. </p> <p>Palestinians in the Israeli-held areas, including parts of Jabaliya refugee camp and the small town of Beit Hanoun, described by telephone the widespread destruction and desperate living conditions. </p> <p>Armoured bulldozers had demolished scores, possibly hundreds, of homes, they said. Thousands of people had spent days without electricity and water, although power was restored sporadically yesterday. Residents said that the destruction of sewage systems had contaminated the water supplies in some areas. </p> <p>\"I can hear shooting now,\" said Hanna Basyouni, 35, who has seven children, speaking from an occupied section of Jabaliya. \"I see the tanks below me. The tanks and the bulldozers are 50 metres away from my home. I can see them shooting right now.\" </p> <p>Mrs Basyouni lives on the edge of Jabaliya where, she said, the Israeli army had bulldozed greenhouses that had been families' only source of income for several generations. </p> <p>The Israeli military says it is clearing a six-mile-wide buffer zone to stop Hamas launching rockets across the border. But yesterday the Islamist group fired two missiles into Israel. \"There's not one tree left for as far as I can see,\" said Mrs Basyouni. \"Five or six homes around me are completely bulldozed, and I can't be sure how many beyond that. My sister's home was destroyed ... [She] is living in a tent. She has nine children.\" </p> <p>Ambulance drivers, the only Palestinians permitted to cross into the occupied areas, confirmed the scale of the destruction. Abid Ahmed Abu Mohammed, a driver for Kamal Odwan hospital, said: \"We saw at least 50 houses bulldozed on the edge of Jabaliya and many inside the camp. </p> <p>\"I think most of the bulldozing was to make way for the tanks. There are main roads but the Israelis were afraid to use them because of mines. The bulldozers ... destroyed whatever was in their way - entire streets.\" </p> <p>The Israeli army said it had destroyed or damaged a \"small number\" of homes, either because its soldiers had been attacked or to allow its tanks to avoid booby-trapped roads. </p> <p>Many people are without water in Beit Hanoun, a town of 15,000 near the border with Israel. Aref Azaneed, a ministry of agriculture inspector, said: \"The water and the sewage lines are near each other. When the tanks destroy them, they mix. The water from the tap has sewage in it.\" </p> <p>Over the past three years the army has levelled 60% of Beit Hanoun's agricultural land, destroying its wealth and the main source of citrus fruit and olives in the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>\"Nobody comes in, nobody goes out,\" Mr Azaneed said. \"We can only move inside Beit Hanoun, and in a very careful way. There are about 40 tanks about 30 metres from houses close to Salahadin Road.\" </p> <p>A UN official said yesterday Israel had wrongly accused Hamas militants of using a UN ambulance to carry rockets, while Israeli officials renewed accusations that Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, was harbouring terrorists, the Associated Press reported. </p> <p>Israel has demanded the UN investigate the actions of Peter Hansen, its top official in Gaza, after its army released video footage from an unmanned aircraft that reportedly showed militants loading a rocket into a UN vehicle in Gaza. </p> <p>The UN says the footage shows a worker loading a stretcher into the vehicle. On Monday Mr Hansen wrote to the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, accusing Israel of inventing the story.</p>",

  "If, say, barristers come from Britain's ethnic minorities, I have described them as \"ethnic minority barristers\", and no one has ever taken offence at this. I'm now being told, increasingly, that I should be saying \"minority ethnic\" barristers. It is grammatically and logically wrong and doesn't make sense, but, in spite of my denunciations, the practice has spread and become official in many quarters. <p>No one has yet been able to explain to me why this incorrect usage should prevail. I've now seen the latest version of the Law Society's Equality and Diversity Handbook. This is what appears: \"Minority Ethnic Communities - perfectly acceptable to use to describe all minority ethnic communities. The term minority ethnic makes it clearer that it is not just minorities who have an ethnic identity but also the majority. The emphasis is on the minority status rather than the ethnicity.\" [This is unmitigated nonsense. But it doesn't stop there.] \"Black and Minority Ethnic Groups - Currently, this is probably the most widely used term used when referring to all minority groups in England and Wales.\" [Prepare yourself for the next bit.] \"It is seen as all-embracing and inclusive, it recognises the fact that we all have ethnicity and that it is the minority status which is being emphasised. It includes white minority groups and it acknowledges (by the use of the term black) that visible minorities share experiences because of the colour of their skins which white minorities do not. You may sometimes see this shortened to BME Groups.\" A load of tosh, which I haven't the energy or the spirit to demolish. </p> <p>Just one point among the 47 I could make. Should it not then be BOME? Black and Other Minority Ethnic groups? Otherwise it could be read that blacks are not among \"minority ethnic\" groups, and so on. But be honest. Have you the faintest idea what's going on? </p> <p>While I'm in this rampaging mood, let me draw attention to the increasing - and, of course, wrong - use of the term \"law firm\" or \"firm\" to describe a barristers' chambers. It even appeared on Sunday in the column of a well-known Observer writer. These days, the mistake is usually made when referring to Matrix Chambers as \"Cherie Booth's law firm.\" </p> <p>A firm is a partnership, a recognised legal entity involving a host of duties and obligations. Partnerships between solicitors are firms. The partners in the firm share its income (and losses) in whatever proportion they've agreed. Barristers, in contrast, are independent service providers who choose to get together in order to share administrative services and costs. Their chambers - the sets of rooms they cluster in - may have developed their own specialities and identities, like Matrix has, but the legal status of barristers hasn't changed. They operate as individuals. There is no partnership, there is no sharing of income, there is no firm and no company. </p> <p>To some extent, I blame the chambers themselves for the confusion. It's only in the past few years that chambers have started marketing themselves as such, boasting about the calibre of their members and the cases they've won, and any prime ministers' wives they may have on board. It is no wonder then that the public starts thinking of Matrix (or Cloisters, Blackstone or Doughty Street) as some kind of entity, a firm for want of another word. The media ought to know better. </p> <p>There is something satisfying in being able to complete my column with yet another fussy reaction to a word. This time, I'm not so much complaining as bewildered. First, the warning. A new word is about to become fashionable in legal and relationship-breakdown circles. The word is \"collaborative\". </p> <p>Practise it. You'll soon be required to bandy it about at dinner parties as if you knew what it meant. Here's a clue. It's usually used in the phrase \"Collaborative Family Law\". And you won't be surprised to be told that it's a North American invention which is - yes, you've got it - coming to Britain. OK, but what is it? </p> <p>\"Collaborative family law is a new option for divorcing and separating couples to resolve family law issues by negotiation without going to court,\" the press release tells me. \" Agreeing to work together in this way can help clients feel more in control of the process.\" This is obviously very different from the old-fashioned, so yesterday, method of couples resolving family law issues by negotiation, and agreeing to work together, but - how behind the times can you be? - without using the word collaborative. Still, there are now 150 trained collaborative family lawyers around, so that's a consolation.</p>",

  "Iraq's cycle of violence claimed at least another 26 lives yesterday when three car bombs detonated in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul. <p>In Falluja the US military launched two air strikes against what it said were suspected hideouts of the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Doctors in the town said 11 people were killed, including some civilians, with children among them. </p> <p>Operations continued in Samarra, north of Baghdad, where US troops mounted a major offensive last week to take back control of the city. Abdul-Nasser Hamed Yassin, an official at the city's hospital, said 70 dead had been brought in since the fighting started, among them 23 children. At least 160 wounded were treated. Many residents carried their dead to the graveyard yesterday, waving white flags on sticks as they walked through deserted streets. </p> <p>Late last night, US warplanes attacked Sadr City in Baghdad, as fighting broke out between American troops and rebels. </p> <p>Yesterday morning, the blast from the first car bomb shook Baghdad shortly before 9am as a large crowd of recruits for the police force and a new special forces unit were queuing at an entrance to the heavily fortified green zone. </p> <p>A car raced up to the gate and blew up, killing 15 people in the crowd and injuring at least 80. \"Other cars around began to explode one after another,\" said Ziyad Ghali, 33, who was standing near by. </p> <p>Residents had blocked off their street to traffic. \"We were expecting something like this would happen,\" Mr Ghali said. \"They should not ask these recruits to come here.\" </p> <p>Like many wealthier Iraqis, Mr Ghali is leaving the coun try and going to the US. \"The situation turns worse by the day,\" he said. </p> <p>At the Yarmuk hospital, the corridors were crowded with trolleys bearing dozens of injured. Among them stood Jamil Abdul Zara, 35, his right hand in plaster and much of his face burnt from the blast. He had come from Diwaniya, a province north of the capital, to apply for a job as a policeman. </p> <p>\"I saw so many people dead around me,\" he said. \"The police started shooting in the air and then the ambulances brought us to hospital. I came because there is no other work, but I will not queue to be a recruit again. That's enough.\" </p> <p>Many of the injured said that the blast had come not from a car bomb but an American missile - a claim commonly made, and a sign of deep frustration at the occupation. </p> <p>\"I have no job. I am married, I have children. I am not a looter or a kidnapper,\" said Assi Anan, 28, who was queuing to join the special forces unit and was unhurt. \"They told me I would get 450,000 dinars [\u00a3180], so I came.\" </p> <p>An hour after the first blast, a truck bomb exploded in Saddoun Street, targeting a convoy leaving a hotel where contractors are staying. At least six people were killed, and a dozen wounded. </p> <p>Another car bomb exploded outside a primary school in Mosul. The US military said it appeared to have detonated before it reached its target. Five people, including two children, were killed and 11 people were injured. </p> <p>In Baghdad, gunmen killed Thamir Abdul-Latif, a senior official in Iraq's science and technology ministry, as he drove to work; and in Balad Ruz, north of Baghdad, the police chief was shot dead.</p>",
  "<p>Ian Tregarthen Jenkin, who has died aged 84, had a highly successful career in art education, and went on after retirement to yet more success as founding director of the Open College of the Arts (OCA). </p> <p>His father was the first director of education and welfare for prisons, and his mother a keen musician. He was brought up in Malvern, Worcestershire, where his parents were much involved in the Malvern festival, and where he became a great lover of the outdoor life. He went on an art scholarship to Stowe school and, at 17, had a self-portrait included in a London exhibition. </p> <p>After a brief period at Camberwell School of Art and Crafts, Jenkin went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where, in studies interrupted by the second world war, he took an economics degree. During the war, he served as a Royal Artillery battery commander in coastal defence in England and Jamaica. </p> <p>Thereafter, he went to the Slade School of Art as tutor and secretary, having overall responsibility both for pastoral care and administration. His time there, from 1949 to 1975, coincided with that of Professor William Coldstream, a close friend. In 1968, he steered through the creation of a staff/student committee, thus ensuring that the Slade did not succumb to student unrest. </p> <p>Jenkin moved on to become principal of Camberwell, a post he held with distinction, creating student accommodation and setting up the Camberwell Residential Academic Fellowship Trust Fund to provide financial support for young artists. He financed this through a huge raffle of work given by his friends. </p> <p>When it was mooted that Camberwell should become a specialist graphics and crafts college, within the new London Institute, he fought successfully to retain the school's overall diversity. One former colleague described him as \"Camberwell personified\". </p> <p>On his retirement in 1985, Jenkin became curator of the Royal Academy schools. He had only been there a year, however, when Michael Young (Lord Young of Dartington, obituary, January 16 2002), then working on the idea of distance learning in the arts, met him, and noted that he was \"keener on the concept than anyone I'd met so far ... had had many common-room discussions about a really good correspondence course in painting ... the ideal person to lead this venture\". </p> <p>Thus it was that for the next three years Jenkin became director of OCA, working on a shoestring and launching the first courses to great success within 15 months of taking control. For a further seven years, he served OCA as a regional organiser. </p> <p>Jenkin was a totally dedicated public figure, serving as a trustee, governor, member or adviser on a large array of arts organisations - he was particularly interested in making art available in prisons and hospitals. </p> <p>He was also an utterly charming man. During his time at the Slade, he was surrounded by distinguished artists, but described himself as a \"failed painter\". He acquired an excellent collection of paintings from colleagues and students, and generously shared them with his friends, without the slightest thought of their being a valuable investment. </p> <p>On their birthdays, Camberwell students would receive cards from Jenkin, handed over in person in the principal's office whenever possible. As a result of his strong interest in his students' lives, he had a wide circle of former students with a real affection for him - a most valuable asset when he was looking for tutors to support OCA courses. </p> <p>Jenkin inherited a farmhouse and smallholding near Maidenhead, Berkshire; at the same time as running an art college, he kept cattle and chickens. He would be up very early collecting eggs, which he would take into London, a feather in each box, selling to people on the train and to college staff. </p> <p>He never married, but was devoted to his two sisters and to his nephew and niece and their children. He also loved hearing about the lives of colleagues' and friends' children, to whom he would send delightful picture-puzzle letters.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ian Evers Tregarthen Jenkin, art educator, born June 18 1920; died September 5 2004</p>",
  "The Conservative party is middle England, David Willetts once wrote. It has no need of focus groups to tell it what middle England is thinking. It merely needs to know what its own members and their families are thinking. <p>They were brave words in 1997, when Willetts wrote them. Today, with the party sinking slowly into the upper 20s in the latest poll, they merely seem sad. The Tory party at Bournemouth is like a once-great champion golfer who can't understand why he keeps shooting over 80. The conference is taking place behind a ring of security suggesting a party of government, but who, other than Robert Kilroy-Silk, wants to kill anyone in this party any longer? </p> <p>One question dominates - how can the Tories win again? - but it is in the nature of a party conference that such a question can never be asked in the hall. Officially, the conference is preparing for government. \"Welcome to Bournemouth, to this, our last conference in opposition,\" the party co-chairman Liam Fox began his speech yesterday. But he didn't believe it either. It was like being in the Crystal Palace dressing room before a match against Arsenal. </p> <p>\"How can the Tories win again?\" is nevertheless the question on most lips. Many fringe meetings are explicitly or implicitly trying to find an answer. David Cameron, rising hope of the soft, pragmatic Tories, had a try in a single-sentence response at a lunchtime event yesterday: \"By emphasising the Conservative values that the vast majority of the British public share, by turning them into Conservative policies - and by showing how we would put them in to action.\" </p> <p>That wasn't a bad try. But it was pretty much also what Willetts was saying in 1997 - and Tory fortunes have slumped in the intervening years. The party is unfocused. It is too fussed about the wrong things - Gibraltar, hunting and death duties. </p> <p>For a snapshot of what's wrong, you needed to listen to Fox yesterday. Of all the problems facing the country and the Tory party, political correctness comes way down the league. Yet Fox used his keynote speech to complain at length about police use of the term \"group rape\" rather than \"gang rape\". It was like being trapped against a saloon bar by a man in a sheepskin coat who has had a couple of gins too many. </p> <p>But that's just a snapshot. If you want to not just understand the Tories' current problems but also place them within the big political picture, then arm yourself with a copy of the YouGov/Daily Telegraph opinion poll of September 27 (a less detailed version also appears in the current issue of the Economist). If there has been a more informative poll finding in recent times, then I do not recall it. </p> <p>The YouGov pollsters asked respondents to give themselves a score along a left-right axis. If their answer was exactly in the centre, their score was nought. If they were extreme left, it was minus 100; extreme right was plus 100. </p> <p>The replies generated a gentle bell curve, with most people situating themselves somewhere in the centre, and those on the left more likely to be centrists, while those on the right were more likely to be extreme. The average British voter, the survey found, was marginally to the left of centre, at minus 2. </p> <p>Then YouGov asked the voters to give the three main party leaders, their MPs, Gordon Brown and Kenneth Clarke places on the same scale. They put Tony Blair just to the right of centre (+4). Charles Kennedy and his Liberal Democrat MPs were placed to the left (-15). Brown was placed further left still (-22), just behind Labour MPs (-25). To the right of the mean, Clarke was placed at plus 24. But the voters thought Michael Howard, along with Tory MPs as a whole, was much further to the right, at plus 52. </p> <p>These findings are not revolutionary. But they underscore with rare clarity some central realities about modern British politics. Blair, in spite of all the things he has done wrong and all the mistrust in which he is held, is still - by some distance -the party leader most in touch with most people. Brown is perceived to be significantly further to the left, well away from the mean and much closer to Labour MPs, but significantly further from the mass of voters in the centre than Kennedy, never mind Blair. The implicit difficulties Brown would face as Labour leader in attracting middle-ground voters are striking. </p> <p>But it is Howard's position in this spectrum that is the most truly dreadful right now, especially for a man seeking to be prime minister. The voters see the Tories as the most extreme of all the parties. While Blair is a mere six points from the average, Howard is no fewer than 54 away. While Blair is clearly perceived to be more moderate than his party, Howard is labelled as just as extreme as his troops. However you cut it, any Tory who currently claims that he or she speaks for middle England (or middle anywhere) is simply deceiving themselves. </p> <p>Intelligent Tories know they cannot continue this way. Cameron yesterday pointed to some of the things they have to do to begin to get closer to the middle ground: avoid creating artificial differences with Labour; avoid monomania on Europe or anything else; concentrate on shared values; be prepared to modernise; and always acknowledge in policy \"that there is a 'we' as well as a 'me'\". </p> <p>But there is a gulf between knowing roughly what to do and having a serious opportunity to do it. Talking to the modernising Tories in Bournemouth this week carries many echoes of conversations in Bournemouth two weeks ago with the modernising Orange Book group of Liberal Democrats. In both parties there is a recognition, confirmed by the YouGov poll, that while Blair remains at the head of the Labour party the other parties' electoral chances are much narrower. </p> <p>This barrier existed before the European elections and the Hartlepool byelection. But Ukip's successes make it exceptionally hard for Tories who want to march towards the centre. If Ukip were to poll 5% in every constituency in the general election, several Tory MPs would face a murderous squeeze. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said yesterday that between 30 and 50 Tories could be at risk. Seats like Taunton, Isle of Wight and Davis's own Haltemprice and Howden look harder than ever to defend. </p> <p>This is one dimension of how the 2005 election may now be far more volatile and unpredictable at constituency level than the national polls can imply. The combination of Labour's broad but hollow support and the Tories' narrow but hollow equivalent will benefit not just the Liberal Democrats but Ukip and, in one or two places, the Greens. The big parliamentary story will continue to be told in the familiar two- or three-party terms. But in many constituencies, this could be a four-or even a five-party contest. From Cornwall to Cumberland, middle England has rarely been more up for grabs. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Like twin rivers in spate, several thousand people flow down parallel pavements the length of Munich's vast conference halls. Here and there, a signboard held by a rep bobs above the flow. They are heading for the car park, where dozens of buses hired by drug companies are waiting to take them to dinner. These are not package tourists, but doctors. <p>This is the main annual European conference for cardiologists - a huge affair of 18,000 delegates. Most travel there courtesy of the drug companies. They have their registration paid, their flight paid, their hotel paid and their meals paid. Out of courtesy, they attend the \"satellite symposium\" before dinner promoting their sponsor's drug. </p> <p>Many senior doctors or \"opinion leaders\" hired to speak on behalf of the drug companies at these events will sleep in the best hotels and collect between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000 for their talk, if they are not already on an annual retainer of \u00a310-20,000 from each company they advise. </p> <p>Most doctors say the sponsorship of doctors by the drug companies is normal, inevitable in a capitalist society, and does no harm because, they insist, they are not influenced. Others say it is shocking. Raymond MacAllister, senior lecturer in pharmacology at University College London, believes the profession is under a mass delusion. \"If the general public knew what was going on, they would be astonished,\" he said. </p> <p>Edwin Gale, a professor of diabetes at Bristol University's division of medicine, once took drug industry money but changed his mind after he was asked to investigate a class of drug by a colleague who wanted somebody \"who is not in the pocket of the companies\". He was shocked to discover that the drugs had been kept on the market in the US for three years after it became clear that people were dying of liver failure. </p> <p>In an article he was asked to write for Clinical Medicine, the journal of the Royal College of Physicians, last November, he analysed the science that shades into marketing, the professors who end up as promoters, and called on each doctor to make a moral decision about their own involvement. Most do not recognise what is happening, he said. \"Doctors are so incredibly gullible because they suspect themselves of the very highest motives.\" </p> <p>The article brought him support even from some scientists in the employ of industry, he said. \"They said they are sickened by the process they are involved in. One said I just wondered when doctors were going to wake up to what is going on.\" </p> <p>There are rules on gifts to doctors - nothing much more than a pen or a coffee mug is allowed. So in the Munich exhibition halls, vast as aircraft hangars, the big companies run quizzes at their space-age stands. Doctors sit on stools at a table, fingers on buzzers, or crowd round the posters filling in questionnaires about the company drugs. It is every one a winner and they walk off with a digital camera, a calculator or silver computer mouse. Many doctors wander the stands with bags crammed with booty. </p> <p>Sponsorship is part of the NHS fabric. Every doctor must keep up to date with about 50 hours of continuing medical education a year. Five days in Munich listening to the scientific presentations at the European Society of Cardiology meeting nets a doctor 18 hours of credits. But the NHS has a limited pot of money, so in fields like cardiology, psychiatry and rheumatology where drugs are big business, the companies step in. </p> <p>Everything is paid for. The Munich hotels had drug company desks in the foyers, with schedules of dinners and the industry's satellite symposia times on the noticeboards and buses that drew up outside after breakfast and dropped doctors back after dinner. </p> <p>In the company sights, says a cardiologist who attended the Munich conference but does not want to be named, is the hospital formulary. This is the list of drugs, drawn up by a committee, that the hospital consultants can prescribe for their patients, who then get the prescription continued by the GP. </p> <p>\"There is overt pressure,\" he said. \"the local hospital drug reps come to us and say - will you make an application to the formulary committee? You have to be able to argue back to them.\" Those doctors who refuse to help will be out of favour come conference time, he said. He did once make an application to the formulary committee because he was impressed by a certain heart drug. It was accepted. As far as the drug company was concerned, he \"was the cat's pyjamas. The year after they took me to America for a conference. I was comfortable with what I had done, but you can see how easily that becomes a trap to fall into,\" he said. </p> <p>A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2000 showed that the more free meals a doctor has from a drug company, the more often he is likely to ask for their drug to be put on the approved list. Also associated with such requests is meeting drug reps, accepting funding to travel to conferences and accepting research funds. </p> <p>Dr MacAllister says the formulary committee he sits on in his large teaching hospital is robust. \"But in a district general hospital, they are more likely to say - he's the heart specialist - let him have it.\" </p> <p>There is still more concern about the independence of senior doctors, often involved in drug trials for the industry, who are recruited by the companies as consultants and can earn considerable amounts of money speaking to conferences about new drugs and giving companies advice on marketing their products. In the trade, such an authoritative academic is known as a \"silvertop\". </p> <p>Professor Gale had a consultancy around six or seven years ago: \"I was earning about \u00a325,000 a year (extra), of which \u00a320,000 was formally a consultancy fee. </p> <p>\"I know people who have been offered \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000 a year to sit on advisory committees,\" said Dr MacAllister. A colleague was paid \u00a3800 by a company when a talk he was to give was cancelled. Robin Murray, professor at the Institute of Psychiatry, who said he could be offered $2,000 for a talk which he would put into his research fund, said the issue was not with the drug companies, but with the clinicians. \"You don't necessarily expect your colleagues to speak in support of whatever drug they are being paid to support. It is very dismaying to find academic psychiatrists that one has hitherto respected supporting one drug on a Monday and another on Tuesday,\" he said. </p> <p>Increasingly, he said, academics are putting their names to drug trial research papers which are \"ghost-written\" by company employees. \"Academics, particularly academic pharmacologists, have somehow begun to believe that it is acceptable to present company data as if they were a hired gun,\" he said. </p> <p>If the audience knew those academics had not taken part in the collection of the trial data, he said, \"they would be much less impressed.\" But the doctors who advise companies and carry out research say the concern is misplaced. </p> <p>Philip Poole-Wilson, professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute of Imperial College, London, who was the lead author in a trial of Bayer's drug nifedipine and spoke at their satellite symposium in Munich, said it was up to individuals to obey their consciences. </p> <p>\"I'm not going to be manipulated by any company, by any amount of people or anybody. I'm going to say what I want to say and that's that. I regard myself rather like a barrister - that I'm a cardiologist, I know the subject, I'm prepared to speak on it when invited and if I am invited I expect to be paid.\" </p> <p>John Betteridge, professor of endocrinology and metabolism at University College London, who also spoke in Munich and has declared interests in seven pharmaceutical companies as an expert adviser to the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, maintained that doctors were independent of drug company influence. \"I think it would be very unusual if doctors used drugs if they thought they weren't the best for that particular patient,\" he said. </p> <p>Nonetheless, a paper produced by the Pharmaceutical Marketing journal suggests \"opinion leaders\" are carefully recruited and groomed. </p> <p>It urges \"careful identification of the people you should be working with. The key is to evaluate their views and influence potential, to recruit them to specially designed relationship-building activities and then provide them with a programme of appropriate communications platforms.\" </p> <p>Joe Collier, professor of medicines policy at St George's school of medicine in London, said: \"Here is an industry that abuses its power to manipulate what is being prescribed. The cynicism ... seems to know no bounds.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rather as the Inuit are said to have 80 different words for snow, so the British have that many, and more, to describe getting drunk. Plastered, wrecked, trolleyed, pissed, and arseholed are but a few of the coinages that - prefixed by \"completely\", \"totally\" or, if especially bladdered, \"absolutely\" - speak with a proud sense of achievement of the advanced stages of inebriation. For just as snow forms the limit of the Inuit's horizon so, it appears, does drunkenness saturate the fabric of British life. </p> <p>No sooner does a new adjective enter the lexicon of larging-it than it is replaced by a more extreme synonym. It's as if the condition of drunkenness for which we are striving lies beyond language - as indeed it often proves - and no word can hope to encapsulate the comprehensive dysfunction that is the proper result of \"a good session\". </p> <p>Sometimes, especially on Fridays and Saturdays, it can seem that sobriety is our national enemy, an implacable foe that needs to be fought on all fronts at all times, or at least until the pubs close. Such is our determination to crush the forces of temperance that we have taken the battle abroad to far-flung outposts such as Amsterdam, Prague and Budapest. </p> <p>Nowadays, in the streets of capitals across mainland Europe, you can find young Britons emptying both their bladders and stomachs. They say that the youth of today lack beliefs, but these are men and women who are fully committed to the cause of alcoholic annihilation. They will simply not rest until they have relinquished all control of their motor skills. </p> <p>On the domestic front, the effort is no less focused. Yesterday, Alan Woods, a senior tourism executive, told a council meeting in Blackpool that British resorts looked like \"war zones, rife with rubbish and soaked with sick and urine\". Yes, I imagine his audience nodding with complacent recognition, that sounds like home. </p> <p>Woods argued that the recent trend for stag and hen nights was to blame for this social decay. It would be nice for ironic purposes to single out the traditional institution of marriage as the cause of the much-discussed blight of binge drinking (haven't there always been stag nights - or are young people getting married more often now?) But there are so many suspects, from a greedy and unscrupulous drinks industry to clueless local authorities, that it would not serve the interests of justice to single out one culprit. </p> <p>Whoever you want to accuse - including a hysterical media that both celebrates and demonises drunkenness - the inescapable fact remains that the British, by and large, like to get drunk more than they like drinking. That is to say, we take a utilitarian approach to alcohol: what's the point of consuming it unless we end up rat-arsed? </p> <p>Just a few days ago my wife returned from Milan complaining about Celtic football supporters she saw boozed-up in the city's elegant piazzas. A few seconds after she finished this tirade, she went on to moan about the miserably small amounts of wine she had been poured at some function she had attended. Then, having expressed my sympathy on both counts, I went out and got drunk. </p> <p>As I asked myself the morning afterwards, and not for the first time: why do we do it? Why do we have that fifth glass or, in some cases, that 15th pint? In a vain effort to answer that question I recently visited Nottingham, said to be the home of binge-drinking, and its twin town of Ghent in Belgium. Both cities are around the same size (250,000), both have a history of lacemaking, and both feature historic centres with lots of bars. </p> <p>In Ghent, the police told me, they dealt with a violent incident on average once every fortnight. In Nottingham, I couldn't get close to the police to ask them: they were too busy breaking up fights and arresting people. In Ghent, some of the bars remained opened until 8am in the morning and you could buy beer in McDonald's. In Nottingham, there were teams of bouncers on every bar and at chucking-out time (11pm or midnight for bars, 2am for clubs), gangs of intimidating young men roamed streets that were devoid of public transport and conveniences. </p> <p>I met drunk people in Ghent, Belgians on stag nights dressed as deep-sea divers, but they were not looking for anything else. They were contented drunks. In Nottingham, they were all looking for something more, be it another drink, a bus, a taxi, somewhere to relieve themselves or a fight. </p> <p>Next summer, bars will be able to apply for 24-hour drinking licences, and in the run-up there has been a spate of scare stories suggesting that the new legislation will lead to 24-hour binge drinking. Stephen Green, the chief constable of Nottingham, is just one of many experts in the field who are on record as saying that it will lead to greater crime. </p> <p>In response, Richard Caborn, the minister for sport and tourism, has had to issue tough statements promising that he will not stand for misbehaviour. I'm not sure if it says more about the government's attitude to our drinking culture or its true feeling for sport that the same minister is responsible for both. Nevertheless, I have some sympathy for Caborn. </p> <p>Essentially, he is attempting to make us both more free and more responsible, which has to be good thing. For generations, and by successive governments, British people have not been trusted with a drink after the hour of 11pm. In the process, the nation's youth, to say nothing of its more mature citizens, have grown up under an effective curfew and a semi-prohibition. In these rushed and draconian circumstances, it's no wonder that we have developed an unhealthy relationship with booze. </p> <p>There seems little doubt, either, that things will get worse before they get better. The British might never learn to savour the small quantities of wine that so disappointed my wife in Italy, but we should discover that drunkenness is a less appropriate response to freedom than it is to restriction. </p> <p>Of course, that will take time. In the interim, it might help if our towns and cities began to catch up with modern life. Fourteen years ago, Nottingham Safer Cities Project published a report to combat alcohol-related crime. It set out to reclaim the city centre for non-drinkers, or at least non-drunks, and recommended that transport, museums, galleries, cinemas, sporting facilities and bookshops should be encouraged to open later. A few weeks ago I saw about 100 bars and three restaurants, and nothing else that was functioning after dark in the heart of Nottingham. The local council told me that it had no plans to extend the tram's working hours or even to build a public lavatory. </p> <p>In other words, the intention, and one that extends way beyond Nottingham, is to treat late-night city-centre visitors like unsocial drunks and just hope that they don't behave that way. And if they do, well, that must be a problem for the police. Really, it's enough to turn you to drink.</p>",
  "Government powers to detain foreigners indefinitely under anti-terror laws violate international law and threaten the very values they were designed to protect, a QC representing seven detainees told a special panel of nine law lords yesterday. <p>Convened for only the second time since the first world war, the nine-judge panel is hearing one of the most important human rights cases to come before Britain's highest court, the House of Lords. </p> <p>Nine men held without charge or trial for almost three years under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, passed after the September 11 atrocities in the US, are seeking to overturn a court of appeal ruling which backed the home secretary's powers to detain them indefinitely on suspicion of terrorism. </p> <p>The government, which is fighting to retain what it sees as a key plank in the battle against terrorism, is fielding a heavyweight team of six barristers, including three QCs, led by the attorney general Lord Goldsmith. </p> <p>Ben Emmerson QC, opening the case for seven detainees, said: \"Despite the complexity of some submissions in this case, the ultimate issue is really very straightforward. We say in a democracy it is unacceptable to lock up potentially innocent people without trial or without any indication when, if ever, they are going to be released. </p> <p>\"We say it is doubly unac ceptable for a democracy committed to the principles of equality and anti-discrimination to single out foreign nationals when it is not prepared to apply the same measures to its own nationals.\" </p> <p>The judges flanked the senior law lord, Lord Bingham, in the Moses room in the House of Lords, overlooked by murals of Old Testament scenes. </p> <p>Mr Emmerson said no one could doubt the September 11 terrorist attacks were a direct assault on the values of democracy. They represented a new brand of terrorism - highlighted by ruthlessness and disregard of human rights. </p> <p>They were etched on the world's consciousness not just because they were perpetrated against the world's most powerful nation but because of the massive loss of human life. </p> <p>\"There is an inevitable temptation for parliaments and governments to fight fire with fire and set aside legal safeguards which exist within a democratic state,\" he added. \"We can fall into the trap which terrorism sets for democracy and the rule of law by destroying those values.\" </p> <p>Mr Emmerson said the fundamental issue was whether the government could lawfully detain a criminal suspect without charge indefinitely. </p> <p>He said that by derogating from - opting out of - obligations under the European convention on human rights to allow indefinite detention of foreign nationals on suspicion alone, the government had \"wrongly adopted and permitted measures fundamentally inconsistent with the core values of democracy and justice\". To pass the anti-terror law, the government had to opt out of article five of the convention, the right to liberty. An opt-out is allowed by the convention only in cases of \"public emergency threatening the life of the nation.\" </p> <p>Mr Emmerson said the men he was representing had been in custody for nearly three years with no idea when, if ever, they would be released, and had never been formally interviewed, and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. The justification for this, he said, was the continuing threat from terrorism, according to the government. </p> <p>But this threat was likely to continue indefinitely, and David Blunkett, home secretary, had misconstrued the meaning of the expression \"public emergency\". The measures were not now strictly required by the situation, were disproportionate, and contravened Britain's obligations under international law. </p> <p>A derogation should be strictly limited to what was necessary and other measures, such as \"electronic house arrest\" could be used. </p> <p>Mr Emmerson said the treatment of foreign nationals was discriminatory and therefore violated the human rights convention because a significant number of al-Qaida adherents were British nationals, who could not be dealt with under these measures. He told the judges Mr Blunkett was justifying the law by saying he was dealing with an international terrorist organisation which might strike at any time. </p> <p>\"But to move from that to say there is a threat and take the exceptional step of suspending human rights obligations is a very, very substantial step indeed,\" he said. No other country bound by the human rights convention had opted out of article five, including Spain, which had experienced a terrorist attack. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith is expected to argue tomorrow for the government that the 2001 attacks were an \"unprecedented form of terrorism\" - a new phase in an \"ideological war by Islamist extremists\" - which demanded a robust response from the government.</p>",
  "After their fourth-place debacle behind Ukip in Hartlepool, the Tories gather in Bournemouth more hopeless than ever. Tony Blair is disliked by his own party and distrusted by the electorate, and still the Tories can't lay a glove on him politically. Their misery is matched by the anger of millions on the left, appalled by what Blair has done, and yet unable to get rid of him. Many of them persuade themselves that, bad as Blair is, the Tories would be worse, not least in terms of servile subjection to the US. <p>But need that be true? Not only is the Iraq war deeply unpopular with ordinary Tories across the country, as many MPs privately admit, unquestioning obedience to US orders is far from a Tory tradition. Over the years the Tories have often had a better record than Labour of detachment from Washington. </p> <p>Any Tory illusions about America really should not have survived the Suez episode. In 1956, Britain, France and Israel went to war on false pretences to destroy a troublesome Arab dictator (does that have a familiar ring?) before the Eisenhower administration ruthlessly pulled the rug from under the British and the French. Washington showed that any idea of a \"special relationship\" was thoroughly one-sided. </p> <p>Later relations between the Tories and America were often more tense than transatlantic rhetoric suggested. Although Harold Wilson adroitly avoided committing British troops to Vietnam, he annoyed the Labour party by giving his tepid verbal endorsement to the war. </p> <p>But one wonders how many people remember that in 1966 the Tories were told emphatically that this country should keep out of Vietnam war, by the shadow defence minister at the time, Enoch Powell. He was anything but reflexively pro-American, and it's a pity that his healthy scepticism about the US is the one thing his acolytes have forgotten. </p> <p>Between 1970 and 1974, Edward Heath tried to turn his party and country away from America toward Europe. But much more fascinating was his successor, Margaret Thatcher. She was decidedly less a supporter of \"America right or wrong\" than is often supposed, and had several eye-opening experiences. </p> <p>After the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands, US assistance for its British ally was far from instant or open-handed. There was already a neo-conservative cabal in Washington, keener to keep on terms with useful Latin American dictators than with London. When the US did offer London some help, it was against the wishes of Jeane Kirkpatrick, Washington's ambassador to the UN. </p> <p>In 1983, Thatcher was incensed when the US invaded Grenada to suppress a leftwing coup, and London was not even informed in advance about this assault on a former British colony. </p> <p>She did allow the Americans to use air bases in England for a punitive raid on Libya in 1986. Yet, apart from the Foreign Office and the 70% of the British people who opposed the action, it was strongly criticised inside her cabinet by Norman Tebbit, Nigel Lawson and John Biffen, none of them shrinking liberal violets. Even the prime minister was unenthusiastic. After all, she had said not long before: \"I do not believe in retaliatory strikes that are against international law.\" She refused to support Israel when it bombed the PLO in Tunis, asking what the American reaction would be if she \"bombed the Provos in Dundalk\". </p> <p>That same year, in one of the least known but most remarkable episodes of her prime ministership, Thatcher gave the US secretary of state, George Shultz, a tongue lashing, which is recorded in the American NSC archives. Did Yitzhak Shamir ever intend to negotiate over the West Bank and Jerusalem, she asked, or did he believe all biblical Israel belonged to him? Israel's claim to be the only democracy in the Middle East was ruined by the way it \"denies basic rights\" to the Palestinians, and Israel was \"simply holding the world to ransom\". She angrily told Shultz that the US was the only power which could do anything about this, but instead it acquiesced in every Israeli action. </p> <p>April this year provided a stark contrast. Our current prime minister gave his fawning approval to a deal between President Bush and Ariel Sharon, which tore up existing American and British policy. It was an unprecedented personal and national humiliation for Blair - one that Thatcher would never have conceded. </p> <p>For the Tories this is not just a history lesson. If they do have a future, it must surely be as a libertarian party at home, and as an Anglo-Gaullist one abroad. That means healthy scepticism about undemocratic centralism in Europe but, just as importantly, equal scepticism about American actions, interests and motives. It would be right, it would be popular - and it would be in Tory tradition. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Geoffrey Wheatcroft's book The Strange Death of Tory England is published by Penguin in the new year </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:wheaty@compuserve.com\">wheaty@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "I arrived at the Conservative conference to hear the great throbbing hit A Little Less Conversation. It was Elvis! Proof for the Tories that there is life after death, at least if you have the remix. <p>They even had a chairman under the age of 30, possibly the only such person in the hall. He invited the mayor of Bournemouth to speak. </p> <p>\"Mr Mayor!\" he said. She turned out to be a woman. How embarrassing, one thought. But he did it again. The Tories are the only party that proves its hip, happening credentials by using a form of address that must have seemed dated 60 years ago. </p> <p>Liam Fox, the co-chairman, rose to address us. \"We have come to Bournemouth with a spring in our step!\" he said. The first porkie, and the conference not one minute old! The party was going from strength to strength, he said. Nobody sniggered. </p> <p>He ended with a series of crazed battle cries, illustrated with wild hand movements: \"If you believe the first duty of government is defence of the country, you are a Conservative! If you believe that the British people should have control of their own destiny, you are a Conservative! </p> <p>\"If you have mad, staring eyes, and chop your hands down like an axe-murderer dismembering his victim on the kitchen table, then you are a Conservative!\" </p> <p>(Of course he didn't say the last bit. But he should have.) </p> <p>I slipped out to catch Boris Johnson at a fringe meeting on the arts. The small room was heaving. The place was in the grip of Bozzamania. As usual, Boris was late. </p> <p>I asked his father, Stanley Johnson, if he had been late being born. \"No, I think he came when he was expected,\" he mused. If so, it was the last time in his life. </p> <p>Finally he arrived and made a fine, well-chamfered, Bozza-type speech. </p> <p>He was all in favour of public funding for the arts. \"But we're not going to stuff the mouths of every concrete poet with gold,\" he promised, \"much as I would like to subsidise Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, to stop them, from, er ...\" </p> <p>Back in the hall they were showing bonkers videos in which members of the shadow cabinet revealed themselves as human beings, in case we weren't sure. </p> <p>What did they like most about Britain? David Cameron said it was our great sense of humour. \"The fact that two people can sit in a pub for half an hour talking about the best way to get to Devon,\" he said puzzlingly, perhaps a jab at those sleazy French people who rarely spend 10 minutes debating the way to Devon. </p> <p>\"What is the way to your heart?\" came up. \"Only my wife knows that, and I'm going to keep it that way,\" said David Willetts, romantically. \"A nice steak and salad,\" said Michael Ancram, less so. </p> <p>Oliver Letwin gave one of his speeches in which you think he's going to burst into tears. He stood alone on stage, making embarrassed hand movements. He stood with hands out like a very scared slip fielder who wished the ball wasn't so hard. </p> <p>\"Only the other day, Nicholas Soames and I were working through the fat bureaucracies, trying to slim them down!\" he shouted, and nobody sniggered then either. </p> <p>And John Redwood! \"Yes, I'm back!\" he cried. He gave a fighting, truculent speech. But he can't resist awful puns. \"They should call it Not-work Rail!\" And, of Peter Mandelson, \"There's no place like Dome!\" </p> <p>I heard a few, faint chuckles from the hall, as if a pair of badgers were clearing their throats.</p>",
  "The four-day House of Lords hearing this week is make or break for the home secretary David Blunkett's emergency anti-terrorism legislation, with no appeal to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg if he loses. <p>Mr Blunkett is acutely aware that he cannot bring forward any proposals for a major extension or reform of his anti-terrorism law until the House of Lords hearing is out of the way. </p> <p>Although some limited changes may be included in this autumn's bill to set up a British version of the FBI, the main legislation reforming the anti-terrorism laws is now not expected until December at the very earliest, and is more likely to appear immediately after the general election. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett has time. The current legislation, the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which allows the indefinite detention of suspected international terrorists, is being tested this week in the House of Lords. It contains \"sunset clauses\", which mean that the emergency powers must be renewed by parliament or they will lapse - but they do not expire until November 2006. </p> <p>It is the home secretary's intention that the replacement legislation should also incorporate the Terrorism Act 2000, which deals with domestic terrorists. </p> <p>When Mr Blunkett put forward some \"concrete suggestions\" to launch the debate about the next steps during his trip to India in February, he was so taken aback by the ferocity of the response that he dropped the idea of changing the standard of proof in terrorism cases. </p> <p>But his other proposals, including \"pre-emptive\" secret trials of suspected British terrorists before state-selected judges and vetted counsel, are still on the table. </p> <p>He is known to be considering the introduction of a new offence of \"acts preparatory to terrorism\" and the use of civil orders against those on the periphery of terrorist groups raising money or making propaganda. </p> <p>The home secretary has recently spoken of his support for a change in the rules to allow phonetap evidence to be used in terrorism cases. But the detailed work has not yet been finished on the kind of safeguards that are needed to prevent the disclosure of \"sensitive capabilities\" - information revealing how the security services go about their business - when the plans are published. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that the government is not yet ready to publish its proposals, and final decisions on what should be done are not close. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett is said still to be willing to consider \"any realistic alternative that takes account of the government's human rights obligations.\" </p> <p>Defeat as a result of this week's House of Lords appeal would deal a fatal blow to these plans, as it would amount to the judiciary striking down Mr Blunkett's most controversial piece of legislation. </p> <p>Nobody knows what the precise impact of such a ruling would be, but it is likely that the security services would press for those currently detained to be prosecuted for lesser offences, such as credit card fraud, rather than to face their immediate release. </p> <p>The lack of any appeal for the home secretary against an adverse House of Lords ruling means that the stakes this week are at the highest level. He is hoping that the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, can convince the judges that the national emergency facing Britain is serious enough to justify the derogation from the European convention on human rights that is needed to allow foreign terrorist suspects to be interned. </p> <p>If he wins, however, those interned under his anti-terrorism law can take their case to the Strasbourg judges - the court that granted Mr Blunkett his derogation from the human rights convention in the first place. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor</p>",
  "The way other European countries deal with suspected international terrorists was examined by the Home Office when Britain's anti-terrorism law was drafted after September 11 2001. <p><b>France</b> Since the 1980s has had an offence of \"associating with a wrongdoer\", used to detain and prosecute terrorist suspects. It allows a specialist judge to order the indefinite detention of a suspect before prosecution. It is much more widely drawn than the English conspiracy law and has been used for more prosecutions. Unlike Britain, France will deport suspected terrorists to Algeria, Jordan and Egypt, but not if they would face a death sentence. </p> <p><b>Germany</b> Has strengthened its anti-terrorism law since September 11, but unlike the UK has a general offence of terrorism, which includes criminal prosecution of those who support a terrorist organisation. Terrorist cases can be held in secret if state security interests are at risk. </p> <p>Suspected terrorists who apply for asylum can be restricted in their movements by issuing them with a \"geographically restricted identity card\" so the security services can keep them under surveillance. </p> <p><b>Norway</b> has banned terrorism suspects from claiming asylum. </p> <p><b>Sweden</b> has extradited two people who were denied refugee status to Egypt, to face trial on terrorist charges after assurances they would not face the death sentence. </p>",
  "Your support for Billy Bragg's proposals on Lords reform is welcome (Leader, October 1). Indirect elections based on general election votes may not be perfect, but they represent the best chance we have of reaching consensus. This is no mean feat given the failure by government after government since 1911 to get agreement on reforming the second chamber. Alongside membership changes, it will be essential to modernise the arcane procedures of the house and to prevent legislative filibusters. <p>There is no reason why the Lords should follow the Commons procedures in scrutinising legislation. The second chamber could enhance its role in holding ministers to account by replacing many of the current repetitive and arcane procedures beloved of the house and focus on the key issues in bills. </p> <p>How remarkable that after so many attempts at reform, a passionate singer and songwriter looks like he is finally getting this country a modern second chamber.<br> <b>Philip Hunt</b><br> House of Lords </p> <p>For seven years, New Labour has failed to carry out its manifesto pledge on reform of the Lords. Instead they have manoeuvred for a \"Tony's cronies\" appointed second chamber. Now they suggest the worst possible version of an elected chamber: party lists reflecting general election results. </p> <p>Yet the essence of any second chamber is that its make-up must be different from the first chamber. There is no point in having an upper house that reflects the composition of the lower house. </p> <p>The reason New Labour now looks with favour on this idea is, of course, that it would reinforce the power of the large parties. Instead of cronies by appointment it would give us cronies by party list.<br> <b>Mike Davies</b><br> Alliance for Green Socialism </p> <p>You are quite right to congratulate Billy Bragg on his crusade for the secondary mandate system to replace the appointed House of Lords. He has managed to keep reform on the agenda at a time when it looked like it might have been buried. </p> <p>The idea behind the secondary mandate is that direct election is not an option. The decision of Labour conference, supported by the NEC, to call for a system that is \"as democratic as possible\" demonstrates that this is palpably not the case. It also fails by the constitutional affairs secretary Charlie Falconer's own demand for a system that is \"much more representative of the people it serves\". </p> <p>By its very nature, the system can only reflect the preoccupations and priorities of the political parties that appoint the closed lists the system is based on.

  "<p>It makes me very angry when people say these are not serious courses,\" says Dorothy Hobson, senior lecturer in media and cultural studies at Wolverhampton University. So what can a media course offer to the potential student, or career-changer, and what difference does it make when it comes to getting a job in an ever more competitive industry?</p> <p>Studying media is, says Hobson, \"vital whether you go into it or not, as it is such a huge part of everyone's lives now\".</p> <p>According to Peter Meech, director of undergraduate programmes at Stirling University's department of film and media studies, such courses are popular \"because they connect closely with young people's everyday lives. There's a huge appetite for understanding how the media work and the contribution they make to popular culture and politics.\"</p> <p>Media studies courses vary from the theoretical to the practical - and then, of course, there are specific programmes for different areas within the media: public relations, journalism, film, and so on.</p> <p>\"The media course was very useful,\" says Mark Daly, once young journalist of the year, who followed a BA in Stirling's film and media department with a journalism postgraduate diploma at Strathclyde and has been at the BBC almost three years. \"I made my first film last year. Seven or eight years on, all the skills I had learned were coming back to me.\" Stirling's course is broad-based, with specialisation in later years. \"I did lots of practical stuff, made loads of films,\" says Daly.</p> <p>Wolverhampton's course is much more theoretical, although there are optional practical elements, such as video production. \"A lot is theories of media,\" says Hobson, \"how the media works and presents the world to viewers and readers.\"</p> <p>Both courses boast an impressive array of guest lecturers. \"I organise seminars where I've bought in top professionals such as Jeremy Issacs and Greg Dyke,\" says Hobson.</p> <p>Those who opt for a more specific journalism course can expect a grounding in the writing and other skills needed for the job. \"At Strathclyde we learned shorthand and law, which are very useful,\" says Daly. But, he warns, \"the practical side is very dependent on the actual tutor\".</p> <p>Julie Bieles quit a job as a systems analyst at the BBC to do a postgraduate diploma from City University. Before that, she was a management consultant. \"I was looking to do something else, and I noticed an advert for the City periodicals journalism course,\" she says. She had done some writing for a sailing club magazine - \"so it wasn't such a random choice\".</p> <p>The nine months at City taught her \"a lot about news writing\". She adds: \"We did basic politics and local government reporting. There were a lot of practical things. Early on we had a press conference with Transport for London.\"</p> <p>In terms of feature writing, she says: \"I didn't find it too useful in terms of writing style, but it was good for confidence.\" In the third term, she wrote a 5,000-word piece for the Observer's Sport Monthly magazine on the future of British tennis. She finished last July and got a job at the end of the summer as technical reporter for trade publication Plastics and Rubber Weekly.</p> <p>Practical work experience is encouraged on media courses, but students shouldn't expect it to be handed out on a plate. According to Hobson, this is deliberate policy. \"One of the skills you need is to get yourself a placement,\" she says. \"I have contacts I could get for them but that's not what the broadcasters want. I tell them what to do and how to look for people to contact.\" Stirling encourages students to get as much work experience as possible, but there are no placements.</p> <p>Daly says the Strathclyde journalism course was useful for getting work experience: \"I went to a news agency. They give you a bit of assistance, point you in the right direction.\"</p> <p>So far, so good. But when it comes to getting a job, just how much does a degree in media studies help? Meech stresses that this shouldn't be the only reason for choosing the subject. \"A media degree, like any other, should first and foremost be an intellectually challenging experience with lifelong benefits.\" He adds, however, that, as media organisations cut back on training budgets, they come \"more and more\" to depend on graduates who already have the relevant skills.</p> <p>\"Some do get into the media,\" Hobson says of Wolverhampton's graduates. \"Some start off as runners at the BBC or at Central.\" But, she adds: \"A lot do go into PR to start with, which they don't necessarily come in thinking they will do.\"</p> <p>Rather than expect to jump straight into a job, students might do better to consider a BA in media studies as a stepping stone to one of the highly competitive postgraduate courses in journalism. Daly credits his degree at Stirling with getting him on to the Strathclyde course, which, in turn, enabled him to get \"a foot in the door\", a job on a local newspaper.</p> <p>Some, of course, start in journalism with skills learned less formally, for example on a student newspaper. But according to Daly, a qualification in journalism is a must. \"People wouldn't take you seriously without it.\"</p> <p><strong>From fly fisherman to film tycoon</strong></p> <p>Jim Adamson earned his living tying fishing flies before his BA in media studies at Stirling University in 1994-98. \"Concurrent with that I had done a degree in the arts at the Open University,\" he says. \"I left school at 15 so I always had the impression I needed to get some sort of education.\"</p> <p>He began at Stirling intending to become an academic, \"but towards the end of the second year, I came across a card on the noticeboard asking if any students would like to film the centenary of the Church of Scotland's Women's Guild in Stirling\". Together with a group of friends - \"Marxists to a man, and atheists\" - he decided \"to see if we could engage with this in a neutral way. So we hired a camera from Radio Rentals and shot this thing.\"</p> <p>The Women's Guild was \"delighted\", and Adamson \"decided that was what I was meant to do\". He graduated in 1998 with a first and several producing projects under his belt. \"On the basis of that, I got admission to a postgraduate course in Dundee.\"</p> <p>While there, he won the BP Expo award for best student documentary. Finding no one \"stupid enough\" to give him a first job at producer level, he set up his own company. Speakeasy Productions, of which he is MD, is based near Perth. It now employs 18, and has a corporate client list that includes various government departments, Intelligent Finance and Scottish National Heritage.</p>",
  "<p>In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams writes that lab mice are pan-dimensional creatures that participate in scientific experiments only to study humans. If this were so, and lab mice did rule the world, what would they make of current efforts in the 3Rs - the reduction, refinement and replacement of animals in research? Would they go on strike? How would we know?</p> <p>Such questions may seem far-fetched, but research projects into the welfare and behaviour of animals used in scientific experiments are being funded under a new government initiative. A total of \u00a3500,000 is up for grabs for projects in the 3Rs lasting up to three years. The grants will be some of the first given by the new national centre for the 3Rs, set up by the government in May.</p> <p>The centre, building on the foundation laid by the Medical Research Council's centre for best practice for animals in research (CBPAR), will be awarding funding to projects that address at least one of the 3Rs. Projects can be stand-alone or form part of a larger project. Eligible costs range from researchers' salaries and extra research hands to new equipment and result dissemination.</p> <p>The 3Rs are integral to the legislation on animal research passed in the 1980s. Replacement means finding alternatives to animal experimentation, for example by using in vitro studies, computer modelling or research on humans. Refinement is to do with alleviating the discomfort of animals used in studies. Reduction means finding ways of using fewer animals to obtain the same results, for example by using new techniques or redesigning an experiment.</p> <p>The latter is likely to be of growing concern when new European chemicals legislation comes into force - some have said this will require a drastic increase in the number of animals used in experiments.</p> <p>The 3Rs centre is governed by an independent board of experts. It includes two representatives from industry, and people from the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare and the RSPCA. More extreme animal rights groups are not represented on the board. The reason for this, the board's chair says, is that it would be counterproductive for the board to house organisations that signed up to only one of the 3Rs - reduction.</p> <p>To put the \u00a3500,000 available for new projects in context, the average cost of projects funded by CBPAR in the past was from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3200,000. Two research projects - one looking at the behaviour of genetically modified mice, and another investigating cancer pain in rodents - have already been funded by the new centre to the tune of \u00a3360,000. Hence, the \u00a3500,000 funding round is likely to stretch only to a handful of projects, but centre staff say more funding will be coming on stream in future years.</p> <p>The priority areas for the centre will be discussed with stakeholders at a meeting in January next year. The meeting will also look into how better to coordinate existing efforts in the 3Rs - another key responsibility for the new centre. Butsketch out your research project before then, since the deadline for this round of applications is January 17.

  "<p>Tomorrow, University College London will ask for \u00a3300m - the latest university to overcome British reticence in money matters and conclude that if you don't ask, you don't get.</p> <p>Cambridge and Bristol are gearing up for big centenary appeals (though 700 years apart). Following the lead of Oxford and Edinburgh, most old universities now have development offices busy tracking down alumni and potential donors.</p> <p>UCL claims its appeal is the biggest philanthropic campaign ever launched by a UK university, and although it is puny against some of the billion-dollar efforts in the US, this looks like the route down which higher education institutions in this country are heading.</p> <p>This increasingly professional drive to raise funds from alumni, business and charities is taking place against the background of a shrinking proportion of state funding for higher education across the developed world. In the UK, more of the cost is being shifted from taxpayers to students and their parents, with the introduction of variable tuition fees; in continental Europe, fees are under discussion; while in countries such as Sweden, where fees are anathema, students are being asked to borrow to cover living costs.</p> <p>The process is most advanced in the US, where the public universities, which educate the vast majority of students, have seen their funding from the states whittled away. (Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's cuts to the budget of the University of California were just the latest evidence of the trend, forcing the university to do what it always does in this situation: bump up fees.)</p> <p>The prospect of energetic fundraising by universities is welcomed by vice-chancellors such as Eric Thomas, of Bristol, who recognises that it has become a major part of his job description. He wants the government to help universities set up fundraising operations. \"It's massively enabling. This money is not in the hands of the funding council or the Department for Education and Skills - it's money you can use for yourself. It's hard work, mind you, but it's liberating.\"</p> <p>But the appeals boom has no appeal for many new universities, who see themselves being left even further behind the wealthiest institutions. Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex and spokesman for the Campaign for Mainstream Universities, said it would exacerbate existing inequalities. \"The more you have, the more you raise. When it comes to building up endowment funds, for 90% of the sector it is decades away, if it ever happens.\"</p> <p>Bristol raised \u00a3100m over a decade and Thomas argues that an investment of \u00a3100,000 in fundraising will produce between \u00a3600,000 and \u00a31m for a university. This takes time to build up to, and he recognises that universities will need help to set up development offices and get started.</p> <p>He is undeterred by the frequent cry that the US has a different culture of giving, and says taxbreaks in the UK are now just as generous - it's just that they are too complicated. \"People say we don't have a culture of giving, but we don't have a culture of asking. You don't get anything if you don't ask for it.\" He points out that American public universities didn't start professional fundraising until the 1970s and 1980s, but have since raised impressive sums.</p> <p>\"The messages are simple: we can do it, it's valid because we are charities pursuing honourable aims and there is no evidence that it displaces state funding. What it does is add value and excellence,\" says Thomas, who cites the motto of the University of Kansas development office - \"to give this state a better university than it could otherwise afford\".</p> <p>He chaired a government task force that earlier this year produced a report, Increased Voluntary Giving to Higher Education. \"There is a well-described business called fundraising, which will bring returns if institutions invest in it and do it professionally. We have the wealthiest generation over the age of 50 we have ever had, and they are going to give their money to the least number of children.\"</p> <p>Tax changes on the US model would help by allowing people to give lump sums - or property - during their lifetimes and to receive the interest while they live. The university would be assured of the donation immediately, and it would also celebrate the donor (if he or she wanted recognition) while they could still enjoy the praise. The report also urged simplifying the present Giftaid tax scheme to encourage large donations. Thomas adds: \"It has to be led from the top if you want to be successful - that was a key message from our US visit. It's the president who gets the biggest donors. And presidents have to give themselves. It's very difficult to ask people to give if you don't give yourself.\" Some American university heads spend half their time fundraising and Thomas expects to be spending a day a week or more when Bristol's centenary appeal gets going.</p> <p>His appeal is currently in its \"silent phase\". Under the rules of this increasingly professional game, an institution will not usually launch an appeal until it is sure of a third or half of the money. From then on, any money that comes the university's way is counted as part of the appeal, whether or not the donation was coming anyway. Institutions also tend to be studiously vague about a final date - they may be \"over a decade\" or \"centred on\" an anniversary, as it is as well to leave a bit of leeway if giving is not as brisk as hoped.</p> <p>(For example, council members at the Royal Institution, headed by Baroness Greenfield, are reported to be anxious that they will not raise \u00a35m matching funding by the beginning of next year in time to start building a new museum. Last week, she insisted there was \"every reason to believe we will reach the sum required\".)</p> <p>As well as commitment from the vice-chancellor - big donors want to be wooed by the top man or woman - it helps to have high-profile alumni to drum up support, says Alisdaire Lockhart, head of UCL's development office. Tomorrow, Digby Jones, director general of the CBI, is being wheeled out alongside the provost, Malcolm Grant, for the launch. Other distinguished UCL graduates will carry the message to north America and south-east Asia, where the campaign hopes to do well. A quarter of the \u00a3300m will come from outside the UK, the university expects.</p> <p>A university needs projects that will appeal to donors - no one contributes to cleaning the drains, points out Lockhart. In UCL's case, the spotlight is on the Ear Institute, the Institute for Women's Health, the Spinal Repair Unit and the Panopticon (a new museum). There is also a range of bursaries, scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships - people like the idea of helping struggling students or junior academics.</p> <p>Some donors want their name on a building; others want total anonymity and withdraw the gift if their names leak out. But in all cases, success depends on nurturing and maintaining contact, says Lockhart, who came to UCL from Bristol.</p> <p>A reliable database of alumni is the essential starter kit.</p> <p>Alison Woolley, a senior development manager at UCL responsible for US contacts, will be wooing donors for a chair of American history (cost: about \u00a31.3m) and trying to utilise the loan of part of the university's Petrie collection of Egyptian archaeology to Atlanta next year as a means of courting alumni.</p> <p>There are about 5,000 UCL alumni in the US, many successful British emigrants. \"You want to find people who feel fondly about UCL or who have a cause close to their hearts - somebody who has lost a relative to cancer might be interested in helping to fund the institute of cancer science.\"</p> <p>She concentrates on major givers. Obviously, they are wealthy but, she says, there are surprises. \"They're not all CEOs.\"</p> <p>British graduates are more sceptical than Americans, she feels, and academics often don't understand the process. \"They like the money at the end, but they don't feel comfortable being involved in asking for donations. There is a lot of reticence.\"</p> <p>American graduates are by now used to the hard sell from their universities. \"Some of them quite like the fact that we are a British university and do things a bit differently, but others say 'you lot are far too polite and should be much more upfront',\" says Woolley.</p> <p>For Middlesex and other new universities, the prospects of soliciting millions is remote, however the asking is done. \"It is going to be some generations before universities like Middlesex build up a significant cohort of wealthy alumni or people associated with the university who want to give endowments. We are not an endowment-free zone, but we don't get gifts like the \u00a320m Said business school at Oxford,\" says Driscoll. He argues that the retreat from the socialisation of higher education after the second world war, when universities became almost totally dependent on state funding, is benefiting elite institutions at the expense of the majority. Instead of compensating the poorer universities, the government is pouring help into the richest, he believes.</p> <p>\"It should let universities who can fund themselves do so, and be independent, and let the state use tax revenue - paid by parents of all students and alumni of all institutions - to support quality across the sector,\" he says. \"The government should look to the quality of experience for the typical student instead of focusing on a very small number of universities and reinforcing divisions.\"</p>",
  "<p>With the news so full of claims about leadership, it's a good time to look for basic research on that subject. Buried in the heaps of academic vagary about leadership is, at least, one useful, practical nugget.</p> <p>There is a simple question that every competent leader keeps in mind, and no incompetent leader does: \"What can go wrong?\"</p> <p>Does a leader worry over that question, or ignore it? Find out, and you've seen a reliable litmus test of whether that leader is incompetent.</p> <p>This leadership litmus test is, or should be, associated with the name of Captain Edward A Murphy, Jr, of the United States air force. Capt Murphy, now deceased, is the Murphy of Murphy's Law.</p> <p>Almost exactly a year ago, at the 13th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, Murphy and two colleagues were honoured for jointly giving birth in 1949 to Murphy's Law. Murphy's Law is the basic engineering principle that \"if there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe, someone will do it\". Or, in other words: \"If anything can go wrong, it will.\"</p> <p>Murphy's Law is perhaps the most basic of all engineering principles. Every competent engineer has a deep, healthy respect for Murphy's Law. So does every competent sports team manager, business executive, military officer, mother, mayor, or leader of any undertaking on any level.</p> <p>The litmus test applies to national and other political leaders, too. It reveals incompetent presidents, prime ministers and dog-catchers.</p> <p>Competent leaders try, as a matter of vital habit, to anticipate how their best-laid plans can go agley. Incompetent leaders do not. The worst of them work hard to ignore reality's deviations from their announced sequence of triumphs.</p> <p>All competent leaders obsess over Murphy's Law. But there has been little academic research done on this unglamorous aspect of leadership. The study-of-leadership field has statelier concerns, such as: Leader self-regulation: The role of self-efficacy and \"multiple intelligences\". That's the title of a book chapter co-authored by professor SE Murphy of the Kravis Leadership Institute, at Claremont McKenna University in Claremont, California. Despite the co-author's name, the study does not obsess about the need for leaders to obsess about Murphy's Law.</p> <p>The historian Barbara Tuchman was a rare detective in tracking down leaders who ignored Murphy's Law. Tuchman's book The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam, though never mentioning the phrase, analyses how political and military leaders disrespected Murphy's law. And how they suffered for it.</p> <p>By the way ... historian Nick Spark tried to confirm how Murphy's Law got its moniker. His seemingly simple quest became an Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole odyssey.

  "<p>At the end of last month, Ofsted published a report showing that the number of pupils taking modern languages at GCSE is expected to drop sharply this year, after a 30% decline in take-up. It inspired David Bell, the chief inspector of schools, to make an impassioned plea for action.</p> <p>\"Schools, teachers and parents must now work to ensure that pupils recognise the benefits of learning a foreign language, and make sure that young people have the opportunity and desire to continue studying modern foreign languages at key stage 4 and beyond,\" he said.</p> <p>Au contraire, said Stephen Twigg, the junior schools minister. \"We do not want to go back to the old days when we tried to force-feed languages to 15-year-olds who had no aptitude or interest.\"</p> <p>That statement caused some bemusement in council offices across England. This is the same Stephen Twigg who, on July 5, wrote a letter to all local education authority (LEA) chief education officers under the heading \"Languages entitlement 14-16\". The letter has since been passed to the Guardian. \"In the knowledge society of the 21st century, language competence and intercultural understanding are not optional extras, they are an essential part of being a citizen,\" Twigg said.</p> <p>He went on: \"It is therefore a matter of some concern that we are receiving reports that schools are reducing languages provision, in some cases significantly. Schools remain under a statutory requirement to offer languages at KS4 so that young people have an entitlement to take languages as an option.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) insisted there was no contradiction in these statements. \"We just want to ensure that anyone who wants to study modern languages at GCSE can do so.\"</p> <p>However, the message taken in town halls was that the government was still utterly behind modern languages at KS4 and that it was up to the LEAs to sort out the situation.</p> <p>\"LEAs have no control over the curriculum and ministers know that full well,\" says Graham Lane, chairman of the 14-19 education group for the Local Government Association. \"If schools are dropping modern languages, it's a direct result of government policy.</p> <p>\"I told ministers that making foreign languages optional would be a disaster, and it's proved to be the case. The government has done schoolchildren a huge disservice. They've reduced the employability of young people at a stroke.\"</p> <p>Back in 2002, the DfES published its national languages strategy. It sounded bold and innovative, starting with the statement: \"For too long we have failed to value language skills or recognise the contribution to society, to the economy and to raising standards in schools. This has led to a national cycle of underperformance.\"</p> <p>The strategy continued by calling for increased provision in primary schools. But the most significant change was the downgrading of modern languages from compulsory to an \"entitlement\".</p> <p>The DfES apparatchiks apparently believed they had found in \"entitlement\" a word that would get them off the hook of charges of cultural philistinism. Put simply, it meant schools were obliged to offer at least one modern language at KS4, but pupils were not obliged to study it. Even though the changes were not officially due to come in until last month, many schools chose to scale back their language provision immediately.</p> <p>\"It has become increasingly hard to recruit good language teachers,\" says one headteacher, \"and many schools would rather abandon the unequal struggle rather than deliver an unsatisfactory curriculum. Modern languages tend to be perceived both as irrelevant, as English is a global language, and academically difficult. With schools under league table pressure to get five GCSE passes at A*-C, many are pushing students into subjects that are considered to be easier.\"</p> <p>Numbers taking languages at GCSE have gone into freefall. To take just one exam board: in 2002, the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) had 73,000 candidates for GCSE French. By 2003, that number had declined to 55,000, and this year was down still further, to just 46,000.</p> <p>Teresa Tinsley, assistant director of communications for CILT, the National Centre for Languages, says the government rather misjudged the effects of its actions. \"My impression is that it was rather taken aback by the speed with which so many schools effectively dropped languages. It introduced the changes too soon.\"</p> <p>Tinsley is keen to point out that all is not lost. \"There are schools in Sheffield and the Black Country looking at alternate models of teaching languages, such as combining them with business,\" she says. \"But there needs to be a great deal more. It's not just the government we have to convince - it's the schools, the parents and the teachers.\"</p> <p>Grove school in Market Drayton, Shropshire, has battled the odds and achieved specialist status in modern languages. \"It's been good for the school,\" says headteacher Richard Arrowsmith. \"We've had enormously positive results with our outreach work, teaching languages in 10 local primary schools.\"</p> <p>But Arrowsmith is now fed up. He could just about cope with the changes in the curriculum, but he believes he is fighting a second offensive with the AQA. Something strange has happened to his school's results. And it appears it is not the only one to be hit. \"In 2003, our first year of specialist status, our A-C GCSE passes in French fell from 50% to just 27%. One girl who got nine As or A*s in other subjects, got just a D. That can't be right.</p> <p>\"Our passes in German and Italian also fell, though not so significantly. We were shocked, but thought it was possible we had taken our eye off the ball while establishing the new systems demanded by our specialist status,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We should have asked for re-marks then and there, as our results this summer have been little better. It's possible that our teaching isn't up to scratch, but I really don't think this is the case. We have some great teachers and I have sat in on many of their lessons and can find no fault with them.\"</p> <p>After the publication of the AQA GCSE results this summer, an online modern languages forum for teachers went white-hot. \"Has anyone out there had a disaster today with their GCSE results cos we have?\" was one posting. There were dozens of replies: \"To say I had a few disappointed kids is an understatement,\" said one. Another read: \"This year we had an unprecedented 60% Ds\" and \"God, I'm working hard not to take this all personally\".</p> <p>AQA admits there was a national drop in A-C passes of 2.4% across the three exam boards - AQA, Edexcel and OCR - in 2003, but says adjustments were made and results are now back on track. The schools don't quite see it that way.</p> <p>\"The problems began two years ago when AQA changed the regulations and no longer allowed the use of dictionaries,\" says Maria Richards, Grove's former head of modern languages. \"However, the standard of question remained the same, so the exam became de facto harder.\"</p> <p>AQA denies this. \"We did make allowances for the absence of a dictionary,\" a spokesperson says. \"For instance, instead of asking a candidate to order a loaf of bread, he or she is now allowed to choose their own item of food.\"</p> <p>But it's not just the dictionaries that have been at issue. \"I taught a class of C/D candidates and tutored them thoroughly in what standard they needed to achieve,\" says Chris Pollard, a modern languages teacher at Grove school. \"I sat in on their speaking exam and ticked the boxes as each candidate fulfilled the relevant task. I was confident half of the class of 22 had done enough to get a C. In the event only four were given a C. I just don't understand how it was marked.\"</p> <p>AQA insists it is more than happy to look at any individual problems a school may have, but a comparison of the French GCSE results in 2004 across the three boards does tell an interesting story. Just 49.8% of those sitting AQA got a C or better, while the figure for Edexcel was 61.4% and that for OCR was 70.2%.</p> <p>Arrowsmith has a few thoughts on what happened. \"It has been the less able students who have been dropping out of modern languages,\" he says. \"Although exams are supposed to be criterion-referenced, it's possible that the shift in ability has seen the pass mark raise, as students who were formerly in the middle band of achievement are now near the bottom.\"</p> <p>So it could be harder to get the same grade, adding to the disincentive to take languages. Poor results mean even fewer students will go on to AS and A2, and KS3 students will see no point in working at all.</p> <p>\"The government is stuck in a cleft stick,\" says Stephen Fawkes, trustee for the Association of Language Learning. \"Only last week, Denis MacShane, the minister for Europe, was talking up the value of modern languages, while the DfES is effectively sidelining them. It's hard to see the government putting its hands up and admitting it got it wrong, because that's not what governments do.\"</p>",
  "Control of education policy should be taken out of the hands of politicians and given to an independent commission, to end decades of party political \"tampering\", the chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, Martin Stephen, said yesterday. <p>Dr Stephen, high master of St Paul's school, London, told more than 200 members at their annual meeting in St Andrews that just as the government had handed interest-rate decisions to a committee of economics experts, so it should give up responsibility for deciding the shape of secondary education. </p> <p>The task should be given to a standing commission drawn from employers, universities, parents and teachers, which would design a school structure designed to outlast \"one, two or even three governments\". </p> <p>He also proposed a new category of highly qualified specialist teachers for the brightest children. </p> <p>Insisting that he believed politicians meant well in introducing reforms, he said: \"The truth is that we have an educational system in the UK that arouses deep dissent and dissatisfaction, and the final responsibility for that system is held by the successive governments who have redesigned our education system so that it bears a resemblance to a wound operated on so often that all that is left is scar tissue.\" </p> <p>Dr Stephen's words got a curt response from the Department for Education and Skills, which said: \"We live in a democracy where the general public elect people to reform and improve public services, including education.\" </p> <p>Dr Stephen declined to point to specific education policies which had caused particular damage, and said the forthcoming Tomlinson report on 14-19 qualifications, which is expected to recommend radical reforms, was regarded positively by independent schools. </p> <p>But the current mix of secondary school categories created confusion, he said, while in the postwar system of grammar, technical and secondary modern schools \"at least we all knew where we were\". </p> <p>Employers and universities were better placed than politicians to decide on the long-term educational needs of the country, he suggested. </p> <p>Turning in his valedictory speech as chairman to his proposal for specialist academic teachers - the highest qualified graduates to teach the brightest pupils - he said it was \"grossly politically incorrect\" yet honest to admit that not all teachers could teach all abilities. </p> <p>\"Why do we damn a top mathematician or physicist when they cannot intuitively relate to a pupil who does not share their passion for the subject? Why do we insist that all teachers should be all things to all pupils? Is this not the worst manifestation of the one size fits all philosophy?\" </p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, condemning the idea as elitist, said: \"The suggestion that the most highly qualified teachers should teach the best pupils is one of the most outrageous proposals I have heard for a long time. </p> <p>\"Youngsters who are below average or who are underachieving need just as good a teacher as the rest of the pupil population.\" </p> <p>Dr Stephen said his idea was \"the complete opposite of elitist\", and was about providing an opportunity that did not currently exist.</p>",
  "<p>Larry Summers strides into the waiting area outside his office, and shakes my hand before I am out of the chair. It's a beautiful, warm afternoon at Harvard, a week and a day into term. Freshmen beam and all but skip across the Old Yard. Lovers - or maybe just friends - sit back-to-back, reading hefty textbooks. Outside the science building, the stand for the Harvard cheerleaders is making a lot more noise than its only competition, two serious men in orange T-shirts by the Stop the War table.</p> <p>It's weather to take it easy in, but already today Summers, Harvard president (the US version of vice-chancellor) has met a star academic he is trying to recruit to the biology department; spoken to the search committee, which is looking for a new dean of the school of design; liaised with the financial vice-president about guidelines for next year's budgets; lunched with a professor of government about plans for quantitative research in the social sciences; and talked to the community affairs staff about their work in Cambridge, the corner of Boston where Harvard lives. Later he will host a reception for a faculty member who is going to be a professor, and stop by another reception that brings together academics and students concerned with human rights issues. It's not, he says, an atypical day.</p> <p>A few months after George Bush took over at the White House, Summers, Bill Clinton's last Treasury secretary, moved into a not extravagantly large office in Massachusetts Hall, below student lodgings. He is Harvard's 27th president, a new link in a chain that began with Henry Dunster, a clergyman from Bury, in 1640, four years after the college was founded, making it the post with the longest continuous history in the US.</p> <p>This job carries on, just as before, regardless of whether Bush wins again. On some issues, such as financial aid for students or stem cell research, it might make a difference who is in the White House, but not much. \"One of the great differences between working at Harvard and working in Washington is that the time frames are very different,\" Summers says. \"In Washington the long run is the next news magazine, Monday. Here, scholars are trying to write books that will influence thought 50 years from now. I don't think the fundamental importance of what we do is much affected by who is in power at any particular moment.\"</p> <p>Since long before Summers took over, Harvard has been just about universally recognised as the most successful university in the world. It leads the latest league table, produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, of global higher education institutions. Forty Nobel prize-winners work, or have worked, here. The value of its endowment has gone up from $19.3bn (\u00a310.7bn) to $22.6bn (\u00a312.6bn) in a year. The cut used for running costs, a mere $800m (\u00a3444.7m), supplies just a third of the university's income. Despite fees of $39,880 (\u00a322,118), including board and lodging, it continues to attract the best applicants and turns them away at a ratio of about nine to one.</p> <p>There will be plenty of people who wince at those fees. But when British ministers and vice-chancellors look to learn, they tend to look here first, and not just because Harvard is cash-rich. Viz last month's Schwartz report, which encouraged UK admissions officers to adopt the Harvard model.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Summers's three years in charge have not been trouble-free. He has a combative style and gets people's backs up in a way his predecessor, Neil Rudenstine, would not have dreamed of. Summers was in the middle of a row very early on, when the black scholar Cornel West took umbrage at his questioning of the high grades West was awarding and at criticism of a rap CD he made with the Rev Al Sharpton. (West later left for Princeton, and Summers only just held on to the celebrated leader of the African-American studies department, Henry Louis Gates.)</p> <p>He challenged departments to make savings, publicly ordering the Kennedy school of government to get into the black; and, for a time last year, Harvard hands tell the Guardian, the place was awash with nerves, as form-filling and back-covering inhibited academics. He has launched a vast and potentially hazardous review of undergraduate study, to inject more internationalism and, especially, science into the curriculum, with the expectation that every student will go abroad to study, and that each will know the difference between a gene and a chromosome. He also proposes students delaying specialisation in a particular subject until their final year. And professors watch with awe and some trepidation the small matter of plans to build on 260 acres the university has acquired at Allston, just over the Charles river. This will mean some schools being asked to move out of their current homes.</p> <p>\"Well, you know, sometimes fear does the work of reason,\" he says. \"I feel we're making good progress at a pace I think is appropriate, and I hope I've been more successful in infusing a more questioning and challenging attitude with respect to every aspect of the university's traditions ... It's very important that everybody, everywhere here be questioning what they do and that we always try to be a more vigorous and more risk-taking culture.\"</p> <p>Summers, a former economics professor here, was appointed very deliberately because the governing body, the Harvard Corporation, wanted a doer, someone young (he is 50 next month) and robust enough to change it. And he is, as the Boston Globe has it, incapable of hands-off anything.</p> <p>\"More and more of what is most exciting cuts across traditional boundaries and therefore the university needs to work together more effectively, and for that reason I've been a centraliser ... The university's greatest asset is its reputation and that's the common reservoir from which all the schools draw, and therefore we all have a common interest in its maintenance. That means more common policies in some areas than we have had in the past.\"</p> <p>Not least over choosing staff, in which Summers has exercised his right to interfere more. Historian Niall Ferguson is just the latest British academic to be lured there, from New York University. \"We've moved somewhat the pattern of faculty appointments towards recruiting young people before they've done their best work, rather than a more traditional Harvard practice of recruiting the lions of the discipline after they've done their best work,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Sure there are questions and resistances of the kind that are part of any organisation. But I think there's a very good spirit here and I'm very excited.\"</p> <p>Wearing regulation light blue, buttoned-down Oxford shirt and red tie, he speaks quickly throughout our interview, with his feet up on a coffee table. He claws at a can of caffeine-free Diet Coke (the point of that drink is what, exactly?) and a cautious smile presses out from his lips from time to time to emphasise a particular point. He's thinner than you might remember him, but still on the stocky side. It's his position rather than his height that might lead him to offer sermons from on high, but Summers is not into talking as though he's the leader of the global academic enterprise.</p> <p>\"What you do has much more importance than what you say, and I think Harvard has a wonderful set of traditions that need to be closely watched in the academic world and beyond. That gives us a special responsibility to do things that are as significant and innovative as we possibly can. I think leadership in general is better practised than proclaimed.\"</p> <p>He likes speaking in lists, and in the \"practising not proclaiming\" category he mentions the extension of financial aid so no one from a family earning less than $40,000 (\u00a322,140) will have to pay to come here (though they are expected to work to repay some of their grants); work to improve the status of graduates who want to work in education; support for stem cell research; and the establishment of the Broad Institute, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to research genomics.</p> <p>\"I think Harvard is an American university and needs to remain rooted in American traditions,\" he says. \"But if America is going to be what it can be and enjoy what it has the potential to enjoy in the 21st century, I believe it has to be engaged in promoting a better world. An America that stays focused at home or an America that operates only on a narrow conception of its interest is an America that is likely to sell itself short.\"</p> <p>Some UK vice-chancellors, as they try to promote their institutions as universities for the world, talk as though their Britishness is a historical accident. Would Summers mind if, in time, most Harvard students came from abroad? \"This question of Harvard losing its connection to America is a little like the worry that I might become anorexic or too thin as a result of my diet. It's a possibility out there, but the direction of movement from here, I think, is quite clear. Any danger is somewhat remote. </p> <p>\"My hope would be that Harvard remains an American university, but a far more international and global university, and I think the opportunity to come to America is an important part of what makes the university such a magnet to foreign students and I wouldn't want to lose that.\"</p> <p>Harvard, of course, is the university that picked up Oxford reject Laura Spence, a cause celebrated by Summers' friend Gordon Brown, and the admissions office is driving hard in the UK.</p> <p>\"Certainly there's now a global market for extraordinary faculty,\" he says. \"There's a global competition for the best PhD students and there's global competition in some other fields. At the undergraduate level, while there is much more international interchange than there was a decade or two ago, we still don't have a kind of open global market competition, and I suspect that's quite some distance off.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, Robert Reich, labour secretary in an earlier Clinton administration, warned in a speech to the Higher Education Policy Institute in London that US universities were in danger of losing their public purpose. Summers disagrees, but adds: \"I worry that we need to make sure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds come to American universities in greater numbers.\" That's where the free education for poorer families comes in, as well as his new Crimson summer academy, for talented students in schools at the unposh end of the neighbourhood. Summers, himself, ran a class on public speaking.</p> <p>While he is said to be sceptical about across-the-board \"affirmative action\", he reserves the right to promote ethnic minority and poorer students. \"You have to judge everybody in terms of what they bring to the table. I don't think it's a matter of compensating for disadvantage, I think it's a matter of judging potential.\" He uses the example of two applicants, one from a privileged background, the other from a disadvantaged home, who score the same on the scholastic aptitude test that most US students take. \"I think it's relatively clear that the student who has earned the high score without all the help is likely to have more potential than the other student.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the area where Summers shows most humility - not a word easily associated with his institution - is over Harvard's record on teaching, and the face time students get with leading academics. In the Shanghai Jiao Tong league table, Cambridge - the English one - beat Harvard for teaching quality. \"I know we need to work on our teaching,\" Summers says. Harvard, he maintains, has a good record compared with other US universities. But ask if Oxbridge has lessons for Harvard and he eventually concludes: \"I think that is somewhere where we have something to learn, yeah.\" Smaller classes are one of his curriculum review recommendations. He says his reforms \"will provide more, and substantially greater, inducement for faculty and students to spend time together, which there has been too little of, traditionally, at Harvard and other great American universities.</p> <p>\"I thought it was a terrific sign that for the first time, when I hosted the barbecue for the freshmen, there were more than 100 faculty members who came to greet the freshmen, which is something that is sort of unheard of ... The culture is changing, but it takes time.\"</p> <p>The phone's going in the adjoining office. He says he spends 10%-20% of his time talking to donors or would-be donors - some universities (among them Yale and Princeton) have a higher endowment per student. \"The reason to give to Harvard has never been need; it's always been opportunity.\"</p> <p>And there are big, big opportunities. I ask him what he's most excited about and he can't pick one thing. \"It's constructing the university of the 21st century at Allston. It's substantially increasing the size of the faculty, so we really can provide, not just the most cutting-edge education, but the most nuanced and direct education, with contact between teachers and students.</p> <p>\"It's the chance to make Boston to the sciences in the 21st century, what Florence was to the arts in the 14th and 15th. And it's the chance to do to professions like education and public health and government what universities did for professions like medicine, business and law in the first part of this century. I think that's something that, if we are successful, will reverberate around the world.\" His secretary comes in. And he is on to the next thing before I've stood up.</p> <p><strong>Admissions: 'we are asking how that person will contribute to society'</strong></p> <p>Harvard doesn't do admissions quotas. But it does have \"tips\" - biases, all other things being equal, towards some candidates. One is in favour of students from the greater Boston area. Another is in favour of the children of former students - 40% get in, a much higher acceptance rate than in general. \"The fact is that the substantial majority of the alumni/alumnae sons and daughters who apply will not be admitted,\" says William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid.</p> <p>There's no automatic bias in favour of low-income or ethnic minority students. But, he says: \"We know that someone might bring something a little bit different, might make for a richer educational environment because he or she comes from a certain background ... But in any individual case, just because that person checks a box doesn't mean he or she, regardless of ethnicity, will bring something distinctive.\"</p> <p>Every April, Harvard writes to 70,000 students who've done well in SATs. It also holds meetings in 70 cities. A fortnight ago Fitzsimmons went to Jacksonville, Charleston and Savannah.</p> <p>Admissions officers read each application and give it an overall score. If the candidate has a chance, it will go to one of 21 regional sub-committees. They in turn make recommendations to a standing committee, chaired by Fitzsimmons, of 20 to 25 senior administrators and (mostly) academics. It sits for two and a half weeks, often talking into the night. The committee votes on each application; a student wins a place on a majority. But in the final hours, they often have to squeeze the list further still. \"It's the whole world vying for that last space,\" says Fitzsimmons.</p> <p>There was a spike in UK applicants the year after the Laura Spence furore, but numbers are still small: 33 offers this year; 25 came. \"Our mandate is very simple: wherever there are great students, we're going to go after them,\" says Fitzsimmons, but he accepts most will stay closer to home.</p> <p>\"We are trying to look at the future, ask how that person will be at Harvard, and how that person perhaps will contribute to society later - impossible questions ... But when there are as many people working on admissions as we have, it is possible to come up with more informed assessments.</p> <p>\"The underpinning, of course, is academic strength: it would do no one any good to bring someone here who would struggle academically. But there are some judgment calls there.\"</p> <p><strong>Fundraising: 'people know it will have impact'</strong></p> <p>Harvard invites its alumni back for a dinner every five years. Last year it held a 25th anniversary dinner for the class of 1978. The reunion, or rather the fundraising before and after - the college is never so vulgar as to tap people at the table - raised $30m (\u00a316.5m). The class of 1950, on its 50th anniversary, handed over $50m (\u00a327.5m) - \"50 for 50\". Three-quarters of alumni give at least every five years; 45% every year.</p> <p>Harvard has a big fundraising staff: 90 for the college alone, and 620 across the university. But a lot of the asking is done by alumni themselves. The college appoints class leaders to head a committee of up to 160 people. They hold events ahead of the reunion, on the west coast, and in New York and Boston, and between them reach virtually the whole year group of 1,400 or so. It's not unknown for 80% to turn up to the dinner.</p> <p>\"The class of 79 wants to beat the class of 78,\" says Donella Rapier, vice-president for alumni affairs and development. \"A lot of people are really energised by the competition. Some people are turned off, but it's actually pretty effective.\"</p> <p>In 2003-4, Harvard raised $541m (\u00a3300m). But it is actually going through a \"quiet period\" before the launch of a major campaign in 2007 or 2008. \"You hope to have 30%, 40%, sometimes even 50% of the money raised before you publicly launch,\" says Rapier.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of things we do for alumni that we would do whether we raised money or not,\" she says. It's a \"happy by-product\" that this leads them to feel they want to \"participate financially\".</p> <p>\"They know if they make an investment at Harvard it will be managed well, spent and stewarded well, and it will have impact. People know a place like Harvard is going to last. So if they want to create something that is going to last for generations, this is a good place to do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Thanks to the efforts of a certain popular comedian, Norwich spells naff for many people who have never been there. This slur is hardly going to be put right by a meeting that took place there early this year between the local MP and a few constituents. But the results of that encounter may well earn the East Anglian city a footnote in education history in the same way that Warwick now looks like going down in trade union lore.</p> <p>It was at this meeting that the education secretary, and Norwich South MP, Charles Clarke, listened to some uncomfortable facts about the need for the government to put more resources into education and training for older people. He was reportedly struck by what he was told and subsequently instructed officials at the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) to search for creative solutions to the problems.</p> <p>The submission made to Clarke by the small group from the local branch of Age Concern was three-pronged. First, they told him the upper age limit of 54 for taking out a student loan was indefensible - not a new proposition.</p> <p>Second, they told him the government's education policies, not least its skills strategy, would be vulnerable to legal challenge when the EU directive on age discrimination comes into force in this country in October 2006.</p> <p>And third, they reminded him of the demographic future. The government has no option economically but to realign an education policy so entirely focused on the young, so that older people get a fair share of resources.</p> <p>What was unspoken was that a general election was hovering over the horizon. Though the under-30s get by far the largest portion of the education and training budget, when it comes to turning out to vote they are increasingly ungrateful. Older people are much more likely to vote, and their numbers are expanding.</p> <p>On the upper age limit, it looks as though the cap may at some undetermined date be lifted. A working group of representatives from Age Concern, the NUS, universities, the Student Loans Company, student advice services and civil servants met last week to wrestle with the issue.</p> <p>The age cap was set when the Tories introduced the loan scheme and it was decided that an individual's student loan debt would be wiped out at 65, said David Harrop, Age Concern's education and training officer. \"We've argued that that is no longer necessary because, under the recent higher education act and accompanying legislation, the debt lasts 25 years. Most people pay it back in about 13 or 14 years.\"</p> <p>The working group has set another date to meet. Nothing was finalised but it seems the government might lift the cap when it has a foolproof way of avoiding exposure to big losses. DfES officials don't want another individual learning accounts-type scandal.</p> <p>Access for the 55-pluses to the loan scheme is perhaps the least of the three issues. Only about 2,000 people over 54 are at university, said Harrop, though civil servants might fear an explosion in growth if the cap were lifted.</p> <p>On the other points, there has also been movement. Two weeks ago, Niace, the National Institution for Adult and Continuing Education, staged a seminar at the DfES's behest with the aim of informing it on the government's performance since 1997 on older people's issues. A briefing paper from Niace looked at the key statements and policy directives from the past six years, assessing each on how far older people were considered.</p> <p>This told a story of reports, papers and initiatives that acknowledged the importance of learning for the over-50s. It included government statistics on age profiles on courses: in 2002-03, for instance, a quarter of those on learndirect courses were over 50; two-thirds of those involved in the Union Learning Fund were 41 to 60.</p> <p>The government said the intention to make a first level 2 qualification - five GCSEs or their equivalent - a universal entitlement would benefit older people. Despite this, an Age Concern report in January this year concluded that older people were least likely to benefit from employer-provided vocational training and education.</p> <p>A recent report by the National Audit Office concluded that although more older people had recently taken part in studying, they continued to show relatively low levels of participation in most training and education, which they need to compete more effectively in the labour market.</p> <p>A \"turning point in government realisation that trends in employment, retirement and life expectancy were unsustainable\" came in Winning the Generation Game, a 2000 report by the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit (PIU).</p> <p>This reckoned that \u00a316bn a year was lost in GDP, plus \u00a33bn-5bn from the public purse in extra benefits and lost taxes, through the absence of 2.8 million people between 50 and 65 from employment and volunteering.</p> <p>The government's recent clarification on how last year's skills strategy is to pan out shows everything is even more skewed to the 16-30 age group - even the level 2 entitlement, said Patrick Gratton of the Third Age Employment Network: \"The current pattern of training and qualifications bears little relationship to the profile of adults without level 2 qualifications.\"</p> <p>In 2002-03, of the 247,000 working-age adults who got a level 2 qualification, just 42,000 (17%) were over 40. Of the estimated 6 million adults without a level 2.4m (66%) are over 40.</p> <p>What is likely to bring about change is demography, and any government pleas that people should defer taking up a state pension and work until 70. Then, runs one argument, an age group which is the most underskilled will expect as much support as the under-30s, if not more.</p> <p>So, what will the DfES do? First, it will use the material it is gathering from Niace et al to feed into a wider government review led by the Department of Work and Pensions. That is due to report to the cabinet sub-committee on older people in the new year. Until now, this group has apparently met rarely. That might change.</p>",
  "<p>A judge in Milan will today begin the first criminal proceedings to be triggered by the Parmalat scandal when he opens a hearing to decide on calls for the indictment of 32 individuals and institutions including the group's founder and former chairman, Calisto Tanzi.</p> <p>The global food conglomerate's devastating \u20ac14bn (\u00a39.65bn) implosion at the end of last year was the result of one of the world's largest financial deceptions. A vast network of offshore subsidiaries covered up debts eventually totalling eight times those shown on Parmalat's balance sheet.</p> <p>The scandal raised fears about corporate governance in Europe comparable to the worries prompted by the failure of Enron in the United States. It also revived speculation that investors in Italian companies courted special risks.</p> <p>So great is the interest in the proceedings that they are to be relayed to screens outside the court. Tens of thousands of Italian bond and shareholders saw the value of their investments slashed by Parmalat's near-collapse.</p> <p>Prosecutors will strive to convince the judge that they have a solid case against Mr Tanzi and 28 other Parmalat directors, executives and advisers. They are also seeking the arraignment of the Italian units of the firm's accountants, Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton, and the Italian subsidiary of Bank of America, which was closely involved in Parmalat's financing.</p> <p>Bank of America, Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton's former Italian unit have all denied wrongdoing.</p> <p>In separate civil actions, the company's administrator, Enrico Bondi, is trying to get back cash from international institutions he blames for underpinning the group's fantasy accounting. Several banks helped with - and profited from - a stream of bond issues that kept Parmalat afloat until last December.</p> <p>The hearing that begins today is expected to last several months. The accused have been charged with a variety of financial offences including market manipulation.</p> <p>Among those at risk of indictment is Fausto Tonna, Parmalat's former chief financial officer. In an interview at the weekend, he strove to heap the blame for the company's downfall on to its founder.</p> <p>He painted a picture of a chairman who simply ignored repeated shortfalls between predicted and actual earnings.</p> <p>\"For a decade, we went on drawing up budgets [on the basis of] forecast growth of 35 to 40% when sales were way below that,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Lots of times, I warned the boss, but he would shrug. That's how he behaved when faced with bad news.\"</p> <p>The former CFO also accused Mr Tanzi of keeping on incompetent executives despite their failure to meet the profit targets on which Parmalat's spending was based. His own department was \"forced by Calisto Tanzi to cover [the] losses,\" he added.</p> <p>In separate actions, Parmalat's new managers are suing Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton for $10bn (\u00a35.5bn) and seeking a further $10bn from banks including Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston.</p> <p>But financial institutions affected by the scandal have claimed they too were fooled by the vast fraud perpetrated at Parmalat. It came to light last December when Bank of America denied it was holding \u20ac4bn which the group claimed to have deposited with it.</p> <p>Today's hearing opens against a background of reports that prosecutors in Parma, near where the company is based, are investigating claims it paid \u20ac2m a year to political parties. The newspaper La Repubblica said at the weekend that it was not yet clear if the donations had been declared.</p>",
  "<p>A billionaire is hardly ever mistaken for an innocent abroad but you have to wonder if Malcolm Glazer understands just what he is getting into. </p> <p>The septuagenarian seems set to attempt a takeover of Manchester United. He must be one of the few men left who believe there are riches to be had in British football. It might look as if a fortune awaits, but others who mounted a raid discovered that the vault was booby-trapped. </p> <p>The pioneer was Irving Scholar, who took the revolutionary step of floating Spurs on the Stock Exchange in 1983. Though his intentions can still spark argument, there is no doubting the financial troubles that ensued when the club diversified beyond its area of competence by moving, for example, into sportswear and ticketing businesses. </p> <p>In the decades since then many supporters have learned far more than they ever wished to know about company law, becoming woebegone experts in administration and bankruptcy. </p> <p>The magnates who continue to be involved in the sport fall into two categories. The first, and largest of them, includes the likes of Mohamed al Fayed, at Fulham, who have lately developed a keen interest in economising. The other group is made up of those who just don't care what the price is, and it occasionally looks as if Roman Abramovich is the only name on the membership list. </p> <p>Glazer, JP McManus and John Magnier are, of course, correct in thinking that Manchester United are the exception in what is whimsically called the football industry. They have shown the commercial acumen to make the most of a worldwide following. So effective has the club been that it has been able to keep on buying players while also paying dividends. </p> <p>The acquisition of United, however, could make sense to Glazer only if it leapt to undreamt of peaks of profitability. Magnier and McManus seem to have been waiting merely for someone like the American to bid for their holding. There has never been any indication that either of them wished to run Old Trafford's day-to-day operation themselves. </p> <p>Glazer prospered mightily after snapping up the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the risks involved in adding United to the portfolio are intimidating. His 19.2% stake cost him \u00a3140m and the entire club was being valued at \u00a3800m yesterday. For Glazer to recoup his outlay and enjoy the sort of return that would justify the venture, United would have to be forced into radical changes that must antagonise supporters. </p> <p>The annual accounts announced last week showed pre-tax profits falling by 30% to \u00a327.9m and next year's figures, with the \u00a327m Wayne Rooney signing hitting the balance sheet, will be subdued as well. Glazer, or any other bidder, could transform the situation in seasons ahead only by slashing costs and boosting revenue. Such a policy would run contrary to the interests of Sir Alex Ferguson, who has to compete for players with rivals such as Chelsea, as well as those of fans who currently enjoy reasonable ticket prices at Old Trafford. </p> <p>The latter group may be spectators at weekends but they will not be on the sidelines if Glazer continues with his approach. This club has intelligent and savvy followers who know how to fight unwanted entrepreneurs. The Shareholders United body, for example, arose in the successful campaign to fend off Rupert Murdoch's 1998 bid. His move was blocked by the DTI, which feared that BSkyB would otherwise be ensured an unhealthy dominance in the television market. </p> <p>There is no such barrier for Glazer to surmount, but there will be suffering ahead for him if hostility hardens in the north-west. Despite their varied activities, match-day revenue at the 67,000-seat Old Trafford continues to be crucial to United and any boycott would have a savage effect. These spectators prize their share certificates but few mistake an emotional investment for a monetary asset. </p> <p>The plc status of many football clubs is the aftermath of a misadventure. There is no logic to the model when customers (fans) are opposed to profit unless the bulk of it is plunged back into improving the ground or, above all, the team. Anyone who attempts to make off with a pile of loot will be hounded and those few who have got away with a stash are reviled. </p> <p>Glazer would have to convince supporters that his scheme is good for the club and he will surely fail to do so. If the American does proceed with his venture he will be ensuring a brutal struggle between commerce and people's emotional investment in the game. Should fans get their way, United will be seen primarily as a football club who just happen to be pretty good at business as well.</p>",
  "<p>Nine years ago Malcolm Glazer paid $192m for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Having previously failed with a bid to buy the New England Patriots, he seemed to many observers an over-eager shopper paying a ridiculous sum for a team who were the laughing stock of the NFL. </p> <p>The Bucs' standing was summed up by the story of how the new owner used to walk through the car park soon after kick-off to watch touts desperately trying to flog tickets at half price. \"We overpaid by maybe $50m, yes we did,\" he admitted later. \"We were competing with other people who were going to take this team directly to Baltimore.\" </p> <p>That Forbes magazine recently valued the Bucs at almost $800m may explain why Glazer now serves on the NFL's finance committee. </p> <p>Once he took over, Glazer raised ticket prices by 10% at the start of his first two seasons, changed the team jersey from disgusting orange to a more palatable pewter-and-red, and promised to keep the Bucs in Tampa for two years until a new stadium could be sorted out (US sport franchises move between cities with a regularity that would appal British football fans). </p> <p>He then offered to put up half the money for the new facility if the Tampa community would come up with the rest. When that idea ran into problems, however, he threatened to up sticks and was seen scouting possible new sites 3,000 miles west, in Los Angeles. </p> <p>Although some would call that holding a city to ransom, the mere threat of departure was sufficient to get local politicians worried. They duly endorsed a tax increase to finance a new $168m facility that did not cost Glazer a cent. </p> <p>Raymond James Stadium is now worth half a billion dollars to him, but there were teething problems at the new place. Some of the Buccaneers' long-time season ticket-holders sued the club alleging that they had been given inferior seats after moving from the old venue. The prime spots they once enjoyed had been awarded instead to VIPs and local politicians. Amid sordid allegations of battery, extortion and intimidation, the suit was settled out of court in 2000. </p> <p>While all this was going on, the team were constantly improving. The Glazers - Malcolm's sons Bryan, Edward and Joel are executives of the company - had taken a significant and progressive step by hiring Tony Dungy as head coach. A promising assistant who had missed out on a few top jobs in the NFL because of the colour of his skin, Dungy quickly turned the Bucs into annual play-off contenders. </p> <p>When it seemed that he could not quite bring the team to the next level and deliver a championship, though, Glazer displayed the sort of ruthlessness that marked his successes in other businesses. </p> <p>\"It has been a privilege to work with not only Tony Dungy the coach but Tony Dungy the man,\" he said as he fired a coach who had taken the once hapless Bucs to the play-offs four years out of the previous five. \"This has been a most difficult decision. Tony has done great things for our football team and our community.\" </p> <p>After the legendary Bill Parcells, Glazer's first choice for an upgrade, embarrassingly pulled out of a deal at the last minute, the Bucs became a standing joke in the NFL, and that was when they essentially gambled the future of the franchise. The decision to fork out an unprecedented $8m-plus and four draft picks in order to secure the release of Jon Gruden by the Oakland Raiders was a bold one. </p> <p>Many felt Glazer overpaid for the services of the league's best young coach but within 12 months that criticism was moot as the man nicknamed Chucky delivered the Vince Lombardi trophy at Super Bowl XXXVII in January 2003. \"We've got the greatest coach in the whole world,\" said Glazer at the homecoming the following night. \"The best fans in the whole world. The best team in the whole world.\" </p> <p>Which was all true, at least for a few months. The problem is that the Bucs have been on a downward spiral ever since, and last year it was rumoured that Glazer was interested in selling up to finance the $450m purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball club. Some reckoned a new stadium in LA was part of the attraction. </p> <p>The long-serving general manager Rich McKay - whose nine-year stint coincided with the franchise's growth - left for Atlanta last December as the relationship between him and Gruden became unworkable. His replacement, Bruce Allen, is already being blamed by fans for the winless start to this campaign and a series of off-season moves that cost the club the best veteran players. </p> <p>Glazer has kept a low profile through all of this, although he and his sons were spotted on the field before the game in Oakland a week ago last Sunday. Unlike a lot of owners in US sport, he genuinely appears to prefer the background to the spotlight, however. Which may explain why, when receiving the NFC trophy on behalf of the team in January 2003, he was introduced as \"Marcus Glazer\". Nobody is likely to make that mistake again.</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Glazer, believed to be behind a preliminary approach to take control of Manchester United, is currently presiding over one of the worst teams in American football. </p> <p>The American, whose personal wealth is estimated at $1bn (\u00a3560m), already owns 19% of shares in Manchester United plc but the club's fans, who are planning to protest against the potential takeover, will be horrified by recent events in Tampa Bay. </p> <p>Less than two years after winning the Super Bowl, Glazer's Tampa Bay Buccaneers have lost their first four games of the present NFL season and their hopes of returning to the play-offs have been dashed. </p> <p>Worse still, their last two defeats have been inflicted on them by teams with former Bucs players who left because Glazer refused to pay them what they felt they were worth. </p> <p>When John Lynch, a key member of the Super Bowl-winning side, was introduced as a Denver Bronco at Raymond James Stadium on Sunday afternoon, the Tampa fans cheered wildly. Last March he had been released by the Buccaneers after 11 years in order to make room in their salary limit. </p> <p>Although he wanted to finish his career in Tampa where the fans regarded him as the cornerstone of the franchise, the management felt that, at 33, he no longer deserved to be paid $5m per season. Lynch has starred for the Broncos so far in this campaign, and supporters now regard his departure as a serious error of judgment by the club. </p> <p>A week earlier, the Buccaneers suffered at the hands of another high-profile casualty of cost-cutting. The controversial defensive tackle Warren Sapp marked his first game against his old team by saving a touchdown with a crucial tackle and contributing prominently to the Oakland Raiders' 30-6 victory. His departure from Tampa as a free agent last March was less lamented than Lynch's but the reason was the same: to cut back on salary. </p> <p>As the team lurches from one disaster to the next, it does so without the highly rated wide receiver Keenan McCardell. He has refused to train or play so far this season as he waits for the Buccaneers to almost double his salary to $4m per year, the going rate for a receiver of his calibre. </p> <p>Penny-pinching at the cost of on-field success - hardly the sort of reputation the Glazers want to bring with them to Manchester.</p>",
  "<p>The fuse that sparks Fulham's seemingly inevitable self-destruction ran even shorter last night, and Selhurst Park exploded in joy. </p> <p>It took Palace eight months of their previous Premiership season to register a first home win; this time they managed it in eight matches. Benefiting from Fulham's fourth dismissal of the season, Iain Dowie's team recorded a victory that lifted them off the bottom. </p> <p>Dowie's strategy for damage limitation has its limitations. A 4-5-1 formation asks a lot of a 5ft 7in striker such as Andy Johnson, whose undeniable talents do not lie in holding up the ball. He is more of a gadfly to Premiership defences. </p> <p>That quality invited Ian Pearce's clumsy attempt to swat the striker when he was clean through, however, and the referee had no choice but to reduce Fulham to 10 men after six minutes. </p> <p>\"If you're lumping balls up to Andy it's a waste of time,\" said Palace's assistant manager Kit Symons. \"But we were playing through the midfield and putting quality balls through. His work rate is phenomenal, as good as any in the division.\" </p> <p>The sending off should have allowed Palace to suck the life out of their visitors by keeping careful possession, but Fulham were content to sit back and draw their sting. </p> <p>Wayne Routledge, Johnson and Aki Riihilahti all sent close-range headers wide and it seemed that Palace would never be rewarded for their industry. Edwin van der Sar then comfortably saved Emmerson Boyce's long-range effort. </p> <p>Steed Malbranque drew a superb save from Gabor Kiraly with a shot from 20 yards but it was Fulham's only presentable first-half effort. Circumstances would force them to reconsider their ambition soon after the interval, however. </p> <p>Ben Watson slipped the ball through to Riihilahti, who lifted the ball over Alain Goma for the onrushing Johnson to side-foot a well-constructed goal. \"He took it very, very well,\" Symons said. </p> <p>Routledge soon worked his way behind the defence and delivered a cross which eluded Van der Sar and, had Moritz Volz not intervened, Joonas Kolkka would have tapped into an empty net. </p> <p>Fulham then seemed to regain the upper hand as first Malbranque had a chance from distance, then Luis Boa Morte cut in for a shot which Kiraly had little trouble gathering. </p> <p>The familiar territory of a corner, Palace's eighth, allowed the home side to extend their lead, though. Routledge delivered from the right and Riihilahti rose well from near the penalty spot, hammering a header home despite Volz's attempt to clear. </p> <p>There might have been more if a penalty had been awarded for Boa Morte's rough tackle on Johnson. Or if the striker had picked out Kolkka rather than shooting wide when one-on-one with the keeper, or if Ivan Kaviedes had not hit a post with a late shot. </p> <p>\"I got a great reception from the fans because I had four great years here,\" said Chris Coleman, the Fulham manager, \"but I knew they were bottom of the league and there was no sentiment. I'm bitterly disappointed to come and lose to the bottom team. We lost 2-0 and it could have been four.\" Palace will settle for that and the three points.</p>"
