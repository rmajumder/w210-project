  "Professor Harold Perkin, who has died aged 78, was an important and innovative scholar, whose pioneering publications and vigorous entrepreneurship helped establish social history as a major area of study in British universities and in the broader public mind. As championed and practised by Perkin, social history was neither the mindless accumulation of antiquarian trivia, nor the nostalgic celebration of some imagined bucolic past, and least of all was it the arrangement of the facts in accordance with some preordained (and usually Marxist) pattern. For Perkin, social history was the history of society as a whole: its people and places, its structures and institutions, and its evolution and development over time. <p>He was born at Hanley in the Potteries, in a two-up, two-down terraced cottage, and he was deeply influenced by his boyhood background. His father was a builder, but Perkin's extended family spread widely across the social scale, ranging from poor, unskilled labourers to the wealthy owners of pottery factories. Hence, in later life, his fascination with the complex gradations of English society, his distrust of Marxist attempts to fit the variegated working class into one uniform, coherent and class-conscious proletariat, and also his own (perhaps excessive?) sensitivity to what he regarded as middle-class condescension and establishment aloofness. </p> <p>From Hanley high school, Perkin won a history scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he began his studies in the autumn of 1945. He found the curriculum narrow and restrictive, but he graduated with a starred first in the summer of 1948, and, soon after, he married Joan Griffiths, who also came from the Potteries. Their marriage was extremely happy, and late in life Joan, who had worked in local government, became a much-published social historian, to her husband's great pride and delight. </p> <p>After two years' national service in the RAF, where he learned more about social inequality, Perkin planned to return to Cambridge, intending to obtain a PhD before beginning an academic career. But despite his excellent degree, his college refused to take him back, and this rebuff rankled all his life. Yet as he himself came to see, this was, in fact, the making of him. Instead of becoming a graduate student, focusing on some narrow piece of archive-based research, Perkin became a staff tutor in the extra-mural department at Manchester University, and subsequently a lecturer in the history department, in what was then the novel subject of social history. </p> <p>This, in turn, meant he was both forced and encouraged to think and write about the recent English past more synoptically and panoramically than he might otherwise have done; and he soon began to contemplate a large-scale history of the evolution of English society (it was always England, rather than Britain, about which he wrote) from the early 18th century until the present day. </p> <p>The first fruits of these labours were The Origins Of Modern English Society, 1780-1880, published in 1969. It was an audacious, groundbreaking book, which charted and explained the nation's evolution from a landed, individualistic hierarchy to a class-based urban society. In so doing, Perkin put social change at the centre of the historical stage, but he also connected it with economic development, political activity and patterns of thought. </p> <p>As such, it was indeed the total history of society that he had long advocated. It made his academic reputation, and it also reached a wide public audience. With the passage of time, the book has inevitably dated, but many of its concepts and phrases - \"the abdication on the part of the governors\", \"the triumph of the entrepreneurial ideal\", \"a viable class society\" - have passed into common currency, and, more than 30 years on, it remains an unsurpassed classic of its kind. </p> <p>By this time, Perkin had been translated to the new University of Lancaster, where, in 1976, he held the first professorship of social history in the country, and where his career belatedly blossomed. He edited a series of books, Studies In Social History, for Routledge; he founded and became chairman of the Social History Society (1976-85); he was president of the Association of University Teachers, and wrote their history, Key Profession (1969); and he presented two major television series for Granada, which eventually appeared as The Age Of The Railway (1970), and The Age Of The Automobile (1976). </p> <p>But his main concern during these years was with the second instalment of his social history, which eventually appeared as The Rise of Professional Society: England Since 1880, in 1989. By then, Perkin had become increasingly disenchanted with Thatcherite England, and with (as he saw it) the prime minister's aggressively philistine attitude towards universities. In 1985, he left Lancaster, and joined the brain drain, taking up a professorship at Northwestern University in Chicago. </p> <p>Like many historians of England who head west, his intellectual horizons expanded, and he began to think of England's recent social past in a broader, international and comparative framework. The eventual result was The Third Revolution: Professional Elites In The Modern World (1996), which examined the leading professional societies of the western world since the second world war. </p> <p>A year later, he retired from Northwestern, and he and Joan returned to Britain, settling in London, where both of them became regular and much-valued visitors to the Institute of Historical Research. In 2002, Perkin published his final book: it was his autobiography, and it was appropriately entitled The Making Of A Social Historian. It recorded a remarkable life - of striving, of self-help, and of upward social mobility, as he participated in some of those very historical trends and developments which he had charted and described in his own books. </p> <p>He remained to the end lively, cheerful and alert, and secure in the knowledge that, with Asa Briggs and Eric Hobsbawm, he had transformed our understanding of England's recent social past. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, and their son and daughter. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Harold James Perkin, historian, born November 11 1926; died October 16 2004</p>",
  "<p>When the Rugby Football League's executive chairman Richard Lewis was persuaded to take tonight's Gillette Tri-Nations match between Australia and New Zealand to London rather than Warrington, the last thing he expected was to be warning spectators to arrive at Loftus Road early to prevent congestion in the streets of Shepherd's Bush. </p> <p>Yet the game is on course for a 16,500 sell-out and the major drawcard is the game's bright young hope, New Zealand's 19-year-old loose forward Sonny Bill Williams. </p> <p>Williams was impressive in the Kiwis' 16-all draw with Australia in the first game of the Tri-Nations in Auckland last weekend but it will be a surprise if they can deny Australia tonight. They have lost three key players, the wing Matt Utai and second-row pair Tony Puletua and Joe Galuvao, all summoned back to their clubs. Australia make two changes, with Craig Fitzgibbon returning from injury and Shaun Timmins preferred to Andrew Ryan on the bench. </p> <p><strong> TV: Sky Sports 1, 6pm</strong><br></p>",
  "Over the last decade the supporters of Cardiff City have gained a fearsome reputation, more of their fans are subject to banning orders than any other club in England and Wales. <p>In the last three seasons however the club, South Wales police and supporters' groups have set about changing things, and the latest arrest figures suggest their efforts are working. </p> <p>Arrests at Cardiff matches last season were down 22%, from 152 to 118, exceeding the national average decline of 10%. </p> <p>Simon Insole, a football intelligence and liaison officer who knows the infamous Cardiff fans better than anyone, said: \"There's no doubt that three or four years ago Cardiff City was a very dangerous place to come and watch football. </p> <p>\"Now though, I would say it is one of the safest. We regularly get letters from people saying 'I was dreading coming to Cardiff, but I now I don't know what the fuss was about'.\" </p> <p>The secret to changing attitudes, says Mr Insole, is communication. \"We realised here that we had a very serious problem and we had to do something. We played Bristol City in December 2002, and there were 2,500 people outside the ground looking for trouble. That's far too many. </p> <p>\"What we did was to get in touch with the club and supporters groups and start listening to the fans about how we could do things better. They were really helpful about things we hadn't thought of. </p> <p>\"We used to set up filter cordons to allow ordinary fans to get to their cars, but stop troublemakers getting to visiting fans. What happened was that the law-abiding fans thought we were stopping them getting to their cars, and that caused resentment. </p> <p>\"Those little things make the ordinary fans feel that they're not tarred with the same brush as the troublemakers, and makes our job easier to do.\" </p> <p>Mr Insole visits every force that polices Cardiff City away from home in the week before a game to brief them, as well as keeping in contact with supporters. </p> <p>\"Our fans are not angels, but it helps if people understand our area. This is a strong working class area, and they will look after each other.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho took an oblique sideswipe at the buying policy of his predecessor yesterday, saying that the club will do more research before they enter the transfer market in future following Adrian Mutu's dramatic fall from grace. </p> <p>Mourinho said that Chelsea had made a mistake in signing the Romanian striker, bought by Claudio Ranieri from Parma for \u00a315.8m last year. </p> <p>The 25-year-old is facing a lengthy ban after testing positive for cocaine and claimed he came close to hitting Mourinho a few weeks ago as their relationship turned sour. </p> <p>Mourinho said: \"Mutu was here before me, so it was not my mistake, but even for the people who bought him, in football two plus two is sometimes not four. When you spend big money with the players you cannot bet. You don't know if they will enjoy it, if the family will adapt or if his family situation is good. </p> <p>\"But you have to try to know. You must be sure about what you are buying. You cannot follow them 16 hours a day but you can tell in training. When you see them committed and strong, for sure his life outside football is good. But when a player is tired, finding it hard to concentrate and with a change of humour that sees him happy one day and another quiet and lonely, this is when you put a question mark against him.\" </p> <p>Mourinho, who was reported to have asked for Mutu to be tested in the first place, said football has a responsibility to clamp down on both recreational and performance-enhancing drug use. \"When people in society see top sports people involved in social drugs, it's a very bad message to the world and all our kids. I am always a defender of the control, fight and punishment against it.\" </p> <p>Chelsea will give the Dutch winger Arjen Robben his debut at home to Blackburn today after three months out with an ankle injury. </p> <p>The Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd yesterday sought to draw a line under the Craig Bellamy-Graeme Souness fall-out and confirmed the player would not be put up for sale. </p> <p>There were suggestions that the situation between Souness and Bellamy was irreconcilable and that Bellamy would be offloaded in the transfer window but Shepherd said Bellamy's public apology on Thursday had been accepted by Souness as sincere. </p> <p>\"The only person who can make Craig Bellamy leave Newcastle United is Craig Bellamy himself,\" said Shepherd. </p> <p>\"I think in him we have a great player and we want him to stay with us. But he probably went over the line with what has happened this week and he has done the right thing in apologising to the manager.\" </p> <p>Shepherd's benevolent attitude to Bellamy contrasts with last season, when he was prepared to sell the volatile Welshman and told him so to his face. One more lapse, such as occurred at Charlton last Sunday, and Shepherd may change his mind again. </p> <p>Laurent Robert seems to have heeded a warning by Souness that Newcastle's players must generate headlines only with their performances on the pitch. </p> <p>Robert has caused a stir several times with comments he has made since his arrival at St James' Park in 2001 but has promised there will be no repeat, closing his sometimes controversial website as part of the process. He wants to establish himself in Souness's first XI after starting at Panionios on Thursday. </p> <p>\"I think I played well and obeyed the manager's instructions,\" he said. \"I deserve to play against Manchester City [tomorrow] but, if I don't, I will be upset but there will be no tantrums. This is the new Laurent Robert. I closed my website and it will stay shut. I want people to see a lot more of me and hear a lot less ... The new Laurent Robert will do his talking on the pitch.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sipping orange and lemonade in the corner of his local pub, trying to ignore the baiting of his Chelsea-supporting father-in-law and questions from his wife about skirting boards in the dilapidated doctor's surgery they are renovating, Ben Thatcher rolled his eyes. It was not the first time, for there had already been the obligatory mention of David Beckham's challenges on Thatcher during the England-Wales match. But on almost every other subject - from kebab-eating Wimbledon under Joe Kinnear, to relegated Leicester City under Micky Adams, to his present employers Manchester City under Kevin Keegan - Thatcher was an enthusiast. </p> <p>At 28 there has been a sudden spike in the graph of interest in the Welsh full-back, because of the greater fixation with Beckham. Two weeks on from Old Trafford, Thatcher is already tiring of the subject. </p> <p>\"It's only because it's David Beckham that it's carried on,\" he said. \"The ball was rolled short, 50-50, both looking after ourselves - it probably happened three or four times in training yesterday. I've got no problem, we shook hands going off. I've played against him a number of times, never found him to be lairy or anything.\" </p> <p>Said, done and over. Thatcher wants to get on with the rest of his career. Tomorrow, that sees him travel to St James' Park with a City side that defeated Chelsea 1-0 last Saturday and which has conceded seven goals in nine games. That defensive meanness forced even Keegan to praise his tight defenders. Thatcher became one of them when he arrived from Leicester in the summer for \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>For Keegan, tomorrow is a fixture that will forever be a homecoming. And for Thatcher too, St James' has personal resonance and even Beckham got a mention when Thatcher explained why. Thatcher's Wimbledon (and Premiership) debut in 1996 after his transfer from Millwall was the day Beckham announced himself by scoring from the halfway line at Selhurst Park. Thatcher's next game, four breathless days later, was Alan Shearer's Newcastle home debut. </p> <p>\"Black and white shirts everywhere, that's what I remember,\" Thatcher said. \"A couple of seconds from the kick-off, [Faustino] Asprilla's put one through my legs and I've hacked him down. Keegan was the Newcastle manager at the time. He jumped up on to the pitch and was shouting and hollering. Through my legs. I thought, 'Welcome to the Premiership.' I'd had Beckham score from the halfway line on the Saturday, [Eric] Cantona taking the piss out of me. </p> <p>\"I thought, 'I can't cope with this.' A couple of minutes later Les Ferdinand's got the ball and I've clattered him too. Keegan's up off the bench again. He's jumped down my face. We 'ad words.\" </p> <p>Keegan clearly remembered Thatcher's broad Cockney eight years on. After acquainting themselves with disappointment - Thatcher at Tottenham, Keegan last season and the beginning of this - both are enjoying a small renewal. City have the third-tightest defence in the Premiership and Thatcher spoke of steadiness and Europe. </p> <p>\"We have Derek Fazackerly and Stuart Pearce and we do a lot of work on defence,\" Thatcher said. \"Richard Dunne is a very under-rated player and, since he's been questioned after that England game, David James has been on another level. It doesn't surprise me. </p> <p>\"Once we've done our defensive thing the manager will be there with the attackers. We have to do our defence work before, because it sort of goes out the window then - he's so passionate about people expressing themselves. </p> <p>\"But something is obviously working, the mood in the camp is edging upwards and the Chelsea win gave us a boost. We just feel steady.\" </p> <p>Steadiness at Manchester City. This is a club that conceded fewer goals than Bolton last season and scored more, yet finished 12 points behind their Lancashire rivals. \"Yeah, soap opera,\" Thatcher said. \"Some of the stories and rumours you hear at City are so far from the mark it's embarrassing, [concerning] the manager's supposed relationships with the players.\" </p> <p>The allegation that Keegan had lost some players was undermining him and City. Judging by the way Thatcher recalled the camaraderie in his four years at Wimbledon, the defender places emphasis on this. \"He's unique, Joe Kinnear. Training was a shambles, on a local park. We'd have egg and bacon before we went out, then we'd play keep-ball and a geezer would ride through on his bike. </p> <p>\"It was terrible but brilliant. We used to go on these horrendous trips to a navy camp near Plymouth. The lad Bruno who ran it was disgusting - he would have us out running at five in the morning. But we'd do it and then at two the next morning we'd be in the kebab shop outside the local pub. 'No way are we getting up in three hours,' we'd say, but somehow we would and we'd enjoy it. Now we have cereals and pasta. </p> <p>\"But we are doing more together [at City]: go-karting, mountaineering. The team spirit is getting better. Not too long ago people were saying the manager could go. We lost at home to Everton and it just spirals - everything is multiplied by a hundred at Man City. We had to win at Crystal Palace. Since then it's been decent, a little bit of confidence has come. We'd like to qualify for Europe to be honest.\" </p> <p>Thatcher acknowledged that kind of aspiration can lead to fantasy at City. But that he even mentioned Europe publicly is a gauge of City's and his belief. Into his 12th season since Mick McCarthy gave him a Millwall debut as a 17-year-old, Thatcher has witnessed much. He has had nine managers at five clubs and enjoyed most of it. Even Leicester last season was good, he said - \"Until La Manga. It rocked the club and it took a lot out of Micky Adams. It was frustrating for us knowing that some of the lads called forward had not left their rooms that night, knowing that nothing happened. Then the Madrid bombs came and of course they took precedence in all the forensic work that cleared the lads in the end. So it dragged on.\" </p> <p>The same could be said for Thatcher's previous three seasons, spent at Tottenham. Bought for \"\u00a34m-odd, crazy money\" by George Graham, Thatcher admitted: \"I could never say to you that I did well at Tottenham, that I was pleased. For whatever reason it never happened.\" </p> <p>A hip injury and the arrival of Glenn Hoddle are part of the explanation, though. \"Got on great with George, then Glenn Hoddle came. He brought his own players in. That's the way it goes. I responded in a way that I thought was positive and it just got me nowhere; just disheartening and I had to get out. I never disliked the man and I'd never badmouth him because I never really knew him, never got close to him. </p> <p>\"With every other manager I could say I'd met their wife, knew their wife's name, blah, blah. But I knew nothing about the man and I didn't want to know anything about the man.\" Just now, however, plenty of people want to know about Thatcher.</p>",
  "<p>At a question-and-answer session at a charity dinner in Cheshire this week Sir Alex Ferguson was asked: \"You have a gun with one bullet. Who would you shoot? Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or Victoria Beckham?\" </p> <p>Presumably with tongue lodged firmly in cheek, Ferguson thought about it for a second, then replied: \"Could I have two bullets, please?\" </p> <p>And so the sniping continues. Manchester United versus Arsenal long ago ceased to be just about the best two teams in the country. It is about Ferguson versus Wenger, the grizzled Glaswegian versus the scholarly Frenchman - like two old men arguing over the fence over who has the better lawn. </p> <p>It is an image Fleet Street loves to portray. Yet Ferguson reintroduced himself to an old friend - diplomacy - when it came to discussing tomorrow's renewal of hostilities, a match he described as \"the biggest in a decade at Old Trafford\". There were no tired insults, no thinly veiled references to disciplinary statistics, just an acceptance that Arsenal are currently the best team in the country and admiration, albeit slightly grudging, for Wenger's achievements. </p> <p>\"Ars\u00e8ne is protective of his club and I'm protective of my club but it's never an issue when we meet at coaching conventions,\" he said. \"It's a nice, relaxed atmosphere then. We have a glass of wine and lunch and we have a lot of things in common, as football people generally do. It's when you get back in your working habitat that the old habits start again. </p> <p>\"That's just natural given the length of time we have been at our clubs. We're protective, and rightly so. But deep down I admire Ars\u00e8ne. It's a difficult business we're in and you have to admire anyone who is as successful as he has been.\" </p> <p>Before anyone says it, these are not so-called \"mind games\". In a grudge match United might have the spikiness to outdo Arsenal, whereas in a contest of skill Wenger's men are undoubtedly superior. Therefore Ferguson would have more to gain by inflaming any mutual antipathy. </p> <p>It is also notable that he has finally started to refer to Arsenal's manager as \"Ars\u00e8ne\". For several years he has just used \"Wenger\". In off-the-record briefings, sometimes other words have been applied. </p> <p>How long he can keep it up is anyone's guess but for now at least Ferguson seems intent on playing down the feud. \"Your responsibility before these games is not just about the way your team performs but what you say about each other,\" he said. \"You don't want to create a tension and an atmosphere that the players can do without.\" </p> <p>That is a bit rich, perhaps, given his diatribe last weekend about Arsenal \"getting away with murder\", but Ferguson was right when he said: \"Sunday is not about the managers; it's about 22 players who are all very talented.\" </p> <p>To that effect he will be dismayed that Roy Keane has not trained all week because of a virus. To his irritation he has also had to summon Rio Ferdinand in light of the paparazzi photographs that showed him in the West End of London at 4am on Tuesday when he was on compassionate leave because of his grandmother's death. </p> <p>Ferdinand has not been fined but his eyebrows have been singed by Ferguson's invective. </p> <p>Ferdinand had been given special dispensation to miss the Champions League tie against Sparta Prague, a scoreless draw memorable for United's travelling fans imploring the team to be more adventurous. The supporters were held back in the Sparta Stadium 45 minutes after the final whistle and took to cheering sarcastically when the players finished their \"warm-down\" with some shooting practice. This season United have scored only nine times in as many league games. </p> <p>\"They have started off with a lot of problems,\" Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho said yesterday. \"But when I look at their firepower, it is amazing - much more than we have and more than Arsenal have. </p> <p>\"They can look to the future and think they can get back to where they were. But it's a crucial game. If United lose, then it is goodbye Arsenal.\" </p> <p>Not even Ferguson could argue with that sentiment, given that an Arsenal victory would not only see them extend their unbeaten Premiership run to 50 games but go 14 points clear of United. </p> <p>\"We've thrown away a 12-point lead against Arsenal in 1998 and almost did the same to Blackburn in 1994,\" he said. \"Against that we recovered a 12-point deficit on Newcastle in 1996. But, yes, it would need the biggest ever recovery.\" </p> <p>He is bullish enough to believe it is only hypothetical. \"I expect us to win because in these situations we don't let ourselves down. Arsenal will be happy with a draw and they may even come looking for one. But my experience of my football club is that when the chips are down we generally do really well.\" </p> <p>The alternative is something he does not want to think about. Victory for United, who learned last night that Ruud van Nistelrooy would not face disciplinary action for a stray elbow in Prague, would make them the first club to reach 1,000 Premiership points. </p> <p>Otherwise Wayne Rooney's 19th birthday will be remembered as the day United's title chances were effectively extinguished - a full week before the clocks had changed.</p>",
  "<p>\"It's a big game for us,\" Robert Pires said yesterday, flashing that musketeer's grin, \"but it's a bigger one for them. It could relaunch their season. So they'll be motivated, all right.\" </p> <p>As he prepared for tomorrow's match at Old Trafford, Pires remembered the last time he and his Arsenal colleagues met a motivated Manchester United. It was last April, in the semi-final of the FA Cup at Villa Park. Pumped full of anger and adrenaline, United rolled right over their rivals. </p> <p>\"We came across a very good team who posed us a lot of problems,\" Pires continued, speaking in his native French as he prefers to do even after four years in England. \"But four days later we were due to play Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final. For us, it was difficult because we already had the Chelsea match in our heads.\" </p> <p>Five months earlier they had taken part in the Battle of Old Trafford, the volcanic goalless draw that climaxed in Martin Keown's assault on Ruud van Nistelrooy. Looking at the turbulent history between the clubs, Pires cannot guarantee that it won't happen again. </p> <p>\"Oh, sure, it'll be hot,\" he said. \"For the supporters of both sides, and for people who love football, these are very big matches. Playing at Old Trafford, in front of almost 80,000 spectators, certainly makes your heart beat faster. You really feel the heat of a match like that. For a professional, I'm telling you, it's a great pleasure. </p> <p>\"There's nothing particular between the players. It's just a rivalry between the clubs that's been going on for years, and between the two sets of supporters. But you feel the atmosphere and, if there's a contact or a bad tackle, it can turn into a war. That's normal. You have two great teams on the pitch going for the same objective, and that's it. That's football. As we say in France, it's une bonne guerre. And for me, when we play against Manchester United, it's great football.\" </p> <p>The psychological warfare between the two managers keeps the dressing room entertained. \"It amuses us. It's normal. But it's not we who start it every time. I think Mr Ferguson tries to destabilise us, and to give his players the means to knock us flying. But that's OK. It's part of the game. We accept it. But we don't take part in it. It's between Ferguson and Wenger. The fact that they're 11 points behind us will be enough to motivate them.\" </p> <p>A win or a draw tomorrow would take Arsenal to 50 consecutive league matches without defeat, but Pires is adamant the prospect imposes no additional mental burden on the players. \"The record is there. The run continues. But we don't think about it. The fans and the press may use the word invincible, but you'll never hear it from one of us. We don't feel invincible. You have to respect your opponents. </p> <p>\"We just play from match to match. For us, the record was to beat the one established by Nottingham Forest. We did that. It's over. It's important to the supporters, of course. No problem. But we just want to keep winning for as long as possible. Now, of course, the target of every side in England is to beat Arsenal.\" </p> <p>His own participation tomorrow was in doubt after Wednesday night's Champions League group match in Athens, when Arsenal twice surrendered a lead and went home with a 2-2 draw. While transferring the ball to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes during the sublime move that gave his team their second goal, Pires was hit by a late tackle and suffered a bruised ankle. </p> <p>\"I was a bit worried about it,\" he said. \"It wasn't so good in the plane after the match, but today it's OK. And it should be fine for Sunday.\" </p> <p>The result, which left Arsenal second in the group, brought both satisfaction and disappointment. \"We were happy because we came back with a draw, which isn't easy when you're playing Panathinaikos, with all that atmosphere and the excited crowd, but we were a bit disappointed because we led twice, 1-0 and 2-1, and we had the chances to increase the score. So the pleasure was mitigated.\" </p> <p>But it was Arsenal's second goal, scored by Thierry Henry, that gave the night its distinction. Nothing could have been more characteristic of the side fashioned by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger than a move that began in the home side's penalty area and ended, after four quickfire passes and bewildering movement, with the ball in their net. It had Arsenal's signature all over it. </p> <p>\"Yes, I think it was very typical,\" Pires said. \"And that's certainly Arsenal's most dangerous weapon, to win the ball very deep in defence and then move it up the field very quickly. Ashley [Cole] won possession and gave it to me, I gave it to Jos\u00e9 [Reyes], and he gave it back to Ashley, who centred for Thierry. So in four passes we covered the length of the pitch and scored.\" </p> <p>A bit like a basketball team on a fast break, covering the court in half a dozen strides? </p> <p>\"Yes, a lot like basketball. We win the ball back, and then we explode.\" </p> <p>Such fluidity is both instinctive and the result of hard work, he said. \"We've had four seasons now of playing together, so certain things have become automatic. There are affinities between the players. For instance, I combine very well with Ashley on the left wing, which is a tactic we like a lot. It's true that our attacks often concentrate on the left side, but we're working to vary our play, because when the ball is on the left, space will be opening up on the right. And it's interesting that this season quite a lot of our goals have come from the right side.\" </p> <p>The hard work was done in pre-season training. \"In Austria we worked on winning the ball in defence, moving at speed and, above all, keeping the ball on the ground as much as possible. And you see the results in the championship. It's about fluidity. The players are always moving.\" </p> <p>The infernal rhythm characteristic of this Arsenal at their peak is difficult to achieve and even more difficult to maintain over a long period, which is why their unbeaten record is so impressive. </p> <p>\"Normally it can't be done,\" Pires said, \"because the season lasts 10 months and we're fighting on so many fronts. But we managed it last season, and today we're still on a run. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger works hard to get us to perfect it, and when new young players arrive at the club, it's not so hard for them to fit into a team who're playing so well. </p> <p>\"That's the thing about Arsenal this season. Strong on the pitch, but also strong on the bench. That's important when you see young players like Cesc [Fabregas], like [Matthieu] Flamini, like Ga\u00ebl [Clichy], like [Philippe] Senderos. They're the reason I have no worries about Arsenal's future.\" </p> <p>At 30, Pires is old enough to be the team's patron. But that is a role already occupied by a younger compatriot, Patrick Vieira, whose cliff-hanging decision to opt for Arsenal over Real Madrid in the summer mirrored the one made by Pires himself in the summer of 2000. </p> <p>\"Lots of players would like to play for Real Madrid,\" he said. \"That's for sure. Other players here have had chances to go to clubs in Europe and even in England. It's something you have to think hard about. And for me, Patrick made the right decision.

  "<p>Shareholders in Marks &amp; Spencer yesterday voted overwhelmingly to accept the board's proposal for the largest tender offer made in Britain by a company for its own shares. </p> <p>In a conference centre near Wembley stadium, 99.54% voted in favour of accepting the \u00a32.3bn offer. The offer is priced in a range of 332p to 380p a share. Just under half of shareholders were represented in the vote. </p> <p>The tender offer was part of the defence plan put forward by the struggling retailer when it was fending off the failed \u00a39bn takeover attempt by Philip Green. </p> <p>The retailer's chairman, Paul Myners, who is also chairman of GMG, publisher of the Guardian, said: \"The tender will lower the company's cost of capital and improve financial and fiscal efficiency ... It will also increase the rate of growth in earnings per share.\" </p> <p>He added that the company had chosen the route of the tender offer because \"all shareholders can participate but none are compelled to do so\". </p> <p>The take-up of the tender offer and the strike price will be revealed next Tuesday. If the company does not achieve the full offer, it would look to return the balance of the \u00a32.3bn by other methods, Mr Myners said. </p> <p>Some shareholders had asked the board why, if it rejected a possible bid from Mr Green of up to 400p a share, it was proposing to buy shares at a price below this level. \"Shareholders should receive a premium for giving up control of their company. [In a tender offer] the board must be mindful not to transfer value from continuing holders to exiting holders,\" Mr Myners said. </p> <p>\"Mr Green has made a great deal of money for himself and his bankers. It is my and Stuart Rose's intention to make you, the shareholders, a great deal of money.\" </p> <p>Although there was a strong turnout of private investors, Mr Myners made a point of chastising institutional investors who failed to show. \"It is incredible that once again they do not attend a shareholder meeting even though the combined code urges them to do so,\" he said. </p> <p>Investors will get their next update on the performance of the company with the announcement of half-year figures on November 9.</p>",
  "After years of expectation, zero tolerance has finally arrived in Mexico City, promising to take on the chaos at the core of this vast metropolis: My money is on the chaos. <p>According to a new law, I and my fellow residents will now be hauled before a district judge if we shoot our guns into the sky, leave dog excrement on the street, dump furniture by the curb, or demand a tip for fire-eating at traffic lights. </p> <p>And that's just a tiny selection from the list of misdemeanours that should now, at least in theory, be punished with middling fines and up to 36 hours in jail. </p> <p>The Law of Civic Culture is one of the few identifiable consequences of the city's decision two years ago to seek help in tackling chronically high crime from former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani. </p> <p>While in the Mexican capital during the $4.3m (\u00a32.35m) consultancy, Mr Giuliani repeated his well-worn adages that cracking down on minor offences undermines an underlying culture of disrespect for the law, and so shuts down a major breeding ground of criminals. </p> <p>Could this belief be successfully adapted to a mega city in a developing country with major problems of poverty and unemployment and an apparently deep psychological attachment to its own frenetic disorder? </p> <p>Yes, the godfather of zero tolerance insisted. </p> <p>His team released 146 recommendations in August last year, all of which Mexico City's government promised to implement. </p> <p>A year later the new law, incorporating a sizeable batch of the recommendations, came into effect. </p> <p>Many here are only dimly aware that the law even exists and few notice any major impact on their lives. </p> <p>Perhaps the armies of squeegee men patrolling the city's crossroads are a little less likely to squirt detergent on your windscreen if you don't want it cleaned for the 10th time that day. </p> <p>Such unsolicited services constitute the highest profile infraction in the new law, with 363 people sanctioned in the first 10 weeks. But everything else looks pretty much the same, including the view from my third floor window in a scruffy but respectable corner of the inner city. </p> <p>The street stalls blocking the passage of pedestrians clearly couldn't care less about breaking article 25, section XIV. </p> <p>The men with red rags who are the de facto arbiters of who gets a parking space don't seem at all worried about flouting article 24, section I. </p> <p>They seem almost as carefree as the stumbling souls who relieve themselves on the trees, doubly guilty both for being drunk, and for failing to control their bladders in public. </p> <p>The policemen who regularly munch tacos at those same illegal stalls must be aware of the new law, but presumably see no reason to enforce it. </p> <p>Yet prostitutes are complaining that extortion by police, an age-old problem, has risen since the new law which gives officers increased powers to decide when selling sex on the street is a public nuisance. </p> <p>So three months into the experiment, zero tolerance Mexico City-style appears to be backfiring. </p> <p>A load of new rules to be happily broken by most, and exploited by some, can hardly have been what Mr Giuliani had in mind.</p>",
  "Helena Newton (Letters, October 21) lectures us on what marriage means \"to Christians\" and tells us, of gay couples, that \"marry they cannot\". She apparently fails to realise that British law is not based on Christian teaching, but on rules established by parliament. If she lived in a theocracy, her point might have some purpose. But she lives in a secular parliamentary democracy, where the law is entirely independent of Christian preaching and pontification - except when it chooses not to be. All that it would take to make gay marriage legal and right in Britain is a vote in parliament. <br> <b>Thomas Larque</b> <br> Chatham, Kent",
  "No one knows exactly how Iran will react to the latest European proposals for reining in its nuclear ambitions and no one should underestimate the importance of its response. Britain, France and Germany - the EU3 - did the sensible thing yesterday when they set out their stall in Vienna. Their tempting idea is that the Islamic Republic will be helped to generate nuclear power if it agrees to stop enriching uranium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons. The United States is unhappy with this strategy of inducements. But with the American presidential election imminent and the Europeans desperately conscious of the shadow of Iraq, it is right to explore every diplomatic avenue. If there is no progress, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, will pass the dossier to the security council next month to consider \"further steps\", including the possible imposition of economic sanctions. It is hard to imagine that there will be a united international response at that point. <p>Iran maintains that its nuclear programme, a symbol of modernity and national pride, is for power generation and not for military purposes. It insists too that it is open to talks, but will never give up uranium enrichment - a process which can be used to produce fuel for nuclear reactors or material for atomic bombs. This is a murky area - though the US and Britain must be aware that their record on intelligence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction will not inspire confidence that they are well informed about Iran. The studiously neutral IAEA has uncovered previously hidden activities that could well be related to a clandestine Iranian weapons programme. Crucially, though, it has found no \"smoking gun\". </p> <p>President George Bush famously included Iran in his \"axis of evil\" in the state of the union address in 2002, citing its support for the Lebanese Hizbullah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad groups, as well as its nuclear ambitions and a fundamentalist regime which began life by overthrowing the Shah and humiliating America back in 1979. But the view from Tehran looks fairly ominous these days: two of Iran's neighbours - Russia and Pakistan - are nuclear powers. Israel has a formidable if undeclared nuclear arsenal and has hinted heavily that it might launch a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, as it did against Saddam Hussein's French-built reactor in 1981. American forces are next door in Iraq and Afghanistan - hardly a recipe for studied calm among the hawks around President Ali Khamenei. You do not need a Farsi edition of Clausewitz to work out that a nuclear weapon might be a useful protection against efforts at regime change in Tehran - a thought surely reflected in Wednesday's launch of a new long-range ballistic missile. </p> <p>Looking back a year or so ago, Iran looked like the case that could prove that European policies of engagement and persuasion would succeed where American sabre-rattling failed. The EU's strategic doctrine placed heavy emphasis on \"effective multilateralism\" (without referring to Mr Bush's disastrous unilateralism). The mission was important enough to unite London, Paris and Berlin, divided over Iraq, to try their luck with Iran. But barring some last minute surprise from Tehran, they seem to have failed. Understandably enough, the world is deeply preoccupied with Iraq, but the crisis brewing next door could be extremely serious. Nothing much will happen this side of November 2, though after that - especially with a re-elected President Bush - all bets will be off. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty has already been rocked by India and Pakistan acquiring nuclear weapons. Another breach could kill it off. That means that keeping the Iranian genie inside its bottle is a matter of global importance.</p>",

  "It was the night of the auspicious launch of a range of the world's most exclusive watches. Hours after the millionaire guests finished sipping champagne and eating canapes, a team of professional thieves relieved one of London's most stylish jewellers of all its stock. <p>In a heist worthy of the Pink Panther films, the burglars entered The Watch Gallery in Chelsea, opened the combination safe, and took an estimated \u00a33m worth of designer watches, leaving in their wake little evidence of how they breached the security and alarm systems.</p> <p>Embarrassingly for the owners of the fashionable store, the theft took place on the night they launched an exhibition of Lange and Sohne watches, collectors' items that are among the world's most coveted treasures.</p> <p>The party was to celebrate the store becoming one of only four outlets in Britain for the handmade platinum and gold watches which sell for from \u00a36,000 to \u00a3100,000 each.</p> <p>Around 90 Lange and Sohne watches were taken, as well as virtually all of the shop's other stock, including Cartier, Breitling and Jaeger pieces.</p> <p>It is understood a small camera was discovered inside the store which could have been used by the gang to check that the gallery was empty before they made their move.</p> <p>\"It was a very professional job,\" said Neil Duckworth, the owner of The Watch Gallery. \"We had just had an event where we invited guests to view our new collection of Lange and Sohne watches. And after we closed the shop someone revisited us.</p> <p>\"I don't know whether they had hidden inside when we locked up, or whether they had some other means of access. They knew how to get into the safe, and cleaned us out; we have almost nothing left now.\"</p> <p>Mr Duckworth said he had just started selling the Lange and Sohne's, and the guests, all carefully picked potential buyers, were a very select group of individuals. \"Lange and Sohne are a very discreet brand, they only make a few thousand watches a year in the world. We are new stockists of the watches and the customers we invited were people that we knew well, they are certainly not just general members of the public.\"</p> <p>Made in Germany, a Lange and Sohne is considered one of the world's most collectable watches - handmade, and given a unique passport number. Yesterday at the firm's headquarters in Glashutte, directors were calculating the scale of their losses.</p> <p>\"We have had thefts before of one or two watches, we had a problem when one piece was stolen in transportation; but we have never had a theft on the scale of this one. This is a new dimension,\" said Arnd Einhorn, a spokesman for the company.</p> <p>At the only other outlet for the watches in London, staff were amazed at the scale of the theft in Chelsea. Raik Krause, of Wempe in New Bond Street, said that owning a Lange and Sohne was like owning a Rubens or a Rembrandt.</p> <p>\"Only a few people in the world have one. They are very understated watches: they are not the sort of things you will find celebrities wearing, their owners are more discreet.\" </p> <p>Scotland Yard said yesterday that detectives from Notting Hill were investigating the burglary, which took place overnight last Monday.</p> <p>Mr Duckworth said: \"The whole thing is a nightmare. I only got married two weeks ago and have just come back from honeymoon, to get cleaned out.\" He can be assured of one thing, however. Lange and Sohne will not be cancelling its contract. </p> <p>\"We are very particular about our outlets, we take a long time to choose who we want to sell the watches, it is an exclusive item and we want to protect it's exclusivity,\" said Mr Einhorn. \"Our relationship with The Watch Gallery will continue - a robbery like this is not their fault.\"</p>",

  "<p>Your report highlights the fact that the Sellafield mox plant simply does not make environmental or business sense (Sellafield's \u00a3600m nuclear fuel factory faces closure before opening, October 18). To operate it to capacity would require hundreds of shipments of dangerous plutonium fuel around Britain and internationally, risking accidents or a terrorist attack. At a cost of more than \u00a3600m, it's already a huge burden to the taxpayer. If it continues to operate, its debts will spiral.</p> <p>In 2001, Greenpeace challenged the mox go-ahead in court because state-owned BNFL could not demonstrate an economic justification for the plant and there was little evidence that potential customers would materialise. Three years later, BNFL is technically bankrupt, costs are out of control and the mox plant has not earned a penny.</p> <p>The plant should not be opened. Although there is no absolutely fail-safe way to deal with plutonium, the best step for the mox facility would be to give consideration to proposals to converting it into a plutonium immobilisation plant to turn the UK's lethal plutonium stockpiles into a waste form that can be stored and closely monitored. This would set an important precedent for plutonium disposal - and non-proliferation efforts - worldwide.<br> <strong>Jean McSorley</strong><br> Greenpeace UK</p>",
  "<p>A shareholder meeting, a rights issue, a profits warning, new banking facilities and a possible takeover bid. Most companies would struggle to cram that lot into a year. Even for Waterford Wedgwood, which has already had one rights issue in the last 12 months and sold off a big US subsidiary, that it is slightly more than just another day at the office. </p> <p>The industrial logic behind Waterford Wedgwood's plans to make an offer for Royal Doulton is straightforward. Putting Royal Doulton's products through Waterford Wedgwood's under-employed English and Irish plants will give profitability a boost. </p> <p>Waterford Wedgwood badly needs a shot in the arm. First-half profits will be below expectations and rejigging US distribution is unlikely to offset the impact of the weak dollar. </p> <p>Against that background Waterford Wedgwood chairman, Anthony O'Reilly, feels a second rights issue in less than a year is testing shareholders' patience - however compelling the industrial logic. Hence the 50% discount on the proposed \u20ac100m (\u00a370m) five for three cash call. </p> <p>If shareholders don't back the Royal Doulton call, Mr O'Reilly and his deputy chairman John Goulandris will end up holding an even bigger chunk of Waterford Wedgwood stock - they are underwriting 70% of the rights issue. </p> <p>Waterford Wedgwood insist this is not a prelude to taking the company private and Mr O'Reilly has asked the Irish takeover panel to waive the provisions to make a bid if he and Mr Goulandris end up with more than 29.99%. </p> <p>It may be needed. Though those shareholders who decide enough is enough will see their holdings diluted by the cash call, yesterday's fall in Waterford Wedgwood share price hardly smacks of enthusiasm. Last night's ratings downgrade from Standard &amp; Poor's will not improve the mood, either. </p> <p><strong>Rate expectations</strong></p> <p>Yesterday the pound was back in moderate favour on the foreign exchanges. Retail sales figures proved stronger than expected, so suddenly the currency traders decided UK interest rates may not have peaked after all - despite the news coming from the housing market. </p> <p>OK, so reports of the death of the British consumer have been exaggerated. But while analysis of the figures shows that shoppers retain a sharp eye for a bargain, yesterday's retail numbers will not have economic theorists rewriting their tomes on the influence of the housing market on the British economy. Nor will it shatter the Bank of England monetary policy committee's unity on where interest rates need to be. </p> <p>It is worth remembering that while house prices may have stopped heading for the stratosphere, mortgage rates (and therefore repayments) are hardly punitive, employment is high and real income growth is strong. Not a scenario that would see consumers heading for the hills, rather than the tills. </p> <p>That said, the MPC is unlikely to be worried if consumers take the view that the cycle of rising interest rates may have some way yet to run. Expectations of a rate rise can have the same impact as an actual increase in borrowing costs. </p> <p>Indeed, the committee might feel it is on a double winner. Expectations that borrowing costs could go up will continue to cool the housing market while the competition in the retail sector will help to keep the lid on inflation. </p> <p>All of which means the MPC is unlikely to feel the need to tighten the screws this side of the new year - to the relief not only of shoppers and retailers but also to the manufacturing sector where, as CBI director-general Digby Jones noted this week, the recovery could be blown off course by, among other factors, dearer borrowing. </p> <p><strong>Capital folly </strong></p> <p>British Energy's restructuring programme is entering the endgame. Yesterday the company delisted, closing off one possible way in which any rebel shareholders could have blocked the deal. There may be angry faces at today's meeting but fireworks seem unlikely. By the end of January, British Energy should have the deal signed, sealed and delivered and the shares relisted. </p> <p>But though British Energy, the creditors and the government have got their way, the affair is likely to leave a sour taste. The loophole through which the company has driven its delisting manoeuvre might have been closed but the Financial Services Authority, which proposed doing so this year, said yesterday more work needs to be done. </p> <p>Then again nobody could have been expected to predict the extent of the rise in energy prices since the terms of the deal were negotiated. It has rubbed salt in shareholders' wounds. At best, they will be left with 7.5% of a company with significantly improved prospects. Threats of legal action by bondholders have hardly helped to heal the divisions. </p> <p>In the short run none of this matters very much, except to the shareholders. But in the long term it is important. The affair is yet another blow to those who support the concept of equity financing for utilities and big infrastructure projects. Each time shareholders are perceived to have lost out to those prepared to lend rather than to invest, the more difficult it will become to attract risk taking capital in the future.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for this invitation: it is an honour to speak here, to this audience, at the invitation of Paddy Coulter on behalf of Reuters. I'd like to say later why Reuters bestows honour. </p> <p>The higher journalism loves to throw in a literary allusion, in order to prove that its writer is higher than journalism. The higher newsrooms owe nothing so much to Oxford as the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.</p> <p>The one I want to try on you is the character Malvolio in Twelfth Night; and his parallel with the British media.</p> <p>The name of Malvolio is adapted from the Italian - Mal: bad; volio: I want. I want bad. </p> <p>The Countess Olivia, who is Malvolio's mistress in the sense of his employer, says of him early in the play - 'Oh, you are sick of self love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless and of a free disposition is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets'. </p> <p>Taking bird bolts for cannon bullets is literally mistaking the small arrows, once used for shooting birds, for cannon balls: tasting with a distempered appetite needs no explanation. It's a good description of what we in the media usually do; because that's also what the prevailing journalistic culture prompts us to do - to magnify the uncomfortable fact that we know about a public figure or an event into an explanation, implicitly or explicitly, of the event's ramifications, or the public figures actions as a whole. </p> <p>It is synecdoche journalism. Synecdoche is that figure of speech we learned at school: the part for the whole. The part, or the fact which journalism picks out, may be right in itself (it may not): it is the use made of it, and the context in which it is placed, or the context which is not or is inadequately explained, which can give it its aspect of a cannon bullet when it should be a bird bolt, or for that matter vice versa. </p> <p>Olivia's little description of Malvolio is a brilliant encapsulation of one of the deepest springs of journalistic action. 'I want bad': I want a disaster to happen near me, with no other journalists present; I want things to go spectacularly wrong, and for someone to tell me the inside story of it to me only; I want, at least, violent personality clashes which can be presented as explanations for public policy. And when I have this nugget, which no one else has or no one else has as fast, I wish it to be a cannon ball, blasting its way into the attention of a distracted audience. </p> <p>Male voglio: it has come to be an unavoidable character trait which journalists must have when they come into journalism or which they must develop soon when they are in it. When the sunny tempered ITN newscaster Martyn Lewis began to push his idea for 'good news' coverage, he was regarded as an idiot, and it was soon forgotten, except as a foolish notion. </p> <p>This is now, often, the journalistic equivalent of that central spring which powered economic activity, as proposed by Adam Smith. Smith said it wasn't the benignity, but the 'interest', the - same word as Shakespeare puts in Olivia's mouth about Malvolio - 'self love' of the butcher, the baker or the brewer which ensured that they would produce our dinner every day. Is it the wishing for bad - a trait at least as unattractive as the self-interest and self love of the tradesman - which makes us invaluable? Which renders us the pillars of democracy we say we are and which, curiously enough, we actually are?</p> <p>Smith wrote of the economic actor that 'he generally neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. He intends only his own gain and he is, in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention'. That is a good way of describing how many, maybe most, journalists define their trade. And at least to some degree, it is inevitable. If greed can be benign, so too can wishing the bad. But it isn't enough: not nearly.</p> <p>As the clutch of memoirs by Jon Snow, Michael Buerk and Andrew Marr out this autumn attest, journalists, even rich and famous ones, tend to write about themselves as if they were a bunch of hopeless hacks lurching from one damn thing to another, driven not by a consciousness of civic duty but by a compulsion to beat the competition, or be famous, or dish the dirt on someone. </p> <p>But at the end, it turns out all right. The mistakes, downright lies, betrayals of confidences, padded expense accounts, free trips provided by public relations companies, character assassinations, editorial column vapidities, insults (especially to Liverpool), evasions, omissions, misspellings, misnamings, misattributions, indifferences, forgetfulnesses, prejudices, spites, flatteries - all come together nightly, or as it may be now hourly, into a paper of a bulletin or a programme and - with a transmutation worthy of a great magician, these base electronic impulses are turned into the gold of information essential to the citizen, of trenchant and critical comment and of democratic debate. How? It's a miracle.</p> <p>Is this what the news media are becoming? Are we now lending ourselves to the production of a written and broadcast universe composed of vast swathes of what one might call consumption journalism, with a layer of quotidian writing and broadcasting of events announced by official and corporate news releases and press conferences, with running commentaries from a regiment of columnists. In the first of what will be an annual event, the Hugo Young Memorial Lecture, given on Wednesday of this week, my colleague Philip Stephens, the chief political columnist of the FT, criticised his own columnists' trade for being 'not one these days which can claim a high reputation. Political journalism in particular is too often shoddy and partisan. Polemic has become an excuse for intellectual laziness, assertion a substitute for fact and analysis'.</p> <p>On top of this, the icing on the case, there is the level of revelatory stories based on leaks and discoveries and whistleblowing - which should be and sometimes is a particular pride of an inquiring journalism. But, actually, it's become quite hard to make well-grounded judgements about them. Many of these revelations have real value: they tell us something about a world of decisions and calculations and actions which is at least partly hidden from view and which affects our lives, or should affect our own decisions. Abu Ghraib was one such revelation, which has affected a great deal. </p> <p>But revelations aren't explanations. We can be very short on these. And if the media cast a pall over themselves by being unclear about how they know what they say they know, on what grounds with which sources, and what limits to set on their knowledge: if they don't make clear the known unknowns and even confess there are many unknown unknowns in what they are proposing - that is, if they don't have an appropriate modesty or at least a measure of accuracy about what they know they know - then the result is a general bewilderment. And perhaps a general turning away from the world of affairs. </p> <p>I want to put these general observations at the head of what I 'm saying tonight, because I think they express a particular kind of dilemma for what Andrew Marr calls 'my trade', that is, the trade of news journalism: the communication of current events to audiences and readers. And we can put the dilemma, or dilemmas, like this</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> there is a dilemma of complexity <strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> there is a dilemma of entertainment <strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> and there is a dilemma of effect</p> <p>Though we have been told over and over that the world is globalised, nevertheless it is obviously true. One of the effects of this is to add to the evident complexity of everything. Decisions are now taken increasingly against a global matrix - whether in parliaments or boardrooms or cabinet rooms or trade union conferences or the offices of NGOs. </p> <p>There never were simple explanations for current events; it is now more clearly so. In the case which dominates all of the news bulletins, it is simply not knowable whether or not the invasion of Iraq will lead to a better society in Iraq, better and more open and more prosperous societies in the Middle East and an earlier end to terrorism - or to a long, bloody and ultimately deepening chaos, perhaps leading to a state of affairs worse than that which existed before the invasion, in Iraq and in the region. There are too many imponderables. </p> <p>It is not knowable if the European Union will develop further in the direction of becoming a state power, or remain a loose confederation of free trading states with certain democratic predispositions in common. </p> <p>It is not knowable if China will, as it becomes richer and more powerful - including more militarily powerful - be an authoritarian threat in its region and the world, or develop as a peaceful and co-operative democracy. </p> <p>It is not even knowable if those leaders of democratic states - President Chirac is the latest - who go to Beijing to drum up business and be tactful about issues like human rights, the treatment of Tibet and the threats to Taiwan may actually further the democratic development of China, or confirm it in its authoritarian practices. </p> <p>Because we cannot know outcomes, we should not, if we are trying to do proper journalism - that is, a journalism which gives people facts and analysis and impressions and leaves it up to them to judge what opinions they form of these - suffuse our reportage with an implicit knowledge of the finite pattern of the events we describe, a knowledge which is often based on the assumption that it will all go badly. Male voglio. </p> <p>An exploration of complexity demands a steady and close attention to the content of events and the people who drive them, to their contexts and their limitations, to their antecedents and their influences. Increasingly, as you talk to politicians and officials and executives about how their trades and the journalism about them meet each other, they talk of parallel universes. That is, there is what they do and how they do it: and then there is the journalism about what they do and how they do it: and they exist quite separately from each other. The journalism partakes of the field of action apparently described: and some of the characters exist and some of the events are recognisable. But as a description of what really happens, it's deeply inadequate - or so say the politicians and the corporate executives and the trade union leaders and the bishops and the heads of NGOs and the generals and the top civil servants and the council leaders and the ministers and even the academics.</p> <p>Is that what they would say - those with some or a lot of power with secrets to keep and manoeuvres to hide? \"That's what they would say, wouldn't they?\" is the cover-all excuse given to us more than 40 years ago by Mandy Rice Davies? Of course one on whom the whistle has been blown will blame the whistler: but that is wearing threadbare. There is a rising tide of complaint from every side, so forcefully expressed and so variously expressed that it demands more than dismissal.</p> <p>The dilemma is this. The world is very complex. It takes a lot of understanding. We are citizens, who have the right to vote for or against governments and councils and thus need to be informed of the choices we make. But mass journalism - on TV and in mass newspapers - inform us less than they used to do. </p> <p>All of our broadcasters have cut back on the time given to news and current affairs in the mainstream channels - and though they have expanded into 24-hour news services, which are tremendously useful, the analysis and investigation and debate which is essential to being informed isn't more plentiful. Debate is often partisan shouting: analysis is often an expert on for two minutes; investigation is often putting a revelation on without a context, sometimes without adequate checking. There probably is more news: there probably is less understanding of news.</p> <p>Mass circulation papers have certainly given no more time to foreign - and to domestic - news. There are fewer correspondents abroad: more is written in offices; opinion columns, often by people who have little or no experience of reporting the fields about which they write but are hired for being 'edgy' or 'radical' or 'fearless', now crowd out reporting. Reporting itself, like the front pages of The Independent, is indistinguishable from comment: is comment. </p> <p>Thus more complexity meets less explanation. And the answer to this from journalists, or at least editors and managers, is: who wants to read or look at it? Look at what happens when we put this stuff on! Viewing falls over the cliff. Circulations fall. And indeed, what happens when you put on soaps and big brother, or tabloidise your paper and make it more opinionated and edgy: audience figures rise, and so does the circulation. There's no quick fix out of this. </p> <p>The second dilemma is entertainment. We can't say that news and entertainment live in two separate spheres any more: the line has been and is still being blurred between the two. This began happening when TV came of age, in the early sixties. One of the reasons President Kennedy is still regarded with such favour by the sixties generation which now runs things is because he was the first TV president. </p> <p>In his marvellous book, The Powers that Be, David Halberstam writes of him that 'in no way could Kennedy have been elected without television. It was that simple. He meshed politics and television with such charm and style and </p> <p>despatch that the intellectual elite of the country which might normally have regarded the cross blend with trepidation, rich as it was in the potential for demagoguery, enthusiastically applauded him (in large part because the alternative to Kennedy was Richard M Nixon). Television loved him, he and the camera were born for each other, he was the first great political superstar; as he made television bigger, it made him bigger. Everyone using everyone. The media using the President, the President using the media'. </p> <p>Kennedy made the first Faustian bargain of the TV age in politics. He brought TV in to take the place of parties and smoke filled rooms and deals and compromises among the old powers that were. And he made it for all other politicians who aspired to high office after him: he made performance on TV the standard of future politicians, whether they liked it or not. His celebrated debate with Nixon helped establish him not just as the leading politician of his age, but establish TV as the leading political arbiter of the age.</p> <p>As the TV age has gone on, we've remarked that, at least in the US, the actor as politician has become more prominent - Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger to mention only two governors of California. The politician as actor is also remarked: the mastery of TV which Tony Blair was once said to have; the inability to master it which Ian Duncan Smith displayed. Ian Duncan Smith was a kind of throwback to the pre-television age: a man elected by and popular with his party. One of the reasons why the Tories have attracted so much scorn - including from within their own party - is that they should be so foolish as to think that someone whom the Party liked but the media didn't should be elected its leader. He simply didn't produce the kind of level of TV performance that's acceptable.</p> <p>Something else is now happening. The fictionalisation of the public sphere is well advanced. West Wing is a post 9/11 version of politics practised by professionals - un-illusioned, quick witted, sardonic but never cynical, good hearted, loyal, devoted to public service. It is politics without party, where aides who know the media count for everything and senators and congressmen and governors lurch in occasionally like creatures from olden times, to be patronised and ushered out. Unconsciously, West Wing shows politics as the media have helped make it - where media have replaced parties.</p> <p>The BBC tried a pilot of its own 'West Wing' in a piece of work called 'The Deputy': it had at its centre a character so like a version of John Prescott cooked up by someone fed on the vast library of caricatures about him as to be suable. It was a hideous programme. Luckily, it didn't survive the pilot: but both the US and the British programmes showed the way in which fiction has moved in to the same arena as news: it is creating an environment, a context, a received opinion - and the fictional and the real words bounce off each other, both using stereotypes and caricatures, until the line between them may, for most people, no longer properly exist.</p> <p>The BBC more recently did a programme called 'Dirty Bomb' - about the effects on London of a bomb which released radioactive material over the City of London. It was a dramatic film showing dedicated and courageous police fire officers coping with a disaster while inadequately equipped by a government which was concerned more with bright spin than with grim reality. </p> <p>Every care was taken to make it seem as realistic as possible - down to naming the fictional Minister for London as Nicola Painswick, while the real one is called Nicholas Raynsford. The problem was not its production quality: the problem was for the audience. Had the BBC got a very large story - which was that, in the event of a serious terrorist attack, we were woefully unprepared? If so, shouldn't it have put on a two hour Panorama in the same prime time slot as the fiction film saying so - and publicising it hugely? </p> <p>The viewer, or at least this viewer, was left wondering whether he should pursue the issue as a citizen or enjoy its tension and drama as a spectator, on the same level as a Hollywood thriller. </p> <p>This was evidently not a problem for the BBC, which promoted the film as a serious bit of deeply researched public interest film while insisting on its fictional status - a sign that the most serious broadcaster in the world had lost interest in separating the two - because it had lost interest in judging the effect on its audience, who it presumably believed didn't care, or accepted that fiction could tell the truth as well as documentary. Fiction can, of course, tell some truths better than journalism can: but at the level of Anna Karenina , not at that of 'Dirty Bomb'. </p> <p>The dilemma of effects is precisely that we don't know what we're doing to the people who read and, above all, who view - though Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone, published four years ago, argued that television was the largest single cause of civic disengagement, writing that 'it is precisely those Americans most marked by their dependence on televised entertainment who were most likely to have dropped out of civic and social life - who spent less time with friends, were less involved in community organisations and were less likely to participate in public affairs'. </p> <p>Putnam made an important distinction here - between watching news TV, where viewers were more likely to be civically engaged, and watching entertainment TV. But there is less and less current affairs TV: and as we saw, that there is, is more like entertainment - as he writes, 'modern media...increasingly blur the line between the two'. As far as I am aware, no serious study has been done in this country of how far this applies to the British.</p> <p>The media broadcast and write continually on voter apathy, the collapse of parties and the disengagement of, especially, the young from politics and public life: we don't know how much we cause it: the most recent. We know that public figures complain constantly that good people aren't coming forward to take public jobs because of what they see will be pressure from the media, and fear of the media: but we don't know if this is true. If it is true it's a dramatic story: but we haven't looked into it. We know that news and current affairs play a smaller role in mainstream broadcasting than they used to: we don't know if that means that people are less interested in current events than they used to be - know less, reflect less, are less good at being citizens. </p> <p>Broadcasters know they are the most powerful show on earth - and they have apparently no interest in knowing what effect they have on the audience, as long as they keep on watching. And to keep them watching, they will - as Peter Finch's demented newscaster, Howard Beale, said in the movie Network - 'do any damn thing you want' - including dropping news and current affairs, and justifying it by reference to ratings. </p> <p>Even those who blow the whistle most now feel inadequate. Kevin Marsh, the editor of the Today programme with whom I've argued on this publicly, and who was the programme's editor during the Andrew Gilligan affair almost a year and a half ago, told the Society of Editors on Tuesday of this week that 'we (in the media) have got to a position where a free press, ostensibly underpinned </p> <p>by tried and tested principles is, at best, failing to support public institutions. At worst undermining them'. There is, said Marsh,'hypocrisy in much of the press, that wants a scalp - a result - while at the same time denying the press should be concerned about its effect on public life - or even acknowledge it had one'.</p> <p>There is much disagreement among journalists about these matters, and I'm pleased to say that some of the things I've written have caused some of that. In another lecture this week - that by Greg Dyke, the James Cameron Memorial - the former director general subjected a book I'd written, 'What the media are doing to our politics', to a sustained critique, arguing that I was entirely wrong to say that Andrew Gilligan had been mistaken in its famous story of the 29th of May last year, and that he, Dyke, had behaved with principle in refusing to retract or apologise: the BBC Board of Governors were wrong in forcing him to resign, and in grovelling to the government with an apology issued by the acting chairman after the chairman, Gavyn Davies, had resigned. This isn't the place to respond to Greg Dyke in any detail: more detail will be found in The Observer on Sunday.</p> <p>But I believe that the story, and the reaction to it and debate about it, reveal a situation which demands a different approach to that we have now. Journalism is terribly important: more important, ironically, than we have allowed. It is part of a great power, which is the media: and they make up, below the state, the greatest aggregation of power in the land. </p> <p>When Anthony Sampson published his 'Who Runs this Place\" earlier this year - a revisiting, 40 years on, from his first Anatomy of Britain - he remarked that of all the powers which had waxed and waned in the close to half century between the first book and the most recent, that which had waxed everyone else off the map was the power of the media. He wrote - 'the masters of the media are the new aristocracy, demanding and receiving homage from politicians, big businessmen and the aristocracy...columnists and broadcasters are more famous than the politicians or public figures they interview; they know they can make or break reputations and ruin political careers.' </p> <p>This is a good place to return, as I said I would, to Reuters, our hosts. Journalists' pursuit of a truth can break themselves, and indeed end their lives. Journalists die in greater numbers than they used to - in Iraq, in Chechnya, in the Balkans, in Colombia, in Africa. Often - most often - they are men and women we rarely hear of, who run up against a local boss or a mafia chieftain or a vengeful army </p> <p>or police force. Often they are casualties of war. They include Daniel Pearl, from the Wall Street Journal, two years ago. Simon Cumbers, a BBC cameraman was killed in Saudi Arabia this year: with him was Frank Gardner, the BBC Security Correspondent, who was injured. Two French journalists, Christian Chesnot of Radio France International and Georges Malbrunot of Figaro, are still held in Iraq: the Italian freelance writer Enzo Baldoni was killed. That is only a few.</p> <p>The first speaker in this series, John Simpson, has for decades shown himself to one of the great explainers of foreign events, and one of the most courageous of reporters in pursuing the facts and the truth - nearly paying for it, in Afghanistan, with his life. Reuters, which endows this lecture, has still the greatest concentration of foreign correspondents in the world: I know, from my years in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, that they have some of the bravest. My present colleagues - indeed, my present editor - often served their time before one or other of Reuters' masts: it often took guts, and not the kind of guts you get from eating too many lunches. </p> <p>Media's proudest boast, and indeed their main reason for being considered indispensable to a free society, is usually said to be to hold power to account. I think we should consider a change in that formula, to make it clearer what should be the role of media in a genuinely free society. It is to assist the people of that society to understand all kinds of powers - state, corporate, associative, cultural, foreign - so they, the people, can hold them to account through their actions, chief among which must be voting and other participation in civic life. Such a huge power must itself be understood, and held to account.</p> <p>In this we need the academy, as well as broader civil society, to be engaged. The academy and the media are often awkward together; media studies are often regarded as a not quite the thing. There may be, in academic terms, justification for this: but I think it essential that the academy extend its skills and status more decisively into the area of the media, and that the media partake of some of the independence ands rigour of the best of the academy in order to assist it develop and understand itself. </p> <p>The academy is or should be a place where independence of thought and judgement is unquestioned; and in the US, large and well funded departments and institutes within or close to universities provide an intellectual rigour to journalism, which helps keep at least some of it faithful to a discussion and illumination of public affairs far beyond what we have. In the Committee for Concerned Journalists and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, run by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, it has produced from within the profession the most serious effort to regenerate journalism I've seen, one we could do much worse than to adapt for our culture. </p> <p>US newspapers, including those people here don't read - big city papers like those in Pittsburg or Cleveland or Miami or Dallas - have a culture of explanation and investigation which our nationals have often lost. Even the relentlessly commercial networks and new digital channels are capable of probing and occasionally analytical journalism: it was CBS, after all, which broke the Abu Ghraib horror. If we cite Fox as a disgrace - and in terms of journalism it is - it has at least put before us the need to either accept that news and current affairs will now be politicised to the left and right, a trend Fox did not begin: or, as I believe better, to redefine more robustly the duties, scope and limits of a public service in news and current affairs which can aspire to give a version of the truth. </p> <p>Above all, I think of magazine journalism like that of the New Yorker, New Republic, Atlantic, NY Review of Books, Harpers, Vanity Fair, American Prospect, the Nation, the Weekly Standard and many more. The debasement of our political weeklies, once prides of the world, is shown in the absurdity that the editor of The Spectator, having published an editorial critical of Liverpool (a city about which the Spectator knows much from years of on-site reporting) is then forced to make a florid apology by the leader of the main opposition party in which he is a front bench spokesman. Serious political journalism, whatever its opinions, should be independent: especially in a magazine which insists so often on its ability to unmask New Labour lies. If it is seen to denounce one week an opinion which it has pronounced trenchantly the previous one, how to evaluate everything else? What to make of its editor's opinions - and the opinions he allows in his paper?</p> <p>We need the academy and journalism to collaborate in an examination, independent but deeply and daily engaged, of media power and effect. We need a place - more than a few committed people struggling on inadequate funds, as the brave MediaWise has done in seeking to call attention to the damaging effects media can have on ordinary people - in which research, and investigation, and information, and analysis, and discussion, and argument are all possible and are constantly being provided. We need a place dedicated to raising journalism's game by examining journalism's power within media power. We need to see what the media are doing to journalism, and how far the two can happily co-exist - and if this sounds like saying that one might blame the media for the state of journalism, that may not be as absurd as it presently sounds. We need above all to take seriously a craft and a practice which remains the first recourse for most people when they wish to understand the world beyond their own horizons: must take seriously its own protestations of freedom and democracy; must take serious its own claim to be at once above power in its ability to analyse it, and below it in its refusal to be part of it. </p> <p>There is, the media tell us, a crisis in society: a crisis of withdrawal of engagement and of trust. Implicitly and explicitly, we in the media put the responsibility for that on public figures; usually politicians. We should, in the pursuit of our own ideals, look at ourselves as actors, as well as continue to act as investigators. The development of such a centre or centres, and with it the development of a journalism which was analytical of itself as well as of other powers, would be a large contribution to the continued freedom of a society which cannot be free without free media, who wish to understand, and assist the rest of us to understand, what freedom is. So that, even as we sometimes, a regrettable tic of the trade, want bad - vogliamo male; we faciamo bene: we do good.</p>",
  "<p>I spent a good while looking at today's list of newly available games before anything even resembling a decent purchase emerged from the quagmire. After the excitement of Pro Evolution Soccer 4 last friday, this was always going to a sickly runt of a release weekend. However, there <em>are</em> a couple of stand-out titles: Evolution's latest officially licensed rally-'em-up <a href=\"http://au.playstation.com/ng/wrc_4.jhtml\">World Rally Championship 4 (PS2)</a> provides the usual sideways-skidding thrills and boasts an interesting 16 player online championship mode. And if you're in the market for a new team-based super hero action RPG then <a href=\"http://www.activision.com/en_US/game_specific/9aa8d594-00f4-462c-ae94-9725b9d82a12.html\">X-Men Legends</a> is your only option this weekend\u2026</p> <p>It boasts a great range of combat moves, nice locations, all your favourite X-Men and mutant baddies, and a compelling series of missions. Well, compelling for about four or five hours until you realise you've been playing variations on this game for the last decade, and X-Men has very few new ideas to lob at you.</p> <p>Beyond this twosome, there's the interestingly titled <a href=\"http://www.vietcong-game.com/us/purplehaze.htm\">Vietcong: Purple Haze (PC)</a>, a first-person Vietnam strategy shooter where you take on the role of Jimi Hendrix. That might not be true, but I've had my fill of 'Nam shooters, thanks, and can't be bothered to check it out. Then we have a sort of also-ran football manager face-off between Codemasters' <a href=\"http://www.codemasters.co.uk/games/?gameid=1556\">LMA Manager 2005 (PS2, Xb)</a> and EA's <a href=\"http://www.totalclubmanager.com/\">Total Club Manager 2005 (PC, Xb, PS2)</a>. Definitely more McLaren vs Bruce than Wenger vs Fergie.</p> <p>I'd also like to mention the mobile version of <a href=\"http://www.totalclubmanager.com/\">Colin McRae Rally 2005</a>, launched earlier this week by Digital Bridges. It's possibly the first ever 3D-style driving game that's actually worth playing. The handling is exciting enough to offer a little back-end slide, there's vehicle damage and turbo-pop, and cute little landscapes open up in front of your tiny car. Sometimes I don't know whether to play it or stroke the screen lovingly\u2026</p> <p>And finally, special mention must go to Trivial Pursuit Unhinged (PC), a title that perfectly sums up how most of us feel at the end of a long game when we're just trying to roll the correct number so we can get into the centre, answer the question and flee to the merciful release of bed.</p>",
  "<p>The greatest living Mahler interpreter conducting the most apocalyptic of the symphonies, with a hand-picked orchestra based upon the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, recommends itself. Recorded in Lucerne last August, Claudio Abbado's performance of the Resurrection Symphony has an astonishing combination of structural control, expressive flexibility and dramatic command. If anything, La Mer is even more startling, the performance steadily growing until it is much more than the sum of its parts.</p>",
  "<p>Reviewing a Sir Cliff Richard album is the closest most journalists ever get to ritual slaughter. And yet, his first for Decca gives short shrift to critical knives. Cliff, it transpires, had become as bored as anybody with his recent output and headed to Nashville to hook up with some whizzo writers and musicians who didn't know the 64-year-old from Adam - or Eve. The jaunt has stirred life into the old fella. The title track heaves with the repressed tension of an illicit affair. Simplicity finds Sir Cliff admitting that he loves someone \"like a loaded gun\", which gets more disturbing the more you think about it. The rest are slick songs about love and loving Him upstairs. Many of us will still prefer Marilyn Manson, but Cliff's army of fans might find this his best work in years, even if there are one or two murmurs about \"the Devil's music\".</p>",
  "<p>When you look at a tracklisting that includes the titles But Beautiful and Cheek to Cheek, you might think that Claire Martin's 10th album in 13 years is just another of those sultry standards jobs by a nice singer with a nice voice. But though this set has just as many credentials for dinner-jazz airplay as material by any of her more high-profile smoothie contemporaries, Martin has always had an instinct for fine timing and an appetite for improvisation that makes her a musician's musician.</p> <p>She also displays great taste, both in the songs she picks and in her choices of instrumentation and players. On Secret Love, the sidemen and the instrumental timbres are immense enhancements to the singer's forthright yet lustrous-toned handling of the material. Jim Mullen's guitar and Laurence Cottle's Jaco Pastorius-like electric bass are two of the most prominent, giving this album a special sound of its own - at times they almost steal the show. The title track, transforming the torchy confessionalism of Secret Love into a tricksy glide through the chord changes, turns out to provide some of the few uneasy moments. On the other hand, But Beautiful - with its humming basslines, Jim Mullen's fragile but bluesy guitar, a distant Hammond organ and Martin's exquisitely timed phrasing - is a defining account of the song. The Meaning of the Blues is unexpectedly delivered as a Latin swinger with some telling harmonia-playing from Julian Jackson. And Mullen and pianist Gareth Williams add vivacious variations to Michael Franks's soul-bluesy Jive, which showcases Martin's faultless control of rhythm.</p> <p>Ian Shaw joins her for one of the few forays into heart- on-sleeve territory, the Costello/Bacharach song God Give Me Strength, but Martin's deceptive simplicity strips it of schmaltz. Uptempo swingers like Get Happy and Cheek to Cheek celebrate her uncanny surefootedness as well as the skills of saxophonist Nigel Hitchcock and pianist Williams. Very classy indeed - and warmer, deeper and more expressive than some of her earlier recordings.</p>",
  "<p>EMI, the home of Robbie Williams, David Bowie and Coldplay, has admitted it is under investigation along with other major labels regarding illegal payments to radio stations in New York. </p> <p>The company today confirmed reports that appeared in the US press this morning that New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who has already taken on the investment banking, mutual funds and insurance sectors, was turning his attention to the music industry. </p> <p>The London-based record company confirmed today that it had received a request for information \"regarding practices in connection with the promotion of records on New York state radio stations\".</p> <p>\"We are cooperating fully with this inquiry, which is at a preliminary stage,\" it added. Mr Spitzer has served subpoenas against Universal Music Group, Sony BMG Music, EMI Group and Warner Music, according to a report in the New York Times this morning. </p> <p>\"EMI has a long-standing, strict written policy prohibiting unlawful radio promotion practices, and that policy was reaffirmed internally earlier this year.

  "<p>These days, fashion is seldom far from a cinema screen and concert stage, whether it features in the release of a big-budget Hollywood film costumed by Giorgio Armani - such as Irwin Winkler's recently released Cole Porter biopic, De-Lovely - or as a global tour fronted by a pretty pop star styled by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. But lately the London fashion scene has produced a spate of eclectic productions - collaborations between inventive artistic minds and edgy local fashion talent - that although small in scale in comparison with the blockbuster joint ventures, have brought a new energy to the performing arts. </p> <p>Take Liebeslied/My Suicides, a one-hour opera investigating the fraught dynamics of a love triangle, which is staged tonight and Saturday at London's ICA theatre. The assignment of costuming the opera came to Boudicca, the London design label operated by Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby, completely by chance. The Southwark contemporary art gallery, Union, represents the German, east London-based photographer Rut Blees Luxembourg. She was the driving force behind Liebeslied/My Suicides, which evolved from a series of urban landscape photographs she published four years ago and which are used as the opera's set backdrop. The gallery emailed Boudicca's studio proposing that they provide the clothes for the opera's tenor, mezzo and soprano. </p> <p>Music is an integral part of Boudicca's identity. Every season, its shows are set to compositions created as a response to its clothes by the experimental composer Daniel Pemberton. \"The Libertines, a bit of classical, some film soundtracks,\" says Kirkby, describing the kind of CDs that are on permanent rotation inside Boudicca's studio as he and Broach create their luxurious ready-to-wear. But opera has never been a part of the Boudicca playlist. </p> <p>Boudicca was as much of an unknown quantity to Blees Luxembourg. Though her Shoreditch live-and-work space is close by Boudicca's studio in Hackney Wick, she had never heard of the label until her gallery suggested it among a possible list of three London designers who might be right to costume the opera. Though Blees Luxembourg possesses the prerequisites qualifying her to be a hip Hoxton type - sparkling talent (her work is part of Tate Britain's permanent collection), good looks and, just like Sofia Coppola, she has a delicious wine named in her honour by her vintner father - she was a fashion novice who had never been to a catwalk show. </p> <p>Her photographs of unoccupied office blocks, kerbside gratings and urban detritus, always shot after dark using ambient light, had a synergy with Boudicca's ideas. Hunter Gatherer - Boudicca's autumn/winter 2004 collection from which ensembles were selected for the opera - was coincidentally inspired by large-scale photographs shot by the New York art photographer Gregory Crewdson, and his macabre dreamscape aesthetic is similar to that which governs Blees Luxembourg's work. \"Their work had the right amount of drama necessary for the production,\" says Blees Luxembourg of Boudicca, who are now collaborating on an experimental film project with film director Mike Figgis. </p> <p>Kinvara Balfour, author and star of the comedy of manners Dazed &amp; Abused, which closed at London's Canal Cafe theatre last night and looks set to transfer to New York next winter, credits the fashionable touch of Nicky Haslam, the interior designer, with helping make her play a success. \"He's got such a great look - one day he's wearing Abercrombie &amp; Fitch tracksuit bottoms, and the next he arrives in top-to-toe Dolce &amp; Gabbana,\" Balfour says of 60-year-old Haslam. When Dazed was first accepted at the August 2004 Edinburgh fringe festival, Balfour consid ered playing it safe and wearing Armani on stage. But she decided that Haslam, who is a veteran of Tatler's \"most invited\" list, was the man to dress the stage and cast of her play, which investigates London's hip high society life. </p> <p>Haslam masterminded the set - a stark, black-and-white bachelor pad dominated by that classic Noughties trophy, a Damien Hirst spot painting (which is a fake and painted in turns by the cast). It immortalised Dazed's world and the sleek looks he planned for the cast, though they came together on a shoe string, turned the right heads. Every night, says Balfour, she was asked about the provenance of the show-stopping stage attire she assembled on Haslam's suggestion - a clingy La Perla black dress she found at the London second-hand designer shop Sign of the Times, and which she paired with Jimmy Choo stilettos she picked up at a sample sale. </p> <p>Of course, the history of collaborations between fashion and stage has not always been smooth. In 1931, Coco Chanel signed a $1 million contract with United Artists to create costumes for the independent Hollywood studio. But she quit working for UA soon after her second production, Tonight or Never. Gloria Swanson, the film's star, arrived in Paris for her second fitting with Chanel wearing a panty girdle to conceal the early stages of a pregnancy she had to hide from prying gossip columnists. Chanel was furious that Swanson had gained weight in between fittings. Swanson, a recent divorcee, couldn't reveal her secret to Chanel - fearing that news of her having a child out of wedlock with her then lover, Michael Farmer, a playboy friend of Noel Coward, would tarnish her reputation. So instead of confessing that, she played the diva, insisting that Chanel create a bespoke panty girdle from a special rubberised material she found on her gynaecologist's examining table. \"No! Lose five pounds!\" Chanel shrieked at Swanson's proposal. Chanel eventually submitted to Swanson's demand but, to her, it was insulting. In the realm of Paris haute couture, the designer was perceived to be the star to whose vision a client always submitted. </p> <p>But there have been very many successful collaborations between legendary actors and great designers - examples being the six films that Audrey Hepburn appeared in wearing couture by Hubert de Givenchy, and Halston's work styling Liza Minnelli and dressing sexy Jacqueline Bisset for the kitsch 1978 love story, The Greek Tycoon. And then there is Giorgio Armani, who, since dressing Richard Gere for American Gigolo, has racked up dozens of costume credits on feature films. A year ago, Alberta Ferretti made her stage debut designing all the costumes worn by the principal cast for Francesco Esposito's summer 2003 production of Bizet's Carmen, which triumphantly opened Rome's refurbished opera house. </p> <p>Just released is Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Kerry Conran's sci-fi thriller. It was made on a low budget and shot in just 26 days, thanks to a time-saving special-effects process. But what has added to its huge box-office appeal in the US is not only the cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow) but also the sophisticated costumes, designed by Stella McCartney. This month's Vogue hailed her debut as a screen-costume designer, summing up the 30s-inspired tweed suit, swish trilby and chic, shawl-collared coat she made for Paltrow as \"sexy, iconic and fabulously retro\". Film critic Derek Malcolm compared Paltrow's polished cool in the film to the most ravishing woman ever to grace the big screen - Greta Garbo. A huge compliment not only to the actress, but also to the fashionista who created her clothes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Liebeslied/My Suicides, An Opera by Rut Blees Luxembourg, Alexander Garcia Duttmann and Paul Clark is on tonight and tomorrow, 7.30pm.

  "Flanked by green cricket fields where he once played and a university from which he graduated, Arvind Vaghela tries not to notice the stream of students walking past. \"I used to be like them, attending lectures and going out on the fields. But now I just hide my face,\" he said. <br> The reason for his shame is the broom in his hand. Despite a masters degree in economics from Gujarat University, the best job Vaghela, 24, could get was one done by generations of his family: roadsweeper.  \"I wanted to work in sales for a bank, but you needed to have your own vehicle. I come from a poor family, so how could I afford that? When my father died I was offered his job and I took it,\" he said. As a Dalit, or untouchable, Vaghela's story is familiar in this sprawling west Indian city. Nearly 100 of its council sanitation workers have degrees in subjects ranging from computing to law, but cannot get better jobs because they are Dalits.  Their experience is part of an increasingly heated debate in India, where the government has announced that it will consider extending public-sector job quotas for people from the lowest castes to the private sector.  Industrialists, who insist private-sector jobs and promotions are earned on merit, say that this will make businesses inefficient and uncompetitive.  Rahul Bajaj, who chairs a large motorcycle manufacturer, wrote in the Times of India that public-sector job quotas had reduced the \"effectiveness of government\" because decisions were not made on the basis of ability.  This argument leaves Ahmedabad's roadsweeping graduates unimpressed. Most say that they have had to face discrimination or exploitation in the booming private sector.  \"I got a job with a firm of accountants and then had to present my qualifications. On one school certificate it mentioned my caste.  'The next day I was told there had been a mistake ? I was not required any more,\" said Dalit sweeper Prakash Chauhan, 32, who has a degree in commerce.  Chauhan stresses he is relatively well paid, at $87 a month, and his job is secure. \"This is a job for life. But it was my father's life. Our parents had a dream that education would mean we would not have to do the jobs they did. It did not turn out that way.\"  Dalits, the lowest caste, have endured centuries of discrimination and violence because of a social order that consigns them and their descendants to jobs nobody else wants to do and a tradition that all humans are created unequal.  In rural India Dalits have been murdered for proposing to marry somebody further up the social ladder, barred from temples, forced into bonded labour and made to carry human waste from the homes of high-caste Hindus.  In the cities, where it is easier to change one's name and slip into the crowd, Dalits say economic exclusion is now the biggest issue.  The ingrained unfairness of the caste system has brought pressure for reform on human rights grounds against western firms doing business in India. Unions have written to 300 companies in Europe which outsource work to India to check that their subcontractors do not discriminate on the basis of caste.  \"There are many parallels with the situation in South Africa in the 60s, when foreign companies needed to be persuaded to address the discrimination in the system of apartheid,\" said David Haslam, the London-based chair of the Dalit Solidarity Network.  Chandra Bhan Prasad, a Dalit writer who has proposed many new affirmative action programmes in India, says businesses should look for inspiration to the United States, where firms carry out diversity audits and give contracts to firms from minority groups.  \"About a fifth of General Motors managers are African American, Hispanic or Native American. GM actually goes out of its way to recruit from these communities. The company also places $2bn of business into the minority communities. No Indian business has done the same.\"  These measures helped to create a black middle class, he says, making African Americans part of mainstream life in the US. By contrast, Prasad says, if Oprah Winfrey had been born in India she would have remained chained to poverty.  \"Here family connections and caste matter more than ability. It is still the case of who you know, not what you can do.  \"In the US you have black billionaires, industrialists, black film stars, black professors. In India university professorships are closed to us. We do not have one Dalit millionaire. There is not one Dalit newspaper editor, nor a Dalit newscaster.\"  Academics caution, however, that there is one big difference between race and Indian caste. \"No one can tell from your appearance that you are a Dalit. The same cannot be said for African Americans,\" says Shyam Babu, a research fellow at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute, a think-tank in New Delhi.  \"It is more subtle. Once you know someone's name and where they are from, most Indians can identify your caste. The basic bigotry is the same: you assume an entire ethnic group is incompetent.\"  India's lowest class targets western firms in search for fairness.",
  "The head of the world's biggest slot machine company visited Downing Street earlier this year to lobby for the relaxation of gambling laws, the US company confirmed today. <p>Thomas Baker, the chairman of International Game Technology (IGT), held talks with officials at Number 10 in March, the Nevada-based firm said.</p> <p>The billion-dollar company is the world leader in slot machine design, controlling 70% of the US market, and could make hundreds of millions of pounds from changes to gambling laws in Britain.</p> <p>Details of the meeting were revealed days after the government announced plans for a major liberalisation of gambling. </p> <p>Downing Street refused to confirm it took place. A spokesman said the government held discussions with groups from both sides of the debate. </p> <p>But Connie Fox, IGT's public relations manager, told PA News: \"The meeting took place in March at Number 10 Downing Street. We have been watching the situation over there for a long time to see how this was going to play out. </p> <p>\"I don't know exactly what was on the agenda for the meeting, but I would assume it was about relaxing the gambling laws.\" </p> <p>Julie Kirkbride, the former Tory culture spokeswoman, is demanding answers from ministers about the meeting.</p> <p>\"I am surprised this company has access at such a high level given that there is no obvious British interest in this matter,\" she told The Times. </p> <p>The government published its controversial gambling bill on Tuesday, allowing casinos to be set up across Britain. The new legislation, if approved by parliament, will allow unlimited jackpots to be played for in the largest new casinos - known as regional casinos.</p> <p>But it will also remove slot machines from other premises such as fast food shops and minicab offices, where young people and others are thought to be at risk. Government sources said there would be 6,000 fewer premises where slot machines would be licensed under the bill. </p> <p>The bill would also create a new gambling commission to supervise the business and a licensing regime responsible for approving premises away from local licensing justices. </p> <p>Critics have claimed the explosion of new casinos could lead to a rise in addiction to gambling. But ministers insist there are safeguards to protect those most at risk. There are specific offences of allowing youngsters to gamble contrary to the revised rules. </p> <p>The new commission will also be required to promote \"socially responsible gambling\" through licence conditions and a new code of practice.</p>",
  "<p>A senior Sky News executive has said he is \"shocked\" by the poor quality of candidates applying for jobs with the leading rolling news channel, saying he is disappointed by the lack of journalistic curiosity among people wanting to work for the network.</p> <p>Sky News executive editor John Ryley said the broadcaster was finding it so hard to find enough talented journalists that it was setting up its own training scheme to try to improve the quality of recruits.</p> <p>Mr Ryley added that he thought the lack of curiosity among TV journalists, many of whom he claimed expect to be fed stories and do not go looking for exclusives, was a problem for all the major UK TV news broadcasters.</p> <p>He said this lack of original journalism resulted in TV news output that was \"supine\" and \"all mush and no crackle\".</p> <p>\"I've spent quite a lot of time interviewing people today and I'm slightly shocked. Curiosity is crucial in TV journalism - in any sort of journalism. We hope to demonstrate that Sky is curious about the UK, but there are a lot of things happening that don't get reported,\" Mr Ryley told a Media Society debate on the future of TV news last night.</p> <p>\"There's a lack of originality in the journalism we do today. Too many daily TV news journalists are supine. They come to work expecting to be fed the stories. We don't break enough stories, we let other media news outlets do it for us,\" he added.</p> <p>\"This lack of original journalism gives a rather uniform feel to the content. Viewers tend to see the same story in the same order, whatever programme they are watching. This makes it easier for the government to control what's reported,\" Mr Ryley said.</p> <p>\"At Sky News we've found it quite hard to recruit talented guys and girls. It's a big problem for us,\" he added.</p> <p>\"We were so concerned about the lack of suitable recruits, we've started a training scheme that launches in two weeks' time. We're taking on six trainees from journalism courses and we hope they'll go on to be reporters, producers and programme editors.\"</p> <p>However, ITV News chief executive Clive Jones countered, saying he thought the general skill level of new recruits to TV journalism was far higher than when he moved into broadcasting from the newspaper sector in the late 70s.</p> <p>Mr Jones recalled that when he joined Yorkshire TV, after training as a print journalist with the Yorkshire Post, \"they gave us no bloody training at all\".</p> <p>He added that today most new recruits to TV news broadcasting had done a first degree and a postgraduate journalism course before entering the industry.</p> <p>\"I think there's a lot of nonsense talked about this. I think [new recruits] are better trained and far more resourceful than before,\" Mr Jones said.</p> <p>He added that ITV had just appointed a controller of training for journalists for the first time in its 50-year history.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Sky News is considering introducing a 20-second delay on raw footage of harrowing breaking stories such as last month's Beslan massacre, after a senior executive admitted the broadcaster had made mistakes in its coverage.</p> <p>The executive editor of the channel said he recognised it had showed too much footage of relatives grieving for those killed in the Beslan school massacre, in which more than 329 died, including at least 150 children.</p> <p>John Ryley said he also thought it had been a mistake to repeatedly show the hostage's video footage - released days after the hostage crisis came to its bloody end - which showed children cowering in terror in the school gym that was rigged with bombs.</p> <p>\"We don't have a 20-second [delay], but since Beslan we have started thinking about introducing it,\" Mr Ryley told a Media Society debate on the future of TV news.</p> <p>\"I think we made a couple of mistakes [in our Beslan coverage]. We lingered too long on scenes of the relatives. And when the video came out on the Tuesday, we ran it repeatedly, which was also probably a mistake,\" he added.</p> <p>Mr Ryley said that the best way to avoid such mistakes was to employ \"excellent journalists, who can take instant decisions about what to broadcast and what not to\".</p> <p>And TV news bosses were warned of the dangers of losing sight of the meaning of tragedies such as Beslan in the effort to be first with the news.</p> <p>During the Beslan siege, ITV boasted briefly in a strap on its news channel, \"ITV Exclusive: 100 dead\" after its Russian cameraman managed to get into the gym in the immediate aftermath of the bombs going off in the school.</p> <p>Five's senior programme controller, Chris Shaw, who has responsibility for the channel's news output, said he was concerned that the Beslan coverage had highlighted how \"ferocious\" the competition between Sky News, BBC News 24 and the ITV News Channel had become.</p> <p>He said the rivalry had lead to \"strap wars\" - a reference to the information bar graphics the news channels flash up on screen to reveal breaking news, often hot off an agency wire and before pictures are available.</p> <p>\"I watched a lot of Beslan coverage and I've never known the competition between the three rolling news channels to be so ferocious as it is now. It's all about speed. I think that puts intense pressure on journalists,\" Mr Shaw said.</p> <p>\"There's something a little unseemly about wanting to be first with the number of people killed. That's what's going on with these 'strap wars',\" he added.</p> <p>\"It's a dilemma for every newsroom: how are you going to be the fastest, best and most comprehensive, but at the same time dignified and moral?\" Mr Shaw said.</p> <p>ITV News chief executive Clive Jones said his outfit had used a 20-second delay on its live coverage of the Beslan massacre as the tragedy unfolded on Friday September 3.</p> <p>At lunchtime that day, ITV cleared its schedule for an extended news bulletin to more than an hour an half to provide rolling coverage from Beslan, where veteran ITV News correspondent Julian Manyon was reporting from inside the school as Russian troops fought gun battles with the hostage takers.</p> <p>He provided dramatic running commentary on the unfolding tragedy amid chaotic scenes around the school as survivors of the massacre tried to flee while the fighting continued. </p> <p>\"We were working on a 20-second [delay]. You have to start building in these devices, or you could start putting out images that you would strongly regret later,\" Mr Jones said.</p> <p>However, he added that ITV had still made mistakes in its Beslan coverage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>\"Is it world music or is it jazz?\" Every time I get caught up in one of these discussions (as I did on Lucy Duran's excellent radio programme World Routes) I'm glad I don't have to stick one of these labels at the top of the column. The blurred boundaries between genres divide only when it comes to shopping, and that's not very interesting, is it? </p> <p> <strong> Gwotet</strong> (Justin Time, \u00a314.99), by David Murray and the Gwo-Ka Masters featuring Pharoah Sanders, begins with a cracking Afrobeat rhythm section. Then there's a chant - so far, so world music. Then the horns enter, and things become less clear-cut. On the left are some unsophisticated horns - hoarse and ragged - while on the right is a super-tight section playing tricky, boppish parts. The mix of rough world beat with over-egged jazz-funk is terrific, and that's before we even get to the tenor sax solos. Sanders, who has evolved a space-funk sensibility, features on three songs, and the album works well, whether or not you want to focus on jazz virtuosity. </p> <p> <strong> Strength</strong> (Verve EP, \u00a38.99), by trumpeter Roy Hargrove's The RH Factor, feels like an interim offering; a collection of tracks from the team that made Hard Groove (Verve) last year. The best tracks are Rich Man's Welfare by Karl Denson, who plays nice tenor, and Listen Here (by the late Eddie Harris). For Fun is a remix of the earlier CD's Common Free Style. Though it's more fun without Common's lacklustre rap, the track outstays its welcome. The 10-minute \"bonus\" track Universe is a (re)mixed blessing. Featuring Hargrove's vocals and some nice studio effects, it's neither one thing nor the other. </p> <p>The Dune label has the knack of introducing new artists like a set of Matryoshka dolls: open up Jazz Jamaica All Stars and Soweto Kinch emerges. Check out Kinch's band and here comes trumpeter Abram Wilson with <strong> Jazz Warrior</strong> (Dune, \u00a313.99) - a stunning debut. Unlike Hargrove, a great trumpeter at the top of his game, Wilson is an emerging artist with room for development. But Wilson has made the better album. </p> <p>Wilson, a New Orleans-born trumpeter now living in London, has managed to tick all the contemporary boxes (rap, R&amp;B, soul, jazz vocal, funk, even bop), like a one-man MOBO awards ceremony. His approach to rap is warmer, less cerebral than Kinch's, and he can really sing, joining a lineage of singing trumpeters that goes back to Chet Baker, Charlie Shavers, Nat Gonella and Louis Armstrong. He can scat, too, a cool rekindling of the spirit of Dizzy Gillespie. </p> <p>You Wouldn't Know is an engaging soul ballad, similar to the lighter side of Cleveland Watkiss's great Victory's Happy Songbook (2001), while Dark One digs into deep Brit-funk, with clever multi-tracked backing vocals. Yet Wilson and his producer Jason Yarde have taken an \"organic\" approach to production, eschewing samples, beats and ostentatious studio effects in favour of real drums, acoustic bass, piano and horns. However varied or clever the arrangements, it always sounds like a real band playing real music. Wilson plays good, full-bodied trumpet throughout - check out Take it Forward, Pedal Herlin and the punchy title track. </p> <p>The album is good value - 14 songs in 75 minutes - and flows beautifully. Stevie Wonder's Golden Lady moves unselfconsciously into the uptempo hard bop of Monk. Dark One's hard-hitting rap leads to Inside Me, followed by the smooth soul-jazz of Supernatural. Because Wilson is comfortable with these transitions - of style, content and expression - listeners are also put at their ease. For my money, Jazz Warrior is the album of the week. Make that album of the month.</p>",

  "<p><strong>The Lavender Hill Mob</strong> is the next Ealing Studios comedy to get a Hollywood makeover, according to Variety. A top screenwriter has already been assigned and work is underway to revisit the 1951 original, which starred Alec Guinness as an unassuming bullion heist mastermind. Dean Parisot, who shot Galaxy Quest, will direct. </p> <p>Luc Besson has enlisted <strong>Madonna</strong> as lead voiceover on his upcoming family animation Arthur. The story centres on a 10-year-old boy who embarks on a magical quest to save his grandfather's house from developers. The computer-generated project will incorporate some live-action footage and is set to open in 2006. </p> <p>Besson is also producing <strong>Guy Ritchie's</strong> latest action picture Revolver which has just signed up Sopranos' star Vinnie Pastore. According to reports, Ray Liotta and Jason Statham have already been cast in the story about the adventures of a charismatic tough guy, and shooting on the picture is due to begin shortly. </p> <p>The ubiquitous <strong>Sienna Miller</strong> is in discussions to star as 1960s model and Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick.

  "Two men today appeared in court charged with the murder of the schoolgirl Danielle Beccan, who was shot as she made her way home from a funfair in Nottingham earlier this month. <p>Junior Andrews, 23, and Mark Ontonio Kelly, 20, were accused of killing the 14-year-old in the drive-by shooting. </p> <p>The two men, flanked by six security guards, appeared in the dock at Nottingham crown court. </p> <p>Wearing prison issue yellow and green overalls, they spoke only to confirm their names during the hearing, which lasted less than a minute. </p> <p>Danielle was on her way back from the city's annual Goose Fair with friends when she was shot in the stomach by a gunman in a passing car in the early hours of October 9. </p> <p>She had been only yards from her home, in the St Ann's area of the Midlands city when she was killed at around 12.30am. </p> <p>Mr Andrews, of no fixed address, and Mr Kelly, of Wilford Grove, in the Meadows area of Nottingham, were remanded back into custody following the hearing. </p> <p>No application for bail was made, and no pleas were entered to the joint charge of murder. The case was adjourned for a plea and directions hearing on January 12 next year. </p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of Nottingham residents were today expected to join a city centre demonstration against gun crime, at which a minute's silence will be held for Danielle. </p> <p>Nottingham has experienced a wave of firearms violence in recent years, with much of it blamed on drugs gangs.</p>",
  "<p>Emap is actively looking at making a bid for Scottish Radio Holdings, the second big radio deal following Capital Radio and GWR's \u00a3711m merger announcement.</p> <p>Emap, the \u00a32bn magazine, radio and TV giant that counts FHM, Kiss FM and Smash Hits TV among its brands, already owns 27.8% of SRH and is finalising plans to take full control of the Glasgow-based company.</p> <p>SRH, owner of the Clyde 1 and Forth One stations in Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively along with 29 regional newspapers, is one of the oldest commercial radio groups in Britain. Its acquisition by Emap would boost the company's ability to compete with the new Capital-GWR, which will command 40% of the radio advertising market.</p> <p>Emap has no interest in the newspaper division and there is unlikely to be a shortage of potential buyers for the disposal with Telegraph owners the Barclay Brothers, Johnston Press and Independent News &amp; Media among the likely bidders. </p> <p>But Emap will be forced to pay 930p a share or more to take control of SRH before January 16, according to takeover rules. That is the price Emap paid for the 27.8% stake in SRH it acquired in a \u00a390.5m deal with the Scottish Media Group earlier this year and it cannot buy more of SRH below that level for 12 months.</p> <p>SRH's share price was today unchanged at 922p. Even at current prices, Emap will have to shell out between \u00a3230m and \u00a3240m to buy the rest of SRH, but with any rise in that price and a premium factored in, it could be looking at a bill nearer \u00a3300m.</p> <p>City analysts say the two companies would make a good fit and that they would not have to sell off stations because there is no geographical overlap to worry the competition authorities. And the stations the two companies own, largely heritage stations in metropolitan areas, would be culturally harmonious. </p> <p>Emap's radio business is based on operating stations in big cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle. Adding SRH's Northern Irish and Scottish stations would give its Kiss and Magic brands coverage of most of the UK's conurbations.</p> <p>\"If [the deal] happened imminently it wouldn't be a surprise, it's a natural deal. But not all natural deals come off,\" said Paul Richards of Numis Securities. </p> <p>\"Geographically and culturally they are a good fit and it would create pretty much a level playing field with Capital-GWR.\"</p> <p>However, one radio expert said he believed there would be a dispute over price and that SRH would be looking for a 25% premium, something Emap might not be willing to pay.</p> <p>Anthony de Larrinaga of Societe General said the fit between Emap and SRH was good and that the divestment of the newspapers, such as the Carrick Time and Galloway Gazette, would not present any problems.</p> <p>\"Emap has been very clear in that they have conceded the principle [that they want to make the purchase], so now it's just down to price. It is down to what a sensible commercial price is and leaving both sets of shareholders happy,\" said Mr Larrinaga.</p> <p>Another City analyst said Emap would not have to make any more acquisitions after the SRH one to compete with Capital-GWR.</p> <p>\"They wouldn't necessarily have to do anything more unless they wanted to be number one, but they are not number one at the moment, but they are still more profitable,\" the analyst said.</p> <p>Emap's group communications director Miranda Acland said the company had \"no comment\" to make as did SRH.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>RAKING OVER MPS' EXPENSES</b></p> <p>The ragbag of leads in today's papers is eclipsed by a story which is - in every sense - picture-led: Prince Harry's bust-up with a paparazzo photographer outside a Piccadilly nightclub. \"HARRY POTTY,\" splashes the Sun, delightedly. But more of that below. </p> <p>The Herald Tribune, meanwhile, has a front-page picture story showing Fidel Castro tripping over and breaking an arm and a leg. \"In Washington, a state department spokesman, asked whether the US wished the Cuban leader a speedy recovery, replied: 'No.'\"</p> <p>The broadsheets devote a large amount of space to raking over the parliamentary expense claims published for the first time yesterday. MPs can claim for travel expenses to and from Westminster and the cost of running their offices and maintaining homes in their constituency. The Mail thinks it has a scoop: \"Tony Blair has claimed GBP43,000 of public money on a constituency home he bought for just GBP30,000 ... Despite earning GBP178,000 a year, he asked Commons authorities to pay for maintenance because the house doubles as an office.\"</p> <p>But most of the papers are simply outraged by the revelation that MPs earning GBP57,485 a year can claim an average of GBP118,000 on expenses. \"This is entirely legitimate,\" says the Telegraph, \"but eyebrows will be raised by how some MPs are working the system for their benefit. Barbara Follett, the Labour MP for Stevenage, who is married to a very rich man indeed, claims GBP20,333 a year to run a flat in Soho, even though her constituency is a comfortable commute to Westminster ... The problem with featherbedding MPs with allowances and fantastic pensions is that it creates a huge disincentive to getting out of politics ...

  "One of the arguments for the gambling bill (Leaders, October 20) is that investment in casinos will assist urban regeneration and help cities to attract tourists. The US experience suggests this is an illusion. Until a few years ago casinos were only allowed in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. On the back of this, Las Vegas became the world's number one urban tourist destination. But in recent years, casinos have become more widespread, particularly on river boats and in the Native-American territories. Surveys have shown that most of the punters are local, simply displacing one type of spending by another. When the social costs of gambling are taken into account, allowing casino development may be a disbenefit to communities. <br> <b>Chris Law</b> <br> Stroud, Glos <p>I bet Polly Toynbee (Comment, October 20) and your leader writers don't frequent casinos. You will find them hubs of social life, particularly for transient and immigrant communities, that are far more congenial than the wash of city-centre pubs. You cannot argue both that there is little demand - in fact casinos are full to bursting - and that liberalisation will spell social disaster. The real issue is the ratio of slot machines to card tables allowed. Blame an educational curriculum that leaves kids mathematically ignorant and unrestricted credit for problem gambling, and let card players have their venues.<br> <b>Chris Bratcher </b> London<br></p> <p>Westminster has more casinos than any other local authority. Our concern is that in the rush to change the way this industry is regulated, councils are not left without sufficient powers to stop casinos opening in areas where they are neither wanted nor needed. Responsible and properly regulated gambling has a role to play in providing entertainment in our city, but under the proposed legislation, we would only be able to turn down an application for a casino licence on strict licensing grounds. Issues like the standing of the applicant, or the management of the venue could be considered, but not the overall planning context.</p> <p>Casinos currently have no specific planning use class and are included in the same category as swimming pools and cinemas, so any building which already has a permission for that type of use could easily be transferred over to gambling and gaming. The prospect of dozens of casinos springing up in place of cinemas in the West End is one which worries us, and we are calling on the government to allow us the power to plan our city properly, by allocating a separate use class for casinos.</p> <p>The second is that organised crime rakes off as much from prostitution and the sex industry as from the casinos. It helps keep the supply of available flesh going if you're in an area which offers young women few other economic options.<br> <b>Cllr Kit Malthouse</b><br> Deputy leader, Westminster city council<br></p> <p>Surely in the 21st century, it should be left to people to choose how they spend their time and money?<br> <b>Peter Alderson</b><br> Rowlands Gill, Tyne &amp; Wear<br></p> <p>Is the government's policy on pensions at odds with its policy on gambling - or are they one and the same?<br> <b>J Huw Evans</b><br> Ipswich, Suffolk</p>",
  "<p>Walkers, the crisps giant that has come under fire for using Gary Lineker in its advertising campaigns, is hoping to pacify its critics in the healthy eating lobby with the launch of a new range of 'child-friendly' crisps with a lower salt and fat content. </p> <p>The launch of the new brand will be promoted with a major advertising campaign featuring Lineker disguised as Mr Potato Head, the Toy Story movie character.</p> <p>The company has already said it will not dropping the former England footballer from its adverts in the face of demands that junk food manufacturers stop using celebrities to endorse their products to children.</p> <p>But Walkers claims the new campaign is justified because the crisps have a lower salt and fat content than usual. </p> <p>It is not the first time Walkers has come up with a healthier crisp - its range already includes Walkers Lites - but the company said it had come up with a new campaign to \"play its part\" in tackling the child obesity crisis.</p> <p>Efforts to reform its product range to include \"healthier\" snacks was revealed in a letter seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk that Martin Glenn, the president of Walkers' parent company, PepsiCo UK &amp; Ireland, wrote to more than 500 opinion leaders a fortnight ago.</p> <p>The snack industry is under pressure because of public concern about obesity, which has forced the government to consider banning junk food adverts on television until after 9pm and introducing a \"red light\" warning label on unhealthy foods - both of which are opposed by food manufacturers.</p> <p>In his letter, sent out on the eve of the Labour party conference, Mr Glenn said PepsiCo would \"play its part\" in improving the health of the nation by introducing new products, educating consumers about diet and tackling sedentary lifestyles.</p> <p>One of the first new products will be the Mr Potato Head crisps. They will be low salt, have 30% less fat than regular crisps and will feature a likeness of a character based on Lineker and Mr Potato Head, one of the stars of the Toy Story films that Hasbro, the toy company, has licensed to PepsiCo UK.</p> <p>The new crisps will be cooked in high oleic sunflower oil, making them less fatty than regular crisps. They will come in flavours such as prawn cocktail and cheese and onion. PepsiCo has negotiated with major supermarkets to stock the crisps.</p> <p>Unlike some food companies, PepsiCo does not deny that some of its advertising is aimed at children.

  "Whitehall awarded a security clearance to the temporary secretary later arrested on suspicion of links to the Sunday Times, it was admitted by the Cabinet Office yesterday. <p>The admission that Claire Newell, 23, held a clearance which may have allowed her access to \"top secret\" files whilst apparently working for a newspaper, will be embarrassing to Sir Andrew Turnbull, the cabinet secretary. </p> <p>\"Outsourcing\" of sensitive civil service jobs has gone further than generally realised. There were 65 temps working inside the Cabinet Office at one point last July, but numbers fluctuate considerably, a spokesman said yesterday. </p> <p>Temps do not have the same employment rights and career prospects as traditional civil servants and do not figure on Whitehall head-counts. </p> <p>The Cabinet Office sought this week to claim that all information about levels of security clearances for temps was classified. </p> <p>In fact, the information is in the public domain and published on the Whitehall website of the Defence Vetting Agency. This reveals that the highest level of vetting Ms Newell could have received was the second out of four, known as security check or SC. </p> <p>The most common clearance, it involves merely an identity check; confirmation from the security services that the subject had no terrorist links; a criminal record check; and a credit agency check. </p> <p>Ms Newell's referees would have included her tutor at the London College of Communication, who would have revealed she planned to be a journalist. </p> <p>Ms Newell did an MA in journalism there before working in the Sunday Times newsroom in August 2003. </p> <p>She was arrested by Special Branch officers last month at the Cabinet Office and questioned but not charged, during slow-moving inquiries into the Sunday Times' alleged mole, who has been feeding the newspaper with documents. </p> <p>Once a temp passes the SC clearance, he or she is given a number which allows them to work in any other government department at that level. Ms Newell would have been allowed \"long-term, frequent and uncontrolled access to secret assets and occasional and controlled access to top secret material\". </p> <p>The Cabinet Office refused yesterday to admit what level of clearance Ms Newell received. It is possible she only received one of the two lower levels - BC, basic identity check, or CTC, counter-terrorism check. BC simply involves proof of identity, while CTC enables the holder to enter sensitive government buildings, provided he or she is not known to the security services. </p> <p>What seems certain is that Ms Newell was never subjected to full-scale vetting, which could have thrown up financial circumstances and her newspaper connections. This process is now called DV, for \"developed vetting\". </p> <p>It involves extensive grilling and inquiries about a candidate's private life, drinking habits, finances, and political activities. DV clearance is so time-consuming and expensive that it is reserved for full-timers with access to top-level military and intelligence secrets. </p> <p>The Josephine Sammons commercial agency, which supplied Ms Newell to the Cabinet Office, does not try to get DV clearances for temps. It says: \"Sammons are able, through our extensive network of contacts built over several decades, to procuresecurity clearance for our temporary workers (BC, CTC and SC level).\" </p> <p>The Cabinet Office carries out its own security checks, in line with those handled by the DVA, which deals with military contracts. </p> <p>The Josephine Sammons agency declined to say anything other than: \"There is an investigation.\" </p> <p>The Sunday Times has refused to comment on allegations that it was paying Ms Newell. Ms Newell also refused to comment. Labour MP Clive Soley, a former chair of the parliamentary Labour party, said yesterday: \"It would be wrong if a newspaper paid or offered inducements for a general fishing expedition.\" </p> <p>Replying to a written parliamentary question by Tory MP Christopher Chope, the Cabinet Office minister Ruth Kelly said yesterday: \"The person in question was provided to the Cabinet Office by an agency which provides temporary staff to the Cabinet Office. Following the incident, her assignment was terminated.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jabier, who works for the Eagle agency, was one of the paparazzi who witnessed the fracas involving Prince Harry. He has been a photographer for 14 years and has worked as a paparazzo for four.</p> <p>\"When I started to work on the streets four years ago there were a lot less people, but in the last year and half the number of paparazzi has really increased. </p> <p>\"So many start with the big agencies, they turn up there and want to become photographers, and the agencies just give them a camera and send them out on a kind of trial. </p> <p>\"One photograph can give them their salary for a week. For something like Prince William or Prince Harry, say, they can reach anywhere up to \u00a330,000 or \u00a340,000. The photographer will get 60% and the agency gets 40%. </p> <p>\"Some photographers though, especially the less experienced ones, they don't give room for a celebrity to walk on the street. They think if they get close to a celebrity no one is going to block their way, but some will only give one or two metres distance. </p> <p>\"If I put my face two centimetres from someone's nose then you are going to be intimidated. When you've been in a nightclub and you've had a few drinks, you are going to say: 'What the fuck are you doing in my face?' </p> <p>\"Harry is a really nice guy, I like him. With William, he gets very personal because of what happened with his mum, and because of that I don't want to follow them. </p> <p>\"I make a good living. Sometimes you have to chase people at high speed, jump red lights, do things you are not supposed to do. I am not willing to take that risk with Harry and William though, as I don't want anything to happen. </p> <p>\"I do try to give a lot of distance to celebrities, and some people cooperate, some don't. [The paparazzi] do what they want and there are not any rules. </p> <p>\"Around 10% [of celebrities] will tell me they don't want to be photographed. The others don't care. As long as it is not a scandal, they are happy to be photographed. For most of them though, without the tabloids and gossip magazines, no one would pay millions of pounds to them. For example, Liz Hurley makes all her money from the media, so if she says 'Don't take my photo', then I will take it anyway. </p> <p>\"And Sienna Miller - in the beginning, I would take photos of her and she was very keen to be photographed. Now she is with Jude Law and part of the golden couple of the year and it is different. </p> <p>\"One day in Primrose Hill she fell down in the park and I got photos of her and she came to me screaming. From that point when she sees me she puts her head down and runs away, and I say 'sorry it doesn't work that way'. </p> <p>\"It's a game. I want to get them; they don't want me to. It's all about the thrill.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Evening Standard</strong><br> Editorial, London, October 21 </p> <p> \"If it was Michael Howard's intention to stretch his arts spokesman, Boris Johnson, on the rack of political torture, he has succeeded. Mr Johnson ... who combines the role of Spectator editor with that of Tory frontbencher, was dispatched to Liverpool [on Wednesday] to apologise for an article in the magazine that accused the city of wallowing in victim status after the death of Ken Bigley ... </p> <p>\"The episode has demonstrated that the job of editor and frontbench politician has difficulties: the editor could not robustly defend his magazine while at the same time acceding to the demands of Mr Howard.\" </p> <p><strong> Joe Riley</strong><br> Liverpool Echo, October 18 </p> <p> \"While I abhor ... Mr Johnson's blundering gaffes, I would defend him in one respect ... It concerns the moral censorship of journalism by political leaders.

It also means ... Mr Johnson ... should consider his position on the opposition benches. Just as he should consider his position as editor of the Spectator ... The two jobs, once they begin to tread [on] common ground, are ultimately untenable.\" </p> <p><strong> Stephen Glover</strong><br> Daily Mail, October 19 </p> <p> \"Surely the lesson of this affair is that employment at the highest level in politics and in journalism at the same time is incompatible ... </p> <p>\"The editorial was ... unacceptably brutal in tone.

  "American biotechnology firm Amgen yesterday lost its right to produce a billion-dollar anaemia drug, Epogen, exclusively in the UK after a House of Lords ruling. <p>It had challenged the right of US firm Transkaryotic Therapies and French multinational Sanofi-Aventis to sell their rival Dynepo, even though the drug is a version of a natural hormone, EPO. </p> <p>The Lords said that Amgen's patent could not hold in the UK; it is contrary to a recent US ruling that went in Amgen's favour. \"It is clear that Amgen have got themselves into difficulties because, having invented a perfectly good and ground-breaking process for making EPO ... they were determined to try to patent the protein itself, notwithstanding that, even when isolated, it was not new,\" the ruling said. </p> <p>EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells, counter-acting anaemia. When Amgen discovered a way of making EPO, it patented the technology, but the method for producing Dynepo had not been invented at that stage. </p> <p>\"Because the technology has advanced so much, no one could have envisaged you could do what Transkaryotic does,\" said Stephen Bennet at law firm Lovells. \"People already had a view that the UK is quite mean on patent infringement, this will reinforce that.\" </p> <p>Amgen's main anaemia treatment in Europe is Aranesp, so the ruling will not hurt its business.</p>",
  "An increasingly bitter split within Israel's ruling Likud party has deepened ahead of a vote by MPs on Ariel Sharon's Gaza withdrawal plan after the speaker of parliament accused the prime minister of betraying the country. <p>Reuven Rivlin, an influential force in Likud and former ally of Mr Sharon, has sent a highly charged letter to members of the party's central committee. </p> <p>In it he warned that if the prime minister pressed ahead with his \"disengagement plan\", it would not end with the removal of 7,500 Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip, but with Israel giving up all its colonies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem - home to about 420,000 Jews. </p> <p>\"Let us make no mistake, this is only the beginning. Someone who declares himself an occupier in Gush Katif [in Gaza] will not be able to stop capitulating there,\" he wrote. </p> <p>The Gaza pullout plan has not weakened Israeli resolve to crack down on Palestinian militants, as this month's incursion into the territory demonstrated. </p> <p>Last night Israel killed the leading Hamas bombmaker in a Gaza City air strike. Adnan al-Ghoul had been on a wanted list for 17 years. </p> <p>But the tough military tactics have not assuaged opponents of the pullout. </p> <p>Mr Rivlin accused the prime minister of disloyalty to Likud's guiding ideology that Israel should control all of the occupied territories. </p> <p>\"The disengagement law arouses horror,\" he said. \"Sharon and the leaders who support the plan are not loyal to the land of Israel and the principles of the [Likud] movement.\" </p> <p>The letter has added to the growing belief that the ruling party could split after next Tuesday's Knesset vote. </p> <p>Mr Sharon is expected to win, but only with the help of the opposition Labour party. Its leader, Shimon Peres, has promised to give the government a safety net in parliament to carry out the withdrawal. </p> <p>Press surveys of the 120 MPs' voting intentions suggest that Mr Sharon will be backed by 66, with 41 against and 13 undecided or likely to abstain. </p> <p>But the surveys also show that Likud is divided, with 22 of its MPs backing the prime minister and 18 - including cabinet ministers - intending to vote against him. </p> <p>Mr Rivlin said the vote would rip Likud apart. \"Those who say there will not be a split do not know what they are talking about. Until today I could sit with Sharon and [deputy prime minister Ehud] Olmert and [cabinet minister] Tzippi Livni in one party, knowing there is a debate between us but an abyss between all of us and Peres. Today, the debate between Peres and myself is similar to the debate between Sharon and myself.\" </p> <p>Settlers and their supporters say they will lay siege to parliament during the two days of debate on disengagement next week. They plan to bring hundreds of children who will lose their homes to lead the protest, and to block traffic with slow-moving cars. </p> <p>Those Likud MPs who back Mr Sharon's plan have come under furious pressure. One MP, Ruhama Avraham, said she had received threats on her pager and faxes that were signed by \"Likudniks who know how to settle accounts with traitors\". </p> <p>Another MP, Eli Aflalo, suffered a minor stroke which he attributed to the growing pressure on him by opponents of the withdrawal plan. </p> <p>Israel's justice minister, Yosef Lapid, hit out yesterday at rabbis who have urged soldiers to disobey orders to remove settlers from Gaza. </p> <p>\"We have reached the outer limits of our patience with statements that could pose a danger to public security,\" Mr Lapid told Reuters news agency. \"I fear there is a risk of bloodshed. I hope it does not spill over into civil war.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> An explosion blamed on Palestinian militants killed an Israeli soldier on the Gaza-Egypt border yesterday.

  "The Democrats made a play yesterday for crucial votes from conservative middle America, depicting their candidate as a \"regular guy\" who likes nothing better than watching baseball and shooting geese. <p>In an effort to counter criticism that John Kerry is an arch-liberal out of touch with ordinary people, he was shown gun-in-hand on a shoot only hours after being pictured beer-in-hand for a ball game. </p> <p>The aim, as Mr Kerry sought votes in the key swing state of Ohio, was to show the blueblooded Massachusetts senator as a man of the people. </p> <p>Or as the senior Kerry adviser Mike McCurry said: \"We want people to have a better sense of John Kerry the guy.\" </p> <p>George Bush, meanwhile, headed for the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, which he has visited 14 times since March. </p> <p>The two main candidates are piling on the mileage and peppering the battleground states with appearances as they fight for the votes on which the election will turn on November 2. </p> <p>Pennsylvania has 21 votes in the electoral college, Ohio 20; 270 are needed to win. </p> <p>In Florida, the third big battlefield state, a poll by Quinnipiac University released yesterday showed President Bush leading Mr Kerry by 48% to 47%. A fortnight ago the poll gave Mr Bush a 51-44% lead. </p> <p>The Kerry camp has asked former Vice-President Al Gore to campaign today in Florida, where recounts finally gave Mr Bush the state by 537 votes, and the presidency, in 2000. </p> <p>It hopes Mr Gore, the loser then, will remind voters of the importance of turning out. Former President Bill Clinton will join the fray next week. </p> <p>But Mr Kerry was taking a break from formal campaigning yesterday when he made a hunting trip in Ohio, wearing camouflage and carrying a 12-bore shotgun. He claimed to have shot a bird, but tellingly his aides carried the quarry. </p> <p>The hunting trip was designed to speak to gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association in Ohio. Mr Gore was criticised for not doing more to woo gun owners in the state in the 2000 election. </p> <p>The NRA bought a full a page advertisement in a local paper in Youngstown, near where the hunt took place, accusing Mr Kerry of posing as a sportsman while voting against gun-owners' rights. Mr Kerry has denied the accusation, although he did vote in favour of a ban on assault weapons and a measure requiring background checks at gun shows. </p> <p>The hunting trip came after an evening of baseball, as Mr Kerry nestled in a rather cramped sofa with two aides to watch the crucial final play-off between the Boston Red Sox and their bitter rivals, the New York Yankees. The Red Sox's win, which put them in the World Series, was hailed as one of the greatest comebacks in baseball history. </p> <p>\"They're the greatest comeback team there is,\" Mr Kerry told journalists summoned to watch him watching the game and drinking beer from a bottle. </p> <p>Later yesterday the candidates were back on the stump and on the attack. </p> <p>Mr Bush criticised Mr Kerry's healthcare policy, saying in Pennsylvania that it would imply \"bigger government with higher costs\". </p> <p>Mr Kerry rebuked Mr Bush for opposing stem cell research, enlisting Dana Reeve, the widow of the Superman actor Christopher Reeve, to join him in making the case for the science. </p> <p>He said Mr Bush's opposition betrayed \"an extreme political agenda that slows instead of advances science\". </p> <p>On a broader front, the Annenberg Electoral Survey reported yesterday that since the opening of early voting in 35 states, 5% of registered voters were thought to have cast their ballots, and a further 17% were expected to vote before polling day. </p> <p>Other studies suggest the final figure could be as high as 25-30%. </p> <p>But international election monitors who visited the US in September issued a report criticising the partisan nature of American election monitoring. </p> <p>\"Partisan oversight and administration of elections is not the international norm,\" the report sponsored by the human rights group Global Exchange said, \"as it builds in the possibility for the perception of conflicts of interest. </p> <p>\"The delegation recommends that states establish independent and impartial bodies to administer, oversee, and certify elections.\" </p> <p>Today Mr Kerry is expected to deliver a speech about his Catholic faith, a strand in his life he repeatedly emphasised in last week's final TV debate. </p> <p>He is also expected to make a direct appeal to women voters, crucial to his chance of winning the election, when he speaks in Milwaukee. </p> <p>His strategists said the aim was to deliver a series of detailed policy speeches, in contrast to the broader approach of the Bush camp, and to contrast Mr Kerry's message with the president's argument that the senator was a \"bad man\", while striking a balance between \"the tactical political stuff that really keeps your supporters excited in the field and the substantive message\".</p>",
  "<p>Taking the pill can reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer, according to research out yesterday. </p> <p>Researchers from Wayne State University in Detroit used data from 162,000 women in the largest and most comprehensive study of the long-term consequences of taking the contraceptive. </p> <p>The findings contradict previous research suggesting a link with heart disease and tumours, and will prove reassuring to the 3 million women who take the pill in Britain. </p> <p>The study found that birth control pills reduce the incidence of heart attacks and other forms of cardiovascular disease and lower the incidence of certain types of cancer, including ovarian and endometrial cancer. </p> <p>Oral contraceptives were found to have no effect on rates of breast and cervical cancer, high blood pressure and stroke - all of which have been suggested as dangers by previous research. </p> <p>Rahi Victory, who led the research, said: \"These are important findings that contravene previous results on links between oral contraceptives and cardiovascular disease. </p> <p>\"These data suggest that oral contraceptive use has important benefits, and that if you use them for a longer time you get an increased benefit. If you use oral contraceptives early on you're probably going to be protected later in life.\" </p> <p>The findings were presented in Philadelphia at a conference held by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. They are the latest to emerge from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), which has linked hormone replacement therapy to breast cancer, heart disease and strokes. </p> <p>The study used the WHI's database of 161,809 women who had taken the pill at one time or another to investigate whether it had any impact on developing heart disease or lung cancer. The results were compared with those women who had not taken it. </p> <p>Studies since the introduction of the pill in the 1960s have repeatedly claimed that the hormones in the pill increased the risk of heart disease. But Michael Diamond, part of the research team, said the research found the hormones reduced the risk of hypertension, heart attacks, strokes, aneurysms and high cholesterol by between 8% and 10%. </p> <p>Taking the pill reduced the need for surgical procedures such as angiograms and bypasses by 20% to 50%. The longer women took the pill, the greater the reduction in risk. Overall, women who took the pill had a 7% lower risk of cancer. </p> <p>Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: \"Given that so many women use the pill as their main form of contraception, any study that shows health benefits above and beyond its excellent record on preventing pregnancy is to be welcomed.\" </p> <p>Experts said the findings would have to be replicated in further research before use of the pill could be recommended as anything other than a form of contraception.</p>",
  "British officers will have complete control over how they conduct offensive operations in their new deployment south of Baghdad, defence chiefs insisted yesterday. <p>The US appears to have given General Sir Michael Walker, chief of the defence staff, the assurances he was seeking before agreeing to the American request to fill in for US marines planning a new assault on Falluja, west of Baghdad. </p> <p>Gen Walker said yesterday that he had formally told Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, on Wednesday night that the government should accede to the American request on military grounds. </p> <p>He described the move as a \"clear-cut operational imperative\" which would contribute to \"the overall strategic aim of elections in Iraq in January 2005\". </p> <p>Both Gen Walker and Gen Sir Mike Jackson, head of the army, expressed serious concern last week about command and control arrangements with the Americans; the amount of time the Black Watch would spend in the high-risk area being vacated by the US marines; the gap the regiment would leave behind in southern Iraq; and the danger of \"mission creep\". </p> <p>The Black Watch battle group would remain under the full operational command of Major General Bill Rollo, the British commander in Basra, Gen Walker said yesterday. </p> <p>He said it was \"unlikely\" that the US would ask British troops to operate in Falluja, where American attacks, many from the air, have led to many hundreds of Iraqi casualties. If the US were to do so, he said, a decision would be taken in London and not by British commanders in Iraq. </p> <p>Speaking later to journalists, a senior British defence official said Lieutenant Colonel James Cowan, commander of the 850-strong Black Watch battle group, would have \"total control over what is attacked in his area\". </p> <p>While the regiment's commanding officer could ask the US forces to attack particular targets in his area, any US request for the Black Watch to attack targets could be vetoed by Gen Rollo, the official insisted. </p> <p>Mr Hoon admitted yesterday that concerns had been expressed about British forces coming under American command and about their rules of engagement. Any changes in the troops' mission would have to be referred back to Gen Rollo, he told MPs. </p> <p>He also said that the British forces would \"operate at all times under UK rules of engagement\". </p> <p>However, Iraqi forces which have been operating with US marines south of Baghdad in the area to which the Black Watch is being dispatched come under a different chain of command. </p> <p>US and Iraqi forces have recently conducted intensive arrest operations against suspect insurgents in the area, which includes a key bridge across the Euphrates, an important route for insurgents moving in and out of cities, including Falluja and Baghdad. </p> <p>The Black Watch battle group will deploy to its new area over the next few days in what will itself be a potentially dangerous operation, defence officials admitted. </p> <p>Gen Walker said yesterday there was a 30-day limit on their deployment. Tony Blair promised on Wednesday that the regiment would be home for Christmas. </p> <p>Following concern among defence chiefs about a gap left in Basra, the 1st Battalion Scots Guards will be sent to southern Iraq next month. </p> <p>This will increase the total number of British troops in Iraq. Mr Hoon told MPs yesterday that the \"overall trend\" in the number of British soldiers in the country \"remains down\". However, with the deployment of the Scots Guards, the number will rise to more than 9,000 from 8,500. Mr Hoon said there were \"no plans\" to send a further 1,300 to Iraq, as suggested by the British commander in Baghdad. </p> <p>But Gen Walker suggested yesterday he would be prepared to send more British troops to Iraq in the run-up to the elections there. </p> <p>In response to repeated questions why the US needed 800 British troops when they had 133,000 of their own in Iraq, Mr Hoon told MPs that less than a third of the US force had the \"requisite combat capability\".</p>",
  "Tony Blair faced searching questions from cabinet colleagues over the decision announced yesterday that 850 British troops would soon be moved from their base in southern Iraq to far more volatile and dangerous regions further north. <p>Mr Blair and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, were both asked to explain their reasons for meeting an American request for help in the US-controlled zone. Mr Hoon told MPs that a battle group of the Black Watch would be moved from Basra to a position south of Baghdad within days. </p> <p>The chief whip, Hilary Armstrong, told Mr Blair that the mood on the Labour backbenches was difficult. Tough questions were also asked at the cabinet meeting by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the party chairman, Ian McCartney. </p> <p>One source described it as one of the most intense sessions on Iraq for a long time. Some cabinet members were openly critical about the way the announcement was handled, and about the failure to quash speculation that the deployment was designed to boost George Bush before the US elections. </p> <p>The cabinet set aside a planned discussion on counter-terrorism legislation to discuss the deployment. One source said later they hoped that the prime minister's promise that the Black Watch troops would be home by Christmas would not come back to haunt him. </p> <p>British military chiefs, and Mr Hoon, insisted yesterday that the Black Watch battle group will be under the operational command of General Bill Rollo, the senior British officer in southern Iraq. </p> <p>Although the US marines would have an overall \"tactical control\" coordinating role, British defence chiefs insisted that the battlegroup would operate at all times under British rules of engagement. Any US request to change or expand their role would have to be agreed by British officers. </p> <p>The Black Watch group would also be deployed for a limited time - 30 days, said the chief of the defence staff, General Sir Michael Walker. </p> <p>These were the assurances he demanded last week before signing up to what he described yesterday as a \"clear cut operational imperative\" to support US forces planning an assault on Falluja. </p> <p>He entered choppy political waters by suggesting that Iraqi insurgents might try to exploit political concerns by attacking British troops to undermine support for the coalition and the operations in Iraq. </p> <p>\"If they spot a weakness they have a go in asymmetric warfare. We are opening the door to that in a way we need not have done,\" Gen Walker said. </p> <p>Mr Hoon told the Commons the British troops \"will bring important qualities of extensive training, experience and hard edge combat capability to replace a US armoured battle group of equivalent capability\". He said the military risk to British soldiers was acceptable. </p> <p>It appears British forces and politicians believe they may have greater influence over US tactics in the run up to the Iraqi elections in January if Britain has troops in forward positions in the area of greatest resistance to elections and the US presence. </p> <p>Some Sunni groups have already warned of a boycott of the elections if there is an assault on Falluja. </p> <p>Labour and Liberal Democ rat MPs expressed fears of \"mission creep\". They feared the US military assault would lead to unacceptable civilian casualties, and make Britain morally complicit in an exercise that would lower British standing in the Middle East. </p> <p>The former minister John Denham said Labour would pay a political price, especially if the civilian deaths were on the scale some feared. </p> <p>Mr Hoon challenged the Liberal Democrats to say if they supported democratic elections in Iraq. \"If they don't want those elections, they should say so, because their policy would directly lead to that conclusion.\" </p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, said the move was a \"necessary military contribution\".</p>",
  "The Hutton and Butler inquiries were directly concerned with the Iraq saga. They were high-profile events in the long public inquisition into the merits of the war into which Tony Blair took Britain. The two inquiries had, however, interest and significance beyond Iraq. In particular, the unfettered access they were given to people, papers and emails yielded an extraordinarily close and revealing portrait of how contemporary government has been functioning. <p>A great deal of this came as neither unexpected nor particularly disquieting to anyone who had worked closely in Whitehall across a span of administrations. However, there were significant exceptions to that relaxed recognition. The exposure, in the evidence Lord Hutton elicited, of the remarkable informality (to use no sharper term) of how business was transacted within No 10 was surely an uncomfortable surprise even to cognoscenti. The Butler report voiced justifiably adverse comment upon how the relationship had come to function between the intelligence world and key policy figures in and around No 10. Most striking, that report ended with what was a dramatically critical six-paragraph envoi about the way in which Mr Blair had run the collective cabinet dimension of his leadership. </p> <p>Whenever there is a change after one party has had a long run in office, the incomers are always tempted to suspect that those who worked for their predecessors may be deficient in commitment to a new agenda. The neutral mindset of thorough and loyal service to support whoever the electorate may place in power can seem alien or even incredible to those whose operating context has been the political struggle. A particularly protracted period out of office can intensify such attitudes. </p> <p>Mr Blair was the first prime minister since Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 to come to No 10 without previous experience at any level of government. He was surrounded by party colleagues who were mostly little better equipped. It was, moreover, not immediately obvious that those colleagues possessed the range and depth of talent to fill the span of cabinet posts. </p> <p>Against that background, it is neither surprising nor illegitimate that a prime minister of Mr Blair's abilities, coming to power with an exceptional endorsement of the electorate, should have chosen to operate in a more centralised way than almost any predecessor. And that in doing so he should have been keen to reshape working practices in new ways. </p> <p>It is, however, open to question whether the changes - often, it seemed, reflecting an impatience with collective process - always rested upon sufficient understanding that existing patterns had not been developed without practical reason. Where there is no written constitution and governmental practice rests largely upon convention rather than entrenched rule or statute, changes may be more easily made than in a more formalised setting. But that does not render thorough, timely and transparent evaluation any less important. In the governance of a large country, a highly centralised - even personalised - system of work may be in extra need of careful method and record. </p> <p>The absence of thorough analysis, and of a system for conducting it, had already been conspicuously displayed in the near shambles surrounding the attempt to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor. But Hutton and Butler suggested that the effects might run more widely. It was increasingly suspected that Mr Blair's administration often had little interest in or tolerance for distinctions of function and responsibility within the government machine. </p> <p>Not only in the interface with the intelligence structure and in the way Alastair Campbell operated, but also in matters such as the saga of Jo Moore and Martin Sixsmith in the Department of Transport, there was a sense of all participants - ministers, civil servants, special policy advisers, public relations handlers - being treated as part of an undifferentiated resource for the support of the central executive. </p> <p>Mr Blair has sought to bring to his office a strong focus on delivery - the achievement of practical results. However, this salutary concern can slide into a sense that outcome is the only true reality and that process is flummery. The two are not antithetical. Process is care and thoroughness; it is consultation, involvement and co-ownership; it is (as we were reminded by the failure of international process in the run-up to the Iraq war) legitimacy and acceptance; it is also record and clear accountability. It is often a significant component of outcome itself; and the more awkward and demanding the issue - especially amid the special gravity of peace and war - the more it may come to matter. </p> <p>Mr Blair swiftly indicated his intention to make adjustments in the light of the Butler report, but it was not immediately apparent whether he would choose - or be induced by cabinet colleagues - to carry these far enough to constitute a real change of approach. Cabinet government of the traditional model has manifestly atrophied over the past seven years, by deliberate neglect, not accident. Should we mind? If a collective cabinet system no longer functions well, and parliament is docile or impotent, we may be nearer to \"elective dictatorship\" than when Lord Hailsham coined the phrase a quarter of a century ago. Perhaps the country is content that the media should be the prime constraint upon highly centralised power. But the issues deserve public discussion. </p> <p>Tests of whether Mr Blair truly intends reform might include whether opportunities are to be exploited, as personnel changes arise, to revive the full scope and authority of the cabinet secretary post and to restore the focus of the secretariat on support of the cabinet as a whole. Another test might be the serious pursuit of a Civil Service Act to entrench basic safeguards. In an age where established convention commands less ready reverence than in the past, it may well be appropriate that roles, procedures and systems be more explicitly defined than used to be thought necessary. That may be the more desirable given the possibility that the next change of government may again bring into office a team with limited experience. </p> <p>The remedying of what went amiss matters, for reasons stretching beyond the life of the present government. Governing parties are more than just tenants of the constitutional structure; they have a right, even a duty, to modify it where they judge that the people will be better served. But they remain less than owners; they are more like trustees, with an obligation to maintain the structure and hand it on to successors in good working order. The Hutton and Butler scrutinies called into question whether the obligation was being fully secured. On that showing, Mr Blair and his proper advisers had repair work to do, and to demonstrate it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Michael Quinlan is a former permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence.

  "The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, is attempting to block a new law that would punish negligent employers with heavy fines or imprisonment in cases of deaths or injury at work. <p>The Guardian has obtained details of a letter sent by Mr Straw 10 days ago to John Prescott, deputy prime minister and chair of the domestic affairs cabinet committee. In it, the foreign secretary casts doubt on the need to create a new crime of corporate manslaughter. </p> <p>In his letter, written on October 11, he calls for a proper and \"collective discussion of this difficult issue before final decisions are taken. This is one of those issues when first considered appears unanswerable, but pose serious problems under further examination.\" </p> <p>He adds: \"There is a strong case for maintaining the current position\". </p> <p>The unexpected intervention into a domestic controversy will infuriate trades unions which have been campaigning for the reform for many years. The commitment for a draft bill was a cornerstone of the agreement between the government and unions reached at this summer's crucial Warwick forum. </p> <p>The prime minister in his conference speech also promised that a draft corporate manslaughter bill would be published before the Queen's speech next month. </p> <p>Mr Straw's letter will also perturb the home secretary, David Blunkett, who has been pushing for the reform inside Whitehall. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, despite the remorseless pressures of his overseas work, has the energy to take a very close interest in domestic issues. He remains especially interested in those areas that he used to oversee in his previous post as Mr Blunkett's predecessor. </p> <p>Some government members see Mr Straw's intervention as being supported from behind the scenes by the chancellor, Gordon Brown. Mr Straw has been thought to have been working closely with the chancellor on issues such as identity cards and the European constitution, but there is no independent evidence that Mr Straw has been leant on by the chancellor. </p> <p>The idea of making company directors personally responsible for deaths due to management failings has gripped legal debate since the Zeebrugge and Hillsborough tragedies in the 1980s. It was subsequently reignited by successive rail tragedies, including the Hatfield disaster in 2000. The attempted prosecutions of rail chiefs over the Hatfield rail crash, in which four people died, collapsed last month. </p> <p>Charges against Railtrack's former chief executive, Gerald Corbett, and two other managers were dropped before the main trial after a high court judge ruled there was insufficient evidence that the accident occurred because profit had been put before safety. </p> <p>Advocates of a new law argue it is also necessary to curb deaths among construction workers. More than 1,000 workers have died on construction jobs since 1992. </p> <p>Labour pledged in its 1997 election manifesto that it would legislate to introduce corporate manslaughter laws. But the legal profession, along with company directors and the families of the Hatfield victims, are still awaiting the draft bill. </p> <p>Due to the inadequacies of current legislation, there have been only three successful prosecutions to date for corporate manslaughter, even though numerous cases have been brought to court. </p> <p>With the Queen's speech expected on November 23, Mr Straw's intervention puts the commitment to a draft bill in serious jeopardy. It has also surprised cabinet members that he is seeking a first principles discussion after nearly a year of internal discussion by civil servants right across Whitehall. </p> <p>Trades unions claim they were given firm private assurances on the legislation from both the Labour chairman, Ian McCartney, and the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, the minister responsible for organising government business. </p> <p>Many senior civil servants have been trying to protect themselves from liability from prosecution under the law. But in his letter, Mr Straw acknowledges that solutions have been suggested for the long standing problems of crown immunity. </p> <p>One solution is to seek to draw a distinction between factual and policy advice. The aim would be for civil servants to face the risk of prosecution only if they had been negligent in their factual advice. </p> <p>Probably the biggest stumbling block to effective legislation is whether individuals at a company could be prosecuted, and, if so, how to decide who is personally responsible. </p> <p>It is acknowledged that whatever happens about publication of the draft bill, there is no chance of the legislation reaching the statute book before a general election next spring.</p>",
  "Although the official figures show that the fear of crime has fallen in the past year the public still finds it hard to believe that crime overall in England and Wales has dropped sharply in recent years. <p>The British Crime Survey results published yesterday confirm that there is still a large gap between the fear of crime and the actual crime rate whether recorded by the police or by more reliable methods. </p> <p>Those who say they have a \"high level of worry\" about being burgled has fallen in the past year from 14% to 12% while those who have a \"high level of worry\" about becoming a violent crime victim has fallen from 20% to 14%. </p> <p>This reduction in the fear of crime is matched by a fall in the level of concern about anti-social behaviour. Those who say they are very worried about \"teenagers hanging around on the streets\" has fallen from 32% to 27%. </p> <p>Concern about abandoned or burned-out cars in the neighbourhood is down from 21% to 14% reflecting action taken by local authorities. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, acknowledged yesterday that reducing the fear of crime was crucial to the government's record on law and order. </p> <p>He said there was gap between people's fear of crime and actual crime levels because the biggest falls had taken place in crimes such as burglary and car crime which received little publicity but accounted for the majority of offences. </p> <p>He said that violent crime, especially involving a death or serious injury, was much rarer but attracted far more media coverage and so was bound to have an impact on people's fear of crime. </p> <p>\"The new focus obviously raises the temperature through the media. This is not a blame the media culture. This is saying it is the obvious outcome of a change in perception. The much greater focus on gun culture and its link with crack obviously stimulates a much greater fear of crime.\" </p> <p>The BCS also reports that confidence levels in the criminal justice system have improved in the last year with 77% of the public saying that the police and courts do respect the rights of those accused of crime and treats them fairly. </p> <p>But there is a distinct lack of confidence in the juvenile justice system with only 25% saying that they are effective in dealing with young people accused of crime.</p>",
  "Lady Thatcher is one of four prominent Conservative peers who attend the House of Lords without claiming a penny, according to the first official figures released on peers' expenses. <p>The other three are the Earl of Home, David Douglas Home; Lord Waldegrave, the former chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory party treasurer. All of them attended between 13 and 39 Lords debates over the last financial year out of a possible total of 165 sitting days. </p> <p>Labour peers Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Viscount Simon, and Tory front bench spokeswoman Lady Seccombe and fellow Conservative Lord Campbell of Alloway, managed to attend every day. </p> <p>Some of the worst attenders, among peers known to be fit and well, include Lord Heseltine, who has only been twice and Lord Black of Crossharbour, the former Daily Telegraph owner now under investigation in United States, for alleged fraud, attended four times. Neither claimed any expenses. </p> <p>The two highest overnight expense claims came from two high attenders. Lord Addington, the Liberal Democrat whip, who attended all but two of the sitting days, claims \u00a325,184. Tory Lady Gardner of Parkes (who prefers to be known as Trixie Gardner) claimed \u00a324,824. She also attended 163 days. Both may soon be rivalled by Lord Irvine of Lairg, the former lord chancellor, who claimed \u00a316,032 towards his London home for 8 months after he was asked to resign by Tony Blair. </p> <p>Not all peers claimed for free postage. The highest bill was submitted by Labour's Lord Stone of Blackheath, who claimed \u00a3557 followed by Tory Lord Taylor of Warwick who claimed \u00a3499. The three smallest claims came from Lord Mitchell, a Labour peer, and Tories Lord Lucas of Crudwell and Lord Reay, who put in expenses for \u00a31. </p> <p>Most of the high travel claims came from Scottish and Ulster peers - though there were considerable variations. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat Lord Maclennan of Rogart claimed \u00a38,191 for travelling up to attend for 146 days from Caithness while another Liberal Democrat, Lord Mackie of Benshie, claimed \u00a310,931 for attending for 127 days from Angus. </p> <p>The law lords have separate entries to reflect the fact that they rarely attend debates in the house because they are sitting in court. </p> <p>Lord Hutton, for example, attended only three times and put in travel claims for \u00a32,471 from Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Since his retirement on the day of the publication of the Hutton report in January, he has only attended the House of Lords once up to the end of March. </p> <p>Bishops attend the Lords less frequently than many working peers - on average attending up to a third of all sittings.</p>",
  "Alcohol-fuelled violence, \"low-level thuggery\" and better reporting levels were blamed yesterday for an 11% rise in violent crime recorded by the police between April and June. <p>The rise masked a continuing fall in crime overall - by 5% on police figures and by 7% on the more authoritative British Crime Survey which were both published by the Home Office yesterday. </p> <p>The biggest falls were in domestic burglaries - down 23% on police figures, car crime which has fallen 18% and robberies down 15%. </p> <p>The drive against gun crime is to be intensified in the wake of annual figures showing firearms offences continuing to rise by 3% to 10,590 in the 12 months to June 2004. </p> <p>However, the number of people killed as a result of shootings fell from 82 to 70 over the same period. The fall may be linked to a 10% drop in the number of incidents involving a handgun and a 35% rise in the number involving a replica or imitation weapon. </p> <p>Home Office statisticians said that changes in the way the police record violent crime meant much of what is recorded, such as common assault, amounted to actions such as pushing and shoving, and involves little or no physical injury. </p> <p>The police recorded 303,000 violent incidents out of 1,447,400 offences between April and June this year. </p> <p>Chris Fox, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said that notwithstanding the impact of the changes, the rise was mainly the result of \"low-level thuggery\" and alcohol fuelled violence. </p> <p>\"In the run up to Christmas the police will again be concentrating on these areas to reduce harm to decent members of the public and our communities,\" he said. </p> <p>The British Crime Survey, which is based on interviews with 40,000 people, shows smaller falls in these big \"volume\" crimes. </p> <p>On violent crime the BCS gives a different picture to the police figures showing a fall of 6% compared with the 11% rise recorded by the police. The risk of becoming a victim of any crime is calculated at one in four adults - the lowest level since the BCS was started 23 years ago. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the home secretary, David Blunkett, acknowledged that he need to take the issue of violent crime \"head on\", saying there was a direct link between the spread of crack cocaine and gun culture. \"Recorded violence has pushed up concern. People are genuinely worried about them, so we are targeting them. </p> <p>Police efforts in the four cities which account for more than 75% of all firearms incidents - London, Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham - are to be intensified in the new year to coordinate the most effective tactics and clampdown on crack houses. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davies, said the rise in violent crime was due to the government's failure to deal with the drink and drug problems. \"It is far too easy to smuggle a weapon into the country, to convert a replica or to pick up a pistol for under \u00a3200.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' Mark Oaten said: \"Today's increase in firearms offences is totally unacceptable. The government is still not doing enough to stem the flow of guns on to the streets of our towns and cities. We need a national border force to stop these weapons reaching the UK in the first place.\"</p>",
  "Behind the long list of parliamentary expense claims released yesterday lie 659 different excuses. With the most expensive MP claiming three times the amount taken by cheapest, politicians faced the complex job of explaining why their costs vary so wildly. <p>Some pointed to their dedication to their constituents, and the heavy toll it took on their postage bill. Others highlighted the distance between their constituency and the House of Commons. Tickets on the British Airways shuttle to Scotland do not come cheap, after all. </p> <p>The figures are an early product of introducing freedom of information legislation. MPs must submit receipts for their claims - but add up the totals themselves. Commons officials admit they lack the resources to check many of the claims. </p> <p>Top of the list was an unexpected name. As Britain's most expensive MP, <b>Claire Curtis-Thomas</b> billed taxpayers for a total of \u00a3168,889 in allowances and expenses, in addition to her \u00a357,485 salary. </p> <p>She is Labour MP for Crosby, one of the flashier areas of Merseyside. She took her full \u00a320,033 allowance to provide a roof over her head in London, and \u00a318,780 to fund a local office and surgery, a mere \u00a319 less than the permitted maximum of \u00a318,799. Then there was \u00a371,773 to employ staff, \u00a327,155 on personal travel, another \u00a33,572 on travel for her staff, \u00a35,661 on stationery, \u00a319,038 in postage to deliver letters on the stationery to constitutents, \u00a32,021 for computers, and \u00a3559 in other costs. </p> <p>\"We don't know whether to be worried or to be honoured,\" said Ms Curtis-Thomas. \"We have got eight people working in our office, and during the course of last year visited all 33,000 homes in the constituency and held street surgeries. </p> <p>\"Some people up in Liverpool say we are doing far too much, and the figures show we are doing a lot.\" The headline totals do not tell the whole truth. Ms Curtis-Thomas, for example, has three young children living in the north-west; her travel bill includes mid-week trips home by road, rail or air to see her family. </p> <p>Neither is the MP at the bottom of the list quite as saintly as it might appear. Michael Trend, the Tory MP for Windsor, is shown to have claimed just \u00a356,657. Yet this represents not thrift, but the fact he was required to repay some \u00a390,000systematically and unlawfully claimed over several years for a London home he did not have. </p> <p>Runners-up in the official cost league are two Labour MPs who were embroiled in scandals during their parliamentary careers. </p> <p><b>Keith Vaz</b>, the MP for Leicester East and a former Europe minister, was suspended from the Commons for a month two years ago for serious breaches of the MPs code of conduct, received \u00a3164,265, including \u00a317,192 for travel - enough for more than three return first class train tickets to his constituency a week. though the total may include air travel to the EU, too. Third on the list was <b> Mohammad Sarwar</b>, a Scottish MP cleared of ballot-rigging allegations in 1997. He was paid \u00a3157,262 in expenses in the last financial year. </p> <p>The total of \u00a378.05m in allowances and expenses paid to MPs in 2003-04 was up on \u00a373.4m the previous year, and well ahead of the the \u00a357.49m in 2001-02 - with much of the increase down to better salaries for parliamentary staff. </p> <p>Each MP costs the taxpayer on average \u00a3175,000 a year including wages, but huge variations are exposed in the House of Commons commission figures. </p> <p>The travel bill of East Lothian Labour MP <b> Ann Picking</b> for the year, at \u00a339,744, was the highest in Westminster, and more than double the \u00a318,833 claimed by par liamentary neighbour <b> David Hamilton</b> who represents Midlothian. </p> <p>Ms Picking was travelling first class on the GNER London to Scotland service yesterday when the figures were released; she failed to respond to a message left on her mobile phone. </p> <p>Ten MPs, nine of them Labour, including the environment secretary, <b> Margaret Beckett </b> , who represents Derby South in the Midlands, lodged no personal travel costs, and did not charge up to 57p per mile for using a car on constituency business or train and plane fares. </p> <p>Stationery and postage costs similarly fluctuated wildly. Mitcham and Morden Labour MP <b> Siobhain McDonagh</b> claiming \u00a331,845 in stamps and \u00a39,078 on stationery as she deluged constituents with letters about her work. <b> Irene Adams</b>, Labour Paisley North, charged not a penny for postage or paper. </p> <p><b>Tony Blair</b>claimed \u00a315,490 towards the costs of Myrobella, his recently remortgaged Sedgfield constituency home in Trimdon colliery, as part of \u00a380,836 claimed in addition to his \u00a3178,922 salary as prime minister. </p> <p>MPs other than the 26 in inner London claim the so-called additional costs allowance to cover the cost of staying in the capital. Until February this year ministers were deemed to have their main homes in London, and received the allowance to cover the cost of visiting constituents. </p> <p>More than half of Mr Blair's expenses claim, some \u00a358,334, was used to employ staff, with \u00a33,978 spent on premises and equipment as an MP, \u00a3634 on travel, \u00a381 for staff travel, \u00a3117 on stationery, \u00a3326 on postage, and \u00a31,876 on computers. Tory leader <b>Michael Howard</b>, on \u00a3124,277 as opposition leader, claimed \u00a3126,658 in 2003-04, compared with \u00a379,930 in 2002-03. Liberal Democrat leader <b> Charles Kennedy</b> claimed \u00a3121,630 last year. </p> <p>The additional costs allowance is proving controversial. Brent North MP <b> Barry Gardiner</b>, a Northern Ireland minister, claimed the full \u00a320,033 out-of-town allowance to buy an Pimlico flat when his constituency is a 30-minute tube ride from central London but his main home is in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire. </p> <p>And Stevenage Labour MP <b>Barbara Follett</b>, married to novelist Ken Follett, has been criticised in the London Evening Standard for claiming the \u00a320,333 towards a Soho home when her husband's wealth is put by the tabloid as \u00a315m. </p> <p><b> Party by party</b> How they share the money</p> <p> <b> Labour </b><br> <b> Total claimed</b> \u00a348,470,436 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 407 <br><b> Average per MP</b> \u00a3119,091.98</p> <p> <b> Conservative </b><br> <b> Total</b> \u00a318,908,560 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 163<br> <b> Average</b> \u00a3116,003.44 </p> <p> <b> Liberal Democrat</b><br> <b> Total</b> \u00a36,510,347 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 54 <br> <b> Average</b> \u00a3120,561.98 <br></p> <p> <b> Plaid Cymru </b><br> <b> Total</b> \u00a3491,012 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 4 <br> <b> Average</b> \u00a3122,753 </p> <p> <b> SDLP </b><br> <b> Total</b> \u00a3330,073 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 3 <br> <b> Average</b> \u00a3110,024.33 </p> <p> <b> Sinn Fein </b><br> <b> Total</b> \u00a3439,452 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 4 <br> <b> Average</b> \u00a3109,863 </p> <p> <b> SNP </b><br> <b> Total</b> \u00a3683,154<br> <b> No of MPs</b> 5 <b> Average</b> \u00a3136,630.80 </p> <p> <b> Ulster Unionist</b><br> <b> Total</b> \u00a3577,100 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 5 <br> <b> Average</b> \u00a3115,420 <br></p> <p> <b> Democratic Unionist </b><br> <b>Total</b> \u00a3719,676 <br> <b> No of MPs</b> 6 <br> <b> Average</b> \u00a3119,946</p>",
  "<p>There is an interesting little section buried away in the Department for Education and Skills' website. In the parents' area, under the rights and responsibilities heading, the DfES attempts to define the relationship between the state and parents when it comes to children's schooling. </p> <p>You may be tempted to have a look at it if you're a parent cracking under the weight of exams, unclear about homework, worried about what your child is eating for school dinner, and hitting a brick wall each time you try to enter into a productive dialogue with his or her teachers. </p> <p>But don't raise your hopes. The guidance will explain what can be done to you - the fines, parenting contracts and orders if you fail to manage your child's behaviour or school attendance. You'll learn about the \u00a31,000 penalty you might incur if you break the terms of your order by failing to attend compulsory parent education sessions. </p> <p>But your rights? Well, it's a short list. You have the entitlement to a school place for your child, but not necessarily at the school you want. You have the right to receive an annual report on your child's progress, attendance records and the governors' report to parents. You can vote in parent-governor elections, give consent for school trips and be informed of any meeting concerning your child. </p> <p>Ministers are now considering extending this \"rights for the state, responsibilities for the parents\" agenda even further, possibly withholding benefits from adults who don't attend parenting classes when ordered to do so. </p> <p>Before they charge off in that direction, a period of consultation would be welcome. The government's desire to help make a success of parenting is crucial to addressing the social exclusion and criminal justice agendas. But rights cut two ways. It's a hard job raising children in the modern world. We are expected to turn out law-abiding, high-achieving, healthy citizens while managing the pressures of work and, in particular, the burgeoning independence of teenagers in a society which seems more full of risk than ever before, from security on the streets to the internet and a vast marketing industry pushing unhealthy food and costly goods at them. </p> <p>Most of us do take our responsibilities seriously. We get our children to school on time, encourage them to behave when they are there and would find the prospect of the increasingly big brotherish state with its fines and compulsory parenting orders more acceptable if it were allied to some basic entitlements for the parents who do keep their side of the bargain. </p> <p>Instead of more punitive plans to improve us, why not ask what rights might help parents? I am pretty sure what the answer would be. Apart from the right to good teachers, decent lavatories, drinking fountains and meals, what most parents want from a school is a guarantee of clear systems of communication; information about what their children will be learning; what coursework is expected; progress reports which include early warnings when problems develop; support when their children fall behind and practical suggestions of how we can help, especially at secondary level. The fiction is that these entitlements are enshrined in a system of home-school contracts. But most only set out an expectation of things that the school will \"try\" to do. </p> <p>Schools, burdened with targets, are the inevitable borderline between families and the state. It's understandable that some should see forging a relationship with parents as just another commitment. A real set of rights for parents to match our new legal responsibilities should be enshrined in home-school policies that are the statutory responsibility of every school and governing body (preferably to replace the collective act of worship). Tip the scales back to educating, informing and supporting parents in a partnership, rather than as a punishment. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Fiona.Millar1@btinternet.com\">Fiona.Millar1@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>All parts of an English language exam are a challenge, but for many learners the speaking element can present a dilemma. Candidates from cultures where the norms of spoken language use are very different can have great difficulty performing in these types of tests. Rules relating to status, politeness and other societal norms sometimes restrict the quantity and nature of spoken utterances. Such cultures also tend to use silence in a more calculated way than most English speakers.</p> <p>While it is very important to recognise these language rules and choices, the role of the teacher has to be to help students demonstrate their speaking ability. Put bluntly, spoken examinations and examiners cannot make any allowance for cultural differences of this kind. If they only hear silence, then that is what they mark on and the candidate will fail.</p> <p>Teachers can find that their task puts them in opposition to some deeply held beliefs and preferences. In my experience, the best way to handle this is to show you are sensitive to the issue and to be open and clear about your rationale. It is also important to explain that some difficult or uncomfortable moments are inevitable, but emphasise that the end result will be worth it. A guided visualisation of the student holding his or her certificate is a nice way to help create focus. A close bond of trust with the teacher is of particular benefit to these reticent students, and tutorial time is very helpful - both as speaking practice away from the group and to discuss concerns about the exam. </p> <p>In practical terms there are many classroom activities a teacher can use to help untie these tongue-tied learners. Anyone facing the unknown feels apprehensive, so assisting the student in learning as much as possible about the examination and how to impress the examiner is essential. Some exam boards produce sample exams on video or, if access to equipment is an issue, a role play between teachers or a teacher and an experienced student is very useful. A different approach is for learners to prepare small presentations of the different parts of the exam, and a quick quiz can check their grasp of the exam requirements.</p> <p>Once they are familiar with the exam, the teacher can then \"arm\" the students with lexis and strategies to release their potential. For tests where candidates are expected to interact, lessons focusing on discourse markers and functional phrases, such as agreeing and disagreeing, recapping, interrupting, asking for clarification and giving reasons, will be of great help. With a sufficient range of these at their disposal, candidates can concentrate better on the content of what they say. A set of cards with these phrases on can be used in different ways to help students learn how to use and remember them.</p> <p>The \"long turn\", common to many speaking tests, also presents certain problems. Our tongue-tied learners may be used to having such a presentation either memorised or written down to merely read out, both of which are, of course, unacceptable in an exam. Brainstorming lexis of common themes, taken from past exams, is a powerful tool. Comparing well and badly organised long turns can highlight good performance, combined with teaching of necessary phrases for moving from one point to another, giving examples and so on. </p> <p>A related issue is that in these cultures eye contact is often considered rude and being the focus of attention is anathema. To enable students to feel comfortable enough to speak, moving the focus away is vital. For example, one can use a game in which each student has an object for which they have to invent a background story and present it to the class - like an elaborate auction-house setting. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, sharing personal photographs may seem inappropriate to some students. Similarly, they may not feel comfortable talking about themselves and their lives, but this does form part of many examinations. To counter this, one activity that works well is for a small group of students to sit in a circle with one taking the role of the candidate and the others the examiners, who ask some general questions. Those posing questions have to work particularly hard because their job is to build on the candidate's answers by asking follow-on questions, ie: \"You mentioned your sister is a teacher. What age group does she teach?\" Or: \"So you've decided to study economics. What made you choose this subject?\" </p> <p>Encouraging practice outside the classroom is always a good thing but more so for reticent speakers. Where recording facilities are available, students can speak without the pressure of an audience and closely examine their language performance to find areas for improvement. Finally, a technique that students tell me is \"crazy but works\": having conversations in your head in English can go some way towards normalising the act of speaking.</p> <p>Culturally tongue-tied students do not necessarily have to fear speaking exams - especially if they have a teacher who is ready and prepared for the challenge.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sue Hobbs is a teacher and trainer at The Swan School of English, Oxford, England</p>",
  "<p>Lynton Crosby, who has masterminded John Howard's election victories in Australia, has now been recruited to direct the Tory campaign (Howard's way, October 20). I have just come back from attending to a family illness there. They don't have a national health service, but one based on health insurance. Sick people are advised to check what their insurance covers before they accept treatment. The election was going on while I was there. Central to the successful Liberal campaign were scare stories of tax increases if Labor got in. Labor's crime was to promise older pensioners the hospital treatment they need free, irrespective of the insurance they can afford.</p> <p>In Britain, such scare stories may not work. We value an NHS free for those who need it. But Conservative health spokesmen have been talking about new approaches to health funding. Is Crosby's appointment a further sign of the style and content of Conservative campaigning to come?<br> <strong>Richard Burden MP</strong><br> Lab, Birmingham Northfield<br></p> <p>We are told that patients will be able to choose which outpatient department they can attend.

So he walked round to the surgery. There he was told that there was no doctor available. He should have rung earlier.

  "<p>Legal &amp; General yesterday accused the Financial Services Authority of unfairness and acting unlawfully as it summed up its appeal against a \u00a31.1m fine for mis-selling of endowment mortgages. </p> <p>The insurance group claimed the City watchdog had acted unlawfully when it wrote a letter saying it would review the size of the penalty only if L&amp;G agreed not to take the case to a tribunal. </p> <p>\"The correspondence can only be viewed as an unfortunate and misplaced attempt or apparent attempt to put pressure on a party not to refer the case to the tribunal,\" said Charles Flint QC, acting for L&amp;G. </p> <p>In a statement the FSA said: \"The FSA's case is not - however much L&amp;G would like it to be - about the FSA's procedures.

  "In August last year I got an email suggesting I took a look at a weblog being written by an American soldier in Iraq: \"I hope we uncover all the banned weapons that we said were here,\" it said. \"I hope we find it all, every last bit: then all of this will have served a glorious purpose that no one can argue with.\" <p>\"I need to know that I helped unplug a dangerous beast before it struck. I need to know that for all those that have died, their deaths were not in vain. I need to know that we have prevented horrendous events from transpiring . . . and I want all of this to go down in history as 'the right thing to do'.\"</p> <p>Sergeant Sean was writing his blog, Turningtables, from Baghdad. It was funny, it had a very distinctive voice, and somehow it did not fit with the Terminator image of American soldiers in Baghdad.</p> <p>A couple of days ago, I emailed Sean to ask whether he could hook me up with a soldier who was in Baghdad and is now in the DC area. I wanted to sit down with an American soldier over beers and talk about Iraq. Since there is no chance of this happening in Baghdad any time soon, this trip to the US would be my opportunity. </p> <p>And guess who lives and works in the DC area after finishing his six-year enlistment? Sean - Mr Turningtables - is here himself, and he said he would be glad to meet me. We had dinner together and talked about a million things. </p> <p>You have no idea how strange it feels that we share so much in common. When I told him I would never actually approach an American soldier on the street in Baghdad, he told me that if we were in Baghdad he would probably be talking to me with his gun pointing at me because he would be scared shitless. Yet there we sat, drinking beers together.</p> <p>We exchange stories about how badly both of us are dealing with sounds of things popping. He tells me he will never again go to a July 4 celebration because of the fireworks, and I tell him how I got laughed at when I ducked and ran after a car backfired near me in London. </p> <p>Sean is only 26 years old. Six of those years have been spent in the US army as part of the signals corps. We have similar taste in music and we talk about good remixes of Jamiroquai songs.</p> <p>He tells me how scared he was when he had to drive through Baghdad. On one of those drives, from one base to another, he had his gun pointing out of the window of his Humvee when he noticed that he was pointing it at a little girl who sitting in the car beside them. She looked him straight in the eye. He tells me about how frightening it was to be in a badly armoured Humvee and have to be the decoy that attracts fire away from the bigger fish in armoured civilian vehicles.</p> <p>I sit here bonding with an American soldier. He tells me about a couple of good clubs to go to on Saturday and tells me to give him a call if I want to \"get down and get crazy\". When it is time for him to go back to his new home and wife - he got married in Las Vegas weeks after he came back from Baghdad - we shake hands and hug. I tell him I don't really understand what he was doing in the military; he tells me he went into it to get out of a dead-end life. </p> <p>And about being in Baghdad? \"I was there because I was ordered to be there. That is my reason, my sole reason. My personal feelings mean nothing. I was not asked and I will not be asked. I'm cool with that ... because I don't work in a democracy - I work for one.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the important things about living in a democracy is remembering that just because you couldn't care less about something, it doesn't mean it isn't very important to other people. However, when it comes to motor racing, I'm afraid the rest of us are struggling a bit. </p> <p>\"Do you realise what's about to happen?\" the enthusiasts have implored all week. \"No F1 race at Silverstone next year! No British Grand Prix! Is that the sort of country you want to live in?\" </p> <p>\"Um ... well, you know, we'll just have to do our best to cope.\" </p> <p>British motor sport is in crisis. Talks broke down this week between the British Racing Drivers' Club (which owns Silverstone) and formula one's commercial supremo, Bernie Ecclestone. Neither side was able to find answers to some very difficult questions, such as \"why do the cars just go round and round like that with nothing ever changing?\" \"Why does the winner have to waste all that champagne at the end?\" and \"Does Murray Walker really sound like that or am I just thinking of Rory Bremner's impression?\" </p> <p>Of course, formula one is not always boring, but generally you have to wait ages for a crash. These days you can get dreadful pile-ups far more regularly on When the World's Weirdest Police Chases Go Bad! over on Sky One. </p> <p>Unless this dispute is settled soon, Silverstone's place on the Grand Prix calendar may be lost and we will never know who would have come second to Michael Schumacher. The famous venue isn't just a racetrack, it's also used as a driving school, although they generally try and get the nervous learners off the course before any of the races. \"There's someone very keen to overtake me ... \" says Mrs Johnson, doing 20mph in the Nissan Micra, with a roaring high-powered Ferrari almost touching her L-plates. </p> <p>\"Good, you're using your rear view mirror, that's good ... \" </p> <p>\"He's swerving around right behind me, trying to squeeze past ... \" </p> <p>\"OK, Mrs Johnson, let's have another go at the emergency stop ... \" </p> <p>They could still use the circuit for other sorts of motor racing of course: mums in 4x4s dashing to get the last parking place outside the nursery school maybe, or a race in which mini-cab drivers have to go once round the track and still manage to get lost on the way there. </p> <p>There is also talk of holding a Grand Prix through the streets of London, which would certainly liven things up a bit. First the cars attempt to pull away while squeegee merchants are still cleaning their windscreens. Then they accelerate into the long straight that is Park Lane, before suddenly hitting the brakes at the same time as they all spot the first speed camera. </p> <p>Michael Schumacher nearly crashes into Jacques Villeneuve, because he's fiddling with his mobile phone to try to pay the congestion charge. Finally, down the Mall, the cars hit 120mph. But now everyone has to stop because a four-year-old has pressed the button on the pelican crossing, even though his mum isn't crossing the road. Meanwhile, the British driver is stuck in the pits because he pulled over to get his tyres changed and the guys from Kwik-Fit never say \"Naah, we don't keep those in stock, you'll have to go over to our Croydon branch.\" </p> <p>Logistical problems surrounding this event mean that such speeds will not be witnessed on British roads for many years unless Princess Anne starts driving again. </p> <p>Ecclestone has got himself into such a powerful position within the sport that he can demand any price he likes or leave Silverstone out of next year's F1 calendar. His grip over the sport is such that even Scalextric sets now come with a tiny little plastic figure of a grey-haired man with glasses with a glamorous young wife towering over him. Once a second-hand car dealer, Ecclestone is now a billionaire in control of one of the world's most glamorous sports, touring the world's hot spots surrounded by fast cars, champagne and beautiful women. Yeah, but is he happy? </p> <p>The F1 supremo claims that Silverstone's facilities do not come up to scratch compared with brand-new, government-funded circuits in places such as China and Malaysia; the subtext being that the government should cough up the millions he is demanding. This is the BRDC's solution as well. \"Look, I'm afraid Bernie Ecclestone is being rather greedy, so could the government fund that please?\" </p> <p>It's a really tough one. The government has a set amount of money to put into sport. Would these millions be better spent on developing grassroots facilities across a range of games and activities, or should it just hand a huge cheque over toEcclestone? </p> <p>Hmmm, it's one of those really agonising dilemmas that make you glad someone else has to take those impossible decisions. One way or another, Ecclestone will emerge from this even richer than he was before. And that's what's so boring about F1 racing. The same bloke always wins. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "This morning, while walking to get my bagel, I notice that the street my hotel is on is full of stickers saying \"Drunk Drivers for Bush/Cheney\". But the best has to be a bumper sticker saying \"Somewhere in Texas, a village is missing its idiot\". <p>I was still sleepy, so it took a while to figure that one out - I am slow in the morning. Which worries me a bit, because my brain should be up and running in less than half an hour - I have an appointment with an \"Iraq expert\" at the National Defence university.</p> <p>When I get there, I need to show the guard a photo ID. I pull out my press pass, but he doesn't like it. He wants to see my passport, and we all know how much I hate that. He looks at it and says, \"Oh, Airakian!\". I worry that my brain is still not up to speed - I am just getting used to \"Airaki\" with the big Ai at the beginning, and this was another variation - you have to admit it is very creative. I am given directions and allowed to walk in unescorted which, surprised me a bit - it is the National Defence university, after all.</p> <p>I feel like I have just stepped into a war movie set. This is the beginning, where they are still being trained. It is the scene where you get to see the main character amongst his colleagues who will be saved by the brave hero later in the movie. Red brick two storey buildings and big green squares with young officers marching in formation and joggers in white t-shirts saying \"good morning\" when they hop by. I am so out of place here: ET really needs to go home.</p> <p>While waiting for Judith Yaphe to come down and sign me in, I see a quote in huge letters on the wall \"We are concerned with the peace of the entire world, and the peace can only be maintained by the strong\" - Gen George C Marshall. Oh dear - I don't know if I am going to like this. But the moment she shows up, I know we are going get along just fine - she looks exactly like my French teacher from middle school in Baghdad. She has the same comforting presence.</p> <p>As a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the university, Japhe has been \"doing Iraq for the last 30 years\". And my guess is if you do someone for so long you must know them pretty well, especially when you were doing them for \"the agency\". We go up to her office, which is reassuringly chaotic. When I walk into an office that is too organised, I start panicking. </p> <p>She is wearing a necklace holding a little pendant, which has \"Allah\" written in Arabic, and another one with Hebrew lettering. The cord holding her office badge had \"Mission: Baghdad\" printed on it, sending signals in all directions. I was offered a warm coke - the full sugar feast, not the wimpy diet thing.</p> <p>She tells me that she has written her PhD thesis on the 1920 Iraqi revolt against the British occupiers at the time, and thinks there are some similarities between then and now - but does anyone want to learn? She doesn't think so. \"Here is what the British did. And here are the mistakes. Why do you repeat them? You don't set up a false front democracy, you don't set up buildings and institutions and then deny them power. You can't engineer, stage-manage and hold phoney elections. And you are also writing their constitution? Oh, OK.\"</p> <p>\"The lack of knowledge about Iraq among the people making decisions here is appalling\", she says. When it came to the time to go for war, the administration fully believed that it was going to be a short conflict, the Americans would be welcomed with flowers, and everything would be fine. </p> <p>\"If you believe that, and you want to do War-Lite, then you won't plan enough. Is that stupid? Yes, I would say it is stupid.\"</p> <p>But there was another possibility; in a parallel universe where the Pentagon did not take over, Ahmad Chalabi didn't exist, and the Bush administration did listen to people like Yaphe, there might be an Iraq that managed to get out of the mess of war with less damage. But we will never know.</p> <p>Back in this universe, \"the greatest democracy on this earth\" is holding elections in a couple of days. They are presidential elections which will have far wider consequences than just in the US - if you buy into Yaphe's worst case scenario and live in the Middle East, I suggest you start stocking up. \"My worst case scenario is that Bush gets re-elected and the people that did Iraq come back and decide to continue with their mission, which is to do terrible things\".</p> <p>I still wanted to ask her what she thought of Iran, and about elections in Iraq, but our time is up. She asks me whether my real name is Salam, and when I tell her my last name, the name of the tribe, she recognises it. I am left thinking: \"She knows - she really has been doing Iraq for 30 years\"</p> <p>Later ... I wait for five minutes outside the gates of the National Defence university, but not a single cab drives by. I decide to walk. Bad decision. Apparently, the university is located very close to what is probably Washington's Sadr City. I realise I have all the wrong instincts, I do not know what the bad or good signs are - it just looks very poor and, just like in Sadr City, lots of men who seem to have nothing to do stand at street corners.</p> <p>I remember having an argument with a taxi driver in Baghdad some time ago. He was totally convinced that there is no such thing as a poor American - they were all rich. Come take a look at this, habibi. It gets worse, Allah decides to drain his swimming pool and it starts raining. I realise I have forgotten the piece of paper with the address for my next appointment. I pray David Kay is not the punctual type.</p> <p>Kay agreed to meet me for lunch at a place of my choice. All I know is the bagel place near the hotel. I call a Guardian correspondent here in DC for help and she suggests I go to the Palm. \"It is a place men like to go to.\" She has no idea how intimidating this sounds to me - what is a place men like to go to? And what if I don't like it - will my membership card to the male species be withdrawn? </p> <p>The insecurities this sentence brought up: well, we don't want to go there. After a couple of ahhhs and ummms from me, she adds, \"Salam, it is not a strip joint\".</p> <p>When I get back to the hotel to pick up the address, I still have some time to check the restaurant's website. \"The spot for negotiating and deal-making over a juicy steak and an infamous Palm martini. It's not only politicians that make their way to the Washington Palm - Larry King and Tim Russert can be seen among the hordes of loyal Palm customers.\" </p> <p>Yup. Not a strip joint. When I get there, I am led past the nice tables near the windows to a small table in the back. Obviously, I should have said that I am internet celebrity Salam Pax, and I want to sit near Larry King. The place is very noisy and the waiters wear white aprons, making them look like medical assistants in a dental clinic. </p> <p>The first thing Dr David Kay says when he arrives is that this is the perfect place for an intimate conversation -- no one can ever hear what you are saying. We don't have the \"infamous martinis\" - he has an iced tea and I have a cola.</p> <p>The first time Kay was in Baghdad was back in 1992, heading the Unscom's nuclear weapons inspection team. Most recently, he was sent to Baghdad as chief weapons inspector for the Iraq Survey Group, which was dispatched to Iraq by the US to clarify the whole question of whether there were WMD there. </p> <p>He came back to Washington saying that he did not find \"large stockpiles of newly produced weapons of mass destruction\", blowing away the main argument that justified the war on Iraq: Saddam and his deadly arsenal of WMD.</p> <p>Although Kay has been quite often to Baghdad, he never met Saddam or his (late) sons. But because he was the head of the UN inspection team, he was constantly escorted by 10 Iraqi minders - warm Iraqi hospitality, courtesy of Saddam. While Kay was in Baghdad for the ISG inspections, he got to meet Tariq Aziz, Iraq's ex-minister of foreign affairs, now in custody. </p> <p>Aziz described a Saddam who was not as the rest of the world pictured him, but closer to the reality we Iraqis knew. \"He was only interested in self enrichment and staying in power. [Aziz] talked about Saddam sending him manuscripts for novels he was writing.\" </p> <p>Yes that sounds like the Saddam of the last couple of years, before this war. Reality came to him filtered through his aides. He was more interested in building palaces and monuments than fighting a war or planning terrorist attacks. I mean, one day the guy has a dream, and the next day he holds a meeting that's broadcast on TV in which he wants artists to interpret this dream as a sculpture to adorn one of the public squares in Baghdad. The dream? Dogs are running after him and he kills one of them. Seriously.</p> <p>What Kay found was a corrupt system in which scientists would exaggerate about what they were doing to get loads of money from Saddam. The scientists bluffed Saddam, and Saddam bluffed the world.</p> <p>So what does the man who started his statement to a US Senate committee with the words \"it turns out we were all wrong\" think about the war and the reasons it was fought? </p> <p>\"What I worry about is that, years from now, we will have an Iraqi historian who will say: 'The only reason the US and UK went to war was for oil, WMD and Israel. They never cared about what Saddam did to Iraqis.' That is what we should have done. It does not matter whether he had the weapons. Saddam was destroying society.\"</p> <p>We talk for a long time about the changes in Iraq, about the green zone and soldiers having to police traffic in the chaotic streets of Baghdad. He tells me how he watched sentiments change in Baghdad by how the Iraqi children and US soldiers interacted. </p> <p>We have coffee, and he asks what life is like these days in Baghdad, and what people think of our new prime minister, Ayad Allawi. I stopped taking notes some time ago - you can't have a conversation when you have to constantly write things down. But it is past three, and Dr Kay has to go.</p> <p>I tell you, this trip has been creating more confusion than answers. I spend the rest of the afternoon in a place which is much easier to deal with - the alphabetised aisles of a record store (result: the Peter Malick Group featuring Norah Jones).</p>",
  "Arms control negotiations always fascinate the experts; but rarely catch the popular imagination. So it was a singular coup that an unauthorised, secret stroll in the foothills of the Jura mountains near Geneva in 1982 by two arms control negotiators should have inspired a critically acclaimed play, Walk In The Woods, which was performed in New York and London and was even translated into German. <p>One of the diplomats involved was a Russian arms negotiator, Yuli Kvitsinsky. But the one who had taken the initiative, causing apoplexy in Washington, because it offered concessions on cutting medium-range nuclear missiles way beyond anything that the administration's hardliners were prepared to concede, was Paul Nitze, the American public servant emeritus who has died at the age of 97. One of the authors, on the US side, of the cold war, he was also among the first to seek its end.</p> <p>Nitze had walked off the range because, as he said months later, if he had sought approval in Washington, \"they would still be talking about it now\". Not one to blow his own trumpet, Nitze might have added that he had not felt bound by bureaucracy because he always felt secure enough in himself to afford independence of mind and of action.</p> <p>There is no single label to fit Nitze. This slim, silver-haired, courteous man was the ultimate Washington insider, one of the small handful of Americans who chose public service rather than politics and achieved positions of great influence. He shaped US foreign and security policies from 1940 onwards, working for both Democratic and Republican presidents through to the first Bush administration, and remained in the limelight almost to the end.</p> <p>Nitze was a Democrat, but for much of the cold war his hawkish views were more in line with mainstream Republican thinking. He plotted US nuclear policy throughout the era of \"mutually assured destruction\". But Nitze was also ahead of many of his contemporaries from the early 1980s onwards, when he became convinced that the two superpowers should embark on radical arms cuts. He mastered every nook and cranny of nuclear strategic thinking, but was sharply critical of President Reagan's Star Wars initiative: he did not share the widely held view that the costly race to develop nuclear defence system was justified.</p> <p>In 1950, under Truman, he had been the principal author of a key foreign policy document, NSC 68, adopted in 1950, which went far beyond his immediate boss, George Kennan's advocacy of containment. Nitze made dramatic assumptions about the Soviet Union's military build-up and war plans, which led the US to commit itself to a huge acceleration of the arms race to deter a first strike from Moscow.</p> <p>Afterwards, Nitze helped negotiate every significant nuclear arms control treaty, but resigned from the Nixon administration's Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Salt 1) and its companion, the 1972 ABM missile defence treaty.</p> <p>\"The depressing reality of Watergate,\" Nitze complained, had undermined his ability to drive a hard bargain with the Russians. He went on to form the Committee of Present Dangers, which lobbied successfully against ratification of the second Salt Treaty, and forced President Carter to withdraw it. Yet he later returned as chief nuclear arms negotiator for President Reagan, and was with him in Reykjavik in 1986, when they almost committed themselves to scrap nuclear weapons altogether.</p> <p>Nitze, in his first adult incarnation, was a businessman and banker, who had made himself financially independent by the time he was 30. The young man was now free to get on with the ambition he had formed at the age of 12: \"To be in a position where I could participate in world events and be close to the levers of power.\"</p> <p>Born in Amherst, Massachusetts,he was the son of an academic father of German descent. Listening to his parents and their university friends discuss world affairs, the young boy had concluded that \"distinguished scholarship did not appear to offer the opportunity\" of influencing events.</p> <p>An economics and finance graduate of Harvard, Nitze first went into banking, but he did not hesitate when, in 1940, his Wall Street colleague, Jim Forrestal, asked him to join him in Washington on President Roosevelt's staff. He was to remainanchored to the pinnacles of power in the US administration for the rest of his life, even though he never achieved cabinet rank, and never headed either the state department or the Pentagon.</p> <p>Nitze was not all public man. He had an intense enjoyment of social life in the upper stratospheres of American society; he was an excellent tennis player, loved riding and was adept at poker - an ability he put to use in his negotiations with the Russians. He was happily married for close on 40 years to Phyllis Pratt, a Standard Oil heiress. But after Phyllis's death, he remarried in 1992. His second wife, Leezee, a long-standing friend, was less than half his age, and he always claimed that she gave him a new lease of life.</p> <p>Paul Nitze wrote his own epitaph at the conclusion of his autobiography, From Hiroshima To Glasnost: \"I have wrestled with the issues of war and peace...

Due diligence on Doulton has already been completed but Waterford warned certain matters remained to be resolved and so there could be \"no certainty a formal offer will be made\". </p> <p>Anthony O'Reilly, the chairman of Waterford and proprietor of the Independent newspaper, told the company's annual meeting that the acquisition of Doulton would transform both sides. </p> <p>\"With Doulton's restructuring largely completed, we could add Royal Doulton's revenues to our top line sales without greatly increasing our costs. This could increase the profitability of the combined businesses,\" he said. </p> <p>Waterford already holds a 21.16% stake in Doulton while Mr O'Reilly and his deputy, Peter John Goulandris, own a further 3.99% of the shares in Doulton between them. </p> <p>The Doulton board said it would recommend the Wedgwood offer subject to the various issues being resolved. </p> <p>Stoke-based Doulton recently managed to cut interim operating losses from \u00a37.8m to \u00a35.7m - but at a cost. </p> <p>In March it announced the closure of its Nile Street factory in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, with the loss of 525 jobs. </p> <p>In future the company said it planned to keep just 2% of Royal Doulton production in Britain, thereby pretty much ending a 200-year tradition of making its English-style bone china in this country. </p> <p>Waterford has had its own difficulties, announcing in June it had turned a \u20ac7m profit into a \u20ac45m full-year loss and pulping the dividend. </p> <p>Wedgwood blamed adverse exchange rates and weaker demand for its difficulties, but it, too, has closed two British earthenware plants and switched output to China. </p> <p>The Waterford rights issue - on the basis of five new shares for each existing three shares at \u20ac0.06 - is to be fully underwritten by a company controlled 70% by Mr O'Reilly and Mr Goulandris, plus 30% by Davy Stockbrokers. </p> <p>The fundraising price represents a 53% discount to Wednesday night's closing valuation of the company. </p> <p>Mr O'Reilly admitted that the past three years had been \"turbulent\" and \"disappointing,\" but said over the past six months, management had put in place important foundations for future growth. </p> <p>\"The fact that the O'Reilly and Goulandris family are underwriting most of the rights issue is proof positive of our belief in Waterford Wedgwood and its world-class portfolio of products,\" he added. </p> <p>Both companies have been struggling against overcapacity in the industry. </p> <p>But rising interest rates, slow growth in salaries and a potential fall in consumer confidence have been seen by Doulton as putting a brake on British sales. </p> <p>The company, founded by Sir Henry Doulton, makes china tableware, decorative figurines, crystal and glassware under brands such as Minton and Royal Albert. In recent times it has cut 1,100 jobs and closed 42 shops. </p> <p>Waterford likes to describe itself as the world's leading \"luxury lifestyle group\", and was formed in 1986 by the merger of its Waterford crystal business with the Wedgwood ceramics operation.</p>",
  "<p>I have always thought of my writing On the Waterfront not as a conventional movie assignment, but as a mission. Pro-labour all my life I was drawn to the cause of the New York-New Jersey longshoremen from the moment I read Malcolm Johnson's shocking revelation of the evil axis of crime-ridden dockworkers' union racketeers and the supposedly respectable shipping and stevedore companies. That was in the late 1940s, when I was just winding up several years of working on my novel, The Disenchanted, and looking for new projects to undertake.</p> <p>At that vulnerable moment I was visited at my farm in Pennsylvania by a young man who had never produced a feature film before - Joe Curtis (a nephew of the foul-mouthed Columbia Studio boss, Harry Cohn), and the veteran German director Robert Siodmak, best known for his gripping Ernest Hemingway film, The Killers. They had optioned Malcolm Johnson's Pulitzer prizewinning series in the New York Sun and wanted me to join them as filmwriter and co-producer.</p> <p>Taking my cue from Malcolm Johnson, I went down to see Father John Corridan at the Xavier Labour School, in Hell's Kitchen on the lower west side of Manhattan. Johnson had cited this crusading labour priest as a prime source of his explosive expose of cold-blooded murders and brutal exploitation of the 25,000 dock workers serving America's greatest port.</p> <p>I found this feisty Jesuit priest filling the vacuum left by the labour union thugs who were union leaders in name only, hardened criminals who controlled the docks as their private preserve, where they could steal, extort and murder to their black hearts' content, while corrupt city and law enforcement officials looked the other way. Gathered around Father Corridan was a gutsy group of Irish rebel longshoremen he was guiding in a protest movement that would build to a harbour-wide reform labour union and would eventually challenge the bruisers who called themselves the International Longshoremen's Association.</p> <p>Fascinated by these men, I began to make Xavier my second home. While I was taking copious notes for the screenplay, Father Corridan encouraged me to use my prestige as a nationally known novelist to bring the longshoremen's plight to the attention of the metropolitan public who didn't have a clue as to what was happening to these men on whose labours they depended for everything they ate, wore and used. Despite Johnson's original breakthrough series, the city's newspapers, from the august New York Times to the lurid tabloids, ignored the rampant waterfront crimes as if they were happening on another planet.</p> <p>By this time I had drafted my screenplay, Crime on the Waterfront and submitted it to Harry Cohn, who rejected it as \"communistic\". Discouraged, Curtis and his director, Siodmak, dropped out and I acquired the rights to Johnson's provocative material. At this point, there was a changing of the guards. Into the picture came the famous director, Elia Kazan, whom I had never met but who showed up at my farm to suggest that we do a film together in the east, independent of Hollywood, and with a social theme. That appealed to me and I dug out my rejected screenplay, which Kazan liked.</p> <p>So I plunged in again, revising the screenplay according to heady conferences with Kazan. Mine was a two-pronged attack on the waterfront problem, because my first article for the New York Times - Joe Docks: Forgotten Man on the Waterfront - which laid out all the indignities inflicted on the dockworkers by their pistol union and its white-collar ally, the New York Shipping Association, received such favourable attention that I was encouraged to write another. How One Pier (#45) Got Rid of the Mob, led to half-a-dozen pieces in various papers and magazines, including the Saturday Evening Post and the liberal Catholic Commonweal.</p> <p>At the same time I was finessing my screenplay for Kazan, who owed 20th Century Fox honcho Darryl Zanuck a picture (he had already won him an Oscar there for Gentlemen's Agreement). He was sure \"DZ will love it\". Having been raised in Hollywood, and knowing its reluctance to embrace blue-collar, hard-hitting material, I had my doubts. Those doubts became powerful realities when Zanuck dismissed my screenplay with words that stabbed my heart: \"What you've written is exactly what America doesn't want to see. All you've got is a lot of sweaty longshoremen.\" Instead, Zanuck tried to persuade Kazan to direct a cinemascope version of the popular newspaper cartoon, Prince Valiant.</p> <p>When every other major studio turned us down, I was ready to retreat to my farm and write it as a novel, which I eventually did. Meanwhile, to my eternal gratitude, Kazan said he was determined to do it \" ... if I have to get a hand-held camera, use actors from Actors Studio working for scale and shoot it myself on the docks\". He was saved from that dire extreme when the independent freebooter, Sam Spiegel (who then fancied himself as SP Eagle), came to our rescue, offering to raise the money if Kazan would restrict himself to a B-budget of $800,000 on a 35-day schedule.</p> <p>In sub-zero weather in Hoboken, New Jersey, Kazan shot the film, heroically, in documentary style with a powerhouse Actors Studio cast of Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Lee J Cobb, Rod Steiger and, in her film debut, Eva Marie Saint. Even the one-line bit players were gifted actors from the Studio.</p> <p>When it was finished, Harry Cohn, who had reluctantly financed the picture, walked out at the end of his projection room screening without even saying goodnight to Kazan. \"He hates it,\" my loyal collaborator reported to me. And Marlon (who gave the greatest of all his great performances in this one) walked out on it too, with a terse conclusion: \"In and out. In and out.\"</p> <p>All the way through, Kazan and I had kept saying, like whistling in the dark: \"We don't care. We like it.\"</p> <p>That it would go on to win all those Oscars, score at the box office, be hailed as one of the top 10 of all time, was beyond our rosiest dreams. And even better than the Oscars, for me, was Father Corridan's assertion that once the public saw the brutal reality of a \"shape-up\", an assault on human dignity that had been banned on the London docks more than half a century before, the inhuman New York shape-up hiring method would be abolished, too. As, indeed, it was, followed by the establishment of the Corridan-recommended and film-reinforced Bi-State Waterfront Commission to impose some sense of law on what had become a lawless frontier.</p> <p>While we were rewarded with Oscars and all those accolades, Father Corridan was rewarded by being banished to Syracuse, as far away from the waterfront as the church hierarchy could get him. But that's another story. When he died in 1984, virtually forgotten, I was asked to give the eulogy for his funeral Mass at Fordham University.</p> <p>When I visited Kazan at his home last fall, on the eve of his 94th birthday, the first thing my feisty old compadre said to me was: \"God damn it Budd. Zanuck wouldn't give us shit!\" Fifty years later and he's still pissed. I laughed and embraced him and he said: \"Budd, why don't we sit down and run it again. We did some good work together.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On the Waterfront screens at the Odeon West End on October 23 as part of the London Film Festival. Tickets: 020 7928 3232</p>",
  "<p>The Corporation is a polemical documentary based on a book which, I confess, I have never heard of, called The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power. The core thesis of the film is that businesses are bad, very bad, and corporations, if they were people, would be regarded as \"pathological\". According to the film, corporations harm workers, harm human health, harm animals and harm the biosphere. And - sin of sins - they produce and market goods and services that people buy but don't really need.</p> <p>You would have to have a very blind spot indeed not to acknowledge that some companies behave badly. Indeed the film's coverage of a dairy milk-enhancing hormone called Prosilac (manufactured by Monsanto) raised some very apposite questions about the safety of the product. Checking and questioning the activities and claims made by business, especially where there are health and safety considerations, is a valuable and necessary exercise.</p> <p>But the problem with this film is that, because it never acknowledges that companies can do anything right or have any positive impact on people's lives, any constructive questioning of business's behaviour gets lost in the thicket. The film cries wolf so often, and in such self-righteous tones, that I, for one, began to discount everything that was said. Which is unfortunate, as it limits the potential audience. This will probably be a film that will be utterly adored by anti-capitalist and anti-globalising zealots, thus preaching to the converted, but ignored by everyone else.</p> <p>It would have helped the film if they had started by giving some serious thought as to what business is and what it does for people. Businesses are usually defined as profit-generating organisations (otherwise they go bust) that sell goods and services to independent and responsible consumers who want to buy them. In doing so, they also create jobs, generate income and create the wealth that sustains higher living standards. They are therefore defined as having a very limited set of activities. These strike me as positive things.</p> <p>But the film is never explicit about what it means about business. Instead it prefers to make the usual, sadly predictable, noises about the inherent wickedness of making profits and is sniffily patronising about the gullibility of consumers. Incidentally, why are middle-class anti-capitalists so patronising about everyone else?</p> <p>Throughout the film, I kept asking myself what economic vision the film-makers wished to impose on the hapless public. One where all businesses are bankrupt and there were no jobs? Or a pre-industrial world in which we all sit under a tree recycling seeds (there were some touching shots of this in the film)? Or one where there was public ownership of the means of production and no nasty capitalists? The latter option, as we all know, has been utterly discredited with the collapse of the USSR and satellite economies. (The Soviet economy was, incidentally, far more damaging to the world's biosphere than any capitalist economy.) The film, quite simply, provides no answers. It is clear that capitalism is the worst way of running an economy - until you see the others.</p> <p>The film also seemed fashionably unhappy with the notion that companies should be accountable to their shareholders, instead of to the broad church of their \"stakeholders\". This is a frequently expressed concern that I simply fail to understand. Shareholders invest their savings, including their pensions, in companies. Surely, therefore, it is appropriate that company directors should be primarily motivated by the objective of providing the owners (the shareholders) with the best possible return.</p> <p>Shareholder accountability does not, however, mean that businesses ignore their other \"stakeholders\". On the contrary, employers, at least in developed countries, have legally specified responsibilities towards the other stakeholders. As well as very extensive employment and health and safety legislation, employers have a duty of care to their employees. There are, quite rightly, tough environmental laws. Businesses also have responsibilities towards their consumers and suppliers.</p> <p>According to the film-makers, corporations aren't just concerned with profit (\"pathologically\"), they are also concerned with power (also \"pathologically\"). It is obvious that successful companies, especially large multinationals, have \"power\" in the marketplace and it is equally obvious that they can have political \"power\" in government and international circles. Moreover, they can abuse this political power and such abuse needs thorough questioning and exposure. In forthcoming months let us hope we see more about the role of French and Russian oil companies in the UN oil-for-food programme in Iraq.</p> <p>But this film is not interested in specific misdemeanours. Instead, like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, it tilts at the \"oppressive giants sent by evil enchanters\" of its own imagination - the corporations.</p> <p>What the film simply fails to acknowledge is that corporations do not function in a vacuum of their own creation. They all exist within sovereign nation states, with their own governments and own laws. If these sovereign countries decide that they do not want them within their national boundaries, they can tell them to leave. This applies to Shell in Nigeria as well as to the many manufacturing companies that have set up in China and Indonesia.</p> <p>But when the film discusses the \"exploitation\" (sic) of developing countries by the multinationals, it never stops to ask why governments permit multinationals to invest in their countries. It doesn't ask why, because the answer would be deeply embarrassing. Governments want them there to raise living standards and help their countries grow out of poverty - a poverty that our comfortable western, middle-class anti-capitalists would, incidentally, find deeply unpleasant. The attitude of the film-makers, all from affluent western countries, towards developing countries is deeply patronising. The suggestion is that they know more about them than the people who actually live there. It's grotesque.</p> <p>This film is a missed opportunity. Companies are not all squeaky clean but, rather than target genuine corporate misdemeanours, it splatters bullets all over the wall and misses the miscreants.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ruth Lea is a former director of policy at the Institute of Directors and is now director of the Centre for Policy Studies.

  "<p>Stewart Downing came off the bench after a dreadful first half to strike the winning goal as Middlesbrough got their Group E campaign off to a successful start against the Greek minnows Egaleo in Athens. </p> <p>Steve McClaren expressed satisfaction with the way his side had begun the group stage. \"It's a perfect start for us,\" he said. \"Going in at half-time we knew we could win it in the second half and so it proved because we had players on the bench who could come on and get the winner for us. </p> <p>\"For me tonight was a perfect European performance in the fact it was a clean sheet and we scored the vital goal.\" </p> <p>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was a surprise absentee from the Middlesbrough starting line-up as McClaren shuffled his squad. </p> <p>The weakened Middlesbrough side produced an instantly forgettable opening half and it was Egaleo who threatened first after 10 minutes when Georgios Fotakis's free-kick was pushed wide by Mark Schwarzer. </p> <p>It took Boro 20 minutes to register their first meaningful attempt, with the Dutch winger Boudewijn Zenden sending a 20-yard effort tamely wide of the left-hand post. Then Giannis Chloros had Boro's defenders worried with a dangerous low cross which Schwarzer collected bravely, and after 26 minutes Zenden's speculative volley curled wide of Mahamadou Sidibe's post. </p> <p>The best chance of the first 45 minutes arrived two minutes before half-time as Chloros surged down the right flank and squared across the face of the area for the on-rushing Giorgos Barkoglou to try his luck, but the left-winger's powerful shot flew inches wide to Schwarzer's left. </p> <p>McClaren sent on Gaizka Mendieta at the interval at the expense of James Morrison in an effort to bring some guile to a midfield which had huffed and puffed its way through the first half. And a clear indication of the manager's growing desperation for a goal came with 20 minutes to go when he ended Mark Viduka's miserable night and sent on Hasselbaink, also replacing Zenden with Downing. </p> <p>It proved to be an inspired move as it brought the goal Middlesbrough craved - though not from the source McClaren would have expected. When Ray Parlour broke through the inside-right channel he rolled a pass across the penalty area and Downing drilled a shot inside the far post with his left foot. </p> <p>\"He [Downing] continues his progress. He's got ability - he's showed it again tonight,\" McClaren said. </p> <p>The home side seemed stunned after the goal and it was Boro who assumed control as the contest entered the final 10 minutes. </p>",
  "<p>It could be simple coincidence that Zurich has chosen the eve of a Heineken Cup campaign to indicate the company will not be renewing its sponsorship of the Premiership after 2005-06. Major companies do not always scour fixture lists before making cutbacks but the truth is that Europe's elite club tournament is starting to make everything else feel like small beer. </p> <p>Across the continent, from Biarritz via Bath to Ballymena, most rugby supporters and players now have a similar gut feeling, give or take the occasional Frenchman who prefers ruling the domestic roost to conquering Europe. More than ever, the Heineken Cup is becoming rugby's version of the Champions League. </p> <p>It is debatable this season whether more than 10 of the 24 competing sides have any realistic chance of making it to the Murrayfield final. But such is the level of anticipation among those involved before tonight's opening matches that any mild Euro-scepticism melts away faster than a curling rink on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. </p> <p>Take Wasps, last season's champions, who are in the least forgiving pool alongside Leicester and Biarritz. It is the opinion of Warren Gatland, the Wasps director of rugby, and England's Josh Lewsey that big European games are not only on a par with full-scale Tests but, in certain cases, superior to them. </p> <p>\"The standard and intensity is better than most international matches,\" says Lewsey. \"The Premiership is fantastic but this is your Champions League.\" </p> <p>So what is the secret to winning the big one? English clubs have triumphed in four of the past five seasons, the exception being two years ago when Toulouse beat Perpignan. The first essential is continent-wide: no one will win the European Cup without first topping their pool. </p> <p>Every year, without fail, this law holds true, proving a home quarter-final draw is an absolute necessity. At Wasps they insist last year's keynote game was not the final against Toulouse, nor the never-to-be-forgotten semi-final against Munster. Instead the contest that set the tone was the away pool win in Perpignan, when Wasps proved to everyone, not least themselves, they could achieve just about anything. </p> <p>Hence the reason why teams who start sluggishly in autumn never triumph in May. One lost pool game could be the difference between a juicy home draw in the knockout stages and a doom-laden trip to Toulouse or Leicester. </p> <p>Mental strength is a crucial component, as is a sense of brotherhood. \"You don't win the Heineken Cup without feeling you belong to something,\" confirms Lewsey. \"When the pressure's on you're willing to die for each other and the clubs who have that tend to do well.\" </p> <p>In that sense, Wasps' pool is not a complete disaster. As Lawrence Dallaglio observes: \"If you don't play tough games early it doesn't bode well for later in the competition.\" </p> <p>The bad news is that three evenly matched teams in the same group decrease the chances of a second qualifier sneaking through among the best runners-up. And if any side will be unfazed by a visit to High Wycombe it is Leicester, who are currently assembling what insiders feel may be a better side than the rabble who won two successive European titles. </p> <p>Whoever prevails there should be a heavyweight last eight. A list comprising Leicester, Bath, Toulouse, Munster, Perpignan, Stade Fran\u00e7ais, Leinster and Gloucester would be no surprise, assuming the Welsh provinces do not muscle their way into contention. </p> <p>In the meantime, Heineken's position as title sponsor beyond this season remains uncertain, and ERC representatives are sounding out the marketplace. Maybe those clever people at Zurich have a cunning plan.</p>",
  "<p>There is a Ladbrokes betting shop not far from Trafalgar Square which the average pedestrian could easily pass without realising that it was, in fact, a betting shop. All you can see through the big picture window at the front is a cafe bar serving coffees and cakes, and tables with clean white table cloths. </p> <p>In fact, people often walk in and sit down and still do not realise where they are. \"I've been in there myself and seen it happen,\" Chris Bell, the chief executive of Ladbrokes, said yesterday. \"They sit down and order a cappuccino and a sandwich, and it's only then that they suddenly realise it's a betting shop. But the interesting thing is that they don't suddenly put down their cappuccino and run out.\" </p> <p>The shop in question is very much an experiment and not the first sign of an imminent corporate policy. None the less, as senior industry executives such as Bell digest the implications of the government's gambling bill, the text of which was published on Tuesday, similar attempts to pull large new audiences into betting shops seem certain. </p> <p>Much of the coverage since the bill was published has focused on proposals to allow Las Vegas-style \"supercasinos\" to open their doors across Britain. However, traditional bookmakers also fall within the wide scope of the bill, and expect their market to change significantly as a result. </p> <p>Bell, for one, seems confident that the bill will reverse the long-standing decline in the overall number of betting shops in Britain. </p> <p>\"It's no secret that we're looking to expand, when the locations are right and the prices are right,\" he said. \"We have a few concerns about some details [of the bill], for instance over the regulation of betting exchanges, but in the round it should be good for us and the whole industry.\" </p> <p>A standard feature of most Vegas casinos is the sports book, where odds are offered on all manner of sporting events, and coverage is beamed in live, 24 hours a day. Similar sports books are expected to feature in new casinos in Britain, providing even more competition for the punters' money, but not to an extent that has the major bookies' worried. </p> <p>\"Obviously the casinos will now offer betting, but the existing casino footprint is very small,\" Bell says. </p> <p>Internet operators such as betting exchanges are also realistic about their chances of usurping the shops in the near future. For the exchanges, though, the most significant aspect of the gambling bill is what it does not contain. </p> <p>There is no mention of further regulation of individual clients of exchanges, or any attempt to define - and tax - the so-called non-recreational layers. These are the clients who, in the jealous eyes of traditional bookies at least, act as bookmakers themselves but without needing to apply for a permit. </p> <p>\"Betting shops are part of the fabric of British life, like pubs and everything else on the high street,\" Antonia Sharpe, senior communications executive for Betfair, the largest exchange, said yesterday. \"Increasing access to the internet will probably cause growth in online business, but the shops are still buoyant. Everyone seems to be buying them at the moment.\" The exchanges will remain vigilant as the legislation passes through the house, though, since the traditional bookmakers have not given up hope of adding further strictures on exchanges to the bill. </p> <p>\"The government rejected many of the proposals [on exchanges] from the [Parliamentary] joint scrutiny committee, in particular on how to define non-recreational users. But even so it's still too early to say how it might turn out,\" said Sharpe.</p>",
  "<p>The England and Wales Cricket Board is to offer counties cash bonuses for fielding England-qualified players in domestic competitions in an effort to combat the steadily rising influx of foreign players. </p> <p>At present, European legislation allows counties to circumvent regulations and field cricketers not qualified for England who would otherwise be prevented from playing by a rule restricting them to two overseas players. </p> <p>Now an annual subsidy per county of around \u00a31.3m will include incentives. Although the precise amounts are not likely to be disclosed until the end of the year when the ECB budget is approved, it is believed the handouts as they stand will be cut by up to \u00a350,000, which will then be redistributed according to certain criteria. These relate to players qualified for England at various levels, the qualifications of coaching staff and the successful implementation and management of an academy. </p> <p>The ECB has also blocked the indiscriminate employment of overseas players as a stop-gap measure. Currently a county is entitled to replace an overseas player who is subsequently required by their national side or gets injured. It has led to numerous short-term signings of whom some, such as the Australian Glenn McGrath who played briefly for Middlesex last summer, remain under the direct control of their home union. This can be both expensive and detrimental to the development of England-qualified players. </p> <p>With effect from the 2006 season, however, all overseas players and prospective substitutes must be nominated before July 1 and there will be no substitutes for injury and no substitutes for substitutes. More than 30 players appeared in county competitions last year while neither being qualified for England nor registered as overseas players. Of these a high proportion came from the southern hemisphere but held British passports because of residency or ancestry. </p> <p>Others, such as the former Zimbabwe Test player Grant Flower, who will be at Essex next season, have qualified through the Kolpak ruling - a case brought to the European court by Maros Kolpak, a Slovakian handball player who wished to play in Germany - which makes it illegal to discriminate against those from countries which have reciprocal trade agreements with the European Union, providing they have a work permit. </p> <p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p> <p>The number of a county's players who have played for England </p> <p>The number of under-23 England-qualified players </p> <p>The number of England-qualified contracted players in major domestic competitions </p> <p>The level of qualification of coaching staff </p> <p>The number of players a county provides for England A and age-group sides </p> <p>The implementation and management of a county academy</p>"
