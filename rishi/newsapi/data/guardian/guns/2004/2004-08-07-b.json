  "Just how risky can it be, going to buy a hosepipe from a garden centre on a Sunday morning? I suppose a bag of compost could topple off a shelf, or you could trip over a rake as you check out the lobelia. Anyway, for me it turned out the danger lay in the car park. <p>As I emerged, hosepipe under the arm, two men were looking suspiciously at my car. I saw them circling it, then peering into its interior. Falteringly, I asked them what was the matter. It turned out these strangers had just tried in vain to stop an enormous 4X4 reversing into the back of my car, and then driving away at high speed. </p> <p>The good samaritans had then taken down the number plate and noted the damage, which was only a smashed light. Full of gratitude, I resolved to report it immediately. It could have been much worse, but it seemed to me that the other driver couldn't have known that at the time, and anyway, should have stopped. </p> <p>But telling the police about it turned out to be a much tougher task than it initially appeared. I rang the local control room who told me that I needed to go to Richmond police station in person, with a copy of my MOT, to give the details. </p> <p>Richmond used to have the kind of station featured in the original version of The Ladykillers, where the genteel character played by Katie Johnson totters in to have a friendly chat with the sergeant. Of course, it hasn't been like that for quite a while (probably about 70 years) thanks to the changing nature of its clientele. But it changed big-time five years ago, when they decided to downsize the station into a daytime only centre, by moving most of its work to Twickenham. </p> <p>Instead of having a front counter, the visitor is faced with a small room which can only be entered once a policeman has pressed a buzzer. There's a notice on the door, explaining that only one person at a time can be seen, and that each case will take a minimum of 20 minutes to report, and that you may face a fairly lengthy wait. You are then given the name of a website on which some crimes can be reported. </p> <p>I waited for 40 minutes, and then decided I had better get to work, and would come back the next day. I did so, and again, as there were three people ahead of me, I realised that I was due for at least a one-hour wait. Once in work, I tried to get onto the website but couldn't do so. </p> <p>By the time I finally came face to face with a policemen last Friday, my story of how my car was hit in the car park had taken on an epic quality in my mind. I could hear the noise of splintering glass, of the good neighbours peeping their horns to get the driver to stop. All of this was going to be related in detail to the officer. </p> <p>But no. He was young, kind and sympathetic but wanted only to give me a form to fill in, which I would then have to return at a later date, with my car insurance, MOT etc. 'So that's another hour-long wait,' I protested. 'Couldn't I post it to you?' Well, no, he explained, he had to see the accompanying documents. And this then had to go the traffic support unit, who would then take the right action but which might take 28 days to process. </p> <p>The opening sentence of the document begins: 'The purpose of this form is to reduce inconvenience to you.' I didn't feel this was entirely truthful, as the most convenient thing would have been to spend five minutes telling someone what had happened so they could then trace the driver. The form continued: 'Your co-operation also releases more officers for street patrol.' </p> <p>Far be it from me to tie up officers in pointless red tape, or take them off the streets of Richmond dealing with violent or aggressive drunks, but there had to be a more efficient system than this. </p> <p>It was such a little offence, so unimportant in the great scheme of things. There must be 100 crimes each day in my area which are far far more traumatic and disruptive, but it still didn't seem right that someone could go into your car and then drive off without taking any responsibility. </p> <p>MPs say the difficulties in reporting crime are a major concern and always take up a large part of discussions at local public meetings, but go completely unrecognised because so much of the argument at Westminster is about the policing of terrorism. </p> <p>Having faith in the police, like all public services, depends to a large extent on how you have found them in the past. A theft, criminal damage to a car, drunken behaviour on the street - all of these are police business just as much as the major crimes. And encouraging people to talk to officers is surely important. Another great public service, the NHS, has recently seen its patient satisfaction ratings start to climb, and it cannot be coincidence that the waits to see a GP, or a casualty doctor are far, far shorter than they were five years ago. Access to the professionals matters, it's what we find reassuring and, ultimately, it's why we retain our belief in citizenship.</p>",
  "The red mud glistens with recent rain, half-naked children play with the chickens that rush between the close-packed bamboo-walled huts and the women, their multicoloured umbrellas lurid against lush green foliage, walk past the young men lounging beneath the trees. <p>It is noon in Wat Thamkrabok camp and the 15,000 displaced tribespeople who live in the compound, 90 miles northeast of the Thai capital Bangkok, are sleeping, eating, talking, working and, above all, waiting. </p> <p>They are waiting to go to America. Within a year almost all the people in Wat Thamkrabok - many of whom have never travelled farther than a few miles from the camp in their lives - will be flown to new homes in California, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In three weeks the first major charter flight is scheduled to depart. Few of the refugees will ever return. </p> <p>They come from the Hmong hill tribes of Laos who were recruited by the CIA to fight the North Vietnamese, but after the communists seized control of Laos many were forced out of their villages. A small group of Hmong still maintain a campaign of insurgency from high in the hills of the isolated south-east Asian state. </p> <p>For men like Yang Pua Ba, 42, memories of the Vietnam conflict are still fresh. Ba's father fought the North Vietnamese, and Ba remembers what happened to the family when they were stranded by the US withdrawal. </p> <p>'We fled to the jungle and then crossed into Thailand. We lived in different camps and then came here 10 years ago,' he says. </p> <p>Ba and his 15 children are headed for Wisconsin. 'We have relatives who live in America who say it is a decent life there. But I am worried about getting a job and getting my children into school,' he told The Observer . </p> <p>Tsong, 37, the mother of seven of Ba's children, is keen to go. Her 17-strong family live in a one-room bamboo hut with a corrugated-iron roof and an outside toilet. They sleep on thin straw mats, cook over coke braziers and struggle to eke out a living stitching and selling clothes. Their neighbours live just feet away. </p> <p>'There is nothing here. It's impossible to get any land or a proper education for the children,' Tsong said. 'In America, we can get by.' She admits she is worried. 'We are not very well educated people so it could be difficult to get jobs, and we have a lot of mouths to feed. And I have no idea of how to drive a car.' </p> <p>Only 50 per cent of the camp's population can read or write Hmong, let alone English. They have lived in a mild tropical climate all their lives but many will be heading to St Paul, Minnesota, where winter temperatures can plunge to 20 degrees below zero. 'We tell them that snow looks like salt but that it is cold,' said one camp official. </p> <p>Half of the camp's inhabitants are under 14 and few know much about America. No newspapers reach the camp and there are no satellite TV dishes. The International Organisation for Migration, which is manag ing the extraordinarily complex logistics of the move, is running 'cultural orientation' classes. But resources are short and there are only 15 hours of lessons. </p> <p>Kaying Kay, 36, moved from Thailand to America in 1975. She has returned to teach the Hmong in Wat Thamkrabok camp how to cope. 'They ask if it is true that wives can leave their husbands and that no one in America respects their parents. Some have even heard that there are man-eating monsters in the US.' </p> <p>A manual has tips on dealing with neighbours and paying the rent on time. 'Americans are highly time conscious and often can account for every hour of the day,' it says. </p> <p>In a classroom, 40 Hmong are receiving the last of their lessons. On the walls are key words and concepts - many taken from a US refugee tuition package. They include 'self-marketing', 'freedom', 'equality' and 'individualism'. </p> <p>'I try to encourage them to think about rights and responsibilities,' said Kay. </p> <p>The refugees will be met by local voluntary organisations contracted by the American authorities. There will be substantial financial assistance from public funds and federal grants have been made available to aid assimilation. </p> <p>For the most part, the local reaction has been positive. The mayor of St Paul, Minnesota, where many of the refugees will end up, visited the camp in March to review the community's needs. Local papers have welcomed the newcomers. 'America is a land of immigrants,' said one. </p> <p>There are more than 200,000 'Hmong-Americans', many of whom arrived between 1979 and 1982, so most refugees have relatives who can help. They have assimilated well, but 38 per cent still live in poverty. 'They're definitely better off now than 10 years ago, but this is still a low-income, working-class population,' says Jeremy Hein, a professor at Wisconsin University. </p> <p>There are social problems including teenage prostitution among runaway Hmong girls, drug abuse and the growing cultural gaps between the older generations who remember Laos and young people who have known nothing but America. Though many families use traditional shamans and herbal medicine to help cure their children of illnesses they will also own a state-of-the-art computer. </p> <p>Many differences will be difficult to resolve. Yang Pua Ba has two wives - illegal in America but not among the Hmong. 'I'm sure we'll sort something out,' he said. </p> <p>Nor do all the 15,000 refugees in the camp want to go to America - although they have little choice. Many men do not want to go, though their wives do. Arguments frequently result in domestic violence. </p> <p>Tho Thon, 38, fled Laos in 1975. He has lived in Wat Thamkrabok for 10 years and will be leaving for the US soon. 'I am very sad to go to America,' he said. 'Maybe the United Nations or someone should have been involved. Then things might have been different and I might be able to go back to Laos. Now I know I will never see my homeland again.' </p> <p>Many of those in the camp have been offered resettlement before, but have refused to move. A sticking point has been that many Hmong did not want to give up their dreams of returning to their native land. </p> <p>However, the effective leader of the Hmong in America, Vang Pao, a former guerrilla leader, recently announced a plan for reconciliation with the communist government in Laos. </p> <p>The Thai government is keen to be rid of the Hmong. The refugees were given refuge at Wat Thamkrabok by local monks. The temple - or 'wat' - is better known for its drug rehabilitation pro gramme and its 'vomiting cure', recently undertaken by the Libertines' Pete Doherty. </p> <p>The military took over the administration of the camp last year alleging that it was used for widespread drug dealing. Colonel Bok, the camp commander, said that drug testing had found very high rates of opium use among older people and amphetamine use among the young, but arrests and education programmes had brought the problem under control. So, aid workers at the camp say, has the fact that a clear blood test is necessary to board the flights to America. </p> <p>The US is also keen to bring out the Hmong as increased security vetting has meant a shortfall in refugees. </p> <p>By early afternoon the cultural orientation classes are finished. Preparations are under way for a music festival in the evening. A tinny radio plays in the office of the Thai colonel in charge of the camp and the sound of Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Sweet Home Alabama' drifts out. </p> <p>Lists of names have been stuck to a board in the centre of the camp. Eight-year-old Konghong has never travelled farther than the school a mile or so outside the barbed-wire boundaries of the camp. 'I want to go to America. I want to study. It is a good life there and Americans are good people,' he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>George Melly, Nuts &amp; Son Of Nuts </strong><br>(Warner) </p> <p>Thirty years of not entirely well-behaved entertaining around the globe started with Nuts , recorded live at Ronnie Scott's in 1972. 'A night to remember for those who can. Some can't', as the notes have it. When the album came out, Melly chucked his job on this paper and hit the road. Everyone should have a George Melly CD in the house, for those moments when life gets a bit too solemn, and this is the one to have. Two, actually, because it's a double. It features the original Feet warmers, with Wally Fawkes (also formerly of this paper) on clarinet and Bruce Turner on alto saxophone, both playing beautifully, as does trumpeter John Chilton. George excels himself, especially in the title song, a masterpiece of single entendre. </p> <p><strong>Weather Report, I Sing The Body Electric</strong><br> (Columbia) </p> <p>Dating from 1972, this was Weather Report's second album, and the one that launched a whole new approach to what came to be known as 'fusion'. With the perspective of foreground and background in constant motion, and melodic lines melting into one another, the effect was indeed rather like speeded-up changes in the weather. The two dominant figures are Joe Zawinul at the keyboards and Wayne Shorter on tenor and soprano saxophones. If this CD sounds typical of its time, that's because its lead was soon followed by others. It retains a freshness that most of the imitators never had in the first place. </p> <p><strong>Ken Peplowski, Easy To Remember</strong><br> (Nagel Heyer) </p> <p>If you want to hear some masterly clarinet playing, listen to Peplowski's long, unaccompanied introduction to 'Everything I Love' on this CD. It will give you the shivers. His albums are always meticulously planned, with just the right mixture of the new and the familiar and little surprises dotted about. There are two here - the Paul McCartney song, 'Junk', prettily sung by Kim Liggett, and Bobby Short singing 'It's Easy To Remember'. But it is Peplowski's clarinet that dominates, even to the extent of overshadowing his own very good tenor saxophone playing.</p>",
  "The woman in the yellow shirt stood up and told of her life-long struggle against being fat, a fight that she had clearly lost. She was enormous. <p>'Every time I dieted I ended up larger,' she said as she broke into tears, 'If I were anorexic or bulimic, I would get sympathy. It is so frustrating.' She was applauded by 100 other very fat men and women. </p> <p>'Here, you are in an island of sanity,' said Professor Paul Campos, author of The Obesity Myth and speaker at this annual meeting of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (Naafa) - activists spurring the backlash against America's obsession with weight. </p> <p>Campos is their hero. His book has turned convention on its head, arguing that there is no obesity epidemic and fat does not have to mean unhealthy. His book has been a huge boost for association members who want an end to the obsession with weight and dieting and the marginalisation of fat people. </p> <p>And fat people are finally starting to win a few battles: Campos's book is rising in the lists and generating a media buzz; the Atkins diet is waning in popularity after its founder's premature death; and former Cheers star Kirstie Alley, whose weight is a tabloid obsession, has landed her own reality TV show, Fat Actress, which sees her weight as a positive choice, not a reason for horror. </p> <p>But Naafa is leading the charge. 'There are few more revolutionary groups in America today and revolution in this area is warranted,' said Campos. </p> <p>Founded in 1969, it has several thousand members worldwide. At its annual conference in Newark last week some members had travelled from Canada and Europe. Delegates sported name tags emblazoned with the message: Dream Big. </p> <p>Naafa hopes to provide a haven for very fat people away from the stresses of living in a thin society. At the conference were talks on how to lobby for fat rights, yoga classes, a pool party, a fashion show, a speed dating session, classes of beauty tips and fitness exercises. In short, they did most of the things that thinner people take for granted. </p> <p>Marilyn Wann, a co-director of the association, symbolises its attitude of be healthy and happy with the body you have. Her T-shirt asks loudly: 'Fat!So?'. She says figures blaming obesity for hundreds of thousands of premature deaths in America are wrong: 'Where are all the fat dead bodies?' </p> <p>She is appalled by the growing practice among the very obese to have part of their stomach removed in a bid to lose weight: 'That sort of surgery is simply stomach theft. Why would any human being need to have a healthy organ cut out?' </p> <p>Naafa encourages members to organise to lobby for legislation to fight discrimination against fat people. Carole Cullum, a Naafa director and lawyer said: 'It is up to us to fight. We are in a struggle.' </p> <p>Wann is more blunt: 'We are in the middle of a witch hunt and we are the witches.' She says that, like most Naafa members, she eats healthily and exercises regularly - yet is still fat. 'I mean, seriously, why would anyone choose to be this size in a society that hates them every hour of every day?' </p> <p>Doctors and healthcare professionals believe obesity has become a global epidemic - and America is at the heart of it. They point to evidence such as the rise in obesity-related diseases, like diabetes. Some studies have shown that 135 million Americans are overweight and the numbers classified as obese have risen 50 per cent over the past 10 years. </p> <p>The result has been panic. Makeover shows advocating plastic surgery are the latest television hit and bookshelves groan with the latest best-selling diets. In the Eighties, newspaper articles on obesity ran at about 60 a year; last year there were more than 7,000. </p> <p>Campos believes America, Britain and much of the developed world is in the grip of anti-fat hysteria. He blames much of this on how obesity is measured, claiming that the standards are unrealistic. </p> <p>He also claims dieting is responsible for making people fat by triggering a 'starvation response' in the body which, when dieting stops, starts storing 'emergency' fat in increasing amounts, a pattern repeated after each failed diet. </p> <p>That was the experience of Mary Ray Worley, 48, who as a chubby child started dieting at the age of eight - but each one only ended with her putting on more weight. Since discovering the association three years ago, she has changed her attitude to her weight: 'I don't hate my body any more. I honour it.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Sandra McCracken, Best Laid Plans</strong><br> (Shell) </p> <p>The initial impression of For the Roses-era Joni Mitchell created by the mournful piano and cello on the opener to Sandra McCracken's UK debut (her third album in the States) is soon supplanted by one of middle-of-the-road country rock as the single 'Last Goodbye' bursts in. Not that this is a bad thing; many will be enticed by the super-slick production of Peter Collins and McCracken's pure tones - at times reminiscent of an early Natalie Merchant. </p> <p>There is certainly charm in the complex, interweaving harmonies on tracks such as '500 Miles'. 'Letters', too, is a solid song with an attractive line in slide guitar and cello. The drippy cover of Peter Sarstedt's Seventies stalkathon, 'Where do you go to my Lovely', was probably not a good idea, however, and the album's post-9/11 soul-searcher, 'Age After Age', aspires to be Dylan's 'God on Our Side' but - in spite of a bare acoustic guitar backing - is actually knuckle-chewingly awful. </p> <p><strong>MAS, Mutual Admiration Society</strong> </p> <p>(Sugar Hill) </p> <p>Acoustic outfit MAS are Glen Phillips of Toad the Wet Sprocket and Sara and Sean Watkins and Chris Thile of Nickel Creek. This recording was made by Ethan Johns pretty much live over six days in 2000, and at least half a dozen of the songs are a product of 'The Game', where members of the group on tour would have to come up with, then polish and perform, a song a day. </p> <p>What should have been a haphazard process has in fact turned up a fine, coherent clutch of recordings, due in no small part to Phillips's excellent voice and Sara Watkins's winning way with a fiddle. The backings are a sparse but masterly mesh of acoustic guitar, mandolin and the lightest of keyboards (only once do we get anything approaching a full drumkit), and the songs tread the border between singer-songwriterly soul and country, in places very similar to Kurt Wagner's Lambchop. The opener, 'Comes a Time', is a slow-builder from the barest of starts; 'Be Careful' has a wonderful mandolin solo; and there's a blissed-out richness to MAS's version of Sean Kennedy's 'La Lune'. True, it's a shame the album's closing track, a cover of Harry Nilsson's 'Think About Your Troubles', has to descend into Hot Club jazz (Reinhardt and Grappelli MAS are not) but a bit of levity is forgivable in a song about sleeping with the fishes. It's nice to come across music that doesn't try too hard to tuck away its loose ends. </p> <p> <strong>Mobb Deep, Amerikaz Nightmare </strong> <br>(Jive) </p> <p>It's three years since the hardcore rap duo Havoc and Prodigy released their last album (Infamy), but the cooling-off period - apparently occasioned by record company red tape - seems to have been anything but. Their lyrics mostly involve guns, drugs and money, and issue unpleasant threats (including at least two to dump your body off a bridge) against fellow 'niggaz'. 'If I don't get you here I'll swing by your house,' claims the Thomas Dolby-sampling single, 'Got it Twisted', before the chorus concludes: 'Yo ass won't live to see tomorrow.' </p> <p>Annoyingly, however, the album is awash with great retro-electro beats and funky live drumming; spooky Eighties synth parts and catchy samples (check the cracked horns of 'Neva Change') are everywhere. So the depressing, corrosive call-to-arms of the lyrics is bound to leave an impression as the record sells through. Oh good. </p> <p><strong>Colour of Fire, Pearl Necklace </strong><br> (Riverman) </p> <p>The riffs may be resolutely metal, in a sixth-form sort of way, but there is much art and charm on York boys Colour of Fire's debut. This may be down to producer Steve Osborne, whose credits include New Order and U2; so while the influence of the recent garage and metal revivals is foremost, there are shades of Peter Hook in the bassline to current single 'The Exile' and of Bono in the becalmed verses of 'A Couple of Reasons'. The latter is a great exercise in light and shade, the screamed chorus breaking into a middle eight where a melancholy high vocal seeps over slow-building toms; 'Italics' comes on like full-on rawk then breaks down brilliantly to half-time; and 'Images of You' starts with a fine 16 bars of drumming before bare bass and understated picked electric build into slow, grungy rocker. There's definitely something of At the Drive-In about the centrepiece sneer of 'Pearl Necklace for Her Majesty'. That said, while quiet souls might feel riffed-out by the end of the record, plenty of other textures are visited along the way. </p> <p><strong>Bonemachine, Vent</strong></p> <p>(Hackpen) </p> <p>It's tempting, listening to a couple of the half-dozen songs on Portsmouth quartet Bonemachine's first outing, to see them as the south coast's substandard answer to Arab Strap. </p> <p>Simon Brookes's vocals may have more in common with a less tuneful Thom Yorke than with Malcolm Middleton, but the same bare bass and 909 beats underpin dark material just like the latter's. 'Coming Down' features a spoken narrative about obsession; 'Hold Me' is a tale of domestic abuse (sample lyric: 'This time I'll break some bones'). </p> <p>Yet after initial dullness the pace suddenly hots up with 'The Message', whose piano-and-strings intro gives way (after a sample of Dubya declaring war on terror) to rocky guitar over militant drums. </p> <p>'Sleepy from a Bad Dream' builds on a low, acidic bassline with a driving snare and cymbals, and has a couple of lovely breakdowns before it disappears in a wash of synth and strings. If only the group had front-loaded their flawed debut; it has hidden strengths.</p>",
  "It's February 2004 and I'm laughing my head off in Nando's restaurant on Coldharbour Lane, Camberwell. I'm slightly tipsy and I have chicken grease and hot piri-piri sauce running down my face. My sister-in-law has just offered to put her money where my mouth is and sponsor me to take a production of Jeffrey Archer's Prison Diary to this year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe. <p>'Ha, ha, nice one!' </p> <p>'I'm serious.' </p> <p>'I know. That's what I'm afraid of.' </p> <p>It all started just before Christmas. Stuck for a present to wow my Labour-voting in-laws, I stumbled upon the perfect idea. I'd buy them Archer's account of the 22 days he spent in a high-security unit. But the last thing a former member of the Workers' Revolutionary Party wants to be discovered doing, is advertising his need for the latest work by Jeffrey Archer. 'It's not for me you understand? It's an ironic Christmas present.' </p> <p>Taking my sister-in-law's offer seriously, I made a start on the script. After two weeks feeling like I'd shared a cell with Archer I emerged hollow eyed and clutching a first draft. To my astonishment, I swiftly acquired permission and had my adaptation approved by Lord Archer himself (although he did politely decline our offer to record the voice of Justice Potts, the judge who presided over the trial and pronounced his sentence). A perfect chance to get his own back, we thought. </p> <p>Up until now I have been quite content to be an anonymous, underachieving actor pottering along the M62. Due to budget constraints I was now writer, director, producer, designer, stage manager and actor (various murderers, madmen, lawyers and prison guards). </p> <p>I have always wanted to perform at the Festival, although the right opportunity had never arisen. The solution: I take my own show up. With Archer's name on the flyers we were bound to stand a chance of getting somebody to come. I did contemplate turning the whole thing into a musical but a) I don't sing well and I want to be in this and b) I'm not Ben Elton. </p> <p>Blow me if we didn't get our first choice venue - the Smirnoff Underbelly - a disused bank vault known for its cutting edge theatre. It is hot, smelly and dank - the perfect setting for a dis graced peer. When my mother-in-law heard that I had been invited to Lord Archer's penthouse apartment with our lead actor, Andrew Macbean, I received a text: 'I hope you are not doing a homage to Archer and turning into a true blue Tory fat-cat.' </p> <p>Lord Archer was very generous answering our probing actors' questions. He even donated the 'Tigger' rugby shirt described in the book, which has now become a treasured item of costume. I can reveal that at home Archer wears splendid maroon slippers embroidered with gold crests. </p> <p>Unfortunately our request to visit Belmarsh was rejected with no explanation. </p> <p>Auditions were an eye-opener. Years of rejection have made me an expert on the subject. What was surprising was the difference in professionalism between the older and younger actors. Among the younger group only two arrived on time. Fortunately the day was saved by Redd Pepper who has the voice of an earthquake. He was originally a train driver on the London Underground when he was discovered by a TV producer while doing Tannoy announcements. He subsequently went on to become the voice of the Hollywood trailer. He will play Justice Potts as well as Archer's solicitor and various inmates. Andrew Macbean, fresh from the RSC and playing a serial womaniser at the Orange Tree, makes the perfect Archer. Karen Clayton (whom I was at drama school with) and myself complete the cast. </p> <p>Like the majority of Fringe productions we are operating on a tight budget. I deal with set, props and costume. I largely have eBay to thank for my clothing. I paid \u00a33 for a pair of 'those slippers'. Thanks to Governor John Podmore, the remaining props are being supplied by our friendly local neighbourhood prison, HMP Brixton. The bed was donated by HMP Reading. </p> <p>Rehearsals began last month. The first weekend off I rewatched my DVD of Scum . The following Monday I entered the rehearsal room with renewed vigour - 'Vegetarians, I fucking shit 'em.' My leadership qualities failed me when the lead actor whipped out his tackle for the 'strip search' scene. I had expected to gently build him up to this. </p> <p>We arrived in Edinburgh last week. On Wednesday we had our technical rehearsal. Because there are so many companies at the Underbelly we were allocated the bracingly early time of 6am. Up at 4.45am to prepare. </p> <p>Last month I was approached by the New York Times asking to print an extract from the play. This must be a good sign. All we need now is an audience. We face the humiliation of badgering complete strangers to persuade them to see us rather than any of the other 1,700 shows on offer. Are we on the brink of oblivion? Five people booked for the first preview. Oh joy. We redouble our leafletting on the Royal Mile. </p> <p><b> \u00b7 </b> Jeffrey Archer's Prison Diary - Hell runs at Smirnoff Underbelly until 29 August. For tickets, call 0870 745 3083</p>",
  "For the residents of Preston Old Road in Blackburn, Lancashire, Tuesday started as just another day. A shopkeeper described the area as 'boring, boring and boring'. However, by just after three in the afternoon it seemed as if this sleepy street had been changed into the set of a big-budget Hollywood action movie. <p>A car chase was followed by two Asian men being forced out of their vehicle at gunpoint and into protective chemical-proof clothing - all in full view of flabbergasted locals. </p> <p>So what was happening? At first some people, including 32-year-old hairdresser Jayne Winward, thought it was a gang war. 'The men were not in uniform and I thought it was gangs at first when I saw the guns,' she says. </p> <p>Winward's fears were allayed slightly when uniformed police arrived later. The two men pulled from the gold-coloured Mercedes were in fact suspects, apprehended by security services on suspicion of terrorist activities. </p> <p>With the country on high alert, the arrests of the two men, along with 11 others in raids across the country last week, seemed to suggest that the authorities were indeed gaining an upper hand on the security threat to the country. </p> <p>But among some British Muslims, particularly young men, these arrests are merely another example of what they perceive as police victimisation and an attack on Islam. </p> <p>Though initially supportive of the fight against terrorism, many British Muslims of all ages are growing disillusioned after seeing more and more of their number arrested in high-profile raids only to be released without charge. </p> <p>Even before learning that one of the men had been released without charge yesterday, friends, neighbours and even people who did not know them were adamant that those arrested would be released without charge. </p> <p>Some even spoke about the threat of a possible reaction from young local Muslims in response to what they describe as a growing schism created by anti-terror legislation and its indiscriminate use by the security authorities. </p> <p>The murmurs of the discontented could be heard after Friday prayers in Blackburn, which, because of the school holidays, were attended by an unusually large number of young boys. </p> <p>Mohammad Shah, a 20-year-old friend of Junaid Feroze, one of the men arrested, says that he is certain his friend will be released. 'I guarantee he will be out,' he says, adding that he believes it is all part of a conspiracy to target Islam. </p> <p>Shah, who has been following the story closely on television and in the newspapers since the news first broke, says of his friend 'he's an ordinary guy', and 'not a terrorist'. </p> <p>Official figures show that between 11 September, 2001, and the end of March this year, 562 arrests have been made under terrorism legislation, and 97 people were charged with terrorist offences. Of those only 14 have been convicted. </p> <p>If more people were convicted, Shah says young Muslims would not feel so disenfranchised by a system that regularly picks up people in an ad hoc manner only to release them without charge, but with their reputation in tatters. </p> <p>'The figures are nonsense. [The authorities] are trying to find a way of being in conflict with Islam. And they are going to cause conflict. Asians are going to think they are being victimised if all terrorism is blamed on Islam. </p> <p>'It will be very difficult for Butch [Feroze's nickname] now he has been shamed. His reputation has gone down the gutter and his business will go down the drain too.' </p> <p>It is not only Blackburn's young Asian population that have been alarmed by these arrests. Respected elders of the community such as Ibrahim Master, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques and a member of the Lancashire Police Authority, has voiced his dismay and fear for the future too. </p> <p>'Mud always sticks,' Master says ruefully. In the Asian community in particular, where reputation and pride are always qualities held in high esteem, the very fact of being arrested is enough to affect an individual's standing. 'However little mud there is, it still sticks. Those people arrested will have to deal with it and this is very unfair,' he says. </p> <p>Master says that these arrests, coupled with the hundreds of others that have taken place across the country in recent times, could indeed lead to a break from mainstream British society for many British Muslims and a potential backlash from the young who feel unfairly targeted. </p> <p>'The arrests create false impressions in the hearts and minds of the wider British public. It makes them feel there's a problem among British Muslims and helps to cast doubt on the loyalty of British Muslims. </p> <p>'What the high volumes of arrests do is further alienate the young people of the community. They are already alienated because of overt and covert discrimination that happens in this country. </p> <p>'There could be a time, God forbid, when they could rebel against this. This type of victimisation is not conducive to bringing young elements of our society back into the fold.' </p> <p>Blackburn, like many other towns and cities around the country that are host to large numbers of British Asians, has distinct areas that are dominated by its immigrant population. </p> <p>Wandering around some of these pockets it becomes clear that the bonds within the various communities, whether they are Indian or Pakistani, are so strong that once they feel under attack or victimised there is a real risk of the community turning in on itself and rejecting outsiders. </p> <p>As far as the war on terror is concerned, this could perhaps be its most crushing blow. Terrorism in the name of Islam is deplored by the vast majority of Muslims in this country and it is they that provide a vital source of intelligence in tackling it. </p> <p>But according to human rights groups we are in real danger of losing this source. </p> <p>Trevor Hemmings, deputy director of Statewatch, says the random 'fishing expeditions' to pick up people will create chaos in the long term. </p> <p>'One of the things that amazes me is that people sit there and talk about how the Muslim society has isolated itself in a de facto segregation. The problem is the Muslim community has never asked to be where they are; they've been forced there.' </p> <p>He says that by forcing people to the margins the police will lose their most vital sources of intelligence.</p>",
  "It was a searingly hot summer day in the Pakistani city of Lahore. At the airport, the usual chaos of relatives, taxi drivers and hotel touts stood and sweated outside the concrete concourse. Broken baggage trolleys lay skewed to one side. Bored traffic policemen wearily searched vehicles. <p>In the throng, no one noticed the clean-cut, slightly chubby young man on his way to the airfreight offices to pick up a package. Nobody, that is, except the men who had been watching Muhammad Khan, a key al-Qaeda target, for six weeks. </p> <p>They had begun surveillance following the arrest a month earlier of a man identified as Musaad Aruchi. Aruchi was picked up by Pakistani paramilitary forces, with CIA help, in Karachi. He had been in touch with Khan regularly. Street maps of New York were found in his apartment, as were some computer disks containing information on other American buildings. </p> <p>It was CIA telephone and internet intercepts that led to Aruchi's arrest. He was held by Pakistani intelligence for three days, before being flown out of the country in an unmarked CIA plane. </p> <p>Then the agents pounced on their next target. Khan was surrounded and swept off the pavement into a waiting vehicle to a high-security prison. The Pakistani security forces, which had resisted American pressure to allow the CIA to run the operation, had reason to be pleased with themselves. The 13 July arrest did far more than take down a one-man communications hub for al-Qaeda. </p> <p>When American intelligence experts arrived in Pakistan and started trawling through the 25-year-old's computers and documents, they were astonished. Khan had been in touch with dozens of other activists all over the world, passing on messages given to him by more senior al-Qaeda figures. </p> <p>It was a massive breakthrough. Laid out in front of them was information that could, if played right, lead them to the heart of al-Qaeda's current operations. Plans were hastily laid. Anti-terror specialists were mobilised. Some of Khan's associates were rapidly traced out. One was Khalfan Gailani, a Tanzanian wanted since 1998 for his part in the bombing of the US embassy in his homeland and one of the FBI's 22 most wanted criminals. Gailani was apprehended two weeks ago in Pakistan, after a 12-hour firefight. </p> <p>As American intelligence officers continued to sift through Khan's records, they realised there was a treasure trove of information. 'It is obviously a very serious victory. It is obvious that there is a real find here,' said Gideon Rose, a former member of the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. </p> <p>Khan, it transpired, had attended an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in the late 1990s and is thought to have associated with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11, 2001 attacks and a militant with extensive experience of aviation. A series of planning documents was stored on disks and a laptop's hard-drive found at Khan's home in a wealthy Lahore suburb. They were surveillance reports, meticulously compiled in a style taught in al-Qaeda training camps, as laid out in the 11-volume 'manual of jihad' compiled by militants in Pakistan. </p> <p>But the most concrete information found on Khan's computer and disks was the existence of five compact files, each one devoted to a separate building in the US. They were the Stock Exchange and Citigroup HQ in New York, insurance giant Prudential Financial in Newark and the IMF and World Bank buildings in Washington. </p> <p>Each document was about 20 printed pages long and mapped out in exact detail a lengthy and comprehensive 'casing' operation that evaluated each building as a target. The files included meticulous logging of pedestrian traffic, the routines of security personnel at the buildings and discussion of which sort of explosives would be best used at each site. The files were written in perfect English. </p> <p>Although it seemed that the research had all been done in 2000 or 2001, at least one of the files on the computer had been opened in January. Nor were documents found on the computer limited to the five buildings. Buildings in other cities, including San Francisco, were mentioned. At least 10 sites in New York alone were found on the computer. In all, there were 500 photographs, drawings and diagrams. Some of them showed underground garages. </p> <p>According to Pakistani officials, there was also evidence of preparations for an attack on Heathrow by British-based activists. There were photographs of terminal buildings and the refuelling centre, as well as of tunnels used by passengers and freight companies. Precise measurements of roads, buildings and underpasses had been recorded. Intelligence sources elsewhere in the region told The Observer last week that the reports had included surveys of underground parking lots so detailed that the gradient of the ramps had been noted. </p> <p>The same sources said the planning also recorded traffic flows on roads around the airport, as well as details of the sequences of traffic lights around the perimeter. </p> <p>Pakistani officials told their American counterparts, and have told The Observer, that the threat was 'present'. They said that Khan had been in touch with six 'jihadi associates' in America. Washington's biggest alarm bells rang. </p> <p>Khan was believed to be a courier of messages between al-Qaeda groups or terrorists. He would receive messages on computer disks and then post them briefly on the internet, using websites hosted in places like Pakistan, Turkey and Nigeria. Though most of the information was old, anti-terrorism experts pointed out that major al-Qaeda attacks were almost always years in the planning. The 11 September attacks were planned for six years and the 1998 attacks on US embassies in east Africa were planned for five years. </p> <p>'I am not alarmed by the age of the intelligence found. I think that just reflects the world view of al-Qaeda operations. They can take years,' said Larry Johnson, a former deputy director of counter-terrorism at the US state department. </p> <p>But, though the material was useful, it was deeply troubling, too. Despite the fact that many of the reports were compiled about 2001, officers around the world knew that a race was on - to find the authors before they could strike. </p> <p>A classic sting was set up. Pakistani intelligence officers prevailed on Khan to work for them. It is not known how he was persuaded to co-operate. The 'deal' was thrashed out at a prison where abuse is commonplace. Last weekend, the young militant finally sent emails to scores of activists in America, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. He requested that they get in touch urgently. As the emails came back, intelligence officers all over the world went into action. </p> <p>President George W. Bush was on board Air Force One when he was told about the news. It was Friday, 30 July, and the Boeing 747 was flying on the campaign trail through the blue skies of Missouri for another stop on his bid for re-election to the White House. </p> <p>The night before, at Langley, Virginia, top CIA officials had been briefed for the first time on the intelligence on Khan's laptops and disks. After 72 straight hours of work by agents and analysts, translating and compiling the information flowing from Pakistan, officials had decided the information was extremely serious. It was put into a morning briefing paper for the president. </p> <p>Bush told national security adviser Condoleezza Rice they had to counter the threat. The operation was already in the works. Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's domestic security adviser, had acted immediately on Friday when she saw the reports on her desk. It was not just the CIA report from Pakistan that was worrying her: another stream of intelligence, possibly gleaned from interrogations of recent detainees, was also hinting strongly that an attack in New York was in the works. </p> <p>By the end of Sunday morning, the homeland security secretary Tom Ridge had briefed the Democratic challenger John Kerry by phone on the threat. He then called senior news executives on various television channels and newspapers in a conference call. Ridge described a 'most unusual set of circumstances where, from a variety of different sources that we continue to exploit, there's a convergence of information that compels us to talk publicly about specific potential targets'. </p> <p>A few minutes later Ridge appeared live on American television to tell the world that New York, Newark and Washington were under threat. </p> <p>British authorities had also been alerted, and moved quickly. It was clear from the start that Khan was likely to have connections to the UK. It is thought that Khan - a fluent English-speaker - had visited the UK a number of times, possibly as recently as November 2002. Khan's father worked for Pakistan's state-run airline, PIA, and had obtained five tickets in his son's name for travel between Pakistan and London over the past four to five years. Khan also had relatives in England, at least some of whom shared his political beliefs. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, British police and security services moved in, arresting 13 (and then releasing one immediately) in north London, Watford, Luton and Blackburn under suspicion of terrorism-related offences. All were men, aged between 19 and 32. No names were released by UK authorities, but American officials revealed that one of those arrested was Eisam al-Hindi, whom they alleged was 'chief of al-Qaeda in Britain'. Details about al-Hindi have been thin. One man arrested last week in a separate raid was Babar Ahmad. American officials want to extradite him for terrorist offences relating to Afghanistan and Chechnya. Ahmad is currently in detention. </p> <p>Direct links to senior al-Qaeda figures among British Muslim activists are rare. However, many have had links to other militants in Pakistan who themselves may have connections to al-Qaeda figures. 'That's the nature of modern Islamic militancy,' he said. 'It's all about who you know. It's about personal connections and being able to source the right materials at the right time to carry out your own schemes.' </p> <p>The vast bulk of these men are British citizens of Pakistani descent, although some are from the Middle East who have been naturalised after emigrating to the UK. Many were active in Kashmir during the 1990s, travelling from the UK to Pakistan to join militant outfits launching guerrilla attacks on Indian forces in the parts of Kashmir that are under New Delhi's rule. Such activities were not illegal at the time - though they now are. </p> <p>Many of Britain's Pakistani community are from the Mirpur region, close to Kashmir, and sympathise with the cause, if not the means, of the militants. Hundreds of young Pakistani-descended British citizens have spent a few weeks or months with 'mujahideen' groups, many sponsored by the Pakistani government, in Kashmir or training in Afghanistan or Pakistan in the past decade. </p> <p>'A lot just did a few weeks one summer and then came home, got married and settled down. They are devout Muslims whose faith is an important part of their identity, but not active any more in any kind of radicalism,' said one Islamic activist. </p> <p>However, there are concerns that more recent recruits to militancy may be missed. Sources within the Islamic activist community speak of 'several dozen' young men from Britain who have made their way to Afghanistan since 2001 to fight the Americans. Such men are far more likely to have contact with al-Qaeda and, terrorism experts say, pose a far more imminent threat than 'old warriors'. </p> <p>Police are also concerned that low-level training of militants may be continuing. There are reports of radical Muslim groups organising 'martial training' in east London. 'There's nothing wrong with people practising karate, but we don't know exactly what they are doing. The idea of small groups of young radicalised Muslims getting together after prayers in a mosque to plan any kind of activity that is based in ideas of any kind of violence is concerning,' one security specialist said. 'No one has the resources to monitor these things and it may well be wrong to do so. It could be totally innocent ... but it is also well-known that these kinds of small group activities are a classic conduit to terrorist recruitment.' </p> <p>Despite the arrests, Pakistan is continuing to provide a 'production line' of new terrorists. Along the Afghan-Pakistani frontier, with their high mountains, rugged valleys and fiercely independent, devoutly Muslim and heavily armed inhabitants provide perfect cover for fugitives. Among these dusty, dry hills, a senior Pakistani military officer told The Observer recently, that up to 600 'foreign' militants are hiding. They included Khan and Ghailani and, almost certainly, Osama bin Laden and his closest aides. </p> <p>Most analysts last week agreed that bin Laden was still alive - and probably in relatively good health, despite being on the run for nearly three years. Although al-Qaeda's leader has issued frequent statements on cassettes, he has not appeared in any new video images for some time. </p> <p>The reason, experts say, is that the Saudi master of propaganda is waiting for the right moment, such as after a strike on the scale of 11 September, to appear on the worlds' television screens. Such a return would have a devastating impact on the morale of his pursuers and lift the spirits of his followers immeasurably. </p> <p>The Americans, the Pakistanis and their allies want to stop that happening. But a major push in March, involving regular US troops, the Pakistani army and Afghan militia forces - as well as specialist American units transferred from Iraq - failed to turn up any substantive leads. </p> <p>To launch an attack 'real-time' data is needed, telling the planners where bin Laden is, not where he was. And even should this be obtained, Bush will have to decide whether to use a cruise missile to obliterate the terrorist leader - and risk destroying evidence of his death - or try an immensely risky operation to kill or even capture him. Recent efforts by the Pakistani army to push into the tribal areas - acting as beaters for the American guns - have failed in the face of concerted local resistance. </p> <p>The Pashtun tribes were particularly angered by the assassination of a popular resistance leader, Nek Mohammed, by an American missile that struck while the tribal chief was using a satellite phone to talk to the BBC. </p> <p>'There are grave obstacles, of course in operating in these areas,' a senior Pakistani general said recently. 'But the real problems are caused by the global situation. We are not fighting a campaign in a vacuum.' </p> <p>Analysts no longer talk about al-Qaeda as an organisation. 'It's as much an ideology as a definable group,\" said one security expert. 'It's impossible to estimate how many people are involved. You are a member of al-Qaeda if you say you are and that makes it very hard to tracking individuals and interdict plots,' said one former CIA counter-terrorism agent. 'There are a lot of very angry people out there.' </p> <p>Another trend picked out by analysts is the increasing co-operation between differ ent militant groups. Until recently, Pakistani militants fighting in Kashmir rarely co-operated with Arab militants dedicated to a 'global jihad'. Increasingly, the groups have become indistinguishable. The same phenomenon has been noticed elsewhere. 'It's all fusing into one worldwide \"Jihadi international\",' the former agent said. 'It's moved well beyond bin Laden or a few guys in a cave somewhere. It's now far more fragmented and diverse.' </p> <p>A British intelligence expert who has advised the government said that there were no 'metrics' for judging progress in the war on terror. </p> <p>'Police and intelligence services worldwide are doing their job - taking down cells, locating operatives, breaking up plots - well, and that is having a significant short term impact,' he said. </p> <p>'But long-term success in defeating terorrism doesn't necessarily follow. Four thousand people have been killed or imprisoned since 2001 and, although the loss of experienced, skilled men has an impact, the vacancies are being filled. </p> <p>'In Saudi Arabia they keep arresting \"leaders\" and new one's come forward. There's no shortage of recruits anywhere and that means there will be no shortage of threats in the coming years.' </p> <p>Perhaps the web of contacts uncovered by arresting Khan will reveal further links to al-Qaeda sleepers in America and Britain. But it also might not. 'This is not the key that will unlock all of al-Qaeda,' Rose added. </p> <p>On Thursday, police in Albany, in upstate New York, arrested two local Islamic clerics. They had been caught after a year-long sting operation in which the pair had believed they were laundering money in connection with the purchase of shoulder-fired missiles. The swoop had nothing to do with Khan's network, but showed conclusively that other terrorist dangers still exist. </p> <p>They may have started rounding up Khan's alleged contacts, but the war goes on. The intelligence agencies continue to probe for leads; the enemy continues to regroup and plan for a new 'spectacular'. And the police hunt them. And so it goes on. </p> <p><b>Combating the international jihad</b></p> <p><b>Vigilance is the watchword</b> </p> <p>Since September 11 2001 there have been 622 people arrested under the powers in the terrorism 2000 act. So far 97 of them have been charged with terrorism-related offences and only 15 have actually been convicted. Of the total 152 were charged under other legislation (commonly relating to identify fraud of credit card offences) or released into the custody of the immigration service. 284 have been released without charge. </p> <p>Spending on protecting the UK from terrorism is expected to reach \u00a32.1 billion by 2007-8, more than double the amount before the September 11 attacks. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ are to receive funding for 1,000 extra intelligence staff and local authorities will have additional resources for civil defence preparations. Worldwide, 625 people were killed in terrorist attacks during 2003. The number of individual attacks rose from 205 to 208. The number of deaths was down from 2002 when 725 were killed but the numbers wounded rose significantly from 2,013 in 2002 to 3,646 in 2003. The increase has been attributed to an increase in the number of attacks on 'soft targets' including places of worship, hotels and commercial districts which are intended to produce large numbers of casualties. </p> <p>Despite the threat of a possible terrorist attack on London, tourists are visiting the capital in record numbers. The latest statistics reveal that 6.5 million visitors came to the UK between March and May, a rise of 21 per cent and the highest number ever recorded during this period. Around half stayed in the capital. Passenger numbers arriving at British airports increased by 7 per cent in June alone. There has also been a 17 per cent rise in the number of Americans visiting the UK, something credited to the huge popularity of Tony Blair across America. Last month twenty five million copies of a government booklet, 'Preparing for Emergencies', which gives advice on what to do in the event of a major terrorist attack and other emergencies, were sent out to households across the country. The Government has denied the publication of the booklet is any indication of an imminent attack.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Carnesky's Ghost Train</strong> Old Truman Brewery, London E1, to 23 Sept</p> <p><strong>Night Season</strong> Cottesloe, London SE1, to 17 Nov</p> <p><strong>Singin' in the Rain</strong> Sadler's Wells, London EC1, to 4 Sept</p> <p>Burlesque and aerialists, fairground sideshows and Victorian illusionism - old skills and disregarded arts are having an unprecedented revival. In <strong> Carnesky's Ghost Train</strong>, they come together to make a show with a totally distinctive flavour: simple but knowing, dark and childish; haunting rather than spooky. </p> <p>Marisa Carnesky came up with the idea. She was one of the powers behind Duckie's droll and dirty nightclub show which last Christmas gave the Barbican its first camp moment; she (who is covered in tattoos) also created Jewish Tattooess - about the tattoo taboo in Judaism. </p> <p>Now Carnesky has joined forces with the man who taught Harry Potter to do spells. Paul Kieve was 'physical magic consultant' on The Prisoner of Azkaban, in which he appeared as a wizard, and took on Daniel Ratcliffe as a private pupil. He's worked with the mind-reading Derren Brown, advised David Copperfield, and spirited fairy coaches out of the air for Improbable Theatre's Cinderella . </p> <p>Together with dancers and aerialists and mime artists and engineers, Carnesky and Kieve have created a ride on a ghost train which retains features of the old-style version - a small, clanking locomotive, a fairground facade in Edwardian browns and purples, the colours of a Sickert painting. But instead of the traditional kit of manufactured objects - the dangling plastic skeleton and the wet thing that dabs you on the forehead in a dark corner - Carnesky offers human hauntings. </p> <p>A small tent - this is the first illusion - seems, once you're inside it, to contain acres of track, an entire mazy world. In the dark, the train jolts past a series of illuminated pictures: they could be windows or grottos; all contain a female in limbo. In tinsel and tulle, with Pre-Raphaelite hair, some look like conjurors' assistants, relics of tricks that have gone wrong. One sits solemnly trying to re-attach a huge purple limb which has somehow got away from the rest of her body. Another, slavering and in rags, stretches her arm towards the train passengers through the bars of a bedlam window. A third very slowly somersaults through the air, suspended, without touching ground or walls, as if she were tumbling through water, in perpetual rotation. There's one in a bird mask and another who chases herself around a frightening prison of a booth. </p> <p>Carnesky intends this as an investigation of female migration and European displacement. Well, you'd have to have a crystal ball to know exactly this from looking. But you'd have to be insentient not to experience a more general feeling of loss, seeing these figures in Brick Lane, where Jack the Ripper dismembered so many women. </p> <p>At the end of the ride comes the most mysterious and enchanting moment. All the women - from the one in a tutu who marshals you into your carriage, to the one with auburn hair reaching to her toes - come together in a sylvan scene, moonily, as if they have all lost something but can't quite remember what. They line up, as if to advance on the train that's halted beside them. And as the passengers stare, all the women vanish. The light is the same, the scenery hasn't changed, the audience hasn't blinked - but what they've watched has disappeared. Not aged, not faded, just gone. </p> <p><strong> The Night Season</strong> works another variation on a classic female situation. Three sisters, an absent mother, an unsatisfactory dad: this is the family life of Chekhov's sad siblings, of King Lear , of Cinderella and the Bront\u00ebs. But Rebecca Lenkiewicz puts her sisters in Sligo, and allows them a dash of Yeats and lots of drinking as well as some star-gazing and dancing on the beach. </p> <p>The plot is under-developed and too heavily trimmed with eccentricities. But it's wittily written and so passionately played that this is more affecting than many more substantial plays. It's never a waste of time watching Annette Crosbie who, as the fading grandmother, goes batty with just the right mixture of frailty and acerbity. Susan Lynch is both splendid and sour as the eldest uptight sister, Sarah-Jane Drummey perfectly crumpled and cross as the littlest. David Bradley brings his unique brand of gallows humour and old-combatant bearing to the father. </p> <p>And Lucy Bailey's direction emphasises Lenkiewicz's most interesting feat: the way she switches between domestic realism and dreaming wildness and back again: the play opens with a wonderful moment in which a nightmare-racked Bradley disappears into a dent in his bed as if he were being sucked down a plughole. </p> <p>Dick Bird's design draws on this strangeness: he has devised a bare landscape of undulating wood which serves as a perch for bedrooms and kitchens. In the background, long, grey panels show rain falling continuously; eventually, pools of real water spread across the stage, lapping away around Gran's armchair. </p> <p>The downpour at the Cottesloe is actually more impressive than the storm in Paul Kerryson's production of <strong> Singin' in the Rain</strong>, where raindrops fall from the sky in a tidy row. Adam Cooper, who is becoming a specialist in aquatic characters (he was the Swan in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake ), has to perform his sliding, loose-limbed, beguiling movements in one dimension, like a gymnast on a bar. </p> <p>Elsewhere, neither the dancing (choreographed by Cooper) nor the dialogue has the ease - the sense that it's somehow tumbled out of life - that made the original film so memorable. The jokes creak out self-consciously; 'Make 'em Laugh' doesn't. It's hard to sink a musical which has so many good numbers, but this evening tries pretty hard to do so, with its long-drawn-out blandness. The most effective sequence is on film, where Ronni Ancona is enjoyably squawky as the silent movie star who sounds like a parakeet. But seeing a movie can't be the point of going to the theatre. </p>",
  "<p>British Airways will this week increase surcharges on tickets by about 200 per cent in response to the continued rise in crude oil and jet fuel prices. </p> <p>Chief executive Rod Eddington will say at tomorrow's first-quarter results presentation that the current \u00a32.50 charge on one-way tickets will be increased to between \u00a36 and \u00a38 on long- haul routes. The charge on return tickets will go from \u00a35 to between \u00a312 and \u00a316. The charges become effective from the middle of the week and will not be backdated. </p> <p>The move comes after a week in which crude prices reached record highs day after day, driven by fears over disruptions to supply at Russian oil giant Yukos, unrest in other oil-producing countries such as Nigeria and Venezuela, and the terrorist threat hanging in the background. On Friday, US light crude reached a record $44.77 in New York, while Brent touched $41.50 - another historic high. </p> <p>BA's move follows applications last Friday from Cathay Pacific to the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department to increase its existing $5 one-way and $14 return surcharges. BA introduced the current charges in May following increases in crude prices driven by fears over terrorist threats to oil supplies. Others, including Air France/KLM, Virgin, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, also introduced charges. </p> <p>Fuel bills are the second highest cost to airlines and can account for up to 16 per cent of their total costs. Analysts estimate the increased fuel costs generated by the higher oil price are adding some \u00a3200 million annually to BA's spending. </p> <p>BA is expected to announce pre-tax profits of around \u00a3100m for the three months to the end of June - traditionally the second-busiest quarter of the year. Last year, it made a \u00a345m loss over the same period. </p> <p>But analysts estimate that profits would have been between \u00a325m and \u00a350m higher for the first quarter had it not been for the 10 to 15 per cent increase in fuel costs in the period. </p> <p>BA will also update investors on its fuel-hedging position. According to the most recently published data, it has hedged the least of all European airlines - buying forward 45 per cent of its requirement until March next year. Lufthansa has bought forward 90 per cent until December, Air France 72 per cent to March, and Iberia 80 per cent to December this year and 30 per cent to December next year. </p> <p>It is thought that BA will have increased its figure, although the price at which it has done so is likely to be higher than the $28.50 a barrel it paid previously. </p> <p>BA is facing pressure on other fronts. Traffic figures out last week showed a rebound in passenger volumes, but Eddington is likely to repeat the warnings issued by low-cost carriers last week that competition is keeping prices, and therefore yields, low. Analysts expect him to confirm a 2 to 3 per cent increase in revenues this year. </p> <p>Meanwhile, two out of three unions representing 8,000 terminal and baggage-handling staff are balloting members for industrial action over pay. The ballots could see a repeat of the strikes at Heathrow airport last summer that caused havoc for holidaymakers and cut 40 per cent from BA's earnings.</p>",

Asda will buy at least four large former Safeway shops in the West Midlands and North West with a fifth still under negotiation. </p> <p>The Competition Commission said it would allow Asda to buy just six former Safeways from Morrison's when it blocked the Wal-Mart chain from bidding for the full business. Wal-Mart-owned Asda is understood to have agreement to buy stores in Burton-on-Trent, Coventry, Shrewsbury and St Helen's. </p> <p>Chief operating officer Tony De Nunzio is expanding in this region, with plans for a standalone non-food pilot store in Walsall due to open in October. </p> <p>But the deal still leaves Ken Morrison with 19 stores he has to sell by the autumn if he is to comply with the commission's rules. </p> <p>Tesco has not ruled itself out and, under the terms of the Safeway acquisition, could buy up to 13. </p> <p>Morrison's has sold 14 of the original 52 to Sainsbury's and a further 14 to Waitrose which also bought five stores that were not on the commission's list. The Co-op bought another. Meanwhile, Morrison's plans to sell 120 smaller stores of 15,000 sq ft or less have attracted interest across the food sector. </p> <p>This part of the Safeway portfolio contributed to Morrison's first-ever profit warning last month and they want rid of it. Safeway's former chief executive, Carlos Criado-Perez, has formed a consortium, along with his former trading director, Jack Sinclair, to bid for the whole package. </p> <p>Morrison wanted to recruit Sinclair to the new board when he took control of Safeway, but failed to persuade him that he would have a big enough role. </p> <p>M&amp;S and Sainsbury's are understood to have registered interest in some of the stores before the deadline a week ago. Asda's De Nunzio ruled out bidding for any of the stores because they are all too small. </p> <p>Morrison's and Asda last night refused to comment.</p>",
  "The Home Secretary has warned that American-style openness over the al-Qaeda threat risked exposing politicians to 'ridicule', and dismissed calls for him to supply more details to the British public as 'arrant nonsense'. <p>In a startling sideswipe at the White House - which put troops around what it said were new targets in New York last week, only for it to emerge that the intelligence underpinning the supposed threat was years old - David Blunkett says he is not prepared to discuss security operations simply to 'feed the news frenzy' in a slow summer. The Home Secretary, writing in The Observer today, is understood to be furious with David Davis, his Tory shadow, whom he had offered a confidential briefing about the arrests of 13 terror suspects in Britain last week.</p> <p>Davis declined, but then went on to criticise the Home Office publicly for not being open enough, a move interpreted within the Blunkett camp as rank hypocrisy.</p> <p>However, there has also been dismay in Whitehall at the willingness of American sources to comment openly on the British cases, amid concerns that the extradition to the US of one of those arrested could be jeopardised.</p> <p>Blunkett makes clear that he will not 'do or say anything that would prejudice any trial', adding that to comment on claims of a terror plot would only have fuelled wild speculation: 'Is that really the job of a senior cabinet minister in charge of counter-terrorism? To feed the media? To increase concern? To have something to say, whatever it is, in order to satisfy the insatiable desire to hear somebody saying something?'</p> <p>His intervention will however be seen as the clearest signal yet that last week's reports of a new plot to bomb Heathrow - following the arrest of an al-Qaeda expert in Pakistan, and the subsequent arrests in Britain - were wrong. The reports followed the discovery of computer files and documents in Pakistan from an alleged al-Qaeda suspect. It later emerged that the documents had been compiled before 2001, although they had been examined as recently as January.</p> <p>While terrorists are known to have reconnoitred 'picture postcard' targets - from Heathrow to the Houses of Parliament - senior Whitehall sources said there was no specific new threat last week.</p> <p>Blunkett's words reflect a growing row over political handling of intelligence, with accusations in Washington that George Bush may be overemphasising the threat in order to boost his chances in November's presidential election - and in London, a new willingness by the Tories to make political capital out of the terror issue.</p> <p>Last night, Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, rose to Blunkett's defence, warning of a 'Faustian bargain' between the media and politicians over terrorism. 'I am acutely aware that there is a Faustian bargain on offer for those who want it: airtime, in exchange for ratcheting the fear factor one notch higher,' he told The Observer . </p> <p>He said the Bush administration's naming of potential targets in New York was 'of dubious worth', and that information should be published 'only if it would prove useful in preventing injury and loss of life'.</p> <p>However Oaten said that while he backed a more low-key approach to the threat, it would have been less severe in the first place had the government not invaded Iraq.</p> <p>His words reflect fears in Whitehall that high-profile American terror warnings have backfired. In his article, Blunkett argues that speculating in the same way about British targets would only cause panic: 'There has been column inch after column inch devoted to the fact that in the United States there is often high-profile commentary, followed - as in the most current case - by detailed scrutiny with the potential risk of inviting ridicule.</p> <p>'In Britain the accusation is the opposite. It is that we don't say enough... we don't sufficiently raise the profile, and therefore the concern about terrorism.'</p> <p>Last week's arrests came at a sensitive time, coinciding with a highly critical report from a joint parliamentary committee on human rights which attacked the detention without trial of al-Qaeda suspects. Blunkett is currently consulting on new anti-terrorism laws to replace the emergency powers.</p> <p>A specialist Islamic unit set up by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been receiving reports of young Muslims in the north of England becoming increasingly hostile to the authorities, with some starting to glamourise suicide bombers. </p> <p>Home Office research into the Bangladeshi community has also revealed young people are largely cut off from mainstream British culture. A spokesperson said surveys had shown many young Bangladeshis did not see British newspapers or TV news, preferring homegrown newspapers and satellite TV.</p> <p>The Commission for Racial Equality is now calling for the police to record the race and faith of people stopped and searched under new anti-terrorism legislation, to check whether Muslims are specifically targeted.</p>",
  "<p>Tourists not wishing to fight off seaside hoverflies or linger by a sewage-swamped Thames will today be converging on Britain's stately homes. Of the 17 million people who will visit privately-owned historic estates this year, more than two-thirds will skip the house, in favour of stableyard caf\u00e9s, lion enclaves or organic cactus shops that keep the nation's heritage factories solvent. </p> <p>The palaces of Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor have mutated into Alton Towers. Yet these Disneyfied theme parks, far from being as incongruous as a Little Chef in a Cuyp landscape, have also become a symbol of almost sacred splendour. In a nostalgic and a nervous country, places combining an aura of serene and lavish pasts with modern retail therapy salve many needs. </p> <p>So how how bold of John Prescott to declare a ban on new neo-classical mansions. The 'Gummer' clause, which allows planning permission for grandiose country homes, will be retained, but only for 'cutting-edge' properties. Mr Prescott, vilified by his critics for Stalinist tactics, was not helped by newspapers' disclosure that his personal taste does not run to geodesic gherkins. Chez Prescott is the sort of turreted pile to which Henry VIII might have banished Anne of Cleves, if only Barratt had been around to devise executive villas for remaindered Tudor queens. </p> <p>But Mr Prescott, far from being an arch-brutalist, has eclectic tastes. A recent speech reveals a fondness for Bath, Port Sunlight, Birmingham Selfridges, Poundbury, the London Eye and almost every other existing structure. Mr Prescott might also have mentioned the windowbox geraniums at 25b Acacia Mansions, or the striking exterior of Filthy McNasty's whisky bar. </p> <p>Though Mr Prescott is parodied as a ready-mix concrete truck in human guise, the Labour government to which he belongs has, more than any other, blessed the landed gentry. Soon after the Second World War, 500 country houses were demolished, and successive socialist administrations pruned the wealth and style of the aristocracy. </p> <p>Now the country house set has artfully bounced back. In a switch of roles, titled entrepreneurs affect deference to the less wealthy, pledging 24-hour despatch of on-line quince jelly, bottled by baronial hand and brewed on antique Agas. Cleverly, they have snatched populist credentials. </p> <p>Toff lit, once the province of Channon and Waugh, has evolved into Bella Pollen's Hunting Unicorns, a story of Debrett's folk selling 6,000 copies a week after being nominated for the sun-lounger variant of the Prix Goncourt, Richard and Judy's 'Summer Read'. In a menacing world, Britain has reached a high tide of revivalism. Last week alone, English Heritage advertised for a state jester in the Times, the Heritage Lottery Fund launched a \u00a34 million 'emergency' fund to train dry stone-wallers, and the Daleks returned to Dr Who. </p> <p>This, in his opponents' view, is no moment for the deputy prime minister to despoil the countryside with modernist atrocities, such as Grafton New Hall in Cheshire, which resembles a splayed quartet of prawns conjoined at the head. According to the neo-classical architect, Quinlan Terry, Prescott's edict is an elitist, Blairite, Big Brotherish approach to architecture. </p> <p>When Mr Terry speaks of Big Brother, you can bet he is not thinking of the architectural gem just vacated by trans-sexual Nadia and her housemates. Mr Terry does not watch television and one imagines that his notion of hell would be to become stuck next to Lord Rogers in a Homebase checkout queue. </p> <p>Rogers is certainly a modernist and an establishment darling, but so was Vanbrugh, even if any architect might rather have Castle Howard than the Dome in his portfolio. Still, today's traditionalists also wield considerable influence, not least on a Prince of Wales who would prefer the British populace to be housed in something resembling the set for Mrs Tiggywinkle: The Musical. </p> <p>The prince and his coterie do not always hold much sway, however, over the Royal Institute of British Architects, a body less eager to see a countryside designed along the lines of Postman Pat's Greendale, with a bit of high Tory prohibitionism thrown in. (No wind farms and no gypsies.) Riba, as the anti-Prescott axis rightly notes, has a warm relationship with government, supporting its new urbanism policy and gaining, in return, sanction for the grand projects that bolster egos and bank balances. </p> <p>Charges of cronyism do not make a case for retro-Palladian palaces. Nor does the fact that many old masterpieces are pastiches. Conversely, Longleat was the Pompidou Centre of its day. But the issue is less of taste than of fair shares. </p> <p>The English countryside, full of whingeing farmers and resentful fox-hunters, may be over-rated, but it remains the habitat of choice. Roughly half the population wants to live there. Internet companies offer 'strategic land' for sale to those hoping their cheap plots will get planning permission as the 120,000 new homes needed each year, according to the Barker report, eat up the green belt. The government, and architects, have other ideas. </p> <p>Build it dense, make it brownfield and disabuse those who want Georgian glory in stone-clad breezeblocks. Why, at a time when ordinary people are being weaned off neo-classicism, should the rich be indulged? In centuries to come, visitors to the elite estates approved up to now under Gummer's law are likely to find only the remains of an electrified security system, a personal gym, Egyptian cotton bedlinen from Peter Jones and enough marbled bidets to recreate the Parthenon. Such houses are not community or political hubs, or providers of employment. They succeed only in giving feudalism a good name. </p> <p>If we need more of them, and it is not clear why, then they must be truly innovative rarities that will enhance the countryside now and through the centuries. The government is right. Even so, its argument that bold country house design will trickle down to futuristic Prescottvilles is unconvincing. As the Campaign to Protect Rural England suggests, it was not necessary to build the Petit Trianon to devise a worker's cottage. </p> <p>It is true, though, that modernists have little chance to shine in a country whose recent ventures include the Princess Diana memorial nappy bucket and a Daniel Libeskind building achieving the difficult feat of lowering the tone of the Holloway Road. We need more genuinely stunning modern public architecture and fewer hybrids of a Smeg dishwasher brochure and Gosford Park . </p> <p>Tycoons who fancy themselves as Mr Darcy should watch Griff Rhys Jones's Restoration programme on BBC2. From it, they will get a flavour of the mass of irreplaceable British buildings crumbling to dust, for the want of someone to support or buy them. If thwarted traditionalists really want to sink their cash and talents into securing Britain's heritage, they need look no further. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@btinternet.com\">mary.riddell@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There is no area of public health that is more contentious than childhood vaccination. Six years ago the public were left confused and worried over the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination. The outwash is still being felt in depressed immunisation rates. </p> <p>Following MMR, we would have hoped that ministers had learnt that reassuring people over immunisation should be a carefully thought-through process. Uncertain messages are the last thing parents need. </p> <p>But that is exactly what they are getting. Last week the government sent a circular to GPs saying that babies will no longer be given vaccines containing mercury after fears were raised of a link with autism. A new vaccine will be available in the autumn. </p> <p>As a precautionary measure this is to be welcomed. But a serious question is now left hanging in the air - why was it left to a press leak to start bringing such an important change to the public's attention? </p> <p>The fallout will be damaging - doctors will be swamped by parents with newborn babies asking why they must give them the current vaccine containing mercury, and why they can't wait for the new dose. The GPs will not be able to answer all the questions because they will not receive full details until tomorrow. The website explaining the change is not up and running. </p> <p>The government should change the way it handles major health announcements. No more than 24 hours after sending new information to doctors, a public statement should be made about why the change is happening. Announcements on vaccination changes should be made only when the vaccine is available. </p> <p>Only then can the government hope to control such a sensitive agenda. They are in danger of failing this time. The last thing Britain needs right now is a re-run of the measles panic.</p>",
  "Chief constables are demanding a network of new official gypsy camps across the British countryside to quell the growing tensions between travellers and villagers over illegal settlements. <p>The shortage of legal pitches is forcing gypsies to seize or build on land illegally, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) warned, triggering 'real difficulties' for the police in tackling clashes between travellers and villagers. </p> <p>The backing from senior police officers for a long-held complaint within the gypsy community comes after a summer of tense stand-offs across rural England over illegal camps. </p> <p>'The problem for travelling communities is that sites just don't exist for them to be able to move to, either with any sense of permanence or transit sites,' said Margaret Wood, assistant chief constable of West Mercia and Acpo spokeswoman on gypsy issues. 'The presence of a large group can be very difficult within sometimes very small communities. There are real difficulties there in the operational sense that is potentially a problem.' </p> <p>Wood said gypsies still suffered 'appalling' discrimination and claims of traveller crime sprees were often unfounded: 'You hear things such as \"When that group arrived, crimes soared\" and sometimes find that actually in the area of some of these unauthorised encampments crime reduced dramatically. They have been used as scapegoats.' </p> <p>However, she warned that, with too many people in small country communities fighting for insufficient services, tensions were understandable for 'a very small community that's now found itself greatly enlarged'. </p> <p>Although the police have new powers to move gypsies on under anti-social behaviour legislation, Wood said these could be used only if there was somewhere for the encampment to go - which is often not the case. </p> <p>The summer's clashes have given birth to a Middle England protest movement - with threats to picket Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott's house and even warnings of vigilante action - that has clear parallels to previous outbreaks of hostility towards asylum seekers dispersed across the country. </p> <p>Alastair McWhirter, Chief Constable of Suffolk, told a Commons inquiry into traveller issues that he had 'never seen such racism' as was shown to gypsies. </p> <p>Ministers are reluctant to force councils to provide more sites, fearing a backlash from neighbouring communities. However, Acpo and the Commission for Racial Equality are demanding changes in this autumn's housing bill to create a legal duty forcing councils to provide sites. </p> <p>Sarah Spencer, CRE's deputy chairman, said it was prepared to take legal action against councils considered to be discriminating against gypsies over housing needs. More sites, she said, would help to break a 'vicious cycle': 'The lack of sites mean people camp where they shouldn't, which means residents are unhappy, which means there is press coverage, which means there is pressure to have no legal sites. It goes round and round and round. Vilifying gypsies and travellers is not going to help us find a solution.' </p> <p>Discrimination against gypsies, as with any ethnic minority, is illegal, but Spencer said it remained 'the last socially acceptable form of racism'. Rural pubs and shops still regularly display 'No Travellers' signs. </p> <p>Both the CRE and police also argue that legal sites are essential to provide regular access to healthcare and schooling for gypsy children. Police also want more intelligence sharing between forces to track a minority of antisocial elements and for more co-ordinated efforts to tackle tax and VAT evasion. </p> <p>The government is carrying out a review of gypsy issues, due by the end of summer. In a statement, Planning Minister Keith Hill said the government 'acknowledges there are concerns surrounding the provision of appropriate and authorised sites'.</p>",
  "It should have been Clifford Codona's perfect summer evening. Barbecued salmon drizzled with balsamic vinegar followed by Emmerdale on his 44-inch Toshiba widescreen. <p>But last Friday the 45-year-old kept glancing anxiously out of his caravan into the field where his family had lived for seven years. The bailiffs were due any moment to force his wife and children from the plot they bought in 1997. But his fears ran far deeper than the perennial threat of eviction. People wanted to kill him for being a gypsy. A similar sense of dread was sweeping through Britain's 300,000-strong nomadic fraternity.</p> <p>Britain's gypsies, accustomed to a stereotype of thieving layabouts, say they are under siege like never before. High Court judge John Weeks could not have imagined the repercussions of his decision to defend a small group of them. Within hours of him agreeing to let a band of travellers remain at an illegal site near the Wiltshire village of Minety, mistrust had given way to allegations of ethnic cleansing. Initial optimism among race campaigners that the debate over travellers' rights would move into more enlightened territory soon crumbled. By opting for a verdict Weeks felt was humane, the judge had inadvertently handed the tabloids the ammunition they had craved.</p> <p>One newspaper offered readers a map detailing the location of travellers' encampments, a move that left many shaking their heads in despair. Rural Britain was no longer safe warned the Tories. Two days after Weeks had delivered his verdict, Codona was talking about manning the barricades: 'I'm living in constant fear purely because people know I'm a gypsy. You worry you'll be found in a ditch.' Deep in Conservative Bedfordshire, the only way to survive was to 'become a hermit'. </p> <p>To middle England they are the great unwashed, hell-bent on terrorising law-abiding denizens. According to urban myth, Pikeys pillage villages, hurling excrement on gardens and intimidating those who dare cross their path. Codona has never considered either. Anyone spending time in the pastoral spot he calls home - and anyone is welcome - would stumble across a way of life not dissimilar to that of a conventional family. When salmon is off the menu, the Codonas like nothing more than a ferocious vindaloo and lager. Their sons spend time surfing the web in the caravan or playing in nearby woods. Their youngest Jack Russell, Rory, follows their three-year-old grandson John everywhere. Codona has made herculean attempts to ingratiate himself in the local community and, unusual for a gypsy, boasts friends in the police and local council: 'I love getting on with everyone, that is our nature.' </p> <p>Despite his comments, the Commission for Racial Equality warned that travellers had become 'by some distance' the most derided group in multicultural UK. Relations between a fraternity roughly the size of Britain's Bangladeshi population and many in the settled community are at breaking point. </p> <p>'Putting gypsy on a CV means you will never get an interview never mind the job. Plus it leaves you vulnerable, open to attack, discrimination', said Codona. That may explain why the precise numbers of Romany gypsies who arrived in England 400 years ago remain unknown. Many are too afraid to admit Romany blood for fear of retribution, David Essex being one of the few famous exceptions. Yet race campaigners say it doesn't explain why the national census ignores them or why government has refused to collate attacks on travellers, unlike other ethnic minorities. </p> <p>Much was made last week of the travellers' craving for illegal encampments. The truth is less impressive, only 3,979 unauthorised traveller caravans exist in Britain with less than a third of councils offering some accommodation for gypsies. Of those that do, sites tend to occupy bleak locations close to motorway junctions, rubbish tips and urban wasteland. The rural idyll remains a vain illusion. It is ten years since the Tories effectively destroyed the centuries-old travellers' way of life by informing local councils they no longer had to provide sites for them. Since then, relations between the settled community and their nomadic counterparts have slowly deteriorated. Attacks against travellers are thought to run into their hundreds, possibly thousands a year. </p> <p>The CRE believes racism towards gypsies has become wholly acceptable, signs informing 'no travellers allowed' still swing above pub doors across Britain. Bombarded with negative images, maybe it is no surprise that in a recent poll a third of respondents admitted they were prejudiced against travellers. The memory of last year's bonfire celebrations in Firle, Sussex, where an effigy of a gypsy caravan was set on fire, still burns brightly in the minds of the traveller community. The BNP has been quick to scent the depth of disquiet being extended towards gypsies. After securing three seats on Epping Forest District Council, one of the group's first statements vowed to 'evict travellers/ gypsies from private or council lands'. </p> <p>Those who study the problem believe the rift is antagonised by the fact that very few gypsies are ever heard in the media. The tired clich\u00e9 of the thieving, stinking scavenger continues to prevail. </p> <p>The Codonas have tried everything to stay on their small rural camp, but still the local council deems their site illegal and refuses to grant the family's caravan planning permission. It is a recurring theme. Although 80 per cent of planning applications from non-gypsies are accepted, nine in ten applications by travellers are initially rejected.</p> <p>That the Codonas stand to lose everything will bring little sympathy from some. In fact news they have finally been forced from the field they bought in exchange for heirlooms, horses and most of their worldly possessions will bring a cheer in nearby pubs. Although Codona has lived by the old Romany virtues of discipline and integration, he does concede some travellers have not helped. Reports of verbal abuse, intimidation and antisocial behaviour continue to crop up around some camps. The Firle effigy was blamed on a field of travellers who had terrorised village locals. Earlier this summer armed police were called in after reports of gunfire during a four-hour fight involving travellers at a camp near Edinburgh. Codona admits that gypsies enjoy a good old scrap. Anyone who fancies a fight with a gypsy need only ask and boxing remains the preferred way of settling differences.</p> <p>Even so, Codona's daily ritual is designed to minimise conflict with the 'settled' community. A typical day begins at dawn. In the absence of horses Codona, a Romany who has traced his family back to 1770, checks the health of his nine dogs before heading off to work. Work can mean anything. Cadona's generation cannot read or write, so have become experts at repairing, cleaning and breaking apart anything, often scrap metal, whose value can be increased at the local car-boot sale each week. A jacuzzi, acquired in return for some fencing, sits among the undergrowth close to their caravan. Toy tractors are strewn across the lawn, near the barbecue where the family gathers most summer evenings. Behind them lie rolling fields where Codona plans to build tennis courts if he can somehow find a way to stay. 'It would be fantastic if the settled community could pop in for a game, barristers, lords policemen. And I'd cook them all salmon for dinner,' he smiled. </p> <p>Eight years ago, along with 27 families, he bought the 17 acres around him. A green was built for the children to play in. Travellers who brought trouble were barred. Children refused entry by local schools were taught to read and write. A strict code of behaviour ensured teenagers stayed out of mischief, although Codona dismisses the notion that gypsies only stay with their own: his daughter has married a man from the settled community. </p> <p>For a few years they lived in their utopia. Then, one by one, the council tore apart the community, often evicting with force. Now Codona faces life in a bed-and-breakfast or possible imprisonment, which terrifies him: 'I'd rather die than live in claustrophobia. Being a gypsy is a way of life, our religion.'</p>",
  "<p>Toilets and bathrooms in NHS hospitals have become dirtier over the past year, according to a nationwide survey of patients. The report casts doubt on the government's claims that hospitals are becoming cleaner. </p> <p>The survey, among more than 86,000 patients, shows that, across England, 48 per cent felt hospital toilets and bathrooms were very clean, but 13 per cent were not happy. This compared with the previous year, when 51 per cent described bathrooms as very clean. </p> <p>Hospitals in and around London appeared to have a particularly low satisfaction rating on hygiene. Kingston Hospital in Surrey comes out worst, with 38 per cent of patients saying they thought the washing facilities were 'not very, or not at all clean'. Specialist hospitals with fewer patients had the highest ratings. </p> <p>However the survey, the second to be carried out nationwide, did give signs of improvement elsewhere. It showed that more patients felt nurses were giving them understandable answers. People also thought waits were shorter in accident and emergency departments. </p> <p>Hygiene matters because, while the superbug MRSA is mostly spread by staff not washing their hands between patients, there are other bugs that can cause stomach infections that are more likely to breed in wet bathrooms. </p> <p>The Norwalk virus, also known as norovirus, is spread through poor hygiene and leads to vomiting and diarrhoea. It can lurk in dirty bathrooms and lavatories and be spread on droplets of vomit. Cleaners who fail to wear protective gloves can spread norovirus from patient to patient, while contaminated food and water can also transmit the infection. </p> <p>The survey, by the Healthcare Commission, also showed that there was greater satisfaction over hygiene on wards. Nearly 90 per cent of patients felt that their room or ward was clean, with just 9 per cent unhappy at the level of hygiene. </p> <p>Simon Williams, of the Patients' Association, said that there was still enormous dissatisfaction over hospital toilets and bathrooms. </p> <p>'We've found a huge variation between trusts over how often they are cleaned,' he added. 'We are working with the NHS to try to tighten standards of cleanliness, to set out what you can expect when you walk into a washing area or a toilet.' </p> <p>Janet Shepherd, director of nursing at Kingston Hospital NHS Trust, said its standards had improved since the survey was conducted eight months ago, though they were aware that they needed to do better. 'Last month the local Public and Patient Involvement Forum carried out a cleanliness spot-check on our main wards, including the bathroom facilities. It was generally satisfied with the levels of cleanliness.' </p> <p>But the issue of why hospitals are still failing to clean wards and bathrooms enough continues to vex the public. Vulnerable patients, such as the elderly and cancer sufferers, are particularly at risk because their immune systems are weakened. </p> <p>Health secretary John Reid announced last year that 'infection tsars' would be appointed in every hospital in England to try to improve infection control. More money has also been made available to trusts to increase the number of cleaning staff. </p> <p><strong>The dirty ten</strong></p> <p><strong>NHS Trust, toilets dirty(%)</strong> </p> <p>Kingston Hospital 38 </p> <p>Ealing Hospital 30 </p> <p>Kings College Hospital 27 </p> <p>Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals 27 </p> <p>East and North Hertfordshire 24 </p> <p>Plymouth Hospitals 24 </p> <p>Countess of Chester Hospital 22 </p> <p>Barts and the London 22 </p> <p>Milton Keynes General 21 </p> <p>Luton and Dunstable Hospital 21 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Figures are percentage of patients surveyed who said toilets and bathrooms were not very or not at all clean.

  "<p>BP faces a bidding war for control of a key Russian gas venture owned by embattled Russian energy group Yukos. </p> <p>The British oil giant has been told it will have to pay around $500 million to buy Yukos out of Rospan, the coveted gas production unit in which BP already has a 44 per cent stake. </p> <p>BP said last week it was willing to pay Yukos $357m to acquire the remaining 56 per cent, but a group of Russian investment banks has since offered $450m for the holding. </p> <p>A source close to Yukos told The Observer that it expected BP to win any auction because of the British company's existing stake in Rospan, which it holds through Russian subsidiary BP-TNK. But Yukos hopes that the price can be forced up to $500m by the bidding. </p> <p>Yukos is desperate to raise money to pay off a $3.4 billion back-taxes demand from the Russian government. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, its chief executive and principal shareholder, is currently facing charges of tax evasion and fraud, and the company is threatened by imminent bankruptcy. </p> <p>However, freezing orders applied to various parts of the group could stymie an asset sale.

However, there has been no public response from the Kremlin. </p> <p>Russia's largest oil company has also warned that it may not even have enough to cash to pay its bills unless the freezing orders are lifted, raising the prospect of disruptions in production.

  "It is one of the ultimate macho sports: a potent combination of dirt, diesel and danger. Every weekend thousands of men slide behind the wheel of a seemingly indestructible four-wheel drive vehicle to drive where few have ventured before. With their thick tyres and rugged suspensions, the off-road Jeeps and buggies devour the mud give their occupants a thrilling, bone-shaking ride. <p>Not for much longer, however. Alarmed at claims that off-road vehicles are tearing up Britain's countryside, the government is to get tough on the thrill seekers. </p> <p>Rural Affairs Minister Alun Michael wants to tighten up ancient laws permitting motorbikes, quadbikes and 4x4s to roar across the countryside. Currently enthusiasts are legally entitled to drive down byways known as 'green lanes', the muddy roads next to fields which were capable of taking a horse and cart. Known as 'boats'- 'byways open to all traffic' - the routes are also popular with ramblers who have campaigned to have them outlawed to off-roaders. </p> <p>Now Michael, who has just completed a wide-ranging consultation exercise involving submissions from more than 15,000 interested parties, has said rules governing access to 'green lanes' need to change. 'The basic proposition is: does it make sense that because horse and carts were allowed down these routes hundreds of years ago we should give free access to motorised vehicles? Frankly I don't think it does.' </p> <p>David Robinson, trails adviser with the Lake District National Park Authority, said off-road vehicles were doing huge damage to the countryside. 'A two-tonne Land Rover can loosen up a track that was previously solid and gouge out huge ruts in the surface. Some find it difficult to go around tight bends, so they end up taking the entire bank out.' </p> <p>Off-roaders are also accused of ruining the tranquility of some of Britain's most beautiful scenery. Mountaineer Chris Bonington has complained about the effects of off-road vehicles on the 6,000-year-old Ridgeway in Wiltshire, accusing them of turning a 'once beautiful part of England into a national disgrace'. </p> <p>The authority, which has seen a huge rise in off-roading activity in the past five years, has called for blanket ban on dirtbikes and 4x4s using national parks. 'They are for people who want to get away from the stress of work and urban living,' Robinson said. 'The last thing people want is motorcycles and 4x4s 1,500 feet up in the hills. </p> <p>The government has drawn up a list of strategies to clamp down on the off-road lobby which is likely to fiercely contest any attempts to bar its members from the byways. In the past couple of years enthusiasts have launched a series of legal bids to assert their rights to access byways in a bid to defend their sport. </p> <p>Alastair Read, a member of the Shire Land Rover Club, said: 'Contrary to popular opinion, we don't go tearing around. We just want to have a bit of fun. The problem is that, just as in any walk of life, a minority ruin it for the majority.' </p> <p>Read said that off-roaders had become 'the number one hate figure' for the Ramblers' Association, which ignored the fact many 4x4 clubs kept the byways clear for use. In addition, he said, many ramblers seemed unaware that cars and bikes were allowed on byways, providing they had MoT certificates and were taxed. </p> <p>'I was driving in Wales and a rambler steps out and smashes his stick on my bonnet. He said: 'What are you doing in the middle of the footpath?' I said: 'What are you doing in the middle of the road?' </p> <p>Nigel Leak, editor of <a href=\"http://www.4x4web.co.uk\">4x4web.co.uk</a>, an online fanzine for off-road enthusiasts, said they were legally allowed to use only around three per cent of the 140,000 miles of rural paths in Britain: 'In reality, there is lots of space. If everybody followed the law, there would not be a problem. But the reality is that some people do not.' </p> <p>The lack of common ground between both sides of the debate, coupled with the complexity of updating ancient land use laws, could prove a nightmare for the government. 'It's a bit of a minefield in the sense that people feel very strongly one way or the other in this, creating a direct conflict of interest,' Michael admitted. </p> <p>He was alarmed, however, by the attitude of some off-road groups and was determined to take action: 'You click on some websites and see people celebrating the fact that 50 4x4s drove in convoy along a particular set of green lanes. It's difficult to understand the mentality of someone who thinks that's an enjoyable day out.'</p>",
  "Jailed loyalist icon Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair has been refused compassionate parole to visit his cancer-stricken wife. <p>However, the former UFF commander has denied he is being transferred from Maghaberry prison, outside Belfast, to a jail in England. </p> <p>Rumours about Adair's alleged move to England came about after he was recently moved out of Maghaberry's Mourne House to another part of the prison where no one else is held. But the 40-year-old denied he wanted to serve out his sentence in England to be closer to his wife, Gina. </p> <p>Within the past few months, the mother of his four children has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She is undergoing chemotherapy treatment in a hospital in the Greater Manchester area. </p> <p>Speaking from jail yesterday, Adair confirmed that his application to see his wife was turned down on security grounds. </p> <p>'Gina was diagnosed a few months ago with ovarian cancer,' said Adair, who is into the last five months of his 16-year sentence for directing UFF terrorism. 'She hasn't been able to visit me for a while so I applied to the prison governor for compassionate parole to go and see her. The application came back saying it had been refused on security grounds. </p> <p>'Apparently, the police are saying I am too high a risk to let me out for a compassionate visit.' </p> <p>Adair also revealed that he had applied to see his son Jonathan in England. The 19-year-old is locked up in a young offenders centre in England where he is serving a five-year sentence for conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. </p> <p>Jonathan was arrested last December after greater Manchester police officers swooped on five addresses in the Bolton area during a covert probe into class A drug-dealing. </p> <p>He and his 22-year-old friend Ben Dowie, were arrested at a hotel on the M61 at Anderton as part of Operation Margate. </p> <p>During the raids police recovered a fake M16 machine gun, four imitation handguns, body armour, a crossbow and \u00a31,000 in cash. </p> <p>Adair said yesterday that his application to see his son in the young offenders' centre had also been turned down. 'Because we are in prison, either Jonathan could come to see me or I could go to see him for a visit,' he said. </p> <p>'But my application has been rejected again on security grounds, with the police saying I am too much of a security risk.'</p>",
  "<p>'The days of cheap energy in the UK are coming to an end,' says Phil Bentley, financial director of Centrica. </p> <p>There is no reason to disbelieve him. Indeed 'cheap energy' policies are a mirage. It is a basic law of economics that what goes down also comes up, usually sooner rather than later. Politicians do not get much credit when utility bills are falling, or at least rising by less than inflation. But when they start to rebound, as Centrica and others now say is inevitable, the public does not necessarily blame only market forces. </p> <p>The gas and electricity regulator, Ofgem, is ideologically in thrall to achieving the lowest possible prices for the consumer. This is an extremely short-term approach which subordinates other government objectives of at least equal importance. There was also more than a touch of emperor's clothes to the magical success of driving down prices in an over-supplied market. </p> <p>This over-capacity was a legacy from the old state-run systems, when it was regarded as a virtue to produce more electricity than the nation was likely to consume. This produced security of supply in a non-competitive environment. Only in the brave new world of competition did over-capacity became a badge of inefficiency rather than prudence, and non-viable generators go to the wall. </p> <p>The most conspicuous victim was British Energy, our leading nuclear generator. British Energy, as its shareholders are beginning to note, is now doing rather well because of the recovery in electricity prices. This confirms that the major factor in its crisis - the unsustainably low price of generated electricity - was a temporary phenomenon. The bill for more expensive electricity, which consumers were not asked to pay for around two years, was passed instead to taxpayers in the form of a bail-out for BE, which will last for decades. </p> <p>Another problem with a purely market-driven approach is its blindness to environmental virtue. It makes more sense under Ofgem's regime to bring dirty generation out of mothballs to meet demand than it does to invest in clean new plant. The wholesale price of electricity must take greater account of the increasingly desperate need for investment in clean generating capacity. But that approach - which would also bring relief to the beleaguered power manufacturing sector - is incompatible with a 'cheapest is best' preoccupation. </p> <p>The classic example of how a hostile - or at best indifferent - regulatory regime can work against other stated government objectives lies in the Combined Heat and Power sector. It is often forgotten that government targets for CHP are more ambitious than for higher-profile renewables. In reality however, CHP has been in decline over the past few years, caught in a ratchet of low electricity and high gas prices. As with renewables, setting targets is the easy bit - there then has to be action to ensure 'the market' does not make them unachievable. </p> <p>So as we move into an era where 'the days of cheap energy are coming to an end', what are the implications for UK policy? I would argue that the biggest danger comes from the proposed dependence, to an extraordinary degree, on imported gas - one of the most volatile factors in recent price movements. Indeed, Centrica is predicting it will cost it 50 per cent more to buy gas over the next two years. Flashing red warning signs do not come much brighter. </p> <p>On current projections, 70 per cent of our electricity generation will come from gas by 2020. Ninety per cent of that will be imported from areas such as Siberia, the Caspian Sea, North Africa and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. No matter what happens now, we are going to become hugely more dependent on imported gas at the time when our own North Sea resources - which led to the short-term dash for gas in the first place - are in sharp decline. By 2006, we will become a net importer of gas. </p> <p>The market is already responding with large-scale investment and long-term contracts. Centrica has indicated its plans to build an LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal to ship gas to the UK and similar projects are sprouting around our coastline. Similarly, a number of major pipeline concepts will bring gas to Western Europe and, by inter-connector, to the UK. </p> <p>So my concern is not one of absolutes but of degrees. Of course we will need imported gas, and of course the market will respond. But does it make sense to become so dependent on one price-volatile source of energy? </p> <p>My own firm view is that our future dependence on imported gas should be tempered by an all-out effort to maximise our indigenous energy potential - nuclear, clean coal and renewables as well as maximising production from whatever is left in the North Sea. </p> <p>Thinking environmentalists such as James Lovelock are already crossing the psychological barrier that sees nuclear power as an implacable enemy. More rational assessment suggests it is actually the other side of the same carbon-reduction coin as renewables. Similarly, we will continue to turn our back on coal at our peril. We still have lots of the stuff under our feet and, globally, more can be achieved for carbon reduction by cleaning up coal plants than will ever come from renewables. As a bonus, British companies could be selling the technology to the world. </p> <p>Security of energy supply is too important to be left to the market and too political to be left to an unelected regulator. Nobody will blame a regulator if the lights go out or prices go through the roof. They will, very properly, hold responsible the politicians who led them to believe in the sustainability of cheap energy and the wisdom of gas dependence. Affordability of energy supply is crucial to a successful economy, but 'cheap energy' is fool's gold. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Brian Wilson MP was Energy Minister from 2001 to 2003 and is currently the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Overseas Trade</p>",
  "It is the language of Goethe, the Brothers Grimm and Bertolt Brecht. But an official attempt to reform German has provoked an unprecedented denunciation of the changes by writers, publishers and literary critics as 'stupid and confusing'. <p>A committee of bureaucrats introduced the reforms - known as neue Rechtschreibung, or new spelling - six years ago to make the complex language easier to learn. Since then opposition to the changes has grown. It culminated in Germany's two leading publishing houses, Axel Springer and Der Spiegel, announcing on Friday that their publications would revert to the old spelling. </p> <p>The reforms had failed, the publishers said, providing neither 'enlightenment nor simplicity'. They urged other newspapers to follow the example of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which had gone back to old spelling. </p> <p>Leading literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki dismissed the changes last week as a 'national catastrophe'. In an essay, he declared: 'Chaos has broken out ... In no other major European country is the gap so deep between the language of the people and the language of literature.' </p> <p>G\u00fcnter Grass and other members of Germany's literary establishment have refused to allow their books to be printed using the new forms. Even page three girls have joined the rebellion. A model called Theresa, wearing only orange knickers, told Axel Springer's tabloid Bild she had her doubts about the wisdom of abandoning classical German orthography. </p> <p>Under the new rules, the old-fashioned double S or S-Zett in German - which looks like a fat B - has been replaced in some cases with a double 'ss'. Other words have been capitalised for the first time, while compound verbs like radfahren - to ride a bike - have been split up, into Rad fahren. </p> <p>Although the changes only affect 5 per cent of the vocabulary, they have provoked widespread confusion. They also appear to have been rejected by most Germans. But Professor Rudolf Hoberg, a member of the committee that introduced the changes, was unapologetic. 'The changes are sensible. They make German simpler. I believe the language is substantially better off as a result.' </p> <p>Others are unconvinced. 'The reforms are simply stupid. These sorts of things happen when the state meddles in areas which shouldn't concern it,' Dr Friedrich Dietman, a writer and the vice-president of Saxony's Academy of Arts, said. </p> <p>Germany's leaders have already gone over to the new spelling, which from next August will become compulsory for every German official. But there are signs of a growing political revolt, with the heads of three of the federal states - all of them run by the right-wing opposition CDU party - announcing that they want to go back to the old rules. The federal culture ministers will discuss the subject in October. </p> <p>What would Goethe, and other dead German authors, have made of the row? 'We only agreed on a unified German spelling a century ago,' Roberg said. 'Goethe spelled his name several different ways. I don't think he would have cared.'</p>",
  "Uninsured drivers will have their cars confiscated on the spot, and risk having them crushed, under a crackdown to tackle a growing underclass of illegal motorists. <p>The clampdown comes amid serious concerns that up to one million people are thought to be driving around Britain without cover. They are blamed for a rise in hit-and-run crashes: the uninsured cause up to nine times as many accidents as legal motorists, and fear of being caught without papers - particularly among those who are also untaxed and unlicensed - makes them more likely to flee.</p> <p>However, the RAC warned yesterday that stiffer penalties were not the answer for some young drivers, who find it 'almost impossible' to afford insurance, with premiums of up to \u00a32,000 in some inner cities. </p> <p>Ministers will unveil plans this week for tougher penalties - which could include community service as well as higher fines - and more effective detection of the uninsured. Currently if police catch an uninsured driver, they issue a penalty ticket but are powerless to stop the person driving off - a situation ministers describe as 'ludicrous'. In future, drivers would be dumped at the roadside and required to hand over their keys. </p> <p>Confiscation has been successfully trialled in West Yorkshire, where seized cars are impounded. Drivers are charged \u00a3105 plus VAT to get their car released with proof of insurance; otherwise they abandon their claim to the car - which will then be crushed. </p> <p>RAC spokesman Edmund King backed tougher penalties for repeat offenders but warned the insurance industry also had a role to play. 'If people have had a string of convictions, something else needs to be done and confiscation must be an option,' he said. </p> <p>'There is an element of uninsured drivers who basically can't afford it, and it is thought they could be brought back within the law if they were given innovative ways of paying.' Under-25s living in big cities could find it 'almost impossible' to drive legitimately, he said: with fines averaging only \u00a3150-\u00a3200 against premiums of up to \u00a32,000, many calculate it is worth the risk. </p> <p>The Department for Transport's plans follow a report it commissioned from academic David Greenaway, delivered to ministers earlier this summer. Greenaway is understood to have identified a phenomenon of young inner city males, sharing a car but failing to tax or insure it. </p> <p>Detection will also be made easier, with police allowed access to insurance databases to check who is not covered, by matching the information against details held by the DVLA. The new generation of roadside cameras would be able to recognise the numberplates of uninsured drivers and issue automatic tickets. </p> <p>The Tories have pledged to introduce confiscation if they got into power. Damian Green, transport spokesman, said ministers had failed to adopt a crucial part of their plan: </p> <p>'The fatal flaw here - and the big difference between us - is whether you actually enforce these bigger penalties. We have lost more than 1,000 traffic police in the last few years and one of the side effects of the over-reliance on cameras is that there aren't any police around to catch these uninsured drivers.' </p> <p>The new police powers could become law before an election next year.</p>",
  "Iraq's interim government moved yesterday to defuse the country's rampant and bloody anti-American insurgency by signing a long-awaited amnesty law. <p>The move will pardon Iraqis who have committed minor crimes against US or Iraqi government officials, but it will not include those who have killed US soldiers, Iraqis or any hostages. </p> <p>The move comes as violence continued to grip the holy city of Najaf and other southern Iraqi cities, with US troops and Iraqi soldiers embroiled in fierce battles with the militant army of the radical Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The bloodshed is deeply threatening to the government of interim Prime Minister Ayed Allawi, who is also a Shia, seen by many Iraqis as owing his position to the Americans. </p> <p>Last night insurgants fired ten mortar bombs and rockets in central Baghdad. Some landed near the Green Zone compound housing the interim Iraqi government and the US embassy, although there were no immediate reports of casualties. </p> <p>The wide-ranging amnesty is seen as a key plank in trying to end the insurgency which has shown no sign of easing since the handover of sovereignty to Allawi's government in June. </p> <p>In another sign that Allawi is keen to offer an olive branch to the insurgents, he said that many of the fighters in Najaf were not true supporters of al-Sadr. He labelled them 'common criminals' and said al-Sadr was still welcome to take part in national elections scheduled for Janu ary. Allawi also strongly hinted that no attempt would be made to arrest al-Sadr, who is wanted for murdering a rival cleric. Iraqi officials say they do not know the whereabouts of al-Sadr, but a defence ministry source said last night that he was thought to be hiding in Baghdad. </p> <p>Fighting was continuing in Najaf, albeit at a lower intensity than in the previous two days, when US troops claimed to have killed more than 300 members of al-Sadr's militia. Skirmishes involving al-Sadr loyalists also persisted in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, where fighting has killed at least 35 people and wounded 180. There was also further violence in the southern cities of Amara and Basra. But nearby Nasiriya was reported to be quiet as a ceasefire took hold. </p> <p>Many observers are hoping that the amnesty will prove more important than any victory on the battlefield in defusing the continuing fighting. The plan caused a scandal in the US when it was first revealed several weeks ago as American officials feared it would grant amnesty to those who had killed US soldiers. But pressure from Washington removed that possibility, and Allawi was clear that all those with blood on their hands would face justice. </p> <p>'This amnesty is not for people ... who have killed. Those people will be brought to justice,' Allawi said. It will forgive those who committed minor crimes between 1 May, 2003, just after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, and Saturday, he said. Those eligible will have to turn themselves in over the next 30 days. </p> <p>The fresh outbreak of violence among Iraq's Shias is the worst outbreak of fighting since the fall of Baghdad last year. Containing it and ending the parallel Sunni insurgency around the capital is now seen as the vital test for Allawi's government. </p> <p>However, observers doubt whether a much-vaunted, and delayed, conference to elect an interim national assembly will be able to go ahead as planned. In a move that raised questions about the interim government's commitment to free speech, Allawi announced a one-month ban on the operations of Arab satellite television channel al-Jazeera in Iraq, accusing it of inciting violence and encouraging the insurgency. </p> <p>The move was swiftly condemned by Arab journalists. Al-Jazeera has angered many Iraqi government figures for its broadcasting of messages from insurgent groups and other organisations that have taken hostages. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Turkish employers of a driver taken hostage in Iraq have agreed to stop operating in the country after his captors threatened to behead him unless his company withdrew from Iraq within 48 hours. Last week another Turkish hostage was shot dead by his captors.</p>",
  "<p>There's not a greasy burger in sight. These days, McDonald's is for ladies who lunch: the fast food giant currently features attractive, sophisticated thirty-something women in its adverts, laughing over their McSalad-leaves. </p> <p>And what's this? Wholesome-sounding 'educational' ads on children's TV, 'using songs to help children learn about eating smart and being active', presented by... Ronald McDonald. </p> <p>If this seems inappropriate, the point hasn't been lost on politicians and health campaigners. 'I'm very sceptical about this projection of a healthy message by McDonald's,' says David Hinchliffe, chairman of the House of Commons health committee. 'It would be better if they were looking at the energy content of their food, and the pressure they bring to bear on children and young people to consume a less than healthy product.' </p> <p>His committee recently declared the 'epidemic' of obesity one of Britain's most urgent public health problems. In America, McDonald's is fending off lawsuits from large-waisted former customers. And the burger-and-chips behemoth has also just been traduced by a New York film-maker who recorded his own descent into serious illness while living on a McDonald's-only diet. Super Size Me, a surprise hit in the US, hits British cinemas soon. </p> <p>So is McDonald's much-publicised conversion to salad, sport and mineral water just a desperate rearguard action against bad PR? Or is it a ruse to get more punters to the burger counter? </p> <p>Not at all, says Amanda Pierce, McDonald's spokeswoman in Britain. 'There's a heck of a lot of variety in the menu now, and we're trying to make sure that McDonald's is relevant and contemporary. We're a restaurant business and we have to recognise that our customers' tastes and expectations have changed.' </p> <p>McDonald's may be the one of the most successful brands in history but, in strictly commercial terms, it needs revamping. Under pressure from pizza and tex-mex chains, and perceived as out of step with an increasingly body-conscious society, in 2002 the Chicago-based corporation announced its first loss for decades. Its response was to ditch the age-old strategy of neverending global expansion and concentrate on improving the 30,000 restaurants it already had. </p> <p>The company promised to reduce artery-clogging 'trans-fats' in its frying oil. 'Healthier' items were added to the menu - salads, grilled chicken, fruit and yoghurts. Some gigantic burgers and drinks cartons have been downsized. </p> <p>The strategy seems to have worked: before his untimely death earlier in April, McDonald's chief executive Jim Cantalupo delivered an annual turnover of $17 billion, increasing profits and a near-doubling of the share price. Business is booming, not least in the chain's 1,200 British outlets. </p> <p>But people aren't going to the 'golden arches' for apples and lettuce. Our appetite for salty snacks and sugary drinks remains undimmed, as this year's government White Paper on obesity is expected to show. Britons are getting fatter faster than any of their European counterparts, with one in five adults now classed as dangerously overweight, and a quarter of children under 10 at risk of heart disease and diabetes in later life. </p> <p>In the US, the proportion of overweight adults has soared to about 65 per cent. The World Trade Organisation blames the food industry, and JP Morgan recently warned that Big Food faced a future of restricted marketing and massive health compensation claims. </p> <p>The industry's biggest companies are scrambling to head off the threat, cutting portion sizes and reviewing ingredients, and McDonald's, the best-known name in fast food, is no different. It has been handing out 'stepometers' to encourage customers to exercise, sponsoring the Olympic Games and England's football team, and pouring millions into Every Step Counts, an exercise campaign fronted by athletes Darren Campbell and Sharron Davies. </p> <p>None of which changes the fact that many items in its salad menu contain even more fat and calories than some of its burgers. Just in case voluntary 'improvements' don't protect it, the food industry has lobbied strenuously for the 'cheeseburger bill', which was passed in March by the US House of Representatives and restricts the ability of Americans to sue food companies for making them fat. Whether the bill will be ratified by the Senate, is another matter. </p> <p>McDonald's has so far managed to repel obesity lawsuits in the US by appealing to common sense. 'Nobody is forced to eat at McDonald's,' said one judge in a recent verdict. 'It is not the place of the law to protect people from their own excesses'. The same judge, however, did not rule out the chance of other junk food lawsuits succeeding, and increasingly it is argued that some people are actually not in a position to choose what they eat wisely. </p> <p>Children, for example. Last month health groups were disappointed by Ofcom's decision not to ban junk food advertising during children's TV programmes. Younger customers are a core market for companies such as McDonald's, and the media regulator said such a ban would threaten the commercial viability of children's TV, as well as being ineffective. Still, the government is keeping an open mind on a ban. </p> <p>Whether fast food companies improp erly target children in their advertising is a debating point of long standing, but it becomes hugely pertinent if the product is found to be addictive. Recent scientific research suggests that a combination of high-fat and high-sugar foods creates biochemical reactions in the body similar to those in people addicted to cigarettes. </p> <p>If verified, the research could undermine McDonald's claim that people are responsible for their own overeating. Unsurprisingly, this is an issue that fascinates America's lawyers. Tobacco firms there have already been forced to pay tens of billions of dollars in compensation after being accused of marketing highly addictive products and failing properly to warn the public about health risks. </p> <p>John Banzhaf, a US attorney who helped spearhead much of the anti-tobacco litigation, has since piloted legal actions against McDonald's. He estimates that the burger giant could one day face compensation demands totalling between $50bn and $100bn. Much of this, Banzhaf says, could come from America's healthcare system, which spends around $120bn each year treating people for obesity-related illnesses. </p> <p>It's a thought to wipe the smile off even Ronald's face.</p>",
  "<p>There was good news from the airlines last week. Perky low-cost carrier Ryanair exceeded market expectations and trumpeted record pre-tax profits of \u20ac57.8 million (\u00a338.5m) and a growth in traffic in the first quarter of the year - this after a profits warning in January that had everyone wondering whether the Irish carrier's garrulous boss, Michael O'Leary, had run out of updraft. </p> <p>Easyjet told us about a 28 per cent increase in passenger numbers year on year for the quarter, and added that its load factor - how full its planes are - was up from 85.6 per cent to 88.1 per cent over the same period. </p> <p>Meanwhile, British Airways announced healthy passenger figures, particularly on its vital North American routes - volumes up 5.1 per cent, load factor up as well. And Virgin expressed long-term confidence, ordering 13 new Airbuses and optioning a further 13 to service expansion around the world. </p> <p>Is recovery here? Don't bet on it yet. For a start, the airlines themselves were sending mixed messages. Although Ryanair highlighted profits growth and fattening of margins, it also pointed to weak yields - 6 per cent down in the quarter, with a fall of 5 to 10 per cent expected for the remainder of the summer, and double that range through what is expected to be a bloody price war with Europe's proliferating low-cost carriers in the winter. </p> <p>Easyjet chief executive Ray Webster did nothing to dispel June's downbeat message that spooked the market by mentioning weakness and the Y-word. </p> <p>BA followers will have to wait until tomorrow to find out what its numbers are. But given the competition on all routes, and the fact that the airline itself launched a transatlantic price war, the outcome is likely to be similar. </p> <p>These are all established players, so none is going to fall victim to a price war. Earnings for the rest of the year, however, could be under pressure. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the surging oil price has swung everyone's focus onto the airlines' fuel hedging positions. Hedging positions are set at different levels, different prices and over different time periods. BA, for example, has 45 per cent of its requirements hedged at $28.50 a barrel until March next year. This is low compared with other European flag carriers - Lufthansa has a 90 per cent position until December, albeit at $33. Meanwhile, Ryanair is hedged 80 per cent to November and 43 per cent to March at an undisclosed rate and Easyjet has 50 per cent until September, falling to 30 per cent by March. </p> <p>The simplest message from this is that positions are unwinding this year against a background of continued volatility, even if oil prices do not remain high. O'Leary says he believes prices will fall, and that he will re-hedge when they do. Not all oil watchers are so sanguine. </p> <p>Analysts believe revenues and yields are the key drivers of performance, but fuel represents the airlines' second highest cost. Although the relationship with a high oil price is imperfectly understood, it does represent a risk - particularly when coupled with continued uncertainty over yields. </p> <p><strong>Is Sir Ken's way the Safeway? Yes</strong><br> </p> <p>Turning Safeway into Morrison's was always going to be a sticky business. Those with long memories will recall much stroking of chins about this very matter when Sir Ken unveiled his bid for the chain back in January 2003. Some went so far as to say it was a reason not to sell the business to him. </p> <p>Ken insisted that it was do-able then and he sticks with the story now, unpalatable profits warning notwithstanding. Whether you stick with his ailing stock, or retreat like the so-far-anonymous institution that dumped its 1.2 per cent stake last month, depends on how convincing you find him. </p> <p>Have a look at the positives first. Four large stores have been converted so far and they have recorded a 37 per cent uplift in sales. The core business continues to motor ahead, with sales increasing 15.3 per cent to \u00a35.3 billion and a 13.2 per cent pre-tax profit rise to \u00a3319.9m in the 25 weeks to last February. </p> <p>Morrison looks like he will escape the opprobrium of the Office of Fair Trading by making the September deadline (just). He has sold off 29 of the 52 stores he was ordered to divest and has lined up Asda to buy another package. </p> <p>On the negative side, though, the conversion roll-out will not be completed any time before autumn 2006. Because Safeway now forms the bulk of the Morrison portfolio, there is plenty of potential for further drag on overall profits. There is no getting around the fact that Morrison has issued a profits warning - albeit the first for 37 years. Exceptionals, currently expected to be a combined \u00a335m, can go up as well as down. </p> <p>It comes down to this: history shows us that Ken Morrison is a fine retailer of food. The Safeway acquisition does not change that. Those investors with no stomach for the long wait will be tempted to view 2006/07, when analysts predict normal service will be resumed, as too far into the future. Anything might have happened between now and then - including a takeover of Sainsbury. </p> <p>Others will place their faith in Morrison's track record and sit tight. By nature medium-term thinkers, we would be tempted to sit with them.</p>",

It still hasn't arrived.<br><strong>NL, Cardiff</strong><br> </p> <p>Gulf Air didn't tell us it had cancelled the route, says Lastminute.com. Apparently it is normal practice for airlines to inform agents of changes so agents can tell clients. </p> <p>Lastminute.com has checked your booking history and confirmed this did not happen, creating what it calls an 'anomaly'. In compensation Gulf Air is giving you two complimentary tickets to Dubai with VIP treatment and Lastminute.com has accelerated your refund so the money has finally arrived. </p> <p><strong>Subsidence has cost me dear</strong><br> </p> <p>In 1998, I made a minor subsidence claim. In June, I phoned my broker to renew the buildings insurance but, for the first time, was asked to confirm that I had never suffered subsidence damage. </p> <p>I discovered that my broker of many years, Membership Services Direct (MSD), had been sold to Bishopscourt Affinity Solutions (BAS). BAS deals with a different underwriter, one which refuses to take on houses with a history of subsidence. The previous underwriter, who paid the claim, is a Lloyd's syndicate, Canopius, but they will not take me on now, even through a different broker.<br><strong>DS, Sheffield</strong> </p> <p>You are right to worry, because insurers do not willingly take on houses that have suffered subsidence and that makes your house difficult to sell. I discovered that BAS bought only part of MSD and the rest, though not your bit, went to Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society. Liverpool Victoria has no responsibility to you but has taken pity and agreed to offer you buildings insurance with subsidence cover for \u00a3305. </p> <p><strong>Headstone headache</strong><br> </p> <p>Is the cost of a headstone for the grave a legitimate funeral expense that can be charged to the deceased's estate? I am co-executor of my mother's will, with her partner of 20 years. He is also the residual beneficiary who gets everything left over and is unwilling to allow the cost of the headstone as it would eat into his final total. Does he have any rights over the cost of the headstone, or is it my decision as next of kin?<br><strong>RA, London</strong> </p> <p>The Inland Revenue allows the cost of tombstones and headstones to be deducted before calculating inheritance tax. But this is not an expense that can be paid by an estate, unless the will specifically says so. You can only appeal to your mother's partner. If he agrees, he is entitled to a say in the cost and style. Or you could pay for a headstone yourself. </p> <p><strong>More info, less holiday money</strong><br> </p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland charged me \u00a39.63 to withdraw \u20ac300 on holiday in the Canary Islands last December, a total cost of \u00a3222. I have used the same ATM on previous visits and the charges were nothing like this. A year earlier, for \u20ac300 the fee was only \u00a34 and I was debited \u00a3203.<br><strong>JMcI, Penarth</strong> </p> <p>Charges haven't increased but, since last August, they have been itemised, says RBS. </p> <p>Before, statements showed just the commission, which is 2.25 per cent, maximum \u00a34. Now an exchange rate transaction fee of 2.65 per cent is shown separately, adding \u00a35.63 to the price of \u20ac300. And your holiday money cost more last winter because the euro had strengthened. </p> <p><strong>Hoping to collect from Abbey</strong><br> </p> <p>My father-in-law was, I allege, mis-sold a with-profits bond by Abbey in December 2000. He was 73 and should have not moved his \u00a335,000 savings from a safe Abbey interest-bearing account to an equity-linked product. </p> <p>Now Abbey is demanding a \u00a36,000 'market value adjustment' (MVA) if he withdraws his money early, 17 per cent of his original investment. If Abbey agrees to settle, how much should we expect - the original amount or more?<br><strong>DC, Longworth</strong> </p> <p>The Ombudsman can uphold complaints when investors lose out after being wrongly advised to invest in with-profits funds or where firms failed to give clear information about MVAs in their policy documents. </p> <p>If Abbey accepts this policy was mis-sold, it should put him back to the position he would have been in if he had not taken the salesman's advice. So he would get his \u00a335,000 plus interest since December 2000. This could be the rate of interest paid on the savings account he had or Bank of England base rate plus 1 per cent compound. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Email Margaret Dibben at <a href=\"mailto:\" money.writes@observer.co.uk\">money.writes@observer.co.uk</a> or write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

  "<p>Channel 4 has appointed investment bank UBS to review its strategic options, prompting speculation that it is preparing to do a deal with the broadcaster Five. </p> <p>The two television channels have admitted to holding informal merger talks, although C4 has also had discussions with other broadcasters, including cable company Flextech. </p> <p>Chairman Luke Johnson believes Channel 4 needs to team up with a rival to protect its audience share as the number of digital channels available in British homes increases. </p> <p>Channel 4 is publicly owned but funded entirely by advertising and profits are badly hit if viewing figures fall. The channel made a small profit on revenues of \u00a3770 million last year, but had been in the red in 2002. </p> <p>Former chief executive Mark Thompson began a debate on C4's future by talking about transferring ownership to a not-for-profit trust. That would require a change in the law to allow a full-blown merger, and it is believed that some board members oppose this option. </p> <p>The hiring of UBS marks the first time the board has sought outside advice and offers the clearest sign yet that C4's new chief executive, Andy Duncan, wants to continue the process Thompson began. Five and C4 first talked last year, but the process is said to be 'painfully slow'. Talks stalled after Thompson left for the BBC . </p> <p>Five, controlled by German broadcaster RTL, is also facing stiffer competition. One of its largest shareholders, United Business Media, is seen as a seller. But a merger could be blocked by the Treasury, which wants to avoid a 'back door privatisation'.</p>",
  "<p>Ruth and David from Yorkshire, now 56 and 55, are starting to regret their misspent youth. She writes: </p> <p>If there was a bad decision we could take with regard to money we seem to have taken it. When we were young we lived rather a hippy lifestyle but now feel we are facing rather a grim financial future. </p> <p>Despite our hippy roots, we have worked hard all our lives as university lecturers but we have never been highly paid. I stopped fulltime work a few years ago due to illness and am currently teaching evening classes, though I am considering going back full-time. </p> <p>Apart from our pensions, we have no savings. My pension will only be \u00a32,000 on retirement. My husband, who earns \u00a340,000 a year, and has been paying into his occupational pension scheme since about 1978, is expecting a pension of \u00a39,556 at 65. He also pays additional voluntary contributions. </p> <p>Over the years, we have bought half a dozen houses but have never made much profit. We currently have an interest-only tracker mortgage of \u00a3105,000 on a property worth 230,000. </p> <p>The worst news is the performance of the several endowment policies we have taken out. All have predicted shortfalls. One is with Friends Provident. We complained to Halifax, which sold us the policy, but it rejected our complaint, so we haven't bothered to complain about the others, which are with Prudential and Standard Life. </p> <p>The endowments would not have covered the whole of our mortgage anyway. The balance is on a purely interest-only basis. We plan to move to a smaller property when the mortgage is due for repayment in 2014 and pay off the loan that way. </p> <p>Should we cash in the endowments? Is it worth keeping the Standard Life policy for the windfall? Should we change to a repayment mortgage? And how can we save when we do not seem to have an extravagant lifestyle - we do not smoke or drink or have holidays? </p> <p>We have a credit card balance with Mint for \u00a31,800, at present interest-free, and our overdraft usually runs at \u00a3800. I am not sure why.</p> <p><strong>Don't worry - it's not as bad as you think</strong></p> <p>Your decision-making may not have been as bad as you think. You now have a decent amount of equity in your property and both you and your husband have public sector, final-salary pensions that will be index-linked. This means at least you do not have to worry about your pension being hit by falling stock markets and decreasing annuity rates. </p> <p>You may also be better off in retirement than you think. </p> <p>John Turton, director of life and pensions at independent financial advisers Bestinvest, believes you may have underestimated your husband's pension. He says: 'As a lecturer and a member of the Federated Superannuation Scheme for Universities, in 2011 David would have \u00a316,500 per annum. Is Ruth looking at the amount David has accrued to date? To get a better idea David should ask the trustees for an estimate of his pension at age 65.' </p> <p>Both of you will also qualify for a basic state retirement pension, although your pension will probably be reduced as you have not been paying National Insurance contributions for several years. Apply for a forecast from the Department of Work and Pensions. In any case, according to Turton's calculations, your joint income in retirement is likely to be more than \u00a320,000 a year. </p> <p>However, your main immediate concern is with your endowments. Even though you failed with your first complaint, it may be worth complaining about your other endowments if you feel you were mis-sold. Go to the Consumers' Association website, <a href=\"http://www.endowmentaction.co.uk\">www.endowmentaction.co.uk</a> which will guide you through the process. </p> <p>As to whether you should continue with your policies or surrender them, even financial advisers find it difficult to give a definitive answer. Darryl Connor, associate director at independent financial advisers Towry Law, points out 'Surrendering endowments can be a costly business, especially near the end of the term if they are on a traditional with-profits basis. In many cases most of the value comes from a terminal bonus added at plan maturity. If an investor surrenders their plan early, this bonus - and therefore much of the value - may be lost or reduced.' </p> <p>He advises you to ask your insurance companies for details of the actual values as well as the surrender values. He says: 'If these figures are very close and the policy has a long time to go, it may be worth surrendering.' </p> <p>But Turton disagrees. He says: 'The good news is that the companies in question are not \"dogs\" and have active investment funds. Since bonuses are exponential as maturity looms, the prospect of holding on and maintaining contributions is probably the best option. It will also mean that David and Ruth will benefit from any windfall from Standard Life, which is expected to demutualise in 2006.' </p> <p>If you do decide to surrender any of your policies you must put the money towards reducing your mortgage. </p> <p>Your overriding priority should be to reduce your debts. It is vital that you gain control of your general spending before you reach retirement. Connor recommends you and your husband keep a diary of everything you spend each month. This way you will know exactly where all your money is going and it should help you to spot inessential spending you could cut. </p> <p>You must discipline yourselves to stop running up an overdraft each month as this tends to be an expensive way to borrow. If possible, you should then aim to repay your outstanding credit card balance before the end of the interest-free period. If not, move to another credit card with an interest-free period. </p> <p>Then there is your mortgage. You really must concentrate your resources on closing the gap between the balance and the expected payouts from the endowment. </p> <p>Connor believes converting the mortgage to repayment would be too costly for you and therefore it is best if you reduce it in chunks on a monthly or annual basis. There is nothing to stop you making overpayments each month to reduce your mortgage balance. Check the terms with your current mortgage lender. </p> <p><strong>Ruth's to-do list</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Check your husband's pension entitlement at age 65. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Request state pension forecasts from the Retirement Pension Forecasting Team on 0845 300 0168 or using form BR19 from your local DWP office. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Visit <a href=\"http://www.endowmentaction.co.uk\">www.endowmentaction.co.uk</a> for a step-by-step guide to complaining about your endowments. </p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Ask your endowment providers for the current actual and surrender values of your policies so you can decide whether surrendering is worthwhile.

  "Every summer the graduates of Britain's universities decide what to do with their lives. As in previous years, thousands will have rejected the ideals of public service and the excitement of setting-up their own businesses and decided instead to fill the gaps in the ranks of Britain's 250,000 accountants. <p>Britain has as many as the rest of the EU put together, and it's easy to see why. There's no state-guaranteed monopoly for engineers, factory workers, call-centre girls, small businessmen or women, computer programmers, inventors or any other wealth-creating trade. Indeed, when the working population's jobs head east they are told in thunderous voices that their sloth is being deservedly punished by the wrathful gods of the marketplace. But auditing can't go east. Every institution in Britain has to have its books audited by a member of one of the British accountancy associations.</p> <p>In theory they are the police officers of finance, forever on the lookout fraud and gross incompetence. In practice they differ from the police in one respect. Detectives are not allowed to sell 'extra services' to potential criminals. They might think twice before breaking up an international cocaine-smuggling racket if their force relied on that same ring for a large slice of its income. No similar pettifogging concerns about conflicts of interest constrain the accountancy racket. Accountants are free to sell advice on how to install IT or avoid taxes to the very managers they are meant to be policing on behalf of pension funds and employees. If they blow the whistle, they might lose the contracts, so the whistle has a tendency to stay in the pocket. </p> <p>It shouldn't be a surprise to learn that British accountants make a comfortable living. Management Today found that the average annual pay packet of British accountants in 2001 came to $117,000 (\u00a382,000), which was way ahead of their nearest rivals in Europe, the Swiss, who struggled to get by on $73,000 (\u00a351,000). </p> <p>Thrusting graduates have always aimed to hack their way to the top of one of the 'Big Four' accountancy firms - PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG or Deloitte - which dominate the global and British markets. The most ambitious will hope one day to emulate Mike Rake, the head of KPMG, who last year received a 45 per cent pay rise to take his salary to \u00a32.4 million. </p> <p>'What do you spend it on?' a reporter from the Sunday Times asked. 'Sixteen polo ponies,' Rake replied.</p> <p>In the past, Rake and his colleagues were partners who had unlimited liability for their partnership's debts. Like the Lloyd's names, they put everything they owned on the line, and their exposure must have caused the odd sleepless nights. Auditors had approved the accounts of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Enron, WorldCom, Equitable Life and many another grotesquely mismanaged company. Until New Labour came to power the threat that Rake and his fellow partners might be sued for presiding over a disaster should have troubled even the self-confident head of KPMG. Everything, the pied-\u00e0-terre in London, the home in Henley-on-Thames, the villa in Spain and the 16 polo ponies, could have gone. </p> <p>The example of Arthur Andersen provided a terrible warning. The Big Four were once the Big Five until Andersen approved the accounts of Enron and WorldCom and earned the imperishable distinction of failing to notice that the first and second biggest frauds in human history were going on under its nose. Andersen went bust because, understandably, no reputable organisation would go near it. The Bush administration reacted by making it all but impossible for auditors to sell other services to clients in the United States. What if Parliament was to enforce the same regulations here? </p> <p>If Enron wasn't bad enough, what of the policy holders of Equitable Life who are suing Ernst &amp; Young for several billion for their failure to warn that the mutual was heading towards a financial calamity? </p> <p>I don't know if Rake suffers from panic attacks. If he does, he will at least be able to reassure himself on one point: however calamitously the accountancy giants audit British business, his polo ponies will be safe. As this column has noted before, the most striking vice of New Labour is not its friendship with business - all modern governments have to make friends with business - but its anxiety to acquaint itself with the most notorious capitalists: the Mittals, the Hindujas, the Murdochs and, now I think of it, the Arthur Andersens. The Tories had banned Andersen from receiving government contracts after its perennially myopic auditors had failed to spot that tax-payers money was disappearing by the boot load from the DeLorean car plant in Belfast. </p> <p>Andersen responded by sucking-up to New Labour and waiting for a change of regime. Patricia Hewitt was hired by its consulting arm. Andersen's services were offered free of charge to Labour when it was in Opposition. When Tony Blair won the 1997 election, the unpleasantness about DeLorean was tidied away and government contracts began to flow Andersen's way again. In 2000, the government bowed to a long campaign by the accountancy giants and limited their liability. Partners could protect themselves by changing their partnership into a limited company. Better still, they could still be partners and retain all the tax advantages and freedom from public scrutiny partnerships brought until they were successfully sued - when they would be able to claim the immunities of the directors of limited companies. The personal assets of the partners - the pads in Chelsea, the piles in the Chilterns - couldn't be seized by bailiffs whatever alternative they choose. </p> <p>The old wisdom about never giving into bullies has held true. The Big Four weren't satisfied with the government's gracious treatment and upped their demands. With personal liability gone, they now want a cap on the damages their firms can be required to pay for negligence or fraud. If they don't get it, they warn that one of their number could go bust. The Big Four would become the Big Three and the group would offer an even less competitive service to the business world. As Rake put it, business 'can't afford to lose another accountancy firm'. </p> <p>From inside the City the apparently outrageous demand for benefit of the clergy for accountants makes a kind of sense. What, after all, are the Big Four worth? Their offices in central London should be fetch a fair price, and photocopiers, computer terminals and the rest. But what was the main asset, the unlimited liability of the partners to meet debts, was removed by an obliging Labour government. A successful action by Equitable Life against Ernst &amp; Young could close it down because Ernst &amp; Young may no longer have the assets to redress the claims of the victims of its alleged ineptitude.</p> <p>Needless to say, Patricia Hewitt's Department of Trade and Industry has been convinced and is all for going along with the Big Four's demands for lame duck accountants to be protected as an endangered species. </p> <p>But the rest of us may wonder that if claims for damages against accountancy firms can be capped, why shouldn't claims against any other business capped? Or claims against trade unions? Or hospitals? Or you? Or me? What incentive will there be for auditors to improve on their lamentable record if they receive fresh privileges? If they are hired by another Maxwell, why should they be any more concerned now about protecting pensioners from penury than they were in the 1980s?</p> <p>These columns normally end with a lament about the general worthlessness of New Labour's unprincipled ninnies. But for once there's a faint whiff of hope in the air. Last week the Office of Fair Trading said words to the effect that the Big Four should stop taking the mickey. Meanwhile institutional investors are lobbying against auditors being placed beyond the full reach of the law. According to rumour, they've been joined by Gordon Brown's Treasury. </p> <p>If the rumour is true, then delegates preparing for the Labour Party Conference should consider asking the Chancellor to overcome his notorious politeness and put Ms Hewitt in her place. The Labour Party wasn't founded to create a Milton Friedman world of socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor; where Mike Rake keeps his polo ponies while savers with Equitable Life lose their pensions.</p>",

  "Family amusement arcades are exposing children to 'hardcore' high-stakes gambling, thanks to new machines that have slipped through a loophole in the law, ministers have warned. <p>The new internet-based games allow players to stake up to \u00a3500 in cash on roulette - and they are being installed alongside ordinary fruit machines in arcades traditionally used by bored teenagers to while away the school holidays.</p> <p>But because the gambling is technically taking place offshore - the machines act as 'portals' to an internet roulette site, registered overseas, on which the game is actually played - the operators argue it is not covered by British laws which would restrict them to much lower stakes and places children cannot easily reach.</p> <p>Efforts by the Gaming Board to stop arcades stocking the games have become embroiled in legal argument with machines appearing in at least one large north London arcade and thought to be spreading to seaside resorts.</p> <p>'This is a loophole we have identified which exposes children to the risk of quite serious, hardcore internet gambling,' said Tessa Jowell, the Culture Secretary. 'There are only a few at present. But if the Gaming Board were to lose the legal case, then we could see these machine all over the place - sweetshops, shopping centres, swimming pools, anywhere children are unsupervised.' </p> <p>Ministers are now adjusting planned new gambling laws - already being drafted by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport - to ensure that the machines, operated in Britain by a firm called Contented Kiosks, are brought under regulatory control. </p> <p>Concerns about children using home computers to play online poker or roulette are already widespread, with a survey by National Children's Homes last week showing children as young as 11 can currently set up accounts with gambling sites. </p> <p>However, most such sites at least ask for payment by credit card - supposedly a barrier to younger teenagers who are unlikely to have cards of their own: the kiosks are worrying ministers because the game is played in cash, making it even easier for children to use them. Under the new laws, British firms operating gambling websites would face unlimited fines and the removal of their licences if they allow children to play, with spot checks to catch those who do not carry out the proper checks on age. </p> <p>The shake-up of gambling laws planned by Jowell would introduce stronger controls on some new forms of gambling but has been criticised by some campaigners for relaxing controls in other areas to allow the development of mega-casinos in seaside resorts. The Salvation Army has warned it will lead to an increase in problem and compulsive gambling. </p> <p>However, Jowell has argued that there are enough safeguards to protect children from the gambling boom. Britain now spends around \u00a363.8 billion on the industry, ranging from the Lottery to bookmakers and casinos: the biggest increase in recent years has been in ordinary betting on the Tote or through bookies, but online gambling is viewed as the major growth area for the future. </p> <p>A draft bill on the modernisation of gambling laws is expected to be included in this autumn's Queen's Speech, meaning legislation could be on the statute books by the election.</p>",
  "Working-class teenagers are to be encouraged to train as doctors in a \u00a39 million drive to break the class divide in medicine. <p>Four years after the row over Laura Spence, who was denied a place to read medicine at Oxford despite a predicted string of A-grade A-levels - sparking arguments that her state school background had counted against her - almost three-quarters of medical students are still from the top three social classes.</p> <p>The campaign will encourage children from other backgrounds to consider a career in the NHS, as well as urging adults in other careers to switch to medicine as mature students. </p> <p>John Hutton, the health minister, said the five-year project would open doors to teenagers from poor families who would never previously have considered medicines.</p> <p>'We need more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals and we need them from all walks of life,' he said. 'It is unacceptable that some people are held back because of their financial, social or cultural background.'</p> <p>However, the move threatens to cause controversy among those who argue that attacks on elitism have already gone too far. Such critics were angered when it emerged last week that up to 600 students have been admitted to medical school with fewer than three Cs at A-level under a programme offering places to students from difficult backgrounds who show promise but have not - often owing to a poor education - achieved grades as good as their wealthier peers. </p> <p>Medical school places are oversubscribed by more than two to one, with applications up by a fifth last year. However, research shows that the chances of a place are still not equal. Black students in particular are struggling to get on to training courses, while Asians are under-represented in nursing. </p> <p>Critics have argued that plans to charge top-up fees may deter working-class students from applying for medical courses because of the levels of debt likely to be accumulated over seven years. </p> <p>The move follows fierce debate about the changing nature of the profession. Professor Carol Black, president of the Royal College of Physicians, has warned that women doctors were being put off some high-pressure specialties because of family responsibilities. Since more women than men now go to medical school, the changing working patterns of doctors could affect the profession's ability to influence national life, she said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Spence who went to Harvard to study biochemistry after being rejected by Oxford, revealed that she is to return to Britain to start a postgraduate degree in medicine. She declined to say which university had accepted her.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wilt in Nowhere</strong><br>by Tom Sharpe<br>Hutchinson \u00a316.99, pp256</p> <p>It is now 33 years since Tom Sharpe's debut novel made its indelible mark on Britain's bookshelves. Set in apartheid South Africa and dripping blood from every page, Riotous Assembly depicted the gruesome massacre of 21 white police officers, following the horrific death of an innocent black man, blown apart by a four-barrelled, 10ft elephant gun. Written from his personal experience, it was about as breathtakingly bloody and brutally violent as the regime it was attacking. It was also extremely funny.</p> <p>With the 13 novels, the two TV series, and the film that have followed, Sharpe has become one of the most widely enjoyed comic writers in Britain, notorious for the sheer savagery of his books and the outrageously far-fetched situations he engineers in them.</p> <p>He is a man capable of the wittiest and most biting turns of phrase. But he also takes remarkable pleasure in schoolboy innuendoes and the most banal puns. Yet more unusual is the fact that he is wholly and refreshingly unapologetic about his tastes, and it is this which marks him from the pack.</p> <p>Indeed, there is only one person comparable to Sharpe in this respect, and that is his long-suffering alter-ego, Henry Wilt. Husband to the impossible Eva, father of the mischievous quadruplets, assistant lecturer (Grade 2) at Fenlands College of Arts and Technology, resident of 34 Parkview Avenue, and the hopeless victim of three of Sharpe's novels, Wilt first appeared in 1976: 'What sort of man was he? Wilt had no idea. An insignificant little man to whom things happened and for whom life was a chapter of indignities.' After a 20 year absence, he returns, as lost as ever, in Wilt in Nowhere.</p> <p>When Eva and 'the quads' go on a trip to visit Uncle Wally in America, Wilt escapes for a walking holiday determined to find a 'romantic, nostalgic England' and put the horrors of modern drudgery to one side. It is not long before Eva is being investigated for drug-trafficking, the quads are causing havoc across a 15-mile radius and Uncle Wally is having an apoplectic fit. Wilt, meanwhile, ends up unconscious in the garage of a local landowner, perpetuating a front-page scandal involving murder, arson, paedophilia and an extended but wholly inconclusive investigation by his old friend Inspector Flint.</p> <p>Never a man to shy away from a good thing once he's on to it, Sharpe employs a familiar set of ingredients: ferocious dogs, country mansions, bondage gear and multiple concussions. This time, however, they are combined with references to Iraq, a full-blooded attack on those 'arrogant Yanks' and a damning depiction of the NHS. It seems the social and political developments of recent years have not mellowed Sharpe's sense of humour in the slightest.</p> <p>Nor have they done anything to temper his books' ambivalent attitude towards women, their provocative portrayal of homosexuality and thorough enjoyment of all things scatological. In fact, Sharpe remains as suspicious of political correctness as ever, to the extent that he disregards it altogether. But it is precisely this intransigence on his own part which gains him his audience, giving voice to a deep-rooted part of English culture. With his fourteenth novel, he confirms once again that his position at the heart of British comedy is as assured as that of the seaside postcard.</p> <p>Over the course of his prolific career, Sharpe has been hailed as the king of slapstick, a satirist in the line of Wodehouse, and a major craftsman in the art of farce (a spoonerism he would no doubt enjoy). In Wilt in Nowhere, he shows himself to be all these and more: vengeful, chaotic, Swiftian in his tastes, cartoonish in his extremes, and above all wild and amusing.</p>",
  "<p>It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it. The places and spaces I've visited in search of stories for the interiors pages of this magazine include Valentino's yacht, which just happened to be moored off Capri for a few days in the middle of a trawl around the Mediterranean; the plush Manhattan pad of Sweetie, an A-list celebrity dog who kept his owner in dog biscuits by penning a column in a New York newspaper; and a Scottish eco-home made out of a whisky barrel. There have been houseboats, garden sheds, antique train carriages and a bender in the middle of a field in Wiltshire. People make their homes in the most unlikely places. And what is really extraordinary is not just where people set up home, but how they do it. They make it their mission to create the house beautiful, sourcing just the right tap, the exact shade of duck-egg blue, the ultimate bedside table. It is not so much the homes that are amazing as the time and energy and the tunnel vision many of us (you) have when it comes to decorating and (sometimes literally) building a nest. It really is inspiring. And although my own home is far from a show home (I just don't have the willpower or the DIY skills), I have to confess to stealing a few ideas from my own pages along the way. There was the plywood floor (thanks, Julie Verhoeven - I was tempted by your multicoloured vinyl tiles, too); the Moroccan tiles (mine are nothing compared to the acres that textile designer Hilde Smith had laid in her Shoreditch warehouse); and a bit of blackboard paint on the walls (an idea shared by Wayne Hemingway and Georgina Godley). So really, it's not me that's the expert, but the people I am lucky enough to meet. I'm just the nosy parker who gets to peep through the keyhole.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> What planet do the people whose homes you feature live on? Where's the mess, the kids' toys, the clutter, the dishes in the sink, the clothes drying on the radiators? Where do these people get the time and energy to make such perfect show homes? And where do they get their money? <br><strong>Mrs V Talbot, north London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I want to see other people's clutter as much as you do, if only to make myself feel better about my own home. Admittedly, most people (though not all) run the hoover and a duster round their home before we photograph it. Wouldn't you? And it is not simply a matter of having lots of money and throwing it at the space. Sure, sometimes people's homes reflect their personal fortunes, and money can buy you a great space, the state-of-the-art kitchen and the furniture that most of us can only fantasise about. But the homes we feature are not about displays of wealth. They are about people who have a passion for their personal environment. Some people are just incredibly organised. An uncluttered home is all about storage, and if you have enough cupboards, shelves, boxes and hidy-holes, you will be amazed at how much mess you can cram out of sight. But just to make you feel better, I have to report that most of the homes we photograph have at least one room that is strictly off-limits. I can only imagine that behind those doors lies all the usual stuff that clutters up most of our lives.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Now that every property developer up and down the country is using stainless steel and laminate floors, what's next? If I want my home to look different and stand out from the rest, what should I put on the floor, and what are the cool alternatives to stainless steel in the kitchen?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> I think cork tiles are set to make a comeback. Cork producers are looking for other outlets now that winemakers are opting for plastic stoppers. And though you might think it is very Seventies retro, cork is a fantastic solution to your flooring needs. It is warm and soft underfoot, looks great varnished, and is very eco-friendly. Even our ethical expert Lucy Siegle would approve. Just don't combine it with an avocado bathroom suite. Other good options include stripped floors (I don't think a good set of stripped floorboards will ever go out of fashion), parquet (expensive, but always a joy), untreated oak (if the Tate Modern can leave their floors untreated, you can, too) and lots of rugs for colour and texture - look at the Rug Company for inspiration and then hunt the high street for affordable versions. For kitchen worktops, go for recycled plastic, and for splashbacks, how about old-fashioned tiles? There are hundreds to choose from and it is an easy way to inject a bit of colour and personality into your kitchen.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> How do you decorate a room to make couches that look a bit too big look as though they fit? We got our couches finally, and I know I'm just used to no furniture but they are very big! Eeek. Can't take 'em back now. They are super comfy and lovely, but they look weird. <br><strong>Rebecca Gill, Dublin</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You should really think about selling them on eBay and starting again. Or move home. There is nothing you can do about furniture that is too big for a room. Rule number one when buying a big piece of furniture is to mark out the space with newspaper before you buy. That way you can be sure how much space the item will take up and whether it fits or not. Never buy big pieces of furniture on impulse.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I live in a fairly small cottage and my children (a girl aged nine and a boy aged seven) have to share a bedroom. The trouble is that both are desperate to have their own room. However, because there's only one window, we can't divide the room. Can you suggest any ideas to make each feel they have their own space and yet not make the bedroom look like one crazy combination of a tweenie pop princess and premiership footballer?<br><strong> Anne Wilson</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I like the idea of mixing up tweenie pop princess and football fan. Might be an interesting experiment in gender development. But I imagine you're not interested in your children being guinea pigs, and they aren't interested in each other's obsessions, either. How about using a shelving system to divide the room? Ikea has a free-standing shelf unit on casters so you can move it around. They could divide the shelves between them so it might solve some storage problems, too. It should give them a bit of privacy without cutting the room in half. Or if there isn't enough space for shelves, you could divide the room with fairy lights. <a href=\"http://www.habitat.net\">Habitat</a> has some amazing decorative lights, including one called Mayfair which doubles as a very cool room divider. Another idea is to give them each their own self-contained den. Mail order company, <a href=\"http://www.wigwamkids.co.uk\">Wigwam</a> (0870 902 7500) has some great kids beds that double as dens. Which nine-year-old girl could resist Sophie's Fair, a fairy princess pink four-poster bed with curtains that can be drawn all the way around. It's pricey at \u00a3599, but you could always improvise with a bit of DIY woodwork. For your son, there's a raised bed with a curtained-off den area underneath (\u00a3399, plus \u00a385 for curtains). Kind of breaks the bank, but it should keep them happy. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have a Victorian, scrubbed, pine-topped dining table, with heavy ornate dark 'oak' legs, 220cm by 106cm. I would like to buy four to six modern dining chairs which would provide that ultra-modern mixed with 'antique' look for my dining room. It is absolutely necessary that the chairs are comfortable as I envisage lengthy after-dinner lingering over coffee and lots of alcohol. I imagine something elegant, perhaps innovative in material and construction but within a price range that will not bring itself to the attention of my bank manager - I can go up to about \u00a3150 per chair. Are you able to suggest anything? <br><strong>Marion Lockerbie, Lancashire</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Your budget seems quite generous - you can afford something that will not only be stylish and comfortable, it will be a talking point for your dinner guests, too. The table sounds wonderful and I like the idea of mixing old and new. How about Philippe Starck's Louis Ghost Chair? It's made of see-through polycarbonate and is a typically witty, modern take on a traditional Louis XIV chair (\u00a3137 from <a href=\"http://www.purves.co.uk\">Purves &amp; Purves</a>). Or you could go for candy coloured Air chairs by <a href=\"http://www.scp.co.uk\">Jasper Morrison</a> - well within your budget at \u00a351 each and a true modern classic. Another option is the Eames DSR chair with its elegant wire work Eiffel base (slightly over budget at \u00a3155). This is eternally modern, and will look great with any table.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have just moved into a Georgian flat in Bristol and would like to decorate it in keeping with the period. Where can I go for inspiration? Can you give me any pointers? <br><strong>S Maddox</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> A great starting point would be a visit to the Geffrye Museum in east London. This is the museum of the British domestic interior, and is one of my favourite places to go for inspiration. It is set within a terrace of 18th-century almshouses (you can visit one of the restored almshouses on the first Saturday of each month) and the permanent exhibition takes the form of a series of room sets showing living rooms from 1600 to the present day. There are two Georgian rooms - early and late - showing the progression from an earlier elegant, pared-down style to a more ornate, classical style towards the end of the period. The great thing about the museum is the detail - each room has its contents listed in full, with dates, and sometimes where the object or piece of furniture came from. Then, if you want to find out more, there is a reading room with a good stock of books about British interiors, a shop with more books, and a changing exhibition featuring contemporary designers. At the moment you can see Flock'n'Roll, a survey of contemporary wallpaper. So you can get plenty of ideas for your home, both period and contemporary. The lovely garden room next to the reading room looks out to the walled gardens at the back, which are also well worth a visit. They reflect the chronology of the room sets, so you can see what a Georgian garden would have looked like, too. And, of course, there is a great cafe in the Nigel Coates designed extension, serving traditional British comfort food like bangers and mash and jam sponge and custard. <a href=\"http://www.geffrye-museum.org.uk\">Geffrye Museum</a>, Kingsland Road, London E2 (020 7739 9893).</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Is it really worth spending \u00a3600 on an office chair? I have a small home office and want a chair that will give me good support, but I don't have the budget of the Foreign Office. Can you recommend something that is ergonomic and under \u00a3200?<br><strong> Tom Pearmain, Norwich </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You are obviously referring to the Herman Miller Aeron chair. The Foreign Office recently bought 3,150 of them. I'm sure they got a good discount, but yes, the chairs do retail for around \u00a3600. You could buy a sofa for that. But the Aeron has achieved cult status. David Dimbleby uses one on Question Time. The arguably hipper Jon Snow of Channel Four News, however, sits on a classic Eames office chair. It's a Soft Pad in black leather, which will set you back a mere \u00a31,856. The Eames comes with a 30-year guarantee, but make sure you buy an authorised original made by Vitra. There's an Eames signature sewn into the upholstery at the back. Certainly puts the Aeron into perspective; I know which one I'd have if money were no object.</p> <p>But back to your question. If you are lucky, you can certainly pick up an Aeron second-hand for not too much more than your budget. Make sure you get the right size, though. If you are going to invest in such a finely tuned piece of engineering, it makes sense to get the one designed for your build and weight. Either that, or go for the top-of-the-range chair at Ikea. The Verksam swivel chair is \u00a3200 and is probably the best chair in terms of ergonomics for the money. But it doesn't look pretty and will never be offered a starring role on Newsnight. Jon Snow wouldn't even give it a second glance.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I recently stayed at the Standard Hotel in LA and really liked the way the curtains were printed with Andy Warhol images. I'd like to copy the idea in my bedroom. Is there anyone who can make customised printed curtains made to order? <br><strong>Philip</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hotel rooms can be a great source of inspiration. We all want the perfect hotel bathroom - limestone floors, Starck bath, etc, etc. Some hotels have even started to sell their bed linen and accessories (or they debit the money from your credit card if you steal them). But I'm not recommending you pack the curtains from your hotel room when you check out. Kate Osborn specialises in photo furnishings, combining art with interiors. You can give her any image and she will transform it into a print on anything from wallpaper to lampshades or blinds. For copyright reasons, she can't reproduce an Andy Warhol Marilyn, but if you supply her with a photo of your favourite icon - your mother/ girlfriend/pet/yourself - she will give it the Andy Warhol screenprint effect and create the curtains of your dreams. Prices start at \u00a380 per metre. Blinds start at \u00a3180. (020 7575 3030; <a href=\"http://www.photo-furnishings.com\">www.photo-furnishings.com</a>).</p>",
  "<p>It irritates Takako, but she has noticed that everyone in Japan seems to be talking about this book, Makeinu no Toobo (The Howl of the Loser Dog).</p> <p>It's about Japanese women who are over 30, childless and who look longingly at married mothers, wondering where it all went wrong. The new generation of liberated Japanese women. They are the makeinu. The loser dogs. The author - journalist Junko Sakai - admits she's a makeinu herself. </p> <p>Takako is 33. She works in financial services and has a nice apartment in the centre of Tokyo, but no, there are no men or children in her life, and while she's no Bridget Jones, yes, she'd like to see that change. But that doesn't make her a loser dog. The whole thing is stupid.</p> <p>Sometimes she watches the Japanese dating show Ainori. In it, three boys and three girls travel the world in a pink bus ('The love wagon') seeking romance. If one of them falls in love with another they propose on live TV. If they're rejected they're sent home; if they fall in love they return to Japan together. Takako loves it. It would be good if there was an Ainori for 30-year-olds.</p> <p>Loser dog or not, turning 30 was a big thing for Takako. For the first time she realised she had enough spare money and time to do what she wanted. She was 30, successful, but knew nothing about her own Japanese culture, so she took a course in traditional Japanese cookery - not just about the food, but about the whole ceremonial ritual. You learnt how to behave, how to kneel on the floor for hours as the meal ceremony progressed. It was excruciatingly painful, kneeling on the floor. After a while her legs didn't seem to belong to her any more. When they finally served a dish containing some exquisite delicacies, Takako couldn't even taste it for the agony. But it was good to learn for the first time how these things worked. Afterwards she signed up for a course in how to wear a kimono.</p> <p>Ironically, writer Junko Sakai says a new-found interest in ancient Japanese culture is another mark of the loser dog. So maybe there's something in it after all. Takako has reached 33 and she still doesn't really know who she is. Someone once told her that life is like a chest of drawers. You pull out one drawer and that's you. You pull out another and that's a different you. Eventually you look in enough drawers to learn who you really are. But Takako feels she is still pulling out drawer after drawer, wondering.</p> <p>Not long before Makeinu no Toobo came out her company threatened to make her redundant. It forced her to think about life. Since college she'd drifted from one job into another. She remembered how as a girl she'd had these grand ideas. She'd wanted to live in Europe for a while - she dreamt of living somewhere like Italy. </p> <p>So, if she was sacked, maybe she could start over. She could become a student again and go to Europe. When she'd gone to university after school she'd wasted her time. She'd never studied hard for her BA in law. It would be good to have a second chance to study hard.</p> <p>The redundancy never happened, but the threat of it was enough. This summer she's giving up the job and her nice apartment, putting her things in storage at her mother's house. She's coming to Britain to take a masters degree. She waits, wondering what her new life will be like. Maybe it will change her. Maybe she'll find a few more drawers she can pull out. </p> <p>The only thing that makes her anxious is not knowing whether she'll get any good TV to watch here. She'll miss Ainori.</p>",

The hero of <strong> I, Robot</strong>, a plainclothes cop (Will Smith), has a similar problem, his dislike of them based on traumatic experiences. But since he lives in Chicago in 2035, he's supposed to like robots because they're benign and useful. Then he's assigned to investigate the alleged suicide of a great cyberneticist (James Cromwell) and reaches the conclusion that there is soon to be a mass revolt of robots. Of course, no one believes him until it's almost too late. </p> <p>The film is 'suggested by' Isaac Asimov's book of the same title (principally by his Three Laws of Robotics), and its theme of machines, computers and robots going berserk, assuming malevolent personalities and taking over the world, is now commonplace and has been done much better. One thinks especially of Hal in 2001 and Yul Brynner's android gunslinger in Westworld. There are, however, some impressive special effects here, such as the several thousand new robots lined up in a warehouse like a Nuremberg rally, and there is a charming, disarming opening scene set on a busy street in Chicago where citizens happily mingle with robots working as garbage collectors, dog walkers and FedEx deliverymen. </p> <p>The most interesting character on view is Sonny, an advanced robot of considerable intelligence with the innocently inquiring mind of Star Trek 's Mr Spock. The film misses a trick when the sarcastic cop asks him whether he's ever written a great poem or painted a great picture. 'Have you?' the robot replies. What Sonny should have said is: 'I'm not Robot Browning or Robot Rauschenberg, are you?' </p> <p>Infernal Affairs is one of the best thrillers of the past couple of years. It's the story of two bright young Hong Kong lads from different sides of the tracks who cross over - one leaving his triad to become a mole in the police force, the other leaving police cadet school to become an undercover cop in the underworld. <strong> Infernal Affairs II</strong> is a sort of prequel that overlaps the first picture, beginning earlier and ending earlier, building up the 1997 hand-over of the colony to the Chinese. Mostly it focuses on Inspector Wong (Anthony Wong) and the plump gangster Sam (Eric Tsang), the dour cop and the cheerful gangster who dispatched their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s on their dangerous assignments. It turns out that they're close friends who happen to be on different sides of the eternal cat-and-mouse game, and both are excellent. </p> <p> Internal Affairs, which might well have been called 'The Wong Arm of the Law', is greatly influenced by The Godfather in its focus on crime as a family business, the coldness of its violence, the montages of its carefully synchronised executions, and even in its rather lush music. It's not, however, easy to follow, and generally less engaging than the earlier film.</p> <p> Directed by a Dutchman, John Appel, <strong> The Last Victory</strong> is an intriguing but ultimately disappointing documentary on the Palio, the ancient bareback horse race that takes place every summer in the main square of Siena. Each of the city's 10 districts competes in the event, but though they choose their jockeys, the horses are distributed by lot. </p> <p>Appel had trouble gaining access for his camera teams, which may explain the circumspection over the chicanery involved, the dangers for the participants and the violence that usually follows between passionate rival supporters. What he has done is concentrate exclusively on one district, Civetta, which is variously called a second family, a tight, proud community and a small state, and hasn't won the race since 1979. </p> <p>He talks to only a handful of people, principally a 92-year-old man obsessed with the race, a sad widow who always dressed her late son in Renaissance costume for the day, and a 21-year-old who has the great honour of being Civetta's stable boy. The race itself, which only lasts some 80 seconds, goes for almost nothing (though we do see a horse crash spectacularly into a barrier), and we get little sense of the general pageantry or the event's long history. Finally, three kids' films for these hot summer days. <strong> 13 Going on 30</strong> is yet another body-swap comedy, in which an unhappy girl in a New York suburb wishes on her thirteenth birthday to be 30, and wakes up 17 years older with breasts, a top job as an associate editor of a smart women's magazine, a reputation as a ruthless bitch and a sports-star lover. Jennifer Garner is fetching as the 30-year-old, but the timid production team, determined to get a 12A certificate, don't know where to take their story once they've put their heroine into the body of an experienced woman. </p> <p>A full-length Disney cartoon in the pre-computer manner, <strong> Home on the Range</strong> is a modest western spoof in which three cows - the tough Maggie (voiced by Roseanne Barr), the refined English Mrs Calloway (Judi Dench) and the ditsy, New Age Grace (Jennifer Tilly) - set out to save their threatened ranch, 'Patch of Heaven', by capturing the outlaw Alameda Slim (Randy Quaid). The songs are poor, but the stylised graphic work has a sort of old-world charm, and children will like it. </p> <p>More challenging fare is provided by the Danish picture <strong> Someone Like Hodder</strong>, a rather typical Scandinavian tale of life seen through the eyes of a nine-year-old lad who is lonely, grieves for his late mother, and transcends his sad life through fantasy. The locus classicus of this genre is Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's My Life as a Dog. It's an attractive, slight picture with a delightful, heart-breaking performance from Frederik Christian Johansen as the literal-minded, touchingly outspoken Hodder. Equally good is Lars Brygmann as his kindly father, a bill poster working at night. </p> <p><strong>Top five films</strong></p> <p><strong> Before Sunset</strong> (15) Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reunite, sadder and wiser after their encounter a decade earlier in Before Sunrise . </p> <p><strong> Fahrenheit 9/11</strong> (15) Michael Moore's dazzling polemic. </p> <p><strong> Anything Else</strong> (15) This Woody Allen mordant comedy is a confrontation between his older and younger selves. </p> <p><strong>Spartan</strong> (15) David Mamet takes on the political thriller. </p> <p><strong>16 Years of Alcohol</strong> (18) Kevin McKidd stars as Richard Jobson's hard-drinking, punk-rocking Edinburgh alter ego.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Spartan </strong><br>(107 mins, 15) <br>Directed by David Mamet; Starring Val Kilmer, Derek Luke, William H. Macy, Kristen Bell</p> <p>In Graham Greene's lifetime no author of comparable distinction was so involved with the movies. His natural successor is David Mamet who, in addition to having plays turned into films, writing copiously about the cinema and turning out screenplays for other film-makers, has - unlike Greene - directed nine movies himself. Six of these solo efforts have been thrillers, and the latest, Spartan, is an extremely efficient and violent exercise in the political conspiracy mode. </p> <p>An angry picture about the way men of power deceive the public and decent public servants, Spartan treats with a deadly seriousness the issues approached comically in Wag the Dog, which Mamet co-scripted. It is also an almost playful anthology of movie references and twists on familiar situations by an expert on theatrical and cinematic conventions. There are express evocations of The Lady Vanishes and Charade (two of Mamet's favourite comedy thrillers); a key quotation from The Searchers; and throughout one sequence a black-and-white Forties film noir starring Lizabeth Scott is playing on a TV in the background. (Hardly by coincidence Mamet's hero is also called Scott.) </p> <p>The film begins with what seems like a deadly pursuit through the woods involving a plucky young woman. It turns out to be a training exercise for Special Forces candidates. This inevitably recalls the opening of The Silence of the Lambs and it was Mamet who was engaged to script the film version of the sequel, Hannibal. Spartan is an odd title for a contemporary intelligence film and refers, we're told, to the way kings of Sparta would despatch a single warrior rather than an army to perform certain tasks. </p> <p>As it happens, Mamet was commissioned a few years back to write a thriller about a team of former Cold War agents offering their services on the open market and being cheated. It was called Ronin, a Japanese term for a disgraced ex-samurai for hire, and was directed by John Frankenheimer, who pioneered the conspiracy thriller in the Sixties with The Manchurian Candidate and Seven Days in May. Mamet disliked the result so much that he is credited on Ronin under the pseudonym Richard Weisz. It seems safe to assume, therefore, that Spartan is his way of correcting the failure of Ronin and taking his place alongside Frankenheimer in this fashionable genre. </p> <p>Scott (an unusually charismatic Val Kilmer) is a scarred and seasoned veteran of the Cold War and its aftermath, a leading figure in a top secret intelligence group working alongside the CIA, the FBI and the Special Forces with a licence to kill - or indeed do almost anything else in the national interest. He beats information out of suspects and kills without compunction. Like earlier Mamet heroes who earn their living as con men, Scott can slip at the drop of a cue or clue into being a cop, a psychotic crook, a middle-aged sexual predator or a businessman, and he commands total respect from his seniors and followers. Like figures in other movies of this kind (such as Clint Eastwood in Firefox) he lives a simple pastoral life between assignments. He sees himself in a line of elite bands going back to Rogers' Rangers in the eighteenth century, and considers himself a servant of the common good. 'I'm not a planner. I'm not a thinker,' he says. Oddly, he has managed to retain his respect for his Washington-based bosses over all these years, but things change when he is brought in for the biggest case he has handled - to track down the kidnappers who have abducted the President's daughter, Laura Newton, a student at Harvard. Where has she gone? Who has taken her? Was she a slut or a model student? </p> <p>From the start the picture moves with the speed of a Vegas dealer shuffling a pack of cards, the dialogue crackling like a bush fire, the atmosphere as charged as the moment before a storm. The intelligence team set up their temporary headquarters in the offices of a university American football stadium. With three days to go before the press discover the girl's absence, Scott follows leads that take him to a sleazy Boston night-club, a brothel run by a Serbian immigrant, and on to the trail of an international ring that transports American girls to the Middle East to satisfy the lusts of rich Arabs. There's some murky, racist stuff here. But the movie takes a major turn half-way through, and the search becomes a different sort of quest - and Scott comes to question everything he has stood for. </p> <p>None of this is particularly new. The Spy Who Came In From the Cold and Three Days of the Condor, among many others, reach similar conclusions about the ruthlessness of the political estab lishment. The matter was put succinctly by James Thurber back in the McCarthy Era. 'The Peacelike Mongoose' concludes: 'Ashes to ashes and clay to clay, if the enemy doesn't get you, your own folks may'. Still, it's an exciting, dark and topical movie with a plot you could use to pull corks from bottles. </p> <p>Kilmer does his best work for some time, and has the sharpest tough-guy lines while doing it. He cuts off a would-be volunteer before he can give his name, saying: 'Do I need to know? If I want camaraderie, I'll join the Masons. There's just the mission.' And to the same recruit he offers the tip: 'In the city there is always a reflection, in the woods there's always a sound.' 'What about the desert?' the acolyte inquires. 'You don't want to go to the desert,' Scott replies.</p>",

The 16 of us who are actually watching think that August telly is stupendous. For example, at what other time of the year would you find a gentle love story between a stubbly sexagenarian cabbie and an equally stubbly retired public school teacher (part of BBC2's super-spurious The Time of Your Life 'season', more of which later) rubbing up against a Panorama special about Olympic corruption over on swinging BBC1? Ratings, schmatings, eh? </p> <p>There's not much in the way of middle ground in August. Either your brain fries or it gives up and dies. Here and there may lurk 90 minutes of the hard stuff, such as the very fine <strong> Mission Accomplished: Langan in Iraq</strong>, last Thursday (BBC4. Show it again on BBC2 soon, please), in which Sean Langan not only narrowly avoided being attacked by an angry crowd of the Iraqi resistance in Samarra ('the resistance are not terrorists' explained one member, 'we are resisting the occupation of our country,' though the media usually prefers the description 'insurgents'), but also dodged fire in Fallujah while on patrol with American troops. No flak jacket for the intrepid Langan (he left it in the car) but fortunately in moments of stress he is never knowingly under Marlboro-ed: 'And here I was worrying about dying of lung cancer,' he remarked, between rounds of gunfire. </p> <p>Finally, outside the gates of Abu Ghraib, Langan listened to relatives, former inmates and one female translator who worked inside the prison describing the extreme 'sexual psychological and physical' torture they alleged took place there, several weeks before the truth of it was revealed to the world. This was riveting stuff - all the more so for being viewed with the considerable benefit of hindsight. </p> <p>In August 2004, however, even news junkies know that the only current affairs likely to appeal to the viewing public are those between Michelle and Stuart, or Nadia and her cigarettes. </p> <p>But recognising that Iraq is a tiny desert of grim-but-gripping reality subsumed by an oasis of Pina Colada Reality TV doesn't mean you have to fight it. For example, I spent a perfectly happy, guilt-free 40 minutes contemplating Shell and Nadia cleaning up their bedroom in sweet silence, live on E4 the morning after the night that Stuart was so sneakily evicted. </p> <p>Knowing that in the BB House (aka the Axis of Evil), even something as trivial as the battle against dust will probably have its own complex and cruel subtext doesn't explain why it has taken me five whole Big Brother s to work out why this is the only house in the country with a carpet sweeper instead of a vacuum cleaner. Doh. </p> <p>Watching the Big Brother kiddies at work and play made for a nice contrast to BBC2's <strong> What I Wish I'd Known When I was 20</strong>, (another Time of Your Life offering), in which a bunch of well-known, gently wrinkled (except for Joan Rivers) and occasionally lightly addled seniors reflected on youth's lack of wisdom. Of all the entertaining advice on offer (and at an hour there was about 20 minutes too much of it) from the graceful and disgraceful alike, some interesting insights were let slip: John Peel has no savings; Tony Benn has 'never taken any exercise of any kind'; Joan Bakewell doesn't believe 'that one thing leads to another' and thus wishes she had taken more drugs; George Melly believes that LSD adversely affects varicose veins; while Mary Quant says the secret to a happy marriage is 'separate bathrooms, separate cars'. And there was me thinking it was probably separate houses. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Lord Patrick Lichfield, photographer of the Pirelli calendars, thinks that his work 'like a lot of people's, won't be recognised until I'm dead'. (Though possibly, I'd hazard, not even then.) But I liked John Mortimer's tips the best: 'The secret of good health and happiness is to have rather small illnesses throughout your life which you can rely on to stop you doing anything you don't want to do', and the unarguable 'golf leads to death'. </p> <p>In <strong> Waking the Dead</strong>, however, it's business as usual: most things can, and probably will, lead to an exceptionally gory death, though the cold-case team have not yet investigated a murder by boredom. In the case of last week's unfathomably obtuse episode, Anger Management (perhaps the most barking so far in a series which habitually stamps all over the constraints of predictable stuff like, say, logic), it was Nigel Terry and his flamenco guitar. Or was it? </p> <p>The editors who work on WTD must have an absolute ball. In the first few minutes alone we saw the same dead body over and over, accompanied by the kapow of soundtracked gunshots - a handy hint for those who hadn't quite worked out the tricky forensic subtext of a dead body, a splattery sort of head wound, and a gun. But it's best not to ask too many awkward questions of WTD, just sit back and let the tsunami of random insanity wash right over you. </p> <p>Tony Grounds's <strong> When I'm Sixty-Four</strong>, on the other hand, was perfectly, soporifically paced for summer viewing, while its subject matter was wholly unexpected. Jim 'Beaky' Bryant (Alun Armstrong) was a retiring, and about to retire, from his job as a, teacher at the public school where he had been a pupil. A late developer, he had few plans for his future other than to fall in love for the first time, see as much of the world as possible, and, firstly, get a nose job. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Ray (Paul Freeman), the cabbie who drives him straight from the school to the clinic, is a widowed father of two adult children (Jason Flemyng and Tamzin Outhwaite) and is starting to feel a bit too old for the football thuggery he has enjoyed most of his life. There wasn't, frankly, much point in making Ray a wrinkly thug, other than to flag up his hetero machismo credentials, which, given that he was played by the decidedly un-fey Freeman seemed unnecessary. </p> <p>I was surprised by how surprised I was when Jim and Ray's touching friendship turned a little more, ahem, physical, and eventu ally I realised this was because I hadn't ever seen gentlemen of a certain age snogging, with their tops off and everything. </p> <p>It was sort of sweet and sort of icky (I'm not a fan of actorly kissing, period) but either way I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, which is probably down to the sheer brilliance of the performances from Armstrong and Freeman, who not only managed to make it all look quite plausible but ensured you cared enough about the characters to root for a happy ending. </p> <p>A fine supporting cast (which included the wonderful Tamsin Greig as Ray's snobby daughter-in-law), didn't get to do much other than stand around in the background tut-tutting. The part of Ray's daughter, Caz, played by Outhwaite, seemed underwritten - or perhaps it just felt that way because Outhwaite is such a star herself - while Flemyng didn't get to deliver much more than some predictable frowning and shoutiness, with a bit of light punching on the side. All in all this was an intriguing and worthwhile drama with some fine performances, but also very much an August sort of a drama, too. </p> <p>It's too early to say whether it will succeed, but <strong> The Block</strong> is intended to be ITV1's big summer I'm A Celebrity-style reality gameshow hit. Wildly successful in its native Australia, the premise is entertaining enough: four couples move into four identical half-built town houses and have to finish them off to a deadline. In September the houses will be auctioned and the one that sells for the highest sum nets the winning couple \u00a350K, while viewers can enter a competition to win one of the leftovers. </p> <p>Much has been made of the show's 'property expert', one Nicholas (brother of the more famous Simon) Cowell, but as he's barely opened his mouth we don't yet know if his brother is the most interesting thing about him. And is TV's property-show interest rate falling just as the real thing rises? If so, The Block could just as easily be a Survivor-style flop. </p> <p>Either way, The Block already suffers from the rot that currently afflicts all makeover shows on every channel - just some of the shocking soundtrack literalism includes liberal use of The Chemical Brothers' 'Block Rockin' Beats', because it has the word 'Block' in it, and the Stranglers' 'Peaches' because it includes the word 'beaches' and The Block is set in Brighton. On this basis we're probably going to be hearing Visage's 'Fade to Grey', the Rolling Stones' 'Paint It Black' and something by Pink or Ocean Colour Scene very soon, in which case it is almost certainly time for a pint of medicinal Pimm's and a fat paperback.</p>",
  "<p>Faria Alam, the woman at the heart of the spectacularly messy FA sex scandal, has sold her story to the News of the World and the Mail on Sunday for an estimated half a million quid. Meanwhile the tabloids that didn't score a piece of the action will have scoured their thesauruses for damning adjectives with which to relate the finer details of Alam's revelations in their second editions. They'll call her 'Faria the Floozy', probably. (It's always nice to resort to old-fashioned alternatives to 'slapper' at times like this. And alliteration, obviously.) Or 'Premier League Hussy.' They'll talk about FA power figures being 'In The Line of Faria'. And so on. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Sleazy Se\u00f1orita Rebecca Loos is to discuss the impact of chequebook journalism at the International Television Festival. It's her first high-profile appearance since she fetched up at the Kill Bill 2 premier in an Alice Temperley dress, with Emma Basden of Safe As Houses perched provocatively on one arm. It will, undoubtedly, reinvigorate four-month-old debates of the Who The Hell Does She Think She Is? variety. </p> <p>In the grand scheme of the nation's hate figures, kiss-and-tell girls are right up there with international forces of evil. Look at them, with their shiny hair and their rigorously saved incriminating text messages, their defiance and their carefully contrived outfits! How cynical and manipulative, greedy and (worst of all) unapologetically sexy! How dare they seduce our lovely, vulnerable national heroes, and then share the lurid details with the world in exchange for cold hard cash and 15 minutes of fame intermingled with widespread derision? </p> <p>Actually, I know how they dare. I think they should dare more. I object to this belief that women who are done wrong by celebrities (particularly of the footballing variety) should put up and shut up. There seems to be an unspoken understanding that famous men can tip the wink at any lithe young thing who takes their fancy, sleep with them, then toss them aside like last season's Dolce, safe in the knowledge that there'll be no repercussions. So when, exactly, did this vilification of the kiss-and-tell girl begin? </p> <p>Twenty years ago, the high-profile figure exposed by a kiss-and-tell story could expect to at least share the burden of public disapproval. Now, the new and absurd sanctity of celebrity means that, regardless of the circumstances, the kiss-and-tellee is widely perceived as having been so wronged by the kiss-and-teller, he is pretty much absolved of his original crime. </p> <p>The kiss-and-teller then gets a right good kicking in the press. Remember all the column inches dedicated to the bronze-limbed, hair-flicky embodiment of evil that is Rebecca Loos? Remember the bare millimetres that suggested that David Beckham was an adult, and that no one had actually held a gun to his head? </p> <p>Loos of course offended everyone by not only kissing and telling on David Beckham, prince of our hearts, but also by being smart, middle-class and eloquent when she did it, thus robbing the nation of the opportunity to write her off as a mindless piece of fluff. </p> <p>Admittedly, I have a personal stake in this. Ten years ago, I had a fling with a footballer. I was young and foolish and my motives weren't entirely pure. I was never sure where genuinely liking him (which I did) ended, and the hope that I'd assimilate some glamour and fame by association, began. None of which made it any less humiliating or painful when he ditched me, swiftly, brutally, and with no explanation, some two and a half months after he took up with me. </p> <p>I chose not to kiss and tell. Mostly because it wasn't an option. He was at the end of his career and not even remotely newsworthy. But I understand why a person might. </p> <p>Kissing and telling is a human reaction to a nasty situation. I challenge you to find me anyone who, in the wake of a cruel dumping, hasn't contemplated revenge. When a celebrity's involved, and revenge can be achieved that effortlessly, that destructively, and also be that beneficial financially - well, why wouldn't you? </p> <p>Implicit in any dissing of Alam, Loos, etcetera, is the notion that women (especially sexually active women) are predatory, scheming and evil; men, meanwhile, are just a bit weak at times. Kissing and telling is about taking back some power. It's about cash, of course, and challenging the celebrity classes, but it's essentially about non-famous or even - in the case of Sven's other illicit and outspoken lover Ulrika Jonsson - famous women grappling back some influence, refusing to go quietly, getting something out of a situation that has already taken a lot out of them. Which makes you wonder: why are we so uncomfortable with that?</p>",
  "<p>The silence was almost deafening as Japan's players celebrated here after retaining the Asian Cup. There have been more unpopular champions in football history, but not many. Apart from the one corner of the Workers Stadium where visiting supporters were accommodated, no one else in the 65,000 crowd, it seemed, was going to acknowledge a thoroughly deserved 3-1 triumph by the men in blue. </p> <p>Although China's fans were, for once, more interested in rooting for their own side than abusing Japan's for the wartime atrocities committed by their forebears, they were not prepared to join in the applause for Zico's side, who stayed in control for most of a final that was gripping but not a classic. </p> <p>With their superior technique, Japan made their possession count when they pushed forward. And no one did that better than Shunsuke Nakamura, the midfielder who plays for Reggina in Serie A - one of only two overseas-based players in the side. Nakamura made all three of Japan's goals. </p> <p>He instigated the breakthrough after 22 minutes. His free-kick was headed back at the far post by Takayuki Suzuki for Takashi Fukunishi to score with a flicked header. </p> <p>China, unbeaten in 19 matches, equalised 10 minutes later when Yan Song sent over a low cross that was side-footed home by Li Ming. China's chief striker Hao Haidong was sporting a bizarre hairnet, keeping in place a scarlet bandage that protected the bump he sustained in the semi-finals, when he suffered concussion. This restricted his play and China's attack suffered accordingly. </p> <p>Soon after Haidong's withdrawal on the hour, Japan seized the initiative. Suzuki's cross led to Keiji Tamada having a header tipped over by Liu Yunfei. Then came Japan's controversial second goal in the 64th minute. Nakamura's corner was bundled home by Koji Nakata, with the help of his hand. China protested in vain. </p> <p>Nakata was only in the team because Yasuhito Eno was suspended - the only change to Japan's starting line-up during the entire tournament. </p> <p>As China pushed forward, Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi, the Japan goalkeeper who tried, but failed, to make his name at Portsmouth a couple of years ago, made a great save, diving at substitute Li Yi's feet. The hosts were wide open at the back when Nakamura delivered the pass of the match, sending Tamada through to go round Liu Yunfei for Japan's third goal in injury time.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Would a lot of bad history have been pre-empted had a certain 25-year-old cricket reporter been sent on the Bodyline Ashes tour? A young E W Swanton could have toned down the MCC's tactics with a quiet word to captain Douglas Jardine. The great man's beliefs - Swanton's, that is - are described in Jim: The Life of EW Swanton (Aurum, \u00a320), albeit author David Rayvern Allen thinks of them as 'fantasy'. The story chimes with much else besides in this intensively archived book, including a remarkable series of letters that illustrate just why Swanton was called 'Lord Protector of English cricket'.</strong> </p> <p><strong>A missive of some 2,400 words to Lord Chobham, then president of MCC, is just one of many putting straight leading administrators, captains and managers. Whether they worked is another matter. One very tangible attempt to influence events came as late as 1996, when Kent batsman Matthew Walker was approaching 270, the Canterbury ground record held by Frank Woolley, who also happened to be Swanton's lifetime hero. Accordingly, EWS went into the Kent dressing room and urged captain Steve Marsh to declare. The captain didn't, until Walker had 275.</strong> </p> <p>Once, Viv Richards was a man of Somerset. The name of Procter was synonymous with Gloucestershire, as were Hadlee and Rice with Trent Bridge. But in today's game of musical chairs can the same be said of, say, Agarkar of Middlesex, Butler of Kent, or Blignaut of Durham? </p> <p>Short-term replacements are continually parachuted in as counties desperately keep their imported players up to the permitted two. In all, about 70 will appear this season, including what is effectively a whole Australia Test side. </p> <p>Few counties seem to see a problem (several want even less restriction) but at least the Professional Cricketers' Association recognises an 'affinity' issue, as well as a financial drain. Says the PCA's Richard Bevan: 'Most people accept that one really high-quality player, who can be switched if need be, is a good thing and will give a county tangible benefit. But in our opinion a second overseas player doesn't do that. It's got out of hand. And it is getting worse.' </p> <p><strong> Is the elbow part of the arm? One would think so, unless it has mysteriously moved. The question arises from a demonstration of a new run-out technique by Nasser Hussain during a televised match last week. Instead of standing behind the stumps and bringing the ball back to them, you stand alongside the wicket and draw the ball to it with a short backward movement.</strong> </p> <p><strong>But new questions apparently arise. 'What [Duncan] Fletcher and England are asking now,' said Hussain, 'is can you [break the stumps] with your elbow?' The former England captain also showed how he was once effected a run-out when both hands were around the ball as he broke the wicket 'and the ball never actually hit the stumps.'</strong> </p> <p><strong>Umpiring authorities are mystified. They point out that such an action was not only acceptable but routine, and that the use of the elbow is likewise legal: the law clearly allows the wicket to be broken with the fielder's 'hand or arm, providing the ball is in the hand or hands so used'.</strong> </p> <p>Newspaper reports from The Oval these days tend to offer the sort of precise observation you get from Test match reports: assessment of how much a ball moved in the air and from the pitch, and the correctness of a leg-before decision. That's because journalists see replays from Surrey's own video camera. While most counties use video for player analysis, the club make it immediately available to the press and also offer the day's highlights on their website, calling the output 'Surrey TV'. They see a great potential for video streaming from all grounds, enabling a coach in his office at, say, Taunton, to watch his side in action at Headingley, as well as giving fans the opportunity to follow any game online. </p> <p>A big and initially costly operation, it would need, says a Surrey spokesman, a major sponsor and probably a TV company in harness. But most of all it needs the England and Wales Cricket Board to show an interest. </p> <p>norman.harris@observer.co.uk</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>There are times, admittedly infrequent, when you want to believe everything a politician says. </p> <p>Such a moment arrived last week when, out of the mouth of the president of the United Nations General Assembly, Julian R Hunte, popped the following: 'While conflicts in the world will not cease overnight, if we could have peace for 16 days, then maybe, just maybe, we could have it forever.' </p> <p>Resisting the temptation to ridicule a man who parts his name with an initial as irretrievably pompous, we could do worse than embrace Mr Hunte's grandiose sentiment on the eve of what many think will be the most dangerous Olympics since Hitler's in 1936. </p> <p>Sport won't stop the bombers bombing or the haters hating, but it might light up our lives for a couple of weeks of harmless enjoyment. It might persuade even a few of the twisted killers that there are times when we can come together. It is not exactly a summit of major intellects, nor does the Olympic movement always live up to its haughty ideals (there is an ongoing row over the endorsement of some slave-wages sports-goods manufacturers at the Games), but there is much to celebrate in human excellence. And even failure, which reminds us of our shared and universal frailties. </p> <p>So Mr Hunte, along with the president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, is entitled to call for a truce. Rogge is an impressive man who probably realises a few years into taking over from the aloof Juan Antonio Samaranch that running the IOC is like being in charge of a doubly incontinent octopus. His is a brief you would not wish on the man who stole your best girl. Yet he has held the wriggling monster in check, chivvying along what at one point looked like a hopelessly slack Athens organising committee. </p> <p>On Friday, Rogge was probably relieved as much as happy to declare: 'We knew that the promises of the organising committee and also the government would be fulfilled, and I'm very glad to see that this is the case and that we are heading towards a very, very successful Games.' </p> <p>Perhaps. These Olympics might yet be dressed up in that tired accolade 'the best ever' - which would disappoint the terminally cynical commentators who have been knocking the organisers for the past couple of years - but, given that half the tickets remain unsold with a week to go, it is not unreasonable to assume that the XXVIIIth Olympiad is struggling to capture the world's imagination. </p> <p>People do have concerns about security, concerns not eased even by the record expenditure of \u00a31billion to safeguard the 10,000-plus athletes, another 10,000 working for the media, thousands more support staff and volunteers, hundreds of thousands of spectators and, not least, the citizens of Athens. </p> <p>There will be more paranoia in the Greek capital and the immediate environs than in a Football Association council meeting. And there will be an excess of zeal, no doubt, as the truncheoned-up militia bring their authority to bear on visitors and locals alike. Patience will be stretched to breaking point in temperatures hovering around the century mark. </p> <p>Already, some athletes, mainly rich American ones, have decided that the sort of courage they have brought to their athletic regime does not necessarily translate to the sort you need to make yourself a potential target for a madman strapped to a bomb. Fair enough. It is an individual decision. It's just one that exposes their replacements to the danger they shy away from, which is something they might like to think about in the event of a calamity. </p> <p>But that is to dwell too long and grimly on events that, in all probability, will remain the fantasies of the fanatics. The Athens Olympics are ready to rumble. </p> <p>As for Britain, the team leaves with the usual mixed emotions, a group of dedicated athletes who would like more support than ever comes their way. You get the impression occasionally - before any major tournament - that some writers rather like the fact that British competitors will go forth and, well, come fourth. </p> <p>It is an odd and obviously untreatable illness, most recently evident in Portugal. The subsequent fall-out at Soho Square - where sex between consenting adults induced an outbreak of slavering, bug-eyed indignation among the opinion-formers - peeled back the thin veil of objectivity they pretend to bring to their work. They wanted Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson to fail at Euro 2004 to prove what prescient wizards they were. To then beat him with a moral stick should shame them for ever. </p> <p>Similarly, our sprinters, who have reasonable if slim hopes of medals, travel to Athens buoyed only by their own conviction. As far as the experts are concerned, it is the unbeatable American and Caribbean sprinters who will be on the podium. Possibly so. But you don't have to be a one-eyed patriot to believe that Mark Lewis-Francis, Jason Gardener and Darren Campbell will give them at least something to think about. </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum of expectation is the bobbing head of Paula Radcliffe. She is favourite for the women's marathon and has been in fantastic form over 5,000 and 10,000 metres recently. If she can carry the weight of a nation's hopes over that famous marathon course her reputation will surely be secure from even the most devious and cynical inquisitor. </p> <p>The athletes, of course, will just get on with it. This is their moment, one they have slaved for. To echo Mr Hunte - and Mr Bowie - they could be heroes just for one day. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Premier League clubs are seeking greater control over the FA Cup and England team as part of a major overhaul of the Football Association, following the failed attempt to oust Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. </p> <p>Influential figures are using the FA's inquest into the 'Svengate' crisis to argue that the restructuring now being planned should reduce amateur football's influence in decision-making and increase the professional game's power over the FA's money-making 'crown jewels'. </p> <p>Another FA board meeting on Tuesday will start a reorganisation process that may lead to the creation of a new body - dominated by the Premier League and Football League - to handle all commercial matters, such as the FA's television and marketing deals. </p> <p>The governing body is also seriously considering putting independent figures from outside the FA on to its board in an attempt to avert a repeat of the recent chaos. Ministers, MPs and the Independent Football Commission are urging the FA to bring in outsiders, as big companies do, as independent scrutineers. </p> <p>'On Tuesday the FA board will start drawing up a road map towards a more effective FA, and there's clearly a need to change some of the structures and processes to achieve that, not least in the area of our corporate governance,' said one FA insider. 'One proposal is for the running of the FA Cup and England team to be devolved to a new body.' </p> <p>FA board members Dave Richards, the Premier League chairman, and Rupert Lowe, the Southampton chairman, are among those who believe the soul-searching going on at Soho Square is the ideal opportunity for a major rethink. Richards is leading calls for representatives of top-flight clubs to be given a much bigger say in the FA's most high-profile areas. </p> <p>Sources close to Richards, whose allies include Bolton Wanderers chairman and fellow FA board member, Phil Gartside, say he wants the amateur game's representatives - who currently enjoy equal voting rights to the chairmen of the Premiership and Football League clubs - to concentrate on matters such as coaching and grassroots development. </p> <p>'Dave believes the professional game should have a greater say over the FA Cup, England team and all FA contracts, as these are the things that directly affect clubs, whose players provide 95 per cent of the FA's income by playing for England and participating in the FA Cup,' said one associate. </p> <p>However, some senior FA staff fear the moves will mean the end of the world's oldest football association as a credible governing body that is independent of the game's vested interests. They are worried that big clubs could use their new-found power to take more of the FA's \u00a396 million annual income and divert funds from the amateur game. </p> <p>Tuesday's board meeting will discuss two things: the nature and extent of the 'immediate review' of the FA's operations announced last week and the hunt for a new chief executive to replace Mark Palios. He resigned after communications executive Colin Gibson was caught offering to trade details of Eriksson's affair with FA secretary Faria Alam in return for the News of the World not disclosing that Palios had also slept with her. </p> <p>FA sources indicated last night that David Davies, its executive director, was in serious danger of losing his job. He angered colleagues by giving Eriksson a public vote of confidence last week when the Swede's conduct was still being investigated by FA lawyers. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>'Dave Richards?' mused a senior figure at one of the Premiership's leading clubs. 'You mean the man who runs football!' The quip was delivered with a laugh, but contained more truth than almost any statement to emerge from the FA over the past three weeks of the superficially soap operatic, but actually deeply significant, 'Svengate' saga. </p> <p>Richards may be little known to many other than fans of Sheffield Wednesday, but he is probably now the most powerful man in English football. His power flows less from the roles he occupies - chairman of the Premier League and a key member of the FA's ruling 12-man board - and more from the Yorkshireman's status as the game's Mr Fixit in times of upheaval. While the names of FA chairman Geoff Thompson and executive director David Davies are more familiar, it is Richards who quietly and discreetly is the driving force in the restructuring of the FA that will now follow the governing body's self-induced crisis. </p> <p>His views on the game provide useful pointers to the process of reform that they will undertake in earnest when, on Tuesday, they hold their second board meeting inside five days. However, it is Richards' beliefs that the Premier League clubs should have more control over key FA activities, such as the FA Cup and the England team, that lead some at Soho Square to view him as the arch-conspirator in a plot to reduce the FA to an impotent irrelevance. They fear that the Premier League intend to use the FA's plight to extend their already considerable influence over the FA in the guise of what Southampton chairman and FA board member Rupert Lowe yesterday described as an overdue 'sensible reorganisation'.</p> <p> Richards is one of the professional game's six representatives on the FA board. One close colleague said: 'He's decisive, shows strong leadership, is very popular with the 20 Premier League chairmen because he's good at his job and he's also quite a reformer. When the shit hits the fan, everyone turns to him to sort things out.' Another said: 'He's a seasoned political operator in football, a principal player, one of the game's deal-makers and one of the key figures people turn to at a time when you need some key figures involved, like now.' </p> <p>Those attributes largely explain why last Thursday, when the FA cleared Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson of any provable wrongdoing over the Faria Alam scandal, they also gave Richards and Roger Burden, another FA board member but who represents football's grass roots, new roles 'supporting' the indecisive, discredited Thompson. In effect, they made them joint FA chairmen or chief executives. </p> <p>In the difficult weeks ahead for the FA, Richards will play a crucial role. Some people at FA headquarters fear that could be bad news. It is still reeling from the chaos, shame and confusion surrounding Svengate. The England head coach's affair with Alam, Davies's personal assistant, was ill-advised. But FA chief executive Mark Palios and his spin-doctor Colin Gibson's failed attempt to protect Palios by betraying Eriksson to the News of the World - Palios had slept with Alam, too - turned a bit of tabloid farce into both a scandal and a crisis. Last Sunday evening Palios, who had repeatedly told his staff they had to be 'credible' in everything they did, jumped before he was pushed. Gibson, until then an effective and professional FA linkman with the media, has also gone. Those inside the FA who believe it should be a powerful, respected, well-resourced and independent body now fear the worst. 'The FA has made such colossal mistakes and become such a laughing stock over the last few weeks that I doubt that it can ever recover,' said one concerned official. He is worried that the power vacuum at the top of the organisation means there is no longer anyone left who can defend it from the football equivalent of land-grab. </p> <p>So what does Richards think should happen next? 'He thinks that the FA decision-making process is very dysfunctional and needs changing, that the FA board is too big and unwieldy, that there needs to be a change in leadership, and that there should be a strategic review of the FA's role,' explained one associate. Richards is thought to favour scrapping the FA Council, the 90-strong body that reflects the FA's origins in the amateur game; reducing the FA board to only a few members to act as an executive board; restricting the power of the amateur game's representatives to matters such as developing the game's grass roots; and giving professional football control of the FA's two big earners, the England team and the FA Cup. </p> <p>'His [Richards'] view is that the professional clubs provide 95 per cent of the FA's income through its players appearing in the FA Cup or representing the national side and, therefore, the professional side of the game should have a greater say in the running of the FA Cup, England team and all sponsorship, broadcasting and commercial contracts - anything that affects the professional game and the way it is run,' the associate added. 'He doesn't think the professional game should take all the cash and cut the amateur game adrift. In fact, he wants the existing 50-50 split of FA income between the two to be maintained, but he does think the amateur game should stick to things that affect them.' </p> <p>One proposal already being floated is for a new body involving the Premier League and Football League to run the FA Cup and the England team, which bring in most of the FA's \u00a396million annual income. Richards is closely associated with prominent people in football who want the bigger clubs to have more power, such as Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis, his Bolton Wanderers counterpart Phil Gartside, Blackburn chairman Robert Coar, former Liverpool chairman Noel White and Ken Bates, until recently the Chelsea chairman. It may be coincidence, but this group includes men who either resent Eriksson being paid \u00a34m a year or who simply think he is not up to the job. Some of them, notably Bates, are among those who in recent years have sought to reduce the number of England friendlies, see clubs paid for lending their players to the national side and increase the money given to the FA Cup winners - all moves that would help Premiership clubs but not the FA or England. </p> <p>One of Richards' oldest and closest contacts in football is Gibson, the former Daily Mail sports editor, who only last January swapped Fleet Street for a \u00a3150,000 post as FA head of communications, an organisation his sports section had attacked with gusto for months. This, remember, was the sports section that, under Gibson's direction, had played a crucial role in forcing out Adam Crozier as FA chief executive in October 2002. Gibson was lured to Soho Square by Palios, whose cause was championed by Richards and, coincidentally, the Daily Mail sports pages. </p> <p>Richards has not revealed how he feels about two people whom he strongly supported, and whom he had hoped would improve the FA, conspiring to sell out the England boss. Richards and his closest allies have been instrumental in getting more power inside the FA for the big clubs than ever before - and arguably more than is healthy for a supposedly independent governing body. The creation of the Professional Game Board, an issue that contributed to Crozier's departure, gives them a big say. But for Richards and his friends, that is not enough. 'He is not happy about the fact that the PGB's decisions still have to be ratified by the FA main board and council, both of which are dominated by amateurs,' said an ally. That will almost certainly change. 'If people who don't want the FA to prosper as a meaningful force get control, then the FA as we have always known it could easily disappear,' said one insider. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>If it was a faltering first step for Rangers in their pursuit of the Premier League championship, it was something of a leap for Aberdeen, the Pittodrie side achieving an improbable, and very acceptable, result through nothing fancier than diligence, application and defensive concentration. </p> <p>In this regard, nobody was more effective than Zander Diamond, the young Pittodrie defender whose attention to his duties was unrelenting, especially during a second half in which he was by far the most formidable obstacle between the Ibrox side and victory. </p> <p>On the opening day there is a tendency among players to allow the heart to pull rank on the mind, resulting in an almost hysterical physical commitment to the cause at an unsustainable pace. At these times, assessments of prospects for the new season become fudged as controlled, coordinated and coherent football is surrendered to industriousness. </p> <p>Given the urgent search for signs of progress in these teams by their respective supporters - as well as among professional observers - it was hardly surprising that the players, for most of the match, should succumb to the general air of endeavour rather than deliberation. </p> <p>To Jimmy Calderwood, the newly appointed manager of Aberdeen, it was especially important that the home fans should not be allowed to leave the stadium in the belief that their side had not offered total application. There has been a drowsiness about Pittodrie for a number of years, one the lively and garrulous Calderwood seems well equipped to terminate. </p> <p>That two of his players, Kevin McNaughton and Diamond, should be cautioned before the game was one-third completed for powerful challenges on Peter Lovenkrands would be a source of some satisfaction to the manager, even if the players concerned had, so early, exposed themselves to the risk of a red card. </p> <p>Amid the untidiness that was the most notable impression before the interval, there was the odd moment of excitement around the home goal, thanks largely to the one exception to the overall dishevelment, Chris Burke. </p> <p>A naturally skilled wide player, Burke consistently attempted to overcome Philip McGuire on the left of the Aberdeen defence with cleverness and adroit manipulation of the ball and, on those occasions when he created the space to deliver menacing crosses, he brought some alarm to the home defenders. </p> <p>But Dado Prso headed weakly straight at David Preece from one of Burke's accurate corners, while the goalkeeper distinguished himself with a quick dive to cut out Burke's low centre towards the unmarked Prso, after Nacho Novo's precise cross-field pass from the left. </p> <p>In the circumstances, it was a serious loss when Burke was forced to leave the field only one minute into the second half. He appeared more groggy than injured when he suddenly fell to the turf, quite independent of any incident, and it was later reported that he had felt faint because of dehydration. </p> <p>His replacement, Shota Arveladze, took Novo's place in attack beside Prso, with the little Spaniard moving to Burke's beat on the right, but there was little change in the established, that is rather pedestrian and messy, pattern to the match. </p> <p>Even so, Rangers had opportunities to take the lead, but were frustrated by the emergence of Diamond as a towering influence at the heart of the Aberdeen defence. Even if Prso was a little dilatory in trying to control Novo's low centre following a penetrative run on the right, Diamond was quick and alert in blocking the Croatia striker's close-range drive. </p> <p>He was also there to crowd out Prso as the latter received another cross from Novo and yet again to get in the way of Novo's shot after making ground as the speedy little Rangers forward burst into the penalty area on the right. </p> <p>Aberdeen had far fewer opportunities, although Derek Adams might have achieved more than a feeble header at Stefan Klos in the Rangers goal after Russell Anderson had headed a free-kick from Diamond across to the striker. </p> <p>Even Diamond could not have denied Lovenkrands, however, when he ran to meet a perfect cross from Gregory Vignal from the left, but the Dane, without a challenge and just six yards out, sent the header against the crossbar. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In 1984, Carl Lewis won the 100metres, the first of his four gold medals at the Los Angeles Olympics, in 9.99sec. He was the first man to break the 10-second barrier in an Olympic final since Jim Hines 16 years earlier in Mexico City, when many times were improved by the advantage of performing at altitude. Lewis was upholding the Olympic creed of citius, altius, fortius - faster, higher, stronger. </p> <p>Since then, the Olympic 100m champion has always run faster than 10sec to win gold. But, with the short sprint at last year's world championships in Paris being won in 10.07sec by Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis - the first plus-10sec winning run at a major championships since Lewis became the inaugural world champion in Helsinki in 1983 - that might change this year. It is conceivable that, at just after 10pm on 21 August, the 100m Olympic gold will be won, for the first time since Scotland's Allan Wells in Moscow in 1980, in a time that fails to break 10 seconds. </p> <p>A glance at the world's best performances this year in other 'explosive' events in track and field - those that require the most power - shows that many medals could be won by performances inferior to those of the past five Olympics. Never mind faster, higher, stronger, Athens is likely to host the slower, lower, weaker Games. </p> <p>Why? 'Because everyone's scared of getting caught and so has stopped taking drugs,' says Jason Gardener, who hopes to be running for Britain in this year's 100m final. 'That's very encouraging because if I can get back to my personal best [9.98] then I have a chance.' </p> <p>Gardener knows it as not as simple as a reduction in drug-taking - 'There are other variables, such as conditions with the wind' - but points out: 'It was all kicking off around the time of the world championships and suddenly for the first time in a long time the world 100-metre champs weren't won in under 10.' </p> <p>By 'all kicking off' he means a syringe containing the banned steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) had been sent anonymously to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) in June 2003, two months before the Paris championships. Usada later identified a California laboratory, the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (Balco) in San Francisco, as the source of THG. This resulted in several high-profile casualties, including Britain's Dwain Chambers, who tested positive for the substance at a training camp last August and was subsequently banned. Gardener believes this scared many athletes who had been using drugs and is a reason why performances have been down ahead of Athens. </p> <p>'Of course that's why,' Gardener says. 'Drugs increase power, strength, muscle. And you recover quicker so you can do more training, so it all affects your performance.' </p> <p>Heather Ross, an international hurdler for Britain in the 1970s and 1980s, is saddened by the level of drug taking in her sport, which cost her any chance of a medal, but believes fewer athletes will take the risk in Athens. </p> <p>'I contribute to the anti-doping forum on the IAAF [International Association of Athletics Federations] website and I would say around 90 per cent of people believe there is a limit to how faster, higher or stronger you can go without doping. If you take away that help then the standards have to drop and they have been doing since, I would say, the fall of the Eastern bloc countries when it was part of their infrastructure. </p> <p>'Since then [the late 1980s] the problem has, unfortunately, spread out all over the world. Doping has always been big in America. Dr Wade Exum [the former chief medical officer of the US athletics team in the 1990s] had loads of stories about athletes taking drugs, including people like Carl Lewis. So even then, Americans were allowed to get away with murder. Really the breakthrough came with Balco. That was the turning point when the whole thing started to crumble.' </p> <p>Dick Pound, head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), who have been instrumental in cleaning up athletics, agrees that last year's flurry of positive tests following Balco has persuaded athletes to stop taking drugs and that many purposely underachieved to avoid competing in Athens, where they would have been shown up as cheats. </p> <p>'Athletes have underperformed. We saw the results in the US trials. There's going to be a lot more culling of suspect athletes before Athens,' Pound says. 'The testing is getting better and extending to substances that may not have always been detectable, such as the human growth hormone [HGH]. This is making potential cheaters nervous.' </p> <p>Pound agrees that this year's 100m champion may well run markedly slower than in the past four Games and that performances could be down in many track and field events. His view is supported by Michael Johnson, the world record holder at 200m and 400m, who says: 'This is a bad period for the sport. We are in a lull. No one is doing anything very remarkable. The \"wow\" factor is missing.' </p> <p>This does not worry Pound. 'The thrill at the Games is the competition. One of the events I remember from the Sydney Olympics is the 10,000metres, which was such an exciting finish. [Haile Gebrselassie beat Paul Tergat on the line.] People are interested in the winner and only maybe then the time.' </p> <p>And if performances in Athens prove to be the inverse of the Olympic motto? 'The thing about doping is you get results you would not have expected for another 20 or 30 years. But they will be matched in the end.' </p> <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 revealed the full extent of doping in the Eastern bloc. The reigning Olympic long jump champion, Heike Dreschler, said of the former East German regime: 'When you went to the doctor and he said, \"Take these, they are vitamins and they are good for you\", you believed him. I did not question anything.' </p> <p>Others felt the effects more severely than Dreschler. The 1986 women's shot put European champion, Heidi Krieger, undertook an operation to become a man after the anabolic steroids prescribed to her over several years in the 1980s (under the East German government's clandestine State Plan 14.25) caused her to develop facial hair, an Adam's apple and severe psychological problems. Krieger, who changed name to Andreas, was just one of the estimated 6,000 to 10,000 former East German athletes who were doped in the 1970s and 1980s. </p> <p>Eastern European countries were not the only ones where doping was prevalent. In 1988, the Canadian Ben Johnson tested positive for an anabolic steroid following his 9.79sec winning run in the 100m at the Seoul Olympics and the American Florence Griffith Joyner, 100m and 200m champion at the same Games, died of a heart attack 10 years later from complications that were thought to be related to performance-enhancing substances. She was 38. </p> <p>Although THG can now be detected, human growth hormone has been used since the late 1980s and it is not, as yet, tested for. Will this change in Athens? 'We're being a little cutesy on that,' says Pound. 'You can certainly test for it, but there's always been the concern that a test does not produce false positives.' </p> <p>Beyond HGH, genetic engineering could be the next short cut employed by athletes who, desperate to improve performance, will always embrace the next scientific advances. So, health permitting, why not allow athletes to be artificially propelled and at least apply some level of control? </p> <p>'Well, first of all, performance enhancers do affect health and what of the future? Who would want their children to take part in a sport that could result in a heart attack at 45 because, for example, of enlarged organs from human growth hormones,' says Ross. </p> <p>'I find genetic engineering terrifying. It sounds like Nazi Germany. It is one possible avenue and the problem with all of this is the scientists, who have a financial incentive to develop drugs for athletes, will always be one step ahead.' </p> <p>Maybe that is the reality. A former British sprinter recently offered The Observer this view: 'Do spectators and TV viewers want to see normal people running? Do they really want to see the Olympic 100metres gold won in 10.2 seconds? No. They want to see monsters fuelled by steroids making super-human performances and winning races in 9.75. That's the reality.' It is not a view shared by all. </p> <p>Many in athletics feel the majority of world records were set by 'super-human' athletes, which could mean the best marks may never be beaten. Plenty of world records from the 1980s still stand. 'In my event, the 100 metres hurdles, people have got close to the world record [12.21, set in 1988 by Bulgaria's Yordonka Donkova] but never beaten it,' says Ross, 'and I doubt if anyone ever will.' </p> <p>As the peak of an athlete's four-year cycle, the Olympics are often the scene of great performances. When the Games begin later this week, this may not be the case, at least in comparison to earlier times and distances. </p> <p>'I don't think if there are lesser performances in Athens it will matter, as the Olympics are a different context,' says Ross. 'The main thing is to participate. And the Olympics are bigger than world records. It's the whole international thing of people coming together, the opening and closing ceremony - that's a very special thing. The time may have come when existing world records can't be beaten.' </p> <p>Peter Radford, 100m bronze medallist at the 1960 Olympics and a former head of UK Athletics, believes that doping problems are directly related to the sport's emphasis on world records. </p> <p>'If we realise what happened in Eastern Europe before the wall came down and, also, what happened and has been happening in the United States, then many of the world records we hold or held in such regard don't have the meaning we think they should. </p> <p>'World records are problematic because the sport took itself into a dead end when it started idolising them. For an athletics grand prix to attract crowds it has to advertise that a record may go. Can you imagine any other sport attempting to draw an audience by saying one of the greatest performances ever will be seen today? Athletics should be about the competition, the race. Look at horse racing, where it is all about horses and jockeys going head to head, not about times. </p> <p>'In Athens the winner of the 100, for example, may win in 10.05 but it is the race that matters and the rest of the sport should take its lead from the Olympics.' </p> <p>Radford points to Sir Roger Bannister's sub-four-minute-mile run in 1954 as a pivotal point. 'That was one of the biggest disasters for athletics. No one talks about it now, but afterwards everyone held their breath to see if the IAAF would ratify it because it wasn't a bona fide race. Only one person who started had any intention of winning. If it hadn't been ratified, we would not have had two generations of meaningless charging after records. </p> <p>'Sure it is a part of human interest to know who is the fastest, just as we want to know how quick Andrew Flintoff's delivery was or the velocity of David Beckham's penalty, but that isn't the point. It may seem an odd example, but if you had weight classes, like in boxing, then you wouldn't have these ridiculous, bulked up athletes.' </p> <p>Over the following three weeks, the world might be watching slower, lower weaker performances. And athletics will be all the better for that. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "Government help with emergency childcare for working mothers might benefit big business (News, last week) but only at the expense of parents, who will feel pressured by this 'service' to give work more priority over their children than feels comfortable. It will also be at the expense of children, for whom quality care starts with familiarity. <p>The ideal emergency care-giver is one or other parent, perhaps drawing on parental leave as in Sweden, or a relative or friend.

  "<p>One newspaper revealed she wants a boob job. Another said she now wants to return to Portugal to find a man. A third reported that she once tried to seduce an actor from EastEnders. The new darling of the tabloids yesterday was just that - accepted as a darling, even though she was born a man. </p> <p>Nadia Almada had just won Big Brother, the blue riband event of reality television, and claimed the \u00a363,500 prize. By the final's climax last week an astounding 3,863,696 people had voted for her, more than double the number polled by runner-up Jason. Unlike Nadia's housemates, viewers knew she was a transsexual woman. Their participation constituted one of the most comprehensive social surveys ever to address the question: how tolerant is Britain today? </p> <p>Eight million were gripped as the gameshow, already lauded and derided in equal measure as a cultural weather vane, concocted a social experiment unimaginable only a few years ago. By keeping her sex change hidden from the housemates, Nadia set out to be accepted by them on her own terms: as a woman. On live television, the nation watched this difficult, painful, awesome quest for self-identity flower and be fulfilled. When it comes to 'USPs' - unique selling points - Nadia's transsexuality and TV stardom make her one of the most extraordinary human beings alive. </p> <p>It was small wonder the 50-1 outsider with the squawking voice and grating laugh - whose antics included spanking bare bottoms and licking jam off fellow contestants' cleavages - was almost hysterical after her victory on Friday night. Emerging from the Big Brother house to fireworks and riotous cheers, the Portuguese-born bank clerk was asked by presenter Davina McCall why she had kept her transsexuality hidden from her housemates. 'It wasn't a secret,' she said. 'It was more a reassurance of myself, it was my self-ambition to achieve. It was very hard because there were times that I felt I had to lie a little bit and I didn't want to lie at all.' </p> <p>There was no doubting the impact Nadia - dubbed the chainsmoking 'Portugeezer' - had on the public psyche, as the overwhelming majority gathered outside the Elstree studios were waving signs bearing her name, including one that said: 'Nadia - she is all woman.' A group of girls had copied her dress sense and were kitted out in short skirts, high heels and thick, curly, black wigs. </p> <p>Dave Roberts, 38, a PC engineer from Ashford in Middlesex, wore a t-shirt with a picture of Nadia under the words 'Oh my God, ha ha ha ha ha.' He admitted: 'I never thought I would be here wearing a t-shirt with a picture of a transsexual on it. I didn't support her initially and I was quite prejudiced. I thought it was all a bit weird but she has changed my mind. I think it's made people more accepting in general because we have just seen her for the person she is. She was just a great laugh.' </p> <p>Mary Emma Cawtheray, 29, a transsexual woman formerly called Stephen, from Watford, said: 'She symbolises everything I wanted to be. She's changed things for transsexuals. It is a really difficult thing for people to deal with but she's managed to heighten awareness. I never thought she'd win but what she has done has helped lots of the public to understand. The fact that her big secret was a big issue for her but it wasn't for anyone else shows she has been accepted.' </p> <p>To her supporters there was no question that Nadia was all woman: 'She is a lady with a capital L,' shrieked Cheryl Farnham, a 19-year-old secretary who had made the trip from Guernsey. Also in the crowd was the winner's mother, Conceicao, who gave birth to her on the island of Madeira 27 years ago. Nadia was then Jorge, the eldest of six brothers. With his mother and father, Jose Luis, Jorge spent some of his childhood in South Africa, but Conceicao and the boys flew back to Madeira in 1993 and lost all contact with Jose, who despite the estrangement told a newspaper last week: 'Me and my wife always wanted a daughter. We gave up trying for a girl after six children and now, after all this time, God has given me the daughter I always prayed for.' </p> <p>At home in the mountain village of Campanario, Jorge helped to cook for and dress his younger brothers when his mother went out to work in a local hotel. He got a job as a waiter at the same hotel but was mocked by his peers for lacking masculinity and, when he was 19, left for Britain. By now he was convinced he was a woman in a man's body and he began the arduous process of transition while working in Woking in a department store, supermarket and bank. He had breast implants a year ago and finally completed the switch with a painful operation six months before entering the house. 'Even though I was in so much pain when I woke up, it was the best day of my life,' she admitted in the Big Brother diary room. </p> <p>The Channel 4 series was a vital step in Nadia's mental adjustment, according to Dr Ceri Parsons, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby. 'It must have been quite emotional for her but she managed to achieve real-life testing, putting herself in a situation where people didn't know her history,' she said. 'The housemates completely accepted Nadia the woman. Transition is an incredible journey for a lot of people who want to blend in and be unremarkable. To have put herself out there so publicly makes her very remarkable indeed.' Unlike Sky One's notorious reality dating show There's Something About Miriam... in which six men vied for the attentions of a glamorous woman without realising she was once a man, Nadia's victory appears to have broken new boundaries in television and society. Peter Bazalgette, chairman of Endemol UK and the man responsible for bringing Big Brother to this country, said: 'Her participation proved to be of the most unusual, original nature of anyone who has ever been in the house. </p> <p>'She didn't mind the country learning about her past because to her it became an experiment to see if she would be accepted by housemates who didn't know her background. It dawned on viewers when she was in the diary room that she was trying to prove herself as a woman. It was a riveting human drama. </p> <p>'At the same time she's become the nation's darling. It was good to have Latin temperament in the house instead of all those very sober north Europeans. People didn't vote for her because she's a transsexual but because they liked her. They were blind to her past. That's the point of tolerance - it's not patronising.' </p> <p>Bazalgette hit back at 'intolerant' critics who have condemned Big Brother as a freak show. 'Why do they have to describe a transsexual person as a gimmick or a freak? I'm not going to pretend we aren't in the entertainment business - we're not the Church of England on the march - but we put Nadia in because she's interesting. People in their 60s and 70s may have learned nothing but younger people have.' </p> <p>He received backing from Claire McNab, 41, a transsexual woman originally from Dublin. 'The first transsexual person to get sustained exposure in the media was the character Hayley in Coronation Street,' she said. 'That was incredibly beneficial because people could see the difficulties she went through and get over the stereotypes. </p> <p>'But Nadia is a real person. I was initially sceptical about whether she would be helpful because of the attention and the tabloids getting down her neck. But I'm pleased to say I was wrong and people have seen a real transperson in real life. She's a normal person with all the flaws - like her craving for cigarettes all the time - that human beings have.' </p> <p>McNab, vice-president of the pressure group Press For Change, representing the 5,000 transsexual people in the UK, added: 'Transsexual people are about one in 10,000 of the population so most folks don't knowingly encounter a transsexual person, whereas most do know someone who is gay or lesbian. Big Brother was an unusual chance for people to see beyond the stereotypes. These things are slow to change, however, and society has taken a long time to come to terms with people who are hidden. Media representations like this are part of the process. It's not going to change overnight but it's a step in the right direction. Eventually you hope the new attitude will percolate through. </p> <p>'We've made huge steps but there is still a long way to go before we take a full place in society. When people transition they tumble several rungs down the socioeconomic scale. There is still a tendency to see us as people to poke fun at in a way they wouldn't with gay or lesbian people. The saddest thing is that the greatest negativity comes from inside the Christian churches. The good that's done by Big Brother is offset by the damage done by the bishops stirring up hatred against us.' </p> <p>The number of transsexuals having surgery in Britain each year has risen from eight in 1959 to 30 in 1979, 80 in 1989 and now around 300 per year. The Gender Recognition Act, which gained royal assent last month, will allow them to gain the legal status of their acquired gender, change their birth certificates and marry. </p> <p>Dr Lynne Jones MP, chair of the parliamentary forum on transsexualism, said: 'The Big Brother result indicates people haven't got the kind of prejudices that would in the past have prevented them voting for a transsexual housemate. They're just voting for her as a woman in her own right. The fact of her being transsexual is not important.' </p> <p>Among her fans outside the Big Brother house on Friday night was Paul Robinson, 33, a call centre team leader from Luton. 'Because of Nadia I came out to my granddad and told him I was gay,' he said.'My family were scared for me to tell him but in the end he did not bat an eyelid. Nadia helped me do that.'</p>",
  "<p>James Murdoch, chief executive of satellite broadcaster BSkyB, is in the City doghouse after investors reacted with horror to his plans to spend \u00a3450 million on modernising the business and boosting marketing in the face of increasing competition. </p> <p>To anyone of a sound and rational disposition, it may seem odd to lop \u00a32 billion off BSkyB's share price because the company is investing to expand its operations and increase subscribers at a time when rivals such as ITV and the cable television companies are sharpening up their acts. Surely, it's the obvious thing to do? </p> <p>But the City hates surprises, especially when the action Murdoch unveiled may hold back profits growth for several years. The whole concept of short-term pain for long-term gain simply doesn't wash in the minds of some shareholders. As one said: 'This is a classic case of jam tomorrow. We've heard it before.' </p> <p>By no means everyone was negative. A major BSkyB investor said: 'This is a bit like Tesco saying it is going to invest heavily to sustain its sales momentum. Like Tesco, BSkyB is the market leader in its field, so needs to reinforce its lead. Nothing wrong with that.' </p> <p>The problem here is that City analysts have to rethink what this company is all about - where it goes from here and how long it takes to arrive. That means the share price will probably remain wobbly for some time. </p> <p>All the more so because this isn't any old company but BSkyB, and the boss is the 31-year old son of Rupert Murdoch, BSkyB's chairman and the group's main shareholder via his News Corporation, which owns British newspapers such as the Sun and the Times . </p> <p>It hasn't helped that Murdoch Jnr's short tenure - he has been at the helm for just nine months - has been accompanied by a sharp fall in the growth in new subscribers. And this when the controversy over his appointment last autumn is still fresh in people's minds. Remember the charges of nepotism from leading City investors and the threats to vote against his appointment. Only a charm offensive and promises to tighten up on corporate governance swung investors round at the last minute. </p> <p>One problem for Murdoch is that when his predecessor, Tony Ball, was in charge, the City became accustomed to reports that the company was massacring the opposition and that subscriber numbers were rocketing, even though they were tailing off in the final years of Ball's reign. </p> <p>But in the background was the ITV Digital fiasco and the pathetic picture of the cable companies struggling to fend off bankruptcy. Now Murdoch faces a resurgent ITV and a cable industry that has been rescued by creditors and is preparing to combine forces to take on Sky. </p> <p>But it was the launch of Freeview 18 months ago - it now reaches 3.5 million homes - that has fundamentally changed the outlook for pay-TV, making a shift of strategy at BSkyB inevitable. In many ways, Murdoch Jnr has taken the helm at a time of transition and it was never going to be easy. </p> <p>BSkyB needs a more sophisticated marketing message to lift subscriber numbers. What Murdoch calls the 'single megaphone approach' designed to attract just about everyone is no longer appropriate - the pay-TV market is far more developed than a decade ago, with 43 per cent penetration of UK homes. </p> <p>A company insider said: 'These days, BSkyB needs to say different things to different people - those who are attracted by Freeview, for example, may prefer our own free service, which comes on stream this autumn. Others may be persuaded to subscribe to packages at, say, \u00a325 a month, but not \u00a340. We need to get more sophisticated in our marketing approach.' </p> <p>Support for BSkyB's initiative is endorsed, in part, by Patrick Wellington, media expert at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank: 'The strategy to broaden the base of subscribers is not a bad one, and the company will still produce significant earnings growth.' </p> <p>The problem for Wellington and others is that it will take time for Mur doch to attain his goal of 10 million subscribers by the end of 2010. And there is the risk that he may not succeed, although if the company's record is anything to go by, that does not seem likely. BSkyB invested \u00a32bn in digital and free set-top boxes to get that service up and running, and has been remarkably successful. </p> <p>In fact, the story of this company has been about investing huge amounts of risk capital - for instance, to buy the broadcasting rights for Premiership football - and asking investors to hang on for the ride. True, the relationship between the company and the City has not always been smooth, but BSkyB is now hugely profitable and many investors have pocketed handsome returns. </p> <p>But none of that is of immediate help to Lesley Duncan, a director of fund manager Standard Life Investments. 'The question is what level of return can we expect from his [Murdoch's] strategy,' she says. 'We need evidence that the new approach is working.' </p> <p>Another shareholder agreed: 'We liked BSkyB in the mid-Nineties when there was no pay-TV market, but the risks are greater today as there is more competi tion and it may be harder to attract new custom. It's wait and see for us.' </p> <p>And one media analyst said: 'Freeview has really clobbered Sky, a process which has been driven by the BBC.' </p> <p>But BSkyB is hardly down and out. Annual profits, which were scarcely noticed last week, were up four times at nearly \u00a3500m. Sales increased 15 per cent at \u00a33.6bn and the company is returning to the dividend list, as well as holding out the prospect of share buybacks. </p> <p>And, critically, its launch of a free satellite platform in October, offering almost 200 television and radio channels, could once more turn the tide in its favour - especially if new 'free' customers can later be converted into paying ones. What better way for Murdoch to prove himself to a sceptical City?</p>",
  "<p>It was Thursday night by the time a Football Association spokesman emerged from a London hotel room to tell the world that Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson would remain England coach. As the members of the FA's 12-strong board fought their way through the reporters massed outside six hours earlier, they must have longed for the days when 'sports news' consisted of little more than the latest results and the occasional match report. </p> <p>In the three weeks since the News of the World broke the story of Eriksson's affair with FA secretary Faria Alam, the saga has dominated broadsheet and tabloid alike. Scrutiny of the sex life of a public figure is standard tabloid fare, but the FA's attempt to bury the story turned it into a full-blown scandal. It would probably have made the front of most papers in any era, but the prominence afforded to Svengate is indicative of the modern newspaper tendency to run sports stories on the news pages as well as the back pages. </p> <p>A cursory glance at last week's broadsheets reveals a preponderance of sports stories, Svengate aside. The financing and construction of Wembley stadium, London's Olympic bid, security concerns at Athens, the controversial rebranding of the football league and the renaissance of the England cricket team all received ample coverage beyond the back pages. </p> <p>In recent years, the collapse of ITV Digital's deal with the Football League and Formula One's attempt to fight the government's proposed ban on cigarette advertising have regularly featured on the front pages. That this is the case owes much to football and its decade-long transformation from national sport to multi-billion pound industry. </p> <p>'There was a snobbery about sports stories that lasted until the late 1980s,' says Times head of sport Keith Blackmore. 'Then there were some awful sports stories, football stories, that changed all that, Heysel, Hillsborough and the Bradford fire.' Although newspapers covered those incidents just as they would other tragedies, they marked a sea-change in the way sport stories were treated by news editors. </p> <p>For football, Hillsborough marked the beginning of the modern era. In the years that followed, terraces gave way to all-seater stadiums, Rupert Murdoch's Sky poured billions of pounds into the game and a huge rise in players' wages elevated them to the status of showbusiness celebrities. Football became an offshoot of the entertainment industry, a rich source of stories for tabloid journalists since the printing presses started rolling. </p> <p>At the same time, the amount of space given over to football on the sports pages increased exponentially as the game's popularity grew and sports sections expanded to accommodate the increased coverage. 'I'd be surprised if you could find any newspaper that hasn't doubled its sports pages over the past 10 years,' says Blackmore. </p> <p>Football's dominance was not welcomed by all sports journalists. 'Among the old boys there's a feeling that there was a time when football had its place, as did rugby and cricket,' says one. 'Now it's year-long football, with even the most boring stories getting page leads, even in the summer during the off-season, while other sports are glossed over.' </p> <p>But for football writers, this is a golden era. Footballers were not the only ones to benefit from the game's financial windfall; those that write about them also saw their wages soar. Newspaper proprietor Richard Desmond reputedly offered football writer Harry Harris a \u00a3200,000-a-year package to join the Express and others have negotiated lucrative deals. </p> <p>The kudos attached to sports journalism has produced a new breed of football writer - one who is as comfortable writing about the internal politics of Uefa as he is describing England's exit from Euro 2004. Nearly every broadsheet paper, including The Observer, employs a sports news correspondent. </p> <p>With the increased column inches comes a certain amount of influence, even if some are prone to exaggerating the importance of their own views. 'I think they are influential individually and they can be powerful collectively,' says Blackmore. Like their colleagues in the lobby, sports journalists now hunt in packs. 'Once the blood is in the water they can keep a story running.' </p> <p>The Eriksson saga was a textbook example. Where football leads, other sports follow, says Blackmore. </p> <p>'I think we'll see plenty of sports news stories from the Olympics. Twenty-five years ago a drugs story at the Olympic games would have been confined to the sports pages - possibly with a brief on the front. Now it would make the front page. And it will be interesting to see what happens with the England cricket team. If they continue to be successful, they will start appearing in the news pages.' </p> <p><strong>Keep my name out of it</strong></p> <p>It is the first rule of journalism: never reveal your source. As an ex-Daily Mail sports editor, former FA director of communications Colin Gibson knew how stringently Fleet Street observes the 'off-the-record' rule. Without it, it would be nigh on impossible to break news stories. </p> <p>Whatever the ethics of trying to negotiate a deal with a tabloid, Gibson can count himself unlucky to have been comprehensively 'turned over' by the News of the World, but an off-the-record discussion has no status in law and is entirely dependent on trust - a commodity sometimes in short supply in the news journalism. </p> <p>The Press Complaints Commission's code of conduct is silent on this issue, apart from declaring in clause 14, headed 'Confidential sources' that 'journalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information'. </p> <p>When a newspaper breaks the code, it often invokes the catch-all public interest clause to justify its actions. That was the News of the World's defence. 'We are not Catholic priests,' said a spokesman. </p> <p>It is not the first time this has happened. At the height of the Kelly affair last year, Paul Waugh of the Independent wrote about 'a senior Whitehall source' having suggested that Kelly was a Walter Mitty character. It didn't take long for rivals to reveal that source as Number 10 'spin doctor' Tom Kelly. </p> <p>During the 1997 election campaign, Sunday Times columnist AA Gill reported John Prescott's off-the-record admission that introducing the minimum wage would increase unemployment. 'I don't think journalists should be made co-conspirators in hiding the news they're paid to report,' he wrote following the subsequent furore. </p> <p>It may be an unpalatable truth, but when deadlines loom and news is in short supply, some journalists will 'burn' a contact if the story is good enough.</p>",
  "<p>There's an email joke going around about the latest US position to be outsourced to India: President of the United States. </p> <p>Is the new appointee a bit shaky on some of the issues? To enable him to answer those he doesn't understand, says the spoof announcement, he will be given call centre-type scripts to follow. This will allow additional savings to be realised 'as these scripting tools have already been used by Mr Bush in the US'. </p> <p>Actually, leaving Bush out of it, the joke may be nearer the mark than many people suppose. Behind press stories about the shift of call centre and low-level number-crunching jobs abroad, something much more fundamental is afoot, which will have implications for Western companies across the board. </p> <p>We already know, for instance, that by using better methods, some Indian firms are producing software that is not just cheaper but of far higher quality than almost all their Western counterparts. </p> <p>But in many other areas, too, from banking to shampoo to health, the testing conditions of the developing world are giving birth to cost and quality innovations that dramatically undercut the bloated business models of the West. </p> <p>Some are recounted in CK Prahalad's new book, The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid (Wharton School Press). While some are well known - for example, the extraordinary success of the Grameen Bank's microlending concept in Bangladesh - others are less so. </p> <p>Take Casas Bahia, which has built one of Brazil's largest retail chains selling consumer goods to the shanty towns; or India's Aravind eye hospital, which may be the best place in the world to have a cataract removed. At its four sites, Aravind treats 1.4 million patients and carries out 196,000 operations a year. The cost per cataract: $25, compared with $1,500-$2,000 in the US. </p> <p>As these examples show, to put down today's shifts as 'outsourcing' - a transfer of employment scraps from the rich man's table - is patronising and simplistic. It's not just the international division of labour but the whole ecology of business that's changing. And among the prized Western entities in the front line are brands. </p> <p>Look at it like this. It's now a given that you can get any commodity item you like, industrial or consumer, from the Far East without sacrificing reliability or quality. What you can't get (yet) is a brand. </p> <p>But the brand, points out Paul Pankhurst, chairman of innovation consultancy PDD, while increasingly critical, is also becoming harder to sustain. For instance, he notes that 'there are now turn-key design services in India and Taiwan - so you can take not just the manufacture of an athletic shoe or mobile phone offshore, but the design and development work too'. </p> <p>You can also mobilise a workforce the size of the population of Guildford in a week to ramp up production. Few Western firms can compete with that. The implications are profound. Brand holders have been pushed right to the top of the value chain. This means that they have less and less of the total activity to make their money from: just distribution and the brand itself. </p> <p>That puts a premium on innovation. But - as companies are starting to comprehend - innov ative capacity is traditionally closely linked to manufacturing (new products often being dependent on new processes). By the same token, as the new turn-key houses are growing up, the in-house innovation capability of the brand owners is inexorably going down. </p> <p>Outsourcing, as some of us have maintained all along, is not a one-way street. In return for lower costs (maybe) in the short term, 'advanced' firms in the developed economies have fragmented and given away increasingly high-level know-how which is being elegantly reassembled and sold back to them - and their competitors. Which means there's a differentiation problem, too. Says Pankhurst: 'The more you embrace outsourcing, the more you lose control.' </p> <p>Testimony to the shift is his own firm, which has recently set up a subsidiary called Carbonate to develop and incubate new ideas. Carbonate's first new product, the Deck, is a multipurpose exercise platform that was the brainchild of Loughborough University. Carbonate helped to develop and design it (in return for equity) and, crucially, matched it to a brand (Reebok) which can give it much better distribution than it could manage on its own. </p> <p>The Deck, says Pankhurst, sums up many of the changing aspects of innovation. On the one hand, university departments and small companies are finding it harder and harder to mobilise the clout to commercialise their intellectual property; on the other hand, brand owners are in desperate need of new ideas. </p> <p>The 'brand bit' is now absolutely key, he says. In the past, a leading consultancy would have sold engineering and behavioural research; now it's marketing, brand planning and product mapping - 'stuff we didn't even think about five years ago'. </p> <p>Western companies will have to have a solid brand and distribution to survive, he says. That goes for companies not just in consumer goods but also in business-to-business sectors. But they'll have to be a lot better at it than they are now. A good start would be learning to value and husband the unique know-how they have been so nonchalantly dissipating. Without innovation, there'll be nothing left to outsource. </p> <p><strong>Eastern rising</strong></p> <p>India, says CK Prahalad, will soon be turning out six million graduates a year, compared with 1.9 million in China and 1.7 million in the United States. Bangalore is about to overtake Silicon Valley as the largest concentration of IT employment on the planet. </p> <p>Don't fight it, says Prahalad, a thinker respected in both business and academic circles. While the vast majority of the world's poorest are still criminally disenfranchised and excluded from world markets, his new book shows that, where they are given a chance, they can be a source of extraordinary innovation. </p> <p>The book is in part a crusade for an 'inclusive capitalism' to replace the failed model of aid as a vehicle for development. Giving the poor the dignity of choice as consumers, he says, is not just a question of social justice: it can reinvent capitalism. </p> <p>Many famous Western companies (eg Marks and Spencer) began by serving the poor - not as a matter of charity but of commercial innovation. Some are rejuvenating themselves by returning to those roots. To sell shampoo in single-shot sachets, Lever Hindustan had to transform both manufacture and distribution. Sales have rocketed. </p> <p>But Prahalad's examples should also serve as an alarm call. Given the opportunity, the poor find commercial uses for mobile phones and PCs that rich Western firms would never dream of. Some of these will certainly make their way to the West. Firms that have forgotten where they came from, or think that innovation is 'launching a 74th line of instant coffee', had better beware. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Mitchell's poetry is soapbox rhetoric, a rallying cry for pacifism and socialism, for 'the work to do' and 'beating your head against a brick wall'.

Stillborn siblings are a 'Silence like nothing/ but not nothing... Implacable O', echoing the murder of her relatives by the Japanese in Korea. Her grandmother's friend lies killed, his 'eye grown large with everything it saw... pupil of suffering./ Lonely O.' This cycle of nothingness necessitates a search for answers: 'Have you ever hurt your heart.. asking why what happened/ happened'?</p> <p>Poems of pain spill and stall, insisting to be written and read.

  "<p>I don't know about you, but when the critics say something is a 'five-star classic', I'm on my guard. There's certainly a lot going for the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0241142695/guardianunlim-21\">McSweeney's</a>, Dave Eggers's quarterly literary magazine, which in its current incarnation is a 'comics only' special edited and designed by the great Chris Ware (No 13, Hamish Hamilton, \u00a316.99). There's the roster of more than a dozen top alternative cartoonists for starters (no superhero strips allowed); the vintage material by George Herriman ('Krazy Kat') and Charles Schulz ('Peanuts'); plus the text contributions by writers including John Updike just to underline the book's literariness and bookshop orientation.</p> <p>Individual strips are fantastic. Robert Crumb's meditation on the insecurities of two would-be lovers (cheekily introduced as 'another unfunny modern \"comic\" for discriminating adult intellectuals') takes him into wordier territory than he is commonly associated with and shows that at the age of 60 he has lost none of his powers of observation. Meanwhile, there's the design of the book itself, which makes the most of unusually high production values, to the point where the wrap-around cover acts as a comic in its own right.</p> <p>But it doesn't quite work. The mix is too rich, and a large proportion of the strips have been seen elsewhere before (most disappointingly in the cases of Art Spiegelman, Chester Brown and Joe Sacco). A good anthology is about more than its contents. It has to have a mood (check out existing periodicals Blab! and Drawn &amp; Quarterly). Ware must have been aware of this, and also that the mood most likely to be generated by the wedding of his own reputation with that of McSweeney's would be an ostentatiously cool one. Alas for him, true cool is never ostentatious, which is why the book is 'good' rather than 'five stars'.</p> <p>Le Gun (No 1, Le Gun Publishing, \u00a38) is an anthology of a different kind, and consists of 'narrative illustration' rather than comic strips per se. It's put together by students at the Royal College of Art, and is where, allegedly: 'Imaginative people spill their minds.' Meaning, in this case, other students plus a few famous friends (Peter Blegvad and Les Coleman).</p> <p>It's refreshing to see a book taking inspiration from fine art rather than the world of cartooning - Jean Michel Basquiat and David Shrigley seem to be favourites. And there's plenty of terrific material. Richard Galloway's lino-cuts of seedy Paris bars are so atmospheric you can smell the Gauloise smoke. However, unfortunate bouts of art college smartarsery mean that Le Gun is more of a spattering Uzi than a precision weapon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/189659784X/guardianunlim-21\">Seth's Clyde Fans</a> (Book 1, Drawn &amp; Quarterly, \u00a313.99) is a graphic novel telling the story of two brothers who set out to sell electric fans to homes and businesses in North America at a time when air conditioning is taking over. This tragi-comic premise forms the background to the efforts of one of the brothers, Simon, to clinch a deal. At stake is his self-esteem, the approval of his brother, and the future of the business.</p> <p>What is so affecting about the book is its unhurried nature. For example, there are a large number of silent panels, making Simon's sales pitches seem even more excruciating ('Of course, I-I understand your loyalty to a b-brand...') It's the achievement of Clyde Fans that it becomes a metaphor for anybody who has failed to 'close' in life.</p> <p>Carol Swain's graphic novella <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/156097575X/guardianunlim-21\">Foodboy</a> (Fantagraphics, \u00a37.99) is a disturbing yarn about a youth who brings scraps of food to his friend who is living a feral existence in the wildest terrains of mid-Wales. Both young men are alienated from their homeland, which is pictured as a desolate landscape of glacial valleys and dense woodland punctuated by tourist villages and hippie communes. In the end Foodboy can't tempt his pal back to civilisation, and you're left wondering who is better off.</p> <p>Swain's charcoal artwork is perfect for the sheer overcast-ness of the story, and her penchant for 'camera angles', somewhat distracting in her previous comics, is used to eerie effect. They add to the visual echoes - a pattern in the veins of a piece of meat becomes the outline of a mountain becomes a peace symbol - which evoke the echoing sounds of the valleys. A chilly, satisfying piece of work.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0810948311/guardianunlim-21\">Auschwitz</a> (Harry N. Abrams Inc, \u00a311.95) by Pascal Croci, is one of those hardback glossies that give Eurocomics a bad name. A well-meaning fictionalisation of the memoirs of Jewish survivors, it is drawn in a black and white 'realistic' style that is clearly meant to be a riposte to the controversial anthropomorphics of Maus. However, the characters end up looking like extras from the musical Les Miserables and the most shocking thing about it is the editing ('Mendele' for 'Mengele'? Per-lease...) The references to other genocides - notably in the former Yugoslavia - are interesting but clunkily made, and, again, can be interpreted as a comment on Maus. But by comparison, that book looks all the more impressive.</p> <p>Finally, an excellent study about manga that seeks to explode the dictionary definition of 'comics with a science fiction or fantasy theme'. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1856693910/guardianunlim-21\">Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics</a> (Laurence King, \u00a319.95) by Paul Gravett is beautifully illustrated with 360 examples taking in everything from early hits such as Astro Boy, through diverse indie manga, to more recent 'tits and tentacles' fodder.</p> <p>It's not terribly critical (you won't hear much about sweatshop conditions in the Tokyo studios), but then illustrated books can rarely afford to be these days, bearing in mind copyright clearances. As a celebration of an often misunderstood aspect of modern comics, it does an admirable job of squashing racist myths and of only mentioning the dreaded Pok\u00e9mon twice.</p>",

  "<p>\"The baseless allegations of theft and extortion are outrageous and unacceptable\". Such was the righteous indignation with which Gail Berman, the Fox network's head of entertainment, greeted accusations that she was the boss of a crew of crooks and hustlers specialising in the pre-emptive capsizing of other networks' reality shows.</p> <p>Addressing a conference of TV critics, who'd previously heard Fox's copycating methodology disparaged by the presidents of ABC and NBC, Berman accused her rivals of shameless ingenuousness, claiming that they all swam in a bloody shark pit and that she was simply playing by long established rules.</p> <p>Meanwhile, her company is caught red-handed pilfering ABC's main hope for an autumn reality hit - a concept entitled Wife Swap, I don't know if you're in any way familiar with it - and tossing it onto the air under the sappy title Trading Spouses: Meet Your New Mommy. Adding insult to injury, the knock-off has not only become an instant summer hit but, on the evidence of the first couple of episodes, it's as addictive as the original.</p> <p>Although I'm conditioned to perceive any American adaptation of a British idea as inferior, I can't imagine any of the hatchet-faced harridans swapping lots in the UK turning out as satisfying as the juxtaposition of Tammy Nakamura and Al Mela Biggins. Tammy, the blonde Texan trophy wife of a Japanese plastic surgeon, utters endless homilies about the \"power of positivism\" through an ever-present tight smile of condescension, and treats her mother-in-law as an indentured servant allowed to live in their luxury home solely for the purposes of cooking and cleaning. Al Mela is a chubby, black, southern, working-class mom.</p> <p>Channel 4 audiences are primed to anticipate culture clash and histrionics but it didn't quite turn out that way. Tammy, who voiceovered something to the effect that she saw herself like a missionary venturing among the backward tribes and offering a glimpse at better way of life, devolved into an immobile, bedridden petty dictator, issuing endless demands which were ignored by her adoptive family, who treated her like a pet that had quickly changed from a novelty to a flatulent waste of space.</p> <p>Even when Tammy was lecturing one of the Biggins' crisp-munching kids to change her diet otherwise she would die very soon, she was treated with baffled tolerance.</p> <p>Al Mela Biggins, blessed with none of Tammy's vast allocation of delusional self-belief, had no expectations about what she'd bring to the Nakamuras' life. Within - reality show edited - minutes of her moving in, she was helping the son with his jigsaw (\"Mom would never do this,\" marvelled the kid), going for a pedicure with the daughter and, most importantly, bonding with the shunned and overworked mother-in-law.</p> <p>In a climactic twist included for the sole purposes of Fox defending themselves against the accusation of Spouses being a direct steal from Wife Swap, the participating families each receive $50,000 with the condition that the mothers decide how their adopted families spend the money.</p> <p>Tammy, relishing the chance to play God with the Biggins' lives, divided the money up into a endless series of subsections designed to ensure that no one would actually get a chance to enjoy their windfall. Tammy then opened the letter containing Al Mela's instructions as to the disbursement of the 50 grand. She probably only looked at the letter for a few seconds but in TV time, it was an eternity before she was forced to reveal that Al Mela had given the whole cheque to Tammy's mother-in-law! Proving gracious to the end, Tammy pronounced herself glad because \"she has to pay taxes on it\".</p> <p>Now I know what you're thinking: this sounds almost heartwarming. Heartwarming and Wife Swap are mutually exclusive concepts. All I can tell you is that Trading Spouses' worked from its opening seconds and never stopped working. This is small consolation to ABC who, not only have to launch Wife Swap, but were about to announce their purchase of the Supernanny format only to find that Fox already had Nanny 911 going into production.</p>",
  "<p>\"All I want is a new washing machine,\" said Iris Jeffrey, the biggest ever winner of the national lottery, as she posed with a giant cardboard cheque. Handed a magnum of champagne, she admitted she didn't know how to open it. </p> <p>Mrs Jeffrey, a retired home help from a Protestant terrace in Belfast's Shankill Road, had bought a lucky dip ticket at Tesco. She played the same numbers every week. </p> <p>A determined bingo player who had never won anything in her life, she had bought a ticket every week since the game was launched 10 years ago. </p> <p>But as lottery workers searched Northern Ireland to find the winner of the unclaimed \u00a320.1m rollover jackpot, Mrs Jeffrey was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer of the gullet. She had forgotten about the ticket in a cupboard at home until she saw a plea on the local news for people to check their pockets. </p> <p>She said: \"I asked my daughter to check for me. When she confirmed the win I said, 'Ooh, I've won, that's nice. That's lovely.' Then I had a glass of milk and went to bed.\" </p> <p>Mrs Jeffrey said her first priority was replacing her broken washing machine. </p> <p>\"What's important is the health of your family and friends. I'm going to make sure that my family and friends are secure,\" she said. </p> <p>The July 14 rollover made Mrs Jeffrey the biggest single winner in national lottery history. A syndicate once got \u00a322m but had to share the winnings. </p> <p>Mrs Jeffrey's daughter Wendy, 32, said their priority was to look abroad for cancer treatment. Mrs Jeffrey, who was diagnosed with cancer in April, will undergo an operation on her gullet next month. </p> <p>The family have been advised to leave their north Belfast terrace in an area which suffered the worst bloodshed of Northern Ireland's 30-year troubles. But Mrs Jeffrey said she would miss her neighbours. </p> <p>The family said it was impossible to keep the win a secret in their close community. \"We can't plan a holiday because of my treatment. But we might go to Blackpool for five days,\" Mrs Jeffrey said. </p> <p>Awaiting her first grandchild in nine days, Mrs Jeffrey said the family would be seeking advice from Peter Lavery, a retired Belfast bus driver who won \u00a310m in 1996. </p> <p>\"I've never been lucky until now,\" she said.</p>",
  "It is perhaps the most dastardly legacy of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the violent, pizza-addicted reptiles who nunchucked their way across television and cinema screens in the early 1990s. <p>Ducklings have been dragged under water and a mallard had its leg ripped off by marauding terrapins in front of tearful children in north London. </p> <p>A gang of 25 dinner plate-sized warriors has established itself at Sheepwash Pond in Mill Hill after the unwanted pets were abandoned in the pond as the passion for the cartoon turtles named after Renaissance masters died away. </p> <p>When they were purchased, the red-eared terrapins would have been the size of a 50p, but have grown to 30cm, becom ing too large and expensive to keep as pets.

  "Among the papers left by the American journalist Gloria Emerson, who has apparently committed suicide, aged 75, to escape the increasing disablement from Parkinson's disease, was her own obituary, recalling how she initially ran away from \"an alcoholic, wretched home\" to work for a hotel giveaway magazine. She went on to write award-winning accounts of the Vietnam war and other late 20th-century conflicts. <p>In 1957, Emerson applied for a job with the New York Times, and recalled how \"getting a job on the women's page was a gift from heaven\". But her memoir also spelled out the frustrating reality of the work. \"I hated writing about shoes and clothes, all under the eye of the advertising department, who measured editorial mentions of retailers.\" </p> <p>After three years, she moved to Brussels with the man who became her second husband. She rejoined the paper in 1964, and was initially assigned to cover the Paris fashion shows before being transferred to the London bureau in 1968. She reported for a time on the growing crisis in Northern Ireland, but constantly agitated to be sent to Saigon. As she later recalled, \"I was allowed to go to Vietnam because the war was supposed to be over, so it didn't matter if a female was sent\". </p> <p>Emerson had previously visited Saigon as a freelance journalist, when it was still under French control, and was shocked by its appearance on her return. </p> <p>\"There were so many little hideous places on what had been the Rue Catinat - Big Boy Hamburgers - and the war had cut down the trees to widen the streets for military traffic. That was so sad and so painful. The city had been deformed in a hundred different ways. It had a kind of sepsis. The war had gone into every corner of every life. The Vietnamese value harmony very much. There was no harmony, there was no order, there was no calm.\" </p> <p>By this stage, of course, the Nixon administration in Washington was rapidly reducing America's involvement in the war, so the military burden fell increasingly on the Vietnamese. Emerson concentrated her reports on the effect this was having on the people. </p> <p>She cut away from the main press corps, becoming such a maverick that her bureau chief, Alvin Schuster, swore she would give him a heart attack before he was 40. One of her regular unofficial activities was to persuade airline crews to smuggle antibiotics into the country to treat injured children. </p> <p>Emerson's was never an easy personality. Unusually tall, she had her lighter side and was often extremely witty, but she could equally be overbearing and protective of what she claimed as her own territory - an understandable reaction, perhaps, in a woman working in an excessively macho culture. She had difficulties with photographers, constantly interfering with their work in the apparent belief that their brief images would overshadow her carefully crafted prose. </p> <p>In part, this insecurity seemed based on her early years, though the details remained shadowy. She came from wealthy parents, who had lost their oil fortune through alcoholism, though she later benefited from a small family trust income. When she first joined the New York Times at 28, she described herself as a widow, giving her married name as Znamiecki, though no more was ever known of the circumstances. Her second marriage to Charles Broferrio, which brought her to Europe, ended within a year. She said later that she had only married these two Europeans \"for their history\". </p> <p>By contrast, the reports Emerson filed from the conflicts in Vietnam, Nigeria, Palestine and Algeria were passionately empathetic to the sufferings of those innocently caught up in the fighting. </p> <p>In 1972, trying to get the point across to an indifferent readership, she wrote that \"Americans cannot perceive - even the most decent among us - the suffering caused by the United States air war in Indochina, and how huge are the graveyards we have created there. To a reporter recently returned from Vietnam, it often seems that much of our fury and fear is reserved for busing, abortion, mugging and liberation of some kind. Our deepest emotions are wired to baseball players.\" </p> <p>Emerson's account of a year living through the intifada in Gaza noted that the Palestinians were \"made to feel inferior, treated with contempt and cruelty [and] struggled to transcend their own feelings of helplessness\". It brought predictable condemnation from pro-Israeli groups, to which she mildly responded that she had simply hoped to provide a primer for those who felt the Middle East situation was too complicated, or too controversial, to understand. </p> <p>Emerson won a number of awards but later, acknowledging that she had spent a third of her life covering wars, observed ruefully that nothing she had ever learned from it had been of any benefit. \"I think that writing about war is a way of raising the dead and hoping you will see them again.\" She left no surviving relations. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gloria Emerson, journalist, born 1929; died August 3 2004</p>",
  "<b>Linda Mortimer says: </b> \"I understand why following in the footsteps of someone so obviously keen on socialising may cause you concern, but please don't discount socialising. <p>You may be surprised how beneficial it can be to see your colleagues in a different light and away from the office. It can be the key to building positive relationships at work. Relaxed social settings are perfect for team-building and colleagues from a strong team are likely to be happier at work, have better team-working skills and stay in their jobs for longer. </p> <p>Why not find out if this is actually what your team wants? It may be that many social events are getting tiresome and the team may have felt obliged to attend nights out in the past. Ask someone in the team to conduct a poll to discover if this level of social activity is required. </p> <p>If your colleagues thrive on the social scene, set up an entertainment committee to give them some control over the type of events to organise. There is no need to attend every time but do try to support these events and go to one or two.

If you feel forced to take part in these ac tivities it will be obvious to all that you are not enjoying yourself and that may restrict their enjoyment too. However, I would imagine the social aspect is such an integral part of their work life, it will continue with, you or without, you. </p> <p>You obviously don't want to be seen as a kill-joy.

Is there a compromise that would suit you all? You could organise a quarterly team day which would be a mixture of business (reviewing the performance of the company, the team, celebrating individual successes etc), team building activities (treasure hunts, quizzes, fun competitive events) followed by an evening social event.

  "Lieutenant Colonel Gary Johnston, operations officer for the unit: \"With no doubt in my mind, the Iraqi forces and multinational forces were attacked. There were gunfights through the day. Helicopters and more forces were called in to support. Late yesterday afternoon we went ahead and proceeded into the exclusion zone and set up a buffer. <p>\"The governor imposed a curfew last night and traffic control points have been sealed to prevent anti-Iraq forces outside the town entering, and to stop those inside leaving. </p> <p>\"Historically the cemetery has been used by Moqtada [al-Sadr's] militia to cache weapons and to use as a safe haven because it was in the exclusion zone. The cemetery has been the origin of many attacks on Iraqi police stations. </p> <p>\"We received heavy fire and were attacked and we attacked back. The lack of discipline among the anti-Iraqi forces led to many friendly Iraqis being injured or killed during the attack. There were also indications of foreign fighters alongside the Moqtada militia. The battlefield is very fluid at the moment. It is difficult to say - is it local gangs firing in one area, or is it kids picking up guns they have found and firing them at us, or is it anti-Iraqi forces? </p> <p>\"Our mission is not focused on any particular individual, it is to support the governor of Najaf. We are not at war with him [Mr Sadr], we are here to support the Iraqi forces and the Iraqi people. </p> <p>\"If you kill a marine, the marines are going to fight back. That's why there is intense fighting that these folks are probably not used to.\" </p> <p> </p> <p>Colonel Anthony Haslam, base commander and chief of operations, added: \"You have to move very slowly because the cemetery has a lot of mausoleums and little caves. Our mission is to sweep through the cemetery and clear out the Moqtada militia in there. </p> <p>\"It is really a shame. We are here to build infrastructure and restore stability. The poor Iraqi police force do not have a chance. They are attacked and they are outgunned. Without eliminating that threat, this city will never be stable.\"</p>",
  "It began at the heavily barricaded blue police station of Najaf at 1am on Thursday. <p>From the ancient cemetery nearby, a crowd of gunmen attacked with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. </p> <p>As the fighting escalated, the governor of Najaf called in the US 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based in the desert 30 miles away and just two weeks into its mission to secure one of the most politically sensitive sites in the country. </p> <p>Within 48 hours, Iraq was seeing its most serious fighting for weeks, and stood on the precipice of yet another big religious revolt, with US forces claiming they had already killed 300 insurgents. </p> <p>Behind the violence is the dilemma facing the new Iraqi government about how it should handle the young radical Shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, who has the proven ability to gather thousands of disenchanted, well-armed young Iraqi men to fight his cause. </p> <p>If the Iraqi administration - with the help of American forces - has decided that this is the time to make a final move against Mr Sadr, the country could be convulsed by violence. Leaving him be, though, may be considered a risky strategy too. </p> <p>In the days of the occupation, the US military struggled with the same conundrum. For months it ignored and underestimated Mr Sadr, who is wanted on suspicion of involvement in the murder of another cleric last year. Then, in late March, the US clumsily closed down his newspaper, arrested one of his lieutenants and threatened to kill Mr Sadr himself. </p> <p>It triggered an unprecedented uprising in cities across southern Iraq that left dozens of US soldiers and hundreds of Iraqis dead. It was the first time US forces had turned Iraq's Shia majority against them. </p> <p>In the end a ceasefire was carefully agreed, in which Mr Sadr's men would stop fighting and the US military would agree to keep out of an \"exclusion zone\" in the centre of the holy city of Najaf. </p> <p>The ceasefire is now in tatters, with both sides claiming the other breached it first. </p> <p>The truth will remain disputed, but it is clear that the military operations come at a time when the new Iraqi government, and perhaps the newly arrived marine unit, want to stamp their authority on the country's relentless security crisis. </p> <p>\"We will not negotiate,\" said the interior minister, Falah Naqib. \"We have power to stop these people, and we'll kick them out of the country.\" </p> <p>It may be no coincidence that the operations also come at a time when the most respected voice of reason and moderation among the Shia clergy, the elderly Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has left the country for heart treatment in London - one of the first times he has left his home in Najaf for years. </p> <p>Mr Sadr, a chubby, dark-haired young man, is the son of a deeply respected ayatollah who was murdered by Saddam's men in 1999. He left a powerful legacy upon which his young son trades shamelessly. </p> <p>Although Mr Sadr, 30, is dismissed as an extremist by Iraq's educated Shia middle classes, he does have considerable ability to harness the frustration of the poor unemployed young men of Iraq who have yet to see any real benefits to their lives from the occupation. </p> <p>His last uprising in April brought serious revolts in Baghdad and the towns of the Shia south: Kerbala, Najaf, Kut, Amara, Nassiriya and Basra. They were as well coordinated as they were violent. </p> <p>Yesterday the US marines showed how little they have understood his movement when they insisted on describing his men as \"anti-Iraqi forces\". </p> <p>The fighters are of course Iraqis, more extreme perhaps than most, but carrying the frustrations of the majority. </p> <p>At midday prayers at the mosque controlled by the Sadr movement in Basra yesterday, Sheikh Assad al-Basri had to control a crowd of several hundred worshippers as they shouted \"To jihad!\" </p> <p>In April, Basra was the scene of some of the fiercest fighting. Yesterday two British army Land Rovers waited a short distance away. This time the cleric told the men to be ready but to wait. </p> <p>He said they should fight those who tried to destroy their religion, and ridiculed the \"great devil, America\". He told the crowd: \"We don't want American Islam.\" </p> <p>Since the ceasefire agreement in June, Mr Sadr had switched his attention to enforcing a particular hardline moral code in his community. </p> <p>In Baghdad, his men have formed a religious police force, the Force for the Promotion of Virtue. They patrol the streets, targeting off-licences and prostitutes. </p> <p>There is little doubt that he is preparing a powerful political movement that will be unpalatable to many. </p> <p>He has vowed not to take part in politics while the US military remains in Iraq, but he may yet have his eye on the first general elections due in January next year. </p> <p>Mr Sadr did not appear as he usually does for midday prayers at his mosque in Kufa, next to Najaf, yesterday. </p> <p>But another cleric read his words of defiance, telling the crowd: \"I say America is our enemy and the enemy of the people, and we will not accept its partnership. </p> <p>\"You have taken this path and you have to put up with the dangers and the obstacles. Heaven does not come without a price.\"</p>",
  "<p>It won't come as much of a surprise if you've parked at a UK airport but British holidaymakers are paying the highest parking charges in the world ... more than Tokyo, New York and even Singapore, according to a Jobs &amp; Money survey this week. </p> <p>We found that even at international airports, where land values are the highest in the world, prices are lower than London. </p> <p>Our investigation, which is bound to re-ignite the great \"Rip-off Britain\" debate, found that Heathrow in west London tops the league - by some margin. </p> <p>Those who simply turn up at its long-stay car park and leave their car for a week, have to stump up \u00a398. Even if they pre-book, it costs \u00a366.50, which is still higher than Tokyo and Singapore - the two places with the highest land costs and highest car taxes, respectively. </p> <p><strong>How to cut costs</strong></p> <p>Generally, it is cheaper if you pre-book - either using the airport's website or by phoning ahead. Most companies require 24 or 48 hours notice to pre-pay, and Bristol customers get a bigger discount if they book a week ahead. </p> <p>Bizarrely, however, some car parks charge more if you pre-book than if you just turn up. The position is particularly confusing at Gatwick - this week it was quoting \u00a350.40 if paid in advance or \u00a344.80 on the day. Also when we rang the Gatwick parking number, we were offered the lowest price of all - just because we rang that day. </p> <p>Near Stansted, the Bishop's Stortford football club has long been offering a rival parking service which is a little cheaper than the official parking, and can be quicker. Most airports now have rivals offering to undercut the official parking firms. </p> <p>A huge number of websites offer to book airport parking cheaply. Try <a href=\"http://www.airparks.co.uk\">airparks.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.parking4less.co.uk\">parking4less.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uk-airport-parking.co.uk\">uk-airport-parking.co.uk</a> </p> <p>And nearer to home in Malaga - the destination of so many British holidaymakers - leaving your car in the short-stay car park for a week costs \u00a340. Stay in the mid-term car park at Stansted, however, and you pay \u00a366 if you pre-book, \u00a387 if you don't. </p> <p>Our table shows the very cheapest rates we could find at the airports. </p> <p>Last year the British Airports Authority, the privatised company that owns seven of the largest airports in the UK, earned \u00a3142m from travellers leaving their cars, equal to around a quarter of its group profits. It sets the tariffs charged by outside companies which operate the car parks on its behalf. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money compared the cost of parking for one week at airports across the UK during the holiday season with those charged abroad. And we were staggered at the difference. </p> <p>Frankfurt was the next most expensive after Heathrow at \u00a369.40 - but you can park for up to two weeks. </p> <p>Tokyo's Narita airport is not cheap at \u00a361 a week, but still a third less than Heathrow. </p> <p>In Paris, Charles de Gaulle airport costs \u00a352 for a week, while a German family setting out from Frankfurt will pay \u00a366 to leave a Mercedes - but will get up to 14 days. </p> <p>Property prices aren't cheap in New York, but anyone leaving a Cadillac at JFK pays \u00a340 a week. They can also pay in half-day segments. </p> <p>Ironically, the country that has some of the stiffest anti-car measures, has some of the lowest parking charges. Singapore's Changi airport has to be one of the world's bargains at \u00a337 a week. </p> <p>Even around the UK the prices vary enormously - in Glasgow travellers pay the lowest charges of all the airports we surveyed (see table). Turning up unannounced costs \u00a334.30, pre-booking cuts that to \u00a328. </p> <p>Over at Gatwick, the best offer we could get was \u00a341.65 for a week - but that was only because we were given a 15% discount because \"the operator in question had space that day\". </p> <p>Those who simply turn up at the long-stay car park pay \u00a358.20 - falling by just \u00a32 if you pre-book on-line. </p> <p>At least the high prices can be justified by the high price of local land. </p> <p>However, the same can't be said of Stansted in Essex built on a green field site. Agricultural land adjacent to the terminal would hardly be considered expensive by London standards, and yet those jetting off are forced to pay \u00a347.60 at the Pink Elephant long stay car park. </p> <p>It is not just a problem at BAA's own airports. At Man chester we were quoted \u00a347.60 if we pre-booked (\u00a31 more if we didn't) but it has a bizarre pricing structure that means you have to pay for eight days, even if you only parked for seven consecutive periods of 24 hours. </p> <p>At Bristol there is a big discount for booking at least seven days in advance, but prices were a bit more reasonable - if you book ahead. </p> <p>Trevor Jones, who is in charge of parking at Stansted, says he has no control over the prices. </p> <p>\"As the landlord, BAA sets the prices. If you want to know why they are so high, you'll have to talk to BAA,\" he said. </p> <p>BAA argues that it uses its income from parking to keep its airport charges amongst the lowest in the world. </p> <p>\"We offer a range of car parking to meet our cus tomers' needs,\" it said, \"either adding convenience (closer to the terminal, valet parking) or more cost-effective options (long-stay). Customers can save money even further by pre-booking on the internet, a service offered for mid and long-stay car parks and guarantees a space.\" </p> <p>It also paid to build the Heathrow Express which it also owns - named the most expensive rail journey per mile in the world when it opened. Last year it earned \u00a314m. </p> <p>One group who are able to avoid the sky-high cost of airport parking is MPs. They are given free passes, worth \u00a31,300 a year, to park at BAA airports. The company recently fought off attempts to scrap the perk.</p>",
  "<p>You know you've arrived somewhere pretty swanky long before you actually see Ch\u00e2teau Mont Royal. First, there are the smart navy-blue road signs directing you through the village (La Chapelle-en-Serval), then you have to announce your arrival on the intercom to open the sliding electronic gate; once you're in, the long driveway winds its way up through the forest, past the tennis court and the helipad, before finally reaching the pale stone chateau. </p> <p>Once inside, the sweeping staircase looks custom-made for Scarlett O'Hara-style entrances, and through double glass doors you catch a glimpse of a chandelier and a wall painted with cherubs - the breakfast room. So far, so grand. </p> <p>Our room, in the new wing, was a good size but not quite in keeping with the rest of the property; bland and vaguely corporate, the decor was out of the \"could be anywhere in the world\" school of design. (Tip - ask for a room in the original part of the building, they cost the same but have more character and in some cases little balconies overlooking the forest). </p> <p>But aside from the room, Mont Royal fitted the bill. We'd come to France for a treat - a few days of eating good food and drinking fine wine, in pleasant surroundings; and within half an hour of arriving we were sitting on the large terrace in the early evening sunshine, sipping kir royals. Looking out across the treetops, the drive from Calais seemed a distant memory and we were already feeling spoiled. </p> <p>That night, we ate a \"light\" gourmet meal in the chateau's Stradivarius restaurant - all wood panelling, parquet flooring, heavy drapes and whispered conversations. Later, as we waddled towards the bar, we agreed we couldn't possibly manage breakfast, but 10 hours later were back downstairs scoffing chocolate mousse and croissants. Fortunately, Mont Royal has a tennis court (as well as pool, small gym and bikes), so after a pre-breakfast match, we didn't feel quite as guilty piling our plates at the buffet. </p> <p>Built as a hunting base in 1911 by a French composer, Ch\u00e2teau Mont Royal sits on a hill surrounded by the Chantilly forest, 25km north of Paris. It became a hotel in 1992 and with Charles de Gaulle airport a 15-minute drive down the A1, is often used as a convenient overnight stop by holidaymakers catching a flight home next day. But if you spend just one night, you're missing out. North-east France is probably best known for the first world war battlefields and memorials, but closer to Paris there are medieval towns, ancient abbeys and gothic cathedrals surrounded by countryside captured by Vincent Van Gogh. </p> <p>The nearest town to Mont Royal is Senlis, where after a quick scoot round the Notre Dame cathedral, we spent the afternoon ambling along cobbled streets marvelling at how one small town can sustain so many hairdressers and perfumeries. When the heat and the cobbles started to take their toll, we ducked into Le Comptoir Senlisien, a gorgeous bar/salon du th\u00e9, stacked to the ceiling with fancy chocolate, jams and olive oils, and drank honey-coloured malt beer. For dinner, we plumped for the simplest option, the local rotisserie, which provided the cheapest meal of our stay - a vast entrecote with fr\u00eetes for \u20ac17. </p> <p> Nearby Chantilly's attractions are on a much grander scale. The road from Ch\u00e2teau Mont Royal passes directly in front of Chantilly chateau - in fact two chateaux - the Petit, dating back to the early 1500s, and the Grand, a fairytale castle built by the Duke d'Aumale between 1822 and 1897. The Duke's art collection includes works by Raphael, Botticelli and Poussin, and hundreds of paintings, sculptures and tapestries of hunting scenes. Chantilly forest was once the hunting ground of France's elite - now it is crisscrossed with bridleways and cycle paths and open to everyone, and Chantilly is more famous for horseracing. Its racecourse has to be one of the most beautiful anywhere in the world, with the chateau as a back drop, and the 18th-century Grand Ecuries (stables) along one side. </p> <p>There was no racing while we were there (the two most famous events, the Diane Herm\u00e8s and the Jockey Club, are held in June) so we did the next best thing and visited the Living Horse Museum. Unless you're an avid fan of all things equestrian, the displays will have limited appeal, but it's worth the \u20ac8 entrance just to admire the 186m-long stables with their original wooden horse boxes and 28m-high central dome. </p> <p>Just two miles outside Chantilly is another chateau-hotel, Montvillargenne. Commissioned by Baroness Jeanne of the Rothschilde family just before the first world war, it was occupied by the German army in the second world war and bombed by allied forces. Behind the grand exterior are 120 rooms, a pool, gym, bar and numerous meeting rooms (it's popular with incentive groups, so try to stay at the weekend). As with Mont Royal, you have to choose your room carefully - the ones of the fourth floor are a little pokey and you can only see out of the window if you stand on tiptoes. However, ours - room number 226 - had pale cream and eggshell-blue walls, and was big enough to hold a private party. Lolling about in the dressing gowns provided (\u20ac80 should you want to take one home), we felt suitably decadent. But with another gourmet meal awaiting us - this time at the hotel's Le Vilarg\u00e8ne restaurant - we didn't loll for long. On the second night Le Vilarg\u00e8ne was fully booked so, on the advice of the hotel, we went instead to La Renardi\u00e8re, a typical country restaurant five minutes away, and had the \u20ac32 four-course menu. By the time the cheese plate arrived my stomach was starting to hurt, and after the pear crumble and ice-cream, coffee and homemade petit fours, I felt like a fatted goose. </p> <p>Tempting as it was to swan around Montvillargenne like Lord and Lady So and So, we did venture out, first to Abbaye Royaumont, a vast abbey dating back to the 13th century and set in lovely grounds, then on to Auvers-sur-Oise, a small village whose claim to fame is La Maison de Van Gogh. </p> <p>This turned out to be not his house but the inn (Auberge Ravoux) where he spent his last days and where he died two days after shooting himself in a nearby field. He was 37. The half-hour tour of the inn takes in the tiny, bare room he rented for Ffr3.50 a day and a slideshow about his life. He was only there from May 20 to July 29 1890, but in that time produced over 70 paintings - including some of his most famous: The Church At Auvers (the church itself is a short walk from the inn); Portrait Of Dr Gachet; and The Wheatfields With Crows. He is buried at the cemetery above the church, next to his brother Theo, who died six months later. In a letter to Theo written on the day he arrived at Auvers the impoverished Van Gogh wrote: \"Auvers is quite beautiful, among other things a lot of old thatched roofs, which are getting rare. So I should hope that by settling down to do some canvases of this there would be a chance of recovering the expenses of my stay - for really it is profoundly beautiful, it is the real country, characteristic and picturesque.\" </p> <p>Driving back to Ch\u00e2teau Montvillargenne past golden fields of wheat, his words rang true - this part of France is still beautiful in a gentle, unassuming way - the difference now is that you can stay somewhere rather more grand than the Auberge Ravoux.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Sea France (08705 711711, <a href=\"http://www.seafrance.com\">seafrance.com</a>) offers two nights' B&amp;B at Ch\u00e2teau Mont Royal and two at Ch\u00e2teau Montvillargenne for \u00a3619 for two, including return Dover-Calais sea crossing. </p> <p><strong> Other chateaux hotels in Picardy:</strong> Ch\u00e2teau d'Ermenonville, Oise (+3 4454 0026, <a href=\"http://www.chateau-ermenonville.com\">chateau-ermenonville.com</a>), an 18th-century castle where Jean-Jacques Rousseau once lived.

  "<p>\u00b7 We spent six months in 2003 wending our way up the Andes from Santiago. We planned to theme our travel around rail travel and festivals, but found that there are precious few railways in South America, so we took buses instead. These were an education in themselves and ranged from those with stewards, three-course meals and DVDs in Argentina, to chicken buses full of dust with people sleeping in the aisles in Bolivia. We travelled on many overnight, because all the distances are huge compared to the UK and even the best scenery gets boring after six hours, and also because we saved a night's accommodation each time.</p> <p>The breathtaking bus route from Santiago to Mendoza in Argentina is one worth doing in the day. It follows a defunct narrow gauge line crossing the mountains beneath Aconcagua (highest Andean peak). There was no rail until far north-west Argentina, and the day trip on the Tren a las Nubes (Train of the clouds) from the friendly city of Salta.</p> <p>The vistas become ever more spectacular until the track reaches snowfields, climbing to over 5,000m. The ticket only takes you to the highest point on the Chilean/Argentine border, so half the day is spent going back the way you came. (You can alight at the end and negotiate with the Chilean freight train drivers to travel down the other side, but the trip involves freezing overnight in a coal wagon.)</p> <p>We bused from Salta up onto the high altiplano of Bolivia. Here you can take a train from Tupiza (where Butch Cassidy was shot down) to Ururo through harsh red desert landscapes and past gigantic salt flats full of rare James flamingos. This is a good alternative to touring the Salar de Uyuni for four days in a jeep - the only other way to see the wilds.</p> <p>The next train to be found is in Puno, on Lake Titicaca. We travelled to Puno on more buses, taking in Bolivia's capital La Paz. A train runs from Puno to the Quecha Indian city of Cuzco - unmissable not least because it's the best place to visit Machu Picchu from. If you do the typical four-day Inca trail, the journey back to Cuzco will be by vintage rail, or you could just take this lovely shiny blue locomotive down the Sacred Valley there and back again.</p> <p>Another train on the same line runs from nearby Juliaca down to Arequipa, the white mestizo city in the far south of Peru with a beautiful climate, overshadowed by three snowcapped volcanos.</p> <p>There are no trains then for the length of the Peruvian Andes, and flying to destinations will save a huge amount of time, since every road into the peaks is only B-road size and winds around an endless succession of hairpin bends. If you love the mountains, don't miss trekking in Huaraz.</p> <p>There are only three train journeys available in Ecuador: the spectacular Devil's Nose from Riobamba to Sibambe and back, a weekend excursion from Quito to the El Boliche station near Parque Nacional Cotopaxi and a 45km ride out of Ibarra. The first is the most famous, and follows a small part of the Andes up towards Quito. You can sit on the roof of this train, but hang on tight and wear enough clothes to combat the early morning chill.</p> <p>All the train journeys mentioned above only run every so often - Tren a las Nubes just runs twice a month and the Bolivian routes a couple of times a week.

However this journey can be done by land using public buses and some trains, but this does take a while.</p> <p>While in Chile you could hire a 4x4 and travel north to the border of Peru passing stretches of coast on one side and high Andes on the other. Once at the border of Peru and Chile you could take a bus to the colonial town of Arequipa, before heading into the Colca Canyon to view one of the deepest canyons in the world and spot the giant Condor's swooping above you. Before heading to Puno, on the shores of Lake Titicaca. The train from here will take you through the Andes to Cuzco, land of the Incas. A train journey can be taken from here up to Machu Picchu.</p> <p>Once back in Lima you could have the option of taking the world's highest train journey to Huancayo. The 12 hour journey will take you across mountains, through 66 tunnels, over 59 bridges and 22 zig zags. Back in Lima the bus journey is long to the border of Ecuador, although there are many options for amazing stops along the way.</p> <p>Once in Ecuador travel by bus to the colonial town of Cuenca, from here you can travel to Alausi to Riobamba on the famous Nariz del Diablo. Then travelling by road through the avenue of volcanoes back to Quito.</p> <p>If you would like more information please email me.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Christine@tripsworldwide.co.uk\"> Christine@tripsworldwide.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Crash Nitro Kart </strong><br>N-Gage</p> <p>Since the early-1990s reign of Mario and Sonic there have been several attempts at inventing the next big mascot.

Hamstrung by the N-Gage's narrow screen format and beset by a juddering frame rate and graphics that are at best rough around the edges, Nitro Kart is a work of staggering awfulness. The karts have no perceptible feel, circuits feature no memorable corners or cleverly concealed short- cuts and the whole thing feels shabby and slapped together.

The familiar hack-upenemies/ absorb-theirsouls gameplay returns, enhanced by Ako the fairy, who as well as allowing you to target enemies also acts as conduit between ancient Japanese Samanosuke and his modern day partner Jacques Blanc.

  "She is a giant of literature and symbol of free speech, a writer who stayed in South Africa during apartheid to fight for liberation by chronicling human relations under an evil system. Her novels earned a Nobel prize and a reputation as the symbol of restless white conscience. <p>But yesterday Nadine Gordimer stood accused of censorship and hypocrisy by killing what would be the first biography about her, because passages suggested a tart tongue and bitterness about colleagues. </p> <p>Ronald Suresh Roberts told the Guardian he was shaken by how a subject he revered turned on him after a seven-year collaboration intended to produce a sympathetic biography of her life and work. </p> <p>The 80-year-old's objections led to publishers in the United States and Britain dumping the manuscript. \"She is supposed to represent freedom of speech but she wanted complete control, tsar-like, which would have turned the manuscript into pious crap.\" </p> <p>He supplied letters from Bloomsbury Publishing in London and the New York-based Farrar, Straus and Giroux which lavished praise on his book but made publication conditional on the approval of Ms Gordimer, whose novels and short story collections they publish. </p> <p>Both publishers dropped the biography after she objected. </p> <p>Mr Roberts said the Nobel laureate objected to his quoting a letter from the 60s in which she revealed disdain for Ruth First, a fellow anti-apartheid activist who was subsequently assassinated by a letter bomb. </p> <p>\"I keep thinking of points to score off the silly bitch,\" the letter allegedly said. </p> <p>The biographer also said she was unhappy that he mentioned her feelings about the apparent failure of another writer, Doris Lessing, to congratulate her on the Nobel: \"I suspect she thought it didn't seem sufficiently Olympian.\" In fact Ms Lessing had congratulated her but the letter had been mislaid. </p> <p>Mr Roberts, a Trinidad-born writer based in Cape Town, said a close relationship which included lengthy interviews and full access to archives soured when Ms Gordimer read the manuscript last year and instructed editors in New York and London to amend it. \"I thought she would rise above the occasional discomfort in the manuscript. But it was weird vanity stuff she objected to.\" </p> <p>Contacted by phone at her house in Johannesburg, Ms Gordimer declined to respond to the allegations. \"I really can't comment on it. I've nothing to say. It's a private matter.\" </p> <p>The author of July's People and Burger's Daughter is celebrated for nuanced dissections of human nature but seldom discusses her private life. </p> <p>Her children live abroad and her husband died in 2001, leaving her alone in a house designed by the Victorian architect Sir Herbert Baker. </p> <p>She told the Guardian last year the biography would be authorised if she liked the final draft. \"My idea of biography is concentration on the work, not whether [the subject] eats eggs for breakfast, or if he's a good lover or not.\" </p> <p>Mr Roberts said the 700-page tome did focus on her work and was a positive portrait of a literary master. He showed a faxed letter from Ms Gordimer's daughter, Oriane, which called the manuscript \"very, very interesting and a joy to read\". </p> <p>A letter from the New York editor, Jonathan Galassi, said he was favourably impressed with its sensitivity, style and insight. \"I don't know anything of her reaction yet, but my own hunch is that she too - once she absorbs the shocks that being written about so intently must give rise to - will ... be glad about what you have done.\" </p> <p>After learning his hunch was wrong Mr Galassi wrote again to say the manuscript was \"in the shallows with no sense of the actual current\" and needed extensive rewriting. He was unavailable for comment yesterday. </p> <p>In a letter last month Liz Calder, a publisher at Bloomsbury, said the biography was in many ways a brilliant book. \"For Bloomsbury, however, it is not a publishing proposition, given the fact that it no longer has the authorisation of Nadine Gordimer. I am very sorry about this but I am sure you will understand the problem for Nadine Gordimer's own publishers.\" </p> <p>In a statement yesterday Ms Calder said the contract was for an authorised life of their star writer, and that it was no longer authorised. </p> <p>Books by Ms Gordimer, whose routine is to write from 9am to lunchtime on a portable typewriter, sell better abroad than at home and she remains one of the world's most prestigious novelists. </p> <p>Mr Roberts claimed the publishers succumbed to \"Faustian leverage\" from a woman who made her name speaking out: \"It's a perverse irony; it's beyond hypocrisy.\" </p> <p>Titled No Cold Kitchen, a pun on the subject's ability to withstand critical or political heat, the book will be published in South Africa early next year but Mr Roberts said he had yet to find new publishers in the US and Britain.</p> <p><b>South Africa's literary giant</b></p> <p>Nadine Gordimer, the daughter of Isidore and Nan Gordimer, was born on November 20 1923 in Springs, South Africa.

  "<p><strong>Saturday August 7</strong></p> <p> <strong>A River Runs Through It</strong> <br> (Robert Redford, 1992) <br>2.55pm, Five</p> <p>Charming story of brothers growing up in 1920s Montana: Craig Sheffer's well-behaved academic, Brad Pitt a gloomy reporter with a drink problem. Tom Skerritt is their fisher-father, taking them on tranquil river sojourns as troubles pile up. Skilfully, quietly directed by Redford.</p> <p> <strong>Devdas</strong> <br> (Sanjay Leela Bhansali, 2002) <br>3.40pm, C4</p> <p>C4's Bollywood season starts with a week-long tribute to Indian star Shah Rukh Khan, beginning with this lavish doomed love affair, featuring Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit. Part two is on tomorrow at 3.30pm, with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (tonight) and Chalte Chalte (tomorrow), and documentary The Inner World Of Shah Rukh Khan (Tuesday). RV </p> <p> <strong>Batman</strong> <br> (Leslie H Martinson, 1966) <br>5.15pm, Five</p> <p>Biff! Bang! Pow! Catwoman, The Riddler, The Joker and The Penguin team up to take on the dynamic duo in this feature-length version of the camp crusader. A psychedelic m\u00e9lange of on-screen cartoon exclamations, gloriously ridiculous effects and great dialogue that's a long way from Bob Kane's original dark knight, Adam West and Burt Ward are still for many the definitive Bat-dudes. Where else can you see the Batusi, a rubber shark and men in tights? RV </p> <p> <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong> <br> (Quentin Tarantino, 1994) <br>9.10pm, BBC2</p> <p>More black-suited crooks and killers from Tarantino: this follow-up to his stunning debut, Reservoir Dogs, is just as savagely amoral, but funnier. It takes three staples of the thriller genre - the gangster and the boss's wife; the pug's one last chance; the lovers' doomed heist - and interweaves them with giddy pace and complexity. With Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and a soundtrack to die for.</p> <p> <strong>The Shawshank Redemption</strong> <br> (Frank Darabont, 1994) <br>9.10pm, C4</p> <p>Adapted from a non-horror Stephen King story, Darabont's first film contains all the clich\u00e9s of jailbait drama but breaks free to create a richly emotive tale of male comradeship. Tim Robbins is accountant Andy Defresne, convicted of wife-murder in the 1940s, despite protesting his innocence; Morgan Freeman is Red, the fixer, who gradually befriends him at the bestial Shawshank State Prison. Beautifully acted, and crafted in fine detail by Darabont, all the way to the unlikely denouement.</p> <p> <strong>Unbreakable</strong> <br> (M Night Shyamalan, 2000) <br>10.15pm, ITV1</p> <p>Another high-class supernatural tale from the director of Signs and The Sixth Sense. Bruce Willis plays David Dunne, who miraculously survives a devastating train crash: according to weird, brittle-boned mystic Elijah (Samuel L Jackson) he is a bona fide, evil-fighting, comic-book superhero, heavily disguised as Joe Average. A slightly rambling tale with a silly ending, but along the way it's pretty gripping. Director M Night Shyamalan introduces the film at 10.10pm.</p> <p> <strong>Red Heat</strong> <br> (Walter Hill, 1988) <br>11pm, BBC1</p> <p>Hill does his bit for glasnost with a typically crunching action tale that brings Arnold Schwarzenegger's Moscow cop to Chicago, on the trail of beastly drug dealer Viktor (Ed O'Ross). Arnie normally does these things alone, but here is joined by local cop James Belushi in an entertaining but not exactly intellectual crime-busting tag-team.</p> <p> <strong>The Boston Strangler</strong> <br> (Richard Fleischer, 1968) <br>11.35pm, BBC2</p> <p>Harrowing, low-key dramatisation of the serial killer's reign of terror in Boston in the early 1960s. In its low-key, detailed approach it looks like an American cousin to the director's other evocative study of a real-life murderer, Christie, in 10 Rillington Place. To play the Strangler, Tony Curtis transformed his pretty boy looks and was never better; Henry Fonda leads the police hunt; Sally Kellerman is among the victims.</p> <p> <strong>Sunday August 8</strong> </p> <p> <strong>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</strong> <br> (William Shatner, 1989) <br>1.35pm, BBC1</p> <p>Shatner boldly goes where he's never gone before, and displays a talent for direction several warp factors short of even his modest acting skills. The aged and paunchy crew of the Enterprise are trying to sort out a little galactic calamity sparked by a character called Sybok, the Vulcan mystic, but find themselves knocking on heaven's door for a meeting with God himself. Everyone acts as though they've set their phasers on stunned. </p> <p> <strong>Smokey And The Bandit</strong> <br> (Hal Needham, 1977) <br>5pm, ITV1</p> <p>If you ever wondered why Citizen's Band radio, bushy moustaches and the Dukes Of Hazzard became so popular in the early 1980s, this is the reason why. Directed by former stuntman Needham, it's a car-action comedy caper which rarely leaves the road, and Burt \"Bandit\" Reynolds' black Trans-Am in particular. On an illicit beer run with his mate Cledus, he picks up runaway bride Sally Field, and it's big trucks, flying police cars and furious banjo music all the way home. SR </p> <p> <strong>She's All That</strong> <br> (Robert Iscove, 1999) <br>10pm, C4</p> <p>Diverting romantic comedy that just about overcomes its formulaic plot with some bright, zesty performances. Freddie Prinze Jr stars as high school hero Zack, who bets friends he can turn even the most unlikely girl into a prom queen. Enter Rachael Leigh Cook's scary Laney Boggs to test his skills to the limit - sort of, as she's obviously a Hollywood beauty underneath.</p> <p> <strong>The Sweet Hereafter</strong> <br> (Atom Egoyan, 1997) <br>11.35pm, BBC2</p> <p>Adapted from Russell Banks's novel, this is a sensitive and affecting portrait of communal grief. Ian Holm stars as a lawyer trying to drum up compensation business in a small, remote Canadian town where all but one of the children has been killed in a schoolbus accident. A quiet, beautifully acted drama.</p> <p> <strong>Monday August 9</strong> </p> <p> <strong>That Riviera Touch</strong> <br> (Cliff Owen, 1966) <br>1pm, BBC2</p> <p>Doesn't quite do justice to the telly-brilliance of Morecambe and Wise, but it's as close as they got in three big-screen attempts. When Eric and Ernie are sacked they decide to blow Eric's savings on a tour of southern France, where they are quickly embroiled with the local gangsters.</p> <p> <strong>Tuesday August 10</strong> </p> <p> <strong>Lucky Jim</strong> <br> (John Boulting, 1957) <br>1.10pm, BBC2</p> <p>Boulting brothers comedy based on Kingsley Amis's immensely popular satirical novel. Little satire here, though: the casting of Ian Carmichael as the eponymous hero points to the broadly farcical intent. The angry young university lecturer Jim Dixon is invited to the house of pompous professor Hugh Griffith for the weekend, where he is acutely accident-prone.</p> <p> <strong>Vanishing Point</strong> <br> (Richard C Sarafian, 1971) <br>11.05pm, ITV1</p> <p>Cult road movie with Barry Newman the grim-faced, amphetamine-fuelled Kowalski, an ex-racing driver, ex-cop, who drives 1,500 miles from San Francisco to Denver, then bets he can drive the return journey in 15 hours. Blind DJ Cleavon Little, hooked into police radio channels, helps him evade the cops who couldn't catch his supercharged Dodge Challenger anyway. A film driven with existential finesse.</p> <p> <strong>We're No Angels</strong> <br> (Neil Jordan, 1989) <br>11.35pm, BBC1</p> <p>Jordan finds a light touch in this American jaunt. There's an arresting teaming of Robert De Niro and Sean Penn as runaway cons posing as monks to make their escape into Canada, and David Mamet wrote the witty screenplay.</p> <p> <strong>Wednesday August 11</strong> </p> <p> <strong>The Edge</strong> <br> (Lee Tamahori, 1997) <br>11pm, ITV1</p> <p>Billionaire Anthony Hopkins accompanies his supermodel wife (Elle Macpherson) on a shoot in Alaska, where a plane crash pitches him, photographer Alec Baldwin and assistant Harold Perrineau into a fight for survival in the wilderness. Luckily, Hopkins has just been reading a book called Lost In The Wild, which is full of handy tips.</p> <p> <strong>JFK</strong> <br> (Oliver Stone, 1991) <br>11.05pm, BBC1</p> <p>Stone's long and gruelling investigation into the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963 ripped up the Warren Commission findings and made a hero of New Orleans prosecutor Jim Garrison. This fearless confronting of the great conspiracy needs a less hysterical, more measured, treatment; but even so, Stone's sheer cinematic verve makes a meaty movie.</p> <p><strong>Kandahar</strong> <br> (Mohsen Makhmalbaf, 2001) <br>11.50pm, BBC2</p> <p>You couldn't quite call this the real deal on Taliban-era Afghanistan, but it was just about the only place to turn when, post-9/11, everyone from George W Bush down was trying to understand what was going on there. Being a poetic Iranian director, Makhmalbaf opts for a simple desert travelogue which is based on the true story of a woman trying to find her sister in Afghanistan. This really is \"journey not destination\" territory. SR </p> <p> <strong>Thursday August 12</strong> <br></p> <p><strong>Fort Apache, The Bronx</strong> <br> (Daniel Petrie, 1980) <br>10.05pm, Five</p> <p>An awkward, flawed attempt to portray the working life of a Bronx police station: it's meant to be the real thing but mainly looks like a rerun of Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 13. It's a pity because there are strong, low-key performances from Paul Newman and Danny Aiello, Newman playing a hard-nosed cop who puts his career on the line to expose colleague Aiello as a murderer.</p> <p> <strong>Divided We Fall</strong> <br> (Jan Hrebejk, 2000) <br>11.20pm, BBC2</p> <p>Superior and well-judged black comedy that does a lot with its modest premise. It's wartime Czechoslovakia, and a childless couple secretly harbour a Jewish refugee. To deflect suspicion, they must go to increasingly absurd lengths, like placating the local Nazi, who has designs on the wife. SR </p> <p> <strong>Friday August 13</strong> </p> <p> <strong>Days Of Thunder</strong> <br> (Tony Scott, 1990) <br>11.05pm, BBC1</p> <p>Tony Scott and Tom Cruise tried to recreate their Top Gun success here, replacing fast jets with fast cars, and Nicole Kidman with Kelly McGillis in the formula. For a movie with such speedy vehicles, it's pretty slow. RV </p> <p> <strong>Vampire Circus</strong> <br> (Robert Young, 1971) <br> 12.50pm, BBC1</p> <p>The circus arrives in a remote 19th century Serbian village, its nightly magic an antidote to the onslaught of the plague, which has also appeared out of nowhere. For a time debut-director Young, aided by an exceptional performance from Adrienne Corri, crafts a fairy-tale world like something out of Angela Carter's The Company Of Wolves but the illusion isn't sustained and finally gives way to a welter of traditional Hammer horrors.</p> <p> <strong>The Doom Generation</strong> <br> (Gregg Araki, 1995) <br>1.45am, C4</p> <p>One of the wilder road movies, this, with middle-class teenage lovers Rose McGowan and James Duval picking up Johnathon Schaech's hitchhiker from hell and launching into a nightmarish American odyssey. The gruesome murder of a store assistant sets the tone nicely. Full of hard sex and violence, it's rather further down the highway than Natural Born Killers.</p>",
  "<p>\"Sit still - there, got it!\" says Errol Douglas, triumphantly removing a grey hair from my head and presenting it to me with a flourish, sending me into a state of open-mouthed shock. That was more than six months ago, and while I said last week that the main reason I hadn't been to the hairdresser's for so long was that I was enjoying being able to tie back my hair, I must also confess that the fear of Errol finding an entire family of grey definitely played a part, too. </p> <p>It wasn't the greyness of the hair that was so shocking - in fact, I think grey afro hair looks great (especially grey dreadlocks: just take a look at how they transformed Billy Ocean) - but rather that this particular grey hair, not to mention each one I have found since, has been straight. I don't mean a touch less curly than my regular hair; I mean so straight it makes Jude Law look a little camp. </p> <p>\"Grey hair bears no relation to your existing hair,\" Errol explains when I finally pluck up the courage to see him again. \"It's completely different hair, it has no pigment, hence the grey, and it can be a completely different texture from the hair you've had previously.\" </p> <p>According to tricologist Philip Kingsley, afro hair is thought to turn grey more slowly than Caucasian hair, which is something of a consolation, I guess, because it means my curls should be safe for a few years yet. </p> <p>But what about those who are tempted to cover up the grey from the comfort of their bathroom? \"Grey hair is not something I would recommend trying to cover with home colour kits,\" Errol warns. \"It's something that needs to be looked after professionally. Visiting a salon is a must, so that colour charts can be used to match hair colours with your skin and make-up. Discuss which colours you think suit you, and come to an agreement that both you and the stylist are happy with. For afro hair, I'd recommend dark browns and near black - actual black will look solid and unnatural.\" </p> <p>Incidentally, that advice applies as much to men as it does to women.</p>",

  "<p>Government will scrutinise the reform the Football Association has vowed to undertake after its bungled handling of the Svengate affair. </p> <p>Tessa Jowell, the secretary of state for sport, stopped short of calling for football's governing body to accept intervention, but her department will be keeping a close eye on developments. </p> <p>\"The question of administration is of course an internal matter,\" she said, \"but the FA's handling of what has happened recently is important in terms of public confidence in what is a major sport and a major business in this country. </p> <p>\"The millions of fans that support their teams have got to feel confident that the sport they feel passionate about and spend a large amount of their marginal income on is being properly governed. </p> <p>\"I don't believe that state regulation of sport or football is the answer but football does need to show that it has a leadership that recognises the importance of sorting this situation out.\" </p> <p>Those who are manoeuvring for greater influence at the FA will be encouraged by those comments and moves are afoot for the professional game to take a tighter rein on FA affairs. </p> <p>The appointment of the Premier League chairman Dave Richards and the chairman of the national game board Roger Burden as shepherds to the FA chairman Geoff Thompson is just the first step in attempts by the clubs to exercise greater control. </p> <p>Already members of the FA's main board - effectively the non-executive directors - have drawn up outline plans to separate the twin pillars of the modern game's governance, with commercial activity on the one side and regulation on the other. </p> <p>Though Thompson is highly regarded for his work in rebuilding the FA's reputation with Fifa and Uefa since the abortive World Cup 2006 bid, he has been held accountable for the misguided exoneration of the former chief executive Mark Palios. </p> <p>His influence has been deliberately eroded, with the board going as far as it could in the absence of an FA Council mandate to remove him. That Burden, a representative of the amateur game, should act as one of his minders might be interpreted as power sharing with Richards, whose background is in the professional game. </p> <p>However, Burden's sympathy with the free marketeers in professional football - he is understood to have been pivotal in unseating Palios's predecessor Adam Crozier - has sparked fears of the professionals' intentions. </p> <p>\"The PR disaster of recent weeks is not fundamentally connected to the governance structure of the FA,\" said Matthew Holt of the Football Governance Research Centre. \"The FA needs commercial activity to fund its regulatory and developmental objectives. The agenda appears to be about gaining control of the commercial activities of the FA corporate side and the England team.\" </p> <p>What is crucial, however, is filling the office of executive chairman of a restructured FA. Sir Trevor Brooking, director of football development, has been widely tipped to take such a role after impressing as chairman of Sport England. Jowell would appear to support such a promotion in principle, saying: \"Trevor Brooking clearly has a very important role to play in the game at the moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1896, a skinny Greek shepherd named Spiridon Louis won the inaugural Olympic marathon over, disputed legend has it, the same course taken by Pheidippides to carry news of a great victory by Greek underdogs (another one) in 490BC.</p> <p>Louis ran his epic on a dirt road. And, driving in his footsteps from Marathon to Athens only six weeks ago, one feared Paula Radcliffe might have to do the same when she lines up as clear favourite for Olympic gold on August 22. This may be the most historic route on the planet but, with the games almost upon us, it is also one long roadwork.</p> <p>\"It's a classic, all right,\" grumbles Panos Soulides, a resident of the route, as he makes his way home through a moonscape of gravel and rocks. \"A classic mess by the Olympic organisers.\"</p> <p>Their objective was simple enough: widen the narrow roadway along the 26.2-mile route to give the runners more elbow room and the TV cameras more space, then beautify what those cameras would show the world.</p> <p>But work on renovating the route started way behind schedule. Then, earlier this year, the main contractor admitted he could not afford to pay his workers. In February they blocked traffic to draw attention to their situation, causing massive jams. The contractor was sacked.</p> <p>Construction is now due to be completed just a few days before Radcliffe competes. Any failures to finish the road project will be impossible to hide. The work will snake alongside like a giant - and dirty - open wound.</p> <p>The marathon will start at 6pm, in temperatures likely to be in the high 80s (the athletes unsuccessfully campaigned for a 7.30am start). This, allied to the brutal nature of the course, means Radcliffe will have to temper the aggressive, from-the-gun style she has employed to such effect in her three previous marathons.</p> <p>While Radcliffe is confident she runs well in hot conditions, others have pointed out that the race's late start means pollution levels will be at their highest, aggravating her asthma.</p> <p>If anyone is capable of overcoming the odds, it is Radcliffe. But she could do worse than consult Coventry's Bill Adcocks, who in 1969 won the annual Athens marathon in 2hr 11min 7sec and has now written a book about the course. His time has withstood countless attacks by big-name runners over the past 35 years, and remains the course record going into the games.</p> <p>\"From 20km to 32km the course rises 650 feet,\" Adcocks explains. \"There are a lot of hills and some are very hard. Paula's not going to set a world record there. A time of 2hr 22min [seven minutes slower than her world record] would be phenomenal and hopefully still leave her clear of anyone else.\"</p> <p>Radcliffe could also profitably sit down for a chat with Nikos Polias. \"You have to start slowly,\" says the Greek, winner of the Marathon to Athens race six times in 11 starts. \"Because you still need to be alive when you get to 30km. You have to be very patient so you can take advantage of the last 10km, which drops down to the finish.\"</p> <p>Professor Tim Noakes, a South African whose book The Lore of Running is considered a classic on the subject, has extensively studied the hot, humid conditions the runners will face and believes they will count against Radcliffe. \"African athletes will be advantaged and in the marathon, the winner will probably come from a hot region,\" he predicts.</p> <p>Much of the marathon route is a hodgepodge of stately neoclassical buildings, tired 1960s-era apartment blocks, shops and McDonald's restaurants. To ensure the huge workforce completes its renovations, residents have had to live with a permanent dust cloud hanging over them.</p> <p>Shops have seen business suffer because customers could not negotiate the roadworks blocking their way. Many plan to launch compensation claims, including Yannis Katostarakias, owner of a petrol station that has not seen a customer for six months because the road beside it is closed.</p> <p>Meanwhile the mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyianni, has appealed to landlords to spruce up their buildings and trim the forest of TV aerials in an effort to improve the image of this most classical of routes.</p> <p>\"Be joyful, we win,\" Pheidippides was reported to have gasped before dropping dead of exhaustion. If she triumphs, Radcliffe will share his sentiment - but will continue running all the way to the bank and a cool \u00a35m windfall. For their part, the organisers will just heave a huge sigh of relief that their marathon is finally over. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Road to Athens, by Bill Adcocks, is published by Amrec69</p>",
  "<p><strong> Show stoppers </strong> <br></p> <p>The phrase \"men's C2 slalom\" may sound prosaic but the sight of two chaps kneeling perilously in a canoe, trying to manoeuvre backwards through narrow revolving doors in a raging torrent pouring down an unfriendly mountainside is anything but.

  "<p><strong> Brits to watch </strong> </p> <p>Kate Howey won a judo bronze in Barcelona 12 years ago, nothing in Atlanta and a silver in Sydney in 2000. Thirty-one is bus-pass age for a judo player but the lightweight battler from Andover can never be written off.</p> <p>Survivors from the eventing cross-country face a day of nail-biting in the show-jumping arena, where a moment's lapse at a crucial double can drop individuals and teams alike from hero to zero. If any three of the British quintet are still in contention, bettering Sydney's team silver medal is not out of the question.</p> <p>Ian Edmond is another breaststroker with medal credentials. The first Scot to eclipse David Wilkie's quarter-century-old times in the 200m, he won silver in last year's world championships, though the Japanese world record holder presents formidable opposition today. <br></p> <p><strong> Show stoppers </strong> <br> Cycling's finest road racers come into their own in the individual time-trial on the coastal strip south-east of Athens - no team help, no slipstreaming, just a lung- and leg-searing head-down, 30-mile slog against the clock. Lance Armstrong won't be there but Germany's Jan Ullrich will be and the word from the cognoscenti is that the \"Fat Boy\", who took silver in this event in Sydney as well as gold in the road race, will be the one to beat. <br></p> <p><strong> One for the purist </strong> <br> And we really mean purist this time. Athens goes all sentimental by starting the athletics programme two days early in the ancient games arena in Olympia, dragging a few diehards to an archaeological site with no spectator stands, plonking a shot-put circle amid the broken marble columns and deciding the men's and women's titles there. (Note to London's 2012 Olympic bid: how about the triple jump at Stonehenge?) <br></p> <p><strong> That's never a sport </strong> <br> Beach volleyball.

His dad then built him a shooting range on the family farm - so it's as well he didn't grow up in Peckham.  <strong> Street recognition rating </strong> 3/10 <br> He's the only one of the 11 British gold medallists from Sydney not to have appeared on A Question of Sport. \"Other Olympic champions have been on but I have never been asked,\" he sniffs.  <strong> Tabloid angle </strong> <br> On his school report the youngster's PE teacher pulled him up for \"bad hand-eye coordination\". \"He has never lived it down,\" Faulds says with a degree of triumphalism.  <strong> Speak for yourself </strong> <br> \"My coach and psychologist understand exactly what makes me tick - if I told you, I'd have to shoot you.\" Even worse, he'd fling you in the air in a giant arc first. <br></p> <p><strong> On range </strong> <br></p> <p><strong> Why shooting? </strong> \"It was a birthday present from Dad, shooting lessons,\" Faulds recalls. \"I'd come home from school and go straight to the shooting school two or three days a week.\" Now that's what we call an education. <br> <strong> Biggest win </strong> <br> Need we ask? After winning gold in Sydney, Faulds was overwhelmed. \"I cannot believe it. It's a dream come true - somebody smack me,\" he said, clutching a large shotgun. Nobody volunteered. <br> <strong> Expert view &lt;/ <br> Keith Fisher, deputy editor of Clay Shooting magazine: \"Richard has all the skills, experience and mental discipline to win again. As well as the shooting, he spends a lot of time preparing mentally. He has the killer instinct and will to win.\" <br> A detail too far </strong> <br> Faulds comes from the village of Longparish, once the home of Colonel Peter Hawker, who fought under Wellington and was the author of Instructions to Young Sportsmen in All That Relates to Guns and Shooting - published in 1814 and a definitive text in the sport, even if it is largely concerned with the slaughter of game birds.</p> <p><strong> Fellow gold hopes </strong> <br></p> <p>Look out for Sydney silver-medallist Ian Peel and Sarah Gibbins in the trap, and Michael Babb in the 50m rifle prone.</p> <p><strong> In Greek mythology he'd be ... </strong> <br></p> <p><strong> Paris </strong> The Trojan prince practised archery until he was good enough to hit Achilles' heel. Faulds is said to fire his Beretta 12-bore 1,500 times a day on his farm. And now he's embarking on a trip to Greece, where he hopes to carry off a glittering prize from under the noses of his hosts.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Who is she? </strong></p> <p><strong> Full name </strong> Georgina Claire Harland <br> <strong> Age </strong> 26 <br> <strong> World ranking </strong> 1 <br> <strong>Previous Olympics </strong> None <br></p> <p> <strong> Out of the arena </strong> <br></p> <p><strong> Humble roots </strong> <br> After her parents were given a horse called Ricky to look after, Harland's mind was made up. No, not a career in Eastenders; she joined the Pony Club aged eight, watched the opening of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and set her course: \"I wanted to come out in my hat behind the British flag.\" It was the hat that clinched it.  <strong> Street recognition rating </strong> 2/10 <br> Despite her No1 world ranking, she's still anonymous to all but schoolgirls who love horses and think boys are stupid.  <strong> Tabloid angle </strong> <br> Harland once persuaded a family friend to open the pool at King's School in Canterbury so she could train on Boxing Day. As the great man said: \"Dedication's what you need.\"  <strong> Speak for yourself </strong> <br> \"Once in a while you get a donkey,\" she says of the random draw for show-jumping horses. \"You just hope it's not at the Olympics.\" Still, as excuses for failure go, it's a lot better than, 'I wasn't trained hard enough.'</p> <p><strong> In the arena </strong> <br></p> <p><strong> Why the modern pentathlon? </strong> <br> As Harland found out, Britain's outstanding strength in depth is all down to the Pony Club's foresighted promotion of the \"tetrathlon\" (running, shooting, swimming and riding). Chuck in a bit of sword-fighting later and it's golds all round. <strong> Biggest win </strong> <br> In 2003 she was crowned European Champion and even stood on the top step of the Athens podium - having won a World Cup event there. This year she added gold in the team world championships with Kate Allenby. So the form book looks OK.  <strong> Expert view </strong> <br> Sydney gold medallist Stephanie Cook (they all have such wholesome first names): \"George has a phenomenal run and swim. If she performs to her potential she could be unbeatable.\"  <strong> A detail too far </strong> <br> Oxford University's Cowboy Cup is awarded annually to the student modern pentathlete who comes off their horse most often. A fall scores one point, an injury two, hospitalisation three. Last year's winner managed a mighty 10 points. <br></p> <p><strong> Fellow gold hope </strong> </p> <p>The aforementioned Ms Allenby, bronze medallist in Sydney and a very serious prospect herself.</p> <p> <strong> In Greek mythology she'd be ... </strong> <br> </p> <p><strong> Atalanta </strong> </p> <p>Atalanta was an excellent shot, a doughty fighter and famously fast on her feet. Harland shares those attributes, although she wasn't suckled by a she-bear. Atalanta lost an important race (for her heart) when she was distracted by gold, and later turned into a lion (take note, Sir Clive).</p>",
  "<p><strong> Show stoppers </strong> <br></p> <p>The first of two mornings of high expectancy, high tension and high blood pressure on the rowing lake includes the final of the men's four. Have Matthew Pinsent and the British team reinvented themselves well enough to repeat that Redgrave moment? While we're at it, can the women's pair of Cath Bishop and Kath Grainger throw off the mid-season doubts and fulfil their huge potential? If not, heads could roll so fast we'll be watching skulls as well as scullers. <br></p> <p><strong> Other Brits to watch </strong> <br></p> <p>In the velodrome Bradley Wiggins is our man in the old Chris Boardman slot, the 4,000 metres individual pursuit, and it's not only the British team who are tipping him for gold.</p> <p>All over in a flash and a shower of spray, the women's 50 metres freestyle is impossible to predict but the Commonwealth gold medallist Alison Shepherd - almost incredibly competing in her fifth Olympics - could well be there among the contenders.</p> <p>And a hockey group game pits Great Britain against Germany, a rerun of the glorious 1988 final in Seoul. <br></p> <p><strong> One for the purist </strong> <br></p> <p>Since the NBA millionaires' entry into the Games in 1992, USA's basketball team have won every game they have contested. But in the Sydney semi they came so close to defeat by Lithuania that back home they were preparing an Italian-style, fruit-based welcome.

  "<p><strong> Show stoppers </strong> <br></p> <p>The head says that Berhane Adere, the aggressive, long-striding Ethiopian with the blistering finish and a hatful of victories on road and track to her name, is a shoo-in for the women's 10,000m. The heart whispers that Paula Radcliffe, euphoric (or furious) after the marathon last weekend, will put in an appearance at the start line and run the legs off Adere. Stranger things have happened.</p> <p>There's also the potential culmination of the great Marion Jones Olympic saga, if it hasn't culminated already by now.</p> <p><strong> Other Brits to watch </strong> <br></p> <p>Spare a thought for Georgina Harland. Ever since the Sydney champion Stephanie Cook anointed her as the new keeper of the modern pentathlon flame, she has been pencilled in for Athens gold. But it needs only a stroppy horse in the riding section, or a touch of the wobbles on the pistol range, and everything could go pear-shaped. Sydney bronze-medallist Kate Allenby will be poised for just such an eventuality.</p> <p>It's relay time: semi-finals today for the 4x100m men's team (who have a horrible habit of messing things up at this stage) and the women's 4x400m squad. Britain has not won an Olympic relay gold medal for 68 years, so it's time something went right.</p> <p><strong> One for the purist </strong> <br></p> <p>Two highly experienced British riders, Nick Skelton and Robert Smith, would hope to be up at the sharp end in the individual show-jumping finals today.

At four o'clock this afternoon close the curtains, switch off Test Match Special and watch Paula Radcliffe make her head-bobbing bid for Britain's first ever Olympic long-distance running title. It's in the oppressive heat of an Athens evening (thanks to the demands of US television) and the first 20 miles are generally uphill (thanks to that runner who hustled from Marathon to the capital in 490BC), but it's the same for them all, and at her best Paula is simply the best. <br></p> <p><strong> Other Brits to watch </strong> <br></p> <p>Look out for the baby of the British cycling team, Vicky Pendleton, in the cat-and-mouse complexities of the women's sprint.

Their predecessors were delighted with a silver in Sydney. This year's crew could go one better.</p> <p>If any or all of Britain's 100m sprinting trio of Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell and Mark Lewis-Francis have made it through to the last 16, today they get their chance to earn a place in the final.

If it hasn't already happened - and the player herself was optimistic about her chances here - today's women's doubles final will see Martina Navratilova complete the very last point in her very last game in any serious tournament anywhere.

But really the spectacle's the thing ... and the very faint chance that someone might breach the strict rule against \"any form of public nudity\" in the transition areas. </p> <p>Talking of public nudity, back in 1996 a member of the victorious US women's football squad fulfilled a rash pre-tournament promise by running down a street in Athens, Georgia, wearing only her gold medal.

They were greeted at the airport by the youth and sports minister Ravi Yerrigadoo before receptions with the president Cassam Uteem and the prime minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth. Each athlete received \u00a32,000 from the government in appreciation of the honour they had brought to the country. </p> <p>Buckland is now ranked No1 in the world and in the world championships in Paris last year he missed out on a bronze medal by only 0.03sec. </p> <p><strong> Stanislavs Olijars</strong><br> Latvia, 110m hurdles </p> <p>WR: 12.91sec, Colin Jackson (GB), 1993 </p> <p>OR: 12.95sec, Allen Johnson (US), Atlanta, 1996 </p> <p> Stanislavs Olijars' achievements on the track have made him extremely popular in Latvia and in 2002 he was voted sportsperson of the year in the Latvian newspaper Sports. </p> <p>His personal best in the 110m hurdles is 13.08sec and last year only Allen Johnson was ranked higher. A gold medal may be within his reach in Athens. </p> <p>\"My first aim is to get into the final, where I hope to run under 13 seconds,\" said Olijars. </p> <p>The 25-year-old is coached by his parents. His mother, Ludmila, won the national 100m hurdles championship 11 times and his stepfather Aleksandrs Cumakovs was one of the best 400m hurdlers in Russia.

We also go out practising in our Star boat here in Bermuda.\" </p> <p><strong> William Chetcuti</strong><br> Malta, clay shooting (double trap)<br> At the age of 16 William Chetcuti was shooting for Malta. His contribution to sport in his homeland has already been recognised by the Malta Olympic Committee, which has voted him Maltese athlete of the year for the past two years. In 2002 he won bronze in the Commonwealth Games and took silver in the European championships. </p> <p>Now 19, he is ranked in the top 20 in Europe and set a world junior record in the double trap when he hit 146 out of 150. </p> <p>He is optimistic that he can win a medal in Athens. \"I have competed with these guys many times and at similar high-level competitions so I know I have a good chance,\" he said. </p> <p><strong> Dion Crabbe</strong><br> British Virgin Islands, 100m and 200m </p> <p> When Dion Crabbe won the 100m in the Central American and Caribbean Games in December 2002 - the British Virgin Islands' first gold in a major championship - he was congratulated by the chief minister Ralph O'Neal, who said: \"Your record-making feat will certainly not be forgotten as it is indelibly etched in our minds and certainly in the history books of the territory and the region. </p> <p>\"You have always been an ambassador for the country but now you have made the BVI's name even greater in the athletic world.\" </p> <p>Crabbe's success led to television appearances and a local phone company produced a phone card carrying his picture. He has set BVI records of 10.25sec in the 100 and 20.30 in the 200. </p> <p><strong> Frankie Fredericks</strong><br> Namibia, 100m </p> <p> When Frankie Fredericks became Namibia's first Olympic medallist after finishing second in both the 100m and 200m in Barcelona in 1992 he was greeted by an euphoric nation and an embrace from the president. He also had a street named after him in the capital, Windhoek. </p> <p>He has become a role model in a country where an estimated 56% of the population live on less than \u00a31.10 a day. </p> <p>Fredericks, 36 years old, sees the Olympics as his last chance of winning the one gold medal that has eluded him, having again finished second in both runs in the 1996 Atlanta games. Injury kept him out of the 2000 games in Sydney. </p> <p>He plans to continue representing his country after he retires, possibly as an ambassador. </p> <p> \"I have been serving, giving my time to Namibia for the last 14 years,\" he said. \"If the next president of this country feels that I am capable, it would be a continuation of what I am doing now.\" </p> <p><strong> Sam Pera</strong><br> Cook Islands, weightlifting (105kg) </p> <p>WR: 440kg </p> <p>OR: 427.5kg </p> <p> Sam Pera, who will be one of only three people competing for the Cook Islands in Athens, began his weightlifting career in 1992. </p> <p>He has been named sportsman of the year four times in the Cook Islands. Although he was national weightlifting champion for five years in succession, he was forced to retire from the sport in 1996 after losing his job. </p> <p>He returned to weightlifting in 2002 and finished fifth in the Commonwealth Games in Manchester that year. The 35-year-old father of four combines his training with work as a gardener. </p> <p>Pera's son, Sam Pera Jnr, is following in his father's footsteps, having finished fourth in the 94kg category in the Oceania junior championships in May.</p>",

But, as a woman, is likely to suffer increased bone demineralisation, putting her at greater risk of brittle bones in later life. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>She's got close-set eyes and pointed features, what I call \"flying wedge energy\": she attacks things and goes for it. Her exposed eyelids give her quick reactions, and those two small mounds on her forehead are signs of an incredible imagination. She will already have visualised herself with her gold medal. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>There's definitely something about her. The eyes, the brain... But there's also a touch of Julie Andrews Syndrome. Her deal with nicey-nicey Cadbury's sums it up: fit but square. Tell us what you really think, Paula! Then we can get Gucci on the phone - big bucks. Or Agent Provocateur? \u00a325m <br></p> <p><strong> LeBron James </strong> (US) <br> Basketball Age 19 Golds 0 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>I suppose it's great that the games have the likes of this multi-millionaire American superstar competing and it's great that LeBron James wants to win a gold medal. Having said that, I really think the Olympics should be the highest pinnacle in your sport - and for basketball, they're not. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>Very young and rich, LeBron might find it hard to settle. He may be confused about where he is, although, given his upbringing (he moved repeatedly as his mother sought work), he can surely cope. My worry is, given his age, if he hasn't built a circle of friends in the first week he could have problems. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>His height would be a major problem in the cramped conditions of a spacecraft, as would his high calorific intake on the almost three-year trip to and from Mars. Coupled with the fact that a ball bouncing on board will not be damped by gravity, James is likely to find a trip to Mars very disorienting. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>He's also got exposed eyelids, showing the speed of his reactions - don't think, act. Rounded ears, too, so he'll flow on court. He sees the whole play but will get impatient when things aren't going well. He talks non-stop and likes to look good. He's probably got a huge wardrobe. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>\"Who he?\" used to be the British response to the huge figures of basketball. But so popular is the sport now that LeBron is already a global star (ask your local comprehensive). As the youngest NBA rookie of the year with a $90m five-year Nike deal, Olympic gold will be academic. Boo. \u00a3200m <br></p> <p><strong> Carolina Kluft </strong> (Swe) <br> Heptathlon Age 21 Golds 0 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>Kluft has been outstanding and Denise ( Lewis, Britain's defending champion) will find it very tough. Denise has been there before, she knows what it's all about and sometimes it's easier to come from behind. But most favourites win - and Kluft is the strong favourite. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>Being the house's one young woman will hold her in good stead, provoking protective impulses in the older women and the men. Her pacifying effect should see her avoid early nomination. Personality will also work in her favour: she's very down to earth, though her athletic success points to an iron will. </p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>As the only multi-skilled athlete, she's an excellent choice to be an astronaut. She's likely to have more effective inter-relationship skills than the men and, like all women, would multi-task very effectively. Her highly developed eye-body coordination makes her a natural to pilot the mission. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Her facial combination is often seen in pro golfers - she has all the competitive traits and is very direct. Her forehead is more linear, suggesting she takes things step by step. Sharp features show she likes to get under the surface, but fine hair means she's sensitive to her feelings being hurt. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Marketing isn't all about image; a real personality helps too. And Kluft has it in spades, so Swedish TV has its anchorwoman until 2060. But can you take the girl out of Stockholm? Come to Britain, Caz. We love a bit of Swede. \u00a310m <br></p> <p><strong> Matthew Pinsent </strong> (GB) <br> Rowing Age 33 Golds 3 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>This four have had their setbacks but they are still seriously good. Matthew and James (Cracknell); won the world championships in 1999 and Ed Coode won the same race in the same boat two years later with Steve Williams. Don't be surprised if they walk away with the gold medal. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>Having lost his other half, he might be better suited to Big Brother than anyone. He's used to working in a team, so should integrate well. But, if he sees this as a chance to prove himself, he may come unstuck. He's intelligent and, even better, has already done TV work. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>High level of stamina would be of great benefit, and is unlikely to suffer disorientation, given his experience of facing in the opposite direction of travel. But may become frustrated by lack of unfrozen water on Mars. Unlike others, could continue to practise his sport almost unaffected by zero-gravity. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>He'd be an excellent coach. He's got two deep lines between his eyebrows, which show his dedication and precision. He's trained to get things right and he's very tenacious. He's also very analytical, which helps in his racing. He enjoys working with people and with information. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Ah, the Olympics. Must be time for rowing then. It used to be right down there with rugby; now it's out on its own. It's just not the same without Redgrave, is it? Sorry Matt, there's only a few million in it for you. \u00a33m <br></p> <p><strong> Maurice Greene (US) </strong> <br> 100m Age 30 Golds 2 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>I've caught a few of the sprint races this year and it seems to be a very mixed bunch. There's nobody really standing out, so Maurice has to be at the top end of that group because of what he's done before. He's been there and done that and knows what it's all about. </p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos <br> This is all about TV wannabes. Has been through a lot in his life but that experience may not benefit him in the house. Like many who find success relatively late, he could be protective of that status and come across as arrogant. As a competitor in the ultimate individual event, he might not be a team player. I can't see him achieving much. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>Noted for explosive power due to his strong muscular development, zero-gravity would cause significant wasting to occur. Psychologically, as a sprinter who survives on his nerves, Greene wouldn't be suited to space, where everything is pre-planned to minimise the risk of catastrophe. </p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Like many athletes, his head is wide at the back and narrow at the front, showing a highly competitive personality. His Greek-shaped nose means he's good with money, while his wide face mirrors his self-confidence. No challenge is too big for him - he's a born athlete <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>The GOAT gets nil points for stealing his acronym from the real 'greatest of all time', but Big Mo looks set to fulfil his boasts of more gold. Then he can trouser another few million off Adidas and top that up with motivational seminars in Japan. But can you really be heroic with a name like Maurice? \u00a330m <br></p> <p><strong> Martina Navratilova </strong> (US) <br> Tennis Age 47 Golds 0 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>Despite Navratilova being the ultimate tennis veteran, this will be her first Olympics. I'm not sure if she's going to win the women's doubles gold (with Lisa Raymond), but she will definitely enjoy the experience. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>The most political housemate. Extremely intelligent, she's also never afraid to speak her mind. She needs a competitive edge in her life but must realise Big Brother is a game not a sport. By the time she works that out it may be too late. A wonderful competitor, but this is not the right format for her. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>As any crew is likely to be multinational, knowledge of east European languages is a great asset. But demand for perfection in herself and others might test interpersonal relationships, while as a leftie she'd find many activities difficult in space as they are ergonomically designed for right-handers. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Close-set eyes and low-set ears: she has high standards and expects the same from others. Her sloping forehead means she's very analytical. The convex nose says she likes to be the boss - you'll see that in her choice of doubles partners. But she's got fine hair, so she's also very sensitive and caring. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>When Martina came out the brands stayed indoors. But that was then. A gold medal now might bring a few more Subaru ads in the States. Trouble is, she's getting on a bit and, frankly, can be a little bit scary. Especially when compared to the new Wimbledon ladies' champion. \u00a321m. <br></p> <p><strong> Haile Gebrselassie </strong> (Eth) <br> 10,000m Age 31 Golds 2 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>If you go into the games as reigning champion, and the Olympics is the pinnacle of what you do, a lot depends on how you deal with that pressure. Gebrselassie is hugely experienced but he's also going to be under huge pressure from his brilliant young compatriot, Kenenisa Bekele. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>I expect him to do very well. He's going into politics when he hangs up his spikes, hinting at a heightened understanding of people. From a poor background he's achieved startling success but he's not in-your-face and won't ignite situations like younger men. Someone with substance. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>Not the stereotypical image of an astronaut but his very efficient use of calories and low body mass make him an attractive choice from a logistics perspective. The solitary nature of his sport, though, raises questions about his ability to interact in this team-oriented and intimate environment. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>The square chin means he's a fighter. He'll go beyond the threshold of most people. He's got a square forehead too, which shows he tends to let work become his hobby. His forehead is very flat, indicating a thinking personality. He's not a people person, not as openly friendly as Maurice Greene. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Boy from the third world makes good. Heart-warming stuff or patronising claptrap? You decide - because Disney are turning his life story into a film. Will the ending be re-shot after Athens? Does he own the merchandising rights? Start queuing now. \u00a320m <br></p> <p><strong> Marion Jones (US) </strong> <br> Long jump Age 28 Golds 3 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>If there's any evidence that Marion Jones has been cheating then she shouldn't be competing (her appearance in Athens is in question). It's nice finally to see some of the athletes putting their hands up and, if only under duress, admitting they have been cheating. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>A housemate who can't be trusted rarely stays for long, and she's got major trust issues - especially with men. Two high-profile relationships have both run into difficulties, and she's got drug problems to boot. She may even be barred from the house before the programme begins. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>She is likely to find the trip to Mars very difficult: accustomed to explosive activities such as the long jump, her body will suffer from muscle atrophy and bone thinning. But on reaching Mars, with gravity less than half that on Earth, at least she'll find it easy to increase her personal best. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Oval eyebrows suggest her thoughts are very organised. Her square jaw-line hints at a natural inclination towards authority: she doesn't like being told what to do. Her pronounced cheek bones mean she likes to explore new ideas but her upturned nose implies she is very trusting - almost naive. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Oh dear. Brands can go down as well as up - and it's not looking good for Ms Jones. Her 'white moustache' milk ad might turn out to have been the highlight. Bank the cash now. \u00a314m</p>",
  "<p><strong> Tracey Morris <br> Contact lens optician and marathon runner </strong> <br></p> <p>By the time Tracey Morris sees her first patient of the day at the Albion Street branch of Dolland and Aitchison opticians in Leeds, she has often run farther than many commuters drive to work. Up at 5.30am she runs \"usually between five and eight miles\", showers, grabs some breakfast and still makes it from her home in the suburb of Alwoodley to work in the city centre with time to spare.</p> <p>\"I usually have a cup of tea before I start,\" she says. \"My first appointment is not until 9am.\"</p> <p>It is a schedule which made her performance in April's London Marathon - where she catapulted from relative obscurity into the British Olympic team - all the more remarkable. Prior to that race Morris juggled a 38-hour week and worked through her lunchbreaks in order to squeeze in her training runs. Since her selection her employers have allowed her to cut her hours to two days a week, enabling her to experience what most athletes of her calibre take for granted: training in daylight.</p> <p>\"Before I did London I was running 70 miles a week in the dark,\" she says. \"I would run in the morning before it was light and by the time I got home again it was dark.\" Now, she says, she not only has been able to increase her weekly mileage but has time for \"luxuries like massages\" and can \"run at the hottest part of our day\", to help prepare for the conditions in Athens. What she misses, she admits, is the contrast between full-time work and sport. \"I love both my job and my running and I think they balance each other out well. Because my work is based indoors I used to crave getting outside to run. I don't see my work as a hardship.\"</p> <p>Morris, 36, never intended to become an optician but \"fell into the profession by mistake\". At school in North Wales her ambition was to become a physical training instructor in the RAF, but in 1988 she got a summer job at an optician's and discovered she enjoyed the challenges of the job far more than she expected. \"I then trained for three years as a dispensing optician and a further two years to qualify as a contact lens optician.\" </p> <p>She now sees patients every 20 minutes throughout the day. \"I'm giving new patients a thorough eye test to check their eyes and vision are healthy and I show them how to take their lenses in and out.\"</p> <p>While she says she is unsure precisely what the future holds - \"nothing surprises me any more\" - she intends to return to her regular working hours after the games. \"I could never give up work completely,\" she says.</p> <p>Her colleagues are still trying to adjust to the realisation that Morris is more than an enthusiastic jogger. \"They knew I ran but thought I just did a couple of laps of the park,\" she says. \"After London they were a bit blown away. But then so was I.\"</p> <p>Morris is gradually getting used to her sudden rise in fame. \"One lady I was fitting with lenses recently was convinced she'd met me before, but couldn't think where. Then, as she was leaving she said, 'I know, you look like that runner who's going to the Olympics.' She was so embarrassed when I said well, actually, that is me.\"</p> <p> <strong> Ian Peel <br> Quality control manager and trap shooter </strong></p> <p>If Ian Peel is lucky, he sees his wife, Mary, for a few minutes each afternoon when he arrives home from work. Mostly, though, their weekday schedules are such that the couple \"pass like ships in the night\", Ian completing his 10-hour day as a quality control manager for a Lancashire textile dye company just in time to take over from Mary in looking after their two children, aged six and nine, as she leaves to begin a night shift at the local hospital where she works as a nurse.</p> <p>By any household's standards their routine is time-crunched, but more so when one realises that somewhere outside his work patterns and family commitments, Peel has to find time to train. </p> <p>\"It's not ideal,\" he says. \"A lot of the world's top shooters now practise seven days a week but my nearest gun club is a 100- mile trip to Hull, so I can only get there at weekends.\" </p> <p>In an attempt to compensate for the lack of time he can devote to training, he does dry-firing and visualisation in front of a mirror at home.</p> <p>\"Shooting is all about muscle memory - the more you do, the better you get,\" Peel says. \"Without getting to a gun club this is the next best thing.\"</p> <p>His lifestyle is a balancing act that few are required to attempt in these days of lottery funding and sponsorship. To make up time taken off for competitions, Peel often works on Saturdays.</p> <p>\"Until I won my Olympic silver I would get a lot of jealous jibes about being away so much, but my colleagues are more intrigued these days,\" he says.</p> <p>He admits his job can be stressful at times, \"especially when customers demand to know why their delivery is late\", but it is a pressure far removed from that he experiences in competitions.</p> <p>\"In some ways I think working has benefited my shooting,\" he says. \"I am keener and possibly more relaxed when I finally get to do it.\"</p> <p><strong> Christian Cormack <br> New media specialist and cox of men's eight </strong> </p> <p>Christian Cormack concedes that it is easy for rowers to find their lives completely consumed by their sport. It is, he says, like living in a capsule.</p> <p>\"There are times when it is very difficult to focus on anything but rowing,\" says the 27-year-old cox of the men's eight in Athens. \"But you also have to be aware that it won't go on for ever.\"</p> <p>It was the realisation that his own rowing career is unlikely to extend long past his 30th birthday that prompted Cormack to gain vocational skills.</p> <p>\"Very few athletes end up on the streets but, when you are used to being at the top level of what you do, it can be hard to adjust to doing something else when that comes to an end.\"</p> <p>Cormack is now employed as a new media specialist by the IT company Atos Origin. He originally got the part-time job through the Open (Olympic and Paralympic Employment Network) programme, a joint initiative between the British Olympic and Paralympic associations, UK Sport and the recruitment agency Blue Arrow, which aims to provide elite athletes and coaches with the opportunity to embark on a career path while still pursuing their personal goals in sport.</p> <p>\"I wasn't really well qualified in IT but I have developed a lot of skills on the job,\" Cormack says.</p> <p>Since December 2003 he has been working 10-15 hours a week on a flexible basis. \"There is a real contrast between sport and office life. It can be hard to adapt at first.\" </p> <p>Now , though, he thrives on being in a different environment for a few days a week and says he will look forward to returning in September. \"To other people, being sporty gives you a sort of seniority beyond your job,\" he says. \"They remember who you are because you are the person who leaves to go training and who always arrives at the office looking completely worn out.\"</p> <p><strong> Paul Green <br> Systems administrator and taekwondo competitor </strong> <br> A merging of two more alien worlds is difficult to imagine. In one life Paul Green, who is representing Great Britain at taekwondo in Athens and won a silver medal at last year's world championships, trains twice daily following a punishing programme that incorporates swimming, running and other elements of cross training for his sport. In the other, as a systems administrator for the Thales Group in Stockport, he develops naval technology devices including sonar systems for Ministry of Defence submarines.</p> <p>\"It sounds like they are worlds apart but actually they complement each other,\" he says. \"My job is very stressful but my training helps me cope with that. I go training at 6am and by the time I have finished I feel ready to tackle anything.\" Usually he works a five-day week, starting at 8am and finishing at 5pm, but in January the BOA and UK Sport's Open programme negotiated for him to reduce that considerably, to allow him to dedicate more time to preparing for Athens. He will return to his full-time hours in September.</p> <p>\"It's been great to have more time to train but, when you are away from the office, you really miss it,\" says 27-year-old Green. \"I have been at Thales for seven years and a lot of my friends have been made through work.\"</p> <p>It is, he believes, the stability of work that has benefited him most in terms of enhancing his sports performance. \"With taekwondo I never know where I am going to be,\" he says. \"It's great to travel and I love competing, but there's a lot to be said for coming back to your own bed every night.\"</p> <p> <strong> Helen Karagounis <br> Hat seller and 400m runner </strong> <br></p> <p>It is of constant amusement to Helen Karagounis's staff on the hat and bag stall in Nottingham's Broad Marsh shopping centre, where she works as a supervisor, that her life appears to be one exhausting, flat-out sprint.</p> <p>\"They think it's hilarious,\" she says. \"At the end of the day it's as if I am on my starting blocks to race out of the place and get to the track on time for training, whereas everyone else is off home to put their feet up for the evening.\"</p> <p>Until recently there was a third major commitment in her life, on top of training for the 4x400m relay in Athens and holding down a job which often requires her to be on her feet for nine hours a day. She was also attending lectures in classical civilisation at Nottingham University. With her husband, Leonidis, also being a student - he is studying for a PhD in molecular physiology - Karagounis says she has no option but to work.</p> <p>Although she gets lottery funding of around \u00a310,000 a year, she says that \"with both of us being students, money was understandably tight and we needed to boost our earnings because we were quite a low- income family\". It is only thanks to her salary from the Karroo bag stall that the couple have recently been able to purchase their first house in Nottingham.</p> <p> Not that she is complaining about having to fit so much into each 24 hours. \"I've been working on the stall for 18 months now and, although it can be a bit tiring, I do enjoy it,\" she says. \"Time passes quickly because there is a steady stream of browsers.\" </p> <p>In the build-up to Athens she has become something of a local celebrity. \"People have seen me on the regional news and come up just to see the 'hat and bag lady',\" she says. \"They are all shocked that I do this particular job because it is quite public.\"</p>",

The burden of starting favourite is a heavy one but today's women's road race - a nine-lap, 75-mile sightseeing tour of the cradle of democracy - could place the 21-year-old from Cowbridge among the true greats. <br></p> <p><strong> Other Brits to watch </strong> <br></p> <p>The women of Britain have not brought home an Olympic gymnastics medal since 1928, so make the most of Beth Tweddle, a sparky 19-year-old from the City of Liverpool club, in today's preliminary rounds. She's the first from these shores ever to stand serious comparison with the Russians, Romanians and Americans. Though she won't drag the British team to the big finals, she could well stir things up in the individual apparatus tussles, particularly in her favourite asymmetric bars.</p> <p>Ian Peel shattered enough clay in the Sydney trap shooting final to win a silver medal; this time he has his sights (actually, these chaps don't need sights) on something better.</p> <p>Finally, and if Britain's swimming revival has any substance, our highly-ranked breaststrokers Darren Mew and James Gibson should feature in this evening's 100m final. <br></p> <p><strong> One for the purist </strong> <br></p> <p>In the arcane tradition of Cambridge May Week (held in June, so they say, and lasts a fortnight), the three-day event takes up four, the first two devoted to the decorous top-hatted formalities of dressage. You can't win the thing on the first two days but you can sure lose it, so Pippa Funnell, William Fox-Pitt and the rest of Britain's five-rider team will be praying for calm, discipline and a quiet day at Athens airport, which is virtually on the equestrian centre's doorstep. <br></p> <p><strong> That's never a sport </strong> <br></p> <p>Softball.

  "<p><strong> Brits to watch </strong> <br></p> <p>Don't put your shirt on it but there is the chance of a first GB medal today. Judo begins with the tiniest of the tinies (men under 9st) and England's Commonwealth champion, 21-year-old Craig Fallon from the Black Country, is among the favourites.</p> <p>Peter Waterfield and Leon Taylor, an unlucky fourth in Sydney, will be keen to do better in the synchronised platform diving, that intriguing discipline which neatly dovetails Newtonian theory (if two bodies leave a 10-metre board at the same time they will hit the water simultaneously) with western moral philosophy (it's what you do on the way down that really matters).</p> <p>\"The biggest lungs in Britain\" - those of the three-times-gold-going-for-four-times-gold Matt Pinsent - begin their latest bid stroking the reconstituted men's four, and the two Caths (actually Cath and Kath), Bishop and Grainger, take the fruits of a good season's build-up into the heats of the women's pair. <br></p> <p><strong> Show stoppers </strong> <br></p> <p>The battle of the behemoths in the Olympic pool begins with a bit of solo point-scoring rather than a straight fight. The canoe-footed darling of Sydney, Ian Thorpe, sets out his stall in the 400m freestyle; the madly ambitious darling of Madison Avenue Michael Phelps begins his campaign in the individual medley. The rival Australian-American bellowing would be shaking the roof all week if the Greeks had found time to build one. <br></p> <p><strong> One for the purist </strong> <br></p> <p>It may be the first day for everyone else but the football started three days ago. Today it is off to the Cretan shores where Serbia-Montenegro face Australia in Heraklion. <br></p> <p><strong> That's never a sport </strong> <br></p> <p>Yngling - overall winner of the gold medal for stupidest name. Not a cross between yachting and angling but one of the dozen or so different types of sailing boat that will be chasing gold in Athens. Why not divide them by colours too? And it's bronze for Great Britain in the Spicy White With A Hint Of Mint Finn class. <br></p> <p><strong> Commentator's chestnut: </strong> <br></p> <p>\"And, however well you prepare, you just cannot legislate for the wind.\"</p> <p><strong>Focus on:</strong> <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/08/04/judo.pdf\">Judo</a></p> <p><strong> The day ahead </strong></p> <p><strong> Badminton </strong> <br>Women's singles; mixed doubles <br></p> <p><strong>Basketball</strong> <br>07.00-22.00 Women's preliminaries <br></p> <p><strong>Beach volleyball </strong> <br>07.00- 21.50 Men's and women's preliminaries <br></p> <p><strong> Boxing </strong> <br>11.30-20.30 Middle (75kg); light heavy (81kg) preliminaries <br></p> <p><strong>Cycling (road) </strong> <br>10.45-16.40 Men's road race <br></p> <p><strong>Diving </strong> <br>19.00-20.56 Women: synchronised 3m springboard Men: synchronised 10m platform <br></p> <p><strong>Fencing</strong> <br>08.00-18.10 Men's individual sabre <br></p> <p><strong> Football </strong> <br>16.00-18.00 Women's preliminaries <br>18.30-20.30 Men's preliminaries <br></p> <p><strong> Gymnastics </strong> <br>10.30-20.17 Men's qualification <br></p> <p><strong> Handball </strong> <br>07.30-21.10 Men's preliminaries <br></p> <p><strong> Hockey </strong> <br>06.30-19.30 Women's preliminaries <br></p> <p><strong> Judo </strong> <br>Men: -60kg. <br>Women: -48kg <br></p> <p><strong>Rowing </strong> <br>07.10-10.20 Heats: Men: single sculls; pair; double sculls; four.

  "<p><strong> Brits to watch </strong> <br></p> <p>Tests of loyalty and conspicuous patriotism begin today.

  "<p><strong> Brits to watch </strong> <br></p> <p>Forty-eight years ago Judy Grinham took the only Olympic backstroke title ever won by a British woman (the pictures arrived back from Melbourne about a week later) to earn herself a regular cameo spot with Bootsie and Snudge on The Army Game. The rewards will be far greater for Katy Sexton if she repeats that triumph over 100 metres. Her stronger event (200m) comes later in the week but a medal is not out of the question today. </p> <p>That same Melbourne games saw the elegant Dick McTaggart take lightweight boxing gold. This time Britain has only one boxer in the entire tournament: Amir Khan, also a lightweight, is a precocious 17-year-old from Bolton, broad-shouldered and 5ft 10in tall with credible ambitions to turn pro. <br></p> <p><strong> Show stoppers </strong> <br></p> <p>The tennis plutocrats - Federer and Roddick, Venus and Serena (but sadly no Maria Sharapova, as the Russian team was settled before her Wimbledon fairy tale) - are nearly all here from the start, battling through the early rounds as they do every week of their 11-month season from Tampa to Tokyo. There are rumours that a convenient city-centre hillside is to be temporarily renamed Mount Henman, with instructions for it to be reclaimed as a classical site straight after the quarter-finals. Cruel. <br></p> <p><strong> One for the purist </strong> <br></p> <p>Out in the squally seas south-east of Piraeus, nine fleets in various marine classes are well into their racing programme, the British led by Ben Ainslie (gold in Sydney), who can make his Finn sit up and beg or turn somersaults to order, Shirley Robertson (gold in Sydney), now with a crew of two to follow her orders in the Yngling, and, from today, Chris Draper and Simon Hiscocks (world champions in 2003) in their 49er.

  "<p>It was one of sport's greatest rivalries. Englishmen, they were born within a year of one another and yet were as different as chalk is from any cheese you'd care to mention except possibly that stuff the French make from goats' milk. As two of the greatest middle-distance runners the planet has known and supreme Olympians both, there is little wonder that much talk has been heard in the past few weeks of Schmaux and O'Heck.</p> <p>Sachaveral Schmaux came from an aristocratic and sporting family. At the age of 40 his father Darcy had won Britain's first Olympic gold, rowing to glory in the chinless fours, while his mother, Lavinia, was legendary in hunting circles and no mean hand in hunting squares and oblongs either.</p> <p>Their son's own exploits were legion. International footballer, cricketer and the man credited with introducing the ball to lawn tennis, he rode the winner of the 1924 Derby, a feat that has never been repeated in greyhound racing to this day.</p> <p>He finished second in the Monte Carlo Rally while still such a novice behind the wheel of a car that his navigator was the driving examiner; and he descended the Cresta Run on a silver drinks salver, his only protection an unshakable belief in his own moral superiority. At fencing, boxing and shooting he remained undefeated for three decades.</p> <p>Asked to explain the secret of his success he famously responded: \"If they are box ers, I fence 'em, if they are fencers I shoot 'em\".</p> <p>It was in athletics though that Schmaux truly shone, setting no fewer than 47 world records in 17 different events and vice-versa over the course of a decade. Little wonder that to many experts he remains the supreme British sportsman of all time.</p> <p>True, Schmaux's 1906 high jump world record mark of 35 inches looks unimpressive by today's standards but it must be remembered that he made his leap wearing stout brogues, plus fours, a Norfolk jacket and a raffish Tyrolean hat. As his friend Lambley Chumpkin observes: \"Had Sachers used modern sports kit and training methods there's no doubt in my mind that he could have broken the three-feet barrier and possibly even got beyond that.\" Schmaux may have refused to wear shorts or pumps and insisted on changing into evening wear at seven each night even if he were in mid- race at the time but he was fanatical about some aspects of preparation, believing for example that sex weakened an athlete's legs (\"though only if he's doing it correctly,\" as he used to joke).</p> <p>A man with an eye that was as prone to roving as the front wheel on a supermarket trolley, he still managed to abstain for a prolonged period before major competitions, as Chumpkin recalls. \"On the eve of the 1908 Olympics he came to me and said, 'You know I haven't been with a filly since 1905.' I said, 'Cripes, Sachers, that's a jolly long time.' He replied, 'Not really,' glancing at his pocket watch, 'it's only 19:32 now.' Hahahaha! 24-hour clock, you see? Frightfully amusing.\" Schmaux's great rival could not have been more different. Clegg O'Heck of Middendale in Yorkshire was the son of a second-generation Irish millworker. His father was out of work his entire life, unable to find a second-generation Irish mill to work in. The family were so poor they took it in turns to share a chilblain.</p> <p>Where O'Heck's ability on the track came from nobody knew. Unlike the gregarious and charming Schmaux, the proletarian Yorkshireman refused to speak to the press. Indeed he refused to speak to anyone. Brooding, grim and primal, even his wife, Bess, who bore him 42 children, never heard him utter a single word. \"E were like t'bitter frost of a February morning,\" she later said. \"E were silent but he had a way of getting inside even t'stoutest of clothing.\" O'Heck was so stocky that he was actually taller when lying down, his thighs were the size and complexion of oven-ready turkeys and his calves burst the bonds of even the sturdiest gaiters.</p> <p>His style was far from elegant - as Alex Cheam, author of the O'Heck biography, Run Silent, Run Fast, has said, he \"churned across the cinders like a runaway dray\" - but it suited the rugged conditions of the notoriously tough northern club circuit on which he began his career.</p> <p>As the two men rose to stardom, the public clamour for them to meet in competition mounted. Destiny called in the shape of the 880 yards at the so-called Intercalated Olympic Games held in Athens in 1906. It was the only time these two supreme athletes would meet.</p> <p>So many millions of words have been written about the epic contest that resulted that there is little purpose in adding to them. Suffice it to say here that we will never see the like of Schmaux and O'Heck again, nor that of the albino puffin that was to play such a singular and important part in the outcome of the race.</p>",
  "A strict new fireworks curfew carrying the threat of a \u00a35,000 fine and six months in jail comes into effect today. <p>The ban on letting off fireworks between 11pm and 7am is part of a package of measures to clamp down on anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>Exceptions have been made for special occasions, with new year revellers along with those celebrating Diwali and the Chinese new year given until 1am. But November 5 bonfire displays must be over by midnight, under the new laws. </p> <p>Shops are also banned from selling fireworks louder than 120 decibels, and it is an offence for under-18s to have them in a public place. </p> <p>The consumer minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, said: \"Introducing a curfew and a noise limit balances the law to ensure that people can still enjoy fireworks whilst cracking down on their anti-social use.\" </p> <p>Shops wanting to sell fireworks all year round will need a licence from their local council. Other suppliers, such as newsagents, will only be able to sell them during limited periods.</p>",
  "Voters may have to sign up for a unique identifying pin number before being allowed to take part in UK elections, as part of a bid to combat electoral fraud in postal ballots, the government suggested yesterday. <p>There was a cool response from opposition parties, which said the government should, for the moment, return to the \"tried and trusted\" ballot box.</p> <p>The local government minister, Nick Raynsford, said he planned to consult this autumn on moving to a system of individual voter registration that would help to eliminate vote \"theft\". The move has already been recommended by the Electoral Commission, but rejected by the House of Lords. </p> <p>The proposal is set out by Mr Raynsford in answer to calls from a committee of MPs for extra anti-fraud measures to be introduced before the use of controversial all-postal ballots is extended. The government said its ultimate goal was \"a multi-channelled general election, some time after 2006\". It is also looking at electronic voting. </p> <p>Mr Raynsford said any final decision on individual voter registration would wait for the Electoral Commission's verdict on June's large-scale trials of postal voting in the European elections before making any firm decision on the way forward. </p> <p>There were many allegations of fraud and ballot tampering during the elections, but little sign of prosecutions by police. Ministers are compiling a list of the postal vote allegations and looking at giving the police extra powers to investigate any fraud and tampering. </p> <p>The individual voter identifier would require primary legislation, and replace the current requirement for a postal voter to get someone to witness their ballot form. The government had been intending to use postal ballots for referendums on the creation of regional assemblies in three regions, but will now only hold one referendum, in the north.</p> <p>The select committee had recommended that the government work with the Office of National Statistics to use the next census period to implement the change.</p> <p>Mr Raynsford said the government accepted the need for extra security to be in place before all-postal voting was used more widely.</p> <p>Early indications suggested that the large-scale pilot schemes had boosted the turnout, doubling the numbers taking part in European elections in the trial areas. But Mr Raynsford admitted that the government needed to check whether the higher turnout was due to novelty.</p> <p>He said changing the way people voted was not a cure-all for low turnout, and political parties needed to do more to re-engage the electorate.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission, in its response, welcomed the committee's backing of its calls for extra security measures, tougher punishment for voting fraud and more help for disabled voters. </p> <p>The shadow minister Caroline Spelman welcomed moves to toughen security but said no further all-postal votes should go ahead until they were in place. </p> <p>\"We welcome that the government is looking to move ahead with individual electoral registration - as shown in Northern Ireland, it would significantly reduce scope for electoral fraud,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Yet, given [that] such legislation cannot be introduced in time for the regional assembly referendum in November, the government should cancel use of all-postal voting and restore the tried and trusted ballot box.\"</p>",
  "A triumphalist 83-point list of concessions extracted from Tony Blair as the price for continued support for Labour is being circulated internally by the trade unions. <p>The guide, seen by the Guardian, itemises commitments and is being billed as a new social contract between Labour and the unions.</p> <p>Some union leaders claim the future willingness of the government to deliver on the agreed agenda will test the relationship between the two wings of the Labour movement during a third term.</p> <p>The list is more exhaustive and wide-ranging than had been thought when the unions negotiated the deal at the national policy forum at the end of last month. </p> <p>At the heart of the list are commitments on public services which include: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Extending workforce protection in local government across the public services </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Consulting key stakeholders to monitor private finance initiatives </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Network Rail to oversee all rail engineering works, and the introduction of a national rail card </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> An agreement to tackle unequal pay in local government </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A commitment not to extend selection by ability in schools. </p> <p>The length of the list is likely to be taken by the Conservatives as a sign that Mr Blair is still at the mercy of the unions as the party's membership plummets, cutting off a major alternative source of funds to the party. </p> <p>Ministers agree that the list is long, but point out to business leaders that major \"red lines\" have not been crossed, and say that many of the commitments are a promise only to review issues. </p> <p>Others in the Labour leadership, including Ian McCartney, the party's chairman, see the list as a sign that the party remains radical and can work constructively with the unions. </p> <p>Some argue that the list also raises questions about the relevance of the TUC, traditionally the organisation that negotiates with a Labour government </p> <p>The list has been drawn up by Tulo, the Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation, a group of unions affiliated to Labour and marshalled by the four biggest. </p> <p>The checklist also includes elements on what the unions describe as fairness at work. </p> <p>It talks of \"a commitment to work in partnership with strong modern trade unions and to help such unions grow\", as well as \"family friendly rights\". </p> <p>It says that pensions should be protected where they are affected by a company transfer or merger, and that same-sex partners should be awarded equal rights. </p> <p>On Iraq, the guide says the issue of military intervention will be sent to Labour's autumn party conference. </p> <p>Military intervention should only be made as \"a last resort where all non-violent methods have failed, operating within international law and the framework of the UN\".</p> <p><b>New social contract</b></p> <p><b> Public services</b> </p> <p>Confirmation PFI does not require transfer of staff; bulk of NHS services will remain directly provided; review of NHS cleaning contracts on test of cleanliness; commitment to address term-time workers' issues; promote healthy eating in schools </p> <p><b> Pensions</b> </p> <p>Steps to make pension credit payment more automatic and steps to remove old-style means testing; pensions to become a bargaining issue for union recognition purposes; commitment on pensions for same-sex partners; assistance for those who have already lost out in occupational pensions; training for pensions trustees and move to 50% member trustees; legislation if necessary following the Turner commission to move beyond the current voluntary occupational pensions system </p> <p><b> Manufacturing</b> </p> <p>Increase research and development investment to 2.5% of national income; improve export credit facilities; \u00a3178m funding for technology strategy by 2007-08, encourage public procurement contracts to be given to UK firms; support an EU review of procurement policy; ensure regional development agencies produce manufacturing strategies and work with employers and trade unions; Bank of England to take note of regional and employment data, and to engage with trade unions</p> <p><b> Additional commitments</b> </p> <p>Royal Mail to stay in public hands; telecom regulation to focus on service choice and reliability as well as network competition; review the national insurance lower earnings limit to help low-paid workers get benefits; action to tackle unethical labour agencies in the health sector; consider certification of air cabin crew; extend training for white collar police staff </p> <p><b> Party conference issues</b> </p> <p>Asylum seekers to retain right of appeal to high court; review arrangements for compensation for time off for community activities; no donation caps on political parties</p>"
