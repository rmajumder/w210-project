  "Nissim Vaknin emerged from the hospital dazed and bare chested. Slowly he put on his blood-splattered shirt and described how he escaped death on the number 6 bus. <p>\"I got on the bus near the post office and found one seat remaining. At the next stop, a woman asked if she could sit down. I gave my seat to her. I moved back toward the centre of the bus,\" he said. </p> <p>At least 16 people were killed and more than 80 injured in the double bus bombing in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. The 65-year-old seemed almost embarrassed that he had escaped. </p> <p>\"Around 300 metres later, the bus exploded. There was panic, smoke, choking from the smoke. I somehow got out from the front door. </p> <p>\"When I saw his body in pieces, I realised I had sat next to the bomber. He was young. At first, I thought he was a woman because he had longish hair, maybe even a wig. He didn't look suspicious to me while I was sitting next to him.\" </p> <p>It appears both bombers got on buses at Beersheba's bus station a few minutes before 2.50pm. The bus stops and buses were relatively quiet as most shoppers had escaped the afternoon heat of the Negev desert a few hours before. </p> <p>The buses headed off in the same direction, one less than 100 metres ahead. The bomber in the first bus blew himself up and the second bomber followed suit. However, the split second difference may have saved a number of lives. </p> <p>Yaakov Cohen, driver of the second bus, saw the first explosion and thought his bus might be next. He opened the doors and raced out, giving himself and some passengers time to get out. </p> <p>\"I saw the first explosion and thought, 'My God, I've got to get out of here'. I drove about 10 metres and opened the doors,\" he said from his hospital bed in Beersheba, where he was treated for leg wounds. </p> <p>\"I believe between 10 and 15 people got off my bus. Suddenly, I heard a huge explosion. It was terrible ... I don't want to describe what I saw.\" </p> <p>Mr Cohen said he had checked all his passengers but had not noticed anyone suspicious. \"Believe me, I look and check,\" he told Reuters. \"It is very hard to identify a bomber ... I don't know how anyone can.\" </p> <p>The scene of the explosions was identical to any of a score that have happened over the last three years. The frames of the buses were intact but the windows were sprayed like confetti over a wide area. </p> <p>At the hospital, Mr Vaknin pondered his escape. \"Now I'm in terrible anguish. My life was spared because I gave up my seat for a woman who died. </p> <p>\"Yes, a miracle happened that I was saved, but my conscience is not clean because I feel I caused her death. It will take me a long time to get over this.\"</p>",
  "Slobodan Milosevic yesterday launched his defence as the first European head of state accused of genocide by blaming everyone but the Serbs and himself for the bloodbath of Yugoslavia's disintegration. <p>In a four-hour speech at the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague 30 months into his trial on 66 counts of war crimes, Mr Milosevic turned the tribunal dock into a soapbox as he raced through more than 100 years of Serbian history, a narrative that consistently had the Germans and the Vatican in the starring roles as the bad guys in the unending plots to destroy the Serbs. </p> <p>\"The Serb people, the Serb leadership and I personally made every attempt to preserve the Yugoslav community. We were on the side of the law,\" the former Yugoslav and Serbian president asserted in a vigorous performance that betrayed little signs of the ill-health that caused yesterday's defence statement to be repeatedly postponed. </p> <p>Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright, Tony Blair, Helmut Kohl, the mullahs of Iran, the Hizbullah of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, fascists, neo-Nazis, the Vatican, and the European Union were all blamed for acting in concert with \"Albanian terrorists\", \"Bosnian Islamic fundamentalists\", and \"Croatian [fascist] Ustashe\" to destroy Yugoslavia. </p> <p>For the four wars that Mr Milosevic fought and lost, leaving more than two million homeless and more than 200,000 dead through the 1990s, the Serbs and their leader were utterly blameless. </p> <p>\"Yugoslavia didn't simply disappear into thin air. It was destroyed violently by a plan and by a war that is still being waged,\" he declared, stabbing his fingers at the bench of three judges, shuffling his papers, and using his spectacles as a theatrical prop. \"The war in Yugoslavia was not started by Serbs or in Serbia. It was started by Ustashe, neo-Nazis, Islamic fundamentalists, and Albanian terrorists. It is not hard to prove.\" </p> <p>He added that Nato used depleted uranium shells in the air war against Serbia in 1999 to destroy Serbia's prospects of developing a thriving organic farming sector. </p> <p>Halfway through Mr Milosevic's opening statement, Judge Patrick Robinson interrupted to warn him that his potted history of Serbdom was irrelevant to the business at hand. \"You must discipline yourself,\" the judge told him. \"It's questionable whether a lot of what you are saying is relevant to your case.\" </p> <p>Much of the speech was inadmissible as evidence, the judge warned. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has 150 days in court to attempt to rebut the 66 charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against hu manity in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo between 1991 and 1999. But while the prosecution has pressed criminal charges against a single individual in order to avoid stigmatising any of the peoples of former Yugoslavia as collectively guilty of war crimes, Mr Milosevic's tactics are clearly to distance himself from personal involvement and portray the tribunal as an anti-Serbian plot. </p> <p>\"This is aimed at the audience back home,\" said Nenad Stefanovic, a Serbian commentator. \"Many people will believe it.\" </p> <p>Mr Milosevic, devoting a large tranche of his statement to attacks on the legitimacy of the tribunal, which he refuses to recognise, said: \"This tribunal is an instrument of war, not of justice.\" Rising last as the panel of three judges entered the courtroom yesterday morning, Mr Milosevic stood blowing his nose before sitting down and addressing the judge as \"Mr Robinson\". </p> <p>Halfway through his statement, Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor, appeared to be dozing off. She was flanked by Geoffrey Nice, the British lawyer who has spent more than two years building a detailed picture of Mr Milosevic's alleged crimes. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic complained he was not being given long enough for his statement. Judge Robinson told him he was having his \"second bite at the cherry\" but later ruled that Mr Milosevic could continue his statement this morning. </p> <p>The judges are examining at least three confidential statements from heart specialists who have examined Mr Milosevic since the trial was adjourned at the beginning of July because of the accused's heart condition and high blood pressure. One of the medical experts has concluded that Mr Milosevic is not fit to defend himself, although he refuses to accept defence lawyers. </p> <p>The judges are expected to decide later this week whether to impose a defence team on Mr Milosevic. He is scheduled to call his first witness, \"a very important expert\" on former Yugoslavia, next week.</p>",
  "An Islamist group yesterday released video footage showing 12 Nepalese workers dying in the worst mass killing of hostages since Sunni Islamist extremists embarked on a spree of kidnappings in April. <p>News of the killings overshadowed international efforts to secure the release of two French journalists held by a separate Iraqi group of militants, who are demanding that France overturns its ban on Muslim headscarves in schools. </p> <p>A series of photographs and a video were posted on an Islamist website by Ansar al-Sunna yesterday showing one Nepalese hostage being beheaded and the others shot. </p> <p>\"We have carried out the sentence of God against 12 Nepalis who came from their country to fight the Muslims and to serve the Jews and the Christians ... believing in Buddha as their God,\" said the statement by the military committee of the Army of Ansar al-Sunna. </p> <p>If all 12 workers are confirmed dead, the killing represents the largest number of foreign hostages to die at one time at the hands of rebels in Iraq, who have taken more than 100 hostages over the past few months. </p> <p>The Nepalis were kidnapped when they entered Iraq from Jordan to work as cooks and cleaners for a Jordanian firm. </p> <p>The recording showed two masked men holding down a hostage. One of the men used a knife to behead the hostage and then held his head aloft. The video then showed a group of hostages lying face down and being shot by a man using an automatic rifle. </p> <p>Ansar al-Sunna, one of several militant groups to emerge following the fall of Saddam Hussein, said it kidnapped the Nepalis because they were cooperating with US troops. </p> <p>In France, there was growing anxiety for the safety of Christian Chesnot of Radio France International and Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro, and their Syrian driver, as the extended deadline for the French government to respond to their captors' demands expired. </p> <p>France's most senior politicians spent their third day running in crisis meetings. French envoys collected new declarations of support from figures in the Arab world who might possibly have some influence over the militants responsible for the kidnapping, the Islamic Army of Iraq. </p> <p>Islamic religious leaders joined political leaders in Egypt, Qatar, Jordan and from the Palestinian Authority to call for the journalists' release. </p> <p>Late on Monday night, soon after the first deadline expired, the two men were shown for the second time on the Arab television station, al-Jazeera, warning that their lives would be at risk if the French government refused to overturn legislation which bans pupils from displays of religious affiliation at school. </p> <p>Both men appealed to the French nation to protest against the law. </p> <p>However, the 100 or so people who turned out for a show of solidarity with the journalists at Paris's central mosque yesterday were not calling for repeal of the law, but simply for the men's release.</p>",
  "The department of homeland security's de facto veto of the University of Notre Dame's appointment of the Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan to a chair in the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies is offensive, not least as a denial of academic freedom (An oft-repeated 'truth', August 31). This revocation of Ramadan's work visa bears the imprint of those influential supporters of Israel's rightwing government in the Pentagon. These pro-Sharon neocons have been at the centre of the Bush administration's foreign policy. <p>A close scrutiny of Ramadan's work reveals an erudite, provocative scholar; one committed to the further evolution of Islam's understanding of its revelation and religious practice. Moreover, he is concerned to facilitate the discussions that must ensue if Judaism, Christianity and Islam are to build mutual respect en route to developing some common ground. </p> <p>We must examine the tactics of Ramadan's accusers. While they offer no evidence that he is a threat to US security, he is readily charged with being anti-semitic - a tactic widely used by pro-Sharon elements in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and those in the Pentagon who would intimidate and silence critics of the current government of Israel. This tactic is being widely used by neoconservatives, for example Daniel Pipes, whose campuswatch website encourages students to report professors who contest Israel's policies. </p> <p>In short, criticism of Israel is now glibly equated with anti-semitism. (Ramadan's offence, inter alia, was to have rebuked French Jewish intellectuals for their silence on Israel's murderous tactics in the occupied territories.) What is more, it is not only Muslim leaders and other non-Jewish opponents of Israel's continued control and settlement of the territories who are targeted in this manner. Jews in the peace movements who protest Sharon's policies also find themselves smeared as anti-semitic, \"self-hating Jews\". <br><b>Prof Peter Walshe</b> <br>Fellow of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA </p> <p> Ramadan has pointed out that an oft-repeated assumption becomes the \"truth\". For that reason, not only is he now a terrorist sympathiser, but also his accusers, by withdrawing his visa, are maintaining the illusion that they are conducting a war on terror. They are thus neatly reversing the actual truth, while ensuring that the culture under attack, Islam, is never understood by the people whose leadership is intent on global hegemony. <br><b>David Clarke</b> <br>London</p>",
  "<b>Sydney Morning Herald</b> <br>Editorial, August 30 <p>\"The prime minister, John Howard ... announced the October 9 election a week earlier than electoral law requires because ... he wanted to short-circuit resumption of a parliamentary investigation of claims that, in the last days of the 2001 election campaign, he knowingly perpetuated the lie [that refugees, in a boat intercepted by HMAS Adelaide, used the threat of throwing their children into the ocean to try to gain asylum]. The allegation is unproved but recent evidence ... has entrenched, as one of the key issues of this campaign, Mr Howard's credibility and his government's truthfulness ...</p> <p>\"Mr Howard's challenge is to get voters focused on issues that reflect kindly on his eight years as prime minister. Top of that list is unprecedented economic prosperity.\"</p> <p><b>Advertiser</b><br>Editorial, August 31</p> <p>\"Interest rates and economic management have become key themes of the election campaign's opening. Mr Howard has succeeded in turning the debate on to his chosen issue and perceived strength. [He] has warned interest rates would rise more under a Labor government than they would if his government was returned ...</p> <p>\"The issue of economic management deserves to hold centre stage during this campaign. Mr Howard justifiably highlights his government's strong record on interest rates, unemployment and inflation ... While Mr Howard cannot claim his government is the only factor behind low interest rates, the challenge is ahead of [the Labor leader] Mark Latham to prove he can better the status quo.\"</p> <p><b>Australian</b><br>Editorial, August 30</p> <p>\"This was the election Mr Howard had to call. He was bleeding too badly. He needed to transform the political climate even if that meant living with a risky six-week campaign running to October 9 ... The most potent line he delivered [on Sunday] was: 'I will guarantee that interest rates are always going to be lower under a Coalition government.' This is a credible pledge on the most income-sensitive point for Australian households. It signals Mr Howard's plan to make Australia's economic future the election issue - a challenge Mr Latham has so far avoided. Election 2004 is highly unpredictable - a battle between two leaders, divided by generation and temperament.\"</p> <p><b>Greg Barnes</b><br>Herald Sun, August 31</p> <p>\"The 2004 election is shaping up as Mr Howard's toughest ... The opinion polls have [shown] a handful of votes splits the two main parties ...</p> <p>\"But the most disappointing aspect of this ... election is the likely lack of strong alternative visions.

On both counts, it's a tall order ... Mr Howard might have played fast and loose with our trust, but with the campaign focus about to turn to economic management, and Labor still to release its crucial tax policy, it's way too early for us to give our trust - or our vote - to either party.\"</p>",
  "Hans Vonk, who has died in his native Amsterdam at the age of 63, took up the baton at a time when conductors were polarised between the media-friendly superstar autocrat and the kapellmeister, a much-derided term for a musician working alongside his players to achieve the best possible results for the music itself. Vonk fell unobtrusively into the latter class, and he remained true to his values during the last five years of his career as music director of the St Louis Symphony Orchestra, in Missouri. <p>It was a period he described candidly as having been \"the happiest and most fulfilling of my career\", at the time the unspecified neurological disease which led to his death became uncontrollable in the spring of 2002. Of his St Louis players, who reciprocated the affection, he once said: \"they are a special kind of people, and I am one of them\". </p> <p>Vonk's father, a violinist in Amsterdam's great Concertgebouw Orchestra, died when Hans was three years old. Along with his sister, Vonk followed his mother's wishes by studying law at Amsterdam University, playing jazz piano in his spare time to support himself; music became the centre of his life when he moved to the Amsterdam Conservatory, discovering his true vocation after accompanying for a conducting class. Studies with the rigorous Hermann Scherchen and Franco Ferrara led to his first post with the Dutch Ballet shortly after his graduation in 1966. </p> <p>There he met and fell in love with the red-headed ballerina Jessie Folkerts, the wife of three decades who survives him. He became an assistant conductor at the Concertgebouw in 1969, and conducted his first opera at the Netherlands Opera in 1971, a Lorca-based drama by the singular German serialist Wolfgang Fortner. Vonk's commitment to contemporary music always came second to his love and understanding of the romantic repertoire, crowned by his Bruckner interpretations, but he remained a stalwart ambassador for Dutch music, of which he has left a central legacy in the shape of a six-CD set. </p> <p>Alongside further important positions with orchestras in his native land - the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic from 1973, the Hague Residentie Orchestra from 1980 - Vonk now began to appear with orchestras elsewhere in Europe and in America. He made his debut with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1974, and was associate conductor of London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1976 to 1979. Among his many recordings from this period is an outstanding, underrated partnership in Rachmaninov with the pianist Ilana Vered and the London Symphony Orchestra. </p> <p>What should have been the most important move in his conducting career turned out to be something of a poisoned chalice. In 1985 he accepted an invitation from the East German authorities to take on both the Dresden Staatskapelle Orchestra and the Dresden Opera, a double responsibility only the eminent Austrian-born conductor Karl B\u00f6hm had undertaken before him. Permitted to talk to players only at rehearsals, Vonk found the results alien to his spirit of cooperative conducting, and he was happier moving to West Germany and the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1991. </p> <p>Nevertheless he achieved many fine things in Dresden, conducting Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier at the newly renovated Semperoper; a recording was subsequently released. Londoners may also recall a Staatskapelle visit crowned by a performance of Strauss's Ein Heldenleben in the understated, free-flowing tradition of B\u00f6hm and Rudolf Kempe. </p> <p>By the time he left Dresden, Vonk had already been diagnosed with what was then - in 1988 - believed to be Guillain-Barre syndrome; after a year's respite, he was back on the podium. As his St Louis residency progressed, it became clear that the symptoms - increasing muscular weakness starting with the hands and feet - were taking a different course, and his neurological condition was identified as similar to Lou Gehrig's disease. </p> <p>In February 2002, he had to be helped from the podium after finding he could not turn the pages of a score by Samuel Barber, and he resigned his post shortly before giving his last concert that May. He bowed out in style with a performance of Mahler's Fourth Symphony. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hans Vonk, conductor, born 18 June 1941; died 29 August 2004</p>",
  "When Zell Miller approaches the microphone at the Republican national convention tonight, he will be securing himself a quixotic place in American political history. <p>The Georgia senator will become the first person to deliver the keynote address at two national conventions, each time for a different party. </p> <p>Twelve years ago, he stood at the same spot, in the well of Madison Square Garden, and delivered a homage to Bill Clinton. He still calls himself a Democrat, but this time, at the age of 72, he will go to the Garden to sing the praises of a conservative Republican, George Bush. </p> <p>In so doing, he has turned himself into a powerful electoral tool for the Bush Republicans as they strive to present themselves as a crossover party of the centre. The value they put on this veteran senator is reflected in the role they have given him at the New York convention. As keynote speaker, he has the task of capturing the mood of philosophy of a party that is not his own. </p> <p>But this is no ordinary Democrat. Zigzag Zell, as he is known in Georgia, has been moving towards this moment for at least four years. He has made the excoriation of his party the focal mission of his twilight political years, raising the inevitable question of why he does not simply leave. </p> <p>Mr Miller's response is that it is not he who abandoned the Democrats but the Democrats who abandoned America's south and its conservative principles. \"If this is a national party, sushi is our national dish. If this is a national party, surfing has become our national pastime,\" he argues. \"The modern south and rural America are as foreign to our Democratic leaders as some place in Asia or Africa.\" </p> <p>Hyperbole is part of the combative speaking style Senator Miller has brought with him from the impoverished Appalachian hills of northern Georgia, a provenance he believes the Democratic elite has always looked down on. There is a streak of personal bitterness that runs through his polemic. </p> <p>He did not always feel this way. The last time he spoke to a full house at Madison Square Garden, in 1992, he was Georgia's governor - a Democrat and Clinton supporter who embraced the New Democrat agenda of fiscal restraint, tough anti-crime policies and strong defence. In his speech, he had some caustic asides about the first President Bush, though nothing as bitter as the remarks he is likely to aim in John Kerry's direction tonight. </p> <p>In 2000, he was even considered as a possible Democratic running mate for Al Gore, although he never quite made the shortlist. Having been passed over for the vice-presidential ticket, Mr Miller came out of political retirement to fill the Senate seat vacated by a Republican, Paul Coverdell, who died in 2000. The new senator soon made it clear he remained a Democrat only in name, voting consistently in support of President Bush since his inauguration in January 2001. </p> <p>Senator Miller even co-sponsored the new administration's huge tax cut. He wholeheartedly backed the war in Iraq and has spent much of the rest of his time writing a book-length attack on the Democrats, titled A National Party No More. </p> <p>\"Increasingly he felt out of place in the Democratic party over issues like abortion and gun control,\" said Merle Black, a professor at Atlanta's Emory University. \"But there's also the national security issue. He's an ex-marine. He thinks this is world war two all over again and he believes both parties should support the president. He really believes George Bush has been a strong leader.\"</p>",
  "The only Francoist minister still active in Spanish politics, Manuel Fraga, announced yesterday that he will seek re-election as premier of Galicia region, in the north-west. <p>Mr Fraga, 81, was General Francisco Franco's minister of information and tourism in the 1960s and remained loyal to the dictator until his death. </p> <p>Known to supporters as Don Manuel, he has run the semi-autonomous government of Galicia since 1989, winning four elections in a row. </p> <p>A fifth victory would make him one of Europe's oldest working politicians. </p> <p>\"Get ready to put up with me for another legislature,\" he said, comparing himself to the German postwar chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who left office aged 87. </p> <p>With regional elections due next year, Mr Fraga aims to remain in his post until he is 86. </p> <p>\"I am in fine form,\" he said, adding that one reason he was staying was to prevent infighting in the Galician section of the People's party. </p> <p>Mr Fraga became a key player in the political transition when Spain tilted towards democracy, after Franco's 1975 death, under the newly restored monarchy. </p> <p>He founded the rightwing People's Alliance party and became the right's representative on the commission which drafted the 1978 constitution. </p> <p>The party later changed its name to People's party and, after several failed attempts to win power nationally, Mr Fraga gave control to his chosen successor Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, who became prime minister in 1996 and was defeated in March this year. </p> <p>Mr Fraga remains the People's party's \"founding president\". The opposition attacks his Francoist past and accuses him of running Galicia as a personal fiefdom. </p> <p>As information minister he was the Franco regime's chief censor, though he also introduced new freedoms in the press and publishing which historians say helped increase the pressure for democratic change. </p> <p>In the past decade Mr Fraga has several times announced his imminent retirement from active politics, only to claim that for the good of his party, Galicia or Spain, he has been persuaded to stay on.</p>",

I get dance anthems (Daily Star), classic crooners (the People), cult solo artists (the Independent), Motown hits (Sunday Express) and Rough Trade acts, including the Strokes (Sunday Times). The most popular contributor is Morrissey (two appearances), the most weekend-enhancing song is Get Ready by the Temptations and the most useful inclusion is Ce Ce Peniston's floor-filling Finally. Thanks to the Star, I'm saved the expense of buying the somewhat optimistically named Essential Ce Ce Peniston. </p> <p>On weekdays, newspapers are stony ground for the free-CD-lover, so I resort to magazines. Uncut, like the Sunday Express, plumps for Motown, Kerrang! showcases its award nominees, Word tips new acts such as the Concretes and Mojo corrals intriguing US covers of Beatles songs, none of which I own. Come the weekend, the Independent and Sunday Express deliver sequels to last week's discs. I now have more free Motown than I can eat, plus a copy of Phil Oakey and Giorgio Moroder's inexplicably poignant 1984 hit, Electric Dreams. </p> <p>So the readers are happy, as are the publications: the first Motown CD pushed the Sunday Express's circulation to a 2004 high of 1.2 million. But John Glover, chairman of the 650-strong Music Managers Forum, fiercely opposes the policy, claiming it undermines the industry's anti-piracy message: \"On the one hand the industry is saying it wants you to pay for music and on the other hand it's giving it away.\" Glover, who advocates a blanket ban, says that most artists get no performance royalties, only publishing ones, from give-aways and experience a negligible boost to record sales. His message may be getting through: EMI recently withdrew established acts such as Coldplay and Kylie from the cover-mount market. </p> <p>Glover admits that if cover-mounts were shabby, cynical and cheaply produced they wouldn't be a threat. The problem is, they're too good. I've spent \u00a322.65 for 135 tracks. Against iTunes's price of 79p, that's less than 17p a song, and only 8p if you just count papers. I've listened to Bing Crosby, Belle &amp; Sebastian, Livin' Joy, Slipknot and Richie Havens. And when you buy papers merely for free CDs, you certainly get an interesting view of the world.</p>",
  "<p>I'm not the first person to suggest Mozart suffered from Tourette's syndrome. The idea was mooted by a Scandinavian scientist who based his theory on the scatological tone of Mozart's letters. But, as a composer and somebody with Tourette's, I have a unique perspective. What I set out to do was to reassess the documentary evidence, as well as to analyse the music. Was there something there that only somebody with Tourette's would recognise? </p> <p>Tourette's is often misunderstood. It is not just a matter of uncontrolled swearing; only about 20% of sufferers exhibit this symptom. Tourette's is a \"cluster\" disorder: because it is made up of separate symptoms, no two Touretters are the same. It consists of physical twitches, vocal twitches, obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. You can control the obsessions and compulsions for a time, but eventually they have to find an outlet, like an itch that has to be scratched. </p> <p>Mozart had numerous obsessions: clocks, cats, shoe sizes, his wife's safety - he had an unnatural fear of letting her out of the house. There is evidence of him twitching, grimacing, tapping his feet together and behaving oddly. As Peter Shaffer noted in Amadeus, he loved diversions and was always the life and soul of the party; he enjoyed rhymes, silliness and playing with words; he liked jokes and sometimes went too far, in the way that Tourette's sufferers often do. </p> <p>The language in his letters was sometimes filthy. In the 18th century, filthiness was largely sanctioned, but Mozart took it further than even his broad-minded contemporaries could accept. Not only did he write disgusting letters but he wrote disgusting songs, often set to the most beautiful music. That is an indication of the tension between chaos and control in Mozart's music. </p> <p>When Mozart was born, counterpoint and fugue were going out of fashion. The great courts of Europe wanted nice, fluffy, tuneful dance music. But Mozart rejected the less complex, more formalised musical forms with which he had grown up and looked back to the fugues of Bach and Handel. Fugue and counterpoint became an obsession and he reinvented them: the contrapuntal complexity of his six \"Haydn\" quartets baffled his friends. </p> <p>Fugues appear to be chaotic but are rigidly and beautifully structured. Mozart loved to write passages that broke all the rules, yet needed to keep them within a tight overall musical structure. I can't prove Mozart had Tourette's, but it would explain a great deal about the way he composed and the direction his music took. He would have been a genius anyway, but I like to think Tourette's gave a distinctive flavour to his musical processes.</p>",
  "Yesterday's double suicide bombing in Beersheba was the first inside Israel for five months. <p>Until the most recent attacks, members of Israel's security establishment had been quietly congratulating themselves on breaking the back of Palestinian \"terror networks\", though they have always recognised that even the tightest preventive measures cannot stop the occasional bomber getting through. </p> <p>According to the army, there has been a fall of slightly more than 90% in the number of attacks and a decrease of more than 70% in the number of Israelis killed. </p> <p>Israel has hailed this as proof of the effectiveness of the West Bank barrier, built in defiance of international law. </p> <p>While the number of attacks dropped sharply, the number of attempted attacks that were foiled in various stages of preparation remained high. </p> <p>Statistics for what the army classifies as terrorist attacks (not suicide bombings alone) indicate 85 failed attacks in the seven months to August 1, and only 10 successful attacks. </p> <p>Construction of the barrier has been accompanied by other measures - mass arrests, restrictions on movement and assassination of militants - which may have been equally significant. </p> <p>The number of Israeli civilians killed by Palestinians inside Israel in the first half of this year was 31, according to the human rights group B'Tselem. This compares with 86 in the whole of 2001, 173 in 2002 and 89 in 2003, suggesting a smaller reduction in deaths than the army claims. </p> <p>In the meantime, the killing of Palestinians continues unabated, with 2004 set to become the second worst since the uprising began. </p> <p>In the first six months of this year, 362 Palestinians died in the occupied territories at the hands of Israeli security forces, according to B'Tselem. </p> <p>Israeli security forces killed 454 Palestinians in the occupied territories in 2001, 990 in 2002 and 573 in 2003. </p> <p>During the last two years, virtually all the original leaders of Hamas in Gaza have been killed, and the militant Palestinian organisation now operates in a much more secretive way. </p> <p>It also acknowledges that Israel has made its attacks more difficult. </p> <p>\"Israel's security measures are very tight,\" Sami Abu Zuhri, the Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said last month. \"It is true we have tried and failed. It is very difficult to launch operations.\" </p> <p>Khader Habib, a founder of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, told a similar story. </p> <p>\"The number of operations has decreased, but that is for the time being, and the struggle is still alive,\" he said. \"There are cells still trying and failing, but still trying and still training. There are a lot of obstacles, a lot of security. We have lost a lot of people.\" </p> <p>Faced with Israel's plan to withdraw from Gaza, the militants may also have to reconsider their tactics. The PLO and Fatah leadership, encouraged by its recent success against Israel in the international court of justice, has begun exploring new options for non-violent struggle. </p> <p>Despite yesterday's bombings, Hamas, too, will be looking for a more political role once the Israelis leave Gaza.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Clive Woodward today ended speculation about his future by revealing that he is to resign as England's rugby union coach.</p> <p>Speaking as he arrived at a scheduled meeting at Twickenham with the RFU, Woodward said: \"I will be handing in my resignation later today.\"</p> <p>Asked if he anyone had tried to change his mind, Woodward shook his head and said, \"no one's tried to talk me out if it.\"</p> <p>It is not yet clear when his resignation will take effect. However, he is unlikely to be in charge when the Six Nations starts early next year.</p> <p>Woodward has been strongly linked with a coaching role at the Southampton Football Club because of his friendship with chairman Rupert Lowe.</p> <p>\"Sir Clive expressed an interest in getting into football and has looked at our academy and other aspects of the club,\" Lowe said. \"If we can learn from him about motivation, improving individuals and becoming world-class, then great. </p> <p>\"And if we can help him then we are very happy, too. Relationships sometimes are not planned - they just grow. He's running the England rugby team for the next 12 months, as I am aware, but I will be discussing his involvement at the board meeting on Thursday.\" </p> <p>Woodward's contract was due to expire after he had led England's World Cup title defence in France in 2007. He has coached England in 83 Tests - winning 59, drawing two and losing 12. </p> <p>The RFU had responded to speculation regarding Woodward's future by issuing a brief statement yesterday, quoting him as saying he will honour his existing contract. But that is thought to include provision for a 12-month notice period.</p> <p>England are scheduled to play eight Tests this season - Canada, South Africa and Australia in November, followed by their 2005 6 Nations Championship campaign. </p> <p>Woodward, who supports Chelsea, had earlier said in an interview: \"My whole background is in football. I love football and I go to as many games as I possibly can. I never had that passion for rugby I have for football. I never got into rugby in the same way.\" </p> <p>The 48-year-old was sent to a rugby-playing school by his father and he revealed: \"It caused a huge rift in the family that's still there in a way. </p> <p>\"I was forced into playing rugby because that's the only game the school played. And I hated it. I ran away a couple of times because of football. I didn't mind being at boarding school. I just hated not playing football.\" </p> <p>England have been in a form tailspin since their 2003 World Cup win. Clive Woodward's men have lost five of their past six games, including a winless three-Test tour of the antipodes during June this year, as they've struggled to adapt to several retirements - Martin Johnson, Jason Leonard and Neil Back chief among them - as well as a neck injury to Jonny Wilkinson.</p> <p>Woodward is set to coach the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand in 2005, and it is unclear how his resignation will affect this commitment.</p> <p>If Woodward does depart from Twickenham, there is no clear favourite to replace him. </p> <p>But his current No2, former Bath head coach Andy Robinson, Gloucester rugby director Nigel Melville and Newcastle boss, ex-England fly-half Rob Andrew, would all feature as contenders.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; FROM MICHAEL WHITE IN WESTMINSTER</b></p> <p>The Guardian's political editor watched Tony Blair address the faithful this afternoon and talk about his plans for the next few months.</p> <p>\"It's a very hot Wednesday afternoon, and I've just walked across Parliament Square, past the anti-war demonstration that has been there for a couple of years, to listen to Tony Blair not talking about Iraq in front of party workers at Labour's HQ.</p> <p>\"Very much a forward-looking speech, with no great surprises. He said a lot of things are coming down the track in the next six months, but didn't provide us with any detail. But the message is clear (and it's very much Mr Blair's personal message): we can't afford to fight this election on our record - people are looking to the future, not the past. </p> <p>\"It's no good just attacking the Tories, he said, and it's especially important that we keep pressing hard on policy while they flounder.</p> <p>\"The passage I marked with a star was this: \"The key test of any policy decision should be: does it advance and improve the lives of Britain's hard-working families in the future? Does it provide opportunity and security for them in a world of change?\" </p> <p>\"He didn't say there was going to be an election next year, but he said nothing to discourage it. He did say that since 1997 Labour has created economic stability, high employment, restored the public services after years of underfunding, and introduced devolution, the Human Rights Act, the Freedom of Information Act (although I noted that they still haven't implemented that one properly), and of course an elected mayor for London.</p> <p>\"Then he said there are seven key challenges facing Britain in the future - expanding economic and educational opportunity; personalised public services which meet the high expectations that people now have; tackling poverty; a tough law and order policy which balances discipline with civil liberties; promoting retirement as an 'opportunity, not as a threat'; promoting a tolerant, multicultural society while resisting extremism and tackling abuse of our asylum and immigration systems; and, finally, international support for the things we need to do in an interdependent world, for example on climate change and Africa. He's making a speech on climate change in a few days time and is going to make Africa one of his big themes.</p> <p>\"Well, that all sounds like motherhood and apple pie, and I think Mr Blair is probably dimly aware of that. He set out a number of areas where we can expect policy announcements in the next few months: everything from red tape and help for first-time homebuyers, to childcare, the new serious and organised crime squad, and even our old friend ID cards.\"</p> <p>\"Britain is getting better, he said. But it can be better still.\"</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Thanks for the many replies to last week's question about \"the bear in the woods\". \"Was it Theodore Roosevelt in 1902-ish?\" asks one reader.

We're talking about a peril threatening America. \"The candidate bracing himself to battle a bear, which may or may not have been there, was Ronald Reagan in 1984,\" writes this week's winner, Anthony Glazebrook. \"His weapon of choice might well have been a Pershing II nuclear missile - based in Germany to be effective against any potential Russian bears. Alternatively, a tooled-up bear could have been defeated by an Interceptor missile launched from space. This was to have been the linchpin of the planned Strategic Defense Initiative, aka Star Wars.\" Thanks for that, and to the readers who named the \"pre-neo-con marketing executive\", Hal Riney, who was responsible for the bear and for Reagan's seminal \"It's Morning in America\" ad spot. \"The bear/woods analogy was unhappily reminiscent of Donald Rumsfeld's 'known unknowns' speech, I thought,\" writes Neil Austin.

So cannot be stripped of it. A baronetcy is a hereditary knighthood, and is not 'strange' but has fallen pretty well into disuse of late,\" writes Reg, who does not supply his title. \"Surely you well-educated people should know these things.\" No doubt the Backbencher should, Reg, but she hadn't bothered to consult Debrett's. Had she done so, she would have discovered the decidedly ignoble truth: that baronets like Sir Mark are lesser men than peers. \"The revival of the order can be dated to Sir Robert Cotton's discovery in the late 16th or early 17th century of William de la Pole's patent (issued in the 13th year of Edward III's reign),\" explains the guide to the \"People of Today\", \"conferring upon him the dignity of a baronet in return for a sum of money.\" How very apt, then, that Lady Thatcher should have stumped up Sir Mark's bail today in order to salvage his dignity. </p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; AMERIKAN DREAM</b></p> <p>Ahnuld's Amerika <a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=3413\" target=\"_NEW\">Terminating Terrorism speech last night</a> was remarkable in many ways.

  "<p>The British journalist detained by the Israeli authorities for 21 days on the grounds that she might be \"used\" by terrorists, is due to arrive in the UK tonight after dropping a supreme court appeal against her deportation.</p> <p>Ewa Jasiewicz, a correspondent for the leftwing magazine Red Pepper, was detained when she arrived at Tel Aviv Airport three weeks ago. </p> <p>She was put on a London-bound flight by the Israeli authorities after she dropped a final supreme court appeal she hoped would allow her into Israel and the occupied territories.</p> <p>Her lawyer, Yael Barda, said she had dropped the case fearing an unsuccessful ruling might set a legal precedent making it more difficult for other foreign journalists to enter Israel and its disputed territories.</p> <p>\"She went to the supreme court hoping the judge would offer a critique of the evidence offered by the secret service, which we have still not seen, and that didn't happen,\" Ms Barda told MediaGuardian.co.uk.</p> <p>\"At one stage it looked like she might be allowed to enter Israel but not the occupied territories, which she would not have accepted. </p> <p>\"Because there is no further possibility of appeal we wanted to avoid a ruling, which under Israeli law, would have passed into common law. We were very wary that such a decision would hurt the chances of other journalists getting into and reporting from, the occupied territories so we released the appeal.\"</p> <p>Ms Barda described the decision as a \"big blow\" but said that, in conjunction with the NUJ and the International Federation of Journalists, she was planning to put in a request for the Israeli government to release the evidence provided by the secret service.</p> <p>News of Jaseiwicz's deportation came as the NUJ was meeting Israel's ambassador in London, Zvi Heifetz to campaign for her right to report from the country.</p> <p>Earlier NUJ national organiser for freelances, John Toner, said the decision to prevent her entry into Israel could not be justified on security grounds.</p> <p>\"The Israeli courts have accepted the she poses no security threat, yet a judge has ruled that her political views make such a threat 'within the realm of reason'. </p> <p>\"It does look as if she is being denied entry because they don't like her political views.\" </p> <p>When she was in Israel two years ago Jasiewicz witnessed the killing of Baha al-Bahesh, a 14-year-old Palestinian boy who was shot by members of the Israeli defence force.

  "<p>A judge at the Old Bailey today threw out corporate manslaughter charges against Railtrack, the former infrastructure company, and its former chief executive, Gerald Corbett, over the Hatfield train crash.</p> <p>Mr Justice Mackay ruled that the charges against Railtrack, now named Network Rail, and three of the company executives - Mr Corbett, Charles Pollard and Christopher Leah - should be dropped ahead of the full trial scheduled for October 4. </p> <p>But Balfour Beatty, the rail maintenance firm, and several of its executives at the time of the crash in which four people died, still face various charges of manslaughter due to gross negligence and offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act. </p> <p>Lawyers acting for Mr Corbett said: \"The charge brought against Gerald Corbett relating to the Hatfield rail crash has been dismissed on the grounds that the evidence against him would not be sufficient for a jury properly to convict him. The judge held that there was no evidence that Gerald Corbett had consented or connived in any offence allegedly committed by Railtrack.\"</p> <p>More than 120 people were injured in October 2000, when a GNER train careered off the track. Investigators concluded that the crash was caused by a broken rail. </p> <p>Six people were charged with manslaughter: Charles Pollard, Alistair Cook, Sean Fugill, Anthony Walker, Nicholas Jeffries and Keith Lea. The six accused of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act were Mr Corbett, Mr Leah, Stephen Huxley, Kenneth Hedley, Vernon Bullen, and Keith Hughes. </p> <p>Reacting to the quashing of the charges, Louise Christian, who represents one of the Hatfield victims and also acts for those involved in other recent rail accidents, said: \"The Hatfield victims will be absolutely devastated.\" </p> <p>She went on: \"They will feel incredibly let down and the victims of the (1999) Paddington crash, who are waiting to see if charges will be brought in their case, will also be worried now.\" </p> <p>Under present law, it is extremely difficult to prosecute big firms and the directors working for them. There was considerable doubt that the Crown Prosecution Service would be successful in the Hatfield case. When it comes to safety at work, directors have no legal obligations. Technically, safety issues are the responsibility of the company. But prosecutors face a Catch-22 situation in trying to get legal redress against negligent companies as firms can only be prosecuted if a director or senior manager is prosecuted. If no charges can be pinned on a particular director, the company is likely to escape a successful prosecution.</p> <p>It has emerged since the Hatfield crash that executives at Railtrack and Balfour Beatty were aware for 10 months that a piece of track that was to derail the high-speed GNER train bound for Leeds was broken. </p> <p>Just 18 months earlier, a report by management consultancy Booz Allen and Hamilton said that track renewals in the UK were carried out less than half as quickly than in Europe, and more slowly than estimates by Railtrack, then in charge of track and network. </p> <p>In its last two election manifestos Labour pledged to introduce a new law on corporate killing to make it easier to prosecute negligent firms. But the government has yet to convert that promise into legislation.</p>",
  "<p>ENGLISH FOOTBALL: ABOUT TO GET WOOD?</p> <p>Whenever the Fiver has the misfortune to watch football in the pub, there's a 50/50 chance that a) we'll be stuck next to a Sloane who's more toothy than Shergar, and b) that said Sloane, having jumped on the Premiership bandwagon post-Euro 96, will spend the game tediously braying about his knowledge of 'soccer'. Which brings us neatly onto Clive Woodward, who, having announced his resignation as England's rugby union boss, has set his sights on our national game!</p> <p>\"My whole background is in football,\" explained a sheepish Woodward today, picking up an Adidas Roteiro and sending a huge garryowen deep into the 22. \"I love football and I go to as many games as I possibly can. I never had that passion for rugby I have for football. I never got into rugby in the same way.\" Which, if true, is quite a statement: for Woodward's obsession with union puts Elizabeth Taylor to shame.</p> <p>And Woodward, who was sent to a rugby-playing school by his father, wasn't finished there. Indeed, he was soon milking his assets like a particularly thirsty Swiss dairy farmer. \"I was forced into playing rugby because that's the only game the school played,\" he sobbed. \"And I hated it. I ran away a couple of times because of football. I didn't mind being at boarding school. I just hated not playing football.\"</p> <p>Still, surely no Premiership chairman would give Woodward a job quite yet would they? Er, what's that Rupert? \"Sir Clive's expressed an interest in getting into football and has looked at our academy and other aspects of the club,\" explained the Southampton chairman. \"If we can learn from him about motivation, improving individuals and becoming world-class, then great.

But first there was today's token press conference, in which Sir Alex Ferguson revealed he didn't want Rooney in the first place!</p> <p>Well, kind of. \"If Newcastle had not come in [for the lardy loverat], we would not be here today,\" said Ferguson, giddily Morris Dancing on a mock grave inscribed 'Freddy Shepherd'. \"We could not afford to miss him.\" That despite Rooney's ongoing metaphysical injury. \"It's two or three weeks hopefully,\" Ferguson said, crossing his fingers like a once-great manager who now finds most circumstances inexplicably beyond his control.</p> <p>\"He's trained this morning, but we'll be better placed tomorrow.\" Not by our calculations, Sir Alex.

  "The scramble for the law and order policy ticket at the next general election continued today, with Michael Howard following in Tony Blair's footsteps and holding a walkabout to discuss crime and policing. <p>The Conservative leader took to the streets of Hove to reiterate his party's opposition to making the police document each stop they make.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Blair went walkabout in Harlow, Essex, to sell the virtues of his government's anti-social behaviour orders.</p> <p>Both trips show the importance the big two parties attach to being seen as tough on crime ahead of a likely election next year. Mr Howard said that political correctness and red tape are standing in the way of police officers doing their jobs - but admitted that Asbos were one way to help tackle crime.</p> <p>He spoke during a 30-minute walkabout in Hove, Sussex, where local traders claimed they never see police on the streets, and where vandalism and burglaries have increased. </p> <p>After meeting shopkeepers, Mr Howard pledged to fund \"several hundred\" extra officers for Sussex alone through his party's proposed asylum policies. </p> <p>He labelled government plans to ask police officers to fill out forms whenever they stop someone in the street as \"absurd\". </p> <p>\"We are told it will take seven minutes on average for a police officer to fill in the forms, and we are not talking about stop and search here,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We are talking about every time a police officer simply stops someone in the street and says 'what are doing here and where do you live?'. </p> <p>\"It's absurd and it's a very good example of the kind of political correctness and paperwork that is stopping officers doing their jobs.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard visited the Hangleton area of Hove, where a byelection is planned for October 7, as part of a day-long trip to Sussex. </p> <p>Local community association leader David Smart said a Range Rover had been driven through the front of one local off-licence, the public toilets had been shut for months due to vandalism and several shop windows had been broken. </p> <p>Mr Smart, 68, a retired policeman, said: \"What we need up here is a permanent CCTV camera pointing at all the shops. East Brighton has millions to spend on CCTV but we get the scraps. </p> <p>\"And we never see any real police officers. We get a few Community Support Officers who are dressed to look like police officers but they have no powers.\" </p> <p>Grocer Garry Sanders, 47, said: \"My front window was broken and the day it was re-fitted it was broken again. Every time it happens, my insurance premium goes up.\" </p> <p>And Nick Hollick, 32, owner of Stadium Motor Spares, told Mr Howard: \"We never see any police up here now. We had a temporary CCTV camera for three months and it made a real difference but it went. </p> <p>\"We used to go out to meet customers but now we are afraid of leaving the store unattended. It's got worse, definitely.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, during a walkabout in Harlow, Essex, Tony Blair hailed the increased use of measures to tackle anti-social behaviour as \"immensely positive\", saying Asbos were a key tool in the battle. </p> <p>The number of Asbos issued in Brighton and Hove has doubled in recent months, Home Office figures show, reflected a national trend. </p> <p>Between April 1999 and March 2003, nine were issued, compared to 18 between April 2003 and March this year, giving a total of 27. </p> <p>But today Mr Howard said not enough Asbos had been handed out. \"Asbos can make a useful contribution but in the last five years we have only seen 2,500 handed out nationally,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Today I have learned that even in quiet places such as this there are real problems caused by hooligans which create a real fear of crime for shopkeepers and other people. </p> <p>\"We intend to save money through our asylum policies and we are going to recruit more police officers. We are going to stop the paperwork which prevents officers from doing their job.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scotland's first minister, Jack McConnell, has given his backing to calls for a total ban on smoking in the workplace following a visit to Ireland where a ban has been in place since April.</p> <p>On a fact-finding visit to Dublin yesterday, Mr McConnell said he was now convinced a ban north of the border would be \"enforceable, practical and desirable\".</p> <p>Previously sceptical of an outright ban, he said the Irish experience showed there were great benefits in such a move, indicating a ban could come into force in Scotland within 18 months.</p> <p>Any prohibition of workplace smoking would include a ban on smoking in pubs, hotels and restaurants, where workers are at higher risk. </p> <p>Mr McConnell's party, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats are committed under the terms of their coalition pact to take action against public smoking. But until yesterday Mr McConnell was thought to be veering towards a compromise, backed by hoteliers and publicans, to see the creation of obligatory non-smoking areas.</p> <p>A consultation by the executive on smoking in public areas ends at the end of September, and has so far attracted 22,000 responses. The first minister has committed himself to a decision by the end of the year, which could lead to legislation being enacted around the beginning of 2006.</p> <p>Ian Willmore, spokesman for anti-smoking campaigners Ash, said: \"It looks like Scotland is leading the way in the UK to bringing in a ban on smoking in the workplace.</p> <p>\"All credit to him for taking the trouble of travelling to Dublin and changing his mind when he found it works. What he was impressed by was that it was well-observed and required little enforcement because it was popular.\"</p> <p>Mr Willmore said there were about 700 premature deaths due to workplace exposure to smoke every year in Britain - three times the number of fatalities from industrial accidents.</p> <p>The UK health secretary, John Reid, is expected to unveil proposals on public smoking in a public health white paper, expected in November.</p> <p>\"We would urge him to introduce national legislation, not just giving councils the powers to institute bans if they wish,\" said Mr Willmore.</p> <p>Martin Couchman, deputy chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, the trade body representing hotels, said: \"Although we believe the voluntary approach is best we are realistic enough to see that society has changed and public opinion has changed.</p> <p>\"We are heartened that Mr McConnell is talking of Scotland-wide legislation because we believe that if it is left up to individual local authorities there will be chaos.\"</p>",
  "I thought it would be helpful at the end of the summer break to set out in some detail the challenge ahead as I see it. <p>The key to renewing our political support for the coming years is policy. We must set out, as we started to do in June and July, a compelling modern prospectus for the country to make it stronger, fairer and more prosperous. </p> <p>There is one key test that every policy decision should pass: does it, in practical terms, advance and improve the lives of Britain's hard-working families in the future? Does it help provide opportunity and security for them in a world of change? </p> <p>This responsibility to address the future clearly is ever more important to us as the Tories flounder, incapable of the bold renewal, top to bottom, their party needs. </p> <p>Only Labour is facing the future with confidence. While others peddle the politics of pessimism and anxiety, Labour is forging ahead to build a Britain of all the talents, rooted in the values of opportunity, responsibility and fairness we share with the British people. </p> <p>Some were surprised at the breadth and depth of the five year strategies we set out in June and July for health, education, transport and law and order. But there was no reason for surprise. Renewing our ideas and policies - focused on the future and its challenges - has been one of our constant preoccupations as a New Labour government. We had been working on these strategies for a year, and they grew out of the investment and reform programmes already being implemented with a fair measure of success in each of these areas. </p> <p>There is widespread recognition that these five year strategies offer an ambitious, credible and practical prospectus for transforming our essential public services. It will be the same with the further policy we announce in the coming months.</p> <p>They also owed a great deal to the Big Conversation - the consultation and discussion exercise which Labour began nearly a year ago in all of the major areas of policy. </p> <p>Since last November there have been more than 200 Big Conversation events with ministers and more than 40,000 submissions to the party. I myself have taken part in a dozen or more events, and virtually every minister and Labour MP has been engaged in this unprecedented dialogue between a government and the public it represents. This too will continue. </p> <p>In our first two terms, we have met and largely overcome four of the key challenges facing Britain in 1997: <br><b>\u00b7</b> Economic stability replacing boom and bust - the longest period of economic growth since the Second World War; <br><b>\u00b7</b> High employment replacing mass unemployment - now the highest levels of employment ever, underpinned by a minimum wage; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Properly funded public services replacing underfunded public services - steadily improving health and education, in place of services which could not cope; <br><b>\u00b7</b> A new constitutional settlement replacing an outdated, centralised system of government - devolution to Scotland and Wales, the Human Rights Act, Freedom of Information, a Mayor and assembly for London. </p> <p>We have a record we can be proud of. But the political battleground will not be a debate about past achievements. It will be a fight for the future: how to meet the challenges which face us as a country; how to extend opportunity and security to all hard-working families; how to build a society in which no-one is left out. </p> <p>This is the work to be done and the task ahead. We are now set to focus relentlessly on the 7 key challenges facing Britain in 2004: <br><b>\u00b7</b> expanding economic and educational opportunity for all in an era of rapid global change and intense competition - so that the opportunities opened up by advanced skills and qualifications, available just to a minority in the past, become available to a larger and larger majority; <br><b>\u00b7</b> personalising public services so that they meet the aspirations of each citizen, while remaining universal and equitable; <br><b>\u00b7</b> tackling the problems of poor families and deprived neighbourhoods when the majority are relatively well off and the great majority are in work; <br><b>\u00b7</b> pursuing the tough law and order policy people rightly expect, in an era where, also rightly, people are zealous about basic civil liberties; <br><b>\u00b7</b> promoting retirement as an opportunity and not a threat, while also providing properly for the increasing ageing population when private pension provision is under pressure and the taxpayer base remains constant or in relative decline; <br><b>\u00b7</b> promoting a tolerant multi-cultural society while resisting extremism and tackling abuse of our asylum and immigration systems; <br><b>\u00b7</b> building international support for the action we need in an interdependent world, for example on climate change and Africa. </p> <p>We have started to set out a way forward to meet these challenges. Our forward strategies for the NHS, secondary education and law and order - published before the summer break - showed how under a Labour government public services will become increasingly personalised and consumer-driven, yet also open to all and not dependent on wealth. </p> <p>In each part of the public services it is now possible to see a future that works, underpinned by steady extra investment, new facilities, new technology, and an expanded and reformed workforce. <br><b>\u00b7</b> In the NHS, guaranteed choice options to reduce waiting times and improve quality for patients; new hospital suppliers; new primary care services including NHS Direct and walk-in centres. <br><b>\u00b7</b> In education, a new system of independent specialist schools and academies, with basic standards of literacy and numeracy achieved nationwide and a massive extension of teaching assistants and information technology to improve teaching. <br><b>\u00b7</b> In the criminal justice system, a return to community policing with new police Community Support Officers and tough measures to deal with prolific offenders and tackle anti-social behaviour and other problems. </p> <p>But this is only the start. Over the coming six months we will publish forward policies in each of the following areas: <br><b>\u00b7</b> Business and enterprise, including cutting the burden of regulation for small businesses and keeping Britain at the forefront of innovation and science; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Housing, increasing the supply of new housing and giving more help to people to get on the housing ladder; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Vocational education, improving skill training and preparation for modern apprenticeships within secondary education for young people with aptitudes to pursue this route, matching the success with which we already prepare young people for university; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Childcare, setting out a roadmap to universally available under-fives and childcare provision over the next decade in order to give families more choice about how to combine the pressures of work and bringing up a family, to provide better for young children, and to tackle poverty more effectively; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Welfare, including reform in areas such as Housing Benefit and Incapacity Benefit; extending opportunity to the 3m economically inactive who are too often written off; and developing new areas of welfare provision to meet future demands; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Public health, supporting people to make choices that lead to longer healthier lives; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Climate change and Africa, which we will be placing at the heart of Britain's G8 and EU presidencies next year to build international support for tackling these crucial global issues which we cannot solve alone; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Organised crime, with major legislation to establish a new Serious Organised Crime Agency to take on, in particular, the evils of drug and people trafficking; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Asylum and immigration: how we build a tolerant, fair and outward-looking Britain whilst tackling abuses, and paving the way for ID cards; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Local government, decentralising more power including a new approach enabling neighbourhoods to help deal at first hand with the street-level issues of most concern to local people, particularly anti-social behaviour, activities for teenagers, and the problems of the worst estates; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Pensions: how to provide the security people need to plan for and enjoy their retirement, in the face of longer life expectancy, a much less static working environment, and pressure on existing sources of pension income. </p> <p>This is an ambitious agenda. Taken together with the policy already published, it will offer a full and compelling prospectus to address the seven challenges I set out. In each case, the policies will be New Labour. They will be courageous in addressing the future by modern policy means, with no hang-ups for example about partnership between the public, private and voluntary sectors as appropriate, or extending rights and responsibilities together. We will also be resolute in our values and our conviction that all, not an elite few, should benefit from the changes we make; that excellence and opportunity need not and cannot any longer be the preserve of a minority as we build a Britain of all the talents. </p> <p>This is not the time for caution in the face of future challenges - but for the boldness essential to renew Britain for the era of globalisation. Britain is getting better but we can be better still. The new policies we are setting out - on pensions, childcare, asylum, housing and many other areas, in addition to what we have already announced on heath, education and law and order - are the route map for that journey. </p> <p>Taken together, these policy proposals will make a practical difference to the lives of every individual and every family, showing how by our actions the country is not only fairer but the individual better off. Week by week, I and fellow ministers will set out this prospectus, focused on the priorities for which we were elected. That is our task ahead.</p>",
  "<p>Business channel CNBC Europe has resigned from ratings body Barb in a row over the fact that the measurement group does not measure ratings outside the home. </p> <p>CNBC, a joint venture between US broadcasting giant NBC and Dow Jones, has withdrawn from the official measurement system because it believes that Barb - the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board - underreports its ratings figures. </p> <p>Because Barb doesn't measure out of home viewing, CNBC argues that it disadvantages smaller niche channels, particularly those serving a business audience. It believes most of the channel's viewing takes place in hotel rooms, on trading floors and in offices. </p> <p>According to Barb, CNBC reaches just 0.1% of the viewing public in a week but figures from GFK, the rival body that has developed an electronic wristwatch that measures radio listening and TV viewing automatically, claim the channel reaches up to 3.8 million viewers a week. </p> <p>In an average week, GFK was recording 2.5 million viewers, and up to 3.8 million for big news events, while Barb was measuring 200,000. </p> <p>Barb, which is funded by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Five, BSkyB and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, only measures viewing in private households. </p> <p>It measures the viewing of a panel of around 5,000 viewers automatically via a black box under their TV. When a viewer enters a room with the television on, they are required to press a button on a special remote control handset to register their presence.</p> <p>A CNBC spokeswoman said that because it was a business focused channel with an upscale audience, its typical viewers were unlikely to be members of the Barb panel. </p> <p>\"Barb hasn't kept pace with digital developments and doesn't report the niche channels very well. We recognise that we're a special case and we're looking at other research methods to measure our viewing across Europe,\" she said. </p> <p>The row echoes the dispute between TalkSport's chief, Kelvin McKenzie, and radio measurement body Rajar over the way it measures ratings. </p> <p>He is taking the organisation to court, claiming it has cost him \u00a366m in advertising revenue by refusing to switch from a diary-based system of measurement to an electronic one. </p> <p>Rajar insists it is committed to changing to a new system but that it must take its time to ensure it makes the right move. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Jane, 33, is a local authority personnel officer who is responsible for a team of 10 staff. She earns \u00a328,000 and is a member of her professional organisation, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. But after 10 years in the same human resources (HR) department she feels stuck in a rut. How can she move on? </p> <p><strong>1</strong> A senior management role in a charity is a possibility for Jane. With her broad skills and experience, she could run the HR department of a small voluntary organisation, earning up to \u00a335,000. Her chartered membership is an asset because it reflects her commitment to her profession, and her public sector background puts her a step ahead of competitors from the private sector. </p> <p><strong>2</strong> If she wants to change employer but remain in the local authority sector, Jane could specialise in, for example, recruitment and retention. Her salary would stay the same, but she would be building up an expertise that she might find rewarding. Alternatively, she might climb the managerial ladder to become a senior HR manager responsible for several teams and earning about \u00a340,000. Competition for these few jobs is fierce. </p> <p><strong>3</strong> Becoming a self-employed HR consultant is a popular move for middle managers like Jane, provided she is prepared to relinquish the security of a staff job. If she signed up with a specialist HR recruitment agency that places consultants in the public and not-for-profit sectors, she could earn \u00a3300 a day or \u00a340,000 a year pro rata. Consultants are often hired to lead a specific project, such as introducing new working practices or carrying out a review of staff needs. </p> <p><strong>4</strong> The NHS has problems filling senior HR posts, so it is a good time for Jane to join the sector as an HR manager in a small acute trust or a primary care trust. Her lack of NHS experience is not a problem. Her public services background is an advantage as the NHS is similar in terms of trade union relations and terms and conditions of employment. The salary matches her present income but, with experience, she could work for a larger trust, earning around \u00a338,000. With her level of experience, there are more opportunities on offer in the NHS than in local authorities. </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Working as a conciliator for the Arbitration and Conciliation Service (Acas) might appeal to Jane. She would be given in-house training in conciliation skills, and although the posts are full time there are good opportunities for flexible working, including working from home as conciliators are not office based. Acas employs 300 conciliators around the country. The salary is \u00a323,000 outside London, and \u00a327,000 in the capital.</p>",
  "The former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic today told the war crimes tribunal in The Hague that the charges against him were \"a mutilation of justice\". <p>Mr Milosevic concluded his opening statement, which he began yesterday with a long and rambling speech, by saying that prosecutors had failed to prove any of the charges against him.</p> <p>The trial was \"a farce, pure and simple\", he said, adding: \"This indictment represents a sum of unscrupulous manipulation, lies, crippling of the law and an unjust presentation of the history.\"</p> <p>Mr Milosevic contested prosecution allegations that he had fanned Serbian nationalism and instigated a decade of Balkan wars. </p> <p>He said prosecutors, lacking evidence of specific crimes, had manufactured \"the unique concept of a joint criminal enterprise\" - the term the in the indictments referring to an alleged conspiracy to drive Muslims, Croats and other non-Serbs from areas designed for an expanded Serb state. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic told the court that \"in two years, you have not presented a shred of evidence\" to support the charges. </p> <p>He described his own role as striving for peace while protecting the Serbs. \"Our greatest wish was to establish peace,\" he said. Inside Serbia \"during all of those 10 years, there was no discrimination against anyone\", he added.</p> <p>Mr Milosevic accused the western powers in the NATO military alliance of intervening in Kosovo during a Serbian crackdown on the Kosovo Albanian population in 1999 in order to profit from the region's natural resources of cobalt, lead and nickel, as well as its power plants. </p> <p>He accused the former Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic of planning to wipe out the Serbs and create an Islamic state in Europe with the assistance of Middle Eastern fundamentalists. </p> <p>\"What they [UN prosecutors] fail to say is that the activities of the Serbian people were activities aimed at defence,\" he said. </p> <p>The court said it would tomorrow announce whether it would impose a defence counsel on Mr Milosevic, who has refused to yield his right to defend himself despite suffering repeated ill health which has delayed the trial by many months.</p> <p>Mr Milosevic, who was extradited to UN authorities in The Hague by Serbia in June 2001, faces 66 counts of war crimes allegedly committed in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo during the 90s. He could be jailed for life if convicted on any charge. </p> <p>Prosecutors accuse him of orchestrating or condoning murder, the destruction of towns and places of worship and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of people in an effort to create an ethnically pure \"greater Serbia\" by funding and arming Serbian uprisings in Croatia and Bosnia.</p>",

  "<p> <strong>Prologue</strong></p> <p> There was something different about the rain that night. I noticed it as I lay awake - a purposeful, remorseless drumming on the roof, as if determined to force its way into the house. It rained all night, the claustrophobic intensity of the downpour leaking insidiously into my dreams.</p> <p>The next day dawned bright and even warm, its weak autumnal sunshine driving away the uneasiness of the -previous night. But half a mile from my house, the Thames already looked very different. Instead of the usual slug- gish flow, the brown water was racing angrily by. Small whirlpools and eddies played in the strong current, and freshly-torn branches floated past.</p> <p>The wildlife too indicated that something was wrong: hundreds of earthworms, forced out of their holes by the water, were wriggling uselessly on the banks. Some of the lower watermeadows had been submerged by the rising river, and deep chalky puddles lined the towpath as I splashed through on my bike.</p> <p>It was almost as a challenge to the elements that I dragged a friend's kayak down to the riverbank, and - after a brief wobble of trepidation - launched myself into the water. The last thing I remember seeing, as I shot out into the strong current, was my bike propped against a -willow tree on the bank.</p> <p>As I sped downstream, it gradually dawned on me that I had made a mistake. I couldn't turn around without the risk of capsizing, and I didn't want to find myself flung into the water so close to the weir. I had already taken the right-hand fork at the island, under the 'Danger' sign that warned bigger boats away, and could hear the muffled roar of the rapids ahead.</p> <p>A few minutes later I could even smell the spray. I eased closer to the bank as the weir came into view, its ugly steel gates fully raised to let through the maximum volume of the swollen river. On the right bank, under a grove of poplars, was the grey concrete memorial to an Oxford University canoeing team who had lost their lives in the same spot almost a century before.</p> <p>As I should have known it would, the increasing current took me by surprise. I had aimed to pass opposite the weir by hugging the bank on the other side, and then continue on round to the main channel. But the tug was stronger now, and within a few seconds I was away from the bank and losing control. I tried to paddle backwards, but succeeded only in spinning round with a dangerous near--capsizing wobble. All the while the roaring waterfall moved inexorably closer.</p> <p>I dug the paddles in deeply, as if on a liquid treadmill. I pulled harder, gasping from both the exertion and the adrenalin, until the speed of my kayak began to gradually outpace the water flowing underneath.</p> <p>Nearing the bank again, I grabbed at an overhanging -willow branch. The whole thing snapped off - it's not called 'crack willow' for nothing - the surprise nearly catapulting me into the water. Instead I snatched at a handful of stinging nettles and thorny brambles, clinging to them with relief as I came in close to the bank and safety.</p> <p>For weeks afterwards the placid Thames became virtually unnavigable. Within hours of my ill-considered kayaking trip, much of the Botley and Abingdon roads - two of the principal traffic arteries leading into Oxford - were underwater. It didn't spill over from the river directly, but instead appeared spontaneously in low points along the road, -surging out from manhole covers and drains. In places the water was over a foot deep.</p> <p>Further towards the centre of town, Osney Island was also inundated: each house had sandbags across the front door, and small rivers were beginning to flow down some of the lower streets. On the other side of the road allotments were gradually disappearing under the muddy flood. Sightseers were savouring the unusual scene.</p> <p>A white-haired woman appeared on the towpath. 'It's all in the Bible,' she told me furtively, before scampering back behind her garden wall. 'This is the beginning of the end.'</p> <p>She wasn't the only one to feel something different in the air, that week back in autumn 2000. Radio phone-in shows echoed with a phrase that had been in the national sub-conscious for a long time, but which was now breaking out into the open: climate change. Long the preserve of only -scientists and environmental campaigners, the phrase began to reverberate in day-to-day conversations across the country. The British have always talked about the weather, but the weather was no longer behaving like it used to. Something was wrong.</p> <p>Even politicians showed signs of noticing it. Tony Blair flew to flooded areas in a helicopter, announcing to journalists his determination not just to improve flood defences but to 'tackle climate change at the international level', whatever that meant. Blair's deputy John Prescott paraded around in wellington boots, also looking suitably grim for the cameras. 'All these incidents of climate change are reminding everyone, wherever they are in developed or developing countries, that this affects us all,' he lectured sternly, hiding from the bucketing rain under a temporary shelter of reporters' umbrellas.</p> <p>As the rain poured down, the political climate was -changing too.</p> <p>Not being a scientist, I didn't know much about global warming, but I did know some of the basic facts. I knew that the Earth had warmed by over half a degree centigrade during the twentieth century. I knew that the rate of warming had doubled since the 1970s. And I knew that eight of the warmest years on record had occurred since 1990.</p> <p>I understood the underlying science which explained why this was happening: that every year six billion tonnes of the 'greenhouse gas' carbon dioxide pour into the atmosphere, and that this comes from familiar sources like car exhausts, power-station chimneys, domestic boilers and the destruction of forests. I knew that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen by a third since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and that those of another greenhouse gas, methane, had doubled. The science explained that these gases acted like the glass on a greenhouse, -preventing the sun's heat from radiating back into space.</p> <p>But it was all a bit too abstract, and I found it difficult to connect to my everyday reality. Was this why I hadn't seen a decent snowfall in years? Did it explain the floods too? Was it the reason why the weather was suddenly so hot that spring?</p> <p>As part of my work at OneWorld.net - where I spent five years - I had covered Hurricane Mitch in Central America, droughts and famines in Africa and Asia, the -catastrophic floods in Mozambique and the killer -mudslides in Venezuela. Did all of this also connect up into a bigger picture of global warming? I suspected it might, but it was only a suspicion, more of an intuition than a -conclusion based on any firm evidence.</p> <p>Although I wasn't sure how climate change might fit into it, my concern about the environment was a long-standing preoccupation. I grew up in a country being rapidly destroyed by economic 'growth' and ever-increasing consumption. I saw my local shops in Oxford struggling and then closing down once big supermarkets opened on the outskirts of town. I saw pubs with real heritage turned into heritage theme pubs, and streets turned into elongated car parks. I saw rat runs and road rage, and I coughed in the fumes of my own car in motorway traffic jams on the way to work.</p> <p>Then, spurred into action like many others during the mid-1990s, I climbed trees and dug tunnels to try and stop the building of yet another road. I loved the tall trees, the clear streams and the shaded wild garlic meadows, and something inside me snapped every time I heard the chainsaws and saw the old oaks and beeches come crashing down. I'd grown up trusting that things would generally get better, and that 'progress' worked. Now I wasn't so sure. Even in itself the destruction seemed senseless - but what if it was presaging a wider destruction, giving birth to a -society which would poison itself for decades into the future as well?</p> <p>After the Newbury Bypass was completed, I drove through it, trying to recognise landmarks on either side of the open concrete wound. I saw it fill up with traffic, every car pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And I joined the activists' reunion on the day we blocked the road with a banner and hurled stones down onto the crisp new tarmac from the lifeless earthworks all around.</p> <p>But what if I'd been missing the bigger picture? What if the real Newbury Bypass tragedy wasn't just that a forest in Berkshire was destroyed, but that an island in the Pacific was drowned or a Nicaraguan family swept away in a flash flood? What if the local was the global after all? My work at OneWorld had given me an insight into the wider world, and I felt the connection, but it was a hazy picture.</p> <p>It wasn't long before I would start seeking answers. My journey had almost begun.</p> <p>I spent that Christmas at my parents' small farm in Llangybi, North Wales. It was still raining, and I had to complete the trip up the coast from Machynlleth by bus, because the railway track was cut by flooding (an increasingly frequent occurrence, according to the bus driver). On Christmas Eve my father and I spent the day stretching new fencing around one of the sheep fields, stabbing the rocky earth with a long iron bar to make holes for the wooden posts.</p> <p>On clear days there is a glorious panorama from Snowdon in the north down to Cadair Idris and even Pembrokeshire in the south, but we could see nothing, just mist and relentless soaking drizzle. Even the sheep looked miserable and bedraggled as they nibbled at the close-cropped grass. We worked almost in silence, pulling out muddy stones by hand and banging the posts in quickly before the narrow holes filled with water from the saturated ground.</p> <p>My mother had a fire blazing in the living-room stove when we came back in, and with my brother and sisters also having arrived we sat down for the customary family slideshow. My father set up the projector, whilst I moved a painting to make enough white space for the image. He'd selected slides of Peru, where the whole family had lived during his overseas geological posting between 1979 and 1982.</p> <p>The projector whirred, and there we all were, back in 1980 - my brother Richard, just a few weeks old, yelling in a pram outside the house; my little sister Suzanne looking startled in a flowery dress; my elder sister and I naked and tanned on a dark-sanded Pacific beach, building sand-castles; then all of us in the Peruvian Andes, the snowy peaks of the Cordillera Blanca towering behind us. I'd seen the pictures dozens of times, but I was still entranced. My father flicked on to a field trip he'd done the same year with his geologist colleagues into a place called Jacabamba.</p> <p>'That's my altitude record,' he commented gruffly, over a slide of a pristine snowfield, gleaming brilliant white in the tropical sun. 'Five thousand, two hundred metres.' The -projector whirred again, revealing an enormous fan-shaped glacier looming over a small lake. Icebergs were floating in it, having tumbled down from the glacier above. It was a spectacular sight.</p> <p>'What a place!' I breathed.</p> <p>'I loved it. Incredibly hard work, carrying drilling -equipment around to take rock samples, and then spend- ing freezing nights in those crappy old orange tents. But I loved it.'</p> <p>'It may not be the same now. I've heard that glacial retreat in the tropical Andes is pretty rapid.'</p> <p>'Perhaps. But that was a pretty big glacier. Once an -iceberg that calved off it into the lake created a huge set of waves which washed away half our equipment. There were ice avalanches coming down from above the whole time.' He paused. 'Still, maybe it has changed. I don't suppose I'll ever go back, but I wonder what it does look like now.'</p> <p>'I wonder . . .' I repeated slowly.</p> <p>Then I said nothing for a while. I'd just had an idea.</p> <p>That night, in many ways, marked the start of the journey described in this book. Over the next three years I would visit five continents, searching for the fingerprints of global warming. I would interview Mongolian herders, Alaskan Eskimos, Tuvaluan fishermen, American hurricane chasers and a whole army of scientists, all with an urgent story to tell. It was a story, when I first heard it, that left me both shocked and inspired: shocked, because of how few outsiders realised the magnitude of what was unfolding, and inspired because there was still time to avert a far greater catastrophe.</p> <p>This global quest wouldn't be easy, and at one point it would almost cost me my life. But at the end of it all I knew I would return to Wales with a box of slides. I would draw the curtains. I would set up the projector. And then I would answer my father's question.</p> <p>Copyright \u00a9 Mark Lynas, 2004. All rights reserved. No reproduction without permission </p>",
  "<p>Cambridge has risen to third place in an international league table of research universities, with Oxford going up one place to eighth.</p> <p>Harvard and Stanford were ranked first and second again. American institutions, both public and private, dominate the annual table, published by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, which looks at the influence of academics' research publications and the number of Nobel prize winners on the staff.</p> <p>For 2004, the compilers have included the Field Medal for mathematics in their calculations and the number of Nobel laureates an institution has educated as students. This seems to have boosted Cambridge's ranking from fifth last year at the expense of its American partner, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the California Institute of Technology.</p> <p>UK universities do well compared with their competitors in Europe, although this year the two big London institutions have slipped - Imperial College from 17 to 23 and University College London from 20 to 25. Edinburgh is ranked 47 (43 in 2003).</p> <p>On the continent, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, is the highest ranked at 27, followed by the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands at 39, the University of Paris 6 at 41, the Technical University Munich at 45 and the Karolinska Institute Stockholm at 46.</p> <p>Japan has two institutions in the top 40 - Tokyo at 14 and Kyoto, which leapt from 30 to 21 - and Canada two - Toronto at 24 and the University of British Columbia at 36. But the table confirms American strength in depth when it comes to research.</p> <p>The compilers at Shanghai Jiao Tong admit their methodology favours science at the expense of social science or humanities research. \"We tried really hard but were not successful in finding special criteria and internationally comparable data for social sciences and humanities. Many well-known institutions that specialise in humanities and social sciences are missing from our list, or their ranks are relatively low,\" concedes their website. </p> <p>The main criteria for the rankings are the number of Nobel or Field Medal winners on staff, researchers who are highly cited by other academics in their fields in 21 broad subject areas and publications in the journals Nature and Science. The compilers also used the science citation index and the social sciences citation index, which record how many times an article is cited by other academics in recognised journals - on the assumption that an influential paper will be cited more often.</p> <p>Shanghai Jiao Tong, founded in 1896, is one of the oldest universities in China and claims to have a \"good number of famous scientists and professors\", including 22 members of the academies of science and engineering. It is the alma mater of Jiang Zemin, the former president and current head of the military.</p> <p>Commenting on the table, a Cambridge University spokesman said: \"As a collegiate university, we consider our teaching and research to be world-class, leading the UK and Europe. When you put this league table against others, Cambridge is at or near the top in all of them; demonstrating our international competitiveness.</p> <p>\"What interests us is how we are going to remain world-class in teaching and research. Cambridge faces many challenges ahead, but there is no doubt that we are committed to attracting the brightest and best, regardless of their background or financial situation.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Mutants [An introduction]</strong></p> <p>We had heard that a monster had been born at Ravenna, of which a drawing was sent here; it had a horn on its head, straight up like a sword, and instead of arms it had two wings like a bat's, and the height of its breasts it had a fio [Y-shaped mark] on one side and a cross on the other, and lower down at the waist, two serpents, and it was a hermaphrodite, and on the right knee it had an eye, and its left foot was like an eagle. I saw it painted, and anyone who wished could see this painting in Florence.</p> <p> It was March 1512, and a Florentine apothecary named Lucca Landucci was writing up his diary. He had much to write about. Northern Italy was engulfed by war. Maximillian of Germany and Louis XII of France were locked in combat with the Spanish, English and Pope Julius II for control of the Venetian Republic. City after city was ravaged as the armies traversed the campagna. Ravenna fell eighteen days after the monster's birth. 'It was evident,' wrote Landucci, 'what evil the monster had meant for them! It seems as if some great misfortune always befalls the city when such things are born.'</p> <p>Landucci had not actually seen the monster. It had been starved to death by order of Julius II, and Landucci's account is of a drawing that was on public display in Florence. That image was among the first of many. Printed woodcuts and engravings spread the news of the monster throughout Europe, and as they spread, the monster acquired a new, posthumous, existence. When it left Ravenna it had two legs; by the time it arrived in Paris it had only one. In some prints it had bat wings, in others they were more like a bird's; it had hermaphrodite genitalia or else a single large erection. It became mixed up with the images of another monster born in Florence in 1506, and then fused with a medieval icon of sinful humanity called 'Frau Welt' - a kind of bat-winged, single-legged Harpy who grasped the globe in her talons.</p> <p>As the monster travelled and mutated, it also accreted ever more complex layers of meaning. Italians took it as a warning of the horrors of war. The French, making more analytical effort, interpreted its horn as pride, its wings as mental frivolity and inconstancy, its lack of arms as the absence of good works, its raptor's foot as rapacity, and its deformed genitalia as sodomy - the usual Italian vices in other words. Some said that it was the child of a respectable married woman; others that it was the product of a union between a nun and a friar. All this allegorical freight makes it hard to know what the monster really was. But it seems likely that it was simply a child who was born with a severe, rare, but quite unmysterious genetic disorder. One can even hazard a guess at Roberts's syndrome, a deformity found in children who are born with an especially destructive mutation. That, at least, would account for the limb and genital anomalies, if not the two serpents on its waist and the supernumerary eye on its knee.</p> <p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, monsters were everywhere. Princes collected them; naturalists catalogued them; theologians turned them into religious propaganda. Scholars charted their occurrence and their significance in exquisitely illustrated books. In Germany, Conrad Lycosthenes produced his Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon (1557, later translated as The Doome, calling all men to judgement); from France came Pierre Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses (History of prodigies, 1560-82) and Ambroise Par\u00e9's Des monstres et prodiges (Monsters and prodigies, 1573). A little later, the Italians weigh in with Fortunio Liceti's De monstrorum natura caussis et differentiis (On the nature, causes and differences of monsters, 1616) and Ulisse Aldrovandi's Monstrorum historia (History of monsters, 1642).</p> <p>In an age in which religious feelings ran high, deformity was often taken as a mark of divine displeasure, or at least of a singularly bad time in the offing. Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses, which is especially rich in demonic creatures, has a fine account not only of the unfortunate Monster of Ravenna but also of the Monster of Cracow - an inexplicably deformed child who apparently entered the world in 1540 with barking dogs' heads mounted on its elbows, chest and knees and departed it four hours later declaiming 'Watch, the Lord Cometh.' Allegory was a sport at which Protestant scholars excelled. In 1523 Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon published a pamphlet in which they described a deformed 'Monk-Calf' born in Freiburg and another creature, possibly human, that had been fished out of the Tiber, and interpreted both, in vitriolic terms, as symbols of the Roman Church's corruption. Catholics responded by identifying the calf as Luther.</p> <p>By the late 1500s, a more scientific spirit sets in. In Des monstres, his engagingly eclectic compendium of nature's marvels, the Parisian surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 lists the possible causes of monsters. The first entry is 'The Wrath of God', but God's wrath now seems largely confined to people who have sex with animals (and so produce human-horse/goat/dog/sheep hybrids) or during menstruation (Leviticus disapproved). Luther's Monk-Calf also appears in Des monstres, but shorn of its anti-papal trappings. It is, instead, a monster of the 'imagination', that is, one caused by maternal impressions - the notion, prevalent in Par\u00e9's day and still in the late nineteenth century, that a pregnant woman can, by looking at an unsightly thing, cause deformity in her child. Like most of the other causes of deformity that Par\u00e9 proposes (too much or too little semen, narrow wombs, indecent posture), the theory of maternal impressions is simply wrong. But it is rational insofar that it does not appeal to supernatural agents, and Des monstres marks the presence of a new idea: that the causes of deformity must be sought in nature.</p> <p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century, teratology - literally, the 'science of monsters' - begins to leave the world of the medieval wonder-books behind. When Aldrovandi's Monstrorum historia was published posthumously in 1642, its mixture of the plausible (hairy people, giants, dwarfs and conjoined twins) and the fantastic (stories taken from Pliny of Cyclopes, Satyrs and Sciapodes) was already old-fashioned. Fortunio Liceti's treatise, published in 1616, is mostly about children with clearly recognisable abnormalities - as can be seen from the frontispiece where they are assembled in heraldic poses. True, they include a calf born with a man's head and, inevitably, the Monster of Ravenna. But even this most terrible of creatures is almost seraphic as it grasps the title-banner in its talons.</p> <p>There is a moment in time, a few decades around the civil war that racked seventeenth-century England, when the discovery of the natural world has a freshness and clarity that it seems to have lost since. When vigorous prose could sweep away the intellectual wreckage of antiquity and simple experiments could reveal beautiful new truths about nature. In Norfolk, the physician and polymath Sir Thomas Browne published his Pseudodoxia epidemica, or, enquiries into very many received tenents and commonly presumed truths (1646). In this strange and recondite book he investigated a host of popular superstitions: that the feathers of a dead kingfisher always indicate which way the wind is blowing, that the legs of badgers are shorter on one side than the other, that blacks were black because they were cursed, that there truly were no rainbows before the Flood - and concludes, in each case, that it isn't so. In another work, his Religio medici of 1642, he touches on monsters. There is, he writes, 'no deformity but in Monstrosity; wherein notwithstanding, there is a kind of Beauty. Nature so ingeniously contriving the irregular parts, as they become sometimes more remarkable than the principal Fabrick.' This is not precisely a statement of scientific naturalism, for Browne sees the works of nature - all of them, even the most deformed - as the works of God, and if they are the work of God then they cannot be repugnant. It is, in a few beautiful periods, a statement of tolerance in an intolerant age.</p> <p>At Oxford, William Harvey, having triumphantly demonstrated the circulation of the blood, was attempting to solve the problem of the generation of animals. In 1642, having declared for the King, Harvey retreated from the turmoil of civil war by studying the progress of chick embryos using the eggs of a hen that lived in Trinity College. The Italians Aldrovandi and Fabricius had already carried out similar studies, the former being the first to do so since Aristotle. But Harvey had greater ambitions. Charles I delighted in hunting the red deer that roamed, and still roam, the Royal Parks of England, and he allowed Harvey to dissect his victims. Harvey followed the progress of the deer embryo month by month, and left one of the loveliest descriptions of a mammalian foetus ever written. 'I saw long since a foetus,' he writes, 'the magnitude of a peascod cut out of the uterus of a doe, which was complete in all its members &amp; I showed this pretty spectacle to our late King and Queen. It did swim, trim and perfect, in such a kind of white, most transparent and crystalline moysture (as if it had been treasured up in some most clear glassie receptacle) about the bignesse of a pigeon's egge, and was invested with its proper coat.' The King apparently followed Harvey's investigations with great interest, and it is a poignant thought that when Charles I was executed, England lost a monarch with a taste for experimental embryology, a thing not likely to occur again soon.</p> <p>The frontispiece of Harvey's embryological treatise, De generatione animalium (1651), shows mighty Zeus seated upon an eagle, holding an egg in his hand from which all life emerges. The egg bears the slogan Ex Ovo Omnia - from the egg, all - and it is for this claim, that the generation of mammals and chickens and everything else is fundamentally alike, that the work is today mostly remembered, even though Harvey neither used the slogan himself nor proved its truth. Harvey has some things to say about monstrous births. He revives, and queries, Aristotle's claim that monstrous chickens are produced from eggs with two yolks. This may not seem to amount to much, but it was the expression of an idea, dormant for two millennia, that the causes of monstrosity are not just a matter for idle speculation of the sort that Par\u00e9 and Liceti dealt in, but are instead an experimentally tractable problem.</p> <p>It was, however, a contemporary of Harvey's who stated the true use of deformity to science - and did so with unflinching clarity. This was Francis Bacon. Sometime Lord Chancellor of England, Bacon comes down to us with a reputation as the chilliest of intellectuals. His ambition was to establish the principles by which the scientific inquiry of the natural world was to be conducted. In his Novum organum of 1620 Bacon begins by classifying natural history. There are, he says, three types of natural history: that which 'deals either with the Freedom of nature or with the Errors of nature or with the Bonds of nature; so that a good division we might make would be a history of Births, a history of Prodigious Births, and a history of Arts; the last of which we have also often called the Mechanical and the Experimental Art'. In other words, natural history can be divided into the study of normal nature, aberrant nature and nature manipulated by man. He then goes on to tell us how to proceed with the second part of this programme. 'We must make a collection or particular natural history of all the monsters and prodigious products of nature, of every novelty, rarity or abnormality.' Of course, Bacon is interested in collecting aberrant objects not for their own sake, but in order to understand the causes of their peculiarities. He does not say how to get at the causes - he simply trusts that science will one day provide the means.</p> <p>Bacon's recommendation that 'monsters and prodigious products' should be collected would not have startled any of his contemporaries. Princes such as Rudolf II and Frederick II of Austria had been assembling collections of marvels since the mid-1500s. Naturalists were at it too: Ulisse Aldrovandi had assembled no fewer than eighteen thousand specimens in his musem at Bologna. Bacon's proposal that the causes of oddities should be investigated was equally conventional. The depth of his thinking is, however, apparent when he turns to why we should concern ourselves with the causes of deformity. Bacon is not merely a physician with a physician's narrow interests. He is a philosopher with a philosopher's desire to know the nature of things. The critical passage is trenchant and lucid. We should, he says, study deviant instances 'For once a nature has been observed in its variations, and the reason for it has been made clear, it will be an easy matter to bring that nature by art to the point it reached by chance.' Centuries ahead of his time Bacon recognised that the pursuit of the causes of error is not an end in itself, but rather just a means. The monstrous, the strange, the deviant, or merely the different, he is saying, reveal the laws of nature. And once we know those laws, we can reconstruct the world as we wish.</p> <p>In a sense this book is an interim report on Bacon's project. It is not only about the human body as we might wish it to be, but as it is - replete with variety and error. Some of these varieties are the commonplace differences that give each of us our unique combinations of features and, as such, are a source of delight. Others are mere inconveniences that occupy the inter-tidal between the normal and the pathological. Yet others are the result of frank errors of development, that impair, sometimes grievously, the lives of those who have them, or simply kill them in early infancy. At the most extreme are deformities so acute that it is hardly possible to recognise those who bear them as being human at all.</p> <p>Bacon's recommendation, that we should collect what he called 'prodigious births', may seem distasteful. Our ostensible, often ostentatious, love of human diversity tends to run dry when diversity shades into deformity. To seek out, look at, much less speak about deformity brings us uncomfortably close to naive, gaping wonder (or, to put it less charitably, prurience), callous derision, or at best a taste for thoughtless acquisition. It suggests the menageries of princes, the circuses of P.T. Barnum, Tod Browning's film Freaks (1932), or simply the basements of museums in which exhibits designed for our forebears' apparently coarser sensibilities now languish.</p> <p>Yet the activity must not be confused with its objective. What were to Bacon 'monsters' and 'prodigious births' are to us just part of the spectrum of human form. In the last twenty years this spectrum has been sampled and studied as never before. Throughout the world, people with physiologies or physiognomies that are in some way or other unusual have been catalogued, photographed and pedigreed. They have been found in Botswana and Brazil, Baltimore and Berlin. Blood has been tapped from their veins and sent to laboratories for analysis. Their biographies, anonymous and reduced to the biological facts, fill scientific journals. They are, though they scarcely know it, the raw material for a vast biomedical enterprise, perhaps the greatest of our age, one in which tens of thousands of scientists are collectively engaged, and which has as its objective nothing less than the elucidation of the laws that make the human body.</p> <p>Most of these people have mutations - that is, deficiencies in particular genes. Mutations arise from errors made by the machinery that copies or repairs DNA. At the time of writing mutations that cause some of us to look, feel, or behave differently from almost everyone else have been found in more than a thousand genes. Some of these mutations delete or add entire stretches of chromosome. Others affect only a single nucleotide, a single building block of DNA. The physical nature and extent of the mutation is not, however, as important as its consequences. Inherited disorders are caused by mutations that alter the gene's DNA sequence so that the protein it encodes takes a different, usually defective form, or simply isn't produced at all. Mutations alter the meaning of the genes.</p> <p>Changing the meaning of a single gene can have extraordinarily far-flung effects on the genetic grammar of the body. There is a mutation that gives you red hair and also makes you fat. Another causes partial albinism, deafness, and fatal constipation. Yet another gives you short fingers and toes, and malformed genitals. In altering the meanings of genes, mutations give us a hint of what those genes meant to the body in the first place. They are collectively a Rosetta Stone that enables us to translate the hidden meanings of genes; they are virtual scalpels that slice through the genetic grammar and lay its logic bare.</p> <p>Interpreting the meaning of mutations requires the adoption of a reverse logic that is, at first, counter-intuitive. If a mutation causes a child to be born with no arms, then, although it is tempting to speak of a gene for 'armlessness', such a mutation is really evidence for a gene that helps ensure that most of us do have arms. This is because most mutations destroy meaning. In the idiolect of genetics, they are 'loss-of-function' mutations. A minority of mutations add meaning and are called 'gain-of-function'. When interpreting the meaning of a mutation it is important to know which of these you are dealing with. One way to tell is by seeing how they are inherited. Loss-of-function mutations tend to be recessive: they will only affect a child's body when it inherits defective copies of the gene from both its parents. Gain-of-function mutations tend to be dominant: a child need have only one copy of the gene in order to see its effects. This is not an invariable distinction (some dominantly inherited mutations are loss-of-function) but it is a good initial guide. Gain or loss, both kinds of mutations reveal something about the function of the genes that they affect, and in doing so, reveal a small part of the genetic grammar. Mutations reverse-engineer the body.</p> <p>Who, then, are the mutants? To say that the sequence of a particular gene shows a 'mutation', or to call the person who bears such a gene a 'mutant', is to make an invidious distinction. It is to imply, at the least, deviation from some ideal of perfection. Yet humans differ from each other in very many ways, and those differences are, at least in part, inherited. Who among us has the genome of genomes, the one by which all other genomes will be judged?</p> <p>The short answer is that no one does. Certainly the human genome, the one whose sequence was published in Nature on 15 February 2001, is not a standard; it is merely a composite of the genomes of an unknown number of unknown people. As such, it has no special claim to normality or perfection (nor did the scientists who promoted and executed this great enterprise ever claim as much for it). This arbitrariness does not diminish in the slightest degree the value of this genomic sequence; after all, the genomes of any two people are 99.9 per cent identical, so anyone's sequence reveals almost everything about everyone's. On the other hand, a genome nearly three thousand million base-pairs long implies a few million base-pairs that differ between any two people; and it is in those differences that the interest lies.</p> <p>If there is no such thing as a perfect or normal genome, can we find these qualities in a given gene? Perhaps. All of our thirty thousand genes show at least some variety. In the most recent generation of the world's inhabitants, each base-pair in the human genome mutated, on average, 240 times. Not all of these mutations change the meanings of genes or even strike genes at all. Some alter one of the vast tracts of the human genome that seem to be devoid of sense. Containing no genes that contribute to the grammar of the body, these regions are struck by mutation again and again; the scalpel slices but with no consequences to body or mind. Other mutations strike the coding regions of genes but do not materially alter the sequences of the proteins that they encode; these, too, are silent.</p> <p>Of the mutations that alter the meaning of genes, a small minority will be beneficial and will become, with time, more common. So common, in fact, that it is hardly fair to refer to them as 'mutations', and instead we call them 'variants' or, more technically, 'polymorphisms'. In Africa, the 32 polymorphism of the CCR5 gene is currently increasing in frequency because it confers resistance to human immunodeficiency virus and so to AIDS. This is something new, but many polymorphisms are ancient. They are the stuff from which human diversity is made. They give us variety in skin colour, height, weight and facial features, and they surely also give us at least some of our variety in temperament, intelligence, addictive habits. They may cause disease, but mostly the diseases of old age such as senile dementia and heart attacks.</p> <p>How common does a mutation have to be before it becomes a polymorphism? The answer is a bit arbitrary, but if a variant sequence has a global frequency of 1 per cent or more it is assumed that it cannot have caused much harm in its history, and may even have conferred some benefit to its carriers. By this criterion, at least one polymorphism has been detected in about 65 per cent of the human genes in which they have been sought, but some genes have dozens. This variety should not overwhelm us. Most human genes have one variant that is far more common than all others, and it is quite sensible to speak of that variant as being normal, albeit only in the statistical sense.</p> <p>Perfection is far more problematic. The only reason to say that one genetic variant is 'better' than another is if it confers greater reproductive success on those who bear it; that is, if it has a higher Darwinian fitness than other variants. It is likely that the most common variant is the best under most circumstances, but this cannot be proved, for the frequencies of gene variants are shaped by history, and what was best then need not be best either now or in the future. To prefer one polymorphism over another - or rather to prefer the way it surfaces in our looks - is merely to express a taste. By this I mean the sort of claim made by the great French naturalist George Leclerc Buffon when he asserted that, for their fair skin and black eyes, the women of the Caucasus Mountains were lovelier than all others. Or when Karen Blixen eulogised the beauty of the Masai morani. Recognition of, even a delight in, human genetic diversity does not, however, commit us to a thorough-going genetic relativism. Many of the mutations that batter our genomes do us harm by any criterion.</p> <p>Each new embryo has about a hundred mutations that its parents did not have. These new mutations are unique to a particular sperm or ovum, were acquired while these cells were in the parental gonads and were not present when the embryo's parents were themselves embryos. Of these hundred mutations, about four will alter the meaning of genes by changing the amino acid sequences of proteins. And of these four content-altering mutations, about three will be harmful. To be more precise, they will affect the ultimate reproductive success of the embryo, at least enough to ensure that, with time, natural selection will drive them to extinction.</p> <p>These are uncertain numbers: the fraction of deleterious mutations can only be estimated by indirect methods. But if they are at all correct, their implications are terrifying. They tell us that our health and happiness are being continually eroded by an unceasing supply of genetic error. But matters are worse than that. Not only are we each burdened with our own unique suite of harmful mutations, we also have to cope with those we inherited from our parents, and they from theirs, and so on. What is the total mutational burden on the average human being? The length of time that a given mutation will be passed down from one generation to the next depends on the severity of its effects. If we suppose that an average mutation has only a mildly deleterious effect upon reproductive success and so persists for a hundred generations, an estimate of three new mutations per generation yields the depressing conclusion that the average newly conceived human bears three hundred mutations that impair its health in some fashion. No one completely escapes this mutational storm. But - and this is necessarily true - we are not all equally subject to its force. Some of us, by chance, are born with an unusually large number of mildly deleterious mutations, while others are born with rather few. And some of us, by chance, are born with just one mutation of devastating effect where most of us are not. Who, then, are the mutants? There can be only one answer, and it is one that is consistent with our everyday experience of the normal and the pathological. We are all mutants. But some of us are more mutant than others.</p> <p>Copyright \u00a9 Armand Marie Leroi, 2004. All rights reserved. No reproduction without permission</p>",

  "<p> <strong>Hart Crane and Charlie Chaplin</strong></p> <p>It was just before two in the morning, and Hart Crane decided to go to bed. He hung his clothes neatly over the back of a chair and put on his pyjamas. He closed the notebook on the table, set the pen square on top of it, and picked up a volume of Elizabethan poetry to take with him to bed. There was a knock on the door. He looked at the clock, but he was glad that the evening suddenly promised an event. He opened the door. His good friend the critic and novelist Waldo Frank entered the room. Behind him came \"a most pleasant looking twinkling little man in a black derby\", as Crane wrote to his mother the next day. It was Charlie Chaplin. \"I was smiling into one of the most beautiful faces I ever expect to see,\" Crane continued. It wasn't difficult to persuade him to dress to go out. Frank, who was in a slightly bitter mood while he was waiting for his divorce to be finalised, said that Crane and Chaplin fell on each other \"a little like two animals, sort of licking each other's necks\".</p> <p>Chaplin was in town for the New York premiere of A Woman Of Paris, the first movie he'd directed without starring in it. It was the story of a country woman with a weak suitor whom she loved but who did not try very hard to marry her. She moved to Paris and was kept by a wealthy man, who eventually dropped her. Chaplin told an interviewer that he had noticed that, at the climactic moments of their lives, men and women try \"to hide their emotions\", so he had worked to keep the scenes understated - which was not, at the time, the Hollywood conception of acting. The subtlety of the film eventually inspired dozens of young directors, but that week Chaplin had been very anxious about how the audience would receive it.</p> <p>I know, Crane wrote to a friend, that it's sentimental in its way, but Chaplin's work is so powerful that \"sentimentality is made to transcend itself into a new kind of tragedy, eccentric, homely and brilliant\". After seeing Chaplin's most recent film, The Kid, about an abandoned baby, Crane had written the poem Chaplinesque, which started with an image of the Tramp, the endearing, delicate outsider who might equally have been the impoverished poet of 1923.</p> <p>The half-deserted streets in The Kid, though it was filmed in Los Angeles, came right out of Chaplin's London childhood. His mother was prone to mental illness, and there were periods when the family was very poor. His mother, a sometime music hall performer, had three sons by different men - she was married once, to Charles Chaplin Sr. Her third son was abruptly taken by his father Sydney and Charlie, though they had different fathers, were very close. Later, they were split up and placed in various orphanages and workhouses. One of the things the boys remembered loving best about being at home with their mother was how she used to stand at the window of their flat and watch the people going by on the street below. She could guess what was happening in their lives from the way they held their shoulders and how their shoes were polished sometimes she did wonderful little imitations of their gestures. The small Charlie studied how she did this, as the child who played \"the kid\" in his movie would later mimic him.</p> <p>Chaplin's perfect control of his face and gestures was part of how he became an English music hall star, which led, as it did for many British actors, to a contract in the new silent film industry in Los Angeles. Impersonation remained central to his art: it was also his method of directing. An actor who worked with him said that, demonstrating everyone's roles, Chaplin \"became a kind of dervish\". Afterwards, he \"reluctantly gave us back our parts. I felt that he would much rather have played all of them himself\".</p> <p>Crane had particular cause for recognising the emotional truth of The Kid. His own childhood, while not materially impoverished, had been, in some ways, similar. Crane, too, had a mother more attractive than reliable her demands on him were constant. She was forever involving him in her battles with his father and taking him out of school to go travelling. In the midst of his irregular high school education, the teenage Crane had been writing very good poems. He wrote his first published lyric about Oscar Wilde and was interested in all things to do with poetry. His mother, though impressed by his gifts as a poet, was always jealous of any interest that did not centre on her. When he moved to New York, she made it clear that she felt abandoned.</p> <p>Taking his courage in his hand, Crane had mailed a copy of Chaplinesque to its subject, who had, surprisingly, written back a nice letter about it. To Crane's immense gratification, Chaplin recalled the exchange and the poem on the evening they met. Chaplin later wrote in his autobiography that when he said to Crane that poetry was a \"love letter to the world\", Crane had replied, \"A very small world.\"</p> <p>Chaplin liked to think of himself as a solitary intellectual in Los Angeles, and was better satisfied by the company in New York, where he was careful to premiere his movies. But even in New York, he was isolated by his fame. The day after he met Crane, Chaplin went to hear David Lloyd George speak at City Hall and was embarrassed when people did not listen to Lloyd George because they were busy mobbing their favourite actor. Sometimes it felt as if he could only really talk to people in the middle of the night. On an ocean liner, he met Jean Cocteau and stayed up with him until daybreak Chaplin said they avoided each other for the rest of the trip. He could make a deep connection with another person almost instantly, but it was as if he felt that this depleted some part of himself, so that he would immediately withdraw what he had just as immediately given.</p> <p>He had come to know Waldo Frank after Frank had praised Chaplin in his book Our America. Through and around Frank, Chaplin was introduced to a number of prominent leftwing intellectuals, who were interested in shades and schools of socialism and communism. In 1923, the Russian revolution was only six years past and still seemed to offer heady possibilities for the working man.</p> <p>Crane's own struggle with poverty was ongoing his room was cold and his job at the J Walter Thompson advertising agency precarious. But he was never especially interested in politics - the Russian revolution had changed his world but slightly - and if he, Chaplin and Frank talked politics that night, he did not report it to his mother. To know Chaplin was not to know another leftwing intellectual, but a glamorous movie star. \"Charlie told us,\" Crane wrote to his mother with the pleasure of the insider, \"the complete Pola Negri story.\" Chaplin had recently been embroiled with the great Polish screen star the press had made continual reports on their engagement and its rupture. Chaplin had a series of unsuccessful marriages and affairs, often with young women of 16 or 17, to whom he was offhandedly cruel. It wasn't until he finally, at the age of 54, married the 18-year-old Oona O'Neill, daughter of Eugene, that he settled into a relatively happy relationship. Had he lived to read about this in the papers, the marriage would have amused Crane, who had known the bride's father quite well.</p> <p>That night, the three men talked until five. A Woman Of Paris had premiered three nights earlier, and been a great hit with the press. Chaplin, in relief and excitement, was very nearly manic for a number of days. He was playing out scenes for his next movie, which became The Gold Rush Chaplin was always glad of whatever listeners he could round up to help him refine his scenarios. Crane was sensitive to other people's enthusiasms, and didn't mind being in the audience at all. \"Stories (marvellous ones he knows!) told with such subtle mimicry that you rolled on the floor.\" He is \"radiant and healthy, wistful, gay and young. He is 35, but half his head is already grey.\"</p> <p>Crane told his mother with studied casualness that \"we (just Charlie &amp; I) are to have dinner together some night next week\". The meeting lifted his week up out of the ordinary and made him feel again that he was in the right place, that wonderful things would happen, that he would be able to write. He tried to convey something of this sense to his mother, who still urged him in nearly every letter to come home. Closing his letter, Crane took the risk of staking out a small territory of his own: \"I am very happy in the intense clarity of spirit that a man like Chaplin gives one . . . I have that spiritual honesty, Grace, and it's what makes me dear to the only people I care about.\"</p> <p>The dinner between the two didn't come off they never met again. Chaplin avoided Crane, or at least didn't respond when Crane tried to see him in California years later. Crane sent Chaplin his first book of poems, White Buildings, and in his memoirs 30 years after Crane's death Chaplin mentioned being glad to receive it. He was always gracious about the dead.</p> <p>But that evening, when they took their leave of Frank at five in the morning, got into a taxi, and went around to Crane's lodgings, perhaps Chaplin did think it would be nice to see the young poet with the dreamy eyes and square, intense face again.</p> <p>He studied him as he walked up to his door and fitted the key in the lock. He had watched the young man's gestures all evening. Crane flailed a little bit, he flung his arms about, and he threw back his head to laugh, but there was strength in him, something there to be pared down and used. Chaplin leaned forward to tell the cab driver that he'd like to go back to the Ritz. He leaned back in the seat, and smiled again at the thought of the scene he was planning.</p> <p><strong>Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston</strong></p> <p>Langston Hughes said that Zora Neale Hurston was the only person he knew who could stand on the corner of 135th Street and Lenox with a pair of callipers in her hand and persuade strangers to stop so she could measure their heads. She was studying at Columbia with the anthropologists Franz Boas and Melville Herskovits, who were gathering evidence to assert that, contrary to current belief, the shapes of people's heads and the racial characteristics of those shapes were not correlated with intelligence. Though some people on 135th Street said they were busy - it was 1926, and there was a lot going on - Hurston was a force, and she made you laugh somehow right away, and there was something about the way she asked</p> <p>Hughes and Hurston had met two years earlier, at a banquet for Harlem's newest literary magazine, Opportunity. They had each received more than one prize, with particular attention given to Hughes for his poem The Weary Blues and to Hurston for her story Spunk. Hughes was immediately taken with Hurston. She told stories from her hometown, Eatonville, Florida, the first incorporated black town in America and the first to have a black mayor. She used to hang around the front porch of Joe Clarke's store, listening to the men telling how the different races got their colours her father, the moderator of the South Florida Baptist Association, told wicked tales of pastors and congregations. After Hurston moved to Harlem, she told Hughes stories about travelling over the south with a Gilbert and Sullivan light-opera company. She seemed inexhaustible. In his autobiography The Big Sea, he wrote, \"Only to reach a wider audience, need she ever write books - because she is a perfect book of entertainment in herself.\"</p> <p>They were often at the same parties. They 'd go up to A'Lelia Walker's on 136th Street, where the parties were so crowded that if you got there late you couldn't get in the door. Sometimes, they went to the soirees of Jessie Fauset, literary editor at The Crisis magazine these were formal and less fun, as Fauset's nurturing support of many Harlem talents took the form of encouraging them to recite their poetry and to speak French besides, there was never much to drink.</p> <p>More often, they ran into each other at the writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten's, whose parties were the only ones outside Harlem to be reported regularly in the gossip column of Harlem's Inter-State Tattler. Hughes later described them as mixed, really mixed, half black, half white, everyone talking to everyone, with plenty to drink. At one such party the opera singer Marguerite D'Alvarez sang an aria and afterwards the blues singer Bessie Smith, not knowing who D'Alvarez was, went up to her and encouraged her not to give up singing.</p> <p>Hughes loved this story and, wanting to tell it correctly in his autobiography, wrote to Van Vechten for the precise details. Van Vechten replied: \"Bessie Smith's exact and baleful words after D'Alvarez had finished singing were, 'Don't let nobody tell you you can't sing.' Bessie arrived dead drunk at that party and had a FULL pint glass of straight gin when she got there. She sang with a cigarette in the corner of her mouth and she didn't hold it there with her fingers. Nor did she drop it. But she was in magnificent form and sang the Blues like a low-down Black Angel. I LOVED Bessie.\"</p> <p>With several friends, Hughes and Hurston decided to start a magazine, Fire!!. They wanted to shuck the Victorian aesthetic and middle-class aspirations for the race of Crisis's editor, WEB Du Bois they wanted to unload Alain Locke at Opportunity's highbrow art for art's sake, too. Also, they were angry about the reception of their friend Van Vechten's novel, Nigger Heaven. Although they loyally didn't say much in public, both thought the title a mistake. But Van Vechten liked to be outrageous, and he cared about the metaphor \"nigger heaven\" was the phrase used by Harlemites for the balconies where black people were allowed to sit in theatres. \"To Mr Van Vechten,\" Hughes felt obliged to explain in his autobiography, \"Harlem was like that, a segregated gallery in the theater, the only place where Negroes could see or stage their own show, and not a very satisfactory place at that, for in his novel Mr Van Vechten presents many of the problems of the Negroes of Harlem.\" Van Vechten's novel was careful about controversial issues, particularly the decision faced by light-skinned black men and women over whether or not to pass for white, a care obscured for most people by the incendiary title. Du Bois wrote in Crisis that the book was \"an affront to the hospitality of black folk and the intelligence of white\". On the other hand, Gertrude Stein wrote to Van Vechten that \"the first party . . . is one of your best parties and you know what I think of your parties\". Hughes and Hurston stuck by him. Van Vechten had neglected to clear permission for song lyrics quoted in Nigger Heaven, and Hughes overnight wrote new blues lyrics for later printings of the book.</p> <p>Fire!! launched in November 1926, and Hughes and Hurston decided to put in anything of shock value. So clearly was Du Bois its target that both Hughes and Hurston remembered that he \"roasted\" it in Crisis. But though he may have shuddered in private, in public Du Bois did nothing of the kind, confining himself to neutrally mentioning the magazine's existence in one line. In fact, Hurston and Hughes were two of the artists of the next generation who took Du Bois's charge of recognising the dignity and artistic accomplishments of the race most to heart. Du Bois had been among the first to claim for folk art, especially the blues, its right place as an American art form, and in the 1930s he, Hurston and Hughes all argued that black art couldn't come from the black middle class alone. He liked independent women and respected Hurston he thought some of her work \"beautiful\". And he had a special feeling for Hughes, who was five years older than his own son would have been if it had been conceivable for a white doctor to treat a black child in the middle of the night in Atlanta in 1899 and the boy had lived.</p> <p>In 1927, Hughes went to Mobile, Alabama, and \"No sooner had I got off the train than I ran into Zora Hurston, walking intently down the main street, looking just as if she was out to measure somebody's head for an anthropological treatise.\" This was the year of the great Mississippi flood, when thousands of black field-hand refugees were rounded up, put into work camps and given so little to eat that many died of starvation. Hurston had a car called Sassy Susie, and they decided to drive the back roads to New York together. (Hurston had been looking for folklore down every back road, but she wasn't yet collecting, as she some-times said, \"like a new broom\".) Once on the road, they stopped off in Macon, Georgia, to hear Smith sing. By coincidence, Smith was living in the same hotel, so they got to hear her quite a lot. \"The trouble with white folks singing blues,\" she told them, \"is that they can't get low down enough.\" Farther on, they tried their luck finding songs with a group of stevedores in Savannah, but they didn't get any new ones. Hughes remembered Hurston saying that, to get new material \"you had to live with people a long while, as a rule, before you might accidently [sic] some day hear them singing some song you never heard before, that maybe they had learned away off in the backwoods or remembered from childhood or were right then and there engaged in making up themselves\".</p> <p>They drew closer to each other, but Hughes was known for his romantic unavailability and may have been more interested in men than women, though he didn't say so they didn't become involved, but they began to talk about collaborating. When she went back to Eatonville the following year, their plans were much on her mind: \"Langston, Langston, this is going to be big . . . Remember I am new and we want to do this tremendous thing with all the fire that genius can bring. I need your hand.\"</p> <p>In the fall of 1929, they began to share a patron, the wealthy and eccentric Charlotte Osgood Mason, who liked the idea of her proteges living near each other in Westfield, New Jersey. Hurston was sorting through the stacks of folk material she had collected and, at the insistence of Mason, Hughes was trying to finish his novel, Not Without Laughter, with which he was never quite satisfied. He was aimless in part because he was not near the people he thought of as his own. People were sleeping in the streets, and Hughes and Hurston, who had struggled against poverty all their lives, were more comfortable than they'd ever been before, or would be after. Chauffeured cars picked them up, beautiful white bond paper was delivered to their houses, the typing services of college instructor Louise Thompson were liberally paid for.</p> <p>Mason had decided that black art, especially its connection to \"the primitive\", was the most important thing to support at that moment. Both Hughes and Hurston worshipped her, which seems to have been the attitude she expected, though this posture on the part of two of the most independent-minded American artists of the time was disconcerting to the people they knew. Both had lost their mothers at early ages - his went off with a new husband, hers died when she was 13. The two writers genuinely loved Mason, and when she eventually cut them off - for, more or less, failing to subordinate their work to her plans for them - they didn't know what to do with themselves. Hughes became bedridden with tonsilitis, problems with his teeth and nausea. Hurston was the more deeply affected, as, according to the terms of her agreement with Mason, much of her folklore collection belonged to her patron, a situation that delayed and complicated publication and damaged her career.</p> <p>Before these ruptures, though, in the spring of 1930, Hughes, Hurston and Thompson would get together and make themselves sick with laughter telling stories and trying to get up enough material for the script of the play they had decided to write. Hurston provided the tale itself, the colourful dialogue, the title, Mule Bone, and the background, a setting very like Joe Clarke's store. Hughes's job was to structure the narrative and to fill out and polish the writing. But something happened, something about which Hughes was always quiet and disingenuous and Hurston loud and disingenuous. He said she just decided to leave, and he didn't think much of it. She said he was disrespectful and was giving too much credit to Thompson, and she suggested that he was sleeping with Thompson.</p> <p>Hughes said he had to leave because he had to write when he wanted to write and not when he was told to and that he was very sorry. Hurston wrote to Mason, \"Langston is weak.\" She took the play with her and sent it to Van Vechten, explaining that she had rewritten it and that it was all her own work. Van Vechten, not knowing the whole story, passed it on to an agent, who sent it to a regional theatre company in Cleveland, whose director was an old friend of Hughes. There were soon lawyers involved. At one point, Hurston seemed to be coming around. Then she found out that Thompson had been in Cleveland at the same time as Hughes, and again threw a fit.</p> <p>Hughes, in one of his harsher moments, wrote to Van Vechten: \"She made such a scene as you can not possibly imagine, she pushed her hat back, bucked her eyes, ground her teeth, and shook manuscripts in my face, particularly the third act which she claims she wrote alone by herself while Miss Thompson and I were off doing Spanish together. (And the way she said Spanish meant something else.)\"</p> <p>Van Vechten told Hughes that Hurston had come to relate the story of the fight and had \"cried and carried on no end\". Eight years later, Hurston told the writer Arna Bontemps that she still woke up in the night, crying. Bontemps told Hughes that Hurston had said, \"The cross of her life is the fact that there has been a gulf between you and her.\" Hurston mentioned Hughes only once, in passing, in her autobiography, Dust Tracks On The Road. Hughes gave a brief summary of their friendship and falling-out in The Big Sea and, though she turned up in his fiction, didn't mention her name in print again.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, Hurston was startled to see herself in a story collection Hughes published in 1934, The Ways Of White Folks. The story was The Blues I'm Playing, about a black woman, a pianist, supported by a white patron. Hughes's pianist, Oceola, was playing for her patron and stopped in the midst of Ravel and started to play the blues. The patron, angered, asked if it was for this that she had spent thousands of dollars having the young woman trained: \"'No,' said Oceola simply. 'This is mine . . . Listen! . . . How sad and gay it is. Blue and happy - laughing and crying . . . How white like you and black like me . . . How much like a man . . . And how like a woman . . . Warm as Pete's mouth . . . These are the blues . . . I'm playing.'\"</p> <p><strong>Henry James and Mathew Brady</strong></p> <p>It was August, the attractions of the summer house had begun to wane, and Henry James Sr discovered that he had a bit of business at the New York Tribune - he had, pressingly, to see a gentleman about an idea. He kissed his wife and collected his small son, Henry Jr, and they took the ferry. Once they were under way, the senior James was seized with the happy thought of presenting Mrs James with a surprise, a daguerreotype of the two of them.</p> <p>It was 1854, the year Henry James turned 11, and the family was living on 14th Street, off Union Square. The little boy and his father spent a great deal of time walking around lower Manhattan. Henry Sr liked to walk - though he had lost a leg in a fire when he was 13 and had a wooden leg, and later a cork one - and Henry Jr liked very much to have his father to himself, away from the overshadowing presence of his always more brilliant older brother, William.</p> <p>Mathew Brady's studio at 359 Broadway was on the second floor, above Thompson's Dining Saloon, where the Jameses often went for ice cream, in those days a great delicacy, though they were known to eat it weekly . There were well over 100 daguerreotype shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and Brady's was among the most luxurious. His studio had velvet carpets, fine lace curtains, satin and gold on the walls, an immense chandelier, waiting areas with couches and marble-topped tables, great skylights that Brady had designed himself, and, hanging on the walls, daguerreotypes of generals and presidents, kings, queens and nobility.</p> <p>Like many photographers, Brady was also an inventor. Two years after the Jameses' sitting, Brady introduced his signature photographs, printed according to his own method on salted paper. The large and impressive \"Brady Imperials\" further established him as the American equivalent of a court painter. Over the course of his career, he photographed the Prince of Wales, Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, Abraham Lincoln many times and, with considerably more respect than they were often given, the delegations from the Sioux and Ute nations when they came east to sign a treaty in Washington in 1868.</p> <p>In 1850, Brady's daguerreotypes had been the basis of a book, A Gallery Of Illustrious Americans he was embarked on a project, at which he'd very nearly succeed, of photographing every well-known or influential American of his day. Henry Sr, who kept track of greatness with an avidity that was to seriously complicate his two eldest sons' sense of accomplishment, cannot possibly have avoided communicating to Henry Jr what it meant to be photographed by Brady.</p> <p>Brady himself might have made an impression on the future novelist, later so sensitive to masculine beauty. He had curly dark hair, a handsome profile, a goatee and spectacles for nearsightedness. He was too myopic to take his own photographs, and maintained a large staff of artists, operators and assistants. Yet there was no question that his photographs felt distinctively like Brady's work - his subjects consistently seemed more like themselves than did people in other photographs. His presence calmed his subjects and allowed them to settle into themselves, so that the depth of their experience was evident on their faces. The photographs had style, a quality to which Henry Jr was very nearly slave he sought it abroad all his life, and in America he deplored its lack.</p> <p>When the two Henry Jameses sat for their picture, the camera operator saw a delicate-featured little boy wearing a narrowly cut coat with a long row of nine bright buttons. His back was very straight he held his shoulders well. Nearly 60 years later, James remembered that he was thinking about a recent visit from William Makepeace Thackeray the initial moment of this encounter seems to have been burned into his memory. James stood in the hallway. The honoured guest had been installed in the parlour and called out to him, \"Come here, little boy, and show me your extraordinary jacket!\" James's coat, the one he always wore, had more buttons than the English jacket of the day. The family gathered around their visitor, watching the great novelist bending and scrutinising buttons. Thackeray lifted his eyebrows and remarked that, \"In England, were I to go there, I should be addressed as 'Buttons.' \" In his memoir, James added, \"My sense of the jacket became from that hour a heavy one.\"</p> <p>This would have been particularly painful as he longed for nothing so much as to go to England. He had become convinced that in Europe he would finally be at ease. When the daguerreotype was made, Henry Jr arrived at the studio without having had a chance to change the offending jacket. He waited for a long time, three or four minutes, with his head in the clamp used to keep subjects perfectly still while the exposure took, and, as he stood, had a moment of excruciating self-consciousness. It's perhaps not surprising that he remembered, all those years later, that he had thought about his buttons. And that he had felt with almost crushing clarity, standing there \"in Mr Brady's vise\", that he and his family were \"somehow queer \".</p> <p>James did, in fact, grow up to be rather more queer than otherwise, but at the time he meant his family was different. The Jameses had money, but they were of Irish descent, when all the \"good\" American families of their acquaintance had English origins. Henry Sr could be cruelly demanding of his children and was constantly taking them out of school, moving them to Europe and finding fault with their lives, teachers and ambitions. Henry Sr had been raised Protestant, but soon he would place his faith in the mystical religious philosophy of Emanuel Swedenborg.</p> <p>But it wasn't these distinctions, or not only these, that disturbed him as he leaned against his father's shoulder. In the moment of the photograph, he seems to have felt that they were different because they were American. And in this sense his self-consciousness presaged his lifelong struggle to define a place for an American artist in a world where history and taste belonged to Europe, a pursuit that would endear him to many of the American writers who followed him.</p> <p>James would live in England for nearly 40 years. Finally, out of despair at American isolationism during the first world war, he became an English citizen. After his parents died, he kept the image - a silver daguerreotype, disturbing in the ghostly aliveness of its subjects.

The film crew were shooting their latest opus in a plush Oslo apartment complex when gunfire erupted on the street below. </p> <p>Fortunately, the cameraman was able to tear himself away from the action long enough to film the action unfolding on the street outside. The hour-long tape was later turned in to Oslo police, who will presumably need to fast-forward through several scenes of bedroom antics in order to reach the all-important money shot.</p> <p>The robbery occurred on Monday at the Aker Brygge shopping complex on the Oslo waterfront. \"We heard a lot of noise outside and went to check,\" explained porn star Thomas \"Rocco\" Hansen. \"I saw a guard collapsing on to the ground and a guy running.\" Ever the professional, Hansen was later able to return to character and complete the day's shoot.</p> <p>\"The robbers were arrested with a significant amount of cash,\" admitted Hans Halvoren, the head of the Oslo police crime unit. \"We can't say how much yet, but it was a lot.\" But in what some might regard as a display of gross ingratitude, Halvoren conspiciously failed to pay tribute to the smut peddlers in the shadows.

  "They walk in slow procession across a field of summer flowers, through the scent of mint into the nightmare of their memories. They arrive this time as survivors, not prisoners. Or else they come to pay homage to dead relatives at this accursed place: the now disused iron ore mine at Omarska, in northwest Bosnia. In 1992 it was a concentration camp, the location of an orgy of killing, mutilation, beating and rape, prior to enforced deportation for those lucky enough to survive. The victims were Bosnian Muslims and some Croats; the perpetrators their Serbian neighbours. <p>They move, tentatively, on this day of commemoration among desolate, rust-coloured industrial buildings, haunted by what happened within them. Nusreta Sivac places a flower on each space of floor where her dead friends once slept in the quarters for women who \"served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, covered with blood\" - quarters just across a hallway from the now empty office where she was, like them, serially raped, night after night. And she passes the window from which she watched the slaughter of men on the tarmac below, day in, day out. </p> <p>Satko Mujagic knows that tarmac well: his two-year-old daughter now plays with a ball on the very spot where he had been too weak to line up for bread because of dysentery, and had to be supported by his father. Later, the child picks a daisy. \"You do this where your father lay bleeding,\" says one of the party. \"Being here gives me the feeling of understanding nothing,\" says Satko. \"The violence here was nothing to do with anything, not even war. It is unfathomable.\" </p> <p>Young Sehiba Jakupovic, her face contorted with grief, stares around the rooms in a building called the White House from which hardly anyone emerged alive; her husband Alem was among those who perished. \"I have a 12-year-old now,\" she says quietly, \"just a baby at the time.\" </p> <p>Nusreta tells the story of a family typical of Omarska and its legacy; one family among the thousands. \"It was the night of one of their saints, St Peter,\" she recalls. \"The guards were drunk and set tyres on fire, singing their songs and screaming as they took prisoners out to jump on them and beat them to death. One man, Becir Medunjanin, was being jumped upon, while his wife Sadeta watched from our quarters. She cried out, 'What are they doing to him?' and I tried to calm her lest she lost control and was taken out too. Sadeta was later killed as well. They had two sons; one had already been killed when they shelled the village - Sadeta always said that if she survived Omarska she would find his body to give it a proper burial. The other, Anes, survived Omarska, the only member of the family to live. He came with me just recently to identify Sadeta's body and gave his DNA. 'That is my mother,' he said.\" </p> <p>The date of this commemoration of the camp's closure - August 6 - is branded into these people's minds. And I have a stake in all this: for the closure of Omarska followed the day after the putrid afternoon of August 5 1992, on which it had been my accursed honour to find a way into this place, along with a crew from ITN. </p> <p>We saw little that day, but enough: terrified men emerging from a hangar, in various states of decay - some skeletal, heads shaven - and drilled across a tarmac yard, under the watchful eye of a machine-gun post, into a canteen where they wolfed down watery bean stew like famished dogs, skin folded like parchment over their bones. \"I do not want to tell any lies,\" said one prisoner, \"but I cannot tell the truth.\" And it is strange - traumatic, indeed - to stand again in that now empty canteen; strange to walk that tarmac killing ground. </p> <p>It is disturbing to wander these dread buildings - where inmates were held and beaten, and whence they were called to their death; buildings forbidden to us that day in 1992, our paths blocked by armed guards and the camp commander, Zjelko Meakic, now awaiting trial in the Hague. Disturbing also to see the so-called Red House, where prisoners' throats were cut. </p> <p>The feeling is all the more strange when I recognise a man I had met that day, in that same canteen: Sefer Haskic, who is now a joiner in Bolton, revisits the room into which he was crammed. \"I was trying to remember the people they killed,\" he says. \"All my friends. They would call out the names, and men would get up, leave us, and never come back. You could hear the screaming, the killing, you could smell burning tyres and dead bodies. Next morning, there would usually be about 30 of them: the yellow truck would arrive so that other prisoners could load them up and go to dig graves. The truck would always come back, but the men who loaded it usually not. I was forever waiting my turn, but it never came - I still can't believe I'm alive.\" Sefer remembers in particular a night of frenzied ferocity, during which some 150 men were killed, \"and the walls were covered with blood\". </p> <p>However, these people have not returned to Omarska only for remembrance; it is also a gesture of defiance. It was intended by the Bosnian Serbs - as has been affirmed at The Hague - that no Muslims (or rather Bosniaks - the secular ethnic term by which they are properly known) should remain on this territory alive; that they should all be deported or killed. But all around us now are the sights and sounds of a once unthinkable return by thousands of Bosniaks to the homes from which they were brutally expelled. They come back under the shadow and insignia of their persecutors, with whom they live cheek by jowl - for this is the so-called \"Republika Srpska\" granted to the Bosnian Serbs at Dayton in 1995. But they do so all the same. </p> <p>They return also to the village of Kozarac, the site of a savage attack on May 24 1992. It was emptied of all 25,000 Bosniak inhabitants. Every Muslim house was marked in paint for incineration; the surviving Muslims herded in droves over the mountains at gunpoint. But the place is now home to more than 6,000 Bosniak \"returnees\", who outnumber the Serbs as they did before, with an additional 15,000 visiting from the scattered diaspora for summer. Once again, minarets - blown apart by the Serbs - nestle, rebuilt, against the hillside. </p> <p>With much greater difficulty, people return also to the local seat of authority, Prijedor, where the persecutions were planned and whence orders for establishment of the camps, for the killing and mass deportation were given. In Prijedor returnees live under the cold stare of their erstwhile persecutors; but Kozarac is an effervescent, if peculiar, place. As families sit out to enjoy pizza and beer in the warm evening, so they recognise one another: a survivor of Omarska here, of another camp there, a bereaved father here, a widowed mother there. The entire community is a concentration camp survivors' reunion. Everyone here is damaged, but resilient. No life is unaffected by the maelstrom of violence. </p> <p>If there is a driving force behind the return to Kozarac, it is the quietly composed figure of Sabaduhin Garibovic, who runs the Concentration Camp Survivors' Association. \"We are doing this,\" he says, \"to show the Serbs who evicted us that they did not entirely succeed. That we can come back. They never thought they would see it. They cannot fathom what we are doing.\" </p> <p>Sabahudin's father survived Omarska, but his brother Armin was among the first to die there, his name called from among 156 men packed into the \"garage\", a space just five metres by six. There was no water: the men had to drink urine to live. It was so hot that the prisoners smashed an upper window to let in air, for which Armin and another man were murdered. Sabahudin himself is a survivor of Trnopolje, another camp we entered that day in 1992: \"I remember them taking out the girls to do what they would with them - six or so each night, including my niece.\" Trnopolje was the location for the enduring image of the war: the skeletal Fikret Alic and other prisoners behind barbed wire. </p> <p>\"Almost every day I see the people who did this to us,\" says Sabahudin. \"We live separate lives - there is nothing that unifies us with the Serbs. We rely on ourselves and each other to survive.\" Just before our meeting, a jubilant wedding motorcade passed through town, hooting and waving the old Bosnian wartime flag. In overwhelmingly Serbian Prijedor, it was pelted with bottles and rocks. Two weeks before, a bomb had been thrown at a Bosniak-owned bar in Kozarac; a Serbian former camp guard living near Omarska was beaten up by Bosniaks. There are countless such incidents. \"International foundations organise round tables to discuss living together,\" says Sabahudin, \"but it is empty talk, and the reasons are simple: we cannot forgive or forget what happened, and they either deny it happened or say they had to do it - they were obeying orders.\" </p> <p>Kozarac's economy depends almost entirely on the diaspora - on Omarska survivors such as Edin Kararic, who now works as a tanker driver based in Watford. Edin has managed to put some money into buying a cafe called Mustang on Kozarac's main drag, managed for him by a fellow survivor. \"They drove us out,\" says Edin, \"and we are buying it back. This cafe is my finger stuck up to the Serbs who did not want us here. In fact, that is what those minarets are, on the mosques that no one goes to: fingers stuck up at the Serbs. That is why we must come back to this place - why else would any of us want to, given what happened here? </p> <p>\"Mind you,\" he adds, pensively, \"it's difficult to enjoy yourself in a place where 7,000 people are missing from a population of 25,000.\" </p> <p>Emsuda Mujagic was among the first to come back to Kozarac, having been a refugee in Croatia. \"I wanted to see in the new millennium at home,\" she says, \"and so I came back on December 31 1999. Our house was one of the first to be destroyed in the shelling, but we rebuilt it slowly. There was literally nothing here. No birds, just snakes and a few Chetniks [slang for Serbs]. I have to stand up to their plan, which was to destroy not just a community but a whole people. That is the wish that has kept me going.\" </p> <p>Emsuda is a survivor of Trnopolje, and on the 12th anniversary of our discovery of the camp, she takes me back to what is now a school again, closed for summer. There, sitting on the steps, Esmuda recalls how each night \"the guards would just walk by and shoot or beat people while we slept in the open. Or else they would come into the women's and children's quarters with torches and read the names of young girls from a list, some as young as 10, 12 or 13. They would take them to a house where Serbian soldiers from the front would have their way with them. Some of the girls would come back, scarred and tortured - others would not, and we understood they had been tortured to death. One woman was breastfeeding her baby when they took her - she gave the child for safekeeping and came back horribly scarred.\" </p> <p>Nusreta, who struggled to come to terms with her ordeal in Omarska, steeled herself to return to Prijedor in July 2002. By way of welcome, she found the word \"Omarska\" scrawled across her doorway by her new neighbours. \"At first I thought I wouldn't be able to bear it,\" she says. \"I used to stay indoors, peeping through the curtains.\" </p> <p>There was always a macabre intimacy to Bosnia's war - people knew their torturers and murderers - and the intimacy remains. \"A lot of the Omarska guards live in my neighbourhood,\" says Nusreta. \"I see them almost every day. One of them, called Vokic, has his entrance in the next block of flats and we share a bedroom wall. I see the interrogators and even the man who ordered that I be put in Omarska - he's a bank manager and drives a Mercedes. I try to catch his eye, but he turns away. Another has been let out from prison in The Hague - called Kvocka. Last time I looked him in the eye was when he was in the dock and I was a witness. But I often see him on the street, even on the day we went to buy flowers for the burials of five women from Omarska whose bodies had been exhumed. There he was, in the florist buying flowers for his wife. I said to my friend: 'Look, Kvocka is standing behind you. On the day the dead are buried, and thousands more are dead, he walks free.'\" </p> <p>Nusreta, a former judge, returned not to her own apartment but to her brother's. Why? When she emerged alive from Omarska, she explains, she found a former typist from the bench called Ankica living in her flat, and was invited in for coffee. \"There I was, like someone gone mad,\" recalls Nusreta, \"straight from Omarska and a guest in my own flat. I sat down on my sofa. Ankica, wearing my clothes, made me coffee in my pot, served in the china my mother left me, and asked me: 'Why are you acting so strange?' She said the apartment suited her, she had always wanted one like this.\" </p> <p>Years later, Nusreta returned - as was her right under the Dayton peace plan - to be promised by Ankica that everything would be left in order. \"But when I finally evicted her,\" says Nusreta, \"it had all gone. Even the built-in wardrobe. Everything I had inherited from my mother. Even my photographs. It was pure spite, to wipe out my past.\" Thankfully, Nusreta has a few good friends in Prijedor, notably the only Bosniak doctor in town, Azra, whose elderly father and stepmother had their throats cut when they returned home after surviving Omarska in 1992. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I get a crisis in the night,\" says Nusreta, \"that someone may knock at the door or throw a brick through my window. But I will become happier in accordance with how many of our people come back. My only wish is that by us coming home, the Serbs do not get what they wanted.\" However, she says by way of conclusion, \"I can never again be happy.\" </p> <p>One hallmark of the aftermath of Bosnia's war is an almost complete lack of reckoning on the part of the Bosnian Serbs. Only one defendant - the former Bosnian Serb joint-president herself, Biljana Plavsic - has pleaded guilty at The Hague towhat happened, and appealed for reconciliation. But around Omarska, the returnees' narrative falls down a black hole in the perpetrators' memory. \"There was no camp here,\" security guards at the entrance to Omarska mine told us. \"It was all lies, Muslim lies, and forgery by the journalists.\" </p> <p>\"There is no remorse,\" says Nusreta. \"No one has apologised or even admitted what happened. They say they know nothing about the camps. There are 145 mass graves and hundreds of individual graves in this region, and we invite the local authorities to our commemorations, but they never come.\" \"Even now,\" says the Bosniak political leader in Prijedor, Muharem Murselovic, \"the Serbs will not accept that anything happened. I am always in a dilemma - are they crazy, or are they pretending to be crazy? I think it is because they were all so deeply involved in what was happening that they cannot come forward and admit it.\" </p> <p>\"Every time I see a Serb who is extremist,\" says Sabahudin, \"I remind him of what happened in front of their eyes. In such a way as I hope might change his viewpoint. He has to understand that if this country is to survive, they have to change their mind. Any future together is conditional upon them admitting what they did, and apologising for it.\" </p> <p>The security guards from the all-Serbian village of Omarska signal that it is time for the commemorative procession to leave the camp. But as we leave, there remains one urgent question, one burning uncertainty. </p> <p>Crucial to the reckoning of which Sabahudin speaks is the matter of the future of the site of camp Omarska. There is nothing to mark what happened here - the horrors are officially buried, hidden, denied. The Serbian local authorities are enthusiastically pursuing a plan to sell off the mine to overseas investors, which could result in the concealment of a mass grave, a monument to barbarity and suffering. The killing ground could become a car park. The physical memory of this evil but sacred ground could be obliterated. </p> <p>Bosniak expectations are modest, and quite possibly doomed. \"We would be pleased,\" says Sabahudin, \"if there could just be some kind of memorial, maybe that the White House might be fenced off. We just want something to ensure that the memory is preserved, and in the smallest way to awaken the conscience of the Serbs. That is the really important thing. Because if we don't awaken that conscience, we might as well forget everything. And that would be the saddest thing of all - to forget what happened and what could happen again tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow.\"</p>",

  "<p>Media and telecoms regulator Ofcom today heaped further pressure on BT in the row over its broadband pricing policy after ruling the company had infringed competition law. </p> <p>The long-running dispute dates back to a complaint made by rival internet service provider Freeserve to Oftel, Ofcom's predecessor as telecoms watchdog, in 2002. </p> <p>Freeserve, which has since changed its name to Wanadoo and is owned by France Telecom, complained that BT was selling its broadband service at a loss and taking advantage of the fact that it also owns and operates the telephone network. </p> <p>The complaint was originally thrown out by Oftel but Wanadoo took the case to an appeal tribunal that ruled in February last year that the regulator should reopen the case. </p> <p>And today Ofcom found the telecoms giant guilty of infringing section 18 of the Competition Act and said it had sent a statement of objections to BT. </p> <p>The company has the opportunity to make oral and written representations to the regulator's proposed decision before a final ruling is made. </p> <p>The decision comes at a sensitive time for BT. Last week Ofcom said it must further reduce the amount it proposes to charge rivals for access to the so-called \"local loop\" - the last mile of telephone wire between the exchange and the home. </p> <p>The UK is well behind other European countries in opening up the \"local loop\" to competition and Ofcom sees the acceleration of the process as crucial in encouraging broadband competition and encouraging the development of new services such as cheap voice calls and video-on-demand.</p> <p>Ofcom is also conducting a wholesale review of the telecoms market, which is due to be published at the end of the year, and has refused to rule out breaking up the company altogether to separate its wholesale and retail arms. </p> <p>While there are over 3 million UK broadband subscribers over BT's lines, plus a further 1.7 million through cable operators NTL and Telewest, the former monopoly's rivals continue to complain that BT is abusing its dominant position to corner the market. </p> <p>\"We were confident in this case and have no further comment to make,\" said Wanadoo. </p> <p>BT pointed out that the case was still ongoing. \"The case involves complex legal issues which will take time to resolve and we will continue to work with Ofcom over the coming months to bring this matter to an equitable conclusion,\" it said. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>A new generation of radio stations broadcasting for, and by, local communities are set to become reality as Ofcom invites applications for licences today.</p> <p>New legislation requires the low-cost local radio licences to be handed out to groups interested in broadcasting to small areas, with about a 5km (three-mile) radius, on a not-for-profit basis and for local social benefit.</p> <p>The licences are being offered on either the FM or AM wavebands and across most of the UK. </p> <p>Ofcom is not specifying where the new community radio stations should be - like it does with commercial radio licences - but is it is inviting applicants to say where they want a station and why.</p> <p>It is expected that the move will encourage some pirate radio stations to turn 'legitimate'.</p> <p>The regulator's enforcement officers may even leave application packs for the new community licences at pirate stations when they are raided. </p> <p>But applications are open to anyone, not just pirates or people with previous broadcasting experience.</p> <p>A non-refundable charge of \u00a3600 will be made for each application, whether or not a licence is granted. </p> <p>But if it is, stations will have to comply with Ofcom's programme and advertising codes, and submit an annual report of their business.

  "<p>The Libyan leader Muammar Gadafy today added his voice to growing calls from the Arab world for the immediate release of the two French journalists being held hostage in Iraq, following an unprecedented diplomatic campaign.</p> <p>Col Gadafy said kidnapping foreigners in Iraq amounted to \"terrorism\" and that kidnappings were especially reprehensible when they involved \"hostages from countries that stood against the war in Iraq\".</p> <p>Although he did not name the two hostages, Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale and Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro, Col Gadafy made it clear he was asking for their release.</p> <p>\"I call on abductors of those hostages to free them immediately because this harms Islam,\" he said.</p> <p>The Libyan leader's comments followed days of frantic diplomatic activity by the French government, which has refused to bow to the kidnappers' demands to scrap a ban on Muslim headscarves in schools. </p> <p>The French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, has spent the past few days meeting leaders from across the Middle East and yesterday secured the assistance of Jordan, which has had success in similar situations. At least nine Jordanian hostages have been freed in Iraq in the last two weeks.</p> <p>The kidnappings have stunned France, which vehemently opposed the US-led war in Iraq, and were widely condemned throughout the Arab world where many see France as an ally.</p> <p>Yasser Arafat has called for the \"immediate release\" of the men, saying France was a friend of the Palestinian cause, while Jordan's King Abdullah II was quoted as telling Mr Barnier the abduction of the journalists \"reflects the transgression committed by some against the ethics and values of benevolence and justice, which constitute the pillars of Islam\". </p> <p>Today Pope John Paul added his voice to calls for the journalists' release during his weekly audience in Rome.</p> <p>According to unconfirmed reports, France has also dispatched Philippe Rondot, the secret agent who in the 1980s secured the release of hostages held in Lebanon, and a team of secret agents to Iraq to seek contacts with the captors.</p> <p>The official Jordanian news agency, Petra, reported from Iraq last night that it expected the release of the journalists \"within the next few hours\", saying its report was based on \"well-informed\" sources.</p> <p>However, there have been conflicting reports from the area over the past 24 hours with the Arab news network al-Arabiya reporting yesterday afternoon that their release was \"imminent\".</p> <p>Al-Jazeera reported at the weekend that the original Sunday night deadline for their release had been extended by 24 hours.</p> <p>But today there were claims that the deadline had actually been put forward by 48 hours, taking it to this evening.</p> <p>A little-known militant group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed responsibility for the hostage taking.</p> <p>It did not say what would happen to the two men if France refused to back down, but it is thought to be the same group that claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and killing of the Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni.</p> <p>In a videotape shown on Monday on al-Jazeera, Chesnot and Malbrunot called on Mr Chirac to obey the kidnappers' demand and rescind the ban on Muslim head scarves in schools to save their lives.</p> <p>The controversial law is part of a broader measure aimed at combating racism that also bars skullcaps and crucifixes that will come into force when the school year restarts on Thursday. </p> <p>Chesnot, 37, of Radio France Internationale, said: \"It is a wrong and unjust law and we may die at any time.\" </p> <p>Malbrunot, 41, who writes for Le Figaro and the regional daily newspaper Ouest France, said: \"Our life is in danger and we might die at any moment if the law doesn't get banned.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger delved deeply into his Hollywood past during his speech last night at the Republican national convention. While the man who is now governor of California has put his Hollywood career on the back-burner, his back catalogue still played a prominent role in his address to the party faithful. </p> <p>Although focused on saluting the achievements of President Bush, Mr Schwarzenegger's speech came peppered with references to his own former career. After arriving on stage to prolonged applause, he told the delegates that the reception was \"like winning an Oscar\" (something he has never actually done). Later he reminded the convention that \"one of my movies was called True Lies, and that's what the Democratic convention should have been called\".</p> <p>The choice of Mr Schwarzenegger as an early speaker at the RNC was widely interpreted as an attempt by the party to appeal to swing voters. The actor's views on such issues as abortion, gun control and gay marriage are markedly less right-wing than those of the bulk of Republican activists or, indeed, of the current President. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Mr Schwarzenegger repeatedly praised Mr Bush for his \"perseverance, character and leadership\" in a speech which also made much of Mr Schwarzenegger's \"rags to riches\" story after arriving in America as an Austrian immigrant.</p> <p>\"Ladies and Gentlemen, America is back,\" he told a rapt convention in homage to his signature role as the Terminator.</p>",
  "<p>The fate of two French journalists kidnapped in Iraq hangs in the balance as the deadline set by their kidnappers appeared to have been extended until this evening, according to reports.</p> <p>But confusion remains as to whether the deadline set by Islamist militants expires tonight - 24 hours later than previously thought - or whether it has already run out.</p> <p>The Arab League secretary general, Amr Moussa, and other officials said they believed the deadline was extended by 48 hours from Monday to Wednesday evening, not by 24 hours to Tuesday evening, as previously thought.</p> <p>There has been no new word from the kidnappers of Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot despite a huge diplomatic effort from France to free them. </p> <p>\"I think we can say the ultimatum has been delayed. That gives us some hope. It allows us to explore other channels,\" Lhaj Thami Breze, the president of the Union of French Islamic Organisations, told Europe 1 radio station. The Arab League's ambassador in Paris, Nassif Hitti, also said his organisation believed the deadline had not expired. </p> <p>\"That gives us more hope that there can perhaps be a positive outcome to this tragedy,\" he told LCI television.</p> <p>An influential Sunni organisation in Iraq, the Committee of Ulema, said it had failed to get in touch with the kidnappers and feared the journalists would be killed.</p> <p>\"There are so many conflicting signals,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Herve Ladsous, who is travelling with the French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, on a diplomatic mission in the Middle East aimed at securing the journalists' release.</p> <p>The gravity of Malbrunot and Chesnot's plight was highlighted yesterday when 12 Nepali hostages were executed by a different group of Iraqi militants. </p> <p>French officials are remaining cautious about the journalists' fate.</p> <p>\"Today we have no information that allows us either to be inclined towards optimism or to fear the worst,\" the education minister, Francois Fillon, told RMC radio. A militant group calling itself the Islamic Army took Malbrunot and Chesnot hostage, demanding that France revoke a new law banning religious symbols in state schools, including the wearing of Muslim headscarves. The new school year starts on Thursday. But the French president, Jacques Chirac, has repeatedly rejected their demands. </p> <p>Chesnot is a reporter for Radio France Internationale and Malbrunot writes for the dailies Le Figaro and Ouest France. </p> <p>The Italian journalist, Enzo Baldoni, was killed last week after Italy refused demands to withdraw its troops from Iraq. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS</b>: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1294774,00.html\">Up to 400 hostages, including 200 schoolchildren, were today taken hostage in a school in southern Russia. The attackers have reportedly threatened to blow up the buildings should the security forces attempt to intervene</a>.</p> <p>George Bush's Republican party formally nominated him last night as its candidate in November's presidential election. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1294771,00.html\">Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered a powerful sermon on the liberating virtues of Republicanism, writes Matthew Wells</a>.</p> <p><b>16 KILLED IN ISRAEL BUS BOMBINGS</b></p> <p>Yesterday's two bus bombings in Israel were the first for six months - the tactic was familiar, and the scene horrifically so. \"Three medics carefully took the body of a young woman through the empty window of a bus, her head tilted backward, long black hair covering her scorched face and neck,\" reports the Herald Tribune. \"The two suicide bombers were also dead, the head of one lying on the bloody floor of bus No.6, next to a mound of human limbs, onions, grapes and shreds of clothing.\"</p> <p>Sixteen people died and more than 100 were injured when the bombs detonated, around 100 metres apart, in Beersheba. More might have been killed had the driver of the number 12 bus not heard the explosion on the number six, opened the doors and urged people to disembark. Within seconds, his own bus blew up. </p> <p>Hamas claimed responsibility, describing the bombings as a revenge attack for the assassination of its leaders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel-Aziz al-Rantassi. </p> <p>Israel has attributed the previous lull in violence to the construction of the West Bank security fence, which does not yet reach Beersheba. \"For Israeli officials, the killings were proof of the vital necessity to accelerate the building programme,\" says Patrick Bishop in the Times. He quotes Tzahi Hanegbi, the public security minister, as saying: \"What we have learned in the last six months ... is that in places where the fence exists there is no terror, and in places where there is no fence there is terror.\"</p> <p>The Guardian says \"construction of the barrier has been accompanied by other measures - mass arrests, restrictions on movements and assassination of militants - which may have been equally significant\", adding that \"during the last two years, virtually all the original leaders of Hamas in Gaza have been killed\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1294663,00.html\">Suicide bombers return to Israel</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/01/wmid101.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/01/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Deaths prove need for barrier</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/536711.html\">IHT: Twin bus bombs kill 16 in Israel</a></p> <p><b>BUSH CHANGES TUNE ON TERROR</b></p> <p>The Herald Tribune is acerbic: \"Bush now vows to 'win' war on terror\". Note the \"now\". \"This was a turnabout from his assertion, in an interview broadcast Monday ... that the struggle against terrorism might never end.\"</p> <p>The change seems to reflect a Republican tactic identified by Gerard Baker in today's Times. The Bush administration, he says, wants to re-establish a link between 9/11 and Iraq in voters' minds - a link eroded by the failure to discover WMD and a lack of evidence that Saddam Hussein had cooperated with al-Qaida.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Times splashes with a photograph of the bloodied bodies of the 12 Nepalese hostages killed in Iraq. The photograph was posted on the website of the Army of al-Sunnar, an organisation linked to al-Qaida, yesterday.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1294771,00.html\">Republicans seek four more years of Bush</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/536706.html\">IHT: Bush vows to 'win' war on terror</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,172-1241137,00.html\">Times: Gerard Baker</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-1240841,00.html\">Times: Hostage fears after mass killings</a></p> <p><b>LORD BLACK 'PLUNDERED' HOLLINGER</b></p> <p>Nothing excites the papers like the downfall of a rival newspaper proprietor and his elegant wife. \"Disgraced newspaper tycoon Conrad Black\" - the former owner of the Telegraph - \"systematically looted GBP220m from his company [Hollinger International] to finance his lavish lifestyle, a devastating report revealed yesterday,\" says the Mail, smacking its lips.</p> <p>Lord Black's wife, the erstwhile Telegraph columnist Barbara Amiel, is pictured at a fancy dress party in the guise of Marie Antoinette. \"EMPRESS OF EXCESS,\" says the paper. \"A GBP24,000 birthday dinner, GBP300,000 holiday flights, GBP50,000 to refit the Roller and handbags at GBP1,400 a time ...\"</p> <p>Surely they can't mean the kind of handbag that Times fashion writers are recommending to their readers today: the GBP1,026 Chloe snakeskin bag or the perfectly vile Prada \"croc bag with jewelled clasp\" for GBP3,270?</p> <p>The Independent is moved to splash with the story, and the Telegraph bravely devotes a double-page spread to it. According to the report, Lord Black was not the only executive to have milked the parent company for cash - its chief operating officer, F David Radler, is also alleged to have taken a slice. Between them, they took cash amounting to 92.5% of Hollinger's \"entire adjusted net income during 1997-2003\", says the paper. </p> <p>Lord Black denies the charges, and described the authors of the report - a special committee of the Securities and Exchange Commission - as a \"menace to capitalism\" in July.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Media/site/story/0,14173,1294741,00.html\">Lord Black 'plundered Hollinger'</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=H5LNLDRIHVMFJQFIQMFCNAGAVCBQYJVC?xml=/news/2004/09/01/wholl01.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/09/01/ixportaltop.html&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=61095\">Telegraph: Black 'lined pockets'</a></p> <p><b>DIVORCE RATE SOARS</b></p> <p>New figures revealing that the divorce rate has reached a seven-year high has all the papers - like many a bickering couple - looking for someone to blame. </p> <p>The Telegraph's lead knows just where to point the finger. \"Women who marry in their twenties are adding to the soaring divorce rate by splitting up from their husbands before they reach 30,\" the paper splashes, adding that \"women are more financially secure and confident\". </p> <p>Divorce is highest among women aged 25 to 29. \"Their marriages are breaking up at a rate of almost 29 per 1,000, more than double the national average.\" Somewhat later in the story, the paper adds that, of the divorces granted to women, \"in more than half the cases the reason given was the husband's behaviour\".</p> <p>It's the government's fault, according to the Mail. \"Labour under fire over biggest increase in break-ups since 1985,\" it says. The Express, however, believes Tony Blair must share the blame with new technology because \"the internet and new laws are making it too easy to split\".</p> <p>The Guardian and the Independent, in a show of unity, highlight the role of reunion websites, with the Guardian warning that they are \"unwittingly fuelling a surge in marital break-up as bored husbands and wives contact old flames\".

  "<p>An Indian actor who found fame in Britain after landing a part in EastEnders has spoken for the first time about the immigration wrangle that could lead to his deportation, blaming poor legal advice and opposition from British Asian actors for his predicament. </p> <p>Dalip Tahil is frustrated that the actors' union Equity has opposed his applications for a work permit in Britain, and says he wants to restore his credibility after being branded an illegal worker by the press. </p> <p>Tahil, who is well known in India because of his prolific work in \"Bollywood\" cinema, came to Britain in 2002 to perform in the hit musical Bombay Dreams. He was picked by EastEnders' producers to play Dan Ferreira, the head of a new Indian family introduced to the soap last year. </p> <p>But Equity complained that his work permit was not in order, and when the BBC applied to have it regularised, the union said the corporation had not done enough to make sure that there were no Asian actors already in Britain who could do the job. The BBC was forced to drop him from the soap, causing chaos as storylines were hastily rewritten. </p> <p>Much of the subsequent press coverage was negative. The story was broken by the People last November, under the headline \"Swoop on illegal EastEnd star - Dan banned from TV, he faces boot from Britain\". </p> <p>Tahil says he is the victim of the envy of some Asian actors who feel they should have got the part. \"The Asian community has by and large supported me, and the majority of British Asian actors have been totally supportive,\" he said. \"But I feel I wasn't given the support I would have expected from a union, a fraternity that I feel is my own. That was very disappointing.\" </p> <p>Equity says it is obliged to protect the interests of its members, and there were a \"multitude\" of British Asian actors who could have played the part. A spokesman said: \"This is not about Dalip Tahil's talents as an actor. Part of our job is to maximise the opportunities for our members.\" </p> <p>Tahil faces deportation unless he can prove that his immigration status is the result of poor advice by his former solicitor, who is now the subject of a complaint to the Law Society. The actor has now engaged a new firm of lawyers and is hoping that the result of a forthcoming court hearing will allow him to resume his career in Britain. </p> <p>\"I would like to tell my supporters and wellwishers that I have been caught in circumstances not of my making,\" he told the Guardian. \"I haven't come here to try to cheat the state. I'm here to contribute in any way I can. I have rented my own flat and I have never claimed benefits.\" </p> <p>Tahil came to prominence after EastEnders decided it wanted to introduce an Indian family to Albert Square, feeling that the soap did not accurately reflect multicultural London. But the storyline was thrown into confusion when he was forced to leave, and his absence has been explained by increasingly far-fetched theories. </p> <p>Tahil is no longer under contract to the BBC. A spokeswoman for EastEnders said it was open for him to return, but there were \"no plans at present\" to write him back in. </p> <p>Before coming to Britain, Tahil was a prominent actor in India. He was educated at Sherwood College, an Indian public school, under an English principal, the Rev Robert Llewelyn, and says he regards Britain as a \"home from home\". </p> <p>Asked why he does not simply return to India and resume his acting career there, the actor said: \"I want to clear my reputation.\"</p>",
  "<p>The al-Jazeera bureau in Baghdad is shut down for a month or maybe more, because, according to the Iraqi interior minister Falah al-Naqib, the network is encouraging \"criminals and gangsters\". Al-Jazeera claims that it is simply doing its job. So, does the Arab media's enfant terrible have anything helpful to offer, or is it inflammatory as charged? </p> <p>For the last 10 months I have been studying al-Jazeera, visiting its bureaux around the world and interviewing its staff. On one level, it is obvious why the Americans and their Iraqi allies were keen to shut down the network's Baghdad bureau, especially in the run-up to a major assault on the holy city of Najaf. Al-Jazeera nearly bust up a much stronger American-led coalition before, in the winter of 2001, during the bombing of Afghanistan. </p> <p>Then the network's monopoly on pictures from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan stretched the resolve of some of America's allies to breaking point. Pakistan's President Musharraf had to appeal to the US to stop the bombing before he lost control of his country. Violence against Christians broke out in Pakistan and police had to be stationed at churches, schools and hospitals. </p> <p>A month ago, al-Jazeera's coverage of the kidnap of a Filipino truck driver rattled Philippine morale so much, President Gloria Arroyo was forced to pull her country's troops out of Iraq. If al-Jazeera had been there to report accidental damage to the Imam Ali mosque, all hell might have broken loose. </p> <p>But what the US and the Iraqi authorities fail to take into account is that such reporting is only part of al-Jazeera's output. After 9/11, al-Jazeera started a weekly talkshow out of Washington, From Washington, during which the host interviewed many members of the US administration, as well as a variety of other politicians, Republican and Democrat. </p> <p>In January, at the start of the US primary elections, al-Jazeera started another weekly show called US Presidential Race which, like From Washington, is broadcast from the Washington bureau. US Presidential Race is concerned with the forthcoming US elections: it covered most of the primaries in the major states and will continue to cover events up until the November elections and beyond, until the president's inauguration. </p> <p>US Presidential Race has taken great pains to explain to Arab viewers the US political and electoral process. Al-Jazeera reporters travelled around America to meet Arab communities in different states; they asked people what they thought of the elections, what were the key issues, who they were going to vote for and why. By the time the election arrives, Arab viewers will have had an opportunity to follow the democratic process every step of the way. </p> <p>More of the Democratic convention was aired on al-Jazeera than on most US networks - several hours each night, more than the combined time of the three US news networks covering the convention. Al-Jazeera's London bureau has a similar focus on British politics. Three weekly programmes come live out of London, besides which al-Jazeera gives extensive coverage to British news, politics, opposition activities and goings-on in parliament. </p> <p>When the Iraqi Governing Council first banned al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya from covering any official activities in Iraq at the end of September 2003, the ban undermined the council's calls for democracy, and its stated independence from the US administration. Now the ban by the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, has similarly undermined his credibility. </p> <p>Once again the Arab press has observed how life under this government, just like life under the coalition, is similar in spirit, if not in practice, to life under Saddam - journalists in the field are continually harassed, shot at and arrested and their equipment confiscated. Armed police forcibly closed down the al-Jazeera news bureaux while accusations that the channel had inside knowledge about attacks on the coalition are not substantiated with proof. Although this ban has not stopped the channel covering events inside Iraq, it has served to send a clear message to Iraqis - that freedom of expression in Iraq does not mean the same thing as it does in the west, just as civil rights for Arabs do not mean the same thing as they do in the west. </p> <p>The ban has also done much to rehabilitate the station in the eyes of ordinary Arabs, who see the accusations against al-Jazeera as a mark of its independence. Hafez al-Mirazi, al-Jazeera's show host and bureau chief told me why when I spoke with him in Washington. </p> <p>\"The interviews we were given by the Americans, especially after the Afghan war, created some scepticism in the Arab world and drove people back to saying: 'There is something going on between those guys at al-Jazeera and the Americans. They are doing the jobs of Mossad and the CIA and the Israelis and the Americans.' Even the al-Qaida tapes, people were saying, were doctored and given to al-Jazeera in order to prove that 9/11 had been done by Arabs. The administration thinks that it is punishing us by not giving us interviews - in fact, they are not punishing us, but helping our image in the Arab world.\" </p> <p>What the new government in Iraq should be doing is trying to engage with al-Jazeera, while tolerating the criticism that will inevitably come. That would send the message that they were serious about freedom of expression. </p> <p>The Americans would do well to do the same. Unfortunately, despite a dramatic increase in the amount the US spends on public diplomacy programmes, to about $1.2bn a year, long-term investment in learning Russian during the cold war means today there is a serious dearth of Arabic speakers in the US administration. America has only two or three spokespeople capable of appearing in a debate on al-Jazeera to advocate US policy, in Arabic. And if America cannot even answer the case against it, then what can it expect but be trampled on in every argument? As Woody Allen once said, \"90% of life is just showing up.\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hugh Miles is writing a book about al-Jazeera which will be published in January </p> <p><a href=\"\" \"mailto: party@hughmiles.com\">party@hughmiles.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Lord Black, according to the long-awaited internal report into the financial scandal at Hollinger International, was the architect of his own downfall.</p> <p>\"Black called the shots, and he wanted a board filled with prominent people who wouldn't make waves,\" it read. \"Black got what he wanted, until he pushed so far beyond the limits of acceptable behaviour that he triggered the formation of the special committee and its investigative process.\"</p> <p>The committee, led by former SEC chief Richard Breeden, paints a now familiar picture of Hollinger as a firm ruled by a tyrant who took what he wanted with scant regard for the business or other shareholders.</p> <p>Lord Black and a handful of others are accused of looting the former Telegraph owner of more than $400m (\u00a3221m) through excessive compensation, unapproved bonuses, non-compete fees, loans and personal expenses.</p> <p>Further allegations of his extravagance emerge in the 500-page document, as do further instances of extreme audacity.</p> <p>When Lord Black was putting together the $2.1bn sale of Canadian publications to CanWest, he is said to have arranged a side deal for an annual $3.9m in ongoing \"management fees\" to be paid to his private firm Ravelston, in return for lowering the sale price by $39m.</p> <p>In typically pompous fashion, he is cited elsewhere in the report writing to vice-chairman David Radler of the \"splendid conveyance of the non-competition agreements from which you and I profited so well ...\"</p> <p>But shareholders are looking beyond titillating headlines. The report opens new avenues of questioning, related to the members of the audit committee, to Richard Perle, the only \"independent\" member of the executive committee, and to outside audit firm KPMG.</p> <p>The special committee suggests the audit committee is partly to blame, despite Lord Black and Mr Radler keeping information from them. The report describes the committee as \"careless\" and \"inert and ineffective\" and refers to its \"somnolence\".</p> <p>Their performance in reviewing non-compete payments to Lord Black and others \"was unacceptable\" and failed to question the $225m in management fees paid to Ravelston during the period in question.</p> <p>\"The board Black selected functioned more like a social club or public policy association than the board of a major corporation, enjoying extremely short meetings followed by a good lunch and discussion of world affairs.\" When one director questioned him, \"Black hissed, 'this is my company',\" the report said.</p> <p>In one 65-minute meeting Lord Black and Mr Radler won approval for $38m in management fees to themselves, paid via Ravelston, an incentive plan for the firm's digital division worth $5.3m to the \"senior executive group\" and the sale for $1 of two newspapers to a firm controlled by the two men.</p> <p>The report accused auditor KPMG of granting access to its papers very late in the inquiry. The auditors only allowed the investigators to review papers held by its Canadian arm, where Lord Black's holding companies are based. KPMG denied it obfuscated, noting the complexity of the inquiry.</p> <p>More damning was the suggestion that KPMG failed to properly advise the audit committee. The report found KPMG, along with law firm Torys, failed to tell the audit committee whether certain management fees and non-compete clauses had violated financial standards. These failures partly justified the audit committee's apparent laxity over fees paid to Lord Black and his associates. They also went some way in absolving directors Henry Kissinger and Shmuel Meitar, who were not on the audit committee.</p> <p>Only Richard Perle, a former US defence adviser closely associated with the Bush administration, was accused of enriching himself at the expense of the company. As the former chairman and chief executive of Hollinger Digital, Mr Perle received more than $3m in bonuses on top of his salary.</p> <p>He breached his fiduciary duties by signing unanimous consents without reading the documents; several apparently authorised the controversial transactions. The report said he should return all money he earned while at the company.</p> <p>Shareholder Tweedy Browne, which controls 18% of Hollinger and is also threatening legal action, said the report was a \"step in the right direction\". The fund manager's Laura Jereski said: \"We still have a long way to go before the special committee completes its obligations to shareholders ... to secure large chunks of cash for the benefit of all shareholders. The responsibility for allowing the money to leave rests with the board.\"</p> <p>Investigations are still going on at the SEC and the department of justice. There were suggestions the SEC had sent notices to former members of the company to the effect that it is preparing to file charges. The SEC made no comment.</p> <p>Hollinger has filed a $1.25bn lawsuit naming Lord Black, Mr Radler and others; the sum is three times the $400m the firm claims was taken. That suit has been held up until publication of the report. Hollinger lawyers will now gain access to documents held by Ravelston, and the chance to depose Lord Black, Mr Radler and others who refused to give interviews during the internal inquiry.</p> <p>Ravelston, representing Lord Black and Mr Radler, again asserted their innocence. \"Mr Breeden and the special committee have squandered more than $25m of shareholders' money in a futile 14-month investigation that paralysed Hollinger International, eroded the value of its assets and persecuted and defamed those who created the value they are now vandalising,\" it said.</p> <p>Hollinger has told the court it hopes to finish discovery by December; Lord Black's lawyers argue they need until next July.

  "<p>\"Over there, across the Pacific, is the USA! To the north, Siberia! West is China; south, Japan and Korea and eventually Australia!\" There's no mistaking Tony Barrell's excitement as he visits Russia's easternmost territories. And it's infectious: this is real frontier country, a place the size of Australia, rich in oil and gas and timber but with just seven million inhabitants. Culturally, it's a melting pot and proud of it. \"I've got 16 different kinds of blood in my veins,\" one local declares. \"We are not European and we are not Asians,\" says another. </p> <p>Barrell's four-part tour of <strong> The Real Far East</strong> (9.05am and repeated, World Service) kicks off in Vladivostok, a great international port until the Soviet era and now reopened to the world. The \"Lord of the East\" is Russia's main gateway to the Pacific, but the central government is neglecting it. The infrastructure is crumbling and the only real investment comes from Chinese \"businessmen\" hiding behind Russian frontmen.

  "<p>The athletes have landed. At Gatwick. And all over the world. Men and women walking through their front doors again. Some covered in gold, others drenched in disappointment. Some met with hugs, others with, \"What happened? You let yourself down, your family down, but most importantly, the entire nation down. Oh, well. I'll put the kettle on.\" </p> <p>But one thing unites them all. Talent. Somewhere along the line, they proved they were brilliant enough to represent their country. After all, you can't just turn up to Athens with a rucksack and a pot of hummus and say, \"Right. Think I fancy the hurdles today. Where do you want me? Great. See you tomorrow for a spot of javelin\" </p> <p>In contrast, I've just returned from the Edinburgh festival. And it's full of people who have simply pitched up and put a show on. \"Right, think I fancy stand-up comedy today. Get me a mic. Great. See you tomorrow for Belgian dance/poetry.\" It doesn't even have to be good. Who's checking? I mean, you'll think it's good. Your mates say you're funny. But one man's comedy is another man's tragedy. And the trouble with the creative industries is that there's no quality control. Other fields have tricks to make entry harder. They're called exams. Wanna be a doctor? No trouble, Read this book. It's six years long. Barrister? Go to wig school. Comedian? Er ... just start I suppose. </p> <p>I saw a lot of bad shows. It's heartbreaking. I know the difference between raw talent and no talent. But the latter often comes with self-delusion. A reality gap. How good we think we are versus what other people see. And it's that gap that I'm trying to reduce. My suggestion is as controversial as this: we should all try and find what we're good at. Which is often different to what we want to be good at. But chasing false dreams is ultimately the most crushing thing of all. You lose confidence, gain poverty. </p> <p>I know all this. I'm a proper authority. Because I've done it. I went for gold but didn't realise they also made medals out of humble pie. But mine was even worse, stupider than anything I've described. I did take exams. I'm 32. I grew up in Thatcher's Britain. The City. Stockbroking everywhere on TV. I wanted a Porsche so fast it would melt. A shirt so stripey it would give me a headache. And a mobile phone the size of Kent (because I thought the bigger they were, the more expensive). All around me were stories of easy money. A mate's dad's plumber, who had a job fixing the toilets at Goldman Sachs one day and ended up becoming a millionaire just through eye-contact with the receptionist. Yes, please. </p> <p>So I read Business at university. I did well. Excelled in marketing, psychology, strategy. Bombed in statistics, accountancy, financial markets. Not a problem. I'll just not take those options any more. All those numbers confuse me! And although you can already see what's coming, I couldn't. I wrote off to London. Basically, when do I start? Well, it didn't take long because one of the things they looked for was enthusiasm and passion. And boy, did I have those. I was able to look them in the eye, and say quite honestly, that this was all I ever wanted to do. Job offer accepted. </p> <p>I loved the dealing room. I'd dreamed of it and it was even better than that. Screens. Shouting (increasingly at me). Quality banter with the boys. I was a bloke in a wheelchair, a novelty to them ... (my nickname was raspberry ripple - work it out). Many of them took me under their wing. I felt liked. And initially when I wasn't expected to do anything other than watch, I was good at my job. But after a few months, something terrible happened. They asked me to do stuff. Show some understanding. The job for which I was being paid. How dare they? And I tried to remember what I'd learned. Think Ash. Get a grip. Umm, er ... is it good when prices rise ... er, or is that sort of bad? Can't remember. </p> <p>All I can say is, it's a proper horrible moment when your dreams come whacking down. There I was. In the place I'd always wanted to be, but with no right to be there. A constant headache - stress, not my shirt. Quite simply, crap at the job. And though the writing had been on the wall from long ago, it was not a wall I wanted to read. Because the reality of the situation, ie my shocking aptitude for maths (I once bought 10 million deutschmarks when I was supposed to sell them), was standing in the way of my dream. And I kidded myself and everyone around me for as long as I could. Until I was in the dealing/dreaming room, where suddenly there was nowhere to hide. But I wasn't fired. I didn't give them the chance. </p> <p>I won't bore you with the lows that followed. Suffice to say, I felt a world-class tool. Lying is something you're supposed to do to other people. That's good lying. But to yourself? Unforgivable. Bad lying. But out of the gloom came a promise to myself. That I would chase a dream, but a realistic one based on an honest assessment of my abilities. I settled on television, and after a year out of work, fluked a job from which they haven't yet managed to fire me. I'm OK at it. </p> <p>In a competitive world where even plenty of talented people fall by the wayside, non-talented people don't stand a chance. So find your thing. Even if it's totally random. On my way around Edinburgh, the street performers were sometimes better than the shows. You've probably seen the same ones at Covent Garden. Many opt to paint themselves silver or gold, and then either stand totally still for hours. Or perhaps move in a robotic fashion. It's easy to laugh at them. So I did. But actually, they were very good at it. They'd found their thing, bizarre though it was. So while I worry for their CVs (\"2001-04. Painted myself gold and stood really still\") I admire their skill. There was even someone who for \u00a35 was offering to engrave your name on a grain of rice. Perhaps that's taking things too far, unless of course you want a risotto named after you. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ash Atalla produced The Office</p>",
  "A court trying alleged coup plotters in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea suspended proceedings yesterday, saying it wanted more information on the alleged roles of Sir Mark Thatcher, son of the British former prime minister, and other international financiers. <p>A three-judge tribunal agreed to the attorney general's request for an indefinite suspension, saying a \"just sentence\" was not possible until international investigations were finished. </p> <p>Sir Mark is under house arrest until 2m rand (\u00a3165,000) bail is posted. </p> <p>Defence attorneys protested at the suspension, saying that under Equatorial Guinea law it could mean up to five years' pretrial detention for 19 accused mercenaries who have already been subjected to six months imprisonment and alleged torture in the west African state. </p> <p>The authorities say they foiled an alleged plot to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang in March, as dozens of suspected mercenaries allegedly prepared at airports in Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea to launch the coup. </p> <p>Prosecutors accuse Sir Mark and his alleged co-conspirators of scheming to replace Mr Obiang's 25-year-old regime with a puppet government. </p> <p>A total of 88 men are now detained in Equatorial Guinea, Zimbabwe and South Africa in the case.

  "Manchester is Britain's unashamed capital of anti-social behaviour orders. <p>Councillors are proud that Asbos have helped to bring order back to some of the city's estates, and have little truck with those who worry about the rights of those targeted. </p> <p>Since 2000, Manchester has taken out 474 Asbos against 280 individuals whose activities have featured in the Manchester Evening News beneath headlines such as \"Yob is banned from airport\", \"Terror reign thug barred from street\" and \"Banned yobs may go to Europe\". </p> <p>Not all alleged yobs have been teenagers: more than 60% of the orders have been issued against adults, many of them young men in their 20s. </p> <p>The city is also proud that Bill Pitt, head of its nuisance strategy team, has been seconded to the Home Office to become an anti-social behaviour \"ambassador\" to encourage other towns to follow Manchester's lead. </p> <p>\"Bill Pitt's secondment to the Home Office is a powerful confirmation of the council's work in tackling anti-social behaviour,\" said Eddy Newman, the executive member for housing. </p> <p>\"Manchester's team are the most active in the UK in gaining around 4,000 successful legal actions against nuisance tenants to date. Only 17% of perpetrators breach their orders sufficiently to require criminal action in the courts.\" </p> <p>Asbos issued in Manchester have banned three boys from going anywhere near the city's airport without valid tickets. One youth was banned from wearing a glove - a gang emblem - and another was banned from using a laser pen after allegedly shining it in the eyes of bus drivers. </p> <p>The city also claims it issued the first Asbo to cover behaviour in a classroom and the first linked to domestic violence. Another Asbo banned an alleged car thief from every car park in the UK. </p> <p>A 13-year-old was banned from parts of the city for two years after neighbours claimed he trespassed in gardens, tormented residents, vandalised property and shouted abuse. </p> <p>In January, Greater Manchester police won Asbos against four alleged gang members. The men were banned from wearing body armour or riding bicycles anywhere in the city. </p> <p>Last year the former executive member for housing, Basil Curley, rejected claims that the orders infringed human rights. \"Somebody from Liberty rang up to complain and I offered to let him park his BMW in any of the streets where we are having problems,\" he said. \"He did not take up the offer.\"</p>",
  "Anybody who reads the poetry of Donald Justice, who has died aged 78, feels an urge to recite him to those in earshot; at each turn, new vistas open up. Justice won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 and the Bollingen Prize in 1991. If rather less prolific than WH Auden, he, too, relished tinkering and a delight in all verse forms (with a particular liking for the sestina) and what unifies his poetry is a distinct, if self-effacing, authorial voice. In discussing the relationship between memory and metre, he remarked that \"one motive for much, if not all, art is ... to keep memorable what deserves to be remembered\". <p>An accomplished painter, he had also studied music but lacked the confidence to pursue it as a career. Such wide-ranging references inform without encumbering his poetry - which also draws inspiration from popular thrillers. All of which made him a more inspired teacher and critic than many other poets who, like him, fetch up in academia. His poems were rarely longer than a page, and there was no great bulk in his total output. </p> <p>Justice was an only child, born in Miami and the son of an itinerant carpenter. Despite the grind of the Depression among the near-poor like his parents, he had piano lessons. Of his women teachers he recalled: \"It was clear to everyone, themselves included, that they were dedicated less to teaching than to the small sums their teaching brought in. This obvious fact embarrassed no one. Times were hard and these things were understood.\" </p> <p>However, one teacher, Mrs Snow, was a serious musician with a rhythm band. She made pupils write down the Baconian motto \"writing makes the exact man\", a harbinger of the precision for which Justice was renowned. </p> <p>After Allapattah elementary school - from which the bone disease osteomyelitis kept him away a year - and Andrew Jackson high school, he left Miami high to go to its City University in 1942. He had already read a great deal, and begun to write. There, too, he studied music with composer Carl Ruggles, but, when he graduated in 1945, it was with a degree in English. </p> <p>The childhood illness had kept him from war service, and he moved to New York, subsisting on odd jobs which gave him a taste of the quintessential Greenwich Village life. But in 1947, he opted for a master's course at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, there meeting another writer, Jean Ross, whom he soon married. </p> <p>After an unsatisfactory doctoral spell at Stanford University, California, they went to back to Florida, where he was, for a time, an instructor at the University of Miami. Crisscrossing America, the couple met encouraging writers - his wife's brother-in-law was Peter Taylor - including Randall Jarrell and Robert Frost. Then, from 1952 to 1954, he did a doctorate at the University of Iowa's programme in creative writing, the Iowa Writers' Workshop. This brought him into contact and conversations with John Berryman, Robert Lowell and the under-rated Karl Shapiro, as well as Nelson Algren, whose gambling habits were more outlandish than his own penchant for a flutter. </p> <p>A 1954 Rockefeller award brought Justice a year's sojourn in Europe, a stimulus to his writing - he was to be an adept translator. He was soon to return to the Workshop and remain there until 1967. </p> <p>In 1960, he published a first collection of poems, The Summer Anniversaries - a pamphlet, a chapbook, The Old Bachelor, had appeared in 1951. That 1960 collection contained On The Death Of Friends In Childhood, which was to figure in his former pupil John Irving's The Hotel New Hampshire - and in the movie made of it. </p> <p>In 1967, a second collection, Night Light was published - and Justice moved to Syracuse University, where he stayed until 1970. He then spent a year at the University of California, Irvine, and another year at Iowa. In 1973, his Departures was nominated for the National Book Award. In 1979 came his Pulitzer prize-winning Se lected Poems. From 1982 to 1992, he was at the University of Florida, Gainesville, after which he retired to Iowa City. In 1987 The Sunset Maker was published. </p> <p>Interspersed with all these works were pamphlets, selections, and revisions of individual volumes. Justice also tried to write plays and adaptations but, to his chagrin, found that something eluded him in doing so. </p> <p>His mid-career taste was for chance assembly: one poem adapts prose by Henry James, another springs from a phrase in Wallace Stevens's notebook,\"the alp at the end of the street\", and another simply quotes a line from a spy novel - in so doing, it makes demotic dialogue almost transcendental: \"Maybe you know Bliss by another name.\" If, at times, a sense of loss pervades the work: </p> <p>I saw my grandmother grow weak.<br> When she died, I kissed her cheek.<br> I remember the new taste - <br> Powder mixed with a drying paste<br> </p> <p>there is, as with Philip Larkin, also a relish of life. </p> <p>Justice could well be a poet who outpaces those of his contemporaries whose packaging has begun to fall away. Many now quote, or anthologise, Ode To A Dressmaker's Dummy (1967), or the figure of Death whose arrival is the Incident In A Rose Garden (1967), while, more recently, there was Ralph: A Love Story (1999), a poignantly rollicking tale of a cinema projectionist who uses his cubby-hole to cuddle, and impregnate, the owner's daughter; shipped out by the navy, he heard later what had happened, but: </p> <p>So it was gone, the way a thing will go<br> Yet keep a sort of phantom presence always.<br> He might be drinking with some woman, lying<br> Beside her on a tourist cabin bed,<br> When something would come ghosting back to him,<br> some little thing. Such paradise it had been!<br> </p> <p>And, at the end, nightwatchman Ralph indeed - surrounded by cheap thrillers - finds it all come back, in a narrow bed at his sister's: </p> <p>in the form<br> Of images in the dark, shifting and flashing,<br> Badly projected, spooling out crazily<br> In darkness, in a little room, and he<br> Could not control it. It was like dying.<br> No, it was dying, and he let it go.<br> </p> <p>\"Donald Justice is dead\" is itself a sentence from his poem Variations On A Text By Vallejo (1973). This opens \"I will die in Miami in the sun\" and ends by picturing the scene as, one Sunday, the sun comes out, shining on the bay, on the white buildings while cars move slowly along, \"headlights on in spite of the sun\". And so it is that: </p> <p>after a while the diggers with their shovels<br> Walked back to the graveside through the sunlight,<br> And one of them put his blade into the earth<br> To lift a few clods of earth, the black marl of Miami,<br> And scattered the dirt, and spat,<br> Turning away abruptly, out of respect.<br> </p> <p>Justice would have greeted wryly that, come the event, it was in Iowa City, on a Friday, when he died, and that death made definitive the publication later last month of his Collected Poems. </p> <p>Justice is survived by his wife and his son. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Donald Justice, poet, critic and teacher, born August 12 1925; died August 6 2004</p>",
  "<p>When the season kicked off, just three weeks ago, Sunderland were many people's tip for automatic promotion. Now they look a busted flush. </p> <p>Nicky Forster's second-minute header proved to be the difference as Sunderland slumped to their third straight away defeat. </p> <p>There was plenty of huff and puff from Mick McCarthy's side, but not much quality as Reading clung on for victory. </p> <p>Reading went ahead after just two minutes. The goal was as straightforward as they come, Andy Hughes' right-wing cross brushing off Forster's head and past the out-of-position Mart Poom. </p> <p>It took 10 minutes or so for Sunderland to regroup, and another five for them to launch a meaningful attack. John Oster made space down the right and found Kevin Kyle, who launched himself at the ball - arms outstretched like Superman - only to balloon his header over the bar. </p> <p>Kyle then turned provider minutes later, flicking on Gary Breen's long thump forward into Dean Whitehead's path. The midfielder only had Marcus Hahnemann to beat but, after having elected to shoot early, saw his effort skim the outside of the post. </p> <p>The rest of the first-half was largely forgettable, with both sides cancelling each other out. The half-chances, however, fell to Reading. On the half-hour, James Harper's free-kick bounced off Poom's chest and squirmed inches out of the oncoming Forster's reach. </p> <p>Then, just before the interval, Forster had a better chance to increase the lead when sent clear by Dave Kitson. But he overran the ball and allowed Poom to gather. </p> <p>McCarthy brought on three substitutes shortly after half-time, but it was Reading who continued to look the more dangerous. As the game opened up, they increasingly tested Sunderland's back four, only to lose composure in the final third. Again it was Forster who was the main culprit, shooting straight at Poom after being put through by Kitson's fine backheel. </p> <p>Reading went even closer moments later. From a corner, Steve Sidwell's header hit the post but Kitson, following up, could not capitalise. </p> <p>Sunderland looked dangerous on the break, and Elliot should have done better when he rounded Hahnemann, only to fire into the side-netting.</p>",
  "<p>\"Laughable,\" said the Bath rugby coach John Connolly. \"Ridiculous\" was the view of the former England football assistant manager John Gorman. The idea that England's most successful rugby coach might take charge of one of the country's leading football clubs is not one that many leading coaches are taking seriously. </p> <p>\"I think it is someone with their ego out of control,\" said Connolly. \"Sometimes coaches get carried away with their own success and that has been proven in many cases. If you are going to manage or coach a side in a sport then you need an in-depth knowledge of the game. You have got to know what you are talking about.\" </p> <p>Jose Mourinho's and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's success supports the theory that the best managers are not necessarily the finest footballers. Both those coaches are highly respected, chiefly because of their managerial achievements and tactical acumen but also for their ability to extract the best from players. Woodward can certainly motivate, but can he transfer the qualities that have produced success on the rugby field to the football pitch? Connolly is not convinced. </p> <p>\"There are certain management and organisational skills in elite sport which are similar but not the same. What is required in rugby and football is physically and mentally different. The games are totally different; for example there is a certain calmness in soccer whereas rugby is played at a high arousal level.\" </p> <p>Tom McNab has practical experience of crossing sporting boundaries. The former Great Britain athletics coach has worked with Chelsea and the England rugby team as a fitness expert, but it is his time with the British bobsleigh team during the 1980s which carries the greatest resonance to Woodward's situation. </p> <p>\"The technical jump is too big to transfer sports,\" he said. \"When I moved across from athletics to bobsleigh I was applying myself to the things I knew already. The driving of the bobsleigh would be the equivalent of the football match, but I didn't look at bobsleigh in terms of the driving, just the push start, and I only looked at the fitness side of rugby. I was only operating in the areas which were reasonably clear.\" </p> <p>There is little doubt that Woodward has a passion for football, but professional footballers expect a more technical perspective. However, Frank Clark, deputy chief executive of the League Managers' Association, believes that it would be possible for Woodward to accumulate the knowledge required. </p> <p>\"We are always happy to accept talented people in the industry and he has obviously got some terrific qualities in terms of organisational and motivational skills,\" said Clark. \"But if he wants to be a head coach or a team manager then we would expect him to go through all the qualifications.\" </p> <p>Those regulations apply in the Premiership, where a head coach or manager must be in possession of a Uefa Pro licence. But the Football League does not set the same standards, opening the possibility of Woodward taking over at a club in the lower divisions. A more plausible scenario is that he might be given a broader remit which takes advantage of his ability to organise and delegate. </p> <p>Woodward applied those skills to the England rugby team, where teams of coaches were designated to look after forward and back play, kicking and throwing. Though such methods were seen as revolutionary in rugby, they would not be breaking new ground in football. \"It's all been done before,\" said Gorman. \"For example Ian Rush was working with the strikers at Liverpool last year, and most clubs have had a coach that works on the defensive play and another coach that works with the forwards for some time.\" </p> <p>Another quality synonymous with Woodward is his attention to detail. ProZone, which monitors the movement of players during matches, was heralded as a huge advance when first utilised by the England rugby team, but football already used it. All of which suggests that the man who revolutionised English rugby must bring something different to the table if he is to be embraced by football.</p>",
  "Lecturers at London Metropolitan University, one of the largest in the UK, will today demonstrate against contracts which unions claim compromise academic freedom and threaten the jobs of almost 400 staff directly involved. <p>Yesterday the university's vice chancellor, Brian Roper, accused the lecturers of living in \"la-la land\" in claiming that the jobs would be lost. </p> <p>The dispute marks a new low in relations at the university, created by the merger of two parent institutions two years ago, and the largest single academic body in London.</p> <p>Managers say lecturers from one merger partner, London Guildhall University, must today move on to contracts identical to those of staff of North London University, the other partner. If not, they will be deemed to have left their jobs, the university says. </p> <p>However, their union, Natfhe, refuses to accept the shift, claiming the contracts have been unilaterally imposed and limit professional autonomy. Lecturers will today burn copies of the contract outside university buildings. They say its terms require them to be in their offices from nine to five, affecting their research freedom, and to answer to \"line managers\" for teaching.</p> <p>The university says it has offered unions every opportunity to discuss the deal, and denies that jobs will be lost in the changeover provided staff accept the contracts. </p> <p>With Natfhe insisting that staff returning for the new term are not working on the contracts, and the university stating that employees will be deemed to have accepted the deal simply by turning up, the dispute has entered a legal thicket in which both sides claim to have employment law on their side. </p> <p>While union leaders say they will do their best to avoid any impact on students, there are threats of one-day strikes during induction week and beyond.</p> <p>Greg Barnett, Natfhe chairman at the university, said last night: \"We as a union don't accept that transfer [to a new contract].\" Its terms included \"nothing about professional autonomy and discretion\". Amanda Sackur, another Natfhe representative, accused the university of wanting to adopt a \"bullies' charter\" that others might emulate. </p> <p>Dr Roper rejected the claim that the university would dismiss the 387 academics affected. \"It is a kind of la-la land,\" he said last night. \"Tomorrow will dawn, and life will go on.\" It was \"rubbish\" that academic independence would be threatened; the deal had been accepted by Natfhe under a national agreement in 1999, and it did not affect pay or leave. </p> <p>The university also rejects suggestions that it has jeopardised the quality of its degrees this year in the face of a boycott by some external validators sympathetic to the lecturers. Natfhe says the process has been compromised because the examiners were told they would be judged to have approved scripts if the university did not hear from them by August 28.</p> <p>Dr Roper accused the union of \"guerrilla tactics\", and insisted that all degrees would be validated as normal after the university recruited extra external examiners, with the process complete by September 8.</p>",
  "The education watchdog Ofsted yesterday urged parents to be its \"eyes and ears\" in nurseries and childminders' homes as it published figures showing it received one complaint for every 20 registered care providers last year. <p>The statistics reveal Ofsted, which took over responsibility for regulating early years childcare from local authorities in 2002, investigated 6,250 complaints in the year to last March. Of those, it took legal action in 378 cases, including four prosecutions, shutting 49 nurseries and childminders and suspending 122 more. Three emergency orders were issued after concerns that a child was suffering from or at risk of serious harm. </p> <p>Complaints included a childminder seen dragging a three-year-old child along the street so forcefully he was pulled from the ground, and a nursery with a leaking roof and mould on the walls. </p> <p>The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, launching Ofsted's second annual report on early years inspections in England, said most childcare providers provided good or satisfactory care, with only 1% failing to meet minimum government standards between April 2003 and June this year. </p> <p>There are 84,000 childminders and 34,000 nurseries in England, providing places for 1.4 million pre-school children. </p> <p>However, Mr Bell acknowledged inspectors were not able to monitor nurseries and childminders \"24 hours a day\", and urged parents to \"act as Ofsted's eyes and ears\" and contact inspectors with particular concerns. </p> <p>The report, Protection through regulation, is published weeks after a BBC documentary used secret filming to expose bad practice in three private nurseries. Of those, two have now been ordered to make improvements within a set time or face being struck off. </p> <p>Ofsted insists it was already moving to address one of the key issues raised by the programme, the advance notice period given to providers before inspection which is to be shortened from weeks to days. </p> <p>Yesterday's report is designed to reassure parents that, while complaints over childcare remain relatively few, Ofsted acts swiftly and effectively to address concerns. </p> <p>The government, too, is anxious to be seen to be ensuring high standards in childcare, amid moves rapidly to expand the sector. Critics argue it is difficult to reconcile quantity with quality, when childcare is still a low-paid, low status occupation with patchy training. </p> <p>Ofsted rated 43.3% of childminders as good and 56% as satisfactory - meaning they met all 14 national childcare standards. Of the nurseries, 51.3% were rated good and 47.6% satisfactory. </p> <p>Only 0.7% of childminders and 1.1% of nurseries were deemed unsatisfactory. </p> <p>The proportion of complaints is around the same as in Ofsted's last report, which covered 19 months up to March 2003. Most concerns were raised by parents or other relatives of children cared for, followed by anonymous sources, social services, nursery staff and Ofsted staff or inspectors. </p> <p>Childcare bodies welcomed the report, and urged parents to use inspection information when choosing childcare. </p> <p>Daycare Trust's director, Stephen Burke, said: \"It is essential that Ofsted continues to develop and creates a transparent inspection process where standards are clearly understood by childcare providers and parents alike. </p> <p>\"We need to move towards a situation where parents are automatically given at least a summary of the Ofsted report when inquiring about a childcare place with a provider.\"</p> <p><b>Horror stories from the inspectors</b></p> <p>Complaints to Ofsted last year (real cases with identifying details changed)</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A childminder refused to ban her son, who was being investigated for alleged abuse of his own child, from her home while she was minding children. Ofsted was granted an emergency legal order adding a new condition to her registration, meaning that her son must never be present while she was looking after children. Ofsted carried out unannounced inspections to ensure she complied</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Another childminder lost her registration after admitting leaving her own child and a child in her care unsupervised, saying that it was acceptable to do so because a neighbour could listen to them on a baby monitor </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> During an unannounced inspection, a creche in a large leisure centre was found to be held in a dirty, unventilated room with broken lights, unsuitable furniture and toilets blocked and flooded with sewage. Toddlers were bored, lacked toys and \"wandered aimlessly, quarrelling\". Inspectors gave the nursery a week to improve or face prosecution. It improved, and inspectors made more unannounced visits to check standards</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A nursery refused to reduce the number of children on its roll, despite undergoing major building work which placed youngsters at risk of harm. Ofsted won a legal order compelling the nursery to cut the number of children in its care and to keep some rooms off limits in order to retain its official registration. Inspectors checked to ensure the new conditions were being followed</p>",
  "<p>The 91-year-old patient was given more than half a page in yesterday's Daily Telegraph to describe his one-month stay in an NHS hospital. He had private health insurance but with two fractures to his leg he \"instinctively sought the reassurance offered by the big William Harvey hospital in Kent with its wide range of skills and equipment\". This was no ordinary nonagenarian but Bill Deedes, Harold Macmillan's cabinet minister for spin, decorated war hero, golf partner to Denis Thatcher, former Daily Telegraph editor and still an outstanding regular contributor from various war zones.</p> <p>He suffered some familiar problems: visitors to other patients talking too loudly in a ward of ill people in pain; an uncomfortable trolley wait when his electrically powered, air-mattressed bed, disconnected from the power supply and kept waiting outside x-ray for too long, let its powerless mattress subside so that the frame bit into his back. Negligence? \"No, the pressure on the x-ray department was simply too heavy - in August, as everywhere else, staff are away...\" Far from being yet another long indictment of the shortcomings of the NHS, the Deedes report was a hymn of praise for the help he received from the NHS. Both nurses (\"a seam of gold\") and physiotherapists (artists who \"are the spring that restores so many patients back to normality\") are singled out for detailed praise. His aim was to correct the imbalance of other anecdotal stories that have left \"a dark portrait of our hospitals\". He concluded: \"If we are not to lose perspective, we ought to be more aware of, and more grateful than we are for, this golden thread of selfless service.\"</p> <p>Bill Deedes is not a lone voice. Successive annual surveys of up to 400,000 NHS patients have shown similar high approval rates (75% \"excellent\" or \"very good\" and 92% ready to recommend the hospital they used to a friend). Of course there are still problems: too little involvement of patients in treatment; too little information on the side-effects of medicines; a shortfall in pain control. But the NHS is not in as dire a state as Telegraph leader writers usually assume.</p>",
  "<p>As progress is made in reducing premature deaths from the major killers, such as cancers and heart disease, healthcare systems worldwide are turning their attention to improving the quality of care for people with long-term conditions such as arthritis and diabetes. </p> <p>The NHS Improvement Plan, published in June, includes a specific commitment to support people with long-term conditions to live healthy lives. This is welcome recognition of the need to reposition the NHS from the treatment of life-threatening illness to the continuing care of people whose conditions cannot be cured. </p> <p>Four things now need to happen to turn this commitment into reality. First, the Department of Health (DoH) must show the same determination in improving the quality of care for people with long-term conditions as they have in reducing waiting times for treatment. </p> <p>The political logic here is as inescapable as the medical logic. There are around 17 million people living with long-term conditions and these people have a strong interest in receiving the best possible care. A government that delivers tangible improvements in care will bolster its own support as well as doing the right thing for the population. </p> <p>The difficulty will be to ensure that inertia within the NHS and other demands do not crowd out the commitment to give higher priority to long-term conditions. Learning from the success in reducing waiting times, the government must ensure that this policy is properly resourced, and is communicated to the NHS as a key objective in the next phase. There also needs to be a high-powered team of clinicians and managers leading implementation and delivery. </p> <p>Second, within the NHS, primary care trusts (PCTs) must confound their critics who argue that they are the poor relations of the NHS family. As the organisations that control most of the NHS budget, PCTs are well placed to ensure that patients with long-term conditions have access to the care they need. </p> <p>PCTs must use the new contract for GPs to reward high-quality primary care, and to arrange for the provision of extra services in the community. These services include those of the \"community matrons\" who will take responsibility for people who are most at risk because they have more than one long-term condition. </p> <p>Third, the contribution of social care in enabling people with long-term conditions to live healthy lives must be recognised. This will not be easy in view of the modest increase in funding for social care announced in the July spending review, and the limited political salience of social care within government. </p> <p>The key priority here is to encourage closer integration of health and social care at a local level, making use of the flexibilities that are available to local authorities and PCTs. This includes further extending direct payments to empower users to access the services they need, and using the single assessment process to ensure that frontline staff are working in a coordinated way. </p> <p>Fourth, the NHS needs to work with the DoH to change policies that are inconsistent with the emphasis on long-term conditions. The greatest risks relate to the establishment of NHS foundation trusts centred on acute hospitals only, and the new system of \"payment by results\" under which hospitals will be paid for every patient they treat according to a national tariff. </p> <p>Healthcare systems that have made most progress in responding to the challenge of long-term conditions place a strong emphasis on service integration. NHS foundation trusts that bring together hospital and community services, either in the same organisation or through integrated working, offer the best chance of achieving similar improvements in the NHS. </p> <p>Even more important, the policy under which hospitals are paid for every patient they treat needs to be complemented by incentives that support high-quality primary care, and avoid unnecessary hospital admissions. The new contract for GPs should help in strengthening primary care, and action is urgently needed to modify payment by results to prevent people being treated in hospital when better alternatives are available. </p> <p>PCTs again have a role in offering incentives to GPs to help patients remain in the community. For its part, the DoH must ensure that the tariff does not encourage increases in emergency admissions of people with long-term conditions, and does not reward re-admissions to hospital within, say, 28 days of patients being discharged. These risks are recognised by the department, although it is not clear how they will be managed. </p> <p>A combination of healthcare organisations that integrate services and an incentive system that supports the direction set out in the improvement plan is needed to support the government's aspiration to reposition the NHS towards the care of people with long-term conditions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Chris Ham is professor of health policy and management at the Health Services Management Centre, University of Birmingham, and until June was director of the strategy unit in the DoH.

  "<p>Recently, quite out of the blue, Anthony Douglas had a phone call from a woman who introduced herself as the widow of his natural father. Douglas had never met her - indeed, he had met his father only once, fleetingly, 25 years ago - but she had belatedly discovered his existence and told him he had four half-brothers who were keen to make his acquaintance. </p> <p>\"So here I am, at 55, inheriting potentially another set of relationships in this kind of complex web,\" says Douglas, who was adopted at birth. \"At my age, you are a bit wary of it, but for them, of course, it's new and exciting. And it is for me in many ways: it's the last piece of information about it, but it's taken 55 years to complete all the pieces of the jigsaw.\" </p> <p>This complexity of Douglas's background enables him, he feels, to empathise with the fractured structures of so many modern families. It has set him in good stead during a successful career in social work and is likely to prove even more relevant in his new and highly challenging role, which he starts today, as chief executive of the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service, better known as Cafcass. </p> <p>As well as empathy, his experience of adoption - by no means an unqualified success, on his assessment - has no doubt contributed to a passion for helping families in crisis and, above all, children in need. \"It's highly emotive work,\" he says, admitting to being something of a driven character. \"I don't see how you can manage it neutrally. It's not like manufacturing kitchen units.\" </p> <p>Douglas is sure to need every drop of that passion in the weeks and months ahead. Cafcass, set up in 2001 to coordinate representation of children's interests before the courts, had what he calls a \"disastrous\" first two years. He thinks that its performance since then has been somewhat better, and that the organisation has not had sufficient credit for that, but that it still needs to undergo a process of cultural change in key parts of its operation. </p> <p>Following radical intervention by ministers, Cafcass has been moved under the umbrella of the Department for Education and Skills. The arms-length body has been given a more realistic budget of \u00a3107m - up almost 13% - and a new board chaired by Lady Pitkeathley, the Labour peer who is seen as having a wise head and a safe pair of hands. </p> <p>Douglas, who was headhunted for the job from Suffolk county council, where he had spent less than two years as director of social care and health, has never previously worked with Pitkeathley, but he recognises a kindred spirit. \"She wants to be associated with success, not failure, and wants to develop a stronger culture of delivery, urgency and corporate ownership of Cafcass,\" he says. \"We both believe in a supportive management culture for frontline staff, but equally we are both determined to get the work done without any nonsense.\" </p> <p>Whichever way you look at it, there was a good deal of nonsense in Cafcass's early years. Douglas, who was closely monitoring developments from a standpoint of chair of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, believes that the management process became widely discredited. This led to creation of parallel managements, most damagingly among the guardians ad litem appointed by courts to represent children. </p> <p>\"Many staff don't say 'we' as much as 'Cafcass', as if it's an external or independent organisation,\" he observes. \"What I want to get to very quickly is a 'Team Cafcass' approach, where all of our staff, whether employed or self-employed [as many guardians are], think of it as their organisation that they are proud to be part of and are positive about.\" </p> <p>As an avid cricketer, Douglas is keen also that his team should play to its strengths. That means a switch, in line with the recent green paper on parental separation, from what he terms \"commentating\" to more short-term intervention - \"sorting\" - in stressed families. That, in turn, implies a shift of emphasis from public law cases, typically involving children being taken into care, to private child custody issues. </p> <p>But how can that be achieved without leaving gaps on the public side? </p> <p>Douglas is convinced there is much duplication of effort by Cafcass staff and local authority social workers, assessing and working on behalf of the same child. Even before he took up his post, he was holding preliminary discussions with local government groups about sharing resources through formal compacts. </p> <p>\"There's a long-held principle of tandem representation, and the independence of the guardian is, of course, sacrosanct in law,\" he says. \"But a lot of time is sometimes spent duplicating a good local authority assessment rather than perhaps using a different validation process and spending time on those cases - which I guess would be more private law cases - where active intervention would really help change children's lives. </p> <p>\"It's like anything in life: if you have got an excellent piece of work, an excellent piece of plumbing, say, you don't get a second plumber to come along and rip it apart and do it again.\" </p> <p>As a notably thoughtful care professional - he is currently writing his fourth book - Douglas reflects on two epiphanies along the route of his career. The first came as a social services team manager in the 1980s, when he realised that his staff-centred view of the world was wrong and that his focus should be on outcomes for users of the services. The second came at Suffolk, where he learned the critical distinction between leadership and management and the importance of the former. Symbolically, he had no office of his own at county hall. </p> <p>At Cafcass, he intends generally to lead rather than manage, but has identified a couple of management tasks: implementing a 10-year pay and workforce strategy, which will include incentives to ensure that more experienced staff focus on more complex cases; and pushing through changes to create what he calls \"Cafcass local\" and \"Cafcass direct\", delivering services readily accessible to people who need short-term help and intervention. \"That implies a step change, from what is primarily a care management service to a faster, flexible front-end service,\" he says. </p> <p>Expect, too, that Cafcass will become a much more transparent organisation. Before he settled to social work, Douglas dabbled in journalism, and his policy has always been one of openness to the media. He is already in talks with an independent television producer about filming some early intervention work. </p> <p>He is in no doubt that the approach of \"certain newspapers\" contributes to the poor image of social work in Britain - an image that he says astonishes overseas staff he has recruited to Suffolk. But he insists: \"My job, and that of other leaders of the profession, is to treat that as a fact of life and to get as much publicity about the positive work that's done, nine times out of 10, as about the mistakes and catastrophes that do happen.\" </p> <p>Douglas thinks it will take two or three years to get Cafcass back on track to becoming a world-class service. Despite marked improvement in its performance, there continue to be cases of children waiting to be allocated guardians - particularly in regional \"hot spots\" - and the organisation is on average allocating 56% of public law cases within two days of request, against a target of 70% by March next year. On the private law side, 4.4% of reports are unallocated less than 10 weeks before the due date for filing with the court, against a current target of 4.0%. </p> <p>By the very nature of its work, Douglas reckons it will always be an uphill task for Cafcass to achieve a glowing reputation. When people come into contact with it, they tend to be in conflict and are angry and distressed - as exemplifed recently by high-profile protests by campaigners for fathers' rights. </p> <p>Douglas will aim to reach out even to \"hostile\" groups, though Cafcass has a standing policy of no contact with the most militant, Fathers 4 Justice. But he believes firmly in listening to the child when it comes to decisions about custody and access. \"Children as young as three, four or five who experience parental separation will usually know who they want to be with,\" he says. \"If you follow their instincts, that's normally the best way to do it.\" </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Age</strong> 55 </p> <p><strong> Status</strong> Married, two daughters </p> <p><strong> Lives</strong> Islington, north London </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> St Nicholas grammar school, Hillingdon, west London; St Peter's College, Oxford, and Open University (psychology). </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> 1975-76: unqualified social worker, Rhondda, south Wales; 1976-83: social worker, Hackney, east London; 1983-86: team leader, Southwark, south London; 1986-88, deputy area manager, Barnet, north London; 1988-91: area manager, Newham, east London; 1991-96: assistant director (children and families), Hackney; 1996-2002: director of social services, and subsequently executive director of community services, Havering, east London; 2002-04: director of social care and health, Suffolk; 2004-present: chief executive, Cafcass. </p> <p><strong> Interests</strong> Cricket (played for Middlesex 2nd XI), playing the saxophone.</p>",
  "Sunday, 9am. With a dull thud, a wodge of newspapers drops on the mat and once a week, in some household, hearts drop with them. A paedophile outed, a minister exposed, a council's competence trashed ... shock, horror, scandal and huge headlines. <p>Of course, the News of the World and its like are not some force of nature. They answer to the courts and, very occasionally, the non-statutory Press Complaints Commission. But because they get to strike first, lasting damage can be done long before retractions are made or cases alleging invasion of privacy (surprisingly few so far under the Human Rights Act) come to court. The tabloids' sense of political invulnerability was shown by this summer's treatment of the home secretary, David Blunkett; the only \"public interest\" in putting his private life on display is prurience, coupled with twisted attitudes towards disability.</p> <p>Public bodies are increasingly aware, as Sue Stapely puts it, that \"the legal process often trails along well after reputation has been assassinated by the media\". Stapely is one of a specialist breed of public relations consultants, the crisis manager. She is a solicitor who, as head of public affairs at the Law Society when it was undergoing revolts and bloody convulsions, learned about reputation damage the hard way.</p> <p>Her message to health trusts, social services departments and so on is to plan and prepare: \"Don't give the press an unchallenged run\". Professionals in the public sector are more media savvy than ever, she notes, yet she and her colleagues still get calls from senior managers the day the first adverse report appears, on the eve of a hearing or, worse, the day after the first press coverage of the vexing issue appears. They only ask for support when it becomes clear that their council is not being sympathetically reported. When private firms see the proverbial hit the fan, the need to work on public relations is quickly grasped.</p> <p>Reputation is an asset; in Othello, Shakespeare called it the immortal part. It is worth money and comprehensive performance assessment ranking. Reputation management is now firmly established on the business school curriculum, but it is only recently that public managers have started spending with firms that claim to sustain or turn around the way organisations are perceived - the lottery company Camelot's redemption is hailed as a successful makeover. Kingston upon Hull and the London borough of Hackney are striving to find the formula.</p> <p>Crisis management is something else and, Stapely says, should not be needed if organisations conducted regular and rigorous \"bear trap audits\" to identify which of their activities and staff (or elected members) might be vulnerable to media attention or precipitate a crisis.</p> <p>\"Few organisations have fireproof systems in place to manage their reputations in the event of crisis,\" Stapely says. \"Many strive to assess risks but leave open how they are perceived by the public - the senior manager found downloading child pornography; a claim of sexual discrimination or harassment; a local authority held liable for child abuse by one of its employees; a school sliding down the league tables; a public body facing an allegation of fraud, extravagance or financial impropriety; a tribunal case alleging wrongful dismissal.\"</p> <p>She is no great fan of in-house public sector PR, talking of \"small armies of communications professionals\" who think they can handle media interest unaided. Some believe you cannot sup with the devil and that the best response to media assault is silence or escape. No, she says: brief the journalists, talk them through it, respond to their calls, be available day and night.</p> <p>She recommends preparing summaries of issues in dispute if there is a court or tribunal case. Journalists love a good summary; give them a brief description of the organisation and a cast list of witnesses and protagonists. \"These tools are seized upon gratefully by journalists and immediately demonstrate the confident, accessible approach of the organisation,\" she says.</p> <p>\"When Newcastle city council found itself facing a major defamation suit, involving former employees who had been accused of abusing small children in their care, its new chief executive brought in reputation management advisers early, was courageous in taking full responsibility, admitting that the matter had not been handled well in the past, and convening a press conference immediately after judgment had been given and dealing candidly with all inquiries.\"</p> <p>He and the council had to live through 48 hours of bruising press exposure, but eventually it was recognised, Stapely says, that \"the authority had acted well and honourably in the most difficult circumstances\".</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Sue Stapely writes in this month's edition of Public, the Guardian's new monthly for public sector executives, published today.

  "<p>Only professional jeremiahs of overpopulation, such as Crispin Tickell and Jonathan Porritt, noticed the forecast last week that Britain would have 4 million extra people by 2025, plus a further 1.5 million by 2050 - a 10% rise in the lifetime of our children. The UK is the only major European population still growing. </p> <p>Public debate on population is so preoccupied with the social impact of immigration that nobody asks how we will support 66 million consumers of energy, housing and driving space on the roads. Already we have 631 people per square mile in the UK (993 in England) - more than twice as many as France, and the highest density in Europe after the Netherlands. China's population density is 352. </p> <p>Yet the new forecast from the US-based Population Reference Bureau attracted no comment from our government, which has barely begun to shape a population policy, as distinct from an immigration policy, which it says sets \"no upper limits\". </p> <p>Tickell and Porritt are patrons of the Optimum Population Trust (OPT), which takes a deeper look at the issue. It argues that the government's hopes for sustainable development in food, clean water, healthy soil and a stable climate will be dashed if the population is not reduced from 60 million to 52.5 million by 2050, and possibly to 30 million by 2121. </p> <p>The OPT demands firm action against unintended pregnancies, particularly among teenagers, and extra support for the raising of small families. The average British woman chooses to have 1.7 children; in Italy and Spain it is 1.2. </p> <p>Unabashed at sharing some opinions with the British National Party, the UK Independence Party and the Daily Mail, the OPT wants net immigration brought down to zero. Immigration has been the main contributor to recent UK population growth and is projected to account for more than 80% of future growth. </p> <p>Two years ago, 360,000 people left the UK and 513,000 came in - a net immigration of 153,000. The government expects the influx to be lower when the figures for 2003 are released, but natural increase - the excess of births over deaths - is expected to rise from 62,500 in 2002 to 83,000. </p> <p>The OPT has been a voice in the wilderness, but in recent weeks officials have begun replying to its emails and even inviting its input on the future of farming. Tickell, who is director of Oxford's Green College environmental policy centre, does not support OPT's ambition to reduce net immigration to zero, but he does want to stem the flow by discouraging migrants and refugees from coming to Europe. He argues: \"We should give aid at the European level to the countries where refugees originate - especially aid in population policies.\" </p> <p>Porritt agrees that most of the expected increase will be caused by immigration, \"plus a bit of demographic pressure\". But, unlike the OPT, he accepts the government's current immigration policy for humanitarian reasons and because immigrants will help the economy. \"I don't think they're letting too many people in,\" he says. \"Population talk is far too tied up with immigration and racism. The fact is that we are nearly in balance. We're not showing hundreds of thousands coming in.\" </p> <p>Porritt, who drafted the Ecology party's demographic policy in 1976, can claim to be the doyen of the population prophets. Now, as chairman of the Sustainable Development Commission, he is an influential critic who blames the government for not having a population policy. </p> <p>\"The next sustainable development strategy paper is due in March, but will population even feature in it? This government is not doing enough to make a difference. We need more energetic policies on fertility management, which could give us a net reduction even with the present rate of immigration. People should be made to understand that their commitment to the world includes not having too many children.\" </p> <p>The OPT appears relatively untroubled that its two famous patrons disagree with its aim to stop immigration in its tracks. The trust's starkest warnings come from its research coordinator, Andrew Ferguson, a retired airline pilot who calculates that Britain will only be sustainable when its population is brought down to 20 million or, at most, 30 million. \"Only by extravagant use of fossil fuel can we support 60 million people, let alone 65 million,\" Ferguson says. \"As we run out, we will have to go back to old methods of making energy, and that will need lots more space - wood burning, hydroelectric and, to a far lesser extent, wind and solar.\" </p> <p>Most OPT pundits belittle the prospects of renewable energy - \"too many energy fantasists\", says Ferguson. Most accept the revival of nuclear power as inevitable, but insist that the drawbacks, especially the hazards of radioactive waste, make it a least-worst option and no substitute for curbs on population. </p> <p>Ferguson, who sits on teenage pregnancy panels, points out that, with 40,000 such births a year, the UK leads Europe in the field, \"beating even Holland - and we are six times worse than Holland\". </p> <p>The trust shows little embarrassment at sharing some of its platform with anti-immigrant agitators. \"We have nothing in common with the racists, and if there are social problems of immigration we don't get into that,\" says John Guillebaud, researcher in reproductive health at University College London, who is co-chair of OPT. \"Genuine asylum seekers and others reasonably admitted can be black, khaki, purple or green, as long as we bring immigration and emigration into balance and control teenage pregnancies over five to six generations. Given the below-replacement average family size chosen by women in this country, that could bring the UK to 30 million by 2130.\" </p> <p>He agrees that restricting immigration could worsen Britain's already problematic age structure, and \"we may give up economic advantage in excluding potential workers who are promising, or willing to do jobs we ourselves don't want to do - but here the end would justify the means: we have to think of the bigger picture. Increasing the population of a seriously overcrowded country is just crazy.\" </p> <p>Rosamund McDougal, a family planning expert and a co-chair of OPT, argues that the race issue is \"simply irrelevant\". </p> <p>\"I'd rather have 40 million people in the UK and half of them black than 100 million all white,\" she says. \"We can't affect the death rate - we can't go around shooting people. What we can do is cut down unwanted births and immigration that we cannot sustain.\" </p> <p>At last, she thinks, the message is getting through to government. \"We were unheard of, our emails got no reply, then the penny dropped,\" she says. \"Defra [the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] used to be hostile, but now wants our input on rural scenarios; we argue that the notion of farmers as paid keepers of the landscape is nonsense because we're going to need the land for energy.\" </p> <p>Best of all, a letter arrived from the Treasury promising that the current review of the sustainable development strategy will \"consider what the challenges are, including in relation to trends in population and lifestyles\". </p> <p>Has the penny dropped?</p>"
