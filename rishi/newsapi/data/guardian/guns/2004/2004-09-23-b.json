  "I am very much in love with my boyfriend of four years. I am 29 and he is slightly younger than me. We are happy together and are currently trying to establish ourselves and focus on our careers. The problem is that whereas I would like to have children in the next five years, he is dead set against ever having them. He has very strong feelings about it and when I got pregnant accidentally last year he made these very clear. I terminated the pregnancy because neither of us had any money or steady jobs at the time, but my final decision was based on his absolute opposition to it emotionally. After a nine-month split we have resumed our relationship because we still love each other. Nevertheless, this issue is constantly at the back of my mind. Should I call it quits now and make myself available for other potential partners or should I just hope he changes his mind as time goes on at the risk of sacrificing my need to have children? <p><b> Vasectomy puzzle </b><br> </p> <p> It always strikes me as paradoxical when men who refuse to have children never seem to get around to having vasectomies. If they are so sure, why not make it permanent? At least potential partners would have a definite answer to the \"I never want children\" scenario and would avoid the tragic situation of terminating pregnancies under emotional duress. </p> <p> Name and address withheld </p> <p><b> I had an abortion too</b><br> </p> <p>I had a very similar experience to you; the relationship was a couple of years old and we had little security in our employment and accommodation at the time. However, the overriding reason for my abortion was his absolute insistence that he did not want children. </p> <p>We spent a further 11 years together attaining good jobs and a nice house, yet his stance on the \"no kids\" front remained the same. When our relationship ended, he went on to marry and produce two children, while I have remained childless. Don't wait - it can all too quickly become too late. </p> <p>Name and address withheld </p> <p><b> I left my boyfriend </b><br> </p> <p>Take control and give yourself a chance to have the life you deserve. Wanting children is a normal, human desire and one that most men share. I split up with my boyfriend earlier this year over this issue. Since then I have felt in control of my life again and have realised how he had been blighting it. </p> <p>Name and address withheld </p> <p><b> Leave him - now</b><br> </p> <p>Your boyfriend has told you he doesn't want children and shown you that he can't be persuaded otherwise. Believe him and get out now - don't waste your attractive years on a relationship that will end in tears. </p> <p>CC, Manchester </p> <p><b>Is his problem you?</b><br> </p> <p>Four years ago, my partner had an abortion despite my protests. One reason she cited was that financially, it wasn't the right time, although we were both in full-time jobs and had saved enough money for a deposit for a flat. </p> <p>What happened amplified my belief that she thought that I wasn't good enough to build her future with. It was the first time I had seriously thought about having children; ultimately I realised that I did want to have a family and I eventually ended the relationship. </p> <p>I have since met someone else and she is now pregnant. We both expressed a desire for a family and saw each other as the person to do this with. You need to establish if your partner really doesn't want children or simply doesn't want children with you . </p> <p>If his feelings are as clear-cut as you suggest, then you need to think about whether you can sustain a long-term relationship when there is such potential for future resentment and bitterness. </p> <p>WM, Hounslow </p> <p><b> He is being selfish</b><br> </p> <p>I have known three couples in this situation and in each case the husband did not change his mind and in two cases the marriage ended in divorce. You say you both love each other but you have already discovered that he will put his own wishes firmly before yours. Don't waste any more time on this relation-ship - he is not the man for you. </p> <p>MH, Bath </p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>My daughter's father left when she was four. Over the years, he has become increasingly hostile to me. There have been varying degrees of contact between father and daughter. She thrived on regular but limited contact with him last year, but we have since had a court order imposed on us which has significantly increased the amount of time she spends with him and his new family. </p> <p>My daughter loves her father but does not want overnight stays. She prefers to be at home with us; she loves my partner and life is very stable here. </p> <p>She does not feel safe with her stepmother, which intensifies her anxiety. Her father will not consider mediation and does not appear to understand the detrimental effect this ongoing hostility is having on his child. </p> <p>How can I reduce the impact of so much negativity on my daughter? How can I protect her and help her to cope?</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Private Lives appears every Friday. Each week we publish a letter to which readers are invited to respond.

  "On the road to Koramangala, a group of workmen in hard hats stand staring into a six metre deep hole. A line of cars clogs the tree-lined street, engines idling in the sun. <p>TR Ravichandran drives 40kms each day in and out of Koramangala, the heart of Bangalore and the software capital of India. \"The whole city is coming to a halt,\" said the IT worker. \"My journey to the office used to take 45 minutes, but now lasts two hours. </p> <p>\"My wife works at the southern edge of the city, and she has the same problem. </p> <p>\"When we are leaving home at seven and coming home at nine or 10 at night, what chance is there of a decent family life?\" </p> <p>More than 100 firms from outside India, including Microsoft, Google and Reuters, set up offices in Bangalore last year. Hundreds more have farmed out white-collar work such as call centres to Indian companies in the city. Drawn by a booming economy and a temperate climate, a large slice of middle-class India is setting up home in this high-technology hub. The result is that Bangalore is Asia's fastest growing city, albeit one that is unable to cope with the speed of its own progress. </p> <p>Behind the facade of gleaming steel towers, shopping malls and industrial parks, lies a conurbation groaning under traffic jams, power cuts and spiralling property prices. \"We are simply unable to deal with this form of rapid urbanisation. There are 60,000 unfilled potholes on Bangalore's roads, and yet we are seeing more and more families in the city with two cars. This kind of development is not sustainable,\" said Abdul Aziz, a professor and former member of the planning board of Karnataka, the southern state of which Bangalore is the capital. </p> <p>The city's software industry will this year bring in the equivalent of \u00a33.3bn in revenue; it has become increasingly concerned and vocal that its future cash flow is disappearing because of inaction by the state and city governments. </p> <p>Mike Weston, managing director of Logica, a British software company, warned reporters last week that Bangalore's infrastructure was \"deteriorating\" with potentially disastrous results. </p> <p>Another multinational, Philips, said there was a dire need for an international airport and a new railway. \"[Instead] we have no projects and no results here,\" said the head of the company's Bangalore operations, Bob Hoekstra. </p> <p>Critics point out that although it is nearly five months since state elections, the state government has yet to decide who is going to be the IT minister - when Bangalore accounts for nearly half of the India's hi-tech exports. A Congress coalition retained control of the state and hence city, in voting which reflected national issues. </p> <p>To escape what they see as state government indifference and run-down infrastructure, many \"new economy\" companies have built their own campuses on the southern fringes of the city. </p> <p>Far from the Bangalore's crowded narrow streets and alleys, there are wide empty roads, stand-alone water tanks, back-up generators, and back-ups for the back-ups. </p> <p>The gleaming 28 hectare campus of Infosys, a \u00a31bn IT company, in the south of the city has a golf green, basketball courts, a Domino's Pizza and four staff canteens. Work is being completed on the site's 41st office building, and another 10,000 workers will join this year. </p> <p>But the industry says it cannot indefinitely insulate itself from the city's shortcomings. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, India's richest man, Azim Premji, warned that his company, Wipro, would move work outside the city because of \"quality of life issues\". </p> <p>\"I can't have my employees sitting in traffic when they should be in the office. The government needs to act to sort these things out. Frankly it is embarrassing when there are power cuts during one hour of discussion with clients,\" he said. </p> <p>City administrators say that Bangalore is a victim of its own success. MK Shankarlinge Gowda, the senior civil servant in the information technology ministry, points out that a decade ago Bangalore was a city of 2 million people with a million vehicles, whereas today it has a population of 6m and 3m vehicles. \"These are the problems of being perhaps too successful. But we are doing what we can for all the people in the city. IT companies could themselves help by building housing for their workers near their offices.\" </p> <p>Campaigners however say that the problem lies not with industry or government but with the state's citizens. </p> <p>Ramesh Ramanathan is a former Wall Street banker who returned to Bangalore and set up a civic movement, Janaagraha, with \u00a3500,000 of his own money three years ago, to encourage voters to demand greater accountability and effectiveness from their government. </p> <p>\"The problem here is that there is no civic responsibility for the garbage collection, bad roads, water supply. There are 1m properties in Bangalore, but fewer than half pay taxes. The result is that we collect only 2bn rupees (\u00a324m) in revenue rather than 6bn (\u00a372m).\" </p> <p>Mr Ramathan, who lived in America and Britain for a decade but came back so that his children could get to know their grandparents, says that, in the west, urban democracy works because people demand better services and eject politicians who fail to deliver. With half of India set to live in cities by 2020, he says the need to engage urban voters is urgent. \"Not until people start paying taxes and asking politicians for results will anything change here. And we do not have long in India. </p> <p>\"What Bangalore is experiencing today, the rest of the country will feel tomorrow.\"</p>",
  "Turkey's application to join the EU was boosted yesterday when a row over a law criminalising adultery was resolved. <p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister, said in Brussels that a revised penal code would be introduced to parliament in Ankara at an emergency session on Sunday. </p> <p>All references to proposals to outlaw adultery, which were inserted into the legislation by conservative members of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), would be dropped. </p> <p>\"No item which is not already included in the draft of the Turkish criminal code will be included and I mean by that the issue of adultery,\" Mr Erdogan told a news conference. </p> <p>G\u00fcnter Verheugen, the EU's enlargement commissioner, indicated that the European commission intends to give Turkey the go-ahead for formal talks for entry when it publishes a recommendation for its progress report on October 6. The final decision would be made by the EU's leaders in December. </p> <p>Turkey, overwhelmingly Muslim and with a population of 70 million, has been a candidate country since 1999. No country which has begun negotiations on joining has failed to meet the EU's requirements. </p> <p>\"The assurances I received today ... will allow me to make a very clear recommendation [on the start of entry talks],\" Mr Verheugen said at a joint press conference, with Mr Erdogan, after their meeting. </p> <p>The EU had required Turkey to incorporate the new penal code, which reinforces women's rights, bans \"honour killings\" and increases penalties for torture and rape, into law in order to satisfy its standards on human rights. </p> <p>Mr Verheugen did not reveal what the formal recommendation would say, but he praised Turkey's reform efforts and said \"no remaining outstanding obstacles remained on the table\". </p> <p>He also said he was confident, following additional checks by commission officials, that there was no basis for accusing Turkey of \"systematic torture\". </p> <p>Mr Erdogan jeopardised his country's long term quest for European membership earlier this month when he threatened to drop the whole penal code package. </p> <p>He has already driven through reforms such expand ing language rights, abolishing the death penalty and reducing the political role of the military, which were requested by Brussels. </p> <p>Yesterday he sought to reassure EU leaders, many of whom would relish an opportunity to capitalise on Ankara's difficulties, that he was prepared to make the necessary arrangements. </p> <p>\"We are implementing all our reforms very seriously ... We are very resolute on this,\" he said. </p> <p>It had been assumed the commission would reward Turkey's aspirations, but the surprise inclusion of the law on adultery threatened to derail the synchronised process. The proposal to criminalise adultery was initiated by backbench AKP members. The party's roots lie in Islamist politics. </p> <p>The government initially backed the proposal, partly, it is thought, to soothe more devout factions of the AKP which were disappointed by the party's failure to lift the state's ban on the wearing of Muslim-style headscarves in official places. Women's groups warned that the adultery law would be used almost entirely against wives. </p> <p>The row over legal reforms may be resolved, but doubts among Europe's politicians about Turkey's inclusion in the EU continue to surface. </p> <p>Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the French prime minister, voiced his misgivings yesterday. \"We are not doubting the good faith of Mr Erdogan, but to what extent can today's and tomorrow's governments make Turkish society embrace Europe's human rights values?\" he told the Wall Street Journal. </p> <p>\"Do we want the river of Islam to enter the riverbed of secularism?\" </p> <p>Jacques Toubon, a former French justice minister, said: \"To bring Turkey into the European Union is not consistent with our concept of the European project and it is not good for Europe.\" </p> <p>Earlier this week the commission's president-designate, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, said he hoped for progress on the issue but Turkey was not yet ready for membership.</p>",
  "Against a backdrop of grim news from Iraq and North Ossetia, Italy has been grappling with two disturbing and divisive moral and emotional dilemmas of its own in recent days and weeks. <p>While Britain has been fearing for the safety of Kenneth Bigley, Italy's media has been haunted on a daily basis by speculation about the fate of Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, the two Italian aid-workers taken hostage two weeks ago. Although information has been scarce, national anxiety over the two 29-year-old women led the centre-right magazine <b>Panorama</b> to run a story entitled \"Anatomy of a kidnapping\" on its cover this week. </p> <p>As the country shuddered on Thursday at unconfirmed internet reports that \"the two Simonas\" had been executed, leftwing newspapers reiterated their calls for the US-led coalition to leave Iraq as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"John Kerry didn't have to say it the other day because we all knew already: the situation in Iraq seems now to be unsolvable, and soon it will be unsustainable,\" said the centre-left daily <b>La Repubblica</b> in an editorial calling for withdrawal. \"The 'reconstruction' and the attempts to pacify the country have failed. There is no longer any basis for the idea that in five or six months the worst might be over.\" </p> <p><b>Unita</b> held Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to account for taking his country into an \"illegal\" war in Iraq. It reminded its readers that the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, had said the invasion had been against international law and pointed out: \"Now it has been denounced solemnly and publicly, it is no longer possible to deny that the sham is over.\" </p> <p>The conservative <b>La Stampa</b> was stoic in the face of the threat to Italy's hostages, seeing the \"animal violence that stops at nothing\" in Iraq as a \"reminder of the necessity\" of the \"never-ending war\" and the war on terrorism, which \"unfortunately must go on\". </p> <p>The Vatican newspaper <b>L'Avvenire</b> warned that with each atrocity against hostages, western media outlets were being \"used\" by the militants in Iraq. \"Horror arrives punctually at prime-time, it pours into houses through televisions, it points the symbolic knife of the killer-kidnappers at the brains of the television viewers at the same time as the real knife moves towards the throat of the latest hostage,\" the papers said. \"But is all this inevitable? Is it useful? Who for? It is clear that many rebel and terrorist groups are carrying out the kidnappings and killings just for media impact. Is it really impossible for public and private television channels in the 25 European Union countries to agree not to transmit the images the terrorists have constructed and choreographed to sink a knife into our collective conscience?\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, a particularly Italian debate about morality has occupied those minds not devoting their thoughts to what to do about the Italian hostages and the war in Iraq. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the Italian government tightened the law surrounding fertility treatment, banning research on embryos and limiting fertility treatment to stable, heterosexual couples using their own eggs and sperm. The intention was to help the country shed its reputation as being the \"wild west\" of embryology. But there is now a growing campaign for a referendum to overturn the law, and the media have accused the government of bowing to pressure from the Vatican to restrict treatment. </p> <p><b>Espresso</b> magazine this week said \"the law needs to be abolished\", and published the results of a poll in which 54% of Italians said they would vote to overturn the law in a referendum. </p> <p>Newspapers have demanded the health minister, Girolamo Sirchia, review the controversial law, filling their pages with detailed accounts describing the suffering caused by the law. Politicians of both left and right have formed ad hoc alliances, united by their support for objection to the law as the prospect of a referendum looms. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Giuliano Ferrara, editor of the centre-right, pro-government daily <b>Il Foglio</b>, wrote that \"the referendum has got to be done,\" although his paper called on Italians to uphold the law. \"One of the two fundamental problems of our time (the other is the war) has been entrusted to public debate: that's a good thing,\" the paper said. </p> <p>\"The forces that are worried about bioethical modernisation and eugenics that are unregulated should mobilise. Otherwise they deserve to lose,\" it concluded.</p>",
  "A year-long investigation by Italian prosecutors has uncovered a widespread driving licence scam, in which scores of learners, and drivers who have been banned, have paid for documents. <p>So far, 28 people have been arrested, including 13 transport ministry officials, and there are fears that those who have paid for \"new\" licences include some of the country's most dangerous drivers. </p> <p>More than 100 people are under investigation for buying the licences, but officials think there are many more cases. </p> <p>Under the scheme, first noticed in October 2003, a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,400) bribe would secure an official driver's document. </p> <p>\"Perhaps the most dangerous thing about this for the public,\" said Alberto Viti, leading the investigation, \"is that some have also paid to become driving instructors.\"</p> <p>Nautical skipper's licences have also allegedly been issued without proper tests - but at least there is no evidence that pilot licences have been paid for. </p> <p>In all, some 32 transport ministry officials and driving schools in 18 towns are being investigated by Mr Viti's legal team in Turin. The accused face charges of corruption and abuse of public office. </p> <p>Sixty of the 100 people being investigated for buying licences have had the suspect licences confiscated. But police fear there could be many more, including individuals who have lost their licences for traffic violations or who had repeatedly failed driving tests.</p> <p>This development comes a year after a severe points system was introduced to bring down Italy's high road death toll, the worst in Europe after France. On average, 18 people die every day on Italy's roads and the annual death toll is well over the European average of 11 per 100,000.</p> <p>In Italy, where the car is a crucial status symbol, the risk of losing one's licence had a sobering effect on most. Incidents of speeding dropped and rusty seat belts found a new lease of life. </p> <p>Government figures say the road death toll dropped by 21% in the first three months after the new law came into force. But while outlawed and unfit drivers bribe their way on to the road, Italy will struggle to meet the EU target of halving road accidents by 2010.</p>",
  "<p>This morning Sir Terry Leahy, the chief executive of Tesco, is off to Norway. In the week when the retail colossus he leads has produced eye watering profits - and shown how it is successfully taking the Tesco formula to locations ranging from English suburbia to Shiheung Shihwa in South Korea - it might be assumed he was casting his empire-building eye across the fjords. </p> <p>But he's not. While others might be swilling champagne and indulging in a bit of backslapping to celebrate a splendid week, Leahy really isn't like that. Instead he is flying off to \"do a favour for a mate\" from his university days who now works over there. </p> <p>The man who has led Tesco to its current heights - with 28% of the grocery market, taking \u00a31 out of every \u00a38 spent on the UK high street, with 2,300 stores worldwide and en route to a vast \u00a32bn profit this year - is the most successful retailer in the UK. He is also the polar opposite of the most famous retailer, the flamboyant Philip Green. </p> <p>Leahy brings a whole new meaning to the word deadpan. His face and tone betray no emotion, passion or humour. His critics insist he is an automaton and control freak who is incapable of warmth, small talk or optimism. </p> <p>His restraint was well illustrated with his description of this week's figures showing rocketing sales and profits ahead 28%. While City analysts reached for adjectives like \"excellent\", \"storming\" and \"brilliant\", Leahy selected just plain \"good\" - a word, he explained, that had been alighted upon only after an hour with his most senior colleagues. </p> <p>Lord MacLaurin, Leahy's predecessor in the top seat at Tesco and the man who chose him to take over, is clearly proud of his protege's progress and insists there is a beating heart beneath the uniformly grey suits of the man he calls \"my young Terence\". He adds: \"He is quite a tough guy. You don't immediately warm to him. You've got to get to know him. He does have a good Liverpudlian sense of humour and is an avid Evertonian. But, yes, the first impression is dour.\" </p> <p>Kevin Hawkins, director general of the British Retail Consortium, prefers to quote Churchill. Leahy, he says, \" is a riddle wrapped in mystery inside an enigma\". This week's figures may be Tesco's finest, but Leahy's eyrie says it all about the man at the top. While Tesco's ailing rival Sainsbury occupies a splendid glass and steel office in central London, Leahy's empire is a utilitarian breeze-block sprawl on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. \"The point is,\" says Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the company secretary, \"we don't do swanky at Tesco.\" </p> <p>The tone is set by Sir Terry. The son of a greyhound trainer, brought up in a Liverpool council house, Leahy is a grammar school boy made good and has created a business with the same classless appeal that Marks &amp; Spencer once had. </p> <p>He takes pride in the fact that he can mix with anyone, from any background, with equal ease, despite his almost \u00a33m a year pay packet. But he does admit to being more comfortable with his staff and shoppers than the Whitehall mandarins and City glitterati he also has to deal with. \"You are always most comfortable with the people you have grown up with,\" he says. \"I grew up with the kind of people who work in our stores.\" </p> <p>MacLaurin describes Leahy as \"a team player\", while Neville-Rolfe insists he is \"very much the leader\". Leahy says he can't explain his own management style. \"I don't really analyse myself. I'm challenging, but hopefully in a helping way. I try to establish codes of behaviour and values for the business, and I deal with issues, not personalities\". </p> <p>Leahy spurns all big boys' toys, and while many of his often less successful counterparts glide around in chauffeur-driven luxury, he drives himself to work and around the country for his unannounced Friday store-checking sessions. </p> <p>\"He is among the shrewdest of operators, but he is a modest and unassuming guy,\" says Hawkins. \"I would think the idea of building a big yacht would leave him cold. And the thought of him getting involved in pro bono publico stuff to get into the House of Lords would equally leave him cold.\" </p> <p>He is accused of being standoffish because he gets involved in none of the usual out-of-hours businessmen's activities, like high-profile support for the arts, government task forces, or part-time directorships of other companies. </p> <p>All true, he says, but that is because his family comes first. \"I got this job when we had young children, and there has to be a balance. And my wife is a working professional.\" (She is an NHS doctor). </p> <p>Leahy's first job out of college was as a management trainee at the Co-Op. Colleagues from those days remember him as being a rather harder worker than his peers. He quit to follow his girlfriend to London and landed a job with Tesco. That was 1979, when Ian MacLaurin had already started to revitalise what had become a shabby and downmarket chain. </p> <p>Leahy's talent was spotted, and by the age of 25 he was marketing manager. MacLaurin says he was pinpointed as a possible boss at an early stage. \"He was one of four or five young people we were looking at. They are all on the board now </p> <p>Others remember his aggression, and Leahy now admits he was probably too confrontational. \"I used to be young,\" he explains, \"and I'm Irish, so it was probably fairly predictable. But you grow up, and learn how to motivate people.\" </p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, under the guidance of MacLaurin and his \"Operation Checkout\" strategy, Tesco rebuilt its business and reputation, moving its image upmarket and its stores out of town. Sainsbury's, then the UK's number one grocery retailer, was in its sights. </p> <p>But the recession of the early 1990s took its toll and the company for a while looked clueless about how to get back on track. It was then that Leahy, by then marketing director, had what he has since called his \"crikey moment\", when he realised what was wrong and how to fix it. The problem, he decided, was that they had been trying to be too much like Sainsbury's and had forgotten to put customers first, as Tesco's founder Jack Cohen had with his\"pile-it-high-and-sell-it-cheap\" retail philosophy. </p> <p>Leahy's first reaction was a new Value line of cheap basics, and then he gave us the Tesco Clubcard, derided by Sainsbury's as \"electronic green shield stamps\". But it worked wonders, and is a sophisticated marketing tool. </p> <p>Tesco now knows its customers like no other retailer: what they eat and drink, the drugs they take, the size of their boots and bras. By 1995 Tesco had passed Sainsbury's at the top of the supermarket league, and two years later MacLaurin passed the baton to Leahy. He is pleased with his choice. \"He hasn't gone and invested in stupid things,\" he said. </p> <p>What Leahy has done is take Tesco into fashion, entertainment and electricals. He has targeted services - mobile phones and insurance - and built the biggest online grocery business in the world. He has also taken Tesco to 11 new countries, in eastern Europe and Asia. </p> <p>He knows he is walking a tightrope on just how big Tesco can grow before the public turns against it. He tells the City that taking 12.5p out of every \u00a31 spent in the UK leaves him another 87.5p to go for. But competition watchdogs have acknowledged that Tesco's market share could already justify a monopoly investigation. \"It could happen,\" he says. \"We have to be prepared.\" </p> <p>He also has to keep expanding into new areas; more clothing and homewares, maybe mortgages, maybe cars. And he has to keep rolling out abroad: China is next on the radar. </p> <p>So what will be his next trick? After he has popped up at the odd Downing Street do, there are those who see him in a quasi-political role. He was once tipped as next head of the NHS. </p> <p>Leahy finds it all a bit embarrassing, insisting his ideas are \"nothing grand,\" and that his focus is Tesco, Tesco ... and Tesco. MacLaurin is more forthright. The prospect of his Terence switching careers, he laughs, \"is about as likely as me climbing Everest tomorrow\". </p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong> Sir Terence Patrick Leahy</strong> </p> <p><strong> Born </strong> February 28 1956 </p> <p><strong> Education </strong> St Edward's College, Liverpool; Umist </p> <p><strong> Family</strong> Married with three children </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> Tesco marketing executive, 1979; marketing manager, 1981; marketing director, 1984-86; commercial director of fresh foods, 1986-92; marketing director, 1992-95 (appointed to board); deputy managing director, 1995-97; chief executive, 1997- </p> <p><strong> Other interests </strong> Chancellor, Umist; director, Liverpool Vision (an urban regeneration company), and Everton FC </p> <p><strong> On his early years</strong> \"My brothers all left school at 16, but my parents worked very hard so that I could stay on and do my A-levels\"</p>",
  "<p>You wait your whole life to meet a beautiful and glamorous woman with an exhaustive knowledge of pop history, and then three come along at once. The Concretes - so called because their hometown of Stockholm has a lot of the stuff - were formed in 1999 when school friends Lisa Milberg and Maria Eriksson met Victoria Bergsman at art school, and the three bonded over a shared love of clothes and rock'n'roll. \"When it was us three girls we did rockabilly songs,\" says Milberg, the band's drummer and its most vocal member. \"Mainly because we liked the look of the 50s. We used to look great, and rockabilly songs are extremely easy, which was another good thing, considering how crap we were. Then we got better and the boys came along.\" </p> <p>Maria Eriksson, who plays guitar for the eight-piece band, cannot be with us today as the interview clashes with her brunch hour, so fellow guitarist Daniel Varjo takes her place. The supremely confident Milberg holds court, but singer and songwriter Bergsman is so shy that forcing her to talk begins to feel rather sadistic after a while. Both, however, clearly get a great deal of pleasure from making Varjo own up to the fashion follies of his youth. \"I really liked Motley Crue, Guns N'Roses, Poison, Hanoi Rocks ... all the heavy metal bands from Los Angeles in the 1980s who wore a lot of makeup.\" </p> <p>\"Tell him about your appearance,\" commands Milberg, causing Bergsman to giggle. \"I had long hair in a ... I think it is called a permanent,\" he says with the resigned air of a man used to such treatment. \"I started playing guitar after I got the perm. In fact, there was a Swedish pop-metal band called Europe that had a hit with a song called The Final Countdown. It was the solo in that song that made me start playing the guitar.\" </p> <p>\"That was much more information than I needed to know,\" says Milberg, shaking her head. \"You should stop now.\" But Milberg has started something she cannot finish. \"Actually, the guitar solo in The Final Countdown was pretty hard,\" Varjo reflects. \"I never managed to play it properly. Perhaps now, after all these years, I could do it. We really should include it at our next show in London.\" </p> <p>It's unlikely, though, that the girls are going to allow Varjo to steer the Concretes in a new perm-metal direction. Their debut album is filled with bright, romantic pop songs with touches of the Velvet Underground in their softer moments, and the three original members have a very clear idea about what they want. They had full control over the making of the album, from the way it was recorded to the cover artwork, and the girls - even, occasionally, the reserved Bergsman - are very enthusiastic about the music they like. \"I have been into every musical scene there is over the years,\" she says. \"But I have always been fond of singers with big voices, like Roy Orbison.\" </p> <p>\"I think I grew up in the wrong time,\" says Milberg. \"It made me really sad that I only liked music by dead guys because I never felt like a proper teenager. I was always crazy about Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Neil Young. and the Band ... all the 70s musicians that your parents would like.\" </p> <p>Bruce Springsteen's Greetings From Asprey Park is Varjo's favourite record. \"My parents are divorced, and my dad listened to Born in the USA in the car when he came to pick me up,\" he says. \"I had to buy all the records by Springsteen after that, and he is really great ... much better than his image suggests.\" </p> <p>Milberg and Bergsman are evangelical about a Brighton-based all-female band called Electrelane. \"They have a song called The Valleys which, if there was any justice in the world, would change the way music was made,\" says Milberg. \"It's a long time since I have heard something so innovative. The girl who writes the songs plays saxophone, organ, guitar, piano, and she sings. You are not meant to be able to play that many different instruments! On The Valleys they have a huge choir, and it sounds like 50 guys singing their hearts out.\" </p> <p>Milberg runs a club in Stockholm that specialises in gentle music by singer-songwriters of the 60s and 70s, and one of the bands she plays there is the obscure but cultish Welsh 70s duo Young Marble Giants. \"I am obsessed with two things: them and Robert Wyatt,\" she explains. \"There is very little going on in their music - just a drum machine, some strange sounds and the woman's singing - but it is remarkable. They recorded everything in their home and it sounds timeless.\" </p> <p>\"Too bad we don't have any records by the Modern Lovers here, as they are my favourite band,\" says Bergsman suddenly. \"And I really love Tim Hardin.\" She looks as if she might build on this statement, but instead she returns to her natural state of silence. \"We all like soul music,\" offers Varjo. \"Everybody likes soul music,\" counters Milberg dismissively. \"It is against the law not to. It is called 'soul', after all - and everybody has a soul.\" </p> <p>Sweden has a very enlightened attitude towards music, which might help explain why the country produces so many bands. Everybody is entitled to free music tuition; there are youth clubs with electric guitars and turntables, and most of the population has some degree of proficiency in at least one instrument. In such an environment, soul music is everywhere. Milberg's favourite soul track is Walking Up a One-Way Street by Willie Tee. \"This is the second-best song ever written,\" she announces. What is the first? \"Something's on Your Mind by Karen Dalton. She only made two records, and she didn't like singing so she had to be tricked into going into the recording studio. They told her that they weren't going to release anything she made, which was of course a lie. She has a husky but high-pitched voice that a lot of people don't like, but it is wonderful.\"</p>",
  "<p>The recent stock market rally, on both sides of the Atlantic, promised to take the FTSE 100 and the Dow Jones up and out of the tight trading range in which these indices have been stuck for the best part of two years. </p> <p>Sadly, it seems to have come to a juddering halt. </p> <p>Over the past six weeks, as the Footsie powered more than 7% higher from an August trough, prices were generally considered to be underpinned by a casual but widespread expectation that the price of oil would soon start to fall. </p> <p>Instead, Brent crude has stuck hard in the mid-$40 range and only weakened a tad yesterday when a US administration official was quoted as suggesting that the Americans might release some of its contingency reserves to meet persistently high demand for oil. </p> <p>Indeed, a warning yesterday from Swedish home appliances group Electrolux that sky-high commodities prices would hit profits served as a cross-market reminder that while headline growth might look impressive across many of the big economies, pressure on corporate profit margins is not going away. </p> <p>So, with stock prices heading south once more, it was a moment yesterday for another dose of gloom from our favourite London bear, Albert Edwards of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. </p> <p>\"The shift in market sentiment that has been occurring since June may now accelerate sharply, catalysed by the realisation that the profits cycle is disintegrating,\" Edwards declared. </p> <p>\"And while Greenspan frets about his place in history, we can see the markets reacting to the reality they see on the ground, rather than Comical Al's bullish propaganda.\" </p> <p>The Kleinwort man is developing an increasingly abusive rhetoric against what many consider to be the greatest central banker of the modern age: \"As Alan Greenspan fights forlornly to convince investors that all is well and that his soon-to-end tenure at the Fed has been a success, his propaganda will increasingly become so detached from reality that he risks being regarded with the same bemusement as ... the Iraqi information minister ...\" </p> <p>Funny that. We always thought Edwards was the comical one. </p> <p><strong> Old school Barclays </strong><br> </p> <p> One reason the market in London was especially strong earlier this week was the performance of Barclays, whose price seemed to be defying gravity. </p> <p>We now know why - and a distinct smell of burning flesh wafted across City trading desks; the \"deal\" which half-insiders were chasing so excitedly turned out to be Barclays doing the acquiring, rather than the other way round. </p> <p>Information was sketchy yesterday, since the British bank was obviously forced into a premature statement by leaks in Johannesburg. But the move appears to signal an intriguing shift in strategy. </p> <p>The very fact that Barclays is going back to South Africa after all these years suggests newly promoted chief executive John Varley has an altogether different vision of Barclays' future than so much speculative money in London had assumed. </p> <p>Fixated by the swashbuckling style of Varley's predecessor, Matt Barratt, for some time now the betting has been that Barclays would either take a colossal risk and try to build the first substantial pan-European financial group, or the bank would be merged with a big American combine. </p> <p>Varley is a British establishment banker. Buying control of Absa feels like an old school deal. </p> <p><strong> Taxing time </strong><br> </p> <p> An entertaining spat has developed between the accounting and legal professions over whether they have to comply with the anti-tax evasion provisions introduced in this year's budget. </p> <p>Believe it or not, while accountants will have to get Inland Revenue clearance for the tax avoidance packages which they hawk around companies and wealthy individual clients, law firms are claiming they do not have to disclose anything at all. </p> <p> According to Accountancy Age - a trade publication that is clearly limbering itself up for what it describes as a \"battle of epic proportions\" - the Law Society has told all its members that if they give advice on tax measures it is protected by privilege and does not have to be revealed to the authorities. </p> <p>The Revenue seems to be taking a softly, softly approach to the matter, indicating that talks with the Law Society are continuing and the rules should be able to operate without requiring the disclosure of privileged information. </p> <p>That may be the case, but with the new disclosure regime set to take effect in just one week's time, it is possible to see why the accountants are getting so agitated. </p> <p>Advising on how to avoid tax is a big, lucrative business - and the accounting firms could be about to see it fly out of the window. </p> <p>More importantly, the prospect of shabby lawyers offering to mis-use the privileges which come with their position so they can sell schemes to tax dodgers is just beyond the pale. </p> <p>Clearly, there's a need for some robust legislation on all this.</p>",
  "<p>A humiliating Champions League debut seen from the bench, a dressing-room revolt, and a manager who walked after just four matches, to be replaced by the goalkeeping coach. Michael Owen must be wondering what he has let himself in for. And that despite almost certainly being unaware of his own central role in events that, with admirable restraint, he describes as \"strange\". </p> <p>If only David Beckham, or even Steve McManaman, had warned him. For, while Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho lost the players, much of Madrid's ills, including fractious relations, have far deeper roots - the product of a presidential policy obsessed with marketing, trained only on the gal\u00e1cticos . One that, unbeknownst to him, made Owen, the latest star-signing, the eye of the storm. </p> <p>Two defeats hardly constitute a full-on crisis, but such reverses as that dished out by Bayer Leverkusen are not new; and neither are the circumstances that sparked Camacho's resignation. \"My team-mates assured me that it's not always like this,\" Owen said. He should treat such information with caution. </p> <p>After all, there have been uprisings before and last season Madrid - the white angels, the loudly self-proclaimed greatest club in the world - won nothing at all (and registered a club-record-five successive defeats). And while president Florentino P\u00e9rez leapt eagerly upon Carlos Queiroz for a scapegoat, his autocratic model was pernicious and Madrid's problems profound. </p> <p>A bruising club legend, Camacho was central to P\u00e9rez's summer election campaign, his brilliantly engineered political saviour, the man who would impose discipline and bring down the capricious, bloated superstar image that infuriated fans. A culture that spawned white hankies, jeers and even last season an indiscriminate 30-foot banner reading: \"For you, whores and money, for us indignation.\" But, handily for P\u00e9rez, it was one that shifted attention to players and coach. </p> <p>He said it couldn't happen with Camacho. But despite apparent changes, the internal circumstances have repeated themselves. Camacho represented Madrid's PR-driven managerial ideal type. But the model has changed four times in three years: from the understated, old-school psychology of Vicente Del Bosque, to the modernity, low profile and worldly charm of Queiroz, to the raw tub-thumping of Camacho, and now, with Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem \u00f3n, back to Del Bosque, moustache and all. </p> <p>Camacho was never likely to succeed, too blunt, too domineering to win over a dressing room used to power. Nonetheless, the player power influence needs some deflating, even if it was the detonator this time; it is but a product of the unique way Madrid is run and Camacho's relationship with P\u00e9rez was little better. </p> <p>Already a difficult environment to enter, harder still to withstand, Madrid was more complicated by Owen's arrival. Another superstar, yet different this time; even P\u00e9rez didn't seem as enamoured as usual. He had turned him down earlier, but would never - never, never, never - let a summer pass without the obligatory gal\u00e1ctico, returning to the Liverpool striker as other doors closed. </p> <p>Compensation came with the price, just \u00a38m, a Ballon d'Or , and his nationality; Beckham had shown Madrid how lucrative the English market could be. A deal with BP followed. </p> <p>But if P\u00e9rez wasn't totally convinced, Camacho, who wanted Patrick Vieira, was even less so. It wasn't that he didn't rate Owen, but he couldn't find him a place. How could he drop Ronaldo or Ra\u00fal? And he'd promised Fernando Morientes time on the pitch. It dawned on Camacho, a man who demands control, that apparent change was illusory; like Queiroz and Del Bosque, his hands were tied. From all sides. </p> <p>Previous gal\u00e1cticos had roles to play; Owen's arrival posed a threat to Madrid's core - to their captain Ra\u00fal and existing stars - bringing to the boil simmering discontent. It is emphatically not about Owen personally or professionally, however, but what he represents. And with his linguistic limitations, the new boy was both blameless and surely ignorant of his centrality. \"Obviously I don't know all their conversations because of the language problem,\" he admits. </p> <p>Some senior foreign players were irritated that Owen remained a sub while Ra\u00fal continued to perform poorly, but when the Englishman immediately leapfrogged the eternally shunted Morientes in the substitutes' queue and then, against Espanyol, replaced the captain, the touchpaper was truly lit. </p> <p>Camacho was accused by a faction comprising Guti, Ra\u00fal and Morientes of bowing to media and marketing pressure. And when the coach discovered they had run to P\u00e9rez, who did not defend him, he walked, lamenting that until culture and priorities change Madrid will ever be thus. The news that Adidas had complained about Beckham being dropped merely confirmed Camacho's belief - and illustrated just what Michael Owen has walked into. Welcome to Real Madrid.</p>",

  "<p>BBC3 controller Stuart Murphy has taken the almost unprecedented decision to pull the plug on controversial cartoon comedy Popetown after complaints from the Catholic church.</p> <p>He has admitted that \"on balance\" the show would cause strong offence to practising Catholics.</p> <p>But the move fuelled immediate speculation of interference by the BBC's new director general Mark Thompson, a practising Catholic.</p> <p>MediaGuardian has learned that Mr Thompson discussed the programme with the Archbishop of Birmingham, Vincent Nichols, and his press secretary, Peter Jennings, at a BBC event just two weeks ago where the pair put pressure on him to drop the show.</p> <p>\"The archbishop and I were there as guests and we were keen to see Mark because he attends one of our churches,\" said Mr Jennings today.</p> <p>\"I said to him what we want to see is a situation where the BBC wouldn't treat the Catholic church in a way that would not be acceptable for Judaism or Islam. At the moment the Catholic church is easy game.</p> <p>\"My opinion was that this was a French programme and it might not translate into English so there was a perfect excuse to pull it on that basis,\" Mr Jennings added.</p> <p><strong>Mark Thompson is 'more receptive to Catholic view'</strong><br></p> <p>Mr Thompson gave no specific commitment on the programme, according to Mr Jennings. But he replied that he was now the director general of the BBC - a comment Mr Jennings took to mean that while he could not do anything about previous coverage of Catholicism on the BBC, he was now in a position to take action.</p> <p>Asked whether he believed the current regime was more receptive to the arguments of the Catholic church, Mr Jennings replied: \"Significantly so. We are not looking for special treatment. But Mark Thompson's a practising Catholic and his number two Mark Byford is also a Catholic.\"</p> <p>Archbishop Nichols, who has been strongly critical of several BBC programmes on the Catholic church in the past, welcomed today's decision.</p> <p>\"I am reassured that this decision demonstrates genuine sensitivity on the part of the BBC to the faith and deeply held convictions of many people,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I am sure that this decision will help to build confidence between the Catholic Church and the BBC under its new chairman and director general.\"</p> <p>The series, which has been planned for over a year, portrays a childish fictional pope who pogo-sticks around the Vatican.</p> <p>The 10-part animated series billed by the BBC as an \"office comedy set in the Vatican\", portrayed the Pope and his immediate entourage as a bunch of childish, bickering, back-stabbers.</p> <p>Ruby Wax provides the voice of the Pope and other characters in Popetown are voiced by Jerry Hall, Kevin Eldon, Morwenna Banks, Matt Lucas and MacKenzie Crook.</p> <p>Popetown was made by Channel X - the independent producer behind shows including Shooting Stars - in association with Phil Ox, of French producer Moi J'Aime La Television.</p> <p>Mr Murphy's self-censorship move, which has been endorsed by BBC director of TV Jana Bennett and Mr Thompson, means that Popetown will never be broadcast on digital youth BBC3, or any other of the corporation's public service TV networks.</p> <p>However, the BBC's decision to abandon the programme because of the offence it could cause has been undermined by a statement which says they will try and recoup some of the investment in the programme be selling it to another broadcaster or putting it out on video or DVD.</p> <p>In a statement he admitted he had not ruled out selling Popetown to other broadcasters in the UK - which could included a BBC channel such as UK Gold, which the corporation co-owns with Telewest - and overseas, or making it available to viewers on video and DVD.</p> <p>\"Popetown was a challenging project for BBC3 to undertake. After a lot of consideration and consultation, balancing the creative risk with the potential offence to some parts of the audience, we have decided not to transmit the programme,\" Mr Murphy said.</p> <p>\"Despite all the creative energy that has gone into this project and the best efforts of everyone involved, the comic impact of the delivered series does not outweigh the potential offence it will cause,\" he added.</p> <p>\"It has been an extremely difficult and complex decision to make. There is a fine judgement line in comedy between the scurrilously funny and the offensive. I knew when we developed the series that there was risk involved but unfortunately, once we saw the finished series, it became clear that the programme fell on the wrong side of that line,\" Mr Murphy said.</p> <p>The man behind the series has agreed not to make any comment that has not come via the BBC press office.</p> <p>But in an agreed statement, Alan Marke, head of Channel X Television said: \"I am incredibly disappointed about this decision as I am very proud of this project and all the talent involved. But I understand the world has changed since the series was originally commissioned and sympathise with the difficult decision the BBC has had to make\".</p> <p>A BBC spokeswoman said Mr Murphy had consulted with Ms Bennett, controller of editorial policy Stephen Whittle and head of religion Alan Bookbinder before taking the decision to permanently shelve Popetown.</p> <p>The spokeswoman added that Mr Thompson, BBC chairman Michael Grade and the board of governors had been informed of the decision. Mr Thompson, she said, supported the decision.</p> <p>The BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, has invested in Popetown and it is likely that it would be involved in any video or DVD launch for the show, or a sale to other broadcasters.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Turkey today received strong assurances from the EU that it would be given a green light next month to start talks on joining the bloc. <p>The EU's expansion commissioner, Guenter Verheugen, suggested he is likely to recommend the opening of membership talks after Ankara resolved a dispute over law reforms. </p> <p>\"The assurances I got ... will allow me to make a very clear recommendation\" about when to open the talks, Mr Verheugen said after an hour-long meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan. </p> <p>Although he did not specify what his recommendation would be when he publishes his report on 6 October, Mr Verheugen said that \"there are no more obstacles on the table now.\" </p> <p>The development came after Mr Erdogan agreed to pass law reforms which the EU has said is essential to Turkey meeting entry requirements. </p> <p>The Turkish parliament will hold an emergency session on Sunday to pass the reform package, Mr Erdogan said. \"We will be convening the parliament for an extraordinary meeting,\" he told reporters, adding that his government was \"resolute\" in \"continuing ... revolutionary changes\" in Turkey. </p> <p>The package had been held up in parliament amid disputes over a clause which would have outlawed adultery - a move supported by conservative Islamic groups in Turkey. </p> <p>The EU, which objected to the criminalisation of adultery, had warned against that clause holding up the other reforms in the package, which includes laws against rape, paedophilia and torture, and improves human rights standards. EU officials had said Ankara was unlikely to get the go-ahead to start membership talks without the reform package being approved. </p> <p>\"We have been able to find solutions to the remaining outstanding problems,\" Mr Verheugen said after his meeting with Mr Erdogan. \"There are no further conditions that Turkey must fulfil to enable the European Commission to make a clear recommendation\" about when to begin the talks. </p> <p>The leaders of the 25 EU nations are to make a final decision at a December summit in Brussels on when Ankara can begin membership talks. Even after discussions begin, it could take years of negotiations before Turkey is accepted into the union. </p> <p>There is considerable concern among EU lawmakers and in some EU capitals that making Turkey a member would not be beneficial to the bloc. </p> <p>\"We don't think that we should start negotiations with Turkey,\" said French conservative Jacques Toubon, adding that Turkey gaining membership \"will result in a Europe without a political union.\"</p> <p>Martin Schulz, the German Socialist leader in the EU assembly said, \"I am in favour of Turkish membership ... but not at any price.\" </p> <p>Despite being heavily critical of Turkey's rights record over the years, the European Parliament has traditionally been supportive of Turkey's bid to join the bloc. But elections for the expanded EU assembly last June, with its new Eastern European members, brought in more lawmakers who oppose Ankara's European ambitions. </p> <p>Turkey's entry into the EU became a major voting issue in several member nations, including Germany, where the conservative Christian Democrats gained the most seats in the European Parliament elections due partly to their opposition to starting entry talks with Ankara.</p>",

  "The Foreign Office was today heavily criticised for losing millions of pounds of taxpayers' cash in property deals designed to save money. <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office annual report for 2003-4 cited the worst example as being in New York, where plans to move the consul general from a \u00a312m property and save \u00a36m had instead resulted in a loss of almost \u00a3400,000.</p> <p>Published today by the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, the report raises \"grave concerns\" about the \"asset recycling programme\" brought in by the Treasury in 1998. The programme requires the sale of embassies and other properties abroad to fund investment in new buildings and computer systems.</p> <p>A year ago, the cross-party committee warned that the programme could result in valuable buildings being sold cheaply in order to meet targets, and that the Foreign Office would be left vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates and house prices.</p> <p>In the New York case, the Foreign Office decided in June 2001 that the consul general's house was too large. It had planned to sell the property for around \u00a312.2m and buy a more appropriate residence for around \u00a36.3m.</p> <p>However, the New York housing market slumped following the September 11 terrorist attacks, which severely weakened the dollar. The Foreign Office went ahead and paid the price it had offered for the replacement property, and the consul general subsequently moved into his new home at a total cost of \u00a36.48m.</p> <p>By the time the original residence was sold, however, it only fetched \u00a36.32m - an eventual loss of \u00a3380,000. While the Foreign Office could not have foreseen the September 11 attacks, its decision to proceed with the exchange of contracts on the new property was denounced by the committee as \"utterly bizarre\" and \"reprehensible\".</p> <p>\"This transaction was undertaken for the purpose of realising a gain of approximately \u00a36m, and has instead resulted in the loss of \u00a3380,000 and the replacement of a highly prestigious property by an inferior one,\" the report said.</p> <p>A potential profit of at least \u00a34m was also lost in Dublin after the Foreign Office decided to sell the UK ambassador's residence at Glencairn. The estate and its 34 acres of grounds were sold for \u00a324.3m in 1999 for security and operational reasons.</p> <p>The following year, a property called Marlay Grange was bought for \u00a36.2m, and a further \u00a32.8m was budgeted for security and refurbishment.</p> <p>Following the Good Friday agreement, security considerations became less of an issue and a decision was made to buy Glencairn back, but without its grounds. The purchase cost \u00a37m, but the value of Marlay Grange had meanwhile dropped to \u00a34.3m and, by that time, \u00a3680,000 had already been spent on renovations.</p> <p>Sir Michael Jay, the permanent under secretary at the Foreign Office and the head of the diplomatic service, told the committee that the Dublin deals had resulted in a net gain of \u00a313m. However, the report found that the Glencairn grounds alone could have been sold for \u00a317m in 1999.</p> <p>\"The [Foreign Office's] claimed net gain of \u00a313m from its Dublin property transactions should more accurately have been described as a net gain of at least \u00a317m being reduced by \u00a34m as a result of the department's mistaken decision to sell, only to reacquire, the Glencairn residence and to purchase, only to sell, Marlay Grange,\" it said.</p> <p>The committee also described Foreign Office attempts to prevent MPs from scrutinising its deals as \"utterly indefensible\". </p> <p>\"We conclude that serious mistakes were made during the sale and purchase of residences in Dublin and New York, and should not have occurred,\" it said. \"Such incidents serve to underline the importance of effective scrutiny of the Foreign Office's property transactions by parliament.\"</p> <p>Other concerns raised in the report included the \u00a3120m in savings demanded from the Foreign Office over the next three years in the chancellor's July spending review. </p> <p>The committee also asked the Treasury to fund additional security measures in embassies and high commissions following the death of consul general Roger Short in an attack on the Istanbul consulate last year.</p> <p>\"The efficiency savings ... will place a considerable strain upon the Foreign Office's operations in coming years,\" the report warned. \"Given the [Foreign Office's] significant fixed costs, people-intensive nature and the increasing demands and expectations being placed upon it, we fear that efficiency savings will effectively mean cuts in programme budgets.\"</p> <p>The British Council, the body charged with promoting Britain around the world, was criticised in the report over its new logo. Four pale blue dots on a white background - intended to represent the four countries of the UK - have replaced 49 dots arranged to form the Union Jack.</p> <p>Harking back to British Airways' decision to remove the Union Jack from its planes' tails, the committee said: \"We are concerned that the British Council may be making the same mistake as British Airways in underplaying its Britishness. </p> <p>\"The Union Flag is the most well known and widely recognised symbol of Britain and, as British Airways belatedly realised, it can be presented as part of a modern and dynamic corporate image.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the council rejected the charge, insisting: \"Promoting Britain abroad is not about logos ... having the word British in our name is surely a pretty upfront and strong indication of who we represent.\"</p> <p>He added that the new logo was intended \"to appeal directly to young people abroad who would be attracted to a creative image\".</p>",

  "A public inquiry is to be held into the 1989 murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane, the government announced today. <p>The murder of the 39-year-old Catholic, who successfully represented many top Republicans, including the hunger striker Bobby Sands, has been at the centre of a 15-year investigation into collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces.</p> <p>Ken Barrett, a former police special branch informer and paramilitary, was sentenced to 22 years in prison last week after pleading guilty to the murder and related charges. His conviction led to renewed nationalist demands for a public inquiry into the state's role in the killing.</p> <p>Peter Cory, a retired Canadian judge, was appointed by the government in 2001 to investigate the case. He found documentary proof that MI5, the army and special branch knew about a plot to kill Mr Finucane and failed to act. </p> <p>But when the judge recommended a public inquiry almost a year ago the government postponed any action until all criminal proceedings had been exhausted, saying Barrett's trial could be prejudiced. </p> <p>Announcing the decision to hold an inquiry, Northern Ireland secretary Paul Murphy said today that the government had always been \"determined that where there are allegations of collusion the truth should emerge\". </p> <p>But, he added: \"In the Finucane case, an individual was being prosecuted for the murder. The police investigation by Sir John Stevens [into police collusion with paramilitaries] and his team continued and it was not possible to say whether further prosecutions might follow.\" </p> <p>The government judged that it was safe to go ahead with the inquiry following Barrett's conviction, even though it is still possible that further prosecutions might result from the Stevens investigation. </p> <p>Mr Murphy said: \"Following consultation with the attorney general, who is responsible for the prosecutorial process, the government has considered carefully the case for proceeding to an inquiry. </p> <p>\"In doing so, the government has taken into account the exceptional concern about this case. Against that background, the government has concluded that steps should now be taken to enable the establishment of an inquiry into the death of Patrick Finucane.\"</p> <p>Mr Murphy said new legislation would be introduced to ensure an inquiry could be set up \"speedily and effectively and in a way that takes into account the public interest, including the requirements of national security\".</p> <p>He added: \"As in any inquiry, the tribunal will be tasked with uncovering the full facts of what happened, and will be given all of the powers and resources necessary to fulfil that task.\"</p>",

Generally defined as when a household needs to spend 10% or more of its income on fuel costs, it is estimated that up to three million people in the UK are now classified as being \"fuel poor\". And, according to the NHS, around a third of the 30,000 deaths caused by wintry weather each year are due to respiratory diseases or strokes that are exacerbated by poorly heated homes. The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group warned this year that a 10% price hike - as has recently been witnessed - could push an extra 500,000 people into fuel poverty.

  "<p>The struggling nuclear generator British Energy today sought to remove itself from the stock market in a bid to prevent rebel shareholders from thwarting its recovery plan. </p> <p>BE said it had applied to the UK listing authority and the London stock exchange to end the listing and trading of its ordinary and A class shares, with the move coming a day after the European commission approved a government-backed \u00a35bn rescue plan. </p> <p>Under the restructuring, existing shareholders would get 2.5% of shares in the company, with the rest going to bondholders and other creditors. </p> <p>Some shareholders have opposed the rescue plan, insisting on a better deal because of the recovery of power prices since it was agreed. Polygon Investment Partners, a US hedge fund, has led demands for a drastic revision that would give shareholders a bigger stake.</p> <p>BE has said that, if shareholders succeeded in derailing the package, the company would fall into administration and leave investors with nothing. </p> <p>It said it would not have to delist from the stock exchange if it was sure of winning shareholder backing for the rescue plan. However, creditors are understood to have demanded the delisting to ensure that shareholders cannot block the deal. </p> <p>BE has already begun court action against Polygon in the US in an effort to block it from calling an extraordinary general meeting to table its proposed resolutions. </p> <p>\"We have taken the decision to seek delisting with great reluctance - but it is necessary to safeguard the interests of British Energy,\" Adrian Montague, the BE chairman, said.</p> <p>\"Passing these resolutions puts the company in real danger of administration. The board cannot support this, and we will take what actions we can to protect the company.\" </p> <p>BE, which supplies one fifth of Britain's power, has been kept afloat by a \u00a3650m government loan. The rescue plan was agreed last year, but has taken time to complete because of the need for EU approval.</p> <p>The plan has seen banks and bondholders agree to write off \u00a31.3bn of debt in return for control of the group. As part of the deal, BE pledged to improve its reliability and operational performance as well as securing EU support, because the proposals will see the government meet some decommissioning liabilities. </p> <p>Brussels has approved the package on condition that any state aid is used exclusively to fund the decommissioning of BE's nuclear power stations. </p> <p>The company's biggest plant is at Hartlepool, with others at Heysham, Lancashire; Hinkley Point, Somerset; Hunterston, Ayrshire; Dungeness, Kent; Sizewell, Suffolk, and Torness, East Lothian.

  "If you've got something to say, say it in English. Other languages really don't count any more. <p>Thanks to the old British empire and today's US pre-eminence, English has become the international language of business, technology, diplomacy - and the world's most celebrated writers. </p> <p>Literary stardom \"reflects only the ability of a writer or a book to make an impression on the most profitable areas of the world market,\" Pierre Lepape, the French author and critic, wrote in Le Monde Diplomatique earlier this year. </p> <p>\"An author might win the Nobel prize and be translated into 30 languages, but his or her work does not qualify as world literature until it is piled high on a prominent table in a Barnes &amp; Noble megastore.\" </p> <p>The world market in books is dominated by the US. US publishers and literary agents, together with many of their British counterparts, maximise revenue and profits by promoting star authors who, these days, are often celebrities rather than professional writers. </p> <p>Meanwhile, authors from the rest of the world, with names that are unfamiliar - and sometimes unpronouncable to English speakers - scarcely get a look in. </p> <p>Only 2.8% of the books published in the US are translations from other languages, and no translated book has reached the US bestseller lists for years. The figure for Britain is only marginally higher, standing at 3%. </p> <p>Amid the general reluctance to translate foreign languages into English, books originally written in Arabic seem especially out of favour. Even in Germany, where translations account for 40% of published fiction, less than 0.3 % of those books are by authors from the Arab world. </p> <p>This is somewhat surprising, partly because Arabic, with around 186 million native speakers, is the world's sixth major language, but also because of the enormous political and military attention focused on the Middle East and the way in which the region dominates news coverage day after day, year after year. </p> <p>It is probably fair to say that the average well-educated American or Briton has never read any Arabic literature in translation. If pushed to name an Arab writer, they might - after some head-scratching - come up with Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian Nobel winner, or Kahlil Gibran, the Lebanese mystic. </p> <p>One reason for the dearth of translations could be that Arabic - at least until the events of September 11 - was not generally considered an important language to learn (it's also rather difficult), with the result that there is a shortage of accomplished translators. </p> <p>Another factor is that Arab publishers make little or no effort to offer their books abroad. Few have international business contacts, and even fewer bother to acquire translation rights from their authors, according to <a href=\" http://www.frankfurtbook-arabguest.net/peter%20ribkin(e).html\">Peter Ripken</a>, of the German Society for the Promotion of African, Asian and Latin American Literature. </p> <p>He says that when an Arabic book does come to the attention of a western publisher, it is usually as a result of it having been censored by Arab authorities or spotted by an enthusiastic translator. </p> <p>He also accuses western publishers of imposing their own ideas of what Arab creative writing should be about, selectively translating books that \"meet the readers' often prejudiced expectations of the orient\". </p> <p>Noting that books with the word \"veil\" in their title sell better than those with non-oriental sounding titles, he argues that the issue of women in Islamic societies is one of the \"clich\u00e9-ridden sales oriented themes\" of European publishers. </p> <p>One recent book playing on the stereotype of helpless Arab women in need of escape was Norma Khouri's Forbidden Love (entitled Honour Lost in the US). Erroneously billed as \"a harrowing true story\" of honour killing in Jordan, it was snapped up by a major publisher and sold 250,000 copies worldwide before being exposed as a hoax. </p> <p>While it may be true that certain writers, especially Arab feminists and political dissidents, have been appropriated by the west to suit western purposes, others deny there is any real bias: major literary works usually, somehow, get translated, although Arabic poetry (which is extremely difficult to translate) and stage plays may be exceptions. </p> <p>The US-based Project for the Translation of Arabic (PROTA), has sponsored a substantial number of translations which, it says, are chosen entirely on the basis of literary merit. </p> <p>In Cairo, the American University Press also makes a point of translating important books into English (including those of Naguib Mahfouz), and has around 70 titles currently in print. Some 50 books by Arab writers have also been translated into German to coincide with the Frankfurt Book Fair, which opens early next month and this year features the Arab world. </p> <p>The main problem, however, is that works of Arabic origin are not widely read in the west. Only a few authors manage sales of more than 10,000 in translation, but it is unclear whether this is because readers do not like them or simply do not know about them. </p> <p>Big publishers are reluctant to spend money promoting unfamiliar authors for what may prove to be a very small return, while smaller publishers lack the resources to promote them in any case. Critics also tend not to review Arab novels, perhaps because of their content, or because the techniques their writers use do not seem relevant to current literary discourse in the west. </p> <p>Readers, too, may be put off by books that don't immediately fit their expectations of a \"good\" novel. Arab novels can be profound, but some of their themes are specific to the Arab world. </p> <p>They also rely heavily on suggestion and understatement, where western novels tend to be explicit, especially on sexual matters. The works of Naguib Mahfouz and Abderrahman Munif are classics by any standard, but today's readers in the west would probably find them conventional and staid. All this can make modern Arab literature seem less interesting and exciting to a western reader. </p> <p>Translation removes books from their social and cultural context - and their intended readers - in the hope of bringing them to wider audience. Often, though, their initial impact is lost unless this wider audience knows the background of the country in which they were produced. Turki al-Hamad's banned novel, Adama, for example, is extremely radical and shocking in Saudi terms, but its content would raise few eyebrows in Europe or the US. </p> <p>Even so, there are a number of Arab writers whose work could be described as cutting edge. One is Hoda Barakat, a Lebanese novelist living in France, who continues to write in Arabic. </p> <p>Another is Rabih Alameddine, originally from Lebanon, who lives in the US and writes in English. His \"linear\" novel, Koolaids, which is technically fascinating, traces the parallel disasters of the Lebanese civil war and the Aids epidemic in San Francisco. Its characters die at an astonishing rate - sometimes several on a single page - but it is also very funny. In another of his books, I, the Divine, every chapter has the heading Chapter One. </p> <p>The Yacoubian Building, by Alaa al-Aswani, is also interesting and relevant beyond its original context - one of the characters has ambitions to become a policeman, but ends up as a terrorist - although many of its subtleties would only be appreciated by Egyptians or those who are very familiar with the country. </p> <p>Aswani's book made waves when first published in Egypt, and it has just been issued in English translation. </p> <p>There are good Arab books out there. Not very many, perhaps, but if the best could get the attention they deserve and reach a larger market, writers would surely be encouraged. Then it would be a matter of time before many more good books appeared.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life before</strong><br></p> <p>Jane and I have two very different responses to the merest hint of a chill in the air: Jane will turn to me and say, \"Stick the heating on, will you?\" and I'll sniffily retort, \"Can't you just put another layer on?\" Probably a bit mean, admittedly, given that she suffers from Raynaud's disease (a painful lack of blood supply to the hands and feet) but I do hate to see money going up in flames.</p> <p>Together, though, our responses sum up our heating strategy for the home - namely, that we don't really have one. The best I can offer is that we use a timer on our \"combi\" boiler during the winter. For example, on weekdays during cold spells, the central heating is timed to come on at 6.30am and go off at 9am once we've left for work. It then comes on again at about 5pm and shuts down for the night at 10.30pm. At weekends, depending on how cold it is, we override the timed setting and have it running on \"constant\". With a baby in the house we now tend to have the heating set slightly higher than normal, at about 23C. We're quite lazy, too, about monitoring which radiators are turned on, so we are invariably heating rooms that we're not using.</p> <p>But it's not all about the wanton waste of energy in our home. A few years ago we were tempted by some blurb sent to us by our electricity supplier to sign up for its \"green tariff\" - one of the attractions being that we would be sent some free energy-efficient light bulbs.</p> <p><strong> The ethical audit</strong><br></p> <p>The auditors: <strong> Hannah Berry</strong>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <strong> Mike Childs</strong>, campaign director of Friends of the Earth; <strong> Renee Elliot</strong>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>Mike's verdict after looking around is blunt. \"You really aren't doing enough to cut your energy consumption,\" he tells us. \"You should do a thorough survey of your energy use and take steps to reduce the amount of energy being wasted through poor insulation, such as your lack of double glazing. Double glazing can prevent 20% of heat loss through windows.\"</p> <p>Mike's not too impressed by our boiler either. \"Your central heating is gas-powered, which is not a bad thing, but the boiler looks old and could be far more efficient. If you're thinking of replacing it, then consider getting an energy-efficient condensing boiler, which could cut your fuel bills by more than 30%.\"</p> <p>Hannah asks us what energy providers we use. She is pleased to hear that we're signed up to a green tariff scheme but is less happy about our choice. \"London Energy's Green Tariff is a good start but other 'green' electricity schemes give greater support to the emerging renewable energy market. Just 0.09% of London Energy's generation is via renewables. And its parent company, EDF Energy, is part of the EDF Group, which is a big nuclear generator in France.\"</p> <p>Mike agrees that choosing the \"right\" green tariff by learning the subtle differences between them is important. \"Electricity companies are all obliged to supply some 'green' electricity, but many merely supply the legal minimum of renewable energy. Friends of the Earth has produced a league table of green electricity suppliers which rates companies according to how much renewable energy they provide. You should compare your options on our website [see right].\"</p> <p>They say there isn't really an equivalent renewable scheme for gas on the market, but Hannah suggests an alternative. \"Equigas [<a href=\"http://www.equigas.\">www.equigasco.uk</a>], tel: 0845 456 0170] is a good ethical option. It aims to avoid penalising low-income customers by charging 1.62p per kWh, regardless of how much you use or how you pay.\" (Since the audit took place, Scottish and Southern Energy has launched its power2 scheme, which offers a \"cleaner energy supply\" of both electricity and gas by using hydro-electricity generated in Scotland and by \"offsetting\" the carbon dioxide emissions of the gas through a tree-planting scheme. For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.thepower2.co.uk,\">www.thepower2.co.uk</a>, or call 08000 727702.)</p> <p>But talk isn't just about which firms provide our gas and electricity; it also includes ways to increase energy efficiency throughout our home.</p> <p>The first topic is whether our boiler should stay or go. I can't see the logic in ripping out a perfectly good combi boiler, even if it doesn't boast the latest fuel-efficient technology; we just can't justify the cost. Hannah reminds me of Mike's point that they can significantly lower running costs, but that doesn't convince me that it's worth taking immediate action. I agree, though, that when the boiler packs up we will certainly invest in a condensing boiler - one that uses a heat exchanger to use the exhaust gases that typically escape out of a flue to heat water.</p> <p>But don't forget there's another, better option, says Hannah. \"What about solar panels? Grants are available towards solar water heating, and up to 60% of the installation cost of photovoltaic roof panels for generating electricity can be reclaimed, too. Contact the Energy Saving Trust for more details about grants, or the Centre for Alternative Technology for equipment [see right].\"</p> <p>The auditors insist that there are dozens of simple things to do around the home that can make a big difference to energy efficiency. Renee says she draws inspiration from her frugal father: \"My dad seems to have spent my lifetime turning lights off in the house. Although it drove me nuts when I was a kid, I do find myself doing it now. Another simple step is cooking with the saucepan lid on and by steaming vegetables, which has the added bonus of being healthier than boiling them in water.\"</p> <p>Mike suggests a good idea would be to fill the holes between the floorboards in the sitting room. This can be done inexpensively with newspaper scraps, beading or sealant. \"Closing your curtains at dusk helps prevent heat escaping,\" he adds. \"Turning the thermostat down by just one degree can save energy - you may not even notice the difference in the temperature. And as your light bulbs go, make sure you get energy-efficient replacements. Lighting accounts for 10% to 15% of the average electricity bill.\"</p> <p>Hannah offers some of her own quick tips, too: \"Draught-strip external doors and window frames; pin up curtains that hang over radiators; turn down the thermostat to 17C; turn off radiators in unused rooms and place aluminium foil behind them.</p> <p>\"But don't forget the bigger picture that our homes are responsible for about a quarter of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore lobby for better investment in energy efficiency measures in our housing stock - Europe's worst insulated - and support campaigns that call for an end to our reliance on oil.\"</p> <p><strong> Life after</strong><br></p> <p>Our first task was to contact the local Energy Efficiency Advice Centre and complete its DIY home-energy check questionnaire. It was fairly straightforward: what type of residence we live in (mid-terrace Victorian house); how many bedrooms (three); what type of windows (wooden sash); how old the house is (1870s, we think); what boiler we have (combi), etc.</p> <p>A few of the questions left us a little stumped though, such as whether we had cavity walls or not. This was important, it transpired, as more heat is lost on average through the walls than anywhere else - about a third. A general pointer, we learned, is the age of the house. If it was built before 1930 then it probably will not have cavity walls, but another telltale sign is the brick pattern on the external walls.</p> <p>So Jane and I tramped outside to study the bricks. We were told to look for whether the wall was made up just from \"stretchers\" (the long side of a brick), suggesting it would be a cavity wall, or whether there were any \"headers\" showing (the thin end of a brick), which would indicate that it was probably a nine-inch solid brick wall. Given the age of the house, and that we immediately spotted headers in the pattern, we confirmed that there were no cavities in the walls. If there had been, we were told we could have spent about \u00a3300 having the cavities filled by injection which would have paid for itself in fuel bill savings within about three to five years. We had to console ourselves with the fact that, by living in a mid-terrace house, at least two of our walls are \"insulated\" by our neighbours.</p> <p>But I was pleasantly surprised to learn that we actually had loft insulation when I shone a torch around the loft space. It was a little bit patchy in places so I straightened it out the best I could, but in general it looked good and was the depth of the joists throughout. A slight concern though was that it was made of glass fibre, which I later learned can be a skin and respiratory irritant. A natural alternative, I discover, could be insulation made of sheep's wool, such as Thermafleece (<a href=\"http://www.secondnatureuk.com,\">www.secondnatureuk.com</a>, tel: 01768 486285).</p> <p>The questionnaire identified two main energy-waste villains in our home - the windows and our downstairs wooden floors. We both balked at the idea of replacing our sash windows with double glazing. It would destroy the look of the house and would cost a fortune. We were told about secondary glazing, but that seemed just as unsightly. We did find firms that fitted double-glazed, traditional-style sash windows, but the quotes were astronomical. Again, we settled on the rather unsatisfactory option of waiting until they needed replacing.</p> <p>The one area where we did decide to spend some cash was filling all the gaps in our wooden floors. The drafts are very noticeable in the winter so we paid for someone to come in and squeeze a mixture of wood dust and glue into the gaps. And after the boards were sanded smooth, the heat retention was immediately apparent. It actually led us to turn down the thermostat to about 19C.</p> <p>But this only made me start obsessing about the temperature of the house. I started to do that thing that seems to be the copyright of all middle-aged dads: backing up to a radiator, putting both hands flat on it, and, with teeth sucked, saying, \"This could do with a bleed\". To Jane's huge annoyance I turned down the hot water thermostat, too. But this little experiment lasted as long as it took Jane to scream from a tepid shower: \"Have you been fiddling with the bloody water heating?\"</p> <p>Finally, one major frustration to vent: why can't you get fully dimmable energy-efficient light bulbs? We went to the effort of changing all our light bulbs only to find that our new ones wouldn't work on our dimmer switches. We discovered that the Osram Dulux El Vario bulb (<a href=\"http://www.osram.co.uk,\">www.osram.co.uk</a>, tel: 01744 812221) was partly dimmable in that it has two brightness options, and even heard that such rarities were available in the US, but, sadly, we're still using a handful of conventional bulbs around the house.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more about Leo's experiment and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a>.

  "The balloons were cancelled but the Liberal Democrats still feel they have something to party about. <p>Charles Kennedy tempered the rhetoric - resisting the urge to anoint himself prime minister-in-waiting as his election chief Lord Razzall did earlier in the week - but only a little. He still told Lib Dem conference that theirs was a party on the brink of power, in tune with Britain's \"increasingly liberal instincts\".</p> <p>It's a bold claim. But the party is undoubtedly in a good position. It's on 22-26% in the polls, up from 18% at the last general election, and challenging Labour in next week's Hartlepool byelection with the Tories nowhere in sight.</p> <p>It still has problems, however. Two polls this week - one for the Times, the other for Newsnight - show that three-fifths of the electorate still think its policies don't add up.</p> <p>Conscious of this, the party employed a little rigour this week: identifying government cuts to pay for its spending proposals and whittling down its reams of policy documents to a handy 10-point plan.</p> <p>However, Lib Dem policy still doesn't entirely stand up. Plans to give joyriders a dose of \"tough liberalism\", for instance, were undermined by the revelation that that involves sending them go-karting. And one of the party's former senior advisers - academic and journalist Robert Taylor - describes its money-saving plans to abolish the Department of Trade and Industry as \"absurd\" and lacking in background work in today's Guardian.</p> <p>Perhaps that explained why Mr Kennedy didn't exactly sound convinced by his own policies during his speech. Party spokesman also have a \"rabbit in the headlights\" look about them when they're questioned about their plans.</p> <p>Traditionally this hasn't been a problem for the Lib Dems, with the two main parties choosing to ignore them at election time. Their current success means those days are over.</p> <p>Luckily for Mr Kennedy, the Tories' plans are hardly more convincing, while Michael Howard and his team remain deeply unpopular. The Lib Dem leader was right to accuse them of being \"out of touch with the Britain of today\". And, with the majority of Lib Dem target seats held by the Conservatives, Mr Kennedy is looking to challenge Mr Howard for the title of leader of the opposition next year. </p> <p>That's why the Lib Dems have used their conference to highlight policies likely to appeal to disillusioned Tory supporters - such as increasing police numbers - while downplaying off-putting ones. For instance, we heard little about the euro this week.</p> <p>But even if the Lib Dems do gain another 20 or 30 MPs at the next election, the temptation is to think \"so what?\" They'll have only taken them off the Tories, helping Labour retain its majority in the process. After all, it's hard not to suspect that Mr Kennedy's categorical rejection of any post-election coalition - he promised \"no deals\" today - is based on the assumption of a post-election Labour majority.</p> <p>This makes it hard to discern what his insistence on \"three-party politics\" actually amounts to. While he's played a valuable role in this parliament opposing the war in Iraq, it's hard to see what he'll do in the next. And that's after a whole hour of conference speech.</p>",
  "It's three party British politics. <p>That's been the real lesson of this year.</p> <p>Take those local elections.</p> <p>Big Liberal Democrat gains.</p> <p>Taking on and trouncing Labour in places like Cardiff and Cambridge, Liverpool and Newcastle;</p> <p>Making big gains from them in Leeds and Manchester as well.</p> <p>While in most of these places the Conservatives just simply disappeared.</p> <p>You know it is telling indeed that the voters did not think it worthwhile electing a single Conservative councillor in a place like Oxford.</p> <p>And if you take Scotland and Wales into account and they're scarcely a national UK political party any longer.</p> <p>And Liberal Democrats continued making gains from the Conservatives in places like Portsmouth, St Albans and Watford.</p> <p>In his first speech as the new Liberal Democrat Leader in Newcastle - after thirty years of one party Labour rule - this is what Peter Arnold had to say: -</p> <p>\"For Newcastle Liberal Democrats, one of the most important success criteria will be the extent to which we are able to give the city back to the people...We will be doing things differently, by making sure the Council is less politically partisan and more inclusive. We will be offering Opposition Groups the opportunity to adopt a more positive role in the council's affairs.\"</p> <p>Now there's the difference for you - in a nutshell.</p> <p>As that onetime Liberal, Winston Churchill, put it: \"In victory - magnanimity.\"</p> <p>That's the breath of fresh air that we bring to British politics - and to local communities with it.</p> <p>That's why we're on the move.</p> <p>And that's why we pushed Labour into third place for the first time ever in a national election.</p> <p>Add to those the European elections results.</p> <p>We stuck firmly to our reforming pro-European principles.</p> <p>And the outcome?</p> <p>Two more Liberal Democrat Members of the European Parliament. </p> <p>Fiona Hall in the North East.</p> <p>And Saj Karim in the North West.</p> <p>Saj - our first ever elected Liberal Democrat parliamentarian from an ethnic minority community.</p> <p>And about time too.</p> <p>But not unique for long.</p> <p>In Leicester South - just as in Brent East last year - we leapfrogged the Conservatives - we came from third place to take on Labour and win.</p> <p>Congratulations, Parmjit Gill.</p> <p>And never forget we came within an ace of doing the same in Birmingham Hodge Hill as well.</p> <p>Well done, Nicola Davies.</p> <p>So fantastic results. Each and every one.</p> <p>And when you leave Bournemouth make sure that your next stop is Hartlepool.</p> <p>That's where I'm heading next.</p> <p>Immediately after this speech.</p> <p>Lembit Opik is flying me there.</p> <p>I kid you not.</p> <p>Greater love hath no man for our party than his is prepared to place his life in Lembit's safe keeping in the skies above us.</p> <p>So I expect to see you all there in Hartlepool. Well, I really do hope to see you all there in Hartlepool!</p> <p>We are the challengers.</p> <p>The Conservatives have already conceded they aren't in the Hartlepool race. </p> <p>And it's a simple statement of fact that the Conservatives are now out of the race in most of urban Britain. </p> <p>And that the only effective challenge to Labour is coming from the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>People know we've done it before - and we can do it again in Hartlepool.</p> <p>If we go out there and make our case - make no mistake.</p> <p>We CAN do it. </p> <p>I want to talk to you today about the future.</p> <p>The future of two things.</p> <p>The future of our party.</p> <p>And also the future of our country.</p> <p>We want the two increasingly to go hand in hand.</p> <p>We know we can make the political weather - tuition fees, the council tax.</p> <p>And we know we're capable of much more yet.</p> <p>But our success also poses certain questions - and rightly so. </p> <p>Are these people up to it?</p> <p>Are those Liberal Democrats ready for the task in hand?</p> <p>Can we be sure we know what they stand for?</p> <p>Well we stand for three things above all else.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust. </p> <p>Those are our watchwords.</p> <p>Those are the core principles against which our policies must be measured. </p> <p>And they are the principles which match the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st century Britain.</p> <p>A Britain now of many faiths, many colours, many languages;<br> A variety of family structures; <br> Far greater life expectancy. <br> And working patterns our grandparents would scarcely recognise. <br>Social mobility and fast communications; High aspirations and far less deference; <br>Openness and tolerance about sexual orientation.</p> <p>A Britain where the individual counts for so much </p> <p>But still a Britain where a sense of community matters. </p> <p>In so many ways that's a liberal Britain.</p> <p>It's our task now to turn these instinctively liberal attitudes into positive votes for the party of British liberal democracy.</p> <p>And it is also a Britain in which the way we are governed is being transformed. </p> <p>We have a Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales, both elected by fairer votes - involving proportional representation.</p> <p>And -on November 4th people in the North East will have a referendum for a regional assembly. We're out campaigning hard for that - and I'll be back on that campaign trail again shortly.</p> <p>Devolution is at its best when it gets things done. And it's getting things done that show people what we value and what we stand for.</p> <p>It's been a big responsibility for us, in Wales, where we helped bring much needed stability to the Assembly at a crucial moment - and better policies as a result.</p> <p>Reduced class sizes; more environmental initiatives; free school milk; Free admission to art galleries and museums, recognising that the legacy and the vitality of Celtic culture demands the decision-makers to understand not just the price of things but also the value of things.</p> <p>As a result - people know more about what we stand for. And they're voting accordingly.</p> <p>Impressive gains this year in Cardiff, Bridgend and Swansea - and so many other places across the country.</p> <p>And in Wales we carry on pushing for an extension to the law making powers of the Assembly - that has to be the next logical and necessary step forward.</p> <p>And in Scotland where the partnership there has been delivering on many of our top priorities;</p> <p>Free personal care for the elderly - delivered.</p> <p>Abolishing tuition fees - delivered.</p> <p>Fair votes for local government elections - being delivered. </p> <p>But it doesn't stop there.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland have set the new agenda for devolution. </p> <p>A Scottish agenda that deals with long-term challenges - like poor health; the environment; the need to improve education, the foundation for an enterprising country.</p> <p>New legislation announced by Jim Wallace just this month to provide free eye and dental checks for all.</p> <p>And a new Environment Bill announced by Ross Finnie so that a green thread runs through the heart of Scottish government, one where every policy will be audited for its environmental impact.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats getting things done. </p> <p>And demonstrating how our approach - every time - is rooted in freedom, fairness and trust. </p> <p>I've done a lot of travelling across Britain this year.</p> <p>And with it a lot of listening.</p> <p>I listened to the students on campus in Plymouth, worried about their steadily deepening debts and how on earth they would ever escape them.</p> <p>I listened to the young mother in a Leicester shop, troubled that teachers are not getting the time to teach her children properly.</p> <p>I listened to the Asian grandmother in Huddersfield, who told me about being genuinely afraid, for the first time in over thirty years in her local community, because of the growth of mindless racism among an unrepresentative few.</p> <p>And then the high street traders in Birmingham, utterly sick and tired of senseless vandalism against their properties.</p> <p>And their local customers, equally scared about street violence and the threat of crime as it affects them personally.</p> <p>The pensioners in Exeter - bitter about their dwindling resources, confused about losing their pension books, unhappy about the level of pensions themselves and angry about seemingly never-ending council tax rises.</p> <p>And to the doctor in Norwich, expressing his sheer frustration at the remote, command and control from London which characterises so much of this government's mismanagement of our National Health Service.</p> <p>And then the school pupils in Cardiff, thinking aloud about pollution and climate change - uncertain about the environment they would inherit.</p> <p>This is our Britain today; these are typical of people's concerns.</p> <p>Well, if you seek to lead, first you must listen.</p> <p>People have a huge desire to be listened to; for politicians to take the time to understand their problems.</p> <p>And address those problems with solutions.</p> <p>It is we Liberal Democrats that are now providing the answers.</p> <p>For students - when the pupil aspires to become the student, we would encourage and enable them - by stopping tuition fees and axing top-up fees - one of the most socially retrograde acts of this government, when what Britain needs is a university system affordable to all.</p> <p>For parents - we will equip children for life - because children well cared for and well taught in their early years have a far better chance of success.</p> <p>So we will reduce class sizes for the youngest children and give teachers time to teach and children time to learn by abolishing unnecessary tests and red tape.</p> <p>And we would ensure that every child, in every classroom, in every school is taught by a qualified teacher in the relevant subject.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For those in fear of racism - first, a real lead from politicians - celebrating the fact that our country is better, it's richer and more diverse, precisely because it is a multicultural society.</p> <p>And that we have been prepared to stand out and if necessary alone in having no truck with short-term, knee-jerk responses to complex social issues.</p> <p>That we won't pander to the lowest common denominator over asylum and immigration. But we'll reform the systems - to make them fairer and faster.</p> <p>And that we respect people's genuine religious and cultural identities at community level. </p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On Crime - 10,000 more police on the streets and cutting the time spent on paperwork, so they can spend more time tackling drug dealers, muggers and yobs.</p> <p>Use prison as an opportunity to educate in the basics - numeracy, literacy - so that when they get out people will be far better able to find work and far less likely to reoffend.</p> <p>And for the victims of crime open up the courts so that they can confront the offenders - and speed up the system of compensation as well.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For pensioners - we will continue - to make and win the case for axing the unjust, unfair, increasingly unworkable council tax.</p> <p>And its replacement by a fair, local income tax - based on people's ability to pay.</p> <p>We'll stop the scandal of elderly people having to pay for their personal care - and probably losing the family home in the process. We would deliver free long-term care for the elderly.</p> <p>And all pensioners over 75 - the war generation - should be entitled to a pension which lifts them above mean-testing - \u00a3100 extra a month. No-one should be demeaned in their old age anymore.</p> <p>And this specific pledge to women, who have long been discriminated against because of the way the pension system works. </p> <p>For the first time you will be treated equally.</p> <p>For the first time you will have a pension in your own right.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On health - We would put patients first and free doctors and nurses from Whitehall meddling. Liberal Democrats would hack away the red tape, abolish the absurd targets and free our frustrated doctors and nurses. </p> <p>Let the local community and the local doctors and local nurses make the decisions. They are far better placed to get them right. </p> <p>And more emphasis than ever before should be placed on prevention of ill health and promotion of healthy lifestyles. We truly need a health and not just a sickness service.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On the environment - our determination to make the environment count at every level of Government means thinking green in every area.</p> <p>Yes, it's big picture stuff - from the food chain to climate change, energy to trade, aviation to sustainable international development.</p> <p>Britain can't do this alone. The Prime Minister is right to use our presidency of the EU and the G8 next year to press for consensus.</p> <p>But if we can lead by example, if we can achieve our Kyoto targets ahead of time, we can encourage other countries to sign up.</p> <p>If we can deliver 20% of our electricity needs through renewable energy by 2020, that would be leading by example.</p> <p>Take air travel - which is fast become the world's biggest polluter.</p> <p>We should be shifting taxes on aviation away from the passenger and onto the plane itself which does the polluting.</p> <p>Now that would be leading by example too, encouraging better fuel efficiency and therefore less pollution.</p> <p>But quality of life actually begins at home - it's in your street, around your community.</p> <p>And our approach to the environment must begin there too.</p> <p>The green thread that should run through all aspects of government, should run through all aspects of our lives also.</p> <p>So more park and ride schemes for our towns and cities - cutting pollution in our streets.</p> <p>More local recycling initiatives - showing how all of us can make that difference within our own homes.</p> <p>Cutting waste - reusing - improving.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>Because that's what these - and many more - policies are rooted in.</p> <p>Policies designed to create more freedom.</p> <p>Based on social fairness.</p> <p>Not bogus, false choices - designed to distract.</p> <p>But real, quality local choice - designed to deliver.</p> <p>And it's all underpinned by economic fairness as well.</p> <p>This is crucial to our credibility and critical to our success.</p> <p>From the outset, I have insisted that we have the most watertight set of tax and expenditure proposals possible. </p> <p>We want to tax more fairly and spend more wisely.</p> <p>Isn't it a disgrace that after 7 years of a supposedly Labour government the poorest 20% contribute more of their income in tax than do the richest 20%?</p> <p>We don't want the politics of economic envy. But we do want the politics of social equity.</p> <p>What does that mean?</p> <p>It means asking the top 1% of income earners to pay a top marginal rate of tax of 50p for every pound earned above \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>That pays for our immediate commitments to: </p> <p>* Scrap tuition and top-up fees for students;</p> <p>* Introduce free personal care for elderly and disabled people;</p> <p>* And keep down the level of local taxes.</p> <p>But spending on our priorities does not mean higher taxes across the board. It means looking hard as well at how much Government spends and getting value for money for taxpayers.</p> <p>And we've already found further large savings - at least \u00a35bn a year - by cutting back on big, centralised government and redirecting money to priority spending:</p> <p>\u00b7 Dropping plans for identity cards;</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrapping some government departments and relocating others away from high-cost central London;</p> <p>\u00b7 Doing less, better and more efficiently - and concentrating more on what really matters.</p> <p>It is this approach which gives us the credibility to pledge.</p> <p>\u00b7 Axing the \u00a31bn Child Trust Fund, the so called baby bonds scheme, and spending the money now when children need it most, not the state stashing it away until 2022;</p> <p>\u00b7 10,000 more police on the streets - cutting crime and the fear of crime;</p> <p>\u00b7 Making sure that by 2011 Britain finally fulfils its UN obligations by boosting the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of GNP;</p> <p>\u00b7 \u00a325 more on pensions every week for those aged 75 and over with a million pensioners taken off means testing.</p> <p>The figures add up; the balance sheet is balanced. </p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>It is trust that has to underpin everything else.</p> <p>And it's winning public trust that is going to be the biggest challenge of all.</p> <p>Over the course of this parliament one issue more than any other has helped define just what the Liberal Democrats stand for in the minds of millions of our fellow citizens.</p> <p>You know what I'm talking about.</p> <p>And the people know exactly what we've been talking about.</p> <p>From the outset we have provided rational, principled and consistent opposition to the war in Iraq.</p> <p>We've done it without exaggeration. We've done it without name-calling. We've done it - quite simply - because we believed it was the right thing to do.</p> <p>Now I believe the vast majority of people have made their minds up - one way or the other.</p> <p>Donald Rumsfeld promised shock and awe.</p> <p>What we got was shock and then steadily increasing horror. </p> <p>The Prime Minister promised action on the Middle East Road Map.</p> <p>What we got was little progress and more violence.</p> <p>There's a sullen, and increasingly angry mood on the issue. And understandably so.</p> <p>Not least when Kofi Annan declares the war illegal.</p> <p>When the Iraq Survey Group is expected to conclude that the WMD were not there.</p> <p>When the Foreign Office warned of the likely disastrous consequences.</p> <p>And when it appears the Government told the Bush administration, a full year before the war started, that it would not budge in its support for their policy of regime change - and yet the Prime Minister told our Parliament and our people that it was all about weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>There is a fundamental question that the Prime Minister has consistently failed to answer.</p> <p>I asked him this in the House of Commons in the run up to war, and again as recently as the 20th of July this year during the debate on the Butler Report.</p> <p>\"Did he advise President Bush privately - long before the United Nations route was formally abandoned - that if the President decided to prosecute an invasion of Iraq, the British would be in active military support, come what may?</p> <p>\"If he did advise the President to that effect, when did such an exchange take place?\"</p> <p>When Parliament next convenes, the Prime Minister must take the first opportunity to come to the Despatch Box and make a full statement. </p> <p>It's time we got an answer. </p> <p>And if the Prime Minister still refuses, the people can make a judgement.</p> <p>There is the ultimate verdict of the general election itself.</p> <p>Lord Hutton did not provide the answer.</p> <p>Nor did Lord Butler.</p> <p>The decision to decline to participate in Lord Butler's enquiry was a tough one at the time.</p> <p>But it was the correct decision as events have proved.</p> <p>And at the end of the day that is what trust in political leadership has to be all about.</p> <p>What trust today in what our leaders told us at the time about Iraq?</p> <p>And what kind of corrosive effect does that have on politics generally?</p> <p>Yet the tragic experience of Iraq should have the opposite effect.</p> <p>And I believe it can.</p> <p>It should galvanise people to participate, to make their views known through the ballot box.</p> <p>It should strengthen all of our resolves to rededicate ourselves to the rebuilding of effective international institutions, to the repairing of shattered alliances among long-standing friends.</p> <p>But within our own country - one lesson must be learned.</p> <p>This country is still crying out for an effective political system that responds to them and listens to the people.</p> <p>More openness. More accountability. Politicians taking responsibility for their decisions.</p> <p>Never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence.</p> <p>Never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the United Nations.</p> <p>Never again must Britain find itself on such a basis so distanced from principal partners within Europe.</p> <p>Never again should our troops find themselves without proper and adequate equipment in a war zone.</p> <p>Never again should such supreme Prime Ministerial power be allowed to progress without sufficient checks and balances.</p> <p>And without the proper operation of collective Cabinet government itself.</p> <p>And never again should a so-called \"official opposition\" be entitled to that name when it so pathetically fails to fulfil its most basic parliamentary function and duty - the provision of constructive and effective questioning of the executive of the day.</p> <p>Never again.</p> <p>But we should not just look back in anger.</p> <p>There is every sign that we need to look forward with increasing anxiety.</p> <p>And that is why the Prime Minister should also take that opportunity to give a cast iron guarantee that the United Kingdom will not support unilateral military action against Iran.</p> <p>You know some commentators will tell you that our recent victories are just the fall out from Iraq.</p> <p>That the Lib Dems are just the protest vote.</p> <p>Well, let's face it. There has been a lot for people to protest about.</p> <p>But we are being seen more and more as a party which does win elections, which does exercise responsible representation, which has become increasingly comfortable with the duties and the disciplines of power.</p> <p>Some also say that you can't go chasing left-wing voters and right-wing voters at one and the same time - while remaining consistent and true to your principles.</p> <p>It is a deeply flawed analysis - based on a fundamental misreading of today's Britain.</p> <p>Why? Because for the vast majority of people who live their lives in an increasingly inter-dependent world, facing increasingly complex issues, for them the old-fashioned nostrums of right and left no longer apply.</p> <p>They're looking for solution-based politics. Politics which address their everyday needs.</p> <p>There is a shift in the way people view politics, one that transcends any single issue.</p> <p>Iraq has been part of this, but by no means is it the whole story.</p> <p>I come across it, day in and day out.</p> <p>People see that the Labour and Conservative agendas are converging.</p> <p>Where as ours is about having the freedom to make the most of our lives.</p> <p>It's about what is fair - taxation based on ability to pay and delivery for all not the few.</p> <p>And that you have to be able to trust your political leaders and your political parties to deliver.</p> <p>There's a deep-rooted sense in our country that somehow all is not quite right.</p> <p>That somehow all is not as we're being told it is. An underlying sense of doubt.</p> <p>Made worse by the fact that people just don't trust this Government.</p> <p>This Government flags up the big, long-term difficult issues - pension provision, funding local services, global warming - but then puts off serious discussion and decisions until safely beyond another general election.</p> <p>But people don't identify with the Conservatives - because that party just doesn't connect with them.</p> <p>They hark back to a Britain that is no more. They're out of touch with the Britain of today.</p> <p>No wonder they fall back on hard-core instincts - and increasingly belongs to all our yesterdays. </p> <p>In huge swathes of the country it's the Conservatives who are now firmly established - as the third party.</p> <p>In so much of the country a vote for the Conservatives is now a wasted vote.</p> <p>The third party - on their third leader in as many years - and a third leader who's just had his third reshuffle in less than a year.</p> <p>Well, they say variety is the spice of life.</p> <p>For the Conservatives it looks to me much more like the kiss of death.</p> <p>They belong to the past. </p> <p>We're working for the future.</p> <p>We are moving from a party of protest to a party of power.</p> <p>3 party politics is here - and here to stay.</p> <p>You know, at times this past year I've felt rather nostalgic.</p> <p>21 years as a Member of Parliament.</p> <p>You learn quite a lot after more than two decades doing any job.</p> <p>Direct personal experience does teach along the way.</p> <p>That's why, whenever I'm asked to speculate - an occupational hazard - I always suggest to people not to waste time on the crystal ball, but instead learn from the history book. </p> <p>It's really quite simple.</p> <p>For the country to believe in a political party - first that party has to believe in itself. </p> <p>We're at our best, we perform best, we persuade best - when we spend our time talking positively about what it is that we have to offer.</p> <p>And we're far more likely to achieve that from a position of principled party independence - not one distracted by noises off.</p> <p>So when people ask me \"Where does your party stand?\" my starting point is not the crystal ball.</p> <p>Instead, it's crystal clear.</p> <p>No nods, no winks, no deals, no stitch ups.</p> <p>If, on polling day at next general election, more people vote Liberal Democrat - then the next day and in the next parliament what you will get are more Liberal Democrats working for more liberal democracy.</p> <p>Not something else.</p> <p>But working all out for better public policies from parliament.</p> <p>Prepared to work with others on issues of principle - like Europe.</p> <p>But not prepared to surrender our essential political independence along the way.</p> <p>That's our Liberal Democrat pledge to the people. </p> <p> So there is a fundamental choice before us all at the next General Election.</p> <p>The British people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>225 days.</p> <p>Then a stark choice. A serious choice.</p> <p>And we, increasingly, are the winning choice.</p> <p>Because all that we say and all that we do is based on those fundamentals.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust</p> <p>That's us.</p> <p>That's what we want from our politics.</p> <p>That's what we stand for.</p> <p>That's what we want our country to stand for.</p> <p>At home - and abroad.</p> <p>That's Liberal Democracy.</p>",

  "<p>Creating a blog to track the progress of your PhD thesis might seem like the ultimate delaying tactic - a way to avoid ever actually writing the thing itself. But for Esther MacCallum-Stewart, currently doing a D.Phil thesis on popular culture during the first world war at the University of Sussex, the opposite has been true. She began blogging about her thesis (<a href=\"http://www.whatalovelywar.co.uk/war/\">www.whatalovelywar.co.uk/war/</a>) in February 2002, initially to keep track of the ideas she was developing. \"I realised I was making notes all over the place, and they weren't making any sense at all.\"</p> <p>The blog has helped her focus her research more effectively, she says. Its search functions let her find ideas quickly, while its public nature means she can work on her research wherever she is. And the blog's format makes it easy to link to and track the massive amount of first world war-related material online. Over time, the site has also brought her to the attention of other academics, non-specialists and the media. Though it may go quiet as her thesis deadline looms early next year, MacCallum-Stewart is planning to keep the blog going. It's become an indispensable part of her academic working life, she says.</p> <p>She is not alone. Some of the blogosphere's biggest names work in academia - Glenn \"Instapundit\" Reynolds, one of the web's most popular bloggers, is a law professor at the University of Tennessee. Even so, when MacCallum-Stewart started, she was something of a pioneer, at least on this side of the Atlantic. Now many others working in academia are using blogs to develop and share ideas, both with academic peers and general readers.</p> <p>It's no surprise that academics specialising in the net should blog. It's equally unsurprising that researchers pushing boundaries in very technical fields are unlikely to share cutting-edge discoveries on a blog. But most academics fall between these two poles and increasing numbers are using the technology. Crooked Timber (<a href=\"http://www.crookedtimber.org\">www.crookedtimber.org</a>), an academic group blog, features a long list of links to academic sites, taking in everything from law, classics and philosophy to history and anthropology.</p> <p>Most blogs are individual efforts, but earlier this year, the University of Minnesota Libraries announced UThink (<a href=\"http://blog.lib.umn.edu/\">http://blog.lib.umn.edu/</a>), an initiative intended to make it easy for faculty, staff and students to use blogs, either for educational or personal purposes. The university has also made blogs an object of academic study. The rhetoric department has just published Into the Blogosphere (<a href=\"http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/\">http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/</a>), an essay collection about blogging that covers weblog journalism, the gender/ethnic biases of the blogosphere and much more.</p> <p>Academic researchers are drawn to blogs because they're useful knowledge management tools. MacCallum-Stewart says that her site quickly became a kind of \"mind gym\", a place to test out and develop ideas and to hone her prose style. The social networking side of blogging became very important here, she says. Her blog helped her build links and share ideas with researchers in the area at other universities.</p> <p>More interestingly, her blog has drawn in non-academic readers. Writing every day for them - making sure her arguments on current popular myths about the first world war are clear and concise - has helped her prose style, she says. \"I think I write in a more accessible, less academic way now,\" she says. The sense of connecting with a larger public is important, she adds. \"You get so obsessed with a thesis. It's just you most of the time, so to be able to talk about it to all sorts of people is very useful.\"</p> <p>Over the past decade, academics have used mailing lists, discussion boards and learning journals, but these have usually existed behind university firewalls. In contrast, blogging can invite the rest of the world into the common room - and some believe that can only be a good thing.</p> <p>\"It was important to me that my research be publicly accessible,\" says Anne Galloway (<a href=\"http://www.purselipsquarejaw.org\">www.purselipsquarejaw.org</a>), who is doing a PhD on the effects of ubiquitous computing on space and culture at Carleton University, in Canada. \"My work is supported by government scholarships. I wanted to see how weblogs could be used to encourage greater academic accountability to the public - and greater public interaction with academic research.\"</p> <p>But many more traditional academics are suspicious of taking their ideas public in this way. For some, the blogging academic is the latest incarnation of the media don, ready to simplify complex ideas in return for a few minutes of fame. Others are wary of sharing ideas before they are ready - or of seeing original theories stolen before they are published.</p> <p>\"People do worry about copyright,\" says MacCallum-Stewart. \"I've found some of my stuff on other people's sites occasionally. They get stern emails and usually take it down.\" She points out that blogs date things, so putting ideas up can be like putting down a marker, making sure the world knows you came up with a particular idea first.</p> <p>University tutors are also experimenting with blogs as teaching tools, using them to disseminate links and information to classes, sometimes as places where students can collaborate on group projects. A specialist in social and political philosophy at the University of Bristol and a long-term blogger, Crooked Timber's Chris Bertram used a blog last year to supplement a course on Rousseau's Social Contract (<a href=\"http://rousseau.typepad.com/\">http://rousseau.typepad.com/</a>). \"The blog became more like a course noticeboard,\" he says. \"I think the students found it a little unfamiliar.\" As a result, he only got one student comment during the course. However, he is continuing the experiment this year, planning to integrate the blog more fully into the course in a bid to get the students \"more interactively engaged\".</p> <p>\"Using a blog to get information to the class is useful,\" says Jill Walker (<a href=\"http://huminf.uib.no/~jill/\">http://huminf.uib.no/~jill/</a>), who teaches at the Department of Humanistic Informatics at the University of Bergen, in Norway. \"But it's more important to teach students network literacy.\" So students on her web design and web aesthetics course blog for a term and pick out selected posts to be graded as part of the course assessment. Walker's students aren't just learning about online style or web design, she says. They're learning to work on and with a network. \"If a student links to something another blogger has written, that blogger is likely to link back to the student's work, and hey presto, the student is part of a larger debate that extends far beyond the classroom.\"</p> <p>In the same vein, Charles Tryon (<a href=\"http://chutry.wordherders.net\">http://chutry.wordherders.net</a>) gets students to blog for a first year composition course he teaches at the school of literature, communication and culture at Georgia Tech in America. Last year, they kept personal blogs. This year, they are working on group blogs while Tryon coordinates the class via a blog (<a href=\"http://democracymatters.blogspot.com\">http://democracymatters.blogspot.com</a>), which points students to relevant material online. He suggests that blogging - reading and writing posts, following links and discussions - encourages students to think critically about technology and how it affects the way we write and think.</p> <p>Tryon adds that \"blogs are no substitute for class discussion\". Some suggest that eventually, blogs will become just one part of the general digital tool kit available to teachers. Others suspect they may have more lasting effects on academia.</p> <p>Steven Shaviro (<a href=\"http://www.shaviro.com/Blog\">www.shaviro.com/Blog</a>), professor of English at Wayne State University, Detroit, says blogs could supplement the peer review system. \"Academic writing and publishing depends on peer review. It serves as a filter to weed out slipshod work. But it is also constraining - the norms enforced by peer review, by dissertation advisers, journal editors and so forth, often have a built-in bias against new, experimental work. So I can see blogs as an alternative space for research, not replacing peer review but existing alongside it.\"</p> <p>For Walker, blogs make academics more accountable for their theories. \"If I write something about people, academically, and publish it online, they'll find it and talk back in their blogs. I have to deal with that. I can't stay safely in my ivory tower. And frankly, I don't want to.\"</p> <p>Others are less happy about the idea. Crooked Timber's Bertram warns of a growing tendency for universities to seek to impose \"more corporate control over what academics do. The weblog format is open and public - I think that's a very good thing. But some universities now want to adopt forms of proprietary courseware that actually lock out people from outside the university.\"</p> <p>He mentions recent events at the University of Birmingham, which stopped hosting personal websites and blogs maintained by academic staff, following controversy over links to allegedly anti-semitic content. New guidelines introduced by the university say staff sites must now be relevant to their academic or administrative work.</p> <p>\"As more academics become comfortable with this technology, I expect we'll see lots of confrontations between academics who want to use blogs and adminstrators who want to exercise more control,\" Bertram says. \"It's difficult to predict what will happen. But it would be a pity if things become more restrictive than they are now.\"</p>",
  "Former Mexican pop phenomenon Gloria Trevi has been released from prison after nearly five years, cleared of kidnapping, corruption of minors, and complicity to rape charges. <p>The case has absorbed Mexico since it broke in 1998. The verdict, read out in a jail courthouse with Trevi listening behind a white wire mesh cage fondling a rosary, was broadcast live on national television.</p> <p>Trevi, now 36, who earned the moniker \"Mexico's Madonna\" - left the jail in the northern Mexican city of Chihuahua on Tuesday night to the cheers of a small group of fans gathered outside.</p> <p>She promised a new album soon of songs composed in jail.</p> <p>\"After four years, eight months and eight days in prison, justice has been done,\" Trevi told Mexican news anchorman Joaqu\u00edn Lopez Doriga just before leaving jail.</p> <p>Impeccably groomed and clearly delighted, the one-time symbol of irreverence mentioned God in almost every utterence.</p> <p>Trevi said she had \"no time or space in my heart,\" for bitterness.</p> <p>\"I can't believe it. In the morning and throughout the day, I felt like I was in an old western movie, like my head was in the noose and I was waiting for a cowboy to arrive to save me,\" she told reporters.</p> <p>Fans who greeted her also hurled insults at their idol's main accuser, the 21-year-old former backing singer Karina Yapor, who joined Trevi's roving musical troupe as a star-struck 12-year-old.</p> <p>\"This is an international embarrassment,\" she said as she left the court. \"A failure of justice.\"</p> <p>Ms Yapor claims the then pop diva lured her and other young girls into the group promising musical training. She says Trevi actually turned them into sexual slaves of her manager and former lover, Sergio Andrade.</p> <p>Judge Javier Pineda ruled that there was not enough evidence to support the charges against Trevi and two other backing singers also accused of complicity. The case against Mr Andrade continues.</p> <p>Mr Andrade discovered the 16-year-old Gloria de los Angeles Trevino Ruiz in 1985 and put her in a girl band he managed called Boquitas Pintadas.</p> <p>The renamed Gloria Trevi went solo in 1989. Her raspy-voiced teen anthems caught on and the Trevi phenomenon was launched. The singer's first three records sold over five million copies and prompted armies of wannabee teenage girls to imitate her rebellious style.</p> <p>Then in 1998 a former backing singer and ex wife of Mr Andrade, Aline Hernandez, published a book detailing abuses and humiliation she claimed characterized the cult-like troupe.</p> <p>Her lengthy brush with the law began later that year after a baby abandoned in a convent in Spain turned out to be the child of her backing singer, Karina Yapor. At the time, the teenage Ms Yapor was thought to be under the charge of Trevi and Mr Andrade whose whereabouts were unknown.</p> <p>Ms Yapor's mother filed the first legal suit in her home city of Chihuahua, which began after her daughter's reappearance a few months later, and eventually turned into the current case.</p> <p>In the meantime, the scandal was further fuelled by other members of the group and former proteges of Mr Andrade, who told similar stories of abuse. Several have young children they say were fathered by him.</p> <p>An international manhunt finally located the singer and her manager in Rio de Janiero. They were arrested in January 2000, along with yet another backing singer, Mar\u00eda Raquenel Portillo.</p> <p>Even with the accused behind bars, the plot twists continued. In mid-2001, Trevi announced she was pregnant despite being in an all-female wing of a jail.</p> <p>After first refusing to name the father, the singer said she was raped by a prison guard. DNA tests produced by the Brazilian authorities indicated Mr Andrade fathered the child, although Trevi's defence claimed the results were doctored.</p> <p>Trevi's son, Angel Gabriel, was born in prison nine months before she returned voluntarily to Mexico in December 2002.</p> <p>Ms Portillo followed a few months later. Mr Andrade was extradited in November last year.</p> <p>The group has claimed the charges were fabricated by a Mexico TV network, in retaliation for Trevi's decision to sign a contract with a rival broadcaster.</p>",
  "American officials diverted a transatlantic flight 600 miles in the belief that the presence of Yusuf Islam, the charity worker and pop star formerly known as Cat Stevens, posed an imminent threat to national security, it emerged yesterday. <p>The 56-year-old was escorted off the plane by FBI agents after customs officers realised that his name was on a \"watchlist\". He was due to be deported to the UK last night after questioning. His daughter, 21, was allowed into the US.</p> <p>Mr Islam, who is best known for hits such as Morning Has Broken, Wild World and Peace Train, last visited the United States in May. His name was added to the list subsequently and a US government source said he was refused entry because of fears that he had financially supported Hamas.</p> <p>\"He was placed on the list because of concerns about activities that could potentially be related to terrorism,\" said a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. It is not clear why officials chose to divert the flight - at substantial cost and delaying other passengers for six hours - rather than detain Mr Islam on his arrival in Washington.</p> <p>Muslim leaders on both sides of the Atlantic condemned the US decision, with the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) describing it as \"a slap in the face of sanity\".</p> <p>Mr Islam was denied access to Israel four years ago after claims he had donated money to Hamas, but said he had \"never knowingly supported any terrorist groups.\" He sold 50m albums before renouncing music for charity and educational work after converting to Islam.</p> <p>He founded Muslim schools in London and as head of the Islamia Schools Trust has met the prime minister and the Prince of Wales. He donated profits from recent album sales to the September 11 bereaved, saying that no \"right-thinking\" Muslim could condone the attacks.</p> <p>The Transportation Security Agency (TSA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, is authorised by law to maintain a list of people suspected of posing \"a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to airline or passenger safety\".</p> <p>But US civil liberties groups have warned that criteria for placing people on the list are hazy. Dozens have complained of being included unfairly.</p> <p>United Airlines flight 919 from London to Washington was diverted to Bangor, Maine, after customs officers told the TSA Mr Islam was on board.</p> <p>Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the denial of entry to internationally-respected Islamic figures \"sends the disturbing message that even moderate and mainstream Muslims will now be treated like terrorists\".</p>",
  "<p>Girls at secondary school are twice as likely as boys to become regular smokers and may be using cigarettes as an appetite suppressant to keep their weight down, according to research today from Leeds University. </p> <p>It found no difference between girls and boys at 11-12 when 2% of both groups admitted smoking regularly. </p> <p>But by the age of 13-14, 16% of girls and 8% of boys had taken up the habit. And in the run-up to GCSEs at 15-16, 31% of girls and 16% of boys said they were smoking regularly. </p> <p>The findings came from a six-year investigation by the university's school of psychology for the Economic and Social Research Council. </p> <p>They emerged as John Reid, the health secretary, struggles to establish a consensus in the cabinet on whether or not to include a ban on smoking in public places in an autumn white paper. </p> <p>Mark Connor, leader of the Leeds programme, said girls were no more likely than boys to take up smoking as a result of peer pressure. </p> <p>\"One suggestion is that it has something to do with teenage girls using tobacco as an appetite control mechanism. They are particularly using cigarettes to keep their weight down. </p> <p>\"But that is speculation and we are hoping to go back again and talk to those who have smoked about their influences,\" he said. </p> <p>Girls' greater propensity to smoke had been indicated in government reports in 2000 and 2001, but the Leeds study is the first to show such a wide gender gap. It was conducted through regular interviews with more than 1,000 young people, using saliva and breath tests to check the validity of the answers. </p> <p>It followed a report by the Office for National Statistics in March showing an increase in binge drinking among young women aged 16-24. Between 1998 and 2002 the proportion of young women binge drinkers increased from 24% to 28%, while the proportion among young men fell from 39% to 35%. </p> <p>The study found that health education lessons warning of the dangers of smoking did not have a lasting effect. Children given these lessons in the early years of secondary school were less likely to smoke at 13-14, but when the researchers returned two years later the benefit was lost. </p> <p>They said this emphasised the need to have repeated health education at regular intervals if it was to have any long-term effect. </p> <p>Dr Conner said the researchers were concerned about the increase in the number of teenage smokers they found in their study. </p> <p>\"From the results of our study, the pointers to someone in the first year of secondary school taking up smoking by the age of 15-16 are being a girl and having smoked when they were younger. </p> <p>\"For those who were non-smokers at age 13-14, pupils most likely to take up the habit by the age of 15-16 were those with a more positive attitude towards smoking, who lived with smokers, had more friends who smoked than didn't - and again, being a girl.\" </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"We have a comprehensive programme in place to tackle smoking, which focuses on action to discourage young people from starting, and help for all smokers, of whatever age, to quit. </p> <p>\"The ban on advertising tobacco is aimed primarily at removing the attraction of glossy advertisements which entice young people to try the product _ Over time we expect that the result will be a drop in take-up.\" </p>",
  "Yusuf Islam, the charity worker and pop singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, today arrived back in the UK saying he felt \"victimised\" by being barred from entering the US. <p>His return followed a complaint by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, to the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, over his treatment. Mr Straw, in New York for the UN general assembly meeting, told Mr Powell \"this action should not have been taken\" over the former singer, who was known as Cat Stevens until 1977. </p> <p>The Foreign Office, however, declined to confirm whether \"this action\" referred to Mr Islam's detention or his inclusion on a US security watch list. Yesterday, the Foreign Office had refused to become involved in the case, saying \"the reasons for his detention and return are obviously a matter for the US, and not for us\".</p> <p>Mr Islam flew to Heathrow airport after being escorted from a London to Washington flight on Tuesday and interrogated by the FBI. His United Airlines flight was diverted 600 miles to Bangor, Maine after the US Transportation Security Agency was told that he was on board.</p> <p>US officials said Mr Islam was on the watch list because of suspicions he was associated with potential terrorists. He was barred from entering Israel in 2000 following claims he had donated money to Hamas - a claim he denied - and last visited the US in May. </p> <p>\"I'm totally shocked,\" Mr Islam told reporters at Heathrow. \"Everybody knows who I am. I am no secret figure. Everybody knows my campaigning for charity, for peace. There's got to be a whole lot of explanation.\"</p> <p>The 56-year-old said he would be consulting his lawyers over the possibility of suing the US authorities for defamation. </p> <p>\"People make mistakes,\" he said. \"I just hope they made a big mistake. We'll see ... half of me wants to smile and half of me wants to growl. The whole thing is totally ridiculous.\"</p> <p>UK Muslim leaders condemned the US action. \"The United States is shutting down its house, building walls around itself,\" Anas Altikriti, a spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain, said. </p> <p>The US department for homeland security said the intelligence community had recently obtained information that \"further heightens concern\" about Mr Islam. \"Yusuf Islam has been placed on the watch lists because of activities that could potentially be related to terrorism,\" spokesman Brian Doyle said. \"It's a serious matter.\"</p> <p>Another spokesman, Dennis Murphy, said the case highlighted the need for the US government to take over the task of checking airline passengers against watch lists. Currently, airlines can only check against no-fly lists, which contain fewer names.</p> <p>US authorities maintained Mr Islam's name was also on the no-fly list United Airlines should have checked, although a spokesman for the airline maintained that \"the information did not match\".</p> <p>Officials reviewing the list in the US discovered Mr Islam's name as his flight was in the air, resulting in the diversion to Maine.</p> <p>\"They diverted the plane at the last moment to a place called Bangor, which I'd never heard of, and suddenly I was surrounded by FBIs who interrogated me,\" Mr Islam said today. \"I wasn't handcuffed or anything like that.

  "Judges usually meet an awkward, foot-shifting silence when, having heard the case, they inquire whether the wrong-doer has anything to say for him or herself. <p>But given her day in court yesterday, Lucy Ferry, the former wife of pop star Bryan Ferry, launched a withering attack on the government.</p> <p>The socialite and sometime model appeared before a judge at Bow Street magistrates court for obstructing the highway during last week's pro-hunting demos in London. Her son Otis was one of the men who stormed the Commons chamber.</p> <p>Mrs Ferry said the protesters would continue fighting until Tony Blair had been brought down.</p> <p>\"I have quite a lot to say,\" she told district judge Chris-topher Pratt. Her decision to block Parliament Square was, she said, a political statement. \"I am very angry. And so are thousands of other people.\" The hunting bill was \"an attack on the freedom of a minority of people\".</p> <p>\"[The bill] is a sacrifice to the backbenchers for supporting Mr Blair's other policies,\" she said. \"We are disgusted by Mr Blair's lies, and we can bring this government down.\"</p> <p>Looking ahead to the Labour party conference, she said: \"Brighton is next and we will keep fighting.\"</p> <p>Mrs Ferry, a mother of four, claimed that Alun Michael, the rural affairs minister, \"cannot leave London\" because of the strength of feeling against the government's stance on hunting.</p> <p>Mrs Ferry, 45, who lives in west London, arrived at court with Otis Ferry's girlfriend, Jacqueline Coward, laughing and joking, dressed in an embroidered tweed coat, sunglasses and a woolly hat.</p> <p>Both women pleaded guilty to unlawfully obstructing the highway.</p> <p>The court heard that early last Wednesday the women pulled up at traffic lights in front of a police vehicle and left their cars blocking the road. Police asked them to move their vehicles but they refused.</p> <p>Judge Pratt told Mrs Ferry: \"I understand the views you have expressed. You have a right to demonstrate lawfully but if you break the law, it has to be dealt with.\"</p> <p>Both women were given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay \u00a340 costs. They said they could pay immediately. Miss Coward, a student at Newcastle University, added: \"I've brought my card.\"</p> <p>The women left court arm- in-arm and went to a nearby office to pay the costs for the six-minute hearing.</p> <p>Later Mrs Ferry reappeared and asked reporters: \"What happened to the middle way in all this? I think hunting people are quite happy to be licensed and if Tony Blair uses the Parliament Act on this, he is going to be the laughing stock of Europe and America and anyone who has any intelligence.\"</p> <p>Asked if campaigners could bring down the government over the issue, Mrs Ferry said: \"I believe we can.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the rural affairs minister did manage to get out of the capital yesterday, and tried to outflank pro-hunt campaigners.</p> <p>Mr Michael has been trying to avoid Countryside Alliance sympathisers since last week's scenes in Westminster, aband-oning, on police advice, an event at the weekend to mark the introduction of \"right to roam\" legislation.</p> <p>When he arrived at a conference in Exeter yesterday there were two protesters, watched by two dozen police officers, to meet him.</p> <p>However by the time he left around 200 banner-waving opponents of the bill had gathered to demonstrate.</p> <p>Alison Hawes, the Countryside Alliance's south-west regional director, said Mr Michael \"jiggled the timings\" to miss the protesters. \"He has been trying to avoid us for some time,\" she said.</p>",
  "The Chapman brothers, Dinos and Jake, are to embark on one of the most ambitious efforts ever to remake a destroyed work of art by creating a new version of their vast sculpture, Hell, destroyed by the fire at the Momart warehouse in Leyton, east London, in May. <p>Hell, a diorama which took the Chapmans more than two years to construct, using thousands of plastic soldiers, was bought by Charles Saatchi for \u00a3500,000. Mounted in glass cases arranged in the shape of a swastika, it showed scenes of torture and mass killing. It was said to be one of Mr Saatchi's favourites and was widely regarded as the most significant artwork to be lost in the blaze.</p> <p>The new work will not be called Hell, Dinos Chapman told the Guardian. \"It's a bigger, better version of Hell,\" he said. \"It would be a stupid waste of time to remake that [original] but we are going to make a sculpture that will be a bigger, better version.\"</p> <p>Hell was one of scores of artworks destroyed in the Momart fire, thought to have been caused by arson following a break-in in a neighbouring industrial unit in the early hours of Monday May 24.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the warehouse was rented from a local household removals firm, Goldstar Removals. Momart's managing director, Eugene Boyle, refused to comment on what fire protection the Momart warehouse had, or why it had rented storage space in a building shared with dozens of other businesses.</p> <p>\"We have at all times implemented any recommendations made by surveyors in relation to any of our facilities,\" he said. </p> <p>Momart's insurers, Heath Lambert, told the Guardian that neither they nor their underwriters have concerns about fire security at the destroyed warehouse. However, two Momart clients who lost work in the fire, Shirley Conran and Gillian Ayres, are planning legal action against the company.</p> <p>The report of the fire brigade investigation says the burglar alarm in the unit where the fire began - which was not under Momart's control - was broken. </p> <p><b> theguardian.com/artsG2 special</b><br></p>",
  "<p>A new superstrain of the flu virus capable of triggering a global pandemic could emerge from east Asia, health officials have warned. </p> <p>Scientists working for the World Health Organisation fear that the arrival of the flu season in Asian countries could see the human flu virus merge with a lethal strain of bird flu that is already in circulation, producing a more deadly flu virus that could rapidly infect humans, leading to a global outbreak.</p> <p>Recent cases of flu in Thailand have been reported in areas already struggling to control the spread of bird flu, a virus that mostly affects poultry, but has claimed the lives of at least four people in recent months.</p> <p>Health officials warn that people living in regions where the viruses are circulating could catch both at once, raising the prospect of a new and highly virulent form of human flu emerging.</p> <p>\"The reality is that if these two viruses meet, they will exchange genetic information and a new virus could emerge that's as pathogenic as the bird flu virus, but as infectious as human flu. It's a real scenario for the emergence of a pandemic,\" Klaus St\u00f6hr, head of the WHO's influenza programme, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Bird flu affected 10 Asian countries last year, killing at least 18 people and tens of millions of birds. It returned this year with outbreaks in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. To prevent people becoming infected with both bird flu and human flu, the WHO recommends that those at greatest risk, such as poultry farmers, be vaccinated against human flu or take antiviral drugs.</p> <p>But with more than 95% of the world's doses of flu vaccine sold to developed countries, stocks in poorer regions are so low that many countries have little, if any, to give out.</p> <p>The Thai health ministry last week said it would try to vaccinate poultry workers in affected areas, but with only 100,000 donated doses of vaccine, local officials admit they do not have enough to prevent both viruses spreading.</p> <p>Writing in New Scientist, Prasert Thongcharoen of Mahidol University in Bangkok, a member of the WHO's expert committee on viral diseases, said: \"We do not have sufficient vaccine to prevent co-circulation.\"</p>",
  "President Bush held an hour-long meeting with Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, in New York yesterday, in talks dominated by the campaign to overwhelm al-Qaida and Taliban fighters along the porous Pakistan-Afghanistan border. <p>General Musharraf is an important US ally in its \"war on terror\" and Washington has softened rhetoric urging the military ruler to restore democracy after his 1999 seizure of power. </p> <p>In yesterday's talks, Mr Bush briefly touched on the general's decision to retain military as well as political control in Pakistan beyond the end of the year, a move that flouts a previous commitment. </p> <p>A US official said the president had tried to nudge Pakistan into \"moving forward with democratic institutions,\" but did not press Mr Musharraf to keep his promise. </p> <p>Instead, the exchange focused on Islamabad's efforts to root out al-Qaida and Taliban elements in the remote tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. Some 200 Pakistani forces have been killed in an offensive that started about a year ago. </p> <p>At least one Pakistani paramilitary member was killed by suspected militants in an attack on a convoy there yesterday. </p> <p>The two leaders also talked about how to stamp out the last remnants of the network of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, who admitted in February to passing nuclear technology to other countries. </p> <p>But Mr Bush did not press Mr Musharraf to allow US agents to interview Dr Khan, a point of contention for the Americans.</p>",
  "<p>In the early hours of Monday May 24, a CCTV camera overlooking an industrial unit on a business park in Leyton, east London, was deliberately tampered with. A burglar or burglars then broke into the unit, bypassing its metal door by boring in through a brick wall, and began to steal the contents: watches, cordless phones, DVD players and fax machines. </p> <p>What happened next has been investigated by the police, 13 fire brigade specialists and a dog trained to sniff out the kind of fluids arsonists use. They are still not sure what happened, but according to the fire investigation report, which has been seen by the Guardian, the flames that caught between 1.45am and 3.15am that morning were started deliberately. </p> <p>The unit was one of 34 housed in a building on the Cromwell Industrial Estate, converted from an old factory once used by Chubb, the lockmakers. Most of the units, like the one burgled, were small square spaces with steel shuttered doorways opening off the building's long sides. They were home to all sorts of prides, joys and nice little earners; there was a carpenter's shop, a car workshop, a cleaning business, a steel fabrication outfit, firms run by families, friends, lone entrepreneurs, some ephemeral, some long-established, all steering the small business person's perilous course between profit, loss and the taxman. </p> <p>Running down through the centre of the building, however, like the nave through a cathedral, were two much larger rooms, each some 60m long and 15m wide. One of these belonged to a small London household removals company, Goldstar Removals, which did not have the volume of business needed to fill it. Accordingly, since 1996, Goldstar had been renting it, as a warehouse, to a different sort of concern: Momart, Britain's most successful handlers, packers and shippers of artworks. Locked away in this space that night, packed in foam and handmade wooden crates, was a store of 20th-century British art, the size, breadth and richness of which no private collector has rivalled. </p> <p>There was Patrick Heron's Vertical Light, painted at his home in the Eagle's Nest in Cornwall in 1957, strokes of brilliant colour which Heron declared belonged to \"the realm of pure visual sensation\" and which his biographer Mel Gooding numbered among the most spectacularly beautiful paintings made anywhere since 1945. There was Gillian Ayres' enormous canvas Altair, more than three metres square, painted in 1989 with her characteristic thick ruts and peaks of oil paint, energetic with shades of blue. Almost as large was Craigie Horsfield's black and white photograph of Barcelona, Carrer Muntaner, unimaginably hard to print, taken one night in 1996 as part of a project that lasted three-and-a-half years. There was Hell, by Jake and Dinos Chapman, fabricated from 1998 to 2000, portraying mass slaughter and torture in thousands of plastic soldiers and paint. There was an old blue wooden beach hut from Whitstable which Tracey Emin bought with Sarah Lucas and sold to Charles Saatchi in 2000 for \u00a375,000 under the title The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here, as well as a tent whose embroidered names gave the work its title, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995. Only a curator of extraordinary crassness or soaring imagination would have considered putting these works, and the scores of others in the warehouse, in a single exhibition, but that night, fire was the curator. Nobody would ever see these works again. </p> <p>Michael Craig-Martin, whose painting Mood Change One was one of the Saatchi-owned works destroyed, is a bridge between the two sets of British artists affected by the fire, the abstract painters of the 1960s and 1970s like Heron and Ayres, whom he knew, and the conceptual artists who were young in the 1990s, such as Damien Hirst, whom he taught. He argued that the loss that night was far greater than has yet been understood in Britain, even though he does not consider there were any masterpieces there. </p> <p>\"There's an idea that the only thing in the arts is masterpieces,\" he said. \"Very little of it is . . . the fabric of a culture is to do with lots of people making lots of things and that's the culture, the richness of that fabric. It seems to me that in this fire enough was lost, certainly by certain people, that the fabric of that record, of that continuity, is lost. If you lose most of Patrick Heron's work, if big chunks of things are lost, if big chunks of early work are lost ... I think there are very few cultural equivalents of fire damaging quite so many artworks. There are famous library fires but this isn't quite the same. I never remember anything in my lifetime that is the equivalent.</p> <p>\"I lost one work in this fire. It happens. For a hundred artists to lose work simultaneously - whoa! For certain artists to lose 40 or 50 works simultaneously - that's unbelievable.\" </p> <p>Momart had its own entrances to the Cromwell estate warehouse, and was isolated from the other units internally by breezeblock walls. But by choosing a space which ran between dozens of local small businesses in a single building, the art movers, with their golden reputation, their blue-chip client list - the Queen, the Tates, the Smithsonian, Charles Saatchi, Damien Hirst - their millions of pounds in turnover and their staff of more than 100 had chosen to share the fates of an arbitrary group of East End entrepreneurs whose vulnerabilities and security systems they had no power to control. </p> <p>The burgled unit, number 47, was at the extreme south-western corner of the building, as far away from the Momart space - number 49 - as it could have been. Yet the fire, its initial intensity created by the ignition of several tonnes of highly flammable, plastic-rich consumer electronics which took the temperature inside the space to greater than 1,100C - was able to spread throughout the building before the alarm was raised. The lessee of the unit, who specialised in reconditioning cordless phones returned to retailers as faulty, told fire investigators that his burglar alarm wasn't working before the fire. His was not a high-end operation. His unit was so stuffed with consumer electronics that they were even blocking the toilet. \"It is understood,\" remarked the fire investigators laconically, \"that the occupier only worked there when there was natural light.\" </p> <p>Momart refused to answer questions about its fire security, but there is no evidence that it or any of the other unit owners and lessees had effective 24-hour monitoring systems in place to warn of fire. It does not appear that there were security guards on duty, either in the Momart warehouse or in any other part of the building. A set of CCTV cameras, operated for Waltham Forest council by the authorities in a neighbouring borough, Enfield, can see the building from nearby Argall Avenue, and their output is monitored 24 hours a day. But with 160 cameras to watch, the handful of staff on duty didn't spot the fire on their screens, and only turned the cameras towards the warehouse when the police alerted them, 12 minutes after the fire brigade was called. Even if the cameras had been pointed in the right direction the fire would have been hard to see on screen until it had either pierced the roof or broken through internal walls to one of the two large spaces, which had skylights. </p> <p>In fact, that is what happened. It was householders and night workers coming to and from shifts, rather than any paid security operative, who first raised the alarm when they saw the flames smacking at the darkness. </p> <p><strong> Ash and vapour</strong><br> </p> <p>London fire brigade logged the first emergency call at 3.43am on Monday. Initially, despatchers told crews simply that they were heading for a \"fire in a factory\". Three fire ap pliances and a hose-laying unit were assigned, with a fourth appliance as the calls continued to come in. The doors of fire stations in Leyton, Homerton, Walthamstow, Edmonton and Stoke Newington opened and disgorged engines into the deserted streets. It was so quiet that the first crew arrived at the scene within five minutes. They realised at once that they had a rare inferno on their hands and requested two more fire appliances from brigade control. At 3.58am, they sought further resources: two aerial platforms for directing water down into the building through the vents in the roof opened up by the fire. At 4.06am, the firefighting team sent back their first terse summary of the situation: a \"range of factories\", in a building 125m by 40m, was 70% alight in \"a very severe fire\". Five minutes later, they called for two more fire engines. It was an eight-pump fire; within hours, there would be 15. It was turning into one of London's biggest fires for years. </p> <p>The sun was coming up, and still none of the firefighters had any idea what was in the building, let alone that there were valuable artworks in unit 49. London Fire Brigade has a computerised database called the Central Risk Register, or CRR. Its main purpose is to warn fire crews of special hazards in particular buildings, but it also carries records of art and historical objects in London's museums and galleries. On the database are last-ditch rescue plans in the event of the worst happening to a building like the National Gallery. </p> <p>\"There would be a priority list available which would, in the event of a fire, say: 'Go into the room on the left, take the first four paintings,'\" said Senior Divisional Officer Gary Fredericks. \"We'd sit down with people in an art gallery and work out a salvage strategy, what pictures to rescue first, which could entail cutting them from their frames. Which is obviously the quickest way. You would rather lose a couple of inches around the edge than the whole painting.\" </p> <p>The fire brigade does not solicit entries to the CRR; they say there is no reason why Momart could not have approached them to register the presence of artworks in Unit 49, although it would have been unusual. Anyway, Momart did not do so. On the morning of May 24, it was a moot point whether it would have made any difference. </p> <p>The upgrading of the fire to an eight-pump incident triggered the despatch of Fredericks to the scene at 4.13am from his home in Bow, east London. When he opened his front door he smelled burning, although his house was four miles away down the valley of the river Lea. From the T-junction at the end of his road, in the dawn light, he could see the smoke. \"I arrived at the industrial estate, parked my car out of the way and put my fire gear on,\" he said. \"I could actually hear the fire from a hundred yards away. It was roaring.\" </p> <p>The scene was one of organised bedlam as the fire crews rushed to fight the fire; unreeling hoses, setting up relays to use more powerful hydrants on the nearby Lea Bridge Road, diving into the burning building to take the water right to the flames. Studying the site, however, Fredericks and his colleague, Brendan McAlone, were worried. Among the first thing the firefighters had done was to haul dozens of gas cylinders from the units on either side of the Momart warehouse and line them up against a wall. The various small businesses with premises there had been using an extraordinary range of gases: acetylene, oxygen, propane, argon. </p> <p>Fredericks knew there were likely to be more such cylinders inside, and that in the intense heat of the fire they were likely to begin exploding, putting the lives of his men at risk. At the forefront of his mind was the knowledge that the previous day, a 29-year-old firefighter had been killed in an explosion in a burning building in Cardiff, most likely the result of a gas cylinder exploding. At one point, Fredericks followed a length of hose which went right inside the burning building and found two firefighters there, directing water on to the flames. </p> <p>\"What are you trying to do?\" he asked them. </p> <p>\"Aggressively trying to control the fire,\" they said. </p> <p>Fredericks ordered them out, back against the wall of a neighbouring building. By 4.48am, little more than an hour after the first emergency call, the firefighters were telling control that the building was \"100% alight\". Sure that there were no lives at risk inside, sure that the building was doomed, concerned for the safety of firefighters and to defend the businesses on the rest of the estate, Fredericks and McAlone switched tactics. To mimimise the risk from exploding cylinders, they pulled everyone back at least 200m from the fire, and for the next two days poured water on to the remnants of the building from aerial platforms and monitors - hose-carrying devices set on the ground. </p> <p>For the sake of the firemen's lives, it was a wise move. A video shot by the fire brigade shows an enormous orange fireball leaping out of one side of the building as a cylinder explodes. </p> <p>\"From an experienced fire officer perspective, the whole building was a loss in the very early stages,\" said Fredericks. \"It was very obvious to me that we weren't going to save the building or its contents, but we could save the surrounding buildings. </p> <p>\"I wasn't prepared to risk firefighters' lives to extinguish a fire in a building which was pretty much lost anyway. We didn't know what was in the building but we knew there was no life risk.\" </p> <p>Would he have acted any differently if he had known what was inside the Goldstar Removals warehouse? </p> <p>Fredericks paused for a moment. \"I would be very reluctant,\" he said, \"to put firefighters' lives at risk for art.\" </p> <p>No one saw the art burn, but it would have made congenial tinder. The oil paint with which Ayres and Heron had thickly covered their large canvases with such panache would long before have yielded up its volatile elements, but the canvas itself, its wooden frames and the wooden boxes would have been quickly-consumed fuel. The tent that Emin used as the basis for her work may have been treated with fire-retarding chemicals but this only inhibits ignition, not burning. The fact that pictures tend to be stored vertically, rather than horizontally, would have helped the fire. </p> <p>We imagine an uncontrolled fire leaping visibly from object to adjacent object. In an enclosed space, this is not what happens. Heat, gas and smoke rise from the first area of ignition to begin to heat up the area just below the ceiling. When that reaches a temperature of about 600C, a phenomenon known as \"flashover\" occurs: everything flammable on the ground can burst into flame at once. Most of the works in Momart's keeping would have turned to ash and vapour very quickly. </p> <p>One of the few items to survive even partly was the work considered by the late sculptor William Redgrave to be his best, a bronze triptych, weighing about a tonne, called The Event, made up of 49 vignettes of ordinary people smitten by history during small, intimate moments of their lives: kissing, smoking, singing, flirting, praying. \"Some great outside thing is happening to these people - something we all fear might be going to happen,\" Redgrave said after its completion in 1966. It took three years to make and a few hours to smash to pieces. Redgrave's son Chris managed to salvage about a third of the central panel from the ruins of the warehouse before it was levelled by the local council. Only five days earlier, the family had paid \u00a35,508 to Momart in back fees for storing the sculpture. Chris Redgrave appears to be the only artist or relative of an artist to have visited the site. </p> <p>\"[Momart] were using victim language in talking to us,\" said Redgrave. \"They were saying: 'We are a small company, we can't believe this has happened.' I'm sure that's true, they wouldn't have wanted this to happen, but this building was inappropriate for what they are doing. There's no way around that.\" </p> <p>It was a hot day when Redgrave clambered on to the rubble to search for fragments of his father's work. He had been reading his father's diaries, about the war years, when his father had worked as an air-raid warden, and the piles of bricks and mangled steel made him think of the blitz. \"There was a smell of rotting food, rotting chips, rotting meat from one of the units Momart shared the building with,\" he recalled. \"There were bits of glass hanging from the roof. I had to climb over steel girders. It looked like a twisted rollercoaster that had crashed.\" </p> <p>Redgrave began to see scorched bronze heads from the sculpture and, with only a pair of gardening gloves to protect his hands, started to wrench them out of the rubble. Fragments of glass were everywhere, the gloves soon became useless, and he cut his hands badly. In two trips to the site, he rescued dozens of pieces of the sculpture, now laid out in the kitchen and the garden of the London home of Jill Pearson, a former features writer on the Times, who, as William Redgrave's girlfriend in Chelsea in the 1960s, watched him create the work. </p> <p>Because no artist intentionally created them as such, the fire-damaged fragments of sculpture would probably not be counted as an art work by those that do the counting, but the way some of the scorched bronze heads have been altered does evoke nightmares of people trapped in bombed, burning buildings. In one, drops of glass have fused into the eye sockets of a figure who appears to be screaming in pain. </p> <p>William Redgrave, who died in 1986, made bronze busts of 1970s celebrities: Francis Bacon, Laurence Olivier, Adrian Boult, Diana Rigg and Henry Cooper and, when The Event was exhibited at the Royal Academy, conservative newspapers wrote glowing notices. It would have been odd if, some four decades later, the media and public rejoiced at the fire which brought about the sculpture's near-destruction, and the obliteration of so many other works by his contemporaries. Yet that is exactly what happened. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/britartfire/story/0,14634,1310820,00.html\">Read part two of Art into ashes</a></p>",
  "<p>So few scientific studies have looked at the question, that the only safe bet is that more rural howls will be met with more urban cheers as the two sides continue to oppose each other, as they did last week. </p> <p>What a ban would do for fox numbers is uncertain. While some pro-hunting groups say populations would explode if not kept in check by hunting, others argue that that might not be the case. During the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, Stephen Harris and his team at Bristol University used the temporary hunting ban to estimate fox populations before and after it was imposed. They concluded, in a paper in Nature, that the ban had no measurable impact on fox numbers. </p> <p>The study was later criticised by scientists at the independent Game Conservancy Trust and Oxford University, who claimed that the study used inappropriate statistics. </p> <p>According to Jonathan Reynolds, of the Game Conservancy Trust, the impact of a ban will vary from region to region. He argues that in areas such as west Norfolk, where shooting dominates, a hunting ban will have little effect on fox numbers, as the vast majority are killed by \"lamping\", when groups drive around at night with a foglamp and shoot foxes caught in the spotlight. In parts of Wales where hunts claim more foxes, a ban could trigger an increase in the local fox population, says Reynolds. </p> <p>A hunting ban could also change how the countryside looks. Some 23,000 hectares of woodland in England and Wales are managed by foxhunts, roughly double that found in nature reserves. Without an incentive to maintain the woodlands, which provide cover for foxes, those areas of woodland may become less well conserved.</p>",

  "<p>A TV company in India is fighting a court action brought by Rupert Murdoch who blocked it getting rights to a key cricket Test series after his TV operation in the region told a judge its rival was not \"experienced\" enough for the gig.</p> <p>Zee Telefilms today returned to court in a bid to overthrow an earlier ruling in which ESPN Star Sports, a joint venture between Mr Murdoch's News Corp and Disney, successfully claimed that the company did not meet the terms of the tender as it was not an \"experienced sports broadcaster\". </p> <p>India's cricket board walked away on Tuesday from a $308m deal with Zee to broadcast the nation's home games for four years, in the face of a legal challenge from unsuccessful bidder ESPN Star Sports. </p> <p>The International Cricket Council and Australian cricket authorities have both warned that the upcoming Test series between India and Australia, fervently anticipated by the country's rabid cricket fans, could be cancelled if the bitter legal wrangle is not settled. </p> <p>But Zee said today it would take its case to the supreme court arguing it still held the rights to show India's home games for the next four years, starting with the first of four Tests against Australia from October 6. </p> <p>\"We are moving the supreme court today against the Board of Control for Cricket in India,\" a spokesman for Zee said. \"We maintain that BCCI has a binding contract with us.\" </p> <p>The stakes are huge because cricket has the same impact in attracting pay-TV consumers in India as Premier League football has in the UK.

A spokesman told Reuters that there was no time to call for fresh bids ahead of the Australia series so it would announce a short-term solution in a day or two and review long-term arrangements later. </p> <p>In another parallel with the situation in the UK around five years ago, the Indian cricket board had negotiated more than six times the amount it received in its last rights deal. </p> <p>But the agreement was pitched into confusion on Tuesday when ESPN Star Sports challenged the Indian board in court, claiming Zee was too inexperienced in sports broadcasting to be a qualified bidder. </p> <p>The Indian board told a Bombay court it had no final contract with Zee because the broadcaster had wanted to negotiate some terms before accepting the rights. </p> <p>In an echo of the row between ITV Digital and the Football League in this country two years ago, Zee argued it had made a $20m downpayment to secure the deal. </p> <p>Australia's cricket board has said it would reconsider the tour of India if the dispute was not resolved, while a lack of TV cameras would upset the ICC, as there would be no replays to check close decisions. </p> <p>Once India's leading TV network, Zee now trails News Corp's Star and another foreign rival, Sony Entertainment. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Janet Jackson's infamous breast-baring exploits during live coverage of the Super Bowl has cost the already troubled broadcaster CBS a record $550,000 fine for violating decency rules</p> <p>More than 542,000 viewers complained to the media regulator about the incident in May, which occurred during the game's half-time show when the singer was performing a duet with Justin Timberlake. It prompted a nationwide debate on taste and decency. </p> <p>The record fine will only add to what has been a miserable week for CBS, following the broadcaster's admission that a programme claiming President George Bush received special treatment during his military service was \"deeply flawed\".</p> <p>The broadcaster admitted documents used in the programme were likely to be forged and said it should never have broadcast the story, despite standing by it for two weeks. </p> <p>The federal communications commission said it had voted to fine 20 CBS stations a maximum $27,500 each after ruling that the bare flesh finale to the performance, during the most watched TV event of the year, was deliberate. </p> <p>At the time Jackson said it was an accident while Timberlake famously blamed the incident on a \"wardrobe malfunction\". </p> <p>\"The US constitution is generous in its protection of free expression, but it is not a licence to thrill,\" said the FCC chairman, Michael Powell. \"The context of the half-time show leads us to conclude that the breast-baring finale was intended.\" </p> <p>The watchdog decided against fining the other 200-plus CBS affiliates that broadcast the show but are not owned by the network, stating they were not involved in the planning, selection or approval of the half-time festivities. </p> <p>US media giant Viacom, which owns CBS, also owns the MTV network, which was involved in producing the programme. </p> <p>The FCC said Jackson's partial nudity was in apparent violation of the broadcast indecency standard, but decided against taking action against other parts of the broadcast as well as commercials despite other complaints. </p> <p>In the wake of a national outcry in America over the incident, the FCC instigated a crackdown on television and radio stations to the point that many broadcasters have now implemented tape delays of live events to ensure they do not fall foul of the rules. </p> <p>The $27,500 fine is the maximum currently allowed by law although congress is considering legislation to raise that to as much as $500,000 per incident. </p> <p>FCC commissioner Jonathan Adelstein opposed the decision to only fine the CBS-owned stations, noting that the fine was paltry compared with the $2.3m the network earned on average for a 30-second commercial during the game. </p> <p>\"Today's enforcement action goes out of its way to focus narrowly on the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast on 20 CBS-owned stations,\" he said. </p> <p>CBS argued that it had no advance knowledge of the stunt and did not believe indecency rules had been violated.</p> <p>\"We are extremely disappointed in the ruling,\" the broadcaster said in a statement. \"We are reviewing all of our options to respond to the ruling.\" </p> <p>Viacom has 30 days to decide whether to pay the fine or contest the ruling.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Vanessa Redgrave arrived in Bournemouth last night to publicise the plight of the British detainees being held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay by the American military. <p>Accompanied by the father of detainee Moazzam Begg, who has been kept in solitary confinement for three years in the US base in Cuba, and released detainee Jamal al-Harith, the actor praised the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, for keeping the issue alive in the Commons.</p> <p>She also claimed that the British government was covering up the number of detainees being held around the world in the \"war against terror\".</p> <p>Speaking to a packed fringe at the Lib Dem conference, Mr Begg, who has not seen his son since he was arrested in Pakistan in November 2001, revealed he would be flying to Cuba soon courtesy of the British government.</p> <p>But, claiming that he had had four meetings with the Foreign Office postponed before the flights had been agreed, he described his experience of being \"treated like dirt\" by the government.</p> <p>Mr Begg was told last Thursday by the Foreign Office that they will support his application to visit his son at the US naval base detention centre on Cuba. </p> <p>He will be accompanied by a psychiatrist and by Labour peer Lord Rea, who is a medically-qualified lawyer. </p> <p>\"When we went to the Foreign Office we were treated like dirt, absolute dirt,\" he told the around 150 delegates squeezed into the meeting. \"I was wondering what had happened to the character of the nation.\" </p> <p>He said four meetings had been arranged and then cancelled by the government before he eventually got to see Foreign Office minister Lady Symons. </p> <p>He said he was very pleased to have received the minister's backing but was waiting for a letter of confirmation before he would truly believe it. </p> <p>It only emerged last year that Mr Begg, from Birmingham, was being detained at the camp after being seized in Pakistan in 2001. </p> <p>Also speaking at the meeting was Lib Dem peer and MEP Sarah Ludford who said that she was \"outraged by the failure of the EU to present a common front to the US\" in an effort to put pressure on the authorities to resolve the situation.</p> <p>Ms Redgrave lambasted the media for allegedly downplaying the plight of the captives in Guant\u00e1namo, criticising the media for using the term \"detainee\" rather than \"prisoners\" and \"ill-treatment\" rather than \"torture\".</p> <p>Her case was backed by another speaker, LSE professor of international law Conor Gearty, who said \"Language is important - it is being used to split opposition [to Guant\u00e1namo] by calling torture 'controlled mistreatment'.\"</p> <p>He said that the US treatment of its prisoners was \"stupid and counter-productive. You don't get people to tell you the truth by beating people up.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Airline wrong about visa - but won't pay up</strong><br> Airline security is a curious business. In the same week that a reader tells me how his wife was waved on to a flight despite (inadvertently) bearing a cancelled passport, I hear of New Zealander Garth Cartwright, who was barred from boarding a plane from Heathrow to Macedonia because he did not have a visa. </p> <p>In vain he pointed out that he did not need one. He exhibited his Lonely Planet guide confirming this and showed numerous previous entry and exit stamps to Macedonia in his passport, but the officious Austrian Airlines representative was unimpressed. \"With considerable rudeness she called me a liar and suggested I had entered Macedonia illegally before,\" says Cartwright, who had to miss his flight, for which he had paid \u00a3291. </p> <p>He called the Austrian Airlines headquarters in Vienna and was reassured that New Zealand passport holders did not need a visa to enter Macedonia. He was advised to get a letter from the Macedonian embassy confirming this in case ground staff decided to bar him again. </p> <p>Cold comfort indeed, for his first flight was non-refundable and his only option was to book and pay for another. Plus he had to spend half a day at the embassy while a letter was drafted for him to wave at check-in staff. He eventually reached his destination three days later than planned, having run up alarming phone bills cancelling hotel bookings and rescheduling meetings. </p> <p> <strong> A call to the Macedonian embassy confirms that New Zealand passport holders have not needed a visa to enter the country for the past couple of years, but Austrian Airlines still insists that it acted correctly. Its ground staff glean the latest travel requirements from a travel information manual issued by the international airlines regulator Iata, and the edition for last October apparently stated that a visa was necessary. The following month's issue requires no such document, however, so, according to the airline, \"We have to assume that the Macedonian authorities have since amended their requirements\". </strong> </p> <p><strong>All very odd and I'm still waiting to hear from Iata as to where it got its erroneous information from. In the meantime, Austrian Airlines has decided that the alleged rudeness of its ground staff is a much more serious business and has offered Cartwright a free business-class trip to eastern Europe. A beautiful gesture, except that he no longer travels to the region. He would prefer a cheque to cover the expenses involved in rescheduling his flight but sadly Austrian Airlines is immovable on that one.</strong> </p> <p> <strong> They took the money - but where's the window?</strong><br> Anyone who has glanced at this column over the summer will know that when it comes to replacing doors and windows, the double-glazing firm Coldseal should be bottom of the list. First, there was the case of the reader who mistakenly sent payment for works directly to Coldseal instead of to the bank which had financed his credit agreement. Instead of passing the cheque on, Coldseal cashed it and hung on to the money for a year while the customer was harried for interest payments. Then we heard from a man who had signed up for remedial works by Coldseal, only to be told, six months later, that the company couldn't fulfil the contract after all. Not that it saw that as a reason to return his hefty deposit and it took the fearsome might of Consumer to wrest the money back again. </p> <p>Now there's an SOS from Yorkshire, where Beth Lindemann has been living for the past nine months behind a plank of wood instead of a window. Coldseal were booked to replace her windows back in January, but the fitters discovered that they didn't have a glass pane for a new door they had provided so they boarded it up and departed. After two months the fitters turned up on the wrong day and found nobody at home. By the time Lindemann had tracked them down the glass panel had gone missing and had to be reordered. There followed another two-month delay, after which the fitters arrived, but not the glass, which had once again mysteriously vanished from the Coldseal warehouse. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Lindemann has already paid for the job and her local Trading Standards advises that legal action is her only route. </p> <p> <strong> There's a chance that it may not come to that thanks to our energetic friend at Coldseal's PR company. An official has been round to inspect the door and an installation date has been organised for tomorrow. Whether the glass will turn up along with the workmen is another matter. </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Life savings entrusted to the postal system</strong> <br> For a daily dose of suspense, thrills and horror, where else do you turn but the Post Office? There's the suspense of wondering whether your mail will actually turn up, the thrill if it does and, more likely, the horror when yet another morning passes without the rattle of the letterbox. </p> <p>Given the number of items that are delayed, lost and, occasionally, plundered each year, it seems extraordinary that banks should be encouraging us to entrust our life savings to the postal system. John Welch has learned that Alliance &amp; Leicester is to close his local branch in Islington and that it advises customers to conduct future transactions by post. They are even expected to mail off their pass books if they need updating. Welch is dismayed and has written twice to the bank asking what responsibility it would take if payments are lost or misappropriated. So far he has not received a sensible reply. </p> <p> <strong> As more and more bank branches withdraw from the high street, the reliability of postal banking is likely to become a big issue. Alliance &amp; Leicester's response is not reassuring, although it insists that lost items are rare and carefully investigated. If a cheque sent by one of its surviving branches to a customer were to be intercepted and cashed, the matter would have to be reported to the police and a crime number obtained before the bank would investigate. Then, if fraud could be proved, the account holder would be reimbursed. If a cheque sent by a customer met a similar fate, he or she would have to trust that the company who had issued it had similar procedures in place and would raise a replacement if theft was proven. </strong> </p> <p><strong>It's a good idea to ring the company and check its procedures in case of fraud before entrusting the cheque to the post, Alliance &amp; Leicester advises blithely. There's just as much hassle involved if a cheque simply vanishes in the post since the account holder would have to get it stopped and a new one issued. It is possible to pay a cheque in at the Post Office, but you only get a receipt for the envelope, not for the amount.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Write to us at 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Manchester police have cancelled a concert tonight by Buju Banton, the Jamaican reggae singer whose lyrics contain references to shooting and throwing acid on gay people, for fear of public disorder. <p>The decision coincides with a Crown Prosecution Service investigation into whether Banton and three other Jamaican stars should be prosecuted for lyrics that allegedly incite violence against gays. </p> <p>Banton, who is currently on tour, was to perform at the Bierkeller in Manchester this evening, but after receiving protests from gay rights campaigners and consulting residents, Greater Manchester police decided to stop it. </p> <p>An attempt to hold it at the Big Western was also stopped. </p> <p>\"Intelligence gathered about previous appearances of the artist and the implications of his previous performances suggest a likelihood of public disorder and the potential for disruption,\" a police spokesman said. </p> <p>\"Taking into account this intelligence and concerns from various agencies and community groups, the performance has been cancelled. Greater Manchester police accepts the right to public freedom of expression but does not encourage anything which could cause possible hate or dissension within any community.\" </p> <p>The Bierkeller, in the Piccadilly area, said: \"We're just here to put on gigs and we don't get involved in the politics. But the police just told us to pull it.\" </p> <p>The gay human rights group OutRage! thanked Manchester councillors and police for \"taking a stand against Mr Banton and his murder-music\", but criticised both venues. </p> <p>\"The Bierkeller and The Big Western should never have agreed to host him in the first place,\" its spokesman Peter Tatchell said. </p> <p>\"They would not sign a performer who advocated gassing Jews or lynching black people. Incitements to murder gays and lesbians are not acceptable either. They should not be rewarded with concert contracts.\" </p> <p>It is not the first time that the police have been asked to investigate Banton's tour. </p> <p>Metropolitan police officers attended his concert at the Coronet in Elephant and Castle, London, last Sunday after similar concerns were raised. </p> <p>\"We received a number of complaints about the event so we consulted with the local community and the performers and then provided a police presence to protect people,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>He said the Met kept a \"close eye on such events\" and the Association of Chief Police Officers and the CPS were examining the lyrics of Banton, Beenie Man, Elephant Man and Bounty Hunter to decide on the likelihood of a prosecution on criminal grounds. </p> <p>In June, Beenie Man was forced to cancel a London concert after the police told him he could be prosecuted. </p> <p>And in August the Met's racial and violent crimes task force sought CPS advice on the lyrics of the four dancehall performers. </p> <p>Although it decided then that a prosecution would be unlikely, the matter is now subject to a CPS review. </p> <p>Two weeks ago Elephant Man and Vybz Kartel, another reggae act accused of inciting violence against homosexuals, were dropped from the Music of Black Origin awards when they failed to give written apologies for their lyrics. </p> <p>Banton's most infamous song, Boom Bye Bye, includes the lines \"Boom bye bye inna batty bwoy head\" (Shoot a faggot in the head), \"Guy come near we then his skin must peel\" (If a gay man comes near us he'll get burnt with acid), and \"Burn him up bad like an old tire wheel\" (Burn him up bad like an old tyre).</p>",
  "Night-vision goggles pressed against their eyes and a carpet of stars glittering overhead, the Alpha Company patrol creep silently through the valley. <p>Dogs bark as the 20 soldiers pad past farmhouses and deserted almond orchards. Swinging right, they sweep infrared beams over the mountain line for signs of the enemy. Nothing. </p> <p>Sergeant First Class Jose Aranda halts before a bridge over a creek. The Taliban mounted a checkpoint here two days earlier, he whispers. They might return. The scouts crouch behind a rock, train an automatic rifle on the bridge, and wait. </p> <p>By dawn, only goats have strayed into their sights. The \"bad guys\" have eluded them again. \"The Taliban are hard to find,\" says Sgt Aranda, trudging back to base. \"We need good information from local people. But some of them are really against us.\" </p> <p>Rooting out the remnants of the Taliban has proved a maddening task for US forces in Afghanistan. Scattered and weakened the militia remain a slippery foe, hidden in the crevices of the mountains. But with landmark elections just weeks away, the hunt has gained fresh urgency. </p> <p>The US military is trying to quell the elusive insurgency with a mixture of friendship and force. One day its soldiers drill wells, build schools and perform lifesaving medical operations. The next they go hunting for Taliban. </p> <p>The American assumption that good works buy Afghan loyalty does not always hold true. And sometimes it can go disastrously wrong. </p> <p>During a medical patrol to help the sick in a remote village last Friday, commanding officer Captain Andrew Brosnan heard gunshots and mortar fire in a nearby valley. Suspecting bandits were attacking a truck convoy, he led an investigating team. As they mounted the slope his soldiers spotted two running figures in the distance. After a verbal warning and a warning shot, Capt Brosnan ordered his team to open fire. </p> <p>But when the approached the fallen \"enemy\", they discovered they had shot two children, Abdul Ali, 12, who was hit in the leg, and his brother Abdul Wali, 10, who had been shot in the head. By the time a Black Hawk helicopter landed to evacuate the wounded boys, Wali was dead. </p> <p>The Guardian did not witness the shooting and the 25th Infantry provincial commander, Lieutenant Colonel Terry Sellers, who was visiting Uruzgan at the time, ordered the troops involved not to speak about it. </p> <p>Camp Anaconda is one of about 30 \"fire bases\" - small, remote military camps scattered across southern and eastern Afghanistan - that are effectively the frontline of the hunt for the Taliban. Ananconda is in Uruzgan town, in the east of the restive eponymous province that was once a Taliban stronghold and birthplace of their leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. </p> <p>The 140 soldiers of Alpha Company, whose 25th Infantry Division is based in Hawaii, arrived early this summer. After a quiet welcome the base has come under sustained attack in the past month. </p> <p>Suspected Taliban have fired rocket-propelled grenades at the camp three times, though most of them exploded off the perimeter wall, and planted at least 10 roadside bombs designed to destroy passing US convoys. </p> <p>Although the attacks have caused no serious injuries, they have infuriated Capt Brosnan. His troops, he says, have built schools, dug wells and erected latrines in the town. His medics treat the sick and call in helicopter evacuations for patients in mortal danger. </p> <p>Yet the CO is frustrated that he has run into a wall of silence about the attacks. Even though some were launched from the busy town bazaar, nobody, it seems, knows anything. \"They wave, they smile. But someone out there knows what's going on - and they're not saying anything,\" said Specialist Melvin Krambule, a gunner atop an armour-plated Humvee. </p> <p>On Wednesday morning last week - two days before the boys were shot - an armoured convoy rumbled into the bazaar. US soldiers handed out matchboxes bearing Osama bin Laden's photo and details of the $25m (\u00a314m) reward for his capture. </p> <p>Then, gathering hundreds of local men in a circle around him, Capt Brosnan delivered a stern message. He had come to the townspeople \"in friendship\" two weeks earlier, he said, and outlined Alpha Company's development projects. He also appealed for information about the Taliban attacks. Despite that, he admonished, \"not one person here has helped me.\" </p> <p>Moments later, a US jet cracked across the sky in a choreographed show of force. \"Together we can build a better Afghanistan,\" he concluded. The townsmen, listening carefully as they hunkered under the morning sun, stood up and left. </p> <p>Several factors militate against the US mission. Many locals have vivid memories of the brutal decade-long Russian occupation. Many are also terrified of reprisals if they are seen as being associated with the US troops. </p> <p>For their part, the Americans, who rely on young translators flown in from Kabul, struggle to make sense of local feuds and tribal rivalries. \"People come to us denouncing suspects, but it's usually just a grudge against an old enemy,\" one sergeant said. </p> <p>Their heavy-handed style can also alienate locals. Camp Ananconda is ringed by barbed wire and sandbags, and supplied by huge Chinook helicopters that land in a fury of noise and dust. Soldiers only leave base with full body armour and a cocked gun, and the most common interaction with locals is a Hawaiian hand salute that means \"hang loose\". </p> <p>In a briefing after the shooting of the two boys, Col Sellers insisted the rules of engagement had been followed in the \"tragic accident\". But admitted it was a big setback to building relations with the already-suspicious local community. </p> <p>On Sunday morning Abdul Nabi, the boys' father, sat nursing his surviving son at Kandahar military hospital. </p> <p>\"How can this be a mistake?\" he asked, holding Ali's wounded leg in his hand. \"A mistake is shooting one person. Not two ... If they are shooting our children how can we be their friends?\"</p>",
  "Hasn't it been good being back in Bournemouth? <p>Now Liberal Democrat-run Bournemouth.</p> <p>Already local people are seeing the benefits - a deal to refurbish this conference centre, vital to the tourist economy. A big increase in recycling.</p> <p>Such Liberal Democrat success is the clearest sign Andrew Garratt can be the next MP for Bournemouth East. One of many Conservative seats in our sights. </p> <p>Too often we forget it's local government success that's brought this party parliamentary success.</p> <p>So can I thank all the local campaigners for your fabulous efforts in the council elections in June - and indeed the elections in May 2003.</p> <p>Because of you, we go into the next General Election as the only party able to unite Britain. Liberal Democrats taking on Labour in the cities, Liberal Democrats challenging Conservatives in the country. We are the only \"One Nation\" party now.</p> <p>So we need to be ambitious today - more ambitious for Britain - with our message of Freedom, Fairness and Trust.</p> <p>I believe our Local Government policies prove our commitment to these ideas.</p> <p>We want freedom - freedom from the bossy, Whitehall knows best Labour Government.</p> <p>We want fairness - fairness in local taxation.</p> <p>And we want to restore trust in politics - replacing unelected, distant bureaucrats, with locally accountable, elected representatives.</p> <p>Let's start with freedom. Freedom requires diversity. It needs debate. Pluralism. It needs strong local democracy.</p> <p>Yet in Britain, our people have been stifled by central controls, regulations and Whitehall targets. Britain has the most centralised state of any major western democracy.</p> <p>And whether it's Labour or Conservative, they both want to keep central Treasury control over every local council's budget.</p> <p>Whether it's Howard or Blair, they both think the man in Whitehall knows best how to run our local schools. </p> <p>Fellow Liberal Democrats, the fight is now for the future of local democracy, and our historic political freedoms.</p> <p>If central Government continues to take on ever more power - over education, over police, with compulsory identity cards, abolishing jury trial - what sort of state will we be in?</p> <p>We're now twenty years on from 1984. But, unlike George Orwell, Labour's produced two Big Brothers: Big Brother Blair and Big Brother Brown - the Cain and Abel of the Cabinet.</p> <p>So it's time for a new reality TV show. Political Big Brother. Where we could watch the Cabinet, rather than the Cabinet watching us.</p> <p>Imagine the scene. The tension between the contestants of Political Big Brother. Gordon and Tony vying to become the new Nadia.</p> <p>Imagine a trip by Gordon to the diary room, where he speaks his private thoughts.</p> <p>\"It's not fair. Tony makes all these promises. And just doesn't keep them. He's got a new friend now - from America.\"</p> <p>The TV audience would see the reality of New Labour - and then vote them out!</p> <p>In George Orwell's novel, the Government spoke in \"News Speak\". These Big Brothers have their own version - \"New Spin\".</p> <p>In local government, Labour keeps spinning about \"new localism\".</p> <p>You'd think this means councils getting new freedoms, to do the job people elected them for. Yet the reality is less freedom, as Big Brother Brown caps and ring-fences council budgets.</p> <p>Colleagues, when Labour puts the adjective \"new\" in front of anything, beware.</p> <p>In Labour's Big Brother NewSpin, \"new\" means \"not\".</p> <p>New freedom. Not freedom.</p> <p>New localism. Not localism.</p> <p>New Labour. Not likely.</p> <p>However, after the last local elections, there's one \"new\" that Labour won't talk about. </p> <p>New - castle.</p> <p>Stand up the new leader of Newcastle City Council, Peter Arnold.</p> <p>Congratulations. You've shown that Liberal Democrats can beat Tony Blair in his North East backyard. Next stop Hartlepool.</p> <p>One time Labour fortresses like Newcastle. Durham. Liverpool. York. Islington. Lambeth. Southwark. Leeds and Cardiff - all now flying the flag of Liberal Democracy.</p> <p>That's the foundation for more Parliamentary success - and for more political freedom.</p> <p>And more fairness. By scrapping council tax.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>Because unlike the right, we don't believe tax is bad....</p> <p>And unlike the left, we don't believe tax is good....</p> <p>We believe tax is necessary, and when it's necessary, it must be fair.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat alternative to council tax - a local income tax - is based on the principle of fairness. The ability to pay.</p> <p>This will be a major tax cut - delivered by Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>A tax cut for families on modest incomes.</p> <p>A tax cut for pensioners.</p> <p>And for the majority of households.</p> <p>Our plans mean nearly 9 out of 10 pensioners will gain.</p> <p>Over half of pensioners will end up paying no local tax at all.</p> <p>Pensioners deserve a fairer deal.</p> <p>They are the generation that worked and sacrificed and paid their taxes to set up our National Health Service.</p> <p>They're the generation that bequeathed us a country we love and are proud of.</p> <p>We owe them.</p> <p>Let's face it, we'll all be old one day. Will your pension protect you from rising council tax?</p> <p>It can't be fair that the average council tax bill has risen by over 70% since 97 - while pensions and low incomes have only just kept pace with inflation.</p> <p>And it set to get worse. Big Brother Brown is going to revalue the council tax paid on our homes - and for that \"Big Brother\" the only way is up with unfair tax. Some people could see their bills double or treble under Labour's plans for council tax.</p> <p>What a ticking timebomb. Labour's largest stealth tax rise ever - but after the next election, of course. </p> <p>So let's keep campaigning to Axe the Tax.</p> <p>So a teacher can gain over \u00a3200 a year.</p> <p>The average household - on average income - gaining over \u00a3450 a year.</p> <p>A policeman married to a nurse, with a combined income of just under \u00a340,000 still gaining.</p> <p>A pensioner couple, not eligible for council tax benefit, could gain over \u00a31,000.</p> <p>But, I have to tell you, it's not all good news. MPs like me would pay more under local income tax.</p> <p>And a poor old Cabinet Minister would lose even more.</p> <p>Not a wet eye in the House.</p> <p>And as we present our positive policy, remember the Tories' role in all this. For the unfair council tax is a Tory tax. And Conservatives, like Labour, have no plans to change it.</p> <p>Now I'm not saying Michael Howard is always wrong - he's not that consistent.</p> <p>Michael Howard flip flops on every serious issue - he's for the war but would vote against it; he's for lower tax and higher spending. He championed the poll tax. Then thought up the council tax. </p> <p>With Michael Howard's leadership you see the scientific miracle of evolution hurtling backwards. John Redwood.</p> <p>Howard's end will come because politicians who are all things to everybody become nothing to anybody.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats have set out a clear alternative to Labour. </p> <p>Charles Kennedy has rightly said the political battle is no longer between ideas of the left and the right - but between the ideas of liberals and authoritarians.</p> <p>Liberals promoting the politics of hope, the authoritarians peddling the politics of fear.</p> <p>And I believe you can tell whether a politician is for hope or fear by how they answer the great Gladstonian test: do you trust the people?</p> <p>Because, if we want people to rebuild their trust in politics, then politicians have to be trustworthy - trustworthy to deliver on their promises.</p> <p>Not deceiving people - about weapons of mass destruction, about House of Lords reform, about student tuition fees.</p> <p>To regain trust, politicians have to do what they promised to do - as Liberal Democrats did in Scotland over free care for the elderly and abolishing student fees.</p> <p>The campaign for more democracy in England's regions is also about trust - and whether politicians trust the people.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats support a \"yes\" vote in November's North East referendum, because we trust the people of the North East.</p> <p>We want to free people from the Whitehall bureaucracy.</p> <p>In the North East region alone, there are over 170 quangos.</p> <p>Like \"Don't Choke Britain: north east planning group.\" Or Culture North East. And the Northern Arts Advisers Panel. Or the Regional Foresight Steering Committee - which presumably doesn't need an agenda!</p> <p>Quango after quango, with not a single directly accountable politician.</p> <p>A \"Yes\" vote, is the only way to start to sweep this aside this and put people in charge.</p> <p>But, once again, New Labour stuttered, when they needed to be bold. Allowing John Prescott to fumble the case for regional democracy.</p> <p>But we must still win that vote. We must rescue the \"Yes\" campaign, to show it's about trusting the people of the North East, not about Labour.</p> <p>Successful Liberal Democrat councils instinctively put trusting the people at the top of their agendas.</p> <p>Take Liverpool. Look how Liberal Democrats there have turned round that city, by involving local people in regenerating their own communities.</p> <p>Take Islington. Steve Hitchens' team is turning round Labour's past failure, working with the people.</p> <p>They've led the way nationally, in beating anti-social behaviour, with their ABCs - Acceptable Behaviour Contracts. Liberal Democrats in local government inventing the most successful measure to fight anti-social behaviour Britain now has.</p> <p>Go to Eastleigh, where Liberal Democrats have worked with the public to massively increase recycling.</p> <p>Such Liberal Democrat-run councils win, because they build trust and share their local people's ambitions.</p> <p>And, colleagues, we must now rebuild the British people's trust in politics and share our ambitions with the whole country.</p> <p>For with most of urban Britain, a Tory-free zone, only Liberal Democrats can defeat Labour. In much of Britain next time, a Tory vote will be a wasted vote.</p> <p>Not one single Tory councillor in Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester, Durham, Oxford, Gateshead.</p> <p>Remember when the Tory Party Chairman, Liam Fox, said Brent East wasn't natural Tory territory?</p> <p>We should have a new letter writing campaign to Chairman Fox - let's call it \"the last Fox Hunt\".</p> <p>Let's ask him, which cities remain natural Tory territory.</p> <p>Leicester South? Birmingham Hodge Hill? Hartlepool?</p> <p>Well, Liberal Democrats have our own cunning fox who knows the answers - the Rennard. Labour and Tories would both like to ban Chris!</p> <p>Colleagues, we have a daunting challenge.</p> <p>This Government has lost its way.</p> <p>If Labour was still capable of listening, they'd have heard the call to scrap council tax.</p> <p>If this Government was still capable of trusting, they'd have trusted the Audit Commission's finding that the council tax system is flawed.</p> <p>If this Government was still capable of responding to the people's needs, they wouldn't be losing key North East councils like Newcastle.</p> <p>So we must be ambitious for our message of Freedom, Fairness and Trust.</p> <p>Ambitious for political freedom, to save local democracy.</p> <p>Ambitious for fairness, to scrap the unfair council tax.</p> <p>And ambitious for trust, to rebuild decent, honest politics in Britain.</p> <p>It was Jo Grimond who said he would march us, his Liberal troops, towards the sound of gunfire.</p> <p>Well, Charles Kennedy has led us much, much further.</p> <p>And we can now see the whites of their eyes.</p> <p>Colleagues, the electoral battle is upon us. If we set our sights high, a Liberal Britain is within our grasp.</p>",
  "<p>As he gears up for Labour's Brighton conference and the coming election campaign after another bruising year, David Blunkett is in fighting form, even by his own pugnacious standards. He likens himself to a frigate protecting Tony Blair's precious convoy of MPs seeking re-election.</p> <p>On the need to stand firm against terrorism in Iraq, he admits that \"it has divided the country, families and the Labour party. When I sit down to eat with friends, they disagree with me.\" </p> <p>But Mr Blair is an Iraq faintheart in comparison with his home secretary. The enemy \"are against everything we stand for and, were they to win, they would come for us - not with weapons of mass destruction, but with suicide bombers, with ricin and with the kind of weaponry al-Qaida use,\" Mr Blunkett will tell next week's party conference. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett says that things are getting better in Britain, but that many people cannot see it. He cites the revival of community spirit and activity in his working-class constituency of Sheffield Brightside; partly due to Labour's regeneration programmes, partly to growing self-confidence among people that they can make a difference. </p> <p>\"Iraq is the cloud that has resulted in people raising their umbrellas,\" he says. \"And when you have an umbrella over your head, it is sometimes difficult to feel the sun coming through. So we do need to address that domestic agenda, and I think you will find the prime minister will do just that next Tuesday in Brighton\". </p> <p>At the end of his interview on the red sofas in his office high above St James's Park, Mr Blunkett declares himself \"full of vitality, energy and drive.\" </p> <p>\"In the general election, I am going to be the frigate that takes the Tory fire - now they have gone back into their ideological bunker and concentrated on my area of work - so that the convoy forges on to victory. I am very happy to do that,\" he says. </p> <p>For a self-styled law-and-order populist who loves nothing better than to tease what he calls \"the liberal left\" intelligentsia (the people who never give a Labour government the benefit of the doubt, he says), Mr Blunkett describes himself as being tough in order to deliver \"good progressive things.\" </p> <p>\"I am the first home secretary in 100 years who has been able to sort out out sexual offences laws,\" Mr Blunkett says. </p> <p>Though he does not spell it out, he is referring to the divisive national trauma that followed Oscar Wilde's conviction and imprisonment in 1895, and which frightened politicians off reform for decades. It is a bold claim for an MP who initially voted against equalisation of the age of consent, but one made with characteristic conviction. </p> <p>And while he is on the subject, did he not this week release \"D\", the Algerian terrorist suspect held for two years? </p> <p>\"You don't want people incarcerated for ever, and you should review the evidence ... As for whether he should be removed [from Britain], I have taken the view that it would be wrong to return people to certain death. I wouldn't mind a bit of acknowledgement from the liberal left on that, either.\"</p> <p>The declared purpose of Mr Blunkett's interview is to emphasise that \"there has to be a third-term vision that does not simply say, 'This is what we have done. Give us a third term.' There has to be a vision of another kind of politics\" - one which Mr Blair, Mr Brown and he can all work towards. </p> <p>The key word in Mr Blunkett's analysis is security: what people need if they are to \"overcome alienation and disengagement. That's quite a challenge. People are disengaged because the world has changed so rapidly ... that change causes greater insecurity and fearfulness, which reinforces alienation from both the process of politics and from coping with change.\" </p> <p>He sees the need for a three-stranded narrative, to link the economic security that Mr Brown has been sustaining, neighbourhood security (a mixture of revived community empowerment and tough anti-crime measures), and the global security that Mr Blair is battling to develop. </p> <p>He argues forcefully that the terrorist threat has raised \"subliminal fears\" among voters that they are less secure; and that a combination of the global information network and the universality of English have made people fear a flood of migrants. </p> <p>By allowing citizens of new eastern European EU member states to openly \"register, work and pay taxes\" - instead of working clandestinely, as in most EU countries - Mr Blunkett claims to have disproved such predictions of a \"flood\". </p> <p>\"I had to hold my nerve in April because the media pressures were enormous. I am never going to satisfy the rightwing zealots,\" he says. But he also regrets that there are some people \"never reflecting whether they were right or wrong, who never go back and say, 'Was what we said at the time a load of garbage?'\" </p> <p>At moments like this, Mr Blunkett's angrier side emerges. It is clear that personal attacks hurt, and he protects his private life and private feelings very closely. They are not up for discussion in any form, though when an aide removes a curious wooden statue which will otherwise stick out of the home secretary's head in Dan Chung's photograph, he thanks him. \"I can do without any phallic symbols.\" </p> <p>But his optimism soon reasserts itself. When MPs actually discuss the details of anti-terrorist legislation, they always have a \"sensible thoughtful debate\" which goes unreported, he says. </p> <p>In one extraordinary comparison, he likens his inability to answer criticism over the terms of terror suspects' detention to the silence enforced on the Labour prime minister Clement Attlee after he and his inner cabinet secretly sanctioned the building of a British hydrogen bomb in the late 40s. </p> <p>\"I have to live with that, just as, when Churchill accused Attlee of not engaging with the H-bomb, Attlee was not able to say before the 1951 election, 'We are doing it.'\" </p> <p>It is not a comparison that will cheer all Labour veterans.</p>",
  "<p>They are genuinely asking, genuinely puzzled: at the Liberal Democrat fringe meetings and late-night parties in Bournemouth this week, Charlie Kennedy-supporting activists and MPs have been asking why fed-up Labour supporters don't do the obvious and simply switch to them. If you really find Tony Blair too right-wing, hated the Iraq war and want more progressive policies on tax and spending, they say, why not follow the logic of your own position? </p> <p>Not only do they have a strong point, many of them are people whom most Labourites would find instantly congenial. There's Shirley Williams, a heroine of mine since the 1970s, arguing with her brilliant combination of common sense and passion. In another corner there's the sharp, friendly and progressive Susan Kramer, likely to become the next MP for Richmond Park. At a packed fringe meeting, Menzies Campbell entertains for over an hour with reflections on his life - in sport and politics - proving himself as intelligent and decent a politician as you'll find in the Commons. And at a Guardian party, as a juice-sipping Charles Kennedy (\"all this Champagne Charlie nonsense - I've always loathed the stuff\") moves through the throng, the policy wonks and strategists around him seem very similar to their Labour rivals ... except, of course, that they're a bit to the left. </p> <p>It is becoming a party where many Labour activists could feel at home. Not only are Lib Dems personally decent, having sloughed off the weirdness and wackiness of the old days. But they have produced a pre-manifesto that ticks many of the right boxes - truly, at first sight, a progressives' wish list. </p> <p>Their emphasis on some of the most vulnerable groups is impressive: the promise of a pension rise for the over-75s; free personal care for the elderly and disabled; an end to university fees, tuition or top-up; a tax hike on people earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year, which strikes me as fair; and the introduction of local income tax (ditto). Overall, though they still don't say how they would pay for their promises to the elderly beyond the immediate term, the effect would be strongly redistributive, as much between age as class groups. </p> <p>Even more important, they seem to be taking the environment seriously, as Labour traditionally never has. Higher taxes on gas-guzzling cars, including those gross \"Chelsea tractors\" - the belching 4x4s that hog London streets - are particularly welcome, but their moves on air travel are potentially more radical. It won't be popular to stop the cheap flights bonanza, but it is environmental suicide not to try. If only Labour would take note. </p> <p>Then, inevitably, comes Iraq. Kennedy did not lead the kind of anti-war crusade around the country that earlier Liberals might have done - no whiff of Gladstone's Midlothian campaign rhetoric or Lloyd George in full withering flow. He was excessively cautious and pulled his punches at key moments in the Commons in ways that made some of us shout at the telly. Still, he stood out bravely against the Bush-led regime change folly and he was an early, shrewd critic of the lack of post-war planning. Having endured mockery and antagonism in equal measure in the Commons chamber, Kennedy has been proved right, and has earned the right to keep challenging Blair on trust. </p> <p>So far, so good. And yet, watching the debates in the sparsely attended conference hall in Bournemouth, I can't help thinking that it's more than simple tribalism that stops me supporting the Lib Dems. For a start, the well-worn formula that they are neither right nor left, just forward, doesn't wash. Earlier in the week, they claimed to be jubilant when the Mirror described them as \"Orange Tories\", while the Sun claimed they were jolting to the left. Far from having outsmarted their opponents as the Lib Dems claim, it looks to me as if they are simply confused. </p> <p>The anger sparked by the Orange Book - a collection of policy proposals including a scheme for national health insurance - demonstrates rabid disagreement about whether the Lib Dems should be a party of hard-edged economic liberals or more traditional social democratic types. Why should Labour people, however cross we feel, now help to destroy the Labour party - which, with all its faults, is on the centre left - in favour of a one-off bundle of policy ideas and a group of politicians who don't quite hang together ideologically? Do we really trust Vincent Cable and David Laws as the shapers of Britain's progressive future? </p> <p>Second, though the Lib Dems make all the right noises about fairness and equality, their real commitment remains dubious. Equal pay, work-life balance and affordable childcare are shooting to the top of Labour's agenda, driven by the substantial number of strong Labour women MPs. The Lib Dems have little to say about all this, and refuse to adopt any effective measures to boost their pitiful number of women MPs - just 11% of the total. Of their top 30 target seats, less than 25% have selected women candidates. Yet Matthew Taylor, their chair, suggests the sole reason for this is that there aren't enough women out there who would like to do the job. </p> <p>But above all, the Lib Dems need a severe, jolting reality check. Barring a cataclysmic political upset, a vote for them remains a protest vote. They remain far below Labour in the polls, despite the war, tuition fees and all the rest. Labour retains strong ties to hundreds of thousands of progressive working-class and middle-class people through the union link. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are political operators at a different level of thinking and experience than anyone in the Lib Dem fold. </p> <p>New Labour has delivered economic stability, the minimum wage, a major redistribution in favour of poorer working families, constitutional reforms and real improvements in health and education. For a party that has never held power at Westminster and indulges in all sorts of unlikely cohabitations to hold local power, to simply dismiss this as failure isn't just impertinent. It's actually funny. </p> <p>And, while those of us fed up with some aspects of Blair's leadership do applaud individual Lib Dem policies, and would even like to see them taken up by ministers, we also know that the Labour party is not simply Tony's party. It is a broad coalition. It is full of talented, progressive politicians who also want a leftish turn, and whose time will come - much more certainly than the time of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>So it is reality, not accusations of hypocrisy, that keeps me outside the Lib Dem camp. Far better a share of real power today than a dream. </p> <p>Like many, I have a residual doubt about where the Lib Dems might end up; I know their opportunism in the past and that they are bidding keenly for Tory votes. So when they say they want centre-left support but sneer at the very phrase \"centre-left\", it is hardly surprising they engender suspicion. My Lib Dem friends, you have some good policies and some good people. But you cannot simultaneously look down your noses and hold out your hands. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: The Lib Dems' party conference, John Kerry in fighting mood and Cat Stevens as terror threat</p> <p><b>'MR BLAIR, I DON'T WANT TO DIE'</b></p> <p>For once, all the main morning newspapers lead with the same story and, in many cases, the same headline. A video appeal from British hostage Kenneth Bigley to Tony Blair was last night posted on an Islamist website. \"I need you to help me now, Mr Blair, because you are the only person on God's earth who can,\" reads the Times headline, quoting Mr Bigley verbatim.</p> <p>The Guardian places Mr Bigley's words against a fuzzy image of him from the video in which he is wearing an orange jumpsuit. The paper said he \"appeared composed, but there was desperation in his voice\".</p> <p>An announcement from the Iraqi government yesterday that at least one prominent female prisoner, Rihab Taha, a biological weapons scientist, would be released was countermanded by the US, which is holding her, and appears to have shut off Mr Bigley's one glimmer of hope.</p> <p>The Telegraph's report suggests the video was an attempt to drive a wedge between Britain and the US, and between the coalition and the Iraqi interim government. Its leader column argues there should be no surrender to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the group holding Mr Bigley and, it is believed, the man who personally beheaded his two fellow US captives.</p> <p>\"It is not easy for the prime minister to tell the country that he is powerless to save the life of a British hostage,\" the paper says. \"That, alas, is the case [...] it would be cruel as well as false for him to imply that anything he might do or say could have the least influence on the closed minds of the terrorists.\"</p> <p>The Financial Times says that the \"grim horror\" of the daily news from Iraq will frustrate Mr Blair's attempts to focus on a domestic agenda at next week's Labour party conference, and the Independent adds that Labour's private polling suggests Mr Blair's Iraq policy could cost it 3m votes at the next general election. Seamus Milne, writing in the Guardian's comment pages, suggests that Labour should use its conference to vote for a troop withdrawal \"to begin to undo the damage to itself and lay the ground for change in Iraq [...] It is now clear that there will be no security in Iraq while US and British forces remain.\"</p> <p>The Times adds that another Islamist group last night claimed the murder of two Italian aid workers, Simona Toretta and Simona Pari. If the statement is correct they are the first foreign female hostages to be killed in Iraq.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1310807,00.html\">'Mr Blair, I don't want to die\"</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1310804,00.html\">Labour must dare to speak for Britain - and Iraq</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/23/dl2301.xml\">Telegraph: No surrender to al-Zarqawi</a><br>* <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/f007164a-0cfc-11d9-b543-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Kidnapping ensures Blair focuses on Iraq</a><br>* <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=564726\">Independent: Blair's Iraq 'fixation' is costing Labour votes</a><br>* <a href=\"http://search.thetimes.co.uk/cgi-bin/ezk2srch?-aSTART#\">Times: 'Help me now, Mr Blair'</a></p> <p><b>SOMETHING OF THE RIGHT</b></p> <p>Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, today addresses his party conference with a pledge to take on the Tories, according to the preview reports of his speech. What the Tories will make of this is anyone's guess, but there are still strong indications the rivals they fear most are the UK Independence party. The Mirror finds strong similarities between Mr Howard's speech yesterday on immigration and asylum - he wants to pull out of the UN convention on human rights, and set an upper limit on immigration - to one made a few weeks ago by the UKIP MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk.

The Sun explains all this by way of the headline: Put the Cat out.</p> <p>A Telegraph profile meanwhile explains how Stevens found God while being carried out to sea while swimming off Malibu.

  "Sweeping counter-terrorism laws were debated in the Russian parliament yesterday, including proposals that would allow the country to declare itself at war and impose tight restrictions on travel and the media. <p>Under the plans, Russian television and radio journalists would not be allowed to report on a siege until the situation had been resolved. </p> <p>The measures are part of a package debated by the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, which has been tasked with drawing up a new anti-terror bill in the wake of the Beslan massacre. </p> <p>Two-thirds of the Duma's MPs are members of the United Russia party, which supports the president, Vladimir Putin. This has led some analysts to worry that many of the proposed changes are not related to terrorism, but are part of a Kremlin effort to exert more central control. </p> <p>It will take months for parliament to receive Kremlin approval for and finalise some of the many and far-reaching laws proposed yesterday. </p> <p>According to MPs familiar with the drafts and Russian media reports, the planned laws could give the Kremlin the right to declare a \"state of war\" in the event of \"a terrorist action representing a threat to national security\". </p> <p>At present, a state of war, which rescinds many basic civil rights, can be declared only in response to an armed invasion by another country. </p> <p>Another proposed law, suggested by the pro-Putin nationalist Rodina party, would ban broadcast coverage of a hostage crisis until after the captives had been freed. </p> <p>A Rodina MP, Alexander Krutov, said: \"This is to avoid the severe psychological impact that terrorist acts have on the population - one of their main aims.\" </p> <p>He said terrorists gained valuable information from the media during sieges, even helping them to escape. </p> <p>The media have also been the target of comments by the FSB security chief, Nikolai Patrushev, a key confidant of Mr Putin. </p> <p>\"To fight terrorism, the state needs a comprehensive system of measures covering all branches of power: legislative, executive and judicial, and, of course, the mass media,\" he told reporters this week. </p> <p>He has also said that the image of police informers and agents needs to be revamped. </p> <p>New laws are also being drafted on \"free movement ... and registration rules\". </p> <p>At present, Russians and foreigners have to be registered at a particular address, and re-registered if they move. Some MPs want to tighten the restrictions, limiting internal migration, and allowing police to search someone's home during a routine document check. </p> <p>Greater restrictions are also being considered on the purchase of travel tickets. The suicide bombers who brought down two airliners last month bought tickets with minimal documents at the last minute. A vaguely worded resolution passed last night said that \"if necessary, special passport, visa and registration measures must be introduced in individual regions\". </p> <p>Stricter punishments for terrorists are also being drafted, although yesterday the parliament rejected one of the harsher proposals - to lift the moratorium on the death penalty. </p> <p>Measures being considered include the confiscation of property belonging to a terrorist's family, and the criminalisation of the failure to inform the authorities about a terrorist act. </p> <p>A source in the Duma said it was possible the legislation would include a revamp of the special military forces. </p> <p>Vladimir Pribylovsky, the head of the Panorama thinktank, said the terrorism laws were \"simply a pretext to realise the reforms that the president and his inner circle have conceived years ago\". </p> <p>Masha Lipman from the Carnegie Centre in Moscow said the Kremlim usually allowed a series of extreme measures to be floated by \"faceless MPs\" so they could \"probe and try\" them on public opinion. </p> <p>\"This is the case with the idea to lift the death penalty moratorium. They get to knock it down and look enlightened, liberal and as if they belong in Europe.\"</p>",
  "<p>ITV pushed on with its disposal programme yesterday by selling its stake in French technology group Thomson in a deal that will reduce its debt by \u00a3172m. </p> <p>The 5.5% shareholding was inherited by ITV following the merger of Granada and Carlton earlier this year. The broadcaster sold its 15.5m shares to investment banks Citigroup and UBS and the proceeds will be used to cut net debt from \u00a3571m to \u00a3399m. </p> <p>The stake sale follows the disposal of ITV's Carlton Books operation in a management buyout last month as the clearout of non-core businesses began. The group has received initial bids for its spe cial-effects subsidiary, the Moving Picture Company, with the transaction expected to raise between \u00a350m and \u00a360m. It is understood that Michael Green, the former Carlton chairman, and advertising group WPP are not in the running for MPC despite initial interest. </p> <p>Charles Allen, the chief executive of ITV, said the disposal process was \"well-advanced\" following the Thomson deal. </p> <p>\"We're delighted to have disposed of our largest non-core asset sooner than expected, at a five-month high, and reduced our borrowings by \u00a3172m. This disposal, together with the recent sale of Carlton Books and the initial bids we've received for the Moving Picture Company, means that we are well advanced in disposing of our non-core assets, restructuring our balance sheet and significantly reducing our debt.\" </p> <p>ITV is conducting a review of its non-core holdings but it is expected to seek buyers for stakes in Arsenal and Liverpool football clubs and a shareholding in Australian broadcaster Seven Network. </p> <p>The wholly owned Granada Learning and Carlton Screen Advertising are also poised for disposal but it is understood that a stake in cinema chain Village Roadshow will be retained. </p> <p>Earlier this month Mr Allen said stakes in SMG - owner of two ITV franchises in Scotland - GMTV, ITN and Ireland's TV3 would not be sold. Analysts expect ITV to take full control of GMTV and SMG over time as it picks up the remaining independent licences within the ITV network. </p> <p>Bidders for MPC have been invited to conduct due diligence, and ITV hopes to close a deal by the end of next month. MPC is expected to post earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of \u00a39m next year, up from \u00a36m this year - although analysts cautioned it could require considerable investment from the buyer. </p> <p>\"It's a business that is capital-intensive. If it has been under-invested in for a number of years it could require a lot of investment,\" said Anthony de Larrinaga, a sector analyst at SGs Securities.</p>",
  "<p>Despite dark forecasts that ITV will lose \u00a3114m in advertising revenue next year under new airtime trading rules, an industry study predicts the loss will be less than \u00a330m. </p> <p>The largest terrestrial network has been dogged by reports that its share of the television advertising market - worth \u00a31.6bn annually - will be slashed after its disappointing ratings this year. It has become a pressing issue for ITV executives because negotiations for next year's advertising contracts start in October. </p> <p>Research by media agency the Allmond Partnership, however, indicates that ITV will rein in potential losses with a new approach, including the aggressive selling of airtime on its digital channels and stricter enforcement of contracts. </p> <p>\"Our view is that while mathematically you could make a claim for bigger losses, the reality of the way the TV market trades means that advertising buyers will not want to reduce the proportion of their ITV budgets so dramatically,\" says Paul Longhurst, managing director of the Allmond Partnership. </p> <p>The birth of a single ITV this year was hailed as the saviour of a network hobbled by mismanagement and an awkward federal structure. But the merger of Granada and Carlton, the largest companies in the ITV network, contained a sting in the tail, it emerged, after a Competition Commission investigation recommended restrictions on the way ITV sells advertising. </p> <p>ITV subsequently signed up to an advertising trading system known as \"contract rights renewal\" to assuage concerns that the merger of the ITV heavyweights, who together control 51% of the TV advertising market, would allow the network to ratchet up the cost of ad slots. </p> <p>The contract rights renewal remedy allows advertisers and the media buying agencies who book slots on their behalf to roll over contracts they signed with ITV last year into 2004, 2005 and 2006. </p> <p>Airtime contracts normally take the form of \"share deals\" whereby companies such as Dixons or Coca-Cola commit a percentage of their TV advertising budget for that year to ITV. Depending on the size of their commitment, advertisers are also given a discount on the price of ad slots. That price is calculated by dividing the amount of advertising cash invested in a channel every month by the viewing total for that month. The number of viewers, or \"impacts\", is a key currency for these deals. Impacts are divided into certain demographics, with 16 to 34-year-olds representing a highly sought-after audience. </p> <p>A fall in audience ratings, and therefore a fall in impacts, is potentially a costly business for ITV under the terms of contract rights renewal. Media buyers and advertisers can reduce the budget share they spend with ITV in line with the fall in impacts - without damaging the basic terms of their 2003 share deal. The brutal logic of contract rights renewal is that a 10% fall in ITV1 audience ratings can result in a 10% drop in advertising revenue. </p> <p>ITV executives have watched ITV1's underperforming audience figures this year with some concern. Next year's advertising contracts will be based on 2004 audience figures, and in the nine months to September ITV1's share of total commercial impacts is down 6.8%, according to the Allmond Partnership. If that dip continues for the rest of the year, total advertising revenue coming into the network can theoretically fall by the same amount. A fall of 6.8% will shave \u00a3113.9m off ITV's advertising turnover. </p> <p>This equation has unnerved the City, to the irritation of ITV executives, who are adamant contract rights renewal will not punish the network to that extent. They argue autumn is traditionally a strong period for the broadcaster and the next three months will claw back much of the looming viewer deficit: I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Foyle's War all return later this year. </p> <p>\"If we can have a strong three months where we demonstrate that the level of decline has stopped and we are holding our audience performance then advertisers are more likely to believe our promises on the market they are buying into next year,\" says Mick Desmond, head of ITV Broadcasting. </p> <p>But the guessing game over ITV's audience share could be irrelevant. There is little chance of ITV's highly incentivised sales team letting \u00a3114m escape its grasp, the Allmond Partnership says. Contract rights renewal applies to ITV1 only, which allows the network to push digital channels ITV2 and the soon-to-be-launched ITV3. The media buyer estimates that multichannel TV will help ITV pull back about \u00a340m of the potential loss next year. </p> <p>The small print of advertising contracts is another incentive. ITV and others set an eight-week advance booking deadline for slots and charge a premium for ads booked after that date. The network has turned a blind eye to enforcing that clause in the past but it could be wielded in the future, particularly with clients who have taken advantage of a drop in audience figures and adjusted their contracts accordingly. </p> <p>The new trading system also encourages ITV to sweat its airtime harder, the study says. Justin Sampson joined ITV from the Radio Advertising Bureau this year with the brief of smoothing relations with advertisers, which includes listening to demands for better use of ad spots. \"There needs to be more management of slotting airtime efficiently against the different target markets it delivers, and potentially more revenue can be taken from programme sponsorship,\" says Mr Longhurst. </p> <p>If the above factors are taken into account, the headline loss of \u00a3114m is an unrealistic figure, Mr Longhurst argues. ITV will work hard over the coming months to ensure no money is lost at all, but a shortfall of \u00a330m is possible. </p> <p>Adrian Carpenter, broadcast director at the Allmond Partnership, which trades with ITV, believes contract rights renewal will spark changes in the relationship between broadcasters, media buyers and advertising clients that will go beyond ITV's short-term concerns over a \u00a3100m revenue deficit. </p> <p>\"It will be a change of culture and hopefully a change of how our TV marketplace works. This is the beginning of that process,\" he says.</p>",
  "When President George Bush addressed the general assembly in September 2002, he told the United Nations it was in danger of becoming \"irrelevant\" unless it confronted Iraq. It didn't, and it isn't. Two years later, and the UN's continuing relevancy was confirmed by a more restrained Mr Bush on Tuesday. As the Los Angeles Times put it, Mr Bush \"didn't quite break out in Esperanto\" at UN headquarters, but he did take a much more diplomatic approach than his earlier appearance. He was careful to heap praise on the work of UN personnel on the ground in Iraq, as well as on Nato for helping to train Iraqi troops. <p>Naturally, with more than an eye on the looming presidential election, Mr Bush's speech was studded with references to his administration's perceived successes. But there was still no hint from Mr Bush that the US's attempts to bully the UN into supporting an invasion of Iraq - by exaggerating and embellishing the existence of weapons of mass destruction - deserved an explanation or apology. His claim that fighting in Iraq means \"peaceful nations will never have to face [terrorists] within our own borders\" will sound savagely hollow to the people of Spain and Indonesia. Tellingly, Mr Bush's attempt to maintain that the US acted to support UN resolutions was coolly dismissed by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, who told the assembly: \"Those who invoke international law must themselves submit to it.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, Mr Bush's speech contained little of the crude unilateralism that his campaigning exhibits, nor the cheap smears at John Kerry's policy of greater engagement with the international community as a sign of weakness and capitulation. In an interesting twist, while Mr Bush was vainly trying to win friends at the UN, Mr Kerry was continuing his assault on Mr Bush's record in Iraq, which the Democrat challenger branded as \"colossal failures in judgment\". At last, as the drip-drip of bad news from Iraq turns into a torrent, Mr Kerry's decision to tackle Mr Bush head-on over Iraq promises to ignite the presidential campaign in its final weeks. </p> <p>So far, the Bush campaign has been largely successful in entwining the threat of terrorism with Saddam Hussein's regime in the minds of many US voters. Mr Kerry's job is first to separate the two issues, and then hold Mr Bush to account for the series of errors and falsehoods that led towards invasion, and the disastrous lack of planning for administering and rebuilding post-Saddam Iraq. There is a risk that Mr Kerry won't be able to pull it off, and the Bush campaign will again paint him as a \"flip-flopper\". But the tide of bad news is such that Mr Bush's vision of Iraq being rapidly transformed into Texas-on-the-Euphrates is the stuff of fantasy. The more Mr Kerry can press Mr Bush on his record and his inchoate plans for Iraq, the better for his chances, and possibly for the people of Iraq - who may not have a vote but certainly have an interest in the outcome. </p> <p>Another person with an interest in the outcome is Tony Blair, who is now in what management consultants call a \"lose-lose\" position. A Kerry victory based on attacking Mr Bush's mismanagement of Iraq leaves Mr Blair friendless in Washington and open to the same attacks on this side of the Atlantic. But a Bush victory will surely be no better for Mr Blair, since he will remain shackled to his uncomfortable ally, and continue to endure the stream of hostage-taking, civilian deaths and descent into violence that the past few months have seen in Iraq. Mr Bush has given no sense of a meaningful exit strategy, other than the increasingly untenable plans for an election in January. Should Mr Bush be re-elected, the chances are for greater violence in Iraq, not less. This is the worst of all possible worlds for Mr Blair: whoever wins in November, he loses.</p>",
  "The news is grim, but the president is \"optimistic\". The intelligence is sobering, but he tosses aside \"pessimistic predictions\". His opponent says he has \"no credibility\", but the president replies that it is his rival who is \"twisting in the wind\". The UN secretary general speaks of the \"rule of law\", but he talks before a mute general assembly of \"a new definition of security\". Between the rhetoric and the reality lies the campaign. <p>In Iraq, US commanders have plans for this week and the next, but there is \"no overarching strategy\", I was told by a reliable source who has just returned after assessing the facts on the ground for US intelligence services. The New York Times reports that an offensive is in the works to capture the insurgent stronghold of Falluja - after the election. In the meantime, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and other terrorists linked to al-Qaida operate from there at will, as they have for more than a year. The president speaks of new Iraqi security forces, but not even half the US personnel have been assigned to the headquarters of the Multinational Security Transition Command. </p> <p>George Bush's vision of the liberation of Iraq has melted before harsh facts. But reality cannot be allowed to obscure the image. The liberation is \"succeeding\", he insists, and only pessimists cannot see it. </p> <p>In July, the CIA delivered to the president a new national intelligence estimate that detailed three gloomy scenarios for Iraq's future, ranging up to civil war. Perhaps it was his reading of the estimate that prompted Bush to remark in August that the war on terrorism could not be won, a judgment he swiftly reversed. And at the UN, Bush held a press conference where he rebuffed the latest intelligence. </p> <p> Bush explained that, for him, intelligence is not to inform decision-making, but to be used or rejected to advance an ideological and political agenda. His dismissal is an affirmation of the politicisation and corruption of intelligence that rationalised the war. </p> <p>In his stump speech, which he repeats word for word across the country, Bush explains that he invaded Iraq because of \"the lesson of September the 11th\". WMD goes unmentioned; the only reason Bush offers is Saddam Hussein as an agent of terrorism. \"He was a sworn enemy of the United States of America; he had ties to terrorist networks. Do you remember Abu Nidal? He's the guy that killed Leon Klinghoffer. Leon Klinghoffer was murdered because of his religion. Abu Nidal was in Baghdad, as was his organisation.\" </p> <p>The period of Leon Klinghoffer's murder in 1985 on the liner Achille Lauro (by Abu Abbas, in fact) coincided with the US courtship of Saddam, marked by the celebrated visits of then Middle East envoy Donald Rumsfeld. The US collaborated in intelligence exchanges and materially supported Saddam in his war with Iran, authorising the sale of biological agents for Saddam's laboratories, a diversification of his WMD capability. </p> <p>The reason was not born of idealism, but necessity: the threat of an expansive Iran-controlled Shia fundamentalism to the entire Gulf. </p> <p>The policy of courting Saddam continued until he invaded Kuwait. But realpolitik prevailed when US forces held back from capturing Baghdad for larger, geostrategic reasons. The first Bush grasped that in wars to come, the US would need ad hoc coalitions to share the military burden and financial cost. Taking Baghdad would have violated the UN resolution that gave legitimacy to the first Gulf war, as well as creating a nightmare of \"Lebanonisation\", as secretary of state James Baker called it. Realism prevailed; Saddam's power was subdued and drastically reduced. It was the greatest accomplishment of the first President Bush. </p> <p>When he honoured the UN resolution, the credibility of the US in the region was enormously enhanced, enabling serious movement on the Middle East peace process. Now this President Bush has undone the foundation of his father's work, which was built upon by President Clinton. </p> <p>Bush's campaign depends on the containment of any contrary perception of reality. He must evade, deny and suppress it. His true opponent is not his Democratic foe - called unpatriotic and the candidate of al-Qaida by the vice-president - but events. Bush's latest vision is his shield against them. He invokes the power of positive thinking, as taught by Emile Coue, guru of autosuggestion in the giddy 1920s, who urged mental improvement through constant repetition: \"Every day in every way I am getting better and better.\" </p> <p>It was during this era of illusion that TS Eliot wrote The Hollow Men: Between the idea/ And the reality/ Between the motion/ And the act/ Falls the Shadow.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of salon.com </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "The video appeal by Kenneth Bigley last night marked a new level of sophistication from the terrorist organisation led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, which for the first time has attempted to directly influence the domestic audience in Britain. <p>The Islamist jihadists are not normally given to allowing their captives to issue video pleas. The change in procedure may be aimed at demonstrating their power - and the impotence of the government. </p> <p>\"The publicity of the plea and its direct appeal to Tony Blair is much more about the spectacle of intense violence and fear - and highlighting the prime minister's impotence to control the situation - than it is about the realisation of any demands,\" said Toby Dodge, an Iraq expert at Queen Mary College, University of London. \"This is about highlighting the hostages' humiliation and drawing attention to the British government's powerlessness.\" </p> <p>Zarqawi's Tawhid and Jihad group has shown itself adept at using modern technology to broadcast its primitive exploits. Last night, a second video depicted the more usual fare: the beheading of Jack Hensley, one of the two Americans kidnapped along with Mr Bigley. </p> <p>The chief aim of the group appears to be to terrify those working for or alongside the US-led military and to demonstrate that a small group of militants can operate in Iraq in defiance of the presence of 140,000 American troops. </p> <p>\"What the organisation is doing through the use of beheadings, videoing, and websites is deliberately structured to be spectacular and gratuitous,\" said Mr Dodge. \"It's about spreading horror and making Iraq a no-go area for non-Arabs.\" </p> <p>Zarqawi has strung the process out, killing the two Americans, but saving the British hostage to the end. He knows he is unlikely to be able to apply any pressure in America. There the hostage crisis has unfolded very differently. In public, the Bush administration adopted a notably more distanced approach in dealing with the fate of the two US hostages. The men's families did not feature prominently in media reports until after their deaths. </p> <p>Following the death of the first hostage, Eugene Armstrong, Mr Bush told reporters that \"we all stand in solidarity with the American that is now being held hostage.\" But there was little hint of any behind-the-scenes manoeuvring and no reports that senior government figures had met the families. </p> <p>That stands in stark contrast to the European experience. Anyone in Iraq with access to a satellite dish or the internet would know that the capture of the two Italian hostages, both aid workers, has created huge public pressure on the Italian government. The continued detention of the two French journalists is an emotive issue in France. </p> <p>In Britain, the Bigley family appeals have received formidable coverage. And yet there is little the government can do. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the Madrid bombing in March, a theory began to grow that al-Qaida or groups linked to it were attempting to influence the outcome of domestic elections. The governments that supported the war - Australia, Italy, Britain and the US - could all find themselves targeted in the run-up to elections. The recent attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta may not be random. </p> <p>At the very least, the capture of Mr Bigley and his video appeal have pushed Iraq back on to the front pages and top of the television news schedules just as Mr Blair was hoping that he could return to domestic issues and hope the Iraq controversy would begin to fade.</p>",
  "If you want a textbook study of parliament's ability to save a government from its own folly, then look no further than Tessa Jowell's gambling bill. Three years ago, smitten with a deregulatory ideology that had already given us a disastrous licensing law liberalisation, Ms Jowell's culture ministry announced that it intended to rewrite the gambling laws to bring a casino to every high street. There was almost no public demand at all for this revolutionary change in British life. What there was was an eager demand from the gaming industry. Not surprisingly, little real thought was given to the impact on affected towns or to the near certain rise in problem gambling. Last November, Ms Jowell published a draft bill which embodied most of the controversial deregulatory principles that her ministry appeared to have swallowed whole from the 2001 Budd report. <p>Ten months on, the gambling bill looks a very different and much better document. Ms Jowell nowadays talks about her \"precautionary\" approach, and the bill increasingly reflects it. Where there was devil-may-care liberalisation, now there is a cautious, step-by-step approach of controlled deregulation. Where there was indifference and self-delusion about the impact on city centres, there is greater restraint to prevent wholesale change. Where there was insouciance about the impact on vulnerable individuals, now there are pledges to abort further casino plans if social surveys reveal increases in addiction. Yesterday, Ms Jowell strengthened the bill further, in effect banning the gaming industry from building casinos with high stakes slot-machines with prizes as high as \u00a31m in most towns. Anyone who doubts the impact of that decision should note the yelps of dismay from lobbyists yesterday, as well as the fall in gaming share prices. </p> <p>Two things have made the government think again. First, the predictable negative social impact of the culture ministry's previous exercise in industry-driven deregulation - the lamentable licensing act. Second, parliamentary scrutiny. It was April's report from the joint committee of MPs and peers on the draft gambling bill that stopped many of the bill's worst features in their tracks - no less than 139 criticisms that Ms Jowell mostly accepted. It was July's second report from the committee that enabled her to tighten the bill further yesterday. She deserves credit for her willingness to change; if only other cabinet ministers listened as much as she. But it was parliamentary scrutiny that saved her, and us, from disaster. There is a wider lesson for the government there, too.</p>",
  "David Blunkett is planning to lift the blanket ban on the use of covertly obtained intelligence as evidence in court as a means of easing the controversial policy of detaining suspected foreign terrorists indefinitely without trial. <p>In an interview with the Guardian, the home secretary today revealed that he is poised to submit the change to Tony Blair following a six-month joint examination of the issue by the Home Office and the intelligence services.</p> <p>While admitting difficulties remain, including the protection of British and friendly nations' intelligence assets, Mr Blunkett said: \"I am much more won over to the idea of the use of [intelligence] intercepts than I was 12 months ago and believe that it is feasible in certain circumstances.\"</p> <p>The move was cautiously welcomed by Liberty, the civil liberty organisation. A spokesman said that email and other electronic intercepts were such a big part of police and anti-terrorist work that their use in evidence was \"not unreasonable\".</p> <p>He added: \"At the very least the material can be challenged by the defence to test its validity.\"</p> <p>If endorsed by the cabinet, the move would allow more detainees to be tried in open court.</p> <p>This week Mr Blunkett released an Algerian, held at Belmarsh maximum security prison in south-east London for more than two years, because he said his potential risk level - upheld by the courts - was now much lower. \"You don't want people incarcerated for ever and you should review the evidence,\" he said.</p> <p>But the home secretary remains unapologetic about detention without trial because the legislation deliberately set a high threshold for detention.</p> <p>He said that when the Terrorism Act 2000 was passed \"there were predictions that there would be hundreds detained, but in the end I certificated only 17 where [it] was beyond reasonable doubt.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett wants to make a fresh attempt to \"deal with people without putting them in jail\". He is interested in creating a new offence of \"acts preparatory to terrorism\".</p> <p>Details of his reform of the detention laws will await the outcome of a legal challenge in the House of Lords within a fortnight. But Mr Blunkett revealed his change of heart to the long-resisted use of phone taps to obtain convictions.</p> <p>He admitted that the issue was \"technically very challenging\" and that \"you need to wall off some of the international activity that you would never want to use in court\" to protect British and friendly intelligence services and their agents, often in dangerous positions. \"Otherwise, they [the intelligence services] would have to go through the preparatory niceties because we have such very strict rules of evidence. And, if the details did not live up to the rules, then they could never be presented because the evidential base would not be secure enough. You would blow their systems and agents wide open.\"</p> <p>He now believes that anyone found guilty of an association with a terrorist group, or involved in acts preparatory to terrorism should face a civil order that would restrict them having a bank account or from using the internet or computers.</p> <p>\"Such activity could be monitored and if restrictions were breached the individual would be in breach of the criminal law,\" Mr Blunkett said.</p> <p>\"It is about dealing with them without putting them in jail, and not about putting them in jail.\"</p> <p>The concept of acts preparatory to terrorism \"would allow us to get into at a much earlier state what the networks do in supporting terrorism across the world, for example the raising of funds and the ability to organise cells\".</p> <p>He also admitted that the government has failed to convince enough people of the security threat facing the country from Islamic terrorism.</p>",
  "<p>Pigs may never fly, but in the north of England fish are about to start climbing ladders, on a 500-mile network of rivers blocked by weirs since the industrial revolution. </p> <p>Dozens of sites are being considered for fish \"passes\" to allow salmon and newly-stocked populations of barbell, chubb and other coarse fish to return to traditional spawning grounds sealed off for centuries by the mills' demand for power. </p> <p>The move by the Environment Agency is the second stage in a campaign to heal the effects of the age of heavy industry, following a largely successful clean-up of river water. This has had the startling effect in the past five years of reintroducing salmon to many rivers in Yorkshire. </p> <p>\"We want to encourage the opening-up of rivers across the region,\" said Pat O'Brien, head of the agency's fisheries team in Leeds, which is focussing on stretches of the Calder and Aire in some of the 19th century's most heavily-exploited areas. Fish which need to travel up to 25 miles to spawn must traverse weirs as frequently as every half-mile on some stretches, with no way through the curving stone dams. </p> <p>The agency's answer, in co-operation with weir-owners, developers and local authorities, is the \"pass\" or stone ladder, which allows fish to skirt the weirs - and provides a tourist attraction as a by-product. Visitors have been drawn to several successful schemes, including a \u00a376,000 restoration of the 18th century fish pass at Boroughbridge weir on the Ure, where the rare lamprey migrates. </p> <p>Lampreys form part of Yorkshire lore, with thousands of the fish - now protected by law - taken from the Ouse for events such as the Great Feast of Cawood. When rivers were dammed before the 18th century - usually to run corn mills or provide consistently navigable stretches - fish passes were often a condition imposed by the lord of the manor. </p> <p>Their revival by the agency, working with angling and environmental groups and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, is a long-term project because of cost: each weir pass costs an average of \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Mr O'Brien said: \"We have identified 30 major obstructions which need a pass on the Aire alone. Multiply \u00a3250,000 by 30 and tell me how many people in Yorkshire are going to come up straight away with that kind of money.\" </p> <p>But pressure for progress is also considerable, following three years of expensive fish-stocking by the agency. Winter flooding and the regular washing of fish downriver over weirs threatens to deplete the new populations. \"Once a stable population is established, stocking shouldn't be required,\" said Mr O'Brien. \"It makes sense to provide facilities for fish to return to their natural habitats rather than to rely on stocking.\" </p> <p>The agency has warned campaigners for greater free fish passage that its own pot of \"weir money\" is limited, with most of the fees from coarse fishing licences - which cost \u00a323 a year and form 80% of income from anglers - ring-fenced for other improvements. </p> <p>\"We can do a lot as a facilitator,\" said Mr O'Brien, who negotiated space for a future pass at Shipley, where Bradford Rowing Club has just spent \u00a375,000 on repairs to Hirst weir. The club chairman, Hugh Scott, said: \"We didn't have the funds to put a pass in straight away, but we worked with the agency to make sure that there's part of the weir where one can be added when money becomes available.\" </p> <p>The Calder will benefit from a windfall brought by Channel 4's series on the regeneration of Castleford, which has helped attract leading architects to the West Yorkshire town. One of the showpiece projects designed by London firm McDowell and Benedetti is a salmon ladder round the local weir. </p> <p>The agency is also dusting off legal powers which can be used to force improvements to weirs on recognised salmon rivers, although Mr O'Brien and his colleagues are reluctant to see them used. </p> <p>\"It may often be the case that a weir belongs to an old mill or someone who, with the best will in the world, can no longer maintain it. In those circumstances, you need to be practical.\"</p>",
  "George Monbiot is right to assert (Proliferation treaty, September 21) that nuclear weapons can't be phased out without doing the same to that backdoor nuke route, nuclear power. However, even if the IAEA stopped helping countries acquire the potential for making nuclear weapons, a nuclear-free future can only become a reality if there is a credible process that would allow the already nuclear-armed countries to get rid of their weapons. <p>The nuclear nations, weaned as they have been on the deterrence theory, will not come out of this comforting umbrella willingly. However, Jonathan Schell's book The Abolition provides one route for getting rid of nuclear weapons that need not rid the nuclear nations of the \"protection\" they perceive as being provided by deterrence. The infrastructure to remake nuclear weapons would be retained by the nuclear nations, while at the same time the actual production of nuclear weapons ceases and the stockpiles are eliminated. </p> <p>Once this concept is accepted by the nuclear nations and they are seen to be acting on it, this robs any aspiring nuclear nation of its justification for requiring its own nuclear weapons. The final push to ensure international agreement for this process will be the end goal itself, a world free of nuclear weapons and nuclear power stations. This must be constantly compared with the present most likely \"best\" option: minimum nuclear armed deterrence plus nuclear materials from power stations being around forever, with all the disastrous proliferative, environmental and economic threats this entails. <br> <b>Colin Hines</b> <br> East Twickenham, Middx </p> <p>George Monbiot argues that Iran is legally entitled to develop a bomb. This may be so, but merely acting in accordance with the law does not guarantee a moral outcome. He is correct to point out that denying Iran the right to build a nuclear weapon is inconsistent with our tolerance of Israel's nuclear capability, or even our own weapons; but it is none the less better - for everyone, Iran included - if Iran doesn't build a bomb. The proliferation issue is simple: fewer bombs in fewer hands is better than more bombs in more hands. <br> <b>Dr William McIlhagga</b><br> Bradford</p>",
  "<p>A manager for the Giorgio Armani group who was sacked after taking two periods of maternity leave two years apart has won nearly \u00a3112,000 in compensation for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination. </p> <p>The employment appeal tribunal ruled that Sarah Vince Cain, 36, did not have to mitigate her losses by taking another job, but was entitled to go into higher education instead when she was unable to find a job at the same seniority which was flexible enough to accommodate her childcare needs. </p> <p>Mrs Vince-Cain, from Leeds, earned \u00a332,000 plus a bonus as a regional manager for the Armani Group. </p> <p>She initially took maternity leave from December 12 1998 to March 3 1999, and for her second pregnancy from Christmas 2000 to the end of April 2001.

  "I hate to disillusion Mark Seddon (Letters, September 18) but it is unclear that, even with a second resolution, the invasion of Iraq would have been legal. The fact that so many on the left are keen to embrace the UN system and international law is strange, given that the central value of both is not human rights but state sovereignty. <p>I have no doubt that Tony Blair dissembled over his reasons for taking us to war. To have openly declared his intention to take part in regime change on the basis of the nature of Saddam's rule would have opened him to prosecution under the international criminal court. To aid the victims of tyranny is illegal; to defend yourself from the threat of WMD is not. </p> <p>Too many on the left treat the UN and the system of international law as if it was what they wished, rather than as what it is. The focus on state sovereignty means that it protects tyrants, not their victims. There may be those who want to insist that there was some other way to rid Iraq of Saddam. But sanctions only hurt the Iraqi people, not the regime. And both non-violent and violent internal opposition was brutally suppressed. Even Saddam's death was only likely to bring one of his psychotic sons to power. So the war in Iraq may well have been illegal, but that does not make it immoral. Unjust laws are there for the breaking. The principle of state sovereignty is the most unjust law of all. <br> <b> Adam E Rule</b><br> Newcastle </p> <p>Just as Tony Blair admits that Iraq has become a \"crucible\" for the battle against global terrorism, a senior diplomat, Sir Ivor Roberts, gets flack for stating that Bush has been a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaida (Al-Qaida would back Bush, says UK envoy, September 21). If Blair thinks Iraq has become this crucible, then surely we should be asking why. </p> <p>It seems that the prime minister has ignored Foreign Office concerns for some time over the intelligence on weapons, the legality of the war and the dangers of the postwar environment in favour of listening to Bush. His linkage of Iraq and terrorism is a linkage that many foresaw before the war. A little more humility from Blair in front of this barrage of expert advice and perhaps Britain might have steered a slightly safer course through choppy waters. <br> <b>Chris Doyle</b><br> Director, Council for Arab-British Understanding </p> <p>Dan Plesch repeats the call for impeachment (Comment, September 22), but in the democratic era the idea that the House of Lords should be able to remove a prime minister is complete nonsense. </p> <p>In the pre-democratic era impeachment was a way of \"liquidating\" opponents. Now the ballot box is available for political opponents, and the criminal courts for criminals, which is why a commons select committee recommended abolishing impeachment in 1967. If the opposition wishes to try to remove the prime minister at any time they can move a vote of no confidence, or wait for the general election. </p> <p>In reality, the impeachment call is just a publicity stunt. Tony Benn says on the same page: \"The House of Commons voted for the war and MPs are unlikely to go into the lobby to condemn themselves\" (MPs can end this Iraq folly, September 22). He could have added that many of us who voted against the war reject any charge that the prime minister acted in bad faith. </p> <p>In a free society everyone is entitled to oppose their rulers, but using lawyers and lords to try to topple an elected government is fundamentally undemocratic. <br> <b> Kevin Brennan MP</b><br> Lab, Cardiff West</p>",
  "Whenever the perennial debate on Can Pornography Be Art? takes place, the films of Russ Meyer, who has died aged 82, are raised as positive exemplars. Considered part cinema visionary and part dirty old man, Meyer proudly proclaimed himself a pornographer, but a first-class one. John Waters, a gay disciple, didn't consider him a pornographer at all. \"He has way too much style to be just that,\" declared Waters. <p>Whatever one calls the films - sexploitation (the female nude is shown purely for sexual or commercial reasons), softcore (no erections or ejaculations), kitsch (bad taste), camp (\"its essence being its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration\", in Susan Sontag's definition) - there is one word that could sum them up: breasts. </p> <p>Most of Meyer's films revolve around the large cleavages of his leading ladies, such as Tura Satana, Lori Williams, Kitten Natividad, Uschi Digard and Haji. \"I love big-breasted women with wasp waists,\" he told interviewers on every occasion, as if it were a revelation. His self-published, three-volume autobiography was called A Clean Breast: The Life And Loves Of Russ Meyer. </p> <p>Meyer's \"nudie-cutie\" films gained him a cult following in the 1960s, widened when he made a rare excursion into big-budget cinema with Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls (1970), which was described by Alexander Walker as \"a film whose total idiotic, monstrous badness raises it to the pitch of near-irresistible entertainment\". </p> <p>Russell Albion Meyer was born in Oakland, California, the son of a police officer and a nurse. With money borrowed from his mother, he bought an 8mm Univex \"picture-taking machine\" when he was 12 and began making amateur films. He became a combat photographer and newsreel cameraman for the Army Signal Corps during the second world war, shooting under dangerous conditions in France and Germany. </p> <p>After the war, Meyer started photographing nude models for magazines, shooting some of the first centrefolds for Hugh Hefner's newly launched Playboy. He married his second wife, Eve Turner, who became one of the first Playmates, and after whom he named his first company, Eve Productions. </p> <p>Meyer's debut film was The Immoral Mr Teas (1959), which told of a delivery man (played by Bill Teas, an army friend of Meyer's) with the ability to see fully clothed women naked. The film was a breakthrough in the US because previous nudie films were either naturist romps or hypocritical moral tracts preaching the dangers of unbridled sex. It cost Meyer \u00a324,000 to make but earned him \u00a31m. </p> <p>He now led the skin-flick market with garish, grotesque and gruesome comic strip erotica, lasciviously coupling dumb hunks with busty broads, such as Eve And The Handyman (1961), Wild Gals Of The Naked West (1962) and Fanny Hill: Memoirs Of A Woman Of Pleasure (1964). In a sense, Meyer was a true auteur as he produced, directed, wrote, photographed and edited the films himself - and became very wealthy in the process. </p> <p>Most of the cast of the cultists' favourite, Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965), which was succinctly described as \"Three dominatrixes with huge tits and tiny sports cars sought in murder\", were culled from LA strip clubs and Playboy magazine. The plot - three belted, buckle-booted, buxom go-go dancers on a crime spree - demonstrates, according to the pompous male narrator, the horrors of the \"predatory female\". Both hetero and homo male audiences, as well as revisionist feminists, revelled in it, from different viewpoints. </p> <p>There followed the sloppily made and unpleasant Vixen (1968), in which the eponymous heroine (Erica Gavin) lives in a Canadian mountain resort and lusts after her biker brother. She is openly racist, rejecting her brother's black friend by remarking that she would not \"make it with monkeys\". Meyer even throws in a discussion about Cuban communism. Unaccountably, Vixen earned \u00a36m on a \u00a376,000 investment. </p> <p>In 1970, 20th Century Fox hired him for two \"mainstream\" studio projects, the melodrama Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls and The Seven Minutes (i.e. the time it takes for a woman to have an orgasm). The former was written by critic Roger Ebert. It was Meyer's favourite. \"Roger and I embraced that one to our bosoms, or co-bosoms,\" he explained. </p> <p>The film is a self-styled morality tale, in which each character represents a vice or a virtue. The diaphanous plot concerns an all-girl rock group, the Carry Nations, handled by Z-man Barzell (John Lazar), which reaches the dizzy heights of fame and then falls into decadence, with a lot of perverted sex, drugs and backstabbing. </p> <p>The Seven Minutes, Meyer's only \"straight\" movie, was a less happy affair. About a pornography trial, it featured a bunch of has-been Hollywood actors, including Yvonne de Carlo and John Carradine, and Meyer's then wife, Edy Williams. </p> <p>Meyer then returned to independent shoestring productions with Supervixens (1975) - psycho cop, Nazis and nymphomaniacs - and Beneath The Valley Of The Ultravixens (1979), about a randy housewife who changes from Lovonia to stripper Lola Langusta. As usual, there are tight close-ups of breasts, but there is more full-frontal nudity than before. </p> <p>Much to Meyer's surprise, after his retirement, his films were given the seal of aesthetic approval with seasons at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood and the NFT in London. </p> <p>Meyer married and divorced a few times and lived with a series of models, Playmates, strippers and actresses. According to a forthcoming TV documentary soon to be aired on Channel Five and a soon-to-be-published biography by Jimmy McDonough, Meyer has left an unknown son and heir.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Russ (Russell Abion) Meyer, film-maker, born March 21 1922; died September 18 2004</p>",
  "The price paid by Britain for Tony Blair's decision to join the invasion of Iraq has until now been relatively low. British casualties have been proportionately fewer than those of the Americans. By occupying the Shia-dominated south, British troops were at least initially spared the scale of guerrilla attacks that greeted US forces from the first days. Few Britons had until this week been caught up in the kidnappings sweeping Iraq and, despite dire government warnings, Britain has so far been spared the kind of revenge attack suffered, for example, by Spain - which Blair was told to expect in intelligence briefings in the run-up to war. <p>Now all that is changing. Since the start of Moqtada al-Sadr's insurrection last April, resistance has mushroomed across the south. In recent weeks British forces have been under regular assault, caught up in bloody firefights and forced back to barracks by the increase in attacks in Basra, Amara and elsewhere. Evidence has been piling up of the killing and maltreatment of Iraqis in and out of custody by British troops, whose local reputation for brutality is a far cry from the benign paternalism often hailed in the British media. And now a British engineer working at a US military base faces the horrific fate meted out to his two fellow American kidnap victims, who were apparently decapitated in person by the Jordanian jihadist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said to be linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>Zarqawi and his tactics are opposed by much of the mainstream Iraqi national resistance, which now shows every sign of enjoying commanding popular support among Iraq's Arab population. But the attention he has attracted only serves to highlight the forces that have been unleashed by the Anglo-American war. </p> <p>Until last year, the only group in Iraq linked to al-Qaida operated in the US- and British-patrolled Kurdish area, beyond Saddam Hussein's writ. Now every Afghan jihadist veteran who wants to can stage kidnappings and suicide attacks throughout Iraq: this is Tony Blair's \"cockpit of international terrorism\", conjured into being by his own government. And as the quisling prime minister Ayad Allawi - whose real authority can be measured by the US veto of any release of the Iraqi women prisoners demanded by Kenneth Bigley's kidnappers - declared at the weekend: \"If Iraq is broken, London will be a target.\" </p> <p>The kidnapping of Kenneth Bigley may yet bring home the Iraq war to Britain in a way that months of TV footage of mayhem and misery have failed to do. The focus on his plight has, of course, been in stark contrast to the utter disinterest in the circumstances in which 300 Iraqis have been killed - most by US forces, many of them civilians - in the past week. But there still remains a sense of unreality in public life about the enormity of what Britain has helped to create in Iraq: a \"crisis of historic proportions\", in the words of the US Democratic challenger, John Kerry. </p> <p>By any normal reckoning, the events of the past few days should have triggered a political crisis in Britain. The conclusion of the Iraq Survey Group that there were no weapons of mass destruction at the time of the invasion, the leaked Whitehall documents confirming that Blair was warned in advance of the likelihood of post-war chaos and, crucially, the declaration by the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, that the war launched by a British prime minister was illegal should be a lethal combination. </p> <p>The implications, after all, could not be more damning. If Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction by the late 1990s, as is now almost universally accepted, Iraq was evidently not in material breach of UN resolutions. If the war was illegal, as is now believed by most global opinion, then the only people fighting legitimately in Iraq are the resistance groups defending their homeland - not the forces of states that committed an international crime by attacking a country without provocation. That is the war still being fought out on the streets of Baghdad, Basra, Falluja and Ramadi - a war now so discredited that Blair is desperate to redefine it as a \"new conflict\" against terror. </p> <p>That these events have not yet led to a decisive crisis of Blair's leadership is above all a function of the fact that Britain was the only one of the original invading coalition to have a centre-left government - and which has therefore been supported over the fundamentals of the war ever since by the main opposition party. But the underlying damage to both the Labour party and the government by their continuing association with such a catastrophic adventure is likely to have fatal political consequences in its impact on public trust and support. The issue of the Iraq war must obviously transcend the bread-and-butter domestic concerns of British politics. That is not only because of the tens of thousands of innocents who have been killed, but because of the hugely dangerous precedent it has set in international relations and the threat it has created to the security of British citizens. </p> <p> F ortunately for the Labour party, a change of policy on Iraq - and the holding of the leadership that launched the war to account - is not only right in principle, but also in Labour's own interests. Next week, the party's annual conference in Brighton could start that process by voting for an early withdrawal of British troops. It is likely to be the party's last chance before the election - short of a change of leader - to begin to undo the damage to itself and lay the ground for change in Iraq. The omens for a withdrawal vote were yesterday not looking that good. The party machine can deploy all manner of tricks to avoid an embarrassing defeat - and so moribund is much of Labour's grassroots organisation that constituency delegates may not be representative of Labour opinion - let alone the 71% of the public who want a date for the withdrawal of British troops. </p> <p>Some will genuinely believe that, even if the invasion was wrong, withdrawal now would only lead to worse chaos or civil war. That is of course the traditional colonial alibi used to justify occupations, but in the case of Iraq - where most of its people say they want foreign troops to leave now - the argument is more than usually unconvincing. Violence and insecurity are already rampant and significant areas of the country have slipped out of the occupiers' control. Only Iraqis can create a stable future for themselves and it is now clear that there will be no security in Iraq while US and British forces remain. Any elections held under the auspices of the occupier - as are planned for January - will lack the legitimacy to calm the resistance. But what they could do is provide a face-saving context for a negotiated British withdrawal - which could in turn help shift US opinion about the value of its own occupation. What is needed next week is for Labour's conference to speak for Britain - and Iraq. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "About two hours into the Beslan school siege, two local men stood by a garage about 10 metres from the ongoing carnage addressing issues of North Ossetia's autonomy. One - squat, unshaven, smelling of last night's moonshine and holding an ancient hunting rifle - turned to the other and said: \"The federal troops are doing a sweep of the building. But that's not their right. We, the local militia, should do that. It's our school.\" <p>The carnage at Beslan was equalled in severity only by the chaos. Moscow seemed to have washed its hands of the entire event. Groups of incredibly brave young Russian interior ministry special forces did the bulk of the fighting. Ten of the country's elite Alpha troops lost their lives. But much of the violence and, it appears, the shooting that caused the gunmen to set off their bombs, came from local militia men. None of Russia's experienced siege experts had thought to erect a barrier to keep these men out. </p> <p>Today the school remains open to the public, a sort of freakish museum designed to entice the fuming local population into further anger and grief. Four days after the siege kids played with bits of flesh left from the militants. An unexploded tank shell sat in the centre of the playground. A Swiss journalist was apparently chased by armed men, who thought he was a terrorist. Moscow had still not taken control. </p> <p>Now, nearly three weeks since the siege's end, the Kremlin has used the tragedy to boost its power over the regions, and push through a redesign of parliament to make it yet more servile to the Putin administration. The foreign ministry has busied itself with complaining about the political asylum in London of the Chechen Akhmed Zakayev, a man whom the security services admit is obsolete within the militant movement. </p> <p>Georgia, where Russia claims militants find refuge, cowers at the threat of pre-emptive strikes. Yet the border between North Ossetia and Ingushetia, where some of the militants came from, remains poorly guarded, despite growing talk of inter-ethnic war. </p> <p>Such a total lack of control and, it seems, interest in the conclusion and aftermath of the Beslan tragedy is somewhat ironic if we recall the issue that got us here in the first place. The Chechen conflict has smouldered for more than a decade because of Russia's insistence on sovereignty: its territorial integrity. Yet in Beslan, and even in Chechnya, Russian sovereignty appears to be a purely nominal issue, and one that does not carry with it any actual responsibility in government. Chechnya, a broken, brutalised country, proved in 1997-98 to be incapable of governing itself without succumbing to the excesses of sharia law and human rights abuses as bad as those inflicted on the population by Russian troops. It has also proved itself to be the source of Islamic extremism in a region where Muslim radicalism is flaring up. Europe, as a whole, has an interest in ensuring this back door remains secure. </p> <p>Yet Moscow, as the Beslan siege amply demonstrated, has not managed to do that. It hasn't stopped the militants from getting so radical that their atrocities defy language. It didn't even set up a proper cordon around the siege until two hours after it had finished. </p> <p>North Ossetia is not Chechnya, yet it is suffering from the same Kremlin indifference to the people in its southern republics. Muscovites often fear North Caucasians as a strange, unpredictable, fiery people, who are best suppressed and avoided. </p> <p>Even President Putin has been to Grozny so few times that during his last visit he remarked at how bad it looked from the helicopter. One would have thought he - and his audience - already knew that. He ordered the city to be carpet-bombed for the second time only four years ago. </p> <p>Putin tried to make all the right noises about preserving order and stability in the region. The town is supposed to have been sealed since the siege. Yet the entire republic remains open. Maybe Moscow has decided to let the North Ossetians get on with their revenge and mourning. Maybe it's decided that it's just too dangerous to get involved in their mess. </p> <p>Or, more worryingly, maybe Putin gave an order, yet found his law enforcement organs too corrupt and incompetent to carry it out. This is the key problem with Putin's police state. Moscow can restrict movement, pass new laws and beef up security, but there is no one to enforce these whims. At a security check in Moscow airport the week after the siege, a policewoman was taking down names of passengers arriving from the south. She asked me how to spell my name. A queue formed, and two colleagues barged through the line and left. No one noticed. </p> <p>Mr Putin is trying to build a police state without a functional police force. His chief prosecutor has admitted corruption will make the fight against terror almost impossible. Yet the Kremlin's first moves have not been to introduce basic anti-corruption initiatives among police, border guards and officials, but instead to increase their own direct powers. Putin seems to still believe the Soviet myth that power commands obedience and respect, despite much of the country being left to its own devices. </p> <p>The Kremlin wants to have the North Caucasus as part of its domain, a fertile backwater that gives it geopolitical reach into the Caspian. But, from the Russian police force to the presidential administration, the idea of government is not accompanied by any sense of responsibility or accountability. So when Beslan needed federal intervention the most - on September 3 - it was left to its own, tragically chaotic devices. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Nick Paton Walsh is the Guardian's correspondent in Moscow </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.walsh@theguardian.com\">nick.walsh@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p> I first met Bernie Ecclestone in spring of 1972. I was a junior reporter on the Motoring News and was instructed to go to his car dealership, James Spencer Ltd in Bexleyheath, to interview him following his purchase of the Brabham formula one team from its co-founder Ron Tauranac. </p> <p>I was met by a dapper, compact man with a Beatles-style haircut and ushered up the stairs into his office where I sat in a low chair as he perched on the desk, looking slightly down on me. He later took a break from the interview to sell a middle-aged couple a second-hand Humber Hawk, a great, big, ponderous blancmange of a car. Most would agree that anyone who could sell a Humber Hawk under any circumstances in 1972 was unusually persuasive. The couple had come in to buy a Ford Cortina. </p> <p>Ecclestone paid around \u00a3100,000 for Brabham, including two completed cars, and inherited a young South African designer called Gordon Murray, one of the company's most outstanding assets as it transpired. One of the few original thinkers in the motor racing business, Murray would go on to design a succession of technically innovative and highly competitive cars for Ecclestone for the remainder of the 1970s and much of the 80s. </p> <p>In his new role as team owner Ecclestone would soon emerge as a leading light in the Formula One Constructors' Association. He made the time and had the mental agility necessary for this particularly specialised challenge. During the formative years of Foca, when Ecclestone was negotiating television coverage contracts and helping to bale out struggling race promoters, he asked the teams whether they wanted to come in with him and share the financial risks of running those events. </p> <p>They chose not to, so Ecclestone became ever richer. Indirectly that reluctance to share the early commercial risk of formula one in the 1970s and 80s contributed to the eventual imbalance of income under the Concorde agreement and the enduring bad feeling over Ecclestone's percentage of revenue. </p> <p>By 1979 it was clear that Ecclestone and the Foca-aligned teams were in a strong position to stake a claim to a larger share of the television income which accrued to the sport's governing body, then known as Fisa, the motor sport arm of the FIA. It was Ecclestone's tireless efforts that had generated all this income for the sport and, quite rightly, Foca felt it was entitled to a larger slice of the cake. </p> <p>The whole affair was aggravated in 1979 when the newly elected Fisa president, the mercurial Frenchman Jean-Marie Balestre, decided to take on Foca, determined to retrieve for Fisa the notional concept of holding the \"sporting power\". </p> <p>Ecclestone now led his Foca-aligned teams into a battle over the fundamental matter of who controlled motor racing. It was a turbulent period during the sport's history with some races being boycotted and others taking place outside the official World Championship. </p> <p>By this time Ecclestone was being helped behind the scenes by his legal adviser Max Mosley, whom he had first met when Mosley was the team principal of the March formula one team in 1970. By 1991 Mosley had risen to the position of FIA president and was now second only to Ecclestone as the most important figure on the international motor racing stage. </p> <p>Foca and Fisa eventually reached an accommodation which was enshrined in the 1981 Concorde agreement, a complex protocol of rules and regulations that was originally framed to control the way in which the sport was administered from a technical, financial and sporting viewpoint. It has been renewed several times since then and, with Ecclestone's companies taking the lion's share of the revenue, has steered him to his current billionaire status over the past two decades.</p>",
  "Kenneth Bigley, the Briton held by kidnappers in Iraq, appeared in internet video footage last night pleading with Tony Blair to take action which could save his life. <p>For the most part composed but with desperation in his voice, the 62-year-old addressed the prime minister directly, telling him he was the only person on earth who could save his life. </p> <p>\"I think this is possibly my last chance to speak to somebody who will listen,\" he said in the grainy tape, which appeared to show him against a black and white background with Arabic writing on it. </p> <p>\"I need you to be compassionate as you always said you were and help me to live so I can see my wife and son and brothers again.\" Several times he raised his hand to his head, rubbing his face in despair. </p> <p>\"I need you to help me now, Mr Blair, because you are the only person on God's earth who can help me.\" </p> <p>It was not possible to confirm when the video was filmed, but it is assumed to have been produced by the Tawhid and Jihad [Unification and Holy War] group which kidnapped Mr Bigley and two Americans last week. Both the Americans were beheaded in the past three days. </p> <p>And in another wretched development, a second militant group said last night that it had killed two female Italian aid workers abducted in Baghdad earlier this month. </p> <p>Mr Bigley's family were last night seizing on the video as a sign of hope, a reprieve that permitted grounds for cautious optimism. </p> <p>But there were few signs last night that the harrowing video plea would produce any sort of deal with the British government. </p> <p>Jack Straw, foreign secretary, said: \"It's adding torture to the appalling situation which these evil terrorists have placed Mr Bigley in. I'm afraid to say it cannot alter the position of the British government.\" </p> <p>Earlier he said he did not hold out a great deal of hope. \"We continue to do everything we can to secure Kenneth Bigley's safe release, but it would be idle to pretend there's a great deal of hope,\" he told reporters in New York, where he is attending the United Nations general assembly. </p> <p>\"I would like to express my profound condolences to the families and colleagues and friends of those two Americans who were working in Iraq for the benefit of the Iraqis.\" </p> <p>The spate of kidnappings over the past six months, many of which have ended in grisly killings, have created security mayhem in Iraq, sending foreigners fleeing and scuppering much reconstruction work. </p> <p>In its second security warning in less than a week, the British embassy said there was a specific threat to kidnap British citizens last night in the same Mansour district of Baghdad where Mr Bigley was seized. </p> <p>The embassy identified two cars, a Mercedes and a BMW, similar to ones used in the kidnapping last week, which it said might be used. </p> <p>Yesterday US officials recovered from a Baghdad street the body of Jack Hensley, the second American contractor to die. Militants later released a video apparently showing his execution, a day after similar footage of the beheading of his colleague Eugene Armstrong was broadcast. </p> <p>Mr Bigley's captors had demanded that all women prisoners in Iraq be freed as the price for his release. </p> <p>\"I don't want to die,\" Mr Bigley said. \"I don't deserve it and neither do the women deserve to be prisoners. Please, please release the female prisoners that are held in Iraqi prisons. Please help them.\" </p> <p>He went on: \"Mr Blair, I am nothing to you. It's just one person in the whole of the United Kingdom, that's all. With a family like you've got a family, with children, like your children, your boys, your wife. </p> <p>\"Please, you can help, I know you can. These people are not asking for the world, they're asking for their wives and the mothers of their children. </p> <p>Earlier there were signs that at least one high-profile female prisoner might be released, raising hopes for Mr Bigley's fate. </p> <p>A senior Iraqi minister said that a biological scientist, Rihab Rashid Taha, would be freed immediately. But although US military commanders had approved the release of the \"high-value\" scientist before the kidnap of Mr Bigley, they insisted she could not be freed yesterday, apparently desperate to avoid making any concessions to the militants. </p> <p>The justice minister, Malik Dohan al-Hassan, promised to release Dr Taha as early as yesterday and said he would consider the case of the second woman, another scientist, Huda Salih Amash. </p> <p>But yesterday US and senior Iraqi officials moved to dash that suggestion. </p> <p>\"We have not been negotiating and we will not negotiate with terrorists on the release of hostages,\" said the prime minister, Ayad Allawi. </p> <p>But the Guardian has learned that Dr Taha was in fact approved for release by US commanders as long ago as last week, before the kidnapping. </p> <p>The case came up with dozens of others as part of a two-month review of \"high-value\" detainees, nearly all of whom are being held by the US military. </p> <p>Although US commanders have the final say in such releases, Iraqi officials also reviewed the case at the start of this week and gave their approval. </p> <p>Qasim Daoud, Iraq's national security adviser, confirmed it had been agreed to release Dr Taha and at least two other detainees but insisted she would not be freed quickly. </p> <p>There were still \"security procedures\" to be completed before she could go home. \"Iraqi judges decided to release them because they didn't have any evidence,\" he said. \"The judges decided on a conditional release. It will not happen today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.\" </p> <p>He insisted his government would not negotiate over the release. \"We have sympathy for the British hostage and his family and the British people but I am afraid we have to stand firmly and reject any negotiations with the terrorists,\" he said. </p> <p>The confusion highlights splits within the new Iraqi cabinet and underlines how much influence US authorities still have in the running of Iraq's \"sovereign\" government. </p> <p>It also emerged yesterday that the spiritual mentor of the militant group behind the kidnap, Sheikh Abu Anas al-Shami, was killed in Baghdad last week when his car was destroyed in a US air strike. Shami called himself grand mufti, or spiritual guide, of Tawhid and Jihad group. </p> <p>Under pressure from Mr Bigley's family, the Foreign Office denied the government was not doing enough and said the Baghdad embassy was working hard to try to secure the businessman's release. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman also denied that the government was negotiating a deal to meet the terrorists' demand, and described the proposed release of the two scientists as \"a hell of coincidence\". </p> <p>Last night Mr Bigley's son Craig, 33, pleaded directly with the kidnappers in a statement on behalf of his family: \"Be merciful, as we know you can be. Release Ken back to his wife and family. We ask you as a family to be all merciful.\" </p> <p>\"Thank you for letting Ken make his appeal. All of the family are very grateful to you for his message. </p> <p>\"They wish you to say to Ken that they love him dearly and are waiting for him to come home to them.\"</p>",
  "<p>The West Bromwich Albion manager Gary Megson is understood to have two matches left to save his job following defeat by Colchester United in the Carling Cup on Tuesday night. </p> <p>Jeremy Peace, the club's chairman, has been keen to replace Megson for some time - his desire increasing as the relationship with his manager has deteriorated.

  "The Liberal Democrats went gently berserk yesterday when they welcomed the victor of Hartlepool to the conference. <p>Well, Jody Dunn isn't quite the victor yet - the byelection is a week today and she's still behind Labour in the polls - but that wouldn't bother this lot. As far as they were concerned, she might have won the seat, become party leader and, while she was at it, taken gold in the Olympic 400 metres. </p> <p>They had laid careful preparations. There was a Jody Dunn poster at every seat. As her moment arrived, stewards put delegates into spare seats to make it look as if the hall was packed, like those \"resting\" actors who are slotted in at the Oscars when the real stars go for a pee. </p> <p>There was even a sheet of paper to advise delegates who might not be used to displaying artificial frenzy. \"Please wave placards at the end of the Jody Dunn speech when indicated by Ed Fordham, who will be standing in front of the stewards' table. Please ensure your placard is the correct way up and displayed towards the stage.\" </p> <p>Which leaves the question, who on earth is Ed Fordham? (Colleagues tell me he is Jody Dunn's press officer.) But even these instructions were too complicated for some delegates, who waved their placards in the wrong direction and in some cases upside down. Still, as I said, Lib Dems don't do dementia. </p> <p>Then she was among us, trim and excitable in a charcoal suit. \"This is a special day for me,\" she said, \"For the first time in two months I have had lunch, and have had it at lunchtime!\" </p> <p>This is not a boast I could make myself, I'm pleased to say, but I also wonder if it is entirely true of Ms Dunn. I glanced over her weblog (jodydunn.org.uk) and discovered it is extremely food intensive. Long accounts of canvassing are interrupted by \"I squeezed in a baked potato at lunch (just!)\" or \"The day ended with an exceptionally healthy meal of chips and garlic sauce\". </p> <p>There are numerous mentions of cake, and a heartrending description of how she yearned for a cooked breakfast and found only cheese salad in the fridge. But there are cheerier moments too. \"Had a nice Chinese earlier in the week. We enjoyed a 69, then went for a meal.\" (No, of course she didn't write the last bit! Just an old joke! Ms Dunn is happily married with four children!) </p> <p>Anyhow, the Lib Dems managed to make some noise, if not a great deal. Ms Dunn, who kept pointing her finger at us, like the blonde one in Abba, revealed that, if elected, she would be parliament's first half-Finnish former disc jockey - which would make her a perfect partner to Michael Fabricant, another former DJ with platinum hair, though I suspect hers is real. She could be Barbie to his Ken. Or vice versa! </p> <p>She then bade the entire hall to follow her back to Hartlepool, a cry greeted with loud if not ecstatic cheering. I suspect they found her slightly scary. I know I did. </p> <p>One of her children came onstage, and was cuddled by his mum and by Charles Kennedy, who did the politician's trick of pointing into the audience, as if saying, \"Look, there's my imaginary friend!\" At which the candidate left the platform, no doubt in search of a kebab. </p> <p>Earlier the party debated its new stance on law and order, or \"tough Liberalism\". This means harsh punishments, but in an environmentally sensitive way, so platforms include \"Bring back the birch!

  "A senior adviser to the Liberal Democrats who quit his role as chairman of its working group on employment claims the party has been \"hijacked by a coterie of laissez-faire economists\" determined to reject EU minimum standards in the workplace. <p>The academic and journalist Robert Taylor said yesterday he had resigned when it was clear he was going to be prevented from writing a radical employment agenda committed to works councils, in-formation and consultation rights, and proper health and safety standards. </p> <p>He said he had come under pressure from the party frontbench to support a ban on strikes in essential services - a charge denied by the party's industry spokesman, Malcolm Bruce. </p> <p>Mr Taylor's remarks come on the eve of Charles Kennedy's address to the party conference today. Mr Kennedy will tell delegates that they \"are moving from the party of protest to the party of power\". </p> <p>Going into detail for the first time about his decision to quit in the spring, the former Financial Times labour editor said yesterday: \"I left the inquiry because I found every proposal was going to have be tested against the most absurd liberal laissez-faire criteria\". </p> <p>Mr Taylor said he was \"told by the party high command that there had to be a preface to my proposals with a robust assertion of the supremacy of the free market, and that we should leave Europe out of it\". </p> <p>The party has not tried to disguise its new deregulatory approach, which is causing unease among party radicals and old-style social democrats. </p> <p>\"I am not a member of any party,\" said Mr Taylor. \"But they kept reassuring me there was a space for social liberals as well as economic liberals. </p> <p>\"It all seemed to flow from their Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, and a belief that the EU is too interventionist. It is becoming ever clearer that a coterie of liberal economists have hijacked the party ... I realised I was going to be stitched up. </p> <p>\"Mr Bruce told me he wanted the policy located in the middle of the Atlantic. I asked what was wrong with the middle of the English Channel.\" </p> <p>Mr Taylor condemned the party's overall approach as worryingly amateurish. \"I asked them where the detailed background work was on the planned abolition of the Department of Trade and Industry, and I was told there was not any. It is an absurd policy just designed to show they can save money, yet most of the functions are going to have to be transferred to other departments.\" </p> <p>The party said a detailed plan would be published soon. </p> <p>\"I did not have a big row with them,\" Mr Taylor said. \"I just heard the warning bells ringing and decided it was better to quit then, rather than have a big bust-up later. </p> <p>\"They have moved to the right, and in an important area that in my view means they will not make much headway with traditional Labour supporters ... They [may] have made the correct strategic choice to go after Tory votes, but I did not want to be part of that.\" </p> <p>The paper Mr Taylor prepared is not available at the conference or online. A policy is due next spring. </p> <p>The new group chairman, Alan Sherwell, said work was going well. Plans for a strike ban had been discussed and dropped, and Mr Taylor had not put his ideas to a vote.</p>",

  "The grandson of Sir Winston Churchill waged a 25-year private campaign at the highest levels of government to persuade it to buy the wartime prime minister's papers from him because he had \"very little money of his own\", according to a Whitehall file released today. <p>Winston Churchill, the former Tory MP for Davyhulme, finally succeeded in 1995 when John Major agreed to pay \u00a312.5m in national lottery money for Sir Winston's invaluable archive, which many believed already to be the property of the state. </p> <p>The political row that followed raged all the way through the 1997 general election campaign. </p> <p>At the time the purchase was justified on the grounds there was a danger that the 2,000 boxes of Sir Winston's official, semi-official and personal correspondence, from his earliest years up until the end of 1945 - including early drafts of wartime speeches such as the \"finest hour\" Battle of Britain speech - would have to be sold to the US. </p> <p>But a Treasury solicitor's file released at the National Archives at Kew today shows that the Tory MP had been trying to \"cash in\" the family silver since 1971 - only six years after his grandfather's death. During the 25-year campaign successive cabinet secretaries were lobbied on his behalf using Whitehall's \"old boy\" network. </p> <p>The file reveals that the first approach was made in May 1971 when Sir Winston's former private secretary Sir Jock Colville wrote to the then cabinet secretary, Sir Burke Trend, \"unofficially\" suggesting that the government buy them for \"\u00a3100,000 or perhaps \u00a3120,000\". </p> <p>He said since Randolph Churchill, Sir Winston's son, had died in 1968 the grandson claimed to be in financial difficulties and the papers were \"the most valuable asset he possesses\". Sir Jock urged the government to buy them, saying: \"Winston therefore felt that since he has in fact very little money of his own (Randolph having been a very large spender!) it was a little bit rough if he just had to surrender the papers without any quid pro quo.\" </p> <p>Sir Jock told the cabinet secretary that young Winston had \"rather hoped that [Walter] Annenberg [then US ambassador in London] would buy them for, say, $250,000 and immediately present them to Churchill College. I threw a fly over Annenberg but he did not rise in at all an enthusiastic manner,\" Sir Jock wrote, using a trout fishing allusion. </p> <p>Churchill's private secretary admitted that the question of ownership of the papers was complicated, with about 50% of \"this important historical asset\" private correspondence and the rest state papers \"which HM government could reasonably maintain were theirs anyway. But Winston would at least have something for realising his most valuable asset.\" </p> <p>The official reply was \"a flat 'no'\" The official involved, HG Ware, added a note on the file: \"Future negotiations may be rather difficult in view of young Winston's desire for money.\" </p> <p>Sir Burke Trend said: \"Any question of trying to buy the Churchill papers would come up against insuperable difficulties. There are no public funds which would permit the government to contemplate [this] sort of offer.\" </p> <p>The problem arose because when Churchill left office he had taken a large number of papers with him \"on permanent loan\", including many state documents, and despite several official requests had refused to return them. After his death they were placed under the control of the Chartwell Trust, for the \"use and enjoyment\" of the younger Winston and his heirs. </p> <p>The file shows that Whitehall learned of another concerted attempt in 1989 when officials warned \"in absolute strictest confidence\" by Corelli Barnett, the keeper of the Churchill College archives, that Mr Churchill was seeking a new valuation of the archive from Sotheby's. He had been told it was for insurance purposes: \"Mr Barnett is deeply suspicious of the motives of the trustees ... he believes they are seeking to make money and remove it from Churchill College,\" reported Pat Andrews of the Cabinet Office. </p> <p><b> Suspicious</b><br> </p> <p>Mr Barnett told Whitehall in May 1990 that Sotheby's had valued the archive at \u00a315m and the Conservative MP had proposed to the college that they sell the papers to the British Library \"for a fair sum\", and that the papers be loaned back to the college. The Treasury solicitors said there was no legal difficulty with the proposal except for problem caused by the \"excessively generous terms sought by the trustees\". </p> <p>But the Cabinet Office raised objections, with Pat Andrews noting: \"There seems to me something quite wrong about all this.\" </p> <p>The matter was discussed with the cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler, who said: \"The dilemma is whether the government should be prepared to pay money for something of which we assert at least part is ours.\" </p> <p>In the event it was Norman Tebbit who pressed the case on behalf of Mr Churchill. He wrote to Mr Major in March 1991 saying unless there was a negotiated private sale the archive faced being broken up and moved abroad: \"I am told the sum involved would not be huge,\" he said. In fact, a memorandum enclosed with the letter from the Chartwell Trustees admitted that a sale abroad was unlikely \"in the foreseeable future\". </p> <p>The file ends at this point but the payment of \u00a312.5m in lottery funds direct into the pockets of a Tory MP was ruthlessly exploited by Labour in the 1997 general election, when it campaigned on the slogan \"for the many, not the few\". </p> <p>Or as Sir Winston nearly said: \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much paid out by so many to so few.\"</p>",
  "<p>The outgoing European commission yesterday set the scene for a prolonged battle over Britain's opt-out from the working time directive, with the CBI promising to fight proposed revisions \"tooth and nail\" and the European TUC denouncing plans to extend maximum working hours from 48 to 65 a week.</p> <p>Stavros Dimas, the employment and social affairs commissioner, said his revised plan was a balance between \"flexibility and security\", but both sides of industry said it was a compromise that satisfied nobody. </p> <p>Stephen Hughes, Labour MEP and socialist group spokesman on employment, warned that parliament could make a legal challenge against the commission because the proposals were a retreat from the original directive, scrapping the policy of balancing work and family life. </p> <p>Mr Dimas claimed to have responded to government and employer pressure to remove an effective union veto over an individual's right to waive the limit on working hours. </p> <p>But the CBI and the EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, claimed the veto remained, while the government, which sees the opt-out as a cornerstone of flexible labour markets, said the commission's proposals were far from clear and foresaw a stiff fight in the council of ministers and parliament. </p> <p>\"The Brits have got away with murder on this one,\" a senior EU source said, who insisted it was up to national governments to decide if individ ual workers could opt-out, as now, of their own volition. </p> <p>The revised directive, scaled back from tougher proposals circulated late last week, calls for a dual system. \"The individual opt-out will require prior collective agreement or agreement among social partners but only in those cases where such agreements are possible under national legislation and/or practice.\" </p> <p>Brussels says that a third of the UK workforce has opted out but only half of these people work more than 48 hours, the current maximum. The TUC said that still means 3.75 million opted out and one in four who signed up say they were given no choice. </p> <p>The government said it would look \"constructively\" at commission proposals to stamp out abuses.</p>",

The latest in the disturbing Silent Hill series tries to broaden the appeal by adding arcade action sequences to the point-and-click adventure.</p> <p>The idea at the heart of this game - being trapped in your bloodstained apartment with no one able to hear your screams - is a minimalist conceit worthy of a Japanese horror movie. Using alternative realities that allow you to move around in a series of third-person flashbacks feels like just another compromise to the demands of making games over making movies. Similarly, you're constrained by an inventory system that allows you to carry no more than two ammo clips, and tedious onscreen hotspots that have to be clicked one by one. While the visual effects are impressive, the photo-realistic camera induces nausea if watched for long periods.</p> <p>But the biggest problem is not being able to turn precisely to tackle enemies who otherwise lack the speed or intelligence to threaten.

As a result, the gripping storylines revolving around zombie infestations have been neutered. Instead, Outbreak has five missions which, although they refer to Resident Evil games of yore, have no narrative thrust.</p> <p>There are a few legacies from the online version: you order artificial intelligence allies around and the game carries on when you enter the inventory screen. But the screen is clunky and unintuitive, so you find yourself beset by zombies while trying to reload your gun. In gameplay terms, Outbreak is familiar: you deal with zombies and find objects with which to solve puzzles. In terms of atmosphere and graphics, the game is faultless.

  "<p>Uganda's dramatic progress in combating HIV/Aids has been undermined by a new survey which challenges the country's reputation as a beacon for a continent that is being ravaged by the disease. </p> <p>The non-governmental National Guidance and Empowerment Network, which surveyed 53 of the country's 56 districts, claimed yesterday that 17% of the adult population was infected - more than four times the official rate. </p> <p>The network said a 14-month survey by members who were themselves HIV positive contradicted estimates from the government and the United Nations, which said just 4.1% of adults had the virus. </p> <p>If validated, the statistics would be a devastating setback not just to Uganda but to other African countries which looked to it as a model for reining in a pandemic which infects some 25 million Africans. </p> <p>Experts were sceptical about the NGO's unorthodox methodology and said 17% was too high. But several agreed the official rate was too low and that Uganda's success story had been oversold. </p> <p>The network is a respected organisation of people living with the virus, which is partly funded by an initial \u00a350,000 grant from Britain's Department for International Development (Dfid). </p> <p>Doubtful of the government's estimate of 1.2 million HIV positive Ugandans, it sent researchers to towns and villages to count the number of sick people suspected of having the virus. </p> <p>\"We used people who are educated and respected in their own communities to do the counting,\" said Rubaramira Ruranga, 56, a serving army major who founded the network and who said he has lived with HIV for 21 years, the last eight with the help of anti-retroviral drugs. </p> <p>\"I was not surprised by the findings because if you look at our rates of teenage pregnancy and fertility it is clear we have not changed our behaviour.\" </p> <p>He accused President Yoweri Museveni's government and its western donors of underplaying the pandemic to promote Uganda as a showcase for aid. Its advocacy of abstinence, fidelity and condoms was credited with rolling back a pandemic. </p> <p>Privately some aid workers echoed the major's allegation but it was rebutted by David Serwadda, director of the institute of public health at Kampala's Makerere University, who defended the government's figures. </p> <p>Speaking at the press conference in which Major Ruranga unveiled his findings, a doctor from the health ministry's Aids control programme, Elizabeth Nagamala, welcomed the research but said it was less scientific than the government's. \"We do not only count patients, we test patients. Not everyone who is sick actually has HIV, and not everyone who has HIV is sick.\" </p> <p>Official statistics are based on so-called sentinel sites at maternity clinics which test pregnant women, of which 6.2% tested positive for HIV. UNAids extrapolated that to estimate that 4.1% of the adult population was infected. </p> <p>For years UNAids has been accused of exaggerating HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and its latest Ugandan estimate reflects a newfound caution. </p> <p>In a tacit admission of the confusion, the government launched a nationwide survey of HIV prevalence two months ago which is expected to be published next year. </p> <p>\"I prefer to wait until then before commenting, but I would say that 17% sounds a little high,\" said Ros Cooper, a health adviser at Dfid's office in Kampala. </p> <p>Beatrice Were, head of HIV/Aids in Uganda for Action Aid, agreed the major's figure was too high, but she said the official measurement overlooked women unable to reach maternity clinics because of poverty, remoteness or the war in the north. \"I would say the infection rate is between 10 and 12%.\" </p> <p>Some anecdotal evidence bolstered that view.</p>",

Rather, it is a consequence of history: the UK has 52 geographic and six non-geographic police forces, constitutionally independent and each more or less responsible for its own IT.</p> <p>Last June, the Bichard inquiry into the Soham murders blew a whistle on this arrangement. It called for a revolution in police IT to ensure \"national solutions are delivered to national problems\".</p> <p>When local police budgets are matters for local accountability, it is not easy to reach a common acceptance of IT solutions. Bichard also called for a national IT system for England and Wales to support police intelligence \"as a matter of urgency\" and investment in the Police National Computer (PNC).</p> <p>Pito, which describes itself as the \"integration and technical authority for the police service\", is the agency bearing the brunt of most of this work. But despite being a sizeable organisation with 700 staff and a spend of \u00a3370m this year, it has little power to tell local forces what to do.</p> <p>Its latest business plan, published last week, paints a picture of an over- stretched agency under heavy pressure to deliver a lengthening list of systems. Introducing the report, chief executive Phillip Webb says that shortfalls in funding have led the organisation to \"curtail some planned work\". This includes enhancements to the national police web portal, <a href=\"http://www.police.uk\">www.police.uk</a>, to make it a two-way service.</p> <p>Webb says that while the portal will continue in service, without additional funding \"its position as a significant route through which the public can supply and receive information cannot be enhanced\". Upgrades to a national command and control system have also been held up.</p> <p>Webb warns that \"resources are tight\" in two other major projects, the Airwave digital radio communications system, and Visor, a register of violent and sex offenders.</p> <p>Airwave is important because it replaces forces' individual analogue radios with a single national digital system, capable of transmitting data (albeit at a slower rate than commercial GPRS) as well as voice calls. Its deployment has been dogged by controversy - first from officers worried about safety and reliability, now by public opposition to new radio masts.</p> <p>Webb says that \"growing opposition to the siting of Airwave masts and the significant technical challenges presented\" are an obstacle, especially in Scotland.</p> <p>With Visor, the main difficulty is transferring data from police forces' existing systems. The system is timetabled to be ready for service in March.</p> <p>Pito's plan says that several other areas of work await funding allocations. One is modernisation of the PNC, a rare example of a nationally used system that is technically obsolete. \"Technically, the PNC is showing its age,\" says the plan. One enhancement the government would like to see is links between the PNC and courts.</p> <p>Pito says it has piloted such links between magistrates courts in Staffordshire, allowing clerks to put details of warrants directly into the computer, rather than passing them on to the police. The Staffordshire trial tracked down 680 offenders in seven months. Representatives of the various organisations are due to meet this month to discuss expanding the project, but no date has been set for its completion.</p> <p>Meanwhile, to cope with what it calls a \"substantial and expanding programme of work\", Pito says it will need more staff over the next two years. Whether that will be possible depends on a Home Office review of the organisation, expected to report in the new year. It will almost certainly recognise that police IT needs more resources - but also that it needs to be run by an organisation a bit more Dirty Harry than Dixon of Dock Green.</p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.police.uk\">www.police.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pito.org.uk\">www.pito.org.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bichardinquiry.org.uk\">www.bichardinquiry.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Bob Woolmer dreams of harnessing Pakistan's volatile brilliance and turning them into the most disciplined and successful team in the world. The Champions Trophy suggests that their new English coach must lasso the same old wild horse after the team that held its nerve so impressively to beat India bucked to an ignominious semi-final defeat yesterday against West Indies. </p> <p>Pakistan's batting, in being dismissed for 131, was not particularly wanton. They just failed to come to terms with a grouchy, but by no means impossible, surface, losing their last seven wickets for 31 runs in only nine overs. The Rose Bowl has been awarded international status prematurely - neither its square nor its facilities are yet of acceptable standard - but this was a desperately sub-standard display. </p> <p>Pakistan's decision to bat first was greeted with incredulity; a choice to delight conspiracy theorists everywhere. Ten-fifteen starts on overcast mornings have made bowling first automatic - in 14 matches only Bangladesh, once, had taken first strike - and even Pakistan's relatively comfortable progress to 65 for one in the first 18 overs will not temper the criticism. </p> <p>\"It was a team decision but obviously I am the captain,\" said Inzamam-ul-Haq. \"It is not a good one-day wicket but we felt that 200 would be difficult to chase. We started well but we just didn't build any partnerships.\" </p> <p>All day, on the grassy bank behind the main stand, stood a multi-coloured van, straight out of the psychedelic drug-induced 60s. It would have been no surprise to discover it was the Pakistan team bus. </p> <p>It all means that, after two weeks of nip and tuck between the finest cricketers in the world, England's opponents in the final of the Champions Trophy will be West Indies, whom they have been playing for most of the year. Cricket loves a sense of familiarity but the sell-out crowd at The Oval on Saturday might feel that this time it is going a bit too far. </p> <p>Not that West Indies' right to contest the final should be questioned. They batted with authority to beat South Africa in the group stages and yesterday, presented by feeble Pakistan resistance, they played with a confidence and control they rarely exhibited in midsummer. </p> <p>Pakistan also gambled on a 19-year-old debutant batsman, Salman Butt, asked him to open and within three balls he was out for nought, edging Ian Bradshaw to Ramnaresh Sarwan at slip. Bradshaw turned in a solid opening spell but Yasir Hameed and Shoaib Malik, with a stubborn 17 off 58 balls, weathered the new ball. Then Dwayne Bravo ran out Yasir from deep point, Shoaib was caught at the wicket, trying to run the ball to third man, and the decline was set in motion. </p> <p>There was even a supporting role for David Shepherd, whose decisions had recently caused Pakistan's chief selector, Wasim Bari, to rail that the English umpire is too old and should retire. It therefore came to pass that Shepherd was the TV umpire charged with a devilishly difficult run-out decision involving Abdul Razzaq. </p> <p>By peering at a replay to judge whether a stump, half-hidden by the wicketkeeper, had been broken by Bravo's throw before Razzaq made his ground, Shepherd eventually managed to give him out. One could imagine Wasim leaping up and down with fury in front of a TV screen in Karachi. </p> <p>The following over Inzamam, who had looked on imperturbably, stroking 21 from 44 balls as if his innings was just a daily constitutional undertaken on the advice of his doctor, edged a gentle outswinger. Pakistan's innings ended with a six-and-out from Shahid Afridi - a suitable finale for a team display straight out of the schoolyard. </p> <p>No one could question the hostility of the response. Shoaib Akhtar tore in around 95mph, hair flailing, and Mohammad Sami, whom Woolmer has been trying to convert into a more controlled bowler, repeatedly cleared 90mph. It was a thrilling rejoinder which briefly set Pakistani horns blaring. </p> <p>Shoaib had Chris Gayle lbw (the ball pitched outside leg), removed Wavell Hinds with a slick return catch and put Brian Lara in hospital. It was left to Sarwan, with an unbeaten 56, to quell the storm. </p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.bobwoolmer.com\">bobwoolmer.com</a> the chatroom was blaming it all on Sourav Ganguly. It takes a vivid imagination to blame India's captain for a Pakistan defeat by West Indies but Ganguly had responded to defeat against Pakistan by extolling the benefits of batting first, so it could all be interpreted as masterful Indian subterfuge. </p> <p>\"Ganguly has conned Inzy,\" said angry-man. \"Inzy looks like he is asleep.\" It is to be hoped that angry-man was not Woolmer in disguise, otherwise the longed for Pakistan unity might not be long for this world.</p>",
  "<p>Sunday's Chinese grand prix promises to be the biggest payday of Bernie Ecclestone's 25-year career as the controller of formula one. On the face of it Shanghai's $400m (\u00a3223m) extravaganza may seem an unlikely alliance between the last surviving totalitarian superpower and one of sport's greatest entrepreneurs but the reality is that it is a hugely profitable exercise for both sides of the political divide. </p> <p>\"There are 1.3bn people in China and we currently have a television viewership in Shanghai and Beijing alone which exceeds the total viewership in the whole of Europe,\" said Ecclestone, who will sweep up more than $40m from the Chinese grand prix alone from fees and trackside advertising. </p> <p>\"I've been 10 years working behind the scenes to get the right place and Shanghai is certainly the right place in my view. It's not a case of the country coming along and saying 'Bernie, can we have a grand prix?' It's a case of me working away to find the right people to talk to, to make the approach to. Just like when we took formula one behind the Iron Curtain for the first time to Hungary back in 1986.\" </p> <p>If Ecclestone is concerned about human rights issues in China, he rationalises that concern in what some might consider a rather simplistic manner. Formula one has clearly become more sanguine about such matters since 1985 when it turned its back on South Africa at the height of apartheid. </p> <p>\"We've never been involved in politics or these sorts of things,\" he said, sitting in a side office of his grey motorhome which dominates the formula one paddock. \"It's not for us to rule a country. I tell people that, when they go into a country, they should respect their laws or not go into that country in the first place.\" </p> <p>Much to the indignation of the competing teams, none of Ecclestone's Shanghai cash bonanza will be shared with them. As things stand under the terms of the Concorde agreement, the teams get a stake only in the television revenues - and only 47% of that, shared among the 10 of them. </p> <p>The news that the Jaguar team is being put up for sale by its owners Ford further highlights the lack of commercial-rights cash filtering through to the poorer teams at the back of the field. </p> <p><strong> High court</strong></p> <p> Ecclestone, who admits that he would probably \"still be a used car dealer\" if he had not become involved in formula one, is currently facing a further legal challenge in the London high court from the three banks which own 75% of SLEC, his formula one operation company, questioning the legitimacy of some directors of F1 Holdings, the company which has day-to-day control of the business and its revenues. Legal experts have speculated that the action could cost him millions of pounds. </p> <p>Yet, if Ecclestone is a man under pressure, he certainly does not look like it. Softly spoken to the point of reticence, he deflects any attempt at criticism with something approaching the injured innocence of a robust entrepreneur struggling to make a living rather than one of the richest men in the UK with a fortune of around \u00a32bn. </p> <p>When Luca di Montezemolo, the Ferrari chairman, recently launched an attack on the current commercial arrangements in formula one, Ecclestone dismissed it as \"the same old record as the last two or three years.\" </p> <p>He added mischieviously: \"It's pure jealousy, 100%. Our company [SLEC] is only making what was agreed in the first place. Nobody has stolen anything but what concerns them [the teams] is what our company is making. They would rather have less money themselves if it meant us having less. But I don't think this or the bank issue will be settled quickly. I'm a realist.\" </p> <p>But does Ecclestone tire of having to defend formula one from accusations that it is currently pretty boring and processional? \"I don't defend it,\" he said. \"It is a matter of fact. But what is quite strange is that television figures and the spectator levels at many tracks have held up well. Is it boring? Well, if you're purely thinking about the winner. It may be a case of looking past the leader of the race as there's been a lot of good competition down the field. </p> <p>\"Don't get me wrong, I'm a Schumacher fan. But would he have won as many championships as he has done if Ayrton Senna had not left us? I very much doubt it. Of course, Ayrton never had the luxuries Michael has had. Michael has never had anybody in his team who has been able, or been in a position, to challenge him and he's certainly in the best team there is.\" </p> <p>He does not believe that Ferrari have learned from the PR own-goal they scored in the 2002 Austrian grand prix when Rubens Barrichello was instructed to relinquish the win to Schumacher. \"They have a policy to win the world championship,\" he said. \"They don't want to take any risks but what's a little bit bad is their selfishness of the team over not wanting to compromise over the regulations to make racing a little more challenging. </p> <p><strong> Modest roots</strong></p> <p> Ecclestone once famously remarked \"first you get on, then you get rich, then you get honest\". It was tongue-in-cheek, perhaps, but a throw-away line which reflects his unpretentious roots as a used car and motorcycle dealer in Bexleyheath. He has never been part of the blue-blooded British motor racing establishment, which is why he takes such obvious satisfaction from putting the British grand prix organisers through the hoop on a reg ular basis. He points to tracks such as Bahrain and Shanghai as new jewels in the formula one crown and has little time for Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club, whom he believes are attempting to get the race on the cheap. </p> <p>\"It would be as simple as taking the German grand prix, scratching out 'Germany' and putting in 'Britain',\" he says, \"but the BRDC don't want to pay for that. They have a product and they are acting as if the whole world wants to buy it. It's not like that. It's the other way round. The 2005 race is far from secure.\" </p> <p>It is believed that he wants to charge Silverstone \u00a38.3m for the 2005 British grand prix rather than the \u00a36m which the BRDC is rumoured to have offered. Yet his impatience with Silverstone seems to soften as the conversation turns towards the prospect of government support for Britain's round of the world championship. </p> <p>\"Most of the races on the calendar, one way or another, now have support, either from regional sources or the government itself in backing the race,\" he said. \"So, when you think of how much a government needs to spend to put on something like the Olympics - a once-in-a-lifetime event - then the cost of a grand prix looks pretty modest.\" </p> <p>There is also the issue of Ecclestone's succession. He is 74 next month, still looks trim and underwent a successful heart bypass operation four years ago. But formula one after he is gone is very clearly something he does not wish to discuss. </p> <p>\"I haven't given it much thought as I'm not planning on dying,\" he says crisply. \"The secret in business is knowing what not to do rather than what to do. Experience is important. We've taken Michael Payne on board after 20 years working on sponsorship and branding for the Olympics and he and some others may have some good ideas for the future.\" </p> <p>Surely this appointment cuts across one of the basic Ecclestone business tenets, namely that delegation is the art of accepting second best? \"I'm not delegating,\" he replied. \"They're advisors.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is seemingly an infinite number of ways we can choose to walk, throw balls or lift coffee cups. So why do we all end up doing it in almost exactly the same way? </p> <p>A scientist studying motor control, Konrad K\u00f6rding of the Institute of Neurology in London, took a lead from economists who have long used equations called utility functions that incorporate costs and benefits of a situation. Perhaps you like oranges better than apples, but oranges cost more. Given a certain budget for fruit, the utility function says how many of each you should buy. </p> <p>Similarly, K\u00f6rding and colleagues observed people's movements, then inferred an underlying utility function that he says describes a preference in their nervous system for certain movements. </p> <p>K\u00f6rding was able to rank a large set of different movements, varied by duration and resistance encountered, relative to each other by individuals' preferences. He found a surprising amount of agreement among the subjects on which movements they preferred. The results appear in Public Library of Science Biology.</p>",
  "<p>For most of the last 5,000 years, Iraq was a key centre of scientific knowledge. Mathematics, developed initially for keeping accounts, gradually spread into far more ambitious areas such as predictive astronomy, making use of data painstakingly collected and recorded at the temples of Uruk and Babylon over several centuries. </p> <p>During the first century after the birth of Islam, Muslim armies defeated the Persians and moved into Iraq. Around 762, the Abbasid caliphs established their capital in the newly founded city of Baghdad from where they ruled the vast Muslim empire for the next five centuries. </p> <p>This was the high point of Islamic civilisation, when scholars of various religions from around the world flocked to the Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom), an unrivalled centre for the study of humanities and for sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology and geography, as well as some more dubious subjects such as alchemy and astrology. </p> <p>Drawing on Persian, Indian and Greek texts - Aristotle, Plato, Hippocrates, Euclid, Pythagoras and others - the scholars accumulated the greatest collection of knowledge in the world, and built on it through their own discoveries. </p> <p>These developments in Iraq were made possible by widespread literacy and also by the availability of paper as an everyday writing material. The first paper arrived in Iraq from China, probably along the silk route via Samarkand, in the eighth century - long before it reached Europe. Shortly afterwards, a paper mill was established in Baghdad, and by the end of the 10th century, paper had replaced parchment and papyrus in the Arab world. </p> <p>Probably the most famous mathematician at the House of Wisdom was al-Khawarizmi, known as the father of algebra - a word derived from the title of his book, Kitab al-Jabr. </p> <p>Several important figures are also associated with the southern city of Basra, another key centre of learning. Al-Jahiz, born in Basra in 776, seems to have come from an ordinary background and as a youth helped his father to sell fish. His most famous work was the seven-volume Book of Animals which included his observations on the social organisation of ants, communication between animals and the effects of diet and environment. Altogether, he wrote about 200 books on a wide range of topics, including The Art of Keeping One's Mouth Shut and Against Civil Servants. He died at the age of 92, allegedly when a pile of books in his personal library fell on top of him. </p> <p>Al-Masu'di, who died in 957, spent some time in Basra writing about his travels to India, China and East Africa. As with many scholars of his day, his interests were broad and his writing contained elements of history, geography, sociology and anthropology which, unusually for the time, he approached in an analytical way. He also explored problems in the earth sciences - such as the causes of earthquakes - and was also the first writer to mention windmills, invented by Muslims in Sijistan. </p> <p>Ibn al-Haytham (also known as Alhazen) worked as a civil servant in 10th-century Basra before taking up science. Moving later to Egypt, he became head of a project to regulate the flow of the Nile but, on investigation, he decided it was impossible. This annoyed the Fatimid caliph in Cairo, and Ibn al-Haytham reputedly escaped punishment by pretending to be mad until the caliph died. </p> <p>Among the mathematical problems he explored was the squaring of the circle. He also wrote a seven-volume treatise on optics and the nature of light. This explored reflection from plane and curved surfaces, refraction, and the structure of the eye - though he did not understand the importance of the lens. </p> <p>Iraqi science went into decline, partly because of natural disasters such as floods, but also for reasons that are familiar today: religious rivalries and problems with internal security. In 1258 the Mongols sacked Baghdad and, according to some accounts, the Tigris and Euphrates ran red with the blood of scholars.</p>"
