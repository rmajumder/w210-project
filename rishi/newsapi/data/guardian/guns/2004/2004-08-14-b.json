  "The US military offensive against Najaf is a dangerous and ill-judged escalation, revealing the violent reality of an occupation that has undergone only cosmetic change since the supposed handover of power to an interim Iraqi administration in June. <p>For more than a week, an aggressive foreign power has addressed an essentially domestic political question by means of tanks, helicopter gunships and F16s. </p> <p>There had been a ceasefire in place between the US forces and their main opponents around Najaf, and mediation efforts had been effective in containing tension. </p> <p>The current violence in the vicinity of one of Islam's most sacred sites appears to be a result of the failure of this mediation to co-opt Moqtada al-Sadr and his movement into a national conference, which the US had hoped would bestow a stamp of approval on the interim government. </p> <p>The offensive is not - as claimed by the US-appointed interim government and by the US military - an action against outlaws, nor is it an attempt to establish security and the rule of law. </p> <p>There is a great deal of random violence in occupied Iraq. Some of this violence is of a purely criminal character and some is of a terrorist nature with more or less vague political objectives - many of the perpetrators are so shadowy as to invite a widespread belief that outside powers are directly involved in fomenting chaos. </p> <p>In the absence of a genuine accounting for past suffering and political crimes and of a process of reconciliation, there is also violence associated with score-settling by political groups. </p> <p>Not least, of course, is the military violence of the 200,000 foreign forces and armed mercenaries, and of the diverse groups resisting their presence in the country. </p> <p>All these forms of violence are escalating, leading to a chaotic and catastrophic outcome. </p> <p>The way to deal with this situation is not to pour petrol on the fire, but to look for an imaginative and honest political way out. </p> <p>Having been appointed by the occupation authority under a corrupted UN oversight process, Ayad Allawi's interim government lacks any legitimacy whatsoever. </p> <p>Its success could only be measured through its ability to address the needs of the Iraqi people, foremost among which is security. </p> <p>The offensive against Najaf is the most crude and inept action possible, and it follows a long line of such actions by the occupation forces and their political leadership. </p> <p>Some Iraqis hoped that the so-called transfer of power would permit a lessening of tension and a quick withdrawal of foreign forces from the cities, to be followed by greater cooperation between police and the population in tackling random violence. </p> <p>It had been hoped that the police would become more effective in protecting doctors and other professionals from targeted kidnap and murder, and that homes, places of worship and other public places would become less insecure, and that efforts would be redoubled to address the abysmal failure to rebuild the infrastructure. </p> <p>Instead, there is now a greater effort at involving the police and other new Iraqi armed forces in waging the United States' war-by-proxy against the political opponents of the occupation. </p> <p>The collapse of law and order has little to do with Sadr. His is one of a number of forces with armed militia operating in the country. </p> <p>Its control of poor slum areas and inner cities resulted from the chaos that was brought about by the occupation; it was not itself the cause of the chaos. </p> <p>The physical destruction of state power, the interference in civil society institutions, and the violence and lack of legitimacy of the occupation were responsible for the emergence of new centres of power and authority that must now be integrated into the political process. </p> <p>In particular, the Sadr movement has a wide appeal among young, poor, marginalised and traditionally edu cated sections of the urban population, and it is irresponsible to ignore or antagonise such a wide section of Iraqi society. </p> <p>These are people who should be allowed to enter the political process through their chosen vehicle. They have a legitimate critique of the present flawed process, which is designed to serve the political objectives of the US administration and its few Iraqi allies. </p> <p>But instead, the US occupation is trying to destroy or marginalise those movements, while also reinforcing existing inequities through media censorship and by heightening tension with neighbouring Iran. </p> <p>After Najaf, where are US troops going? Are they going to encircle Thawra (Sadr City), the Baghdad suburb? Are they going to attack every poor suburb of every city from Kirkuk to Basra? And bomb every town where there have been large demonstrations in opposition to the attack on Najaf? </p> <p>This offensive has already dealt a severe blow to the interim government. It has shown that it is unable to rein in the US presence, and can only fall in line with America's military imperatives. </p> <p>It has shown that the US has no intention of permitting a genuine Iraqi political dialogue or the development of an inclusive democratic process. </p> <p>The action in Najaf is also deeply symbolic. This is not only a Shia issue. Najaf is a holy site for all Muslims everywhere and has particular historical significance for Iraqis.</p> <p>It is the seat of traditional learning and a repository of Iraqi communal and national culture, but it was also the focus of the 1920 uprising against British colonial rule that had set Iraq on the path of independence. </p> <p>Najaf has been a lively centre of commerce, industry and political activity ever since. Nothing cut the last links between Saddam Hussein and large swathes of Iraqi society more than his persecution of Najaf. </p> <p>It is here that Iraq has its greatest tradition in mediation, where social, moral and religious influences can be brought to bear, and where economic regeneration has brighter prospects. Trying to solve Najaf's problems by Yankee fire is a mark of abysmal failure. </p> <p>Some liberals who opposed the war subsequently adopted an argument that the US and Britain now have a responsibility to remain in Iraq and to see to it that the country arrives at the safe shores of democracy and stability. </p> <p>This argument is based on the presumption that, left alone, Iraq would fall into internecine conflict which only the US and Britain, being such civilised and civilising nations, could address. This was always a convenient myth, but the repeated military offensives against Iraqi cities must now make it clear that chaos and internecine conflict is with us already, and it is being expanded and prolonged by foreign military forces. </p> <p>It is time to set an early date for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces and then to ask what can and should be done to help Iraq. </p> <p>\u00b7 Kamil Mahdi is an Iraqi and lecturer in Middle East economics at the University of Exeter </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:K.A.Mahdi@exeter.ac.uk\">K.A.Mahdi@exeter.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Royal Mail is planning to raise the price of first class stamps by 2p to 30p next April after warning yesterday that it was losing an average 5p on every letter sent by the public and small businesses. </p> <p>But Postcomm, the industry regulator, said Royal Mail - which increased the price of first class and second class stamps in April 2003 - would have to cut prices of other products under its three-year price limits. </p> <p>State-owned Royal Mail said the average losses on second-class letters, which cost 21p, were 9p but refused to confirm that it was seeking price rises in April 2005 and at the end of the current price controls a year later. </p> <p>Peter Carr, the chairman of the consumer body Postwatch, accused Royal Mail of stressing bad news to \"fire the first shots in the next price control discussions\" and of under-estimating its postal service profits in its accounts. </p> <p>He said that the audited accounts given to Postcomm showed that profits from Royal Mail's universal service products - letters, parcels and other items delivered across the UK at the same price - had risen from \u00a39m in 2002 to \u00a3322m in 2004. </p> <p>And the regulator said it was \"bemused\" by Royal Mail's regulatory accounts showing the group had made \u00a3220m profit on \u00a38.6bn turnover when it had generated \u00a3348m on \u00a35.9bn sales in postal services and other licensed products. </p> <p>\"Things are not as gloomy as they are trying to make out; they're just softening us up for the next price control and looking for more freedom to cut prices for business customers,\" senior officials said. </p> <p>They pointed out that Royal Mail as yet faced little or no competition from rivals such as UK Mail, TNT Mail, the Dutch postal operator, and Deutsche Post in lucrative bulk business mail. </p> <p>But Adam Crozier, Royal Mail chief executive, said profits generated by bulk business mail had covered the \u00a3247m losses incurred on personal letters, greetings cards and stamped mail from small firms. </p> <p>He said: \"Royal Mail's stamp prices are among the very lowest in Europe. But this is only achieved by cross-subsidy by the customers of bulk and franked mail. </p> <p>\"Competition is rapidly entering the postal market. If - as is likely - competitors take profitable volume from us then our ability to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere mail service is going to be severely weakened.\" </p> <p>For a 60g letter Royal Mail's 28p compares with a charge of 45p in Spain, 78p in France, 79p in Holland, 94p in Germany and \u00a31.12 in Italy.</p>",
  "Nearly 50,000 people are in danger after an earthquake in south-western China cracked the walls of reservoirs, which could collapse, officials said in Beijing. <p>Four people were killed, nearly 600 injured and more than 125,000 left homeless in Ludian county, in Yunnan province, by Tuesday's earthquake, which measured 5.6 on the Richter scale. </p> <p>The tremor damaged 22 rammed-earth reservoirs about 240 miles north of the provincial capital, Kunming.

  "<p>The \u00a360m sale and flotation of Britain's leading drain-clearing company, Dyno-Rod, collapsed last night after potential buyers failed to agree a deal with the founder of the business. </p> <p>Representatives of a management buy-in team set up to acquire Dyno-Rod said the firm's 74-year-old owner, former airline pilot Jim Zockoll, decided not to go ahead with the sale even though all of his terms had been met. </p> <p>The team, led by outside investor Kevin Mahoney, planned to raise \u00a347.5m towards the purchase through floating the group on the London stock market, and would have assumed \u00a313m in debt. </p> <p>The move was postponed this week after the buy-in team failed to reach a deal with Mr Zockoll and it fell through last night. </p> <p>The stockbroker Seymour Pierce, which was managing the deal for the investor group, said yesterday: \"We are hugely disappointed that, despite the enormous efforts of the management team and the advisers to meet the asking price, the vendor has decided not to proceed even though his terms were met.\" </p> <p>No one from Dyno-Rod was available for comment last night.

  "<b> <b>\u00b7</b> I started a new job on August 4 last year. On July 30 this year, I was called into a meeting and sacked on the spot, supposedly on the grounds of redundancy. I would like to bring an unfair dismissal claim in connection with my dismissal, but I understand that I can't because I don't have a year's service. Is this right?</b> <p>In most circumstances, an employee must have one year's continuous employment to claim unfair dismissal. However, if you are dismissed without notice, the law states that when determining whether you have sufficient service to bring a claim, a period equivalent to the statutory minimum notice must be added on. </p> <p>In your case, the statutory minimum notice was one week (because you were employed for a period of less than two years). If one week is added to the end of your employment, it takes you past the one-year point. So, yes, you can bring a complaint of unfair dismissal. </p> <p>Even if it were not possible to extend your period of continuous employment artificially in this way, it is worth remembering that there is a limited range of circumstances in which you can claim unfair dismissal without having one year's service. For example, if you are dismissed in connection with pregnancy or taking maternity leave, health and safety functions, whistle-blowing, or asserting a statutory right. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> I am a manager in an IT company.

Can my employer do this? </p> <p>Your employer cannot make a deduction from your wages unless the deduction is made in accordance with a statutory provision, or a relevant provision of your contract of employment, or you have previously signified your consent to the making of the deduction in writing. </p> <p>It does not seem that there are any statutory provisions which apply to you in this context. You should therefore look carefully at your contract and check whether your employer has reserved the right to make deductions from your salary. </p> <p>If your employer has reserved the right to make deductions, you should check the particular circumstances - for example, can it make deductions in the context of disciplinary proceedings? Can it make deductions and issue a written warning on the same occasion? Are deductions only permissible in the context of serious acts of misconduct or negligence? </p> <p>If your contract of employment does not cover your particular circumstances or is silent on this issue, and you have not otherwise given your consent to such deductions, you should challenge your employer's actions. If your employer will not reverse its decision, you may be able to bring a claim in an employment tribunal for unlawful deductions from your wages.</p>",

  "A traffic jam of wheelchairs and stretchers brought the centre of Lourdes to a standstill early yesterday. <p>Young volunteers pushed the elderly and weak from hospices in every corner of the town and lined them up in neat rows in the main square for morning mass. </p> <p>Many of the 10,000 or so sick pilgrims who have made their way here this week joined the prayers from their hospital beds, some attached to drips and breathing apparatus. Others were pulled along in rickshaw-like chairs provided by the city. </p> <p>The crush this morning will be even worse as about 350,000 visitors gather to welcome Pope John Paul II on his second trip to Lourdes. No healthier than many of the pilgrims, he will be greeted as \"an invalid among invalids\". </p> <p>The French Catholic press has made much of the poignancy of this journey to a shrine visited every year by more than 60,000 sick Catholics in search of a miraculous cure. </p> <p>Although the Vatican insists that the Pope, 84, will not be praying for relief from Parkinson's disease, the image of the frail pontiff alongside fellow sufferers promises to be a powerful one. </p> <p>By making it plain that this is a personal pilgrimage, rather than a state visit, the Pope is hoping to avoid the tensions which have tainted his relations with the secular French state during his seven previous tours. </p> <p>So that the president, Jacques Chirac, does not have to compromise his secular leadership by entering Lourdes, the Pope will have a swift meeting with him in the neutral environment of Tarbes airport this morning. </p> <p>But it is the Pope's health, not his political statements, that fascinates most visitors. </p> <p>A suite of rooms has been reserved for him tonight in the Notre-Dame sanctuary, built in 1997, where he will spend the night alongside about 850 sick pilgrims. </p> <p>Anxious to avoid a repeat of his frail appearance during a trip to Slovakia last September, his entourage has ensured that this visit will be physically undemanding. </p> <p>Father Liam Griffin, who has been based in Lourdes for eight years, said: \"People are often horrified by the way the Pope looks now, but despite his illness he remains very active. In coming here he is sending out a strong message about the enormous opportunities available to the sick. </p> <p>\"Lourdes is one of the few cities in the world where invalids are not hidden away. Here they take precedence over everyone else; that's why his visit is so symbolic.\" </p> <p>Rolling a cigarette outside the hospice, Jacques Manguin, 51, who travelled from a residential care home near Paris on Tuesday for his 18th pil grimage to Lourdes, said he hoped to kiss the Pope's hand. </p> <p>\"He's God's representative on Earth. Who wouldn't want a chance to touch him?\" </p> <p>At first glance, Lourdes looks like any popular holiday town. Tour buses thunder through its narrow streets, hot tourists loaded down with video cameras crowd into its snack bars, and the centre is crammed with hotels and gift shops. </p> <p>A strong smell of candles wafts from the churches (900 tonnes of wax are burned here every year), but it is the background noise that is distinctive - a mixture of bells, the tinny hum of prayers being broadcast through crackly loudspeakers and the constant creak of badly maintained wheelchairs. </p> <p>Yesterday, handfuls of Scouts were gathered throughout the city, clapping, singing and shaking tambourines. </p> <p>Nuns of every description collected in the streets for impromptu prayers. Children kneeled to pray outside the Church of the Immaculate Conception and priests in long cream robes sat on plastic chairs in the main square to take confession. </p> <p>Everywhere there were queues of wheelchairs waiting to enter the sacred grotto, where a local girl is said to have had visions of the Virgin Mary in 1858, or the baths, where adults can be rebaptised with holy spring water. </p> <p>Emerging misty-eyed from the ivy-covered rockface shrine to Mary, Solainge Ivonnet, 86, a retired butcher, said she had made the pilgrimage in the hope of finding a cure to help her walk again. </p> <p>\"It's a bit egotistical, but if I see the Pope I'm going to ask him to do something about my knee,\" she said. </p> <p>She travelled on a chartered train from Lille, adapted to accommodate bedridden passengers. </p> <p>\"Even if I'm still using crutches at the end of the trip, I will have benefited from a dose of spiritual healing.

  "American prisons, struggling with growing numbers of inmates and falling budgets, are billing prisoners for their stays. <p>In Macomb county in Michigan, \"pay to stay\" fees range from $8 (\u00a34.34) to $56 a day, according to what an inmate can afford. </p> <p>Former prisoners can go back to jail for not paying the bill or have their car seized by the local sheriff. </p> <p>More than 40 states allow their jails to charge fees, according to the national institute of corrections. </p> <p>The charges are popular with many, but campaigners for prisoners' rights say they place too heavy a financial burden on a group of people already poor and excluded. </p> <p>Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, told the New York Times: \"Most inmates are not drug kingpins with lots of assets.

  "An American request for a British terrorist suspect to be handcuffed in a central London court was dismissed by a judge hearing the extradition case yesterday. <p>Babar Ahmad, 30, a computer analyst from Tooting in south London, was appearing for a second time at Bow Street magistrates court.

His request, he added, was based on confidential reports showing Mr Ahmad's alleged links with terrorist groups. But the district judge, Christopher Pratt, refused the application. </p> <p>Joanna Evans, counsel for Mr Ahmad, told the court: \"My client is of previous good character and a professional man. He believes this to be a politically motivated prosecution and refutes absolutely the allegations against him ... There will be [a] bail application ... in due course.\" </p> <p>Ms Evans said the court was surrounded by heavy security and insisted that Mr Ahmad posed no danger of violence or escape. Last week he appeared in the same court without handcuffs. Mr Ahmad was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, she told the court, after being subjected to a \"humiliating and brutal\" assault when first arrested last year. \"He was handcuffed and traumatised to such an extent that the scars remain on his wrist,\" she added. </p> <p>Mr Ahmad was rearrested on August 5 and allegedly found to have had email links to a Chechen mujahideen leader who planned the Moscow theatre attack and operated pro-jihad websites. </p> <p>He is also said to have obtained plans of a US navy battle group in the Gulf which included comments on the ships' vulnerability to terrorist attack. He faces four charges in the US, carrying sentences of between 20 years and life imprisonment, relating to the alleged offences between 1998 and 2003.

  "<b>The itchy issue of religion</b> <br> <p>Humanists cannot ignore God, argued David Boulton in the <b>New Internationalist</b> (August), because religion is an \"itch\" humans are born to scratch. \"It once seemed that reason was leading us to lose faith in religion, but we woke up to find that we had lost faith in reason ... We know that things we are liable to read in the Bible ain't necessarily so. But religion ... gives us our roots and our reassurance that there is a meaning.\" </p> <p>That has not changed throughout history, he continued. Our ancestors used symbols and symbolically mediated behaviour to \"signify who they were, creating art, ornament, design [and] a sense of beauty and truth to map their world, give it shape, coherence and purpose. Today's itch may lead us to seek meaning and purpose in the quest for social justice, or art, science, astrology, shopping, or sex and drugs. But only a blinkered ... humanism chooses to ignore the heritage of religious culture ... We still need a little salvation, healing, from time to time; a sense of at-one-ment with ourselves and the rest of the universe; redemption as restoration; an assurance that our ludicrous inability to be the people we would like to be is ultimately forgivable and forgiven.\" </p> <p><b>Cotswolds are bouled over</b><br> </p> <p>If <b>Country Life</b> (August 12) is to be believed, croquet faces a challenger in the shires of Britain, in the form of boules. \"I hear plaintive chansons, the music of an accordion and the clink and chink of a game of p\u00e9tanque being played,\" said Camilla Edwards.

Played competitively, it is a game of quite astonishing skill. The aim is to place your boules closer to the jack than your opponents'. Simple, you might think, but it requires considerable nerves, tactics and teamwork.\" The sport's \"trump card\", Edwards said, was its accessibility. \"It caters to all talent and all age groups, and it bridges social divides - even the English channel (although our enthusiasm does not yet match the passion of the 10 million Gauls who play).\" </p> <p><b>Radiate not fade away</b><br> </p> <p>Radiation is measured in milliSieverts (mSv) a year. The maximum dose regarded as safe for the general public is 1mSv. Current policies for radiation safety are based on the \"linear no threshold assumption\", which says that even the smallest amount of radiation is harmful. But Dick Taverne in <b>Prospect</b> (August) reckoned that this assumption might be wrong. </p> <p>He argued that the effect of radiation is not a linear one, but is a J-shaped curve. \"Exposure starts by being beneficial at a low dose and only becomes harmful at higher dose. A low dose of ionising radiation seems to stimulate DNA repair and the immune system, so providing a measure of protection against cancer,\" Taverne argued. This is known as hormesis and has been evident in detailed studies into the long-term effects from the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \"Studies ... of survivors who suffered relatively low amounts of radiation show that their life expectancy turned out to be higher than those of a control group and no unusual genetic defects have been found in their children.\" </p> <p>Chernobyl \"is constantly cited as an example of the unparalleled threat to health from nuclear disasters\", said Taverne. Thirty-one people died, mainly among rescue workers who were exposed to very high doses of radiation. \"Yet in ... May 2001, in the Ukrainian town of Pripyat, which was a ghost town after its complete evacuation, the average amount of persistent radiation found was 0.9mSv a year, five times lower than the level in New York's Grand Central station.\"</p>",
  "A wealthy white Republican contributor is funding adverts on black radio stations in important battleground states denouncing the Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry, as \"rich, white and wishy-washy\". <p>The adverts also ridicule Mr Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, for boasting of her African roots. She was born and raised in Mozambique under colonial Portuguese rule. </p> <p>In another, Mr Kerry is criticised for not voting on a bill to extend unemployment benefits, because he was campaigning. </p> <p>\"It lost by one vote,\" the advert says. \"Maybe Kerry thought the more of us who are unemployed and hurting, the more likely we would vote Democrat.\" </p> <p>The ads, which have infuriated the Kerry camp, are run by a Washington-based organisation called People of Colour United, backed by J Patrick Rooney, a white American who owns a medical insurance firm. </p> <p>The company stands to profit from the prescription drug law passed last year by President George Bush. </p> <p>Mr Rooney told the Washington Post: \"I support [the] group because the genuine word from the black community should be heard, not white folks saying it for them.\" </p> <p>African-American support is crucial to the Democratic party, which won more than 80% of the black vote in 2000. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's deputy campaign manager, Bill Lynch, said: \"It's disgusting that the president's political allies are now using race as a political weapon.\" </p> <p>But Republicans and critics in the black community claim the Democrats have been taking the black vote for granted. </p> <p>Virginia Walden-Ford, who runs People of Colour United, said she was perturbed by African-Americans who say that they will vote Democrat \"because we are Democrats\". </p> <p>\"That is a bad way to vote.

  "<p>Back in the late 18th century a chess-playing automaton, known only as \"The Turk\", toured the courts of Europe with its creator, beating all who dared to challenge it. The Turk's victims included such legendarily bad losers as Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin. Naturally, rumours of foul play, dwarves in the mechanism and witchcraft abounded. But no one could ever prove anything and though the contraption was eventually destroyed, the debate about whether machines could be smarter than man has continued to this day. </p> <p>Today we all seem convinced that machines are way cool, cooler certainly than chess, which isn't difficult. The ancient game has been maligned by a nerdish image, an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and now even its one-time poster boy, Bobby Fischer, lies ranting in prison in Japan. What better time then to re-establish chess as among the noblest of human endeavours, and possibly the only barrier to a Terminator-style future in which we do not figure at all? </p> <p>Though such grandiose fears of Armageddon were probably not its intention, such were the thoughts that gripped me having watched <strong> Game Over: Kasparov And The Machine </strong> (Tue, 9pm, BBC4). Before terrestrial viewers panic that they will have to invite yet more technology into their homes in order to heed this warning from history I would hazard that so much money was spent making this film that its appearance on BBC2 is only weeks away. </p> <p>The film concerns itself with the amiable yet utterly neurotic (like a Russian Woody Allen) Garry Kasparov's 1997 battle with IBM's chess \"super computer\" Deep Blue and the gang of dry nerds that control it. Having kicked its metal ass in 1996, Kasparov offered a rematch. Deep Blue returned capable of mapping 200 million positions a second and programmed \"to kill Kasparov at all costs\". Which it just about did. This prompted Garry to allege that, like its 18th-century forbear, the machine was not all it seemed and the nerds to counterclaim that Garry is nothing more than a moody Russian gnome who knows nothing of contemporary technology. And they still won't give him a rematch. </p> <p>This then is chess not as some dusty after-school refuge for those too weak for sport but chess as the battle for humanity's soul. Take it from me, your lack of interest in the game need not hinder your enjoyment of this any more than your inability to box should hamper your enjoyment of Raging Bull. And this has a lot less swearing. </p> <p>And so, inevitably, we move from documentary television at its finest to another primetime show about breasts. But this time with a twist. <strong> Boys With Breasts </strong> (Wed, 9pm, C4) is about... well you've figured it out already. But wait a minute, these are not merely the kind of obese accessory known in prisons as \"bitch tits\"; these are the real things, bestowed on their sufferers by a condition known as gynaecomastia. Some love them, most hate them, some even lactate, but all are here to behold. To elevate the programme from accusations of mere carnival leering we are invited to follow the progress of sufferers through their \"hidden world\" as they invoke all surgery's power to set them back on the road to masculinity, with uneven results. </p> <p>More interesting than mere suffering though are those who enjoy their condition. Such as John who once contemplated cutting his off with a knife but now shops merrily for 50DD bras and Lactating Ken (possibly a best-selling toy of the future) who - wait for it - milks his condition for all that it's worth. John and Ken, it goes without saying, live in California. On the less ludicrous streets of Britain the affliction is harder to mask. Here people shout \"tit boy\" at you and you end up spending lots of time at home. Though not life-threatening in the medical sense, the disease has its drawbacks. And so it transpires that coping with gynaecomastia is more a matter of self-esteem than self-preservation. Now, if we can just get machines to start taking the piss out of each other, and spend less time mocking ourselves, that would really be progress.</p>",

  "<p>Jose Mourinho's route to managerial stardom via teaching PE may be unconventional but it is not unique. Liverpool's manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez did a degree in PE in Madrid in the early 80s and taught football at university in the United States in 1990. Mourinho's assistant at Chelsea, Baltemar Brito, also began his career teaching. </p> <p>Top-level sport is awash with former PE teachers who have seemlessly transferred coaching skills from the classroom to elite competition. Many believe the practical knowledge gained during teacher-training provides invaluable experience when structuring training sessions and coaching new skills. </p> <p>Max Jones, performance director for UK Athletics, was head of PE at a Teesside secondary school for five years in the early 70s. \"When I trained as a teacher, it was the old system of a diploma in education, which meant 50% of your time was devoted to the practical teaching of a variety of sports,\" Jones says, adding that these days a bachelor of education degree is much more theory-based. \"You cut your teeth with children of all abilities, so you left college with a tremendous background. That has been of enormous benefit in my coaching.\" </p> <p>Many of Britain's Olympic successes can be traced to the guidance of former teachers. In swimming, the former British coach Terry Denison steered Adrian Moorhouse to gold in 1988. In athletics, there have been Tom McNab and Wilf Paish, coach to Peter Elliott, Tessa Sanderson and Mick Hill. </p> <p>Darrell Bunn, national heptathlon coach who is also head of PE at a Birmingham sports college, believes Mourinho probably draws on his teaching experience every day. </p> <p>\"One of the key qualities of coaching is observational skill,\" Bunn says. \"As a teacher you learn to watch and analyse skills. You segment techniques like throwing, running and kicking. This is just as relevant when coaching an Olympic athlete or a professional footballer.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez last night denied that Michael Owen was forced to leave Anfield while suggesting that the England striker's agent had engineered the move to Real Madrid behind Liverpool's back. </p> <p>Owen passed a medical in Madrid last night before completing the formalities of his transfer to Real, with Liverpool receiving a fee of \u00a38m and the right-sided midfielder Antonio N\u00fa\u00f1ez in return. The 24-year-old is to be unveiled at the Bernab\u00e9u at a press conference today, though the role played by his agent Tony Stephens has left Liverpool's new manager smouldering back on Merseyside. </p> <p>\"To suggest that we didn't want Michael and he was not happy here is untrue,\" said Ben\u00edtez, who will take charge of his first Premiership match at Tottenham this lunchtime. \"Michael was very happy when I spoke with him last week and we wanted him to stay, but the club had been waiting for a year already when I arrived for him to sign a new contract. Two months later he still had not signed. </p> <p>\"The problem is Real were aware of that too and talked with his agent and the player, and then everything changed. I'm sure the club talked about the contract and tried to sign him up, but sometimes you can't control it. </p> <p>\"It's down to the agents. In football now, the agent controls many situations. I knew Michael was a wonderful player and I have no doubts he still is, but the situation changed as soon as Real came in. Then the situation was difficult to control, and bad for us.\" </p> <p>Asked whether he thought Stephens, of SFX, had been negotiating with Real behind Liverpool's back, the Spaniard responded pointedly: \"You'll have to ask the agent that.\" </p> <p>Stephens returned to work after a protracted sabbatical only in spring, by which time Liverpool's offer of a new deal for the England striker had effectively been on the table for eight months. Talks failed to reach agreement, with Owen happy to move on once Real's interest surfaced. </p> <p>The loss of England's premier striker represents a worrying start to the Ben\u00edtez era, though the Spaniard intends to use the \u00a38m fee to strengthen his squad. Barcelona's Luis Garc\u00eda is expected to move to Anfield for \u00a36m but Ben\u00edtez will face competition, ironically from Madrid, for Real Sociedad's Xabi Alonso after the collapse of Patrick Vieira's move to the Bernab\u00e9u. The Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez contacted the Basque club yesterday to re-register their interest in the midfielder, though their \u00a36m bid falls short of Real Sociedad's \u00a310m valuation. </p> <p>The new recruits will have to impress quickly if Ben\u00edtez is to make the desired impact, though there was defiance yesterday from the manager in the face of a difficult start at the club. \"When a big club like Liverpool changes manager it is because something isn't right,\" said Ben\u00edtez, who was forced to sell his midfielder Gaizka Mendieta to Lazio on taking up the reins at Valencia in 2001. \"It is because things need to change. </p> <p>\"You never enjoy seeing good players leave, but my job is to make decisions like that. People should judge me at the end of the season. </p> <p>\"I'm not afraid. All teams around the world lose important players. You have to look to the future. We have the opportunity to try and balance the team. The supporters should know we have done the best for the club. There'll hopefully be good news for them next week. We can be a stronger team.\" </p> <p>N\u00fa\u00f1ez will provide balance and bite on the right side of midfield, an area weakened by the sale of Danny Murphy to Charlton, with the Spaniard, 25, expected on Merseyside on Monday to undergo a medical. Though Liverpool's first choice as a makeweight in the Owen deal would have been the teenager Juanfran, Ben\u00edtez is confident N\u00fa\u00f1ez can flourish here and was quick to reject suggestions that David Beckham - or any of the gal\u00e1cticos - had been offered by Madrid. </p> <p>\"Right midfield was our priority,\" added Ben\u00edtez. \"Juanfran would have been difficult to sign, but N\u00fa\u00f1ez was one of our first choices. He can run with the ball down that side, get to the line and he's good in the air. He'll be a good signing. </p> <p>N\u00fa\u00f1ez himself said: 'I'm still stunned, even though I knew about Liverpool's interest last week. I'm going there to be a first-team regular and to win important trophies.\" </p> <p>Of Owen, Ben\u00edtez said: \"I think Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho will be happy with Michael and the strikers he has now. Which one to pick is a good problem to have. It will be difficult for Michael to get into the starting line-up. It's always difficult when you change your country, language, team. But he has an advantage because he is a good player. He can talk on the field.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Suzete Frasquilho</strong><br> Jose Mourinho's primary school teacher, now 71 years old </p> <p> He was a very playful child, but when things got serious he would follow every rule. I can still see that six-year-old boy every time I watch him on television. Some say he's arrogant, but I don't see things that way: he's ambitious and he knows exactly what he wants. </p> <p><strong> Maria Joao Carvalho</strong><br> A pupil at Bela Vista high school in Setubal when he taught PE there in 1987 </p> <p> He was 24 and most of the class were 17-year-old-girls. We found him cute but he never cared about that. He was very strict, kept a tight rein on our behaviour, and kept a big distance from us. </p> <p>He would sometimes tell jokes but they were always about the exercises he had told us to do. </p> <p>Nowadays I think he is more bitter than he used to be. I feel he wants to show himself in a very arrogant and cold way. </p> <p>But I do like him: he's a great man and he takes his job very seriously. I'm not surprised that he's been successful and I believe he will be even more successful at Chelsea. </p> <p><strong> Felix Mourinho</strong><br> Father who introduced him to football and former coach of Vitoria Setubal </p> <p> Jose always wanted to be a coach. At the age of 15 or 16 he started to make reports about my opponents. When I was at Uniao Madeira we had a very important match that we needed to draw. He followed the opponents for a week and brought me full information about the way they played, the way they attacked and defended. The match ended 0-0. His mother Maria Julia would check the reports for spelling mistakes. </p> <p><strong> Manuel Fernandes</strong><br> Former Portuguese international, now 53, who was head coach at Vitoria Setubal when a 26-year-old Mourinho was in charge of the club's youth team. Now in charge of Penafiel </p> <p> I took him with me to Estrela Amadora because I saw he had a good sense of leadership and great methods. He took notes on everything we did on the training sessions and he liked to learn. During the matches he was always standing very excited - I had to tell him to calm down a lot of times. </p> <p>When I joined Bobby Robson at Sporting Lisbon in 1992 I took Jose with me again and he became Robson's translator. </p> <p>Everybody learns with the persons they have worked with. Jose was lucky to work with some of the best, like Robson or Louis van Gaal [at Barcelona], but he is much more than that: he managed to put his touch everywhere he passed. </p> <p>I've seen Chelsea playing this pre-season and all I can say is that he's building a team in his own image: very competitive. He will definitely be successful. </p> <p><strong> Oscar Garc\u00eda</strong><br> Midfielder at Barcelona when Mourinho moved there with Robson in 1996. Now at Espanyol </p> <p> I'm really not surprised that Jose has done so well as manager. I know he was officially Bobby Robson's translator at Barcelona but I never, ever saw him like that. I saw him much more as the second coach: he didn't just translate things and leave it at that. </p> <p>He had enthusiasm and talked about football all the time - and you could see that he really knew what he was talking about. His knowledge shone through. It was obvious he had something extra. </p> <p>He came to Barcelona and immediately got on very well with all the coaches at the club, not just Robson. He connected with people straight away. There was an eagerness about him; he wasn't going to settle with what he had: he had a real urge - an itch, in fact - to learn, to broaden his understanding of football. He was intelligent, listened and took things on board. And he acquired excellent knowledge from good coaches - Robson and Louis van Gaal. He also had a strong personality and was very focused, very clear. </p> <p>Mourinho was a channel, a bridge between the players and Robson, who didn't speak any Spanish. But it wasn't just about the language; his role was about communicating more than just what was said. And, no, we didn't see him as a spy - for us he wasn't the translator, he was a coach. </p> <p>I speak a bit of English, so in the dressing room I knew that when Robson said something to us the translations Mourinho came up with weren't literal, that's for sure. It was Robson plus a bit of Mourinho. He added his own observations - and they made sense. </p> <p><strong> Jose Capristano</strong><br> Benfica's vice-chairman, 58, who hired Mourinho to his first head coaching role </p> <p> He's a genius. That man was born to be a coach - he's a brilliant manager who thinks football 24 hours a day. His huge success is not a surprise for me. I've worked in Benfica for 14 years, been on four different boards, and I have never met someone like him. I wanted him to stay at Benfica for the rest of his life. </p> <p>Mourinho made all the difference in the way he handled the dressing room. He treated every player as if he was his father: he would punish them when he had to, but he would also protect them from everything. </p> <p>Two things are certain at Stamford Bridge - Jose will be very successful and the Portuguese players will have the same treatment as the others. </p> <p><strong> Vitor Pontes</strong><br> Uniao Leiria's goalkeeping coach when Mourinho joined as head coach in June 2001. Now Leiria's head coach </p> <p> Those who work better get closer to success. One of Mourinho's biggest assets is the way he uses mind games. Before each match he would show the players newspapers with opponents' words to provoke a reaction in them. </p> <p>I said in the past that he would quickly get to the top. But it was hard to predict such a meteoric rise. I believe he will continue to prove at Chelsea that he is one of the best in the world. </p> <p><strong> Tiago Pereira</strong><br> Defensive midfielder, 29, who moved with Mourinho to Porto in 2002. Now plays for Boavista </p> <p> He is a modern coach and knows exactly how to motivate players. He is very honest and treats everybody the same way. And he would make us believe that we were the best. </p> <p>It's true he reminds the players of some of the opponents' words to motivate them but I think his biggest asset is the way he prepares every match. Before each game, Jose showed us videotapes with free-kicks, corners, individual moves and all the details of the other team. </p> <p>Things won't be easy for him at Chelsea, because he's still building a team. But I think he has everything to win in England as he did in Portugal. </p> <p><strong> John Terry </strong><br> Chelsea captain </p> <p> I think at the minute the manager has faith in us and us in him so why can't we win the league? You notice immediately his man-management of every player. He has sat down with all of us to talk things through. </p> <p>Tactically he is spot on and on the training pitch he has had a great response from everyone but he certainly tells us if he is not happy and if you make a mistake in training he's on your case and lets you know. One time one of the defenders was left the last man against Didier Drogba and Jose stopped the session and shouted: 'Don't fuck about.' </p> <p>We have stepped up another level, that standard is up and it has made us a better team with Jose. </p> <p>If he rotates the squad there will be the disappointment of not playing because you want to play every minute of every game, but everyone understands the role everyone has at the club and there won't be any sulking. </p> <p>Jose wants a good relationship with every player. He understands players. There are certainly no little groups or cliques. </p> <p>Players come from all over the world but there's no English group or Portuguese group. They are all in this together. The lads get on really well in training and socialising outside.

  "<p>Chelsea may well be presented with something better than a commemorative clock to mark their centenary. In 2005, 50 years after their sole league title, the club could be champions once again. Any optimism over their prospects can soar because, of course, it is not weighed down by evidence. A reshaped side will play Manchester United tomorrow with only a few friendly results to proffer as credentials. </p> <p>At this fanciful stage, a team with hardly any prior history is to be envied. It will take a long time before some minor flaw or mannerism in, say, Didier Drogba starts to be as annoying as a piece of grit in your shoe. For the moment there is no chagrin to rack Chelsea, no schadenfreude over which rivals can smack their lips. Even if they are a side without an identity yet, everything is fresh at Stamford Bridge. </p> <p>No other club with pretensions to winning the Premiership can make that claim. Even with the arrival of the highly adept Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the proceeds from the sale of Michael Owen would have to stretch an unfeasibly long way if the face of an unsuccessful Liverpool line-up were to be altered overnight. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is free of such troubles, but, eight years into the job, he still has to live with the grind of putting his wits and his nerves to the challenge of scooping more honours for Arsenal. </p> <p>Ceaseless ambition can bring about a kind of repetitive strain injury. In some managers the habit of striving persists but there is only an ache in the mind where there used to be supple ideas. Few have staved off that syndrome for as long as Sir Alex Ferguson. He still visualises another bout of rejuvenation for Manchester United and, in the process, for himself. You wonder, all the same, if his attention wanders to Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge. </p> <p>They are adversaries all right. The newcomer floored United in the European Cup while with Porto and is presently jabbing well in the verbal sparring. Ferguson went to the visitors' dressing room to congratulate Mourinho after United were knocked out by the Portuguese champions in March. He would love to make this new foe practise his rusty skills as a gracious loser, but Ferguson must also look at him with a wistful recognition. </p> <p>Mourinho became famous, at 41, by claiming the European Cup for Porto this year. The Scot, as it happens, was the same age when he vaulted into the top flight of managers by guiding Aberdeen to victory over Real Madrid in the 1983 Cup Winners' Cup final. The parallels in background reach further than that. Ferguson was not as bad a footballer as Mourinho, who barely claims ever to have been a professional at all, but neither will have felt sated when they had to leave a pitch for the last time. </p> <p>Even if the Scot was never as bombastic as the new Chelsea manager, he was in the grip of the same urge to impress himself on the world when he was exhibiting a hyperactive aggression. Ferguson may become nostalgic as he sees Mourinho making a beginning in England with a surfeit of skilful footballers and the wherewithal to buy more of them in due course. </p> <p>The Chelsea project may not advance smoothly from the very start. Mourinho has put the accent on players who are still to fulfil themselves, but some are unproven in this country at least and casualties are to be expected along the way. Even so, there must be relish at Stamford Bridge over this new-minted venture. Manchester United and Arsenal are in a very different phase of the cycle. </p> <p>Ferguson's well-catalogued worries over players who are missing for various reasons have frustrated him just when he wanted to regroup after last season's third-place finish. United will not have despaired of retrieving the Premiership trophy, but a lot will depend on how well they pick their way along a rocky path in the next month or two. At Highbury, Wenger could brood on whether a largely unchanged squad is, paradoxically, an obstacle to repeating last season's standards. Fresh impetus will have to come from other sources, and players returning from Euro 2004 are yet to regain peak condition. </p> <p>There are concerns to be addressed at both Arsenal and United, but their managers would not expect anything else. The league programme is often about the struggle to hold on to status. For Iain Dowie, Nigel Worthington and Gary Megson, the stress of sustaining their teams carries a faint echo of life at Old Trafford or Highbury. The first two, directing Crystal Palace and Norwich, are more disadvantaged than Megson, who has been in the Premiership before and comes back to it with a squad enhanced by signings. </p> <p>None the less, the fixture list will be gruelling for almost everyone. In 2002, the football world doted on David Moyes, but last season's points total would have seen Everton relegated in other years and harvesting wins will be even more awkward at a club throttled by boardroom conflict. </p> <p>Though the Premiership may lack sophistication, it retains interest with its refusal to accommodate complacency. From Paul Sturrock, attempting to secure his position in his first full season at Southampton, to the septuagenarian Sir Bobby Robson, with a last attempt to bring a trophy to Newcastle United, there are only preoccupied characters on this scene. </p> <p>Some are approaching subtler tests. Having received funds, Steve Bruce and Steve McClaren are supposed to improve on already healthy circumstances at Birmingham and Middlesbrough. Bolton Wanderers and Fulham must not not slither back towards the relegation area. David O'Leary has to live with a standard set by putting Aston Villa in the top six. Many managerial brows are about to crinkle and we, too, should be absorbed.</p>",
  "<p>The Premiership is back like an old novel with a new dustjacket. Turn a page or two and a familiar plot will no doubt be revealed. The leading characters will surely be the same, the fall guys will be wearing different shirts but will display similar inadequacies and the rest will be much of the usual muchness with everybody good, bad or indifferent according to how they feel on the day. </p> <p>Such uncertainties as there are will mainly concern the degrees of purple turned by Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager of Manchester United, the amount of blind spots suffered on the Arsenal bench by his principal rival, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and the number of referees slagged off by Graeme Souness, Sam Allardyce and the rest of the Ron Knees. </p> <p>Again Chelsea are providing the most significant innovation, having replaced as their head coach a tinkering man with a trumpeting man. Yet Chelsea's annual clear-out is itself in danger of becoming a cliche. What price Jose Mourinho's future at Stamford Bridge if he looks like doing no better than Claudio Ranieri? </p> <p>It is difficult to avoid the feeling that Roman Abramovich, whose Russian gushers began to drench Chelsea in black gold just over a year ago, desperately needs a trophy or two on board before President Putin gets out of bed the wrong side and casts around for more oligarchic assets to freeze. </p> <p>The Champions League has usurped the FA Cup as the English season's most attractive diversion although even that went off the boil last time once Arsenal had flopped against Chelsea, who then did the same against Monaco. The reality is that unless United get going again the trophy will remain abroad. </p> <p>There will presumably be off-the-field incidents to hog the headlines. The first half of last season became preoccupied with the saga of Rio Ferdinand's non-appearance for a drugs test but it seems safe to assume the chances of Ferdinand again going shopping when he should have been testing are marginally more remote than, say, Sven-Goran Eriksson going on getting involved in goings-on. </p> <p>The Premiership plot could do with a new twist and some new ideas, or even old ideas, revived. Apart from World Cup qualifiers, the clubs have the field to themselves until Germany 2006 and the domestic game urgently needs a dust-down after the latest of England's biennial failures. </p> <p>Euro 2004 may not have been the final word in excellence and, like the last World Cup, was let down by its bigger names. Yet the further Greece progressed the more intriguing the story became. Foinavon was reborn. </p> <p>Defending in English football has become sloppy. Maybe defences still find it hard to cope with the revised interpretations of the offside law. They can no longer push up confident that opponents straying into offside positions will automatically be flagged. </p> <p>Goals in the Premiership are cheaper, with attackers being allowed to come from offside positions to score. Teams need to be reminded of the basics and compulsive viewing of the way Otto Rehhagel's Greeks organised themselves at the back would surely not come amiss. </p> <p>To say Michalis Kapsis and Traianos Dellas worked like Trojans at the heart of the defence is not a twist of ancient history but an appreciation of how discipline and concentration by an unfancied team can still thwart supposedly superior opponents. </p> <p>In the Euro 2004 final Greece beat Portugal partly because they curbed the threat of the wingers Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo. For some coaches this was further proof of the winger as a luxury item yet the evidence of earlier games suggested traditional wing play was undergoing a revival. </p> <p>Ronaldo and, fitfully, Figo along with Karel Poborsky and Arjen Robben, now at Chelsea, recalled a time when wingers were outside-rights and lefts rather than wing-backs or wide midfielders. Football fashion oftens goes in circles and perhaps wingers are in vogue again. </p> <p>New Premiership winners are unlikely. Liverpool, even under new foreign management, do not appear to have the quality to do more than finish a better fourth than they did last season. </p> <p>Newcastle, by signing the erratic Patrick Kluivert, have guaranteed themselves headlines. Bobby Robson has been knighted but Kluivert could leave him looking benighted, which would be a shame.</p>",
  "<p>Down a steep, but thankfully not drop-edged, path and through a large white gate that we locked behind us ... we had arrived at St Anthony Head, our very own lighthouse (at least for a while). The light towered above Sally Port, the keeper's cottage where we would stay, and its small white outbuildings nestled around us. Ahead the sea stretched out to the horizon. </p> <p>A bottle of wine and a hamper of food sat on the kitchen table, and fluffy towels lay on the pristine white beds. The keeper's cottage was opened this year for holiday lets after being very comfortably refurbished. The decor is fresh and airy, modern but not out of keeping. </p> <p>St Anthony's Lighthouse, built in 1835, guides ships into Falmouth harbour as well as warning ships off the treacherous Manacle Rocks. Lighthouses have not always been popular in Cornwall. The first were regarded as unfair interference in the living the locals made from plundering wrecks. An old Cornish prayer used to ask, \"Lord send us a mild winter or a good wreck.\" </p> <p>Trinity House, the lighthouse authority for England and Wales since 1514, completed the automation of its lighthouses in 1998, leaving the keepers' cottages redundant. Their future, and the best hope of maintaining them and their heritage, now lies with tourism. More cottages - and at least one redundant light tower itself - will open this year and in 2005. </p> <p>Most lighthouses are in secluded spots, and privacy at St Anthony's is almost total. There are no neighbours (bar the cormorants and shags on the rock below), and nothing overlooking it but the cliffs. It is not as remote as when it was built, however. So difficult was land access then that the stones for the lighthouse were all cut and shaped in Penzance and brought to St Anthony's by boat. Today, our car is parked in a National Trust car park three minutes away, and a network of public footpaths leads from the lighthouse gate around the cliffs of the headland to an old gun battery, a bird-hide looking out on to a cliff-side (with nesting cormorants), and down to a small, very pleasant and little-used swimming beach with a couple of good caves. </p> <p>The peninsula is a haven for walkers and peace-seekers, a far cry from commercialised Cornwall further along the coast. The paths are edged with rich vegetation opening out now and then to reveal marvellous views out to sea, across the estuary to Falmouth and over the river to St Mawes - reachable by passenger ferry from Place (yes, really), a 40-minute walk from the lighthouse. </p> <p>If you become inspired to find out more about lighthouses, there is the Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum in Penzance (01736 360077, <a href=\"http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk\">trinityhouse.co.uk</a>) with a very enthusiastic curator. And The Lizard Lighthouse - on the most southerly point of mainland Britain (under an hour's drive from St Anthony's) - reopens to the public after refurbishment in spring 2005. One or two of its keepers' cottages are also expected to open as holiday accommodation (under the same management as St Anthony's). </p> <p>Back at \"our\" lighthouse, the evening was not quite warm enough to sit out on the patio so we settled into the extra sitting room, a small separate building with a picture window looking straight out to sea (and a round table perfect for playing cards). </p> <p>The window is made of reinforced glass to cope with storm spray, but we didn't experience any storms. We did, however, have fog. Outside, the foghorn boomed, but inside the cottage - where the bedrooms are double-glazed - we became almost attached to its regular hooting and none of us needed the ear-plugs that had been thoughtfully provided. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Sally Port, St Anthony Head Lighthouse, Roseland Peninsula, Cornwall, sleeps four (no children under 14) and costs \u00a3492-\u00a3932 per week from Rural Retreats (01386 701177, <a href=\"http://www.ruralretreats.co.uk\">ruralretreats.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Further information:</strong><br> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lighthouse-visits.co.uk\">lighthouse-visits.co.uk</a>. <a href=\"http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk\">trinityhouse.co.uk</a>. <a href=\"http://www.alk.org.uk\">alk.org.uk</a> has information on International Lighthouse Day, August 22 (click on 'events').

  "<p><strong>Stumps: England 233-5 (Thorpe 89, Hoggard 3)</strong> I know it's over, still I cling...A good day for West Indies, a long day for me, and a lazy Saturday for everyone else. Thank you and goodnight. Here's Phil Keegan to finish: \"I once read that when a girl invites you back to her flat for the first time, the first thing you should do is check her record collection, and if she's got any Phil Collins you need to get the hell out of there fast. Sound advice I reckon. But then again I think the best album of all time is Crime of the Century by Supertramp....\"</p> <p><strong>78th over ONLY ONE OVER TO GO NOW! England 233-5 (Thorpe 89, Hoggard 3)</strong> \"Seeing as you're going to Rochester, how about: 'Every day is like Sunday' by Morrissey,\" offers Laura Wilson. \"Just change the lyrics to 'this Medway town that they forgot to close down'.\" Very good, I like it. Alas I haven't uploaded it yet, but I could listen to that famous Morrissey jangle-fest: 'The Last Of The Famous International Barmaids Called Danielle'.</p> <p><strong>77th over England 232-5 (Thorpe 88, Hoggard 3)</strong> \"All this talk of amber nectar is beginning to irritate me,\" fumes Alex Martin. Thee and me both, pal. \"The lager in this part of the world is so poor that I've had to turn to the local equivalent for a little solace. Hence, with no cable, no Channel 4 and - most sadly of all - no Charlize, I'm reading your prose from the discomfort of my sofa, supping champagne and wishing I were in Farringdon. C'mon Thorpie, 'tis time to avenge Freddie with a cross-channel missile.\"</p> <p><strong>76th over England 231-5 (Thorpe 87, Hoggard 3)</strong> Three more overs to go now before I can slip on the iPod for the long journey back to Rochester. Any suggestions as to what I should soothe my ears with? I'm thinking Libertines, Explosions In The Sky, or Phil Collins and Phil Bailey.</p> <p><strong>75th over England 229-5 (Thorpe 87, Hoggard 1)</strong> Mohammed and Bravo have worked well in tandem here, wresting back the initiative at a time when the West Indies' hopes looked to be going down the pan like Toilet Duck. England are understandably playing for the close now.</p> <p><strong>74th over England 227-5 (Thorpe 86, Hoggard 0)</strong> \"I've been having quite the sporting afternoon here in Dubai,\" says Stephen Davenport, \"reading your commentary while listening to Stockport County hose Blackpool 4-0 on t'Internet, keeping half an ear on TMS on the dial up-line in another room, watching Villa play Southampton, and taking the odd shufti at the Olympics, all on top of one hour's sleep and a 14-hour day. So remind me - did Strauss get bowled for 90, score County's third, referee the Villa game, or win the 50m butterfly?\" None of the above, but he did get in a jacuzzi with the Hollyoaks girls disguised as an intrepid over-by-over hack. Keep up, Stephen. </p> <p><strong>WICKET! England 227-5 (Flintoff lbw b Bravo 7)</strong> Poor decision from the usually excellent Simon Taufel, who triggers Freddie lbw to a ball from Bravo that angled in and was going down leg. It wasn't an absolute shocker, but given that it deprived me (and you) of the only possible entertainment we'd have got for the rest of the day, I'm not the happiest bunny in Farringdon. </p> <p><strong>73rd over England 227-4 (Thorpe 86, Flintoff 7)</strong> Flintoff hacks Mohammed to third man for two, then drives lazily to long-off for one. The day's play is winding down like a tired hack after sending a teatime email. </p> <p><strong>72nd over England 224-4 (Thorpe 86, Flintoff 4)</strong> Bravo beats Thorpe twice outside off, and here's Ian Simons: \"Well, as I cannot help you get home more quickly, all there remains to say is that by 7.15 I shall be in Headingley, supping cold lager myself. Sorry.\" Oh you will be.</p> <p><strong>71st over England 224-4 (Thorpe 86, Flintoff 4)</strong> Mohammed to Flintoff, and the first ball is driving elegantly through extra-cover for four. Shot, Frederick!</p> <p><strong>70th over England 219-4 (Thorpe 85, Flintoff 0)</strong> Bravo greets Flintoff with a slower ball, the same delivery that nailed him after his brutal innings at Edgbaston. A maiden.</p> <p><strong>68th over England 219-4 (Thorpe 85, Flintoff 0)</strong> Mohammed v Flintoff could be an interesting contest, to say the least. For now, Thorpe takes strike and late-cuts cleverly for two.</p> <p><strong>68th over England 217-4 (Thorpe 83, Flintoff 0)</strong> The scoreboard has ground to a halt, a bit like John Carpenter's directorial career. \"What's all this nonsense about Rochester?\" thunders Laura Wilson. \"If you're in Farringdon, head for the Three Kings off Clerkenwell Green. Fairly cheap, nice barstaff, decent crowd. None of that Kent ponceyness...\" Yes, but <em>nice</em> isn't <em>cute and Welsh called Danielle with a nice nu-mullet</em> is it? Besides, Farringdon is <em>sooooo</em> Friday night.</p> <p><strong>WICKET! Strauss b Bravo 90 (217-4)</strong> Very well bowled by Dwayne Bravo. He bottled it up along with Mohammed, and Strauss got more and more frustrated. First he wafted at a wide one and, next ball - driving again with no foot movement - he dragged on via the pad. A frustrating end to a very determined innings, and another sign of the nous that underpins so much of Bravo's work, even at the age of 20. Like a scenario involving nothing other than ten bottles of champagne, a jacuzzi, the Hollyoaks girls and an intrepid over-by-over reporter, Bravo is seriously promising.</p> <p><strong>67th over England 217-3 (Strauss 90, Thorpe 83)</strong> Little happens, but Geoff Boycott makes a brilliant hash of a simple 'England douse West Indian fire' analogy, sounding about as comfortable as Sir Alex Ferguson being forced to say 'I love Jose Mourinho'.</p> <p><strong>66th over England 217-3 (Strauss 90, Thorpe 83)</strong> Thorpe, quietly, has had a terrific summer: 3, 51*, 34, 45, 104*, 19, 38, 61, 54 and now 83*. England are getting 'em in singles at the moment.</p> <p><strong>65th over England 216-3 (Strauss 90, Thorpe 82)</strong> With his pencil-thin tache and rat-like scowl, Mohammed looks like a villain in an Agatha Christie story, but England haven't had any trouble solving his brand of mystery (spin). Sorry. \"That's the beauty of the t'internet,\" says Ian Simons. \"I can do it sat on my bot in the office here in Leeds.\" Alas not, my friend. Not with our system. Do you think I'd be in Farringdon otherwise?</p> <p><strong>64th over England 215-3 (Strauss 90, Thorpe 81)</strong> Strauss deflects Bravo to fine leg to move into the 90s. I'm not nervous, and I doubt he is either - a century looks as inevitable as a fistfight on Rochester High Street on a Saturday night. An event to which I'll no longer be a witness, what with the cricket going on till midnight.</p> <p><strong>63rd over England 213-3</strong> Mohammed has Thorpe reaching a long way from his crease and beats him outside off stump. \"Cold lager,\" says Ian Simons. \"You might still make it. Give me access to update your website, and you can knock off. It will give me something to do.\" With pleasure: how quickly can you be in Farringdon?</p> <p><strong>62nd over England 209-3 (Strauss 89, Thorpe 78)</strong> A boozy crowd is paying about as much attention to the cricket as Jeremy Paxman does to another person's opinion, but Strauss is ticking ever closer to his century. There is more than one way to skin a bowling attack, and he has shown that today with a mentally-tough, singles-laden knock.</p> <p><strong>61st over England 206-3</strong> We've gained some overs somewhere, but either way England are flying now. Strauss is set for a third century in only six Tests and Thorpe, having been let off by Sarwan, is playing beautifully. And Rob's done one, leaving me to wonder what became of my grand plan to be supping cold lager in Rochester by 8.00.</p> <p><strong>57th over England 201-3 (Strauss 85, Thorpe 72)</strong> 22 overs left in the day after this one (lucky, lucky you) and Rob Smyth is about to relieve this supremely lucky correspondent for the rest of the day. Rich has a question: \"Anybody help us with one of the 2 following Cricket trivia q's?? We're looking for highest first class or test innings (indiv) without a single boundary, and also the highest innings ONLY of boundaries. Any ideas?? So far we're guessing the former to be around 70ish, possibly by a Pakistani in the 80s, and the later to be around 30 by some random guy lower in the order going all out for quick runs. Any ideas?\" </p> <p><strong>56th over England 197-3 (Strauss 80, Thorpe 72)</strong> Not for the first time, Mohammed has beaten both batsman and keeper alike, and the subsequent four byes bring up the 150-run partnership. The footmarks clearly the target for the left-arm unorthodox bowler, but Strauss rides his luck and scores on the off-side. </p> <p><strong>55th over England 189-3 (Strauss 78, Thorpe 71)</strong> It seems a long time ago now when England were 2-13 and on the rack after the loss of Robert Key. The partnership between Thorpe and Strauss now 149-runs, and building. Collymore has his radar right but there is a distinct lack of bite to his deliveries. </p> <p> <strong>54th over England 185-3 (Strauss 77, Thorpe 70)</strong> As if to stir the slumbering crowd, Thorpe has struck Mohammed for a six over midwicket, followed by a boundary in exactly the same place, and Ramnaresh Sarwan has just pulled the peak of his cap lower over his blushing visage. Thorpe is not far from over-taking Strauss, such is his scoring-rate. </p> <p> <strong>53rd over England 175-3 (Strauss 77, Thorpe 58)</strong> Luck has clearly deserted this West Indian side, Strauss surviving an under-edge that carried to the wicketkeeper on the bounce. Both batsmen currently trying to survive a sticky moment or two. Ian has finished watching The Seventh Samurai and has returned to make a clarification: \"I might have mentioned that I was working. I don't wish to perpetuate this rumour, merely to explain that a more accurate way of describing things would be to say that I was in the office. Any hardened set-theorists reading should be able to pinpoint the distinction. In fact, anyone that remembers GCSE maths should have no qualms.\"</p> <p><strong>52nd over England 173-3 (Strauss 75, Thorpe 58)</strong> Can you believe it? Ramnaresh Sarwan has dropped Thorpe at point in what must go down as a sitter at this level. Thorpe slashed at a wide ball and succeeded only in looping a swirling ball to Sarwan who moved with all the mobility of a glacier to drop it cold. </p> <p><strong>51st over England 171-3 (Strauss 74, Thorpe 57)</strong> Lara has also kept Collymore on after the drinks break, but blind faith has its limits, so he runs over to him and points out the whereabouts of the three sticks in the ground some 22-yards away and relates their importance. Collymore responds with a maiden as he drills around Strauss's off-stump. Laura's back, and she has company: \"To be fair, you do have another reader. My cat, Morrissey, is reading and is rather enjoying it, though lamenting the lack of cat-based cricket news. He's also rather disappointed that Spurs only managed a draw ...\"</p> <p><strong>50th over England 171-3 (Strauss 75, Thorpe 57)</strong> Mohammed has obviously impressed at least one person watching him, as Lara has tossed him the ball to bowl again. Strauss, licking his lips, square drives him for four, and then hands Thorpe the strike to do his utmost. Paul has also joined us and starts his contribution with what is clearly a rhetorical question: \"Are you not depressed that there are another 30+ overs before you can go and get a drink (by which time Newcastle - Boro will be over as well)? I might be enjoying the coverage with a nice bottle of Shiraz, but my wife is watching the Thai equivalent of Big Brother and Pop Idol in one mightmare format, so I guess we are about even.\" My condolences go out to you ...</p> <p> <strong>49th over England 166-3 (Strauss 70, Thorpe 57)</strong> Change of bowling and Corey Collymore is thrown the cherry. First ball? Square cut for four by Strauss. Collymore soon follows it up with a no-ball that is pulled over the keeper's head, without great control, for a boundary to bring up Thorpe's 50. Two balls later, and Collymore foolishly strays on Thorpe's pads and he is whipped away for four more. 14 off the over and drinks are called. Lara has the touch of lead at the moment with his bowling changes. </p> <p> <strong>48th over England 152-3 (Strauss 65, Thorpe 49)</strong> Strauss fends away a couple of venomous deliveries from Bravo, and then rocks on to the backfoot and violently pulls one away for a mere single. Hardly worth the effort, really. Bravo responds with a slower ball that is cleverly disguised, but harmlessly watched through to the keeper. Rich from Kristianstad in Sweden is also with us: \"... another one stuck in the office all day with it gorgeous outside. But only just realised there was cricket on - sorry - assumed it was still rained off after yesterday.\" Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.</p> <p><strong>47th over England 151-3 (Strauss 64, Thorpe 49)</strong> Mohammed takes up the bowling cudgels once more and has an supremely optimistic LBW appeal turned down. The 150-run mark is reached for England. Meanwhile, James has a few words of praise for Strauss: \"Well done Andy Strauss: he's really grafted at this innings, and this is great to see - after he had seemingly the dream start to Test cricket, he's proven he can dig his heels in when it matters. This is very good news for England in the long-term. If Strauss can hang around when the going gets tough, he's the perfect partner to Marcus Trescothick.\"</p> <p><strong>46th over England 149-3 (Strauss 63, Thorpe 48)</strong> Mohammed applies the breaks to the scoring (the previous over), for how long no-one is sure. Dwayne Bravo bowls his second over of the session and Thorpe immediately gets on to the front foot. He's only a couple away from a well-deserved 50. Strauss scores two runs from a shot behind point that third man has to field. England looking very comfortable at this point in time.</p> <p><strong>45th over England 143-3 (Strauss 61, Thorpe 44)</strong> Hold the phone! We have another reader, purportedly, and he's telling me to stop moaning. \"I too am stuck in a lonely office,\" says Ian, \"but at least you get to watch the ball by ball cricket. You scoundrel. admittedly, I'm watching the Seven Samurai, which is a top class film. And you get to finish before me, I finish at 7. Furthermore, I can't have too heavy a night, as I'm working at 7 tomorrow morning. You've got it easy, you London types.\" Jeepers. Tough weekend.</p> <p> <strong>44th over England 142-3 (Strauss 60, Thorpe 44)</strong> A Strauss boundary has brought up the 100-run partnership between these two. Very commendable effort. I think I've run out of adjectives. Mohammed again is played particularly comfortably and Lara just cannot cut a break at the moment.</p> <p><strong>43rd over England 137-3 (Strauss 56, Thorpe 43)</strong> Edwards continues and bowls an over of full-ish balls that are treated with respect. He must be nearing the end of his spell and Lara will probably be considering his options. This coverage's solitary reader is back - Laura (all is forgiven, stick around) says: \"Aaaagh! It looks like Mr Taufel/Christian has been at the Gatting impersonators! I know that's probably not the point, but it's all too much for my addled brain ...\" A few drops of rain are sprinkling from ominous-looking storm clouds ... </p> <p> <strong>42nd over England 133-3 (Strauss 55, Thorpe 41)</strong> Strauss and wicketkeeper Carlton Baugh have both been beaten by a Mohammed delivery that stayed underground longer than an Iraqi tyrant in a spiderhole. Four byes. Strauss then caresses a classical backfoot drive to the boundary and Mohammed looks forlorn. Well he might.</p> <p><strong>41st over England 125-3 (Strauss 50, Thorpe 41)</strong> The volume of emails flowing in has been distinctly underwhelming: just the one - and it's from my accountant asking for a receipt. If i get (more) desperate I'll post it here. Is there anyone out there? All I can hear is the tapping echo of my keyboard reverberating in an empty office. </p> <p><strong>40th over England 120-3 (Strauss 50, Thorpe 37)</strong> Strauss brings up his fifty; a gritty effort, by all accounts, as he and Thorpe bleed Mohammed dry for six runs all around the wicket. The Windies are in desperate need of another strike bowler (he said, speaking the bleedin' obvious).</p> <p><strong>39th over England 114-3 (Strauss 48, Thorpe 33)</strong> Lion-hearted Edwards beats the dangling blade of Strauss with a sweet, sweet delivery. He's looking exasparated, is Edwards, and you have to think he looks the most likely to break this partnership. </p> <p><strong>38th over England 112-3 (Strauss 47, Thorpe 32)</strong> On Channel 4, Ian Bishop is banging on about how much is at stake for both teams and valuable this match is, as a nation snoozes in front of the box. 'Bring back the horse-racing', has been one of the more constructive emails I've received.</p> <p><strong>37th over England 110-3 (Strauss 47, Thorpe 30)</strong> Thorpe has edged a ball though slips, albeit on the ground, and Edwards's gaze burns holes in the shameful countenace of Sylvester Jospeh who failed to gather in the ball. A career-defining pull-shot from Thorpe earns him a couple and the hosts have reached three figures. Four overthrows from a quickly-scurried single does nothing to improve Edwards's temper, especially after a no-ball, and the over leaks 12 valuable runs for England. 85 more runs to avoid the follow-on.</p> <p><strong>36th over England 98-3 (Strauss 47, Thorpe 19)</strong> Mohammed is working his googly overtime but thus far, neither batsman is having trouble picking it. Tidy enough six balls - only a single from it. </p> <p> <strong>35th over England 97-3 (Strauss 47, Thorpe 18)</strong> Edwards is slashed over slips for a single, and Thorpe works a run off his hips, as Edwards starts to get into his rhythm. One bouncer was an absolute rip-snorter, but Strauss ducked underneath it comfortably. I wouldn't face Edwards even if I was allowed to wear an iron lung.</p> <p> <strong> 34th over England 95-3 (Strauss 46, Thorpe 17)</strong> David Mohammed bowls a couple of wrong-uns, and stares imperiously at Thorpe, moustache bristling, for daring to keep them out. Meanwhile, \"is it just me or does umpire Simon Taufel bear more than a passing resemblance to the scissor-happy, bed-hopping plastic surgeon, Christian, from new channel 4 series, Nip/Tuck? Maybe it's the Cuvee Prestige, but I do keep expecting him to whip out a scalpel and perform lipo on Rob Key,\" observes Laura. Not the most edifying thought to carry us through the afternoon.</p> <p><strong> 33rd over England 94-3 (Strauss 45, Thorpe 17)</strong> I have no idea what happened during this over as Channel 4's TV director decided to opt for an ad break after the second ball of Fidel Edwards's over. Not the greatest of praise for facing batsman Andrew Strauss. The ad wasn't much cop, either.</p> <p><strong> 32nd over England 93-3 (Strauss 44, Thorpe 17)</strong> Dave Mohammed takes up the attack after the 20-minute interval and the first ball is a rank full toss that Strauss tucks away for four through midwicket. Not a loosener so much as completely disjointed. He then beats England's opener with a jaffa and Strauss is almost stumped by first slip. Three more for Strauss completes the Jeckyl-and-Hyde nature of the over.</p> <p> <strong>Tea break: 31st over England 86-3 (Strauss 37, Thorpe 17)</strong> England are on the backfoot like a downhill Michael Jackson moonwalk on a slope covered in marbles. Or some such. Graham Thorpe and Andrew Strauss are conducting a form of fightback and the upcoming session looks to be crucial to the outcome of this Test. The Scarface pic is there purely because it's a brilliant flick, as well as the fact that the huge pile of sawdust currently at either Old Trafford end is the largest mound of white-ish powder I've seen since Tony Montana developed a fondness for jazz salt.</p>",
  "<p>The Olympic swimming finals got off to storming start when American Michael Phelps broke his own world record to claim gold in the 400metres individual medley, while Australia's Ian Thorpe just held off team-mate Grant Hackett to win gold in the 400m freestyle.</p> <p>Nineteen-year-old Phelps left his rivals trailing in his wake as he won in a time of four minutes and 08.26 seconds, shaving 15-hundredths of a second off the previous record which he set at the American trials in July. </p> <p>Fellow American Erik Vendt claimed the silver, finishing more than three seconds behind Phelps in 4mins 11.81secs, with Hungary's Laszlo Cseh clocking 4:12.15 to take the bronze.</p> <p>Phelps got off to quite a start in his quest to eclipse Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals at the 1972 Munich Games. The 19-year-old from Baltimore could get eight chances - five individual events and three relays. </p> <p>Phelps' first final was one of his surest bets. Last month, he improved his own world record at the U.S. trials - a time that was nearly four seconds faster than anyone else in the world this year coming into Athens. </p> <p>It was then the turn of Ian Thorpe to show that anything the American can do, he can do too, as he successfully defended his Olympic 400m freestyle crown, taking gold in a time of three minutes and 43.10 seconds. </p> <p>This time there was no repeat of the embarrassing false start which almost cost the 21-year-old Australian the chance to defend his title. </p> <p>Thorpe was disqualified at the Australian trials when he tumbled off the blocks before the gun had sounded and was only allowed to swim the event in Athens after his team-mate Craig Stevens surrendered his spot. </p> <p>Dressed in his familiar all-black swimsuit and yellow cap, Thorpe was in tears after only just holding off Aussie team-mate Grant Hackett who won silver with a time of 3:43.36. </p> <p>The bronze went to American Klete Keller in 3:44.11 - an Americas record.</p> <p>The first women's final saw Yana Klochkova of Ukraine live up to her top billing as she put in a gutsy display to successfully defend her 400m individual medley with a time of 4:34.83.</p> <p>The last swimming final of the day was won by Australia, who held off USA to claim gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay. Holland took bronze.</p>",

  "<p>The bird rose in the bright morning air like a tiny missile, its distinctive \"took-took\" call allowing us to pinpoint its roost in a small bush just a few feet from the edge of the water. There it was again - a steep vertical climb and a parachute-like hopping motion through the air before it buried itself in a bramble bush and was invisible once more. </p> <p>\"That's a male sedge warbler showing off,\" Tim Appleton whispered from his own perch, a bench inside the hide from where we were watching the display. A hundred yards away across the mirrored surface of the lagoon there was a long low bunker in which 300 small holes had been drilled to provide homes for sand martins. \"We call that the world's biggest nesting box,\" Tim said. \"It's been here four years and we only had two pairs that first summer. This year there are more than a hundred.\" </p> <p>Appleton, the manager at the Rutland Water Nature Reserve, is justifiably confident that his is the best inland birdwatching location in Britain. Not only have there been more than 250 bird species recorded here, but the giant lake is also home to one of only two pairs of breeding ospreys in England. </p> <p>Summer on Rutland Water is a hectic time for Appleton. Not only are the ospreys in residence until early September, but he is also preparing for the British Bird Fair which will attract around 17,000 visitors to the tranquil village of Egleton. They may wear saggy canvas jackets and floppy unflattering sun hats, but birders in this country alone now spend some \u00a330 million a year on their hobby. </p> <p>Three miles from Egleton, my wife and I found our own nesting spot, in the rather grown-up surroundings of Hambleton Hall in Oakham. There are no floppy hats here. Think panamas and blue blazers. Run by Tim Hart, the hotel is a member of the prestigious Relais et Chateaux group and attracts a high number of stressed city types wanting to escape from the pressures of the daily grind. Two hours drive from Heathrow and less than one from Leicester, it forms part of what the local tourist office likes to call \"Hidden England\". It is so well hidden that a lot of people have to be reminded that Rutland actually exists. </p> <p>Although Rutland is an ancient district, it lost its county status in 1974 and was subsumed under Leicestershire. Readers of a certain age may recall that Eric Idle, of Monty Python fame, made two series entitled Rutland Weekend Television, a comedy built around England's smallest TV station. RWTV was pure fiction, and the jokes sprang from the idea that because it was small everything had to be done very cheaply. In 1997, Rutland regained its \"independence\" and is proudly reinstated as England's smallest county - just 150 square miles. We could see a significant chunk of it from our room, especially the sweeping blue expanse of Rutland Water, Europe's largest manmade lake (all 3,000 acres of it). </p> <p>The great thing about Rutland Water is that it has a purpose-built rambling track around it. Enquiring about the track brought forth the offer of a pair of bicycles from Paul at the hotel's reception. \"Give me a moment,\" he said soothingly. \"And I will prepare them for you.\" It sounded as if they were living creatures. </p> <p>Once astride, we saw windsurfers and yachts streaking across the water as we sped along the gravel track skirting the lake. On the far shore, the imposing edifices of Burley-on-the-Hill and Normanton Church caught the afternoon sun. Local history relates that when Charles I visited here in 1628 he was presented with a pie, out of which popped England's smallest man, Jeffrey Hudson, who was only 18 inches tall. Confusingly, we were also not far from Burghley House, possibly the finest Elizabethan palace in England. Tim Hart told me that a lot of visitors to Rutland make a circuit of the local manors, which also includes the castles at Belvoir, Grimsthorpe and Rockingham. \"I always think of Rutland as a less crowded version of the Cotswolds,\" he explained. \"Because the history of this area was so connected to hunting in the 19th century there are vast tracts of great estates left, and the villages are pretty but not big enough to house large numbers of second-homers from London.\" </p> <p>At Grimsthorpe the next day, we saw what he meant. The soft yellowed stone of the neat country cottages was suitably picturesque, and the castle was set in a magnificent parkland of 3,000 acres, all of it accessible to the public. The estate also boasts several miles of dedicated, and family-friendly cycle track. Grimsthorpe castle itself (01778 591205, <a href=\"http://www.grimsthorpe.co.uk\">grimsthorpe.co.uk</a>) is only open for a couple of days each week, and consequently is rarely crowded, only attracting around 10,000 visitors a year. Small groups staying at Hambleton can arrange private tours if their stay doesn't coincide with official opening hours. </p> <p>That night at Clipsham, we ate well at the Michelin-starred Olive Branch, a radically renovated pub stuffed to the rafters with local families and couples munching chicken liver and foie gras parfait and tucking in to chargrilled rib-eye steaks. Our waitress claimed people occasionally drove up from London to eat there, and it seemed like an entirely reasonable idea, especially as our dinner for two including dessert came to less than \u00a340. </p> <p>Back at Hambleton Hall, we had the elegant main lounge all to ourselves for tea and petit fours. In the distance, Rutland Water was a steely blue smudge shimmering under the summer night-sky. </p> <p>Tim Ecott is the author of Vanilla: Travels In Search Of The Luscious Substance (Michael Joseph \u00a316.99).</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> What to watch: </strong> The Anglian Water Birdwatching Centre at Egleton Nature Reserve (01572 770651, <a href=\"http://www.rutlandwater.org.uk\">rutlandwater.org.uk</a>) open 9am-5pm daily all year, admission \u00a34.

  "<p>Rachael Padman says that changing sex did not make her a woman. The Cambridge University lecturer believes that the genital surgery she underwent in 1982 was just another step towards living as the woman she always felt she was, rather than the point at which she became female. </p> <p>By any measure Padman, the director of studies in physical sciences at the university's Newnham college, is a successful woman. Within the transsexual community her story is widely viewed as challenging negative stereotypes of transsexuals being unhappy and dysfunctional. </p> <p>Padman, 50, underwent gender reassignment after moving to England from her home country of Australia in 1977. She was assessed and treated with female hormones at the Charing Cross NHS gender identity clinic in north-west London while pursuing a PhD at the then all-male St John's college, Cambridge. </p> <p>But she encountered no hostility from her peers or tutors when in 1981 she started to live full-time as a woman in preparation for genital surgery. She gained her doctorate just after undergoing a sex change operation, paid for privately, in October 1982. </p> <p>Although she had an overwhelming desire to change gender from early childhood, Padman believes the main reason for her post-operative success is that her identity is not solely based on her being transsexual. </p> <p>Genital surgery was just a step towards leading the life she wanted, rather than her ultimate goal. She believes her work has always been just as, if not more important, to who she is - and influences how others treat her.</p> <p>\"I don't think that surgery is what created me,\" she says. \"I was already Rachael by that point. I realised afterwards that some people assumed I'd had the surgery two years earlier when I turned up at the lab and said 'I'm Rachael'. I suppose it did make me feel more female because I wasn't loaded up with two competing sets of hormones any more. But being an astronomer and physicist is my prime identity. I do get the impression that some people lose sight of the rest of their life.\"</p> <p>While some transsexual activists contend that no distinction should be made between those who are born and those who surgically become women, Padman believes it is important to be \"realistic\" and accept there are differences. </p> <p>She says: \"It doesn't matter how empathetic you are before or during transition or how well you are accepted, you have not been born or brought up as a woman and that inevitably makes a difference.</p> <p>\"I think that changing sex is easier for people who are sensitive about what they are doing. You need the sense to realise that certain people will have difficulties with what you're doing. Just putting on a dress and saying 'treat me as a woman' will not make others warm to you. You can't force anyone to accept you.\"</p> <p>The lecturer has difficulty understanding transsexuals who pretend they have always been the gender they identify as, but admits that disclosing her own background has required careful judgement. \"I'm amazed that people cut themselves off and try to invent a false history for themselves,\" says Padman. But she can understand why they would want to in the face of the prejudice of some people.</p> <p>\"I don't know how they cope. I can't say, 'when I was a little girl' - that's a lie. But I don't want to push my past in people's faces. I'm not sure it would be right to go round saying, 'when I was a little boy' - it's like trying to demand a reaction from people. I generally get around it by saying 'when I was little' or 'when I was a child'. </p> <p>\"My view now is that if something comes up and my change of gender is relevant, I'll comment. It's a matter of dealing with things honestly as they come along.\"</p> <p>She believes that this attitude helped her to overcome the only crisis she has faced since changing sex. In 1996, she was invited to take up a fellowship at Newnham, one of Cambridge's three all-women colleges. Germaine Greer, who was then a fellow of the college, subsequently argued that since Padman was legally a man, her appointment contravened college statutes. </p> <p>Although her appointment went ahead later, the very public airing of the debate led Padman to became preoccupied with whether she came across as female. For the next two years she felt she had lost control of her identity because her background was now common knowledge. \"I was trying to get to grips with the fact that the whole world knew,\" she says. \"It was like a second transition after 15 years of increasing confidence and being increasingly less worried about the way I presented myself.\"</p> <p>However, the support Padman received from friends, family and colleagues taught her to get on with being herself rather than worrying how she was perceived and judged by strangers. \"I believe that it has made me stronger,\" she says. \"The realisation that most people do take me at face value means that I no longer worry about whether I project 'femaleness'. Who gives a toss what someone thinks in the street - whom you've never met before - if your friends and family are supportive.\"</p> <p>The physicist admits still feeling hurt on the rare occasions that someone does mistakenly refer to her as 'sir'. But she feels that such reactions are not always necessarily rooted in transphobia. For example, some research suggests that people innately recognise differences in the facial traits of men and women. Other negative reactions she has encountered while working outside of Cambridge seemed rooted in sexism.</p> <p>On the whole, however, academia has proved an enormously positive environment for Padman. She realises she is lucky to work in such a liberal career. \"Academics are pretty open minded,\" she says. The students also strike her as unfazed by her past. \"Only one student out of 100 has ever commented about my background and they were very complimentary. I think the young are much more laid back.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Balletomania: The Love That Dared Not Speak Its Name</strong> <br>Edinburgh</p> <p>Audiences for these performances by Balletomania may be seated in Edinburgh but they will quickly be transported to Paris. Ballet Rimbaud (danced to the music of the Doors) is inspired by the absinthe-fuelled love affair between poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud in 19th-century Paris and the confrontation with Verlaine's wife Mathilde as she struggles to keep her man. Possession (to Shostakovich's Jazz Suite) is inspired by 1930s Paris and features Ernest Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas. The figures may be literary, but their interactions in these imaginative dance dramas (scenarios by Polly Fowler, choreography by Sheila Styles) are given acute and erotic bodily expression. <br> <strong>Bill Harpe</strong> <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> C, Chambers Sreet, Saturday 14 to Aug 30</p> <p><strong>Ballets C De La B: Tempus Fugit</strong> <br>Edinburgh</p> <p>The Festival's season of late-night, late-bookable events gives the UK its first showing of the latest production from Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. This hugely talented Flemish- Moroccan choreographer originally came to prominence as a dancer in the works of Alain Platel and, like his mentor, he uses a mixture of theatre, song and dance to extract a tapestry of stories from his hand-picked and vividly assorted performers. In his recent work Foi, Cherkaoui created one of the most compelling pieces of post 9/11 dance theatre to be seen on the British stage - examining the unifying and divisive roles that faith can play in our lives. Tempus Fugit addresses the even larger issue of Time - how we experience it, how we control it. Music and stories from West Africa, Europe and the Arab world are woven into this large-scale piece - creating a cross-cultural, cross-generational view of the past, present and future.

So Jean-Pierre Perreault's dance extravaganza, Joe - where Joe is the everyman of modern times - is both ancient and new. Twenty years after its premiere this is still a dazzling creation. Thirty-two performers in overcoats, fedoras and boots march, stomp, strut, run, roll, and leap on a steeply raked stage - and the only soundtrack is the thunder of pounding feet. It's an immensely powerful enactment of masculine group behaviour, of the domination of the group, of the desire to escape. This is certainly Joe.

  "<p>He may have been the coveted, if somewhat protracted, signing of previous manager Gerard Houllier, but Djibril Cisse's debut Premiership goal in the opening fixture of the season was only just enough to collect one precious point for Liverpool's current boss, Rafa Benitez.</p> <p>Liverpool and Tottenham fought out a 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane in a match that saw each side exercise control for large parts, with the predatory instincts of Cisse and his opposite number, Jermain Defoe, to the fore.</p> <p>Cisse turned sweetly to strike past Spurs goalkeeper Paul Robinson from close range in a first half that favoured the Merseysiders, while Spurs could lay claim to having the better of the second period, which culminated in a clinical poach from Defoe despite a suspicion of handball.</p> <p>Tottenham were certainly more adventurous after the restart, albeit still with no immediate end product to trouble Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. </p> <p>Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp powered a free-kick straight into the wall, while Johnnie Jackson blazed a shot well wide and Reds captain Steven Gerrard intervened just in time as Defoe tried to latch onto Ledley King's chipped through ball. </p> <p>The impudent young striker also nipped past two markers only to flick his shot over the top. </p> <p>In the early stages of the second hald, Liverpool still held sway where it really mattered, with midfield possession flowing towards the Tottenham goal. </p> <p>Indeed, Spurs were by now being restricted to hopeful long-range efforts, with Pedro Mendes striking a drive that flew high and wide into the further reaches of the stand behind Dudek's goal. </p> <p>Liverpool, meanwhile, threatened mainly on the break as Harry Kewell broke clear down the left flank and flashed a 25-yard shot just wide of the far post. </p> <p>Benitez was nevertheless looking to conserve his side's advantage, with Cisse being sacrificed as Florent Sinama-Pongolle was brought on with 26 minutes left to drop deeper in support of the midfield. </p> <p>Santini duly responded with a double substitution, as Gary Doherty and Timothee Atouba replaced Jackson and the impressive Nourredine Naybet. </p> <p>And, almost bizarrely, Spurs were level within just a few seconds of the restart, albeit amid some controversy. </p> <p>Liverpool were left appealing in vain for handball as Defoe challenged Jamie Carragher for a knock-down from Fredi Kanoute before swivelling to bury his shot past Dudek.</p>",
  "<p>If Kostas Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou find their careers ruined by accusations that they deliberately avoided a drugs test, then they would not be the first. </p> <p>Rio Ferdinand may be the best-known example of someone being punished for failing to make themselves available when the drug busters come knocking, but he was just the latest in a line of absentees who have paid a heavy price. </p> <p>The Manchester United and England defender was banned for eight months and missed Euro 2004 but others have paid an even harsher penalty. </p> <p>At Seoul in 1988 John Ngugi established himself as one of history's greatest distance runners when he raced to the Olympic 5,000 metres title. Now the Kenyan is almost a pauper, haunted by a doping ban imposed on him in 1993 and hunted by people he said were \"out to finish me\". </p> <p>He was gearing up to chase a record sixth world cross-country title when there was a knock on the door of his home in Nyahururu in the Rift Valley. </p> <p>It was John Whetton, a British tester from the international governing body, but Ngugi claimed because he was a stranger and did not know anything about the appointment he refused. He was banned for four years. </p> <p>Ngugi's British agent John Bicourt claimed Kenyan officials had not educated athletes that such tests would routinely be conducted. </p> <p>Neither had the officials give the tester introductory papers to show Ngugi, who eventually had his suspension lifted after 26 months. But he never recaptured his previous form and lost thousands of pounds in failed business deals. </p> <p>Sally Gunnell's greatest moment was in 1992 when she won the Olympic 400m hurdles title in Barcelona but earlier that year she had come close to being banned for four years because she was unavailable for an out-of-competition test. </p> <p>Gunnell had to face an inquiry in March 1992 to explain why she had missed a random drugs test while on a three-week training trip to Arizona. </p> <p>Representatives of the Sports Council (now UK Sport), who then undertook the testing on the federation's behalf, had turned up at her hotel to discover she had checked out eight days earlier because she had been unhappy with her accommodation. </p> <p>This was a clear breach of British Athletic Federation rules that at the time stated international athletes on a trip of more than five days must inform it of their whereabouts. </p> <p>It was only on Gunnell's return that she discovered the testing team had tried to contact her and two other athletes on the trip. She described the subsequent hearing as \"like a police interrogation\". </p> <p>She was cleared, but later claimed an official told her the federation had been \"thinking of using all three as an example\" to others, even though officials admitted she had not been trying to mislead anyone and there was no suggestion she was using banned performance-enhancing drugs. </p> <p>Gunnell was unlucky because in that period it was an open secret that some British athletes were tipped off by officials about when the testers were coming and managed to disappear until they could be sure they would test negative. </p> <p>No-notice out-of-competition testing is considered to be so important because it is seen as the main weapon in the drug fighters' armoury, as steroids are most beneficial to athletes while they are in training. </p> <p>That is why it is enshrined in the World Anti-Doping Agency code that any athlete who fails to take a test when asked should be treated as harshly as one who actually provides a positive sample. </p> <p>The most infamous example of athletes avoiding drug testing was in 1979 when scores of US athletes fled the Pan American Games when it was announced there would be testing for steroids. Those that left included Olympic champions and world record holders. </p> <p>It is not just in athletics that competitors have tried to evade being drug-tested. A recent example came in Wales last year when 19 players from the Welsh Division Three East side Penygraig were suspended for 18 months after refusing to submit to tests. </p> <p>There have been few more extreme examples of a competitor trying to avoid a test than in 2002 when Scott MacDougall, brother of Australia's rugby league international Adam, who fled sampling officers jumped over a fence. </p> <p>MacDougall was to be tested following the Canberra and North Sydney match at Canberra Stadium. But he ran from the Australian Sports Drug Agency officials, jumping a fence to escape before leaving in his car. He was suspended for two years. </p> <p><strong>Responsible drug bodies</strong> </p> <p><strong>World Anti-Doping Agency</strong> </p> <p>The Montreal-based body has overall responsibility for global drug testing. To compete here all 202 national committees and 28 sports must have signed Wada's anti-doping code, which details which substances are banned and stipulates a minimum two-year ban for all serious offences.</p> <p><strong>International Olympic Committee</strong> </p> <p>The biggest financial backer of Wada. Under its supervision the agency was established in 1999. It adheres to the Wada code but, during the Olympics, usually defined as a month - so for Athens it is July 30-August 30 - responsibility for all drug-testing comes under its control. That is why it was the IOC which tried to test Kederis and Thanou in Chicago this week and not Wada or the Greek authorities.</p> <p><strong>World governing bodies</strong> </p> <p>Big international federations, such as the International Association of Athletics Federations, conduct out-of-competition testing and are responsible for doping controls at their major events - but not the Olympics where their only function is to ensure the penalty determined by the IOC is enforced.</p> <p><strong>National bodies</strong> </p> <p>Every major country should test its own competitors. UK Sport carries out this function in Britain for nearly all of the country's sports. Every British competitor should have been drug-tested before leaving for Athens.</p>",
  "<p>Craig Fallon's hopes of an Olympic medal were dashed today when he was beaten in the second round and then denied the chance of reaching the repechage, and a possible bronze medal, but the judo star was mostly livid by what he saw as home-town officiating.</p> <p>Fallon, the world championship silver medallist in the 60 kilogram class, was stung with just four seconds remaining of his second round bout with Greece's Revazi Zintiridis, but he then required the home favourite to do him a favour. </p> <p>If Zintiridis had reached the semi-final, Fallon would have qualified for the repechage and the chance of an Olympic bronze medal. </p> <p>But the European silver medallist, after two draining rounds, ran out of steam and lost by Ippon to Iran's Masoud Haji Akhondzade - ending Fallon's Athens dream.</p> <p>He knelt on the mat and raised his arms in the air, crestfallen that he had been so close to a semi-final berth - and yet so far. </p> <p>\"I knew that it was going to be a bit biased, like it always is when you go somewhere and are fighting a home fighter,\" said Fallon. </p> <p>\"If it wasn't in Greece then maybe the fight would have gone the other way, I don't know. </p> <p>\"Knowing he is not Greek and a Georgian anyway, and knowing how tough Georgians are - I knew it was going to be a tough fight. </p> <p>\"I am bitterly, bitterly disappointed because everyone ahead of me in the draw was beatable.\"</p> <p>\"There were a few times I felt I had ippon. I felt like I had counted him a few times where I though ippon would have been called. It is up to the refs on the day,\" said Fallon. </p> <p>\"I'll look at the video later and decide whether I think the fight should have gone my way. In the end it is my fault. </p> <p>\"I shouldn't have lost concentration with four seconds to go. </p> <p>\"I was on top at the time and maybe if I'd had ippon earlier (it would have been over), but I was still winning and I threw the fight away.\"</p> <p>After a comfortable first-round victory over Australian Scott Fernandis, Fallon had been leading Zintiridis, who was blowing hard after his tough opening encounter. </p> <p>The 21-year-old was looking to set the pace and after slipping behind in a cagey opening, took control of the bout to such an extent that three times, Udo Quellmalz, Great Britain's performance director, jumped from his seat and screamed: \"Ippon, Ippon.\" </p> <p>Had any of the three been scored, Fallon would have won but the three referees concluded differently and awarded lower scores that still took the Brit into the lead. </p> <p>But with just four seconds remaining, Fallon appeared to invite Zintiridis onto him and could not escape the Ippon throw. </p> <p>Fallon walked dejectedly in front of the stomping, cheering bank of Greek supporters hoping against hope that Zintiridis would come through - only to watch from the bowels of the arena as the Iranian prevailed. </p> <p>\"I felt confident but the luck wasn't there and I'm bitterly, bitterly disappointed,\" said Fallon.</p> <p>\"The last four seconds I backed off and if I'd gone for it there was no way I'd have been thrown. </p> <p>\"I am not a good defender, I am much better when I am attacking.\" </p> <p>As he had proven in the first round with a quickfire demotion of Fernandis. </p> <p>He almost won after just 15 seconds but the referees' panel concluded the ippon he threw was outside the mat - although Fernandis was only granted 20 seconds grace. </p> <p>Fallon had emerged pumped up, jumping on the spot and anxious to get going, and he roared in with a left hip throw to complete victory in just 35 seconds.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Alchemy</strong><br>by Maureen Duffy<br>380pp, Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99</p> <p> Ever since Possession in 1990 there has been a growing sub-genre of novels that interweave a modern-day quest narrative with some kind of whiskery old historical text that may, or may not, be a fake. The text is usually a) discovered in a library - not a municipal one with screaming kids, but the sort that has leather chairs and hushed whispers; b) delivered by a mysterious stranger who turns out to be a dodgy professor; or c) bequeathed to the protagonist by an enticingly remote godparent who once worked in code-breaking. </p> <p>The idea is, of course, that as she starts to delve into the historical text (and \"delve\" is a word that these novels virtually spin on) the protagonist discovers to her amazement that the story she is reading throws up startling insights, clues and resonances into the puzzle that she is currently committed to solving in her own life (could be fraud, more likely to be murder, always a broken heart in there somewhere). </p> <p>In Alchemy Maureen Duffy goes for b), the dodgy professor option. Dr Alastair Galton arrives at the office of Jade Green, a self-employed solicitor who has agreed to take on his case for unfair dismissal, with a copy of \"The Memorial of Amyntas Boston\". It is thanks to distributing this text - a memoir of a 17th-century girl written while awaiting trial for witchcraft - to his history students that Galton has been dismissed from the University of Wessex, a uni that was never even a poly but simply a clot of old teacher-training colleges. Green's task, naturally, is to read Boston's memoir while infiltrating the University of Wessex as an MA student to see if she can get more background to Galton's case (it's evidence of just how fishy Wessex is that Green manages to get taken on halfway through the year with little more than a fake birth certificate). </p> <p>The connections between these stories immediately become apparent (and, just in case they don't, Duffy is on hand to jog and point). Boston, a teenage physician, is a girl who dresses as a boy and has an affair with her mistress, the Countess of Pembroke. Green is a lesbian who likes to play at being a private dick and has recently had an affair with her boss's wife, who is called Helen Chalmers (a charmer, as Duffy anxiously points out). Just to add to this cats' cradle of referencing, Green is writing her MA dissertation on cross-dressing in Shakespeare's plays and Dr Galton first introduced himself to her as Dr Adrian Gilbert, the chief baddy in Boston's narrative. </p> <p>As a context for all this \"shape-shifting\" - a word that feels as though it should be underlined in this narrative - Duffy has Green spend an awful lot of time pondering the morphing tendencies of the modern electronic age. Indeed Green can barely turn on her computer or send an email without telling us all about the ironies of the virtual world. How, for instance, our hard disks leave us vulnerable to spying, just as in Boston's time Walsingham's police network cut seals and used invisible ink in order to peer into men's souls. Or how cyberporn offers only look-but-don't-touch pleasure in contrast to \"the stickers of the prossies in the old phone boxes\". All perfectly true, but not particularly convincing in the mouth of a woman who is supposed to be 36-ish and will have been familiar with joined-up computers for most of her working life. </p> <p>It is this sense of overworking themes that have already been pretty much exhausted that does for Alchemy in the end. The mystery itself turns out to be a rather disappointing one about the University of Wessex doubling as the front for a nasty profit-grabbing cult. Galton goes on being dodgy - getting arrested for hopping around naked at a witchcraft convention. Green, meanwhile, is left speculating endlessly on things, such as the solidity of her Acton childhood (as opposed, naturally, to the wispiness of her present-day home just next to Waterloo station, a place of constant comings and goings), to the extent that you wish someone would give the girl a proper crime to solve. A really solid one set, say, in a Cambridge college library with a body and a sneery male detective to contend with.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kathryn Hughes is writing a biography of Mrs Beeton.</p>",
  "<p> Matthew Pinsent launched his pursuit of a fourth successive Olympic gold medal when he guided Britain's Men's coxless fours through to the semi-final on a sweltering morning at the idyllic rowing centre at Schinias. </p> <p>But Pinsent warned that the team, which has suffered so much disruption and injury over the past four years, would have to improve hugely if they were to beat the fancied Canadians in next Saturday's final. </p> <p>The British four of Pinsent, James Cracknell, Ed Coode and Steve Williams surged into an early lead and by the 500m mark had opened up more than a two second lead over Slovenia and Italy. </p> <p>But just when it looked as if all they had to do was cruise home with comfort they allowed the Italians to come back at them and were forced to hang on for the final quarter of the race. </p> <p>There were shades of Sydney in 2000 with the Italians pressing in their slipstream and Pinsent said: \"There were some really nice things and we got control of the race early on but in the second-half it looked as if we were settling for the win. </p> <p>\"We'll not get away with that in the semi-final and definitely not in the final. But with the time we've had and the changes over 2000m we are bound to make mistakes. We've just got to make them as small as possible.\" </p> <p>Amazingly, it was only the second competitive contest the crew had raced together, the first being at Henley last month, after Coode took over when Alex Partridge suffered a collapsed lung. </p> <p>Add to that the chopping and changing, with Pinsent and Cracknell switching from the pairs, and Williams is the only surviving member of the original squad. </p> <p>\"After the summer we've been through we'd settle for winning one-on-one against anybody,\" said Pinsent. </p> <p>\"That wasn't up to our standard but there is a lot more to come. With the problems we've had, we'd be lucky if it was perfect and I'd give us a solid six or seven.\" </p> <p>Cracknell, who won gold along with Pinsent in Sydney four years ago, admitted they had been surprised at the power of the Italian four, believing the USA might have posed the bigger danger. </p> <p>As it was America trailed in last, Italy and Slovenia securing the other semi-final berths. </p> <p>It was the closeness of the victory, a shade more than two seconds, which perturbed Cracknell. </p> <p>\"To be honest we didn't expect to be challenged,\" said Cracknell. \"We expected America and Slovenia to be there and we'd hoped to see them all off by 1500m. We didn't manage to do that. It was a good first quarter, though just now my legs and throat don't think it was.\" </p> <p>It rounded off a mixed session for the British team on a morning when Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie turned up at the rowing venue and caused quite a stir among the spectators and photographers. </p> <p>They arrived just in time to see medal hopes Cath Bishop and Katherine Grainger get their Women's pair hopes under way. </p> <p>Aberdeen's Grainger was a silver medallist in the quadruple sculls four years ago in Sydney and supplies the tactical brains for the partnership while Bishop is more the brawn of the operation. </p> <p>At the 1000m halfway mark, however, the Britons were five seconds down on leaders Belarus though their stroke was smooth and steady. </p> <p>At the finish the Belarus pair had extended that lead to 6.93 seconds but Bishop and Grainger, who both retire from international rowing at the end of the Olympics, will not be too disappointed with their second place position which sees them safely into Monday's repechage. </p> <p>They were certainly in better shape than the New Zealand pair of Juliette Haigh and Nicky Coles who made a false stroke in the next heat and fell out of their boat, eventually coming last by a considerable distance. </p> <p>Matthew Wells and Matthew Langridge, who took bronze at the season's opening World Cup in Poznan, made a superb second-half dash to take their place in the semi-finals of the Men's double sculls. </p> <p>Wells, who twice won the Boat Race, and Langridge were lying fourth in Heat Two and out of a qualifying spot for the final at the half-way mark but an impressive surge of power saw them sweep past the United States as they tried to haul in Italians Rossano Galtarossa and Alessio Sartori. </p> <p>With three qualifying for the semi-finals Langridge, from Northwich, and Wells, who lives in Surrey but whose home town is Hexham, left the Americans in their wake to take second place, more than seven seconds behind the Italian boat. </p> <p>Sarah Winckless and Elise Laverick continued the stream of Brits into the repechage in the Women's double sculls. </p> <p>They were up against a formidable pair in New Zealand sisters Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell and at half-way the Brits were more than five seconds down but it was a measure of their tenacity that they managed to reduce the arrears by a shade to finish second, 4.16 seconds behind the New Zealand girls and a distance ahead of third-placed Ukraine. </p> <p>Earlier, Ian Lawson had got Britain's rowing challenge under way with a battling second place in the Men's single sculls. </p> <p>The 27-year-old from Otley in Yorkshire dug deep to stay in contact with Norway's Olaf Tufte who cruised to an easy victory with Lawson second 11.47 seconds back qualifying for the repechage.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Garrincha: The Triumph and Tragedy of Brazil's Forgotten Footballing Hero</strong> <br>by Ruy Castro, translated by Andrew Downie<br>416pp, Yellow Jersey, \u00a317</p> <p><strong> Gazza: My Story</strong><br> by Paul Gascoigne, with Hunter Davies<br> 390pp, Headline, \u00a318.99</p> <p> One of his legs was two inches shorter than the other. He lost his virginity to a goat, slept with hundreds of women and sired at least 14 children. When he played for the Brazilian national team in the 1950s and early 60s, he scored 34 goals and won the World Cup twice. He killed his mother-in-law in a car crash, then died of drink. His name was Garrincha, and his exploits make Paul Gascoigne look like an amateur. </p> <p>\"When Manuel was born, the midwife was the first person to notice that his legs were crooked. The left leg bent out and the right leg bent in, as if a gust of wind had blown them out of position.\" Ruy Castro begins his biography of Garrincha with the most unlikely fact about this extraordinary footballer: his wonky legs. With his swaying walk and slim frame, he looked like a little bird, which was how the young Manuel dos Santos gained his nickname: Garrincha, the wren. </p> <p>Garrincha was born in a British town. At the end of the 19th century, a British company had arrived in Pau Grande, about 45 miles from Rio de Janeiro, cut down the trees, laid roads, built a factory and created a new town for its workers. British bosses clothed and housed the Brazilians, ruling every aspect of their lives. Along with the virtues of hygiene and hard work, the British taught their employees one more vital lesson: how to play football. </p> <p>Like every other resident of Pau Grande, Garrincha started working in the factory a month and a day after his 14th birthday. Although he played for the factory's football team on Sundays, he showed little interest in the wider game. When Brazil hosted the World Cup in 1950, loudspeakers broadcast the matches in the town's main square. During the final, Garrincha went fishing. Returning home, he found everyone in tears - Brazil had lost to Uruguay - and couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. </p> <p>Castro describes Garrincha as \"the most amateur footballer professional football ever produced\". He never trained. He had no agent, didn't bother reading his contracts, and usually signed them before the figures had been filled in. When he was given a bonus after the World Cup, he handed the cash to his wife, who hid it under the children's mattress. Years later, they remembered the money, and discovered a rotting mass of sodden paper. The bonus had been destroyed by bedwetting. </p> <p>On the field, Garrincha was selfish, undisciplined, unpredictable and indisputably brilliant. Among Castro's many neat anecdotes, he describes Garrincha's behaviour during the 1958 World Cup game against the USSR: \"After leaving a defender on the ground Garrincha put his foot on the ball and with his back to the player offered his hand to help him up.\" Having hauled his opponent to his feet, he dribbled past him and ran on. Even in the biggest games of his career, he would nutmeg a player, run past, wait for him to catch up, then nutmeg him again. Just for fun. </p> <p>His career had a depressingly familiar structure: dazzling success, bacchic excess, swift decline. He went to three World Cups, and won two. His performances in 1958 and 1962 turned him into an international star and a revered symbol throughout Brazil. By 1966, drink and injuries had ruined him. He played his last game for Brazil in Liverpool; they collapsed 3-1 to Hungary. It was his 60th game for Brazil, and the first defeat with him in the team. </p> <p>While more self-disciplined players had been training their bodies and expanding their bank balances, Garrincha just played, drank and screwed until he collapsed. Turned away by the big Brazilian clubs, he searched for a job abroad, touting himself around Portugal and Italy, but no one wanted to hire the swaying, stuttering drunk. A Saudi Arabian team showed some interest, but Garrincha refused to play for teetotallers. His relationship with Elza Soares, the love of his life, disintegrated when he punched her in a drunken rage. Incontinent, impotent and penniless, Garrincha vainly tried to find work as a player or a coach, and played his last game only three weeks before his death. He died attached to a drip in the alcoholics ward of a Rio hospital. </p> <p>Castro's biography is passionate, fascinating and surprisingly moving. Although marred by occasional lapses into awkward prose, and lacking any discussion of social or political contexts, the book is a worthy tribute to a footballer who has been neglected merely because - as the translator points out his introduction -\"He played at a time before the marriage of football and television.\" </p> <p>If Rupert Murdoch was the best man at that marriage, Paul Gascoigne was one of the lads who got so drunk at the stag night that he missed the ceremony. Many of the motifs of his life are shared with Garrincha: injuries, alcoholism, wife-beating, clinics, scandals, a sudden elevation to the status of national icon at a World Cup, followed by a giddy plunge from hero to outcast. One thing separates them: Garrincha avoided any contact with the media, refusing to give interviews, spurning journalists, keeping his own counsel. Over the years, Gascoigne has sold his story to innumerable tabloids, living his personal life in public. His autobiography, ghostwritten by Hunter Davis, is a depressing stream of self-delusion and self-pity. It starts with an innocent little boy who loves to play football, and ends with a confused, lonely man counting the injuries and operations that have been inflicted on his shattered body. He has lost his talent, his wife and more than \u00a38m in fees and salaries, but can't understand how or why. In the final chapter, he even makes a tragic pitch for work: \"I've now just turned 37, but I'm fit and slim and still able to play, if anyone wants me.\"</p> <p>According to Gazza, Gascoigne has limited interest in books, choosing to load his bedside table with American self-help manuals such as How to Stop Worrying and Anxiety and Panic Attacks - their Cause and Cure. He should be persuaded to make an exception for Garrincha. He would learn more about himself than by reading his own autobiography.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Ancient Greek Athletics </strong><br> by Stephen G Miller<br> 288pp, Yale, \u00a325</p> <p> Ancient Olympia was primarily a place of pagan worship. That is why, after more than 1,000 years of activity, it was eventually closed down by Christian decree, circa AD393. We cannot blame Emperor Theodosius for this. Olympia was a site where many strange deities were worshipped in ways that would also disgust modern sensibilities. Supreme among them was Zeus, in whose honour oxen were sacrificed by the hundred. The focal point of the sanctuary was a huge, stinking pile of ash, bones and bovine offal. </p> <p>Could we have endured the stench, for the sake of Olympia's pride: the great, original \"Olympic Games\"? I doubt it. Much human blood was spilled here, too. The most esteemed contestants were all-in fighters to whom bruises meant little - athletes whose victories came at the cost of their blood, teeth, looks and consciousness. Levels of violence were nauseating. One wrestler specialised in breaking the fingers of anyone who challenged him; another boxer successfully rummaged for the entrails of his opponent. And the prime attraction for spectators was a challenge far too hazardous ever to figure in the modern Olympic programme. A driver in the chariot-racing could feel grateful just to reach the finishing post with self and vehicle intact. </p> <p>The festival was noisy - especially after 396BC, when contests for heralds and trumpet-blowers were introduced. Anyone with something to sell or publicise was liable to turn up at Olympia: flagrant exhibitionism was not confined to the (stark naked) male athletes. Poets and painters would strut about in gaudy robes, astronomers displayed their latest calculations about the cosmos. Philosophers made extraordinary appearances. Pythagoras added to his own enigmatic cult status by revealing to spectators in the stadium at Olympia that one of his thighs was made of gold. </p> <p>One could go on. The point is that the ruins of Olympia, set on the margins of Arcadia, are deceptively pleasant, and should not be idealised with too much faded grandeur. The return of the modern Olympics to Greece in 2004 may be glossed with some sentiment of spiritual \"homecoming\", but it is hardly an accurate simulation of antiquity - a mercy for which we may be truly thankful. Our own Olympic tradition began in 1896. While some aspects of the modern jamboree may now curiously reflect ancient conditions - the hucksters, certainly, and the intensely specialised preparation of the athletes - it is safe to say that Olympia past is another country; \"sport\" was done differently there. </p> <p>So we need scholarly books to tell us what it was like, and few scholars are better qualified to do so than Stephen Miller of UCLA Berkeley, who for several decades has been excavating in Nemea, another major athletic centre of the ancient Peloponnese. Miller's enthusiasm for delivering the kind of practical detail that sports buffs require is evident on every page. How runners lined up for the start. Why competitors tied their foreskins into knots. How the javelin was thrown. What sort of oil was used for rubbing down. And even what sort of willow-bush provided the whips used by referees to enforce rules among the athletes and order in the crowd. </p> <p>The rules are important to Miller, because one of his central contentions is that the gymnastic disciplines - that is, all the non-equestrian events: running, wrestling, pentathlon and so on - flourished in Greece precisely because all participants were equal before the law. No one got a head-start in the stadium. A ploughboy could box against a prince. It was a fastidiously level playing-field; too level, it seems, for the likes of Alexander the Great, who notoriously refused to enter the lists unless he could be sure of running against fellow royalty. At the same time, there was absolutely no indulgence of the ideal that everyone must win - or indeed that it was worth simply taking part. Winning alone was what mattered. Losers got nothing but shame and abuse; at some venues, onlookers were even licensed to assault those trailing in a race. </p> <p>Two aspects of Miller's analysis might be queried. He denies any link between the daily routines of athletic training and a widespread expectation that members of a Greek city-state should keep themselves ready for military service. Yet when it comes to explaining why ball games were never institutionalised in Greece, he declares that \"ball-playing did not prepare the future citizen in any meaningful way for his responsibilities\". Admittedly, even in antiquity there were critics who derided the notion that a champion discus-thrower was any use in the front line of fighting. Yet classical democracy was founded on the principle of voters assuring civic defence; and whatever else Plato might have excluded from his perfect Republic, the practice of pseudo-military athletics was firmly established there. </p> <p>Miller is perhaps also too tolerant of the old-fashioned view that after Alexander (who died in 323BC), athletics degenerated into \"an entertainment business\". Career athletes, pumped with celebrity status, were already strutting their stuff. And increasing evidence from around the Roman empire points to a popular resurgence of athletics around the time of Emperor Hadrian, in the second century AD. Earlier, St Paul could count on his readers generally understanding athletic metaphors for the apostolic life. We ought also to recognise that two of history's traditional villains, Nero and Herod the Great, were generous benefactors of sport for the public good. </p> <p>But these are matters of debate, and do not detract from a book whose achievement is to have gathered a mass of historical and archeological evidence into a primer of Greek athletic practice. As with politics, literature, medicine, philosophy and much else, the Greeks may not have been the original exponents of regulated sport. But they were the proto-organisers: the first to talk it through and set it up. Miller's handbook redeems the sheer scale of that enterprise. In doing so, he provides us with a reliable measure by which to assess the well-meaning distortion of antiquity that propelled Baron Pierre de Coubertin to reinvent the Olympic Games as an international celebration of peace, goodwill and athletic amateurism.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Ancient Olympics: War Minus the Shooting</strong> <br>by Nigel Spivey <br>296pp, Oxford, \u00a312.99 </p> <p>It is ironically appropriate that the mythical stables (or rather farmyards) of Augeas were situated on the future site of the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. The story was that Augeas never used to clean out the stinking, insalubrious dungyards of his huge cattle herds; eventually Hercules turned up and diverted the local river to wash out the accumula tions of slurry. While he was at it, he inaugurated the Olympic Festival, at least according to one of several founding myths. Ironically appropriate because there is probably no tradition derived from ancient Greece that has become so clogged and contaminated by ideological dung, self-interested nationalist ordure, and bogus sanitising as the modern Olympics. </p> <p>The process was begun in a big way by the founder, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, bullshitter extraordinaire. Both his and more recent deposits have relied on disingenuous or downright false appeals to the ancient Olympics. Not least is the use of the term \"games\" - as in \"playing the game\", \"it's only a game\", \"a game for gentlemen\": the originals were serious competitions in a sacred space between men who were seldom if ever \"non-professionals\" in any modern sense. </p> <p>Hercules-like, Nigel Spivey sets about clearing all the mountainous cowpats from the ancient Olympics, and sets out to tell it straight, like it was, in all its strangeness. His compact book is well informed, well written, and well organised (though poorly illustrated). Spivey writes as a factual recorder, a cultural historian, an archaeologist and (his speciality) an expert on sculpture. He brings the (relatively few) events alive; he explains their organisation and technicalities; he unravels the various interests invested in them; and he fills in the larger cultural scene, which included music, speech-making, diplomacy, commissioning poetry, innumerable dedications and public buildings - and, not least, the slaughter, cooking and consumption of vast numbers of cattle. All this information is conveyed with an admirable calmness, clarity and vigour - a feat of scholarly athleticism. </p> <p>Sometimes, perhaps, his lip tends to curl into \"the sneer of cold command\" (command of the subject, that is). Sometimes a pedigree calf is thrown out with the slurry. For instance, Spivey emphasises the discomforts of the high-summer festival, with its vast camping grounds and poor sanitation - \"this great sporting occasion - an over-heated, land- locked valley, blighted by flies and dust\". Yet ancient sources go on about the plentiful shady trees, first planted by Hercules, it was said, and the unfailing waters of the river Alpheios (is its broad valley \"land-locked\"?). And huge numbers of tents and rugs under the stars still provide the standard accommodation at many sites of pilgrimage and shared festivity throughout the world. It is clear that tens of thousands were only too eager to make the long journey and to converge on Olympia for the biggest and brightest gathering of the ancient Greek world. It was, along with Delphi, the prime destination of Greek theoria , usually translated as \"pilgrimage\", but meaning something more like a journey of festival experience (and ancestor of \"theory\"). </p> <p>Spivey is also pretty scathing about the \"Olympic truce\". This was declared by travelling heralds throughout the Greek world -which spread, of course, around the shores of much of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea - and the ceasefire held good for 16 days before the quadrennial festival. Spivey makes much of one year (364BC) when it broke down in disastrous military violence, which spread to the sanc tuary itself; but the fact remains that there was a period of universal peace, however brief, throughout the much-conflicted Greek world for nearly every one of the more than 100 Olympic festivals that were held before the Romans came (and for even more under the Roman empire). </p> <p>The power of the truce is clearly shown by the dispassionate account of Thucydides of what happened in 420BC. The Spartans had slipped in an act of military aggression under cover of the truce, with a specious claim that it had not yet been officially announced in Sparta. The organisers banned them from the events unless they paid a large fine, even though they were by far the most powerful and aggressive state in the whole of the Peloponnese. The furious Spartans refused to pay, but they did accede to the ban. It was not for nothing that the leading intellectuals of the Greek world used to make speeches at Olympia about the possibilities of \"united thinking\", or homonoia ). To dismiss all this as a rhetorical \"trope\" is itself merely a trope in the rhetoric of deflation. </p> <p>By and large, however, this book does a great job of clearing the Olympic stables of their accumulated muck, above all by setting the ancient Olympics in their social contexts in a complicated world of economics, status-seeking and politics. Spivey sluices away the empty pieties about the Olympics as free from vested interests or politics. The idea that sport should be - or indeed could be - separated from politics is almost as vacuous as the analogous claim for religion (though less dangerous). The more bitter truth is memorably and movingly captured in Seamus Heaney's sonnet \"The Augean Stables\". It starts from admiring the marble relief from the temple of Zeus, now in the museum at Olympia, which shows Hercules, guided by Athena, breaching the banks of the river Alpheios. The last six lines need to be quoted in full: \"And it was there at Olympia, down among the green willows, / The lustral wash and run of river shallows, / That we heard of Sean Brown's murder in the grounds / Of Bellaghy GAA Club. And imagined / Hose-water smashing hard back off the asphalt / In the car park where his athlete's blood ran cold.\" </p> <p>Sports, athletics, even festivals are irremediably political. And it will take international human endeavour and cultural imagination - homonoia - to do anything towards clearing out the festering piles of hatred, aggression and vengefulness from the world that is celebrating the Athens 2004 Olympics. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Oliver Taplin is a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and author of Homeric Soundings: The Shaping of the Iliad (Clarendon Press).</p>",
  "<p>In some ways, Hollywood is the anti-glamour. Like the Emerald City, it shimmers tantalisingly on the horizon. But unless you put on your green-glazed goggles, it's impossible not to notice that, inside, everyone is on a weird starvation diet, in bed at 10pm in case a late night inspires a spot, and burning through hours with extensive depilatory treatments and plastic surgery. Still, if a trend takes root there, we all become slavish followers sooner or later. And the good news is that not only is the latest fad good for your health, but it makes delicious cocktails. </p> <p>It is pomegranate juice - a seductively coloured, rich-red drink with a suitably tortured background (in Greek mythology, Persephone was bound to the underworld for ever after eating pomegranate). </p> <p>Fresh pomegranate juice contains more antioxidants than green tea. It is packed with potassium and vitamins. It is so darned good for you that one scientist even believes it has the potential to spare certain patients heart-bypass surgery. </p> <p>It tastes rich and astringent and makes wonderful bellinis when added to prosecco. Its cocktail possibilities are similar to cranberry juice - it's great with vodka (cue pomegranate martinis) and makes yummy pomegranate cosmopolitans. </p> <p>Naturally, there is a catch: you can't buy it over here. What you can get is a drink called Pomegreat (Sainsbury's and Waitrose, \u00a31.39/litre carton). </p> <p>This bears roughly the same relationship to fresh pomegranate juice that Ocean Spray does to fresh cranberry juice and is enriched with vitamins and folic acid. Like the fresh version, it is good for the heart and it mixes successfully with vodka to make Sea Breeze-style cocktails. </p> <p>According to Adam Pritchard, whose company makes it, this is as close as we're likely to get to the real thing. 'Fresh pomegranate juice is very expensive. It would be impossible to sell here.' </p> <p>Pritchard first drank pomegranate juice in Peshawar, Pakistan, where market traders use pedal-powered machines to extract the juice from the fruit. He warns against trying to squeeze your own: it is a messy, pith-ridden business that no ordinary juicer is equipped to cope with. 'I've tried with a lemon squeezer and a juicing machine, and both times it was a disaster.' </p> <p>To make Pomegreat, a centrifugal spinner is used to separate first the juice sacks, then the seeds, from the skin. </p> <p>Also, in this country, apparently we just don't have the right sort of pomegranates. </p> <p>'Most of those on sale here are from Spain.

  "I had arranged to interview a woman, a refugee being held in a detention centre, earlier this month. But on the day that we were to speak, she was deported. This seemed unjust purely on legal grounds, since her solicitor was still attempting to continue through judicial review her claim for asylum. And it was particularly unjust since this woman - let's call her Jeanne - said that on a previous attempt at deportation on July 10, nine officials had restrained her physically by pinning her by her arms, twisting her neck and sitting on her back. Her 15-month-old child had seen the attack, and when he became distressed, she asked officials to take him to his father - the child is a British citizen because he has a British father. But the child was put into foster care, and the woman said it was some time before her partner was able to take him home. <p>I don't know how Jeanne felt when she was sitting in Yarl's Wood detention centre for three weeks without her son, or when she was deported to Ivory Coast without him 10 days ago. How would you feel? It seems almost cheap to try to give words to experiences like this. Pain, sorrow, anger, fear; nothing seems quite big enough. </p> <p>The experiences of refugees in detention centres flared briefly into the public consciousness a couple of weeks ago in the aftermath of a riot at Harmondsworth. Interest seems to have faded already, but it is necessary to try to keep a light shining on these experiences - because individuals working in this field say there is an increase in allegations of serious ill-treatment of refugees in detention centres or during deportation attempts. </p> <p>\"In this office we have only recently received allegations that people are being physically abused by officials in Britain,\" said Liz Norman, a caseworker at the solicitors Punatar and Co, in north London. \"I am certainly hearing more stories of abuse than in the past,\" said Nicola Rogers, a barrister who specialises in immigration law. \"I am seeing increasing numbers of cases of ill-treatment,\" Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor with Birnberg Peirce, told me. </p> <p>The government and its agencies are acting on a continuum with a hostile public attitude that has been developed by the rightwing press. But however inured you are to the nasty rhetoric, what is shocking is that harsh treatment seems to be increasingly targeted at women and children. Nicola Rogers says that she believes the children are no longer seen as children, but simply as an extension of the adult, the scum, the leech. And some people working in the field also say they believe that, given the pressure on immigration officers to meet quotas for removals, women with young children are being increasingly targeted for detention and deportation because it is assumed that they will go quietly. So although women make up only a small minority of those in detention, stories of ill-treatment and injustice involving women and children are becoming more frequent. </p> <p>I spoke to one woman, Sumaiya Kizza, who was visiting a friend on Sunday July 18 when she heard a banging on the door at 7.30am. She opened it to find several police and immigration officers. Even though they had actually come for her friend, Sumaiya and her 10-month-old baby were also forced into the van, without a chance to pack or even to dress properly. Sumaiya's papers were, in fact, in order, her asylum claim was still pending, and she had never failed to turn up to an appointment. But she and her baby were taken to the immigration centre at Croydon and then, in a boiling hot van, to Oakington detention centre, her baby sobbing itself hoarse; even when they got there, she was given no suitable food for the baby. </p> <p>Sumaiya was released the following Thursday, but only after pressure from Women Against Rape, a campaigning organisation that supports many women in detention and at risk of deportation. The friend detained with her (who is too nervous to give her real name - we'll call her Hannah) was taken twice to Heathrow for deportation with her two-year-old daughter, who is a British citizen and cannot therefore legally be forced into deportation. As with Jeanne, Hannah found herself facing the impossible choice of leaving her child or taking the child with her into a country where she believed their lives would be in danger. </p> <p>\"This officer shouted and grabbed me and pulled me up and down. Then they pointed to this group of men in suits and said, if you're not going they will handle you physically and you will see who is the winner. Then they grabbed my daughter off me and held her. I said, let me hold her. She started crying. He was holding her so I had to follow them to the aeroplane.\" This attempted deportation on July 19 and another on July 22 were halted at the last moment; legal proceedings concerning Hannah and her daughter are continuing. </p> <p>Although decent campaigning organisations and lawyers carry on, stopping an unfair deportation here or springing a distressed detainee there, most people in detention are incredibly isolated, unable to access any support, and their stories are not heard. It is quite glamorous for journalists to find tales of rape and torture in darkest Africa, but much less intriguing to hear how some of the survivors may end up crying in the back of a van on the way to Heathrow. </p> <p>One woman who is currently pursuing a claim for compensation against the Home Office had sought asylum on the basis that she had been tortured, raped and beaten in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but was held for five months in various detention centres in the UK. Her solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, told me that one night - without a removal notice being served on her, which is legally required before any attempt at deportation is made - officials burst into her room at 3am. According to the woman, they pushed her to her knees while she was naked, twisted her arm behind her back and struck her back. A witness to her ordeal said that she saw and heard the woman shouting: \"They're killing me, they're beating me!\" She was left in another room and attempted suicide by tying a torn sheet around her neck, but she was then handcuffed, given a dress and nothing else, and taken to Heathrow. The pilot refused to allow her on board because of her excessive distress and lack of proper clothing. </p> <p>Although liberals tend to say that they are on the side of genuine refugees, a terrible fatalism infects this debate. Perhaps we have begun to believe that widespread use of detention and forced deportation is essential for a workable immigration system; but too many stories that you hear are at variance with even government guidelines - like the detention of refugees who are at no risk of absconding, or the forced deportation of refugees who have not exhausted their legal options - and characterise a piecemeal, callous system in which the right hand deliberately fails to know what the left hand is doing. </p> <p>Many people working in the field told me that they believed the public would not accept these abuses if they knew more about what was happening. Certainly, if you have once heard one of these stories first hand it sticks like a burr in your mind. I wish I could play to you the painful sobs of Sumaiya and Hannah, as they told me about their children's distress and their own fear that it might all happen again tomorrow. And all this is being done in the pretence that our society needs protecting from these women. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:n.walter@btinternet.com\">n.walter@btinternet.com</a></p>",

  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday August 17</b> <br>  In the article below, we said in error that the Serious Fraud Office is one of the organisations involved in the merger to form the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. The SFO will continue to operate as an independent government department but will work closely with Soca.      The first head of Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, which is to have 5,000 agents, was named yesterday as Bill Hughes, the director of the National Crime Squad. <p>The former head of MI5, Sir Stephen Lander, was appointed chairman of the FBI-style agency, Soca, which is due to be set up in 2006 as part of a renewed drive against the multibillion-pound drug and people trafficking trade in Britain. </p> <p>Announcing the appointments yesterday, the home secretary, David Blunkett, said that Mr Hughes, who will be paid up to \u00a3150,000 a year as director general of Soca, had a proven track record in the police service and in managing the police response to serious and organised crime. </p> <p>\"As criminals become more sophisticated, so we must raise our game to fight it. The creation of a single agency to tackle organised crime marks a step change in our efforts to reduce the harm it does to the UK and its citizens,\" said Mr Blunkett. </p> <p>The new agency is to be created from an amalgamation of the National Crime Squad, which Mr Hughes currently heads, with the National Criminal Intelligence Service, Special Branch, the Serious Fraud Office, and the investigative arms of customs and the immigration service. There will also be input from the security services. One of its aims will be to end the occasional turf wars that ignite between the different law enforcement agencies. </p> <p>Soca will be able to call on the resources of about 5,000 investigators when it starts work in two years' time. Legislation to be discussed this autumn will give the agency powers to set up a new \"supergrass\" system, with US-style plea bargaining used on a much wider scale in the hope that those who turn \"Queen's evidence\" will help break some of the organised crime gangs operating in Britain. </p> <p>Mr Hughes, 53, was a crash safety engineer for British Leyland before he joined Thames Valley police in 1975. He worked his way up through the ranks to become deputy chief constable of Hertford shire before joining the National Crime Squad in 2001. </p> <p>He has said that he has always been obsessed by organised crime, which he describes as \"people who divorce themselves from the dirty end of the business but are fuelling illegal trade\". In recent years he has also taken a leading role in Operation Reflex, which combats illegal migration routes across Europe. </p> <p>Mr Hughes said yesterday that he hoped the new organisation would be flexible, innovative and, above all, one step ahead of the criminals. </p> <p>\"That means building an organisation that will attack the often very complex and multi-faceted world of serious and organised crime. It means working with our international partners to tackle the criminal across borders as well as national organised gangs.\" </p> <p>The appointment of Sir Stephen, who was head of MI5 in the 1990s, underlines the importance that ministers place on the degree of cooperation that Soca will need to develop with the security services in order to make any headway.</p>",
  "Lawyers and campaigners for refugees say that they are seeing increasing numbers of cases where women and children asylum seekers are being picked up for deportation before their legal options have been exhausted. <p>Home Office guidelines state that asylum seekers should \"not be removed from the UK while there is outstanding legal action\". </p> <p>But solicitors involved in deportation cases accuse the immigration authorities of targeting women with young children, even when they have grounds for further legal proceedings, in the hope that they will come quietly. The government, they claim, always has difficulty meeting its targets on removals. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned of several cases in which lawyers allege that mothers and children were picked up for deportation while the legal process was still continuing. </p> <p>Campaigners also claim that they are receiving more complaints about ill-treatment by immigration officers before deportation attempts. </p> <p>A spokeswoman at Women Against Rape and the Black Women's Rape Action Project, which has supported many women before and during their detention, said: \"We are hearing more stories of brutal treatment by immigration officers than before.\" </p> <p>Mark Scott, a solicitor with Bhatt Murphy, who is dealing with various claims against the Home Office, also said that the problem seemed to be worsening. </p> <p>But last night the Home Office said that all deportations were handled in accordance with the law, and denied the reports of ill-treatment.</p>",
  "Moqtada al-Sadr, Iraq's leading rebel Shia cleric, emerged last night in front of hundreds of his fighters in the main shrine in Najaf calling for a fight to the death - despite a tentative truce with the US military after more than a week of clashes. <p>Mr Sadr, whose right arm was bandaged in three places from an apparent shrapnel wound sustained earlier in the day, denounced the Americans and the Iraqi interim government and urged his fighters to stand firm. </p> <p>\"I advise the dictatorial, agent government to resign ... the whole Iraqi people demand the resignation of the government,\" Mr Sadr told fighters holed up in the Imam Ali shrine. </p> <p>\"We will remain here defending the holy shrines till victory or martyrdom,\" he said, according to an aide. </p> <p>The cordon of American tanks and Humvees surrounding the Old City appeared to have dispersed last night, but hundreds of Mr Sadr's militia held their positions on street corners. </p> <p>Earlier a procession of Mr Sadr's supporters was allowed to march past the previous American frontline through the city, kissing and embracing fighters, until they reached the golden-domed Imam Ali shrine that has been the focus of the uprising </p> <p>Ahmad al-Shaibani, one of the cleric's most senior lieutenants, said there was now a truce in place after nine days of fighting while negotiations were under way. </p> <p>\"There is an agreement and a truce,\" he said. \"The Americans accepted the truce. There is massive popular pressure on the Americans that has forced them to accept this truce.\" </p> <p>But he said Mr Sadr had warned his fighters to be cautious that the deal may be a \"trick\". The cleric also told his militia in other cities to continue their fight against the US-led multi-national force. </p> <p>Thousands of people took to the streets of Baghdad and other cities across the country, even in the Sunni heartland, yesterday to protest against the attack on the holy city of Najaf. </p> <p>Mouwaffak al-Rubaie, the government's national security adviser, and Hazem Shalan, the defence minister, were in Najaf yesterday talking to the cleric's senior deputies. </p> <p>But before they can reach a settlement Mr Sadr will have to agree to disband his militia and give up its weapons. </p> <p>The government must then decide whether to make him answer a charge of murder linked to the killing of a moderate Shia cleric in Najaf last year. </p> <p>Yesterday the interior minister, Falah al-Naqib, appeared to offer a way out. \"Syed Moqtada will not be touched if he leaves the shrine peacefully,\" he said. </p> <p>But that appeared unlikely last night, as Mr Sadr said: \"I will not leave this holy city.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr's Mahdi army has nine demands, including the withdrawal of the US military; an agreement to place Najaf under the control of the city's clerics before the militia withdraws; the release of militia prisoners; an amnesty for the fighters; and permission for Mr Sadr's movement to take part in next year's general elections. </p> <p>Some of the demands were still being negotiated last night. </p> <p>American commanders ad- mitted that their offensive was off - at least for now. </p> <p>\"We are allowed to engage the enemy only in self-defence and long enough to break contact,\" Major Bob Pizzitola from the US Army's 5th Cavalry Regiment said. \"That was a blanket order.\" </p> <p>While the crowd of Mr Sadr's supporters sang their way victoriously through the city, many of the people of Najaf were privately furious at the violence he has brought to their homes. </p> <p>\"Just yesterday we had fighting taking place here,\" said Watha Hassan, 28, a baker whose shop is close to Mr Sadr's home. \"The militia were hiding behind the houses and they put civilians like shields in front of them. </p> <p>\"We blame Moqtada al-Sadr for this violence. Even if there were only 2% of the infrastructure left in this country they would want it destroyed.\" </p> <p>Naji Yusuf, 74, who runs a small grocery store, was equally dismissive of the cleric. \"I blame people who are poor in mind. Most people do not support Moqtada al-Sadr. His people don't care about their religion, they just do what they want.\" </p> <p>Most people in Najaf follow Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, who is in London having heart surgery. Last night his office said the ayatollah was in a stable condition after angioplasty at the Harefield heart hospital.</p>",
  "<p>The threat of travel chaos at the height of the summer holiday getaway intensified yesterday as 3,000 British Airways check-in staff voted narrowly to strike over pay. </p> <p>Fresh efforts will be made on Monday to head off any stoppage, but the first strikes could hit the main airports the following week, with the August bank holiday at the end of the month likely to be a key target. </p> <p>The GMB members, most based at Heathrow and Gatwick, are expected to be joined by 8,000 members of the Transport and General Workers union at six airports, who will announce the results of a strike vote next week. </p> <p>The GMB's chief negotiator Allan Black said that his members, \"many of them women balancing a stressful service job with caring commitments at home\", had been left with no option. The unions have rejected a deal worth 8.5% over three years, or 10.5% if it does not count towards pensions. </p> <p>Mr Black admitted the 53% majority for strike action from a 48% turnout was not overwhelming, but added: \"Our members are not a naturally militant group. A lot will be thinking long and hard about saying yes to a strike in August. The last thing we wanted was to disrupt the customer.\" </p> <p>Union officials will meet GMB shop stewards on Monday to discuss a new but undisclosed proposal which might avert action. Possible strike dates will also be discussed. The GMB has three weeks in which to call a strike and must give seven days notice. </p> <p>BA, which earlier this week announced increased pre-tax profits of \u00a3115m for the three months to June urged the unions to continue negotiations, and said they were hopeful for form of resolution. </p> <p>\"Our travelling public do not deserve to be the victims and we will do everything in our power to ensure they are not,\" said Mike Street, BA's director of customer service and operations. \"We continue to talk to our unions and we urge them to accept our offer of independent arbitration - they should have nothing to fear.\" </p> <p>Travel industry representatives said they were hopeful that any strikes could be averted. \"Each summer we have a number of potential strikes,\" said a spokesman for Abta. \"Probably less than 5% of them go ahead.\" </p> <p>In July last year, a wildcat strike against a swipecard clocking on system is estimated to have cost BA \u00a340m and left tens of thousands stranded. </p> <p>If the threatened action does take place it will be the latest in a long line of miseries to affect air, road and rail travellers in the UK. </p> <p>Last week's severe storms, which saw 100 flights cancelled, left BA staff floundering to try and reunite passengers with a mountain of 7,000 suitcases that built up at Heathrow. The disruption was compounded by the breakdown of two baggage conveyor belts. </p> <p>And yesterday, travellers trying to reach the airport faced severe delays after a fatal stabbing on the London underground closed the Piccadilly line between Hounslow Central and Heathrow. Extra buses were laid on. </p> <p>There was some good news for bus passengers in South Yorkshire. TGWU members at First South Yorkshire accepted a revised pay offer, ending a three week strike, the longest continuous action by bus drivers for 30 years. </p> <p>Drivers, meanwhile, still had to contend with persistent rain across some parts of the country. Scotland, which was particularly badly hit, finally saw some sunshine, but southern central England and Wales faced fresh downpours, some of which were heavy.</p>",
  "<p>The paint had hardly dried on the shiny new facilities of the athletes' village when the first smudge appeared courtesy of the mystery of the missing Greeks. Hopes of this being the first drug-free games are dented - but not yet dashed. </p> <p>This is the first games in which the International Olympic Committee has taken control from the start with a testing programme running from July 30 to August 29. According to the IOC rules, the athletes' whereabouts must always be known by their national Olympic committee. The NOCs are required to share that information with the testing authorities appointed by the IOC. </p> <p>It should be simple enough: you know where your athletes are; you know when they are going to enter the village. If the team management is approached by the testers, you can send them in the right direction or produce the athlete at short notice. </p> <p>At previous games the testing programme began after the opening ceremony and finished the moment an athlete stopped competing. The IOC could realistically test an athlete only during the time they stayed in the village and the competition. Testing was based on competition and its results - the better an athlete did, the more likely a test. </p> <p>That changed with the Sydney Olympics in 2000. There was a proliferation of testing programmes by a multitude of agencies, testing athletes training and acclimatising in known venues in Australia. </p> <p>Testing during competition has always been regarded as a limited deterrent. If athletes know when they will be tested, they can clean up their act in time. </p> <p>For the Athens games the move to a defined time period when the IOC would take charge of testing was justified, particularly if it increases the testing period that athletes must be available for and reduces the queue of testing officers waiting for the same athlete. Such duplication of effort was not only a waste of resources but also a potential nightmare for those waiting on the test results. However, the IOC has missed a trick by not making an athlete's availability for testing a condition of eligibility for the games. </p> <p>According to the current anti-doping regulations, further evidence and decision-making is required to determine whether the rules have been violated when a test is missed. The IOC anti-doping rules also allow the athlete to be unavailable on two occasions during the games before a rule violation is committed. </p> <p>\"Strict liability\", whereby athletes are held responsible for substances in their body, still does not apply to missing a test. Then there is the review of the athletes' explanation as to why they did not show up, the most common being that they were not aware of it. A missed test sounds better than a failed test. </p> <p>So what would it take to design a really effective programme? At present athletes are not subject to a mandatory number of tests per year. They are now under a regime of more regular testing but the random approach provides loopholes through which the cheats can jump. </p> <p>The time has come to stop the cat-and-mouse chasing of athletes around the world. The mice must be tested regularly and this means being available regularly. </p> <p>Laboratories must be given a fighting chance. Presently they are testing samples blind; if they may have more than one sample belonging to the same athlete in the laboratory, they just do not know. The current testing programme is like shooting in the dark. </p> <p>The baton-passing of responsibility for information sharing - from athlete to NOC to testing authorities - creates an administrative nightmare. It is possible that an athlete can miss a test and yet have no idea the test was required. </p> <p>Testing must be regular and coordinated with the athlete's competitive programme and performances. If we move the random element from finding the athlete to randomly selecting which of their regularly collected samples to test, the deterrent would increase significantly. </p> <p>We must link up the samples in the laboratories to create a profile of the athletes. To achieve this would require better coordination of testing information and a less territorial attitude to anti-doping. It is the ultimate passport to complete forensic tagging of athletes. Are we willing to pay that price? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Michele Verroken is the former head of anti-doping for UK Sport</p>",
  "<p>These are the 15th Olympic Games that Jacques Rogge has attended as a competitor or official. For the first 13, as a modest sailor and behind-the-scenes administrator, he went largely unnoticed. But since replacing the octogenarian Juan Antonio Samaranch as the president of the International Olympic Committee three years ago he has found it impossible to keep out of the limelight - however much he might like to. </p> <p>At the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City two years ago, when he made his debut as president, Rogge found himself involved in the biggest judging controversy in the games' history when corrupt officials distorted the result of the pairs figure skating competition. </p> <p>Now, before he had the chance to declare open the games of the 28th summer Olympiad here last night and mark a return to their home after 108 years, the 62-year-old Belgian finds himself at the centre of the biggest doping scandal since Ben Johnson in 1988. </p> <p>This is the first time for nearly a quarter of a century that someone other than Samaranch has presided over the summer games and the winds of change are evident. Whereas Samaranch was a Machiavellian autocrat with a fascist background, Rogge is straightforward, consensus-driven and politically moderate. This is reflected in the style of presidency he has adopted: the management ethos, image and personal taste could be no more different from Samaranch's. </p> <p>Rogge, who competed as a yachtsman in three Olympics, came to power because he was known throughout the world as the clean face of the games. It is an image he is sustaining despite what must be overwhelming temptation to debase his values. </p> <p>When news filtered through on Thursday night that Kostas Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou, the reigning Olympic 100 metres silver medallist, had both missed doping tests it would have been far easier for Rogge to sweep the incident under the carpet. After all, he seemed to have been presented with the perfect opportunity to blame the Greek management after an official said they had not informed the athletes. Strip the manager of his games accreditation, warn the Greek Olympic committee and reiterate that this must not happen again. It would have led to a couple of days of bad headlines but would have avoided upsetting the Greek government, who after years of criticism about delays found their lavish opening ceremony overshadowed by a controversy surrounding the country's best-known athlete. </p> <p>\"There isn't much doubt he's prepared to face issues,\" said Craig Reedie, the chairman of the British Olympic Association and an IOC member. \"The fight against doping is one of his three main priorities.\" </p> <p>Rogge is far from alone in his determination. Over the past two years the tone of the fight against drugs in sport has changed. The World Anti-Doping Agency has been established to coordinate policy and sports that do not sign up to its code risk being excluded from the Olympics. </p> <p>There is some irony that Dick Pound, the head of Wada, is Rogge's partner in the task of eradicating drugs: he is the man Rogge defeated to become president at a meeting in Moscow. </p> <p>There was a brief stand-off between the two after Pound resigned from his IOC role as the head of marketing and chief negotiator of television rights after his defeat. But they are so committed to anti-doping that it was inevitable they would agree to work together. Pound is a powerful ally for Rogge to have within the organisation when there remain some IOC members who would gladly pretend the whole drugs issue does not exist. Rogge also found an unlikely ally this year in the shape of the US president George W Bush, who called for professional sports to banish drugs. Including an anti-doping directive in his State of the Union speech in January, along with weightier subjects, such as Iraq, terrorism, the economy and health care, clearly gave it a greater prominence. </p> <p>The president's message resonated with USA Track and Field, the sport's governing body in America, which has regularly been criticised for covering up positive dope tests. The establishment of an independent anti-agency doping in the US, modelled on the lines of Wada, has taken the responsibility away from USATF. </p> <p>Already this year 13 American athletes have been banned for failing tests, many of whom were connected with Balco, the San Francisco laboratory that also supplied Dwain Chambers with supplements. </p> <p>Gary Wadler, a prominent expert on doping in the US, said: \"There's a critical mass that's been developing. It just seems that the momentum has been growing and growing and this is like an exclamation point on this momentum.\" </p> <p>Within six months of taking office, Rogge began reshaping the IOC administration and setting out his top priorities as fighting doping, cutting the size and cost of the Olympics and reviewing the reforms enacted after the votes-for-favours Salt Lake City bid scandal. </p> <p>The determination of the former surgeon to cut out what he has described as \"the cancer\" of sport has led to him making greater strides in three years against stamping out doping than Samaranch achieved in nearly 30. </p> <p>For Rogge the easy option has never been a path he has been prepared to travel. In Salt Lake City two years ago he risked provoking a Russian walk-out after incurring the wrath of President Vladimir Putin, who wrote a letter of protest to Rogge when he awarded a second gold medal to Canada in the pairs figure skating after allegations of judging corruption in the original decision declaring the Russian pair winners. </p> <p>Rogge clearly has a core of steel running through him. That was visible more than 20 years ago when he was still a little-known sports administrator in Belgium. </p> <p>Belgium's Olympic team were under pressure from the government to boycott the 1980 Moscow games over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and, as the chef de mission, the casting vote fell to Rogge. Under huge pressure, he ignored the government and voted to go. \"The way you say no can be elegant,\" Rogge once said. \"It does not have to be brutal, rude or opening your big mouth. People should be judged by their results, not by the noise they make.\" </p> <p>Rogge has also not been shy of condemning athletes who associate with those linked to drugs, including Olympic champions such as Britain's Denise Lewis and the US's Marion Jones. It has led to bold headlines which must have been painful for him to read at times but he remains determined not to engage in cover-ups. \"The more cheats we catch the better. The more people we catch the more it shows our methods are working and the less people are likely to be prepared to try it.\" </p> <p>Rogge's term as president expires in 2009 but he can ask for a further four years just after the Beijing Olympics, an event already shrouded in human rights issues. His single-minded determination that the Olympics should be drug-free, transparent and devoid of corruption has, however, earned him some powerful enemies within the movement. </p> <p>There are early rumblings of a presidential challenger to Rogge and some IOC members have noted privately how much older he appears since assuming his role as lord of the rings. </p> <p>Last year he had a minor heart problem but is now back working 8am to 8pm six days a week, and has had only a handful of days off since taking power. \"If you saw my schedule you'd go home,\" he said yesterday. How the drugs cheats and corrupt Olympic officials must wish it was Rogge who was going home.</p>",
  "<p>Glagsow and Edinburgh, bitter rivals to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014, could stage the event jointly after new proposals were tabled at a meeting of Commonwealth sports ministers in Athens earlier this week. </p> <p>Joint bids are excluded under the rules of the Commonwealth Federation, but the general assembly is ready to consider a suggestion put forward at the meeting. This is designed to help poorer Commonwealth countries stage more major sports events, a proposal not unconnected with securing their votes for London's 2012 Olympic bid. </p> <p>\"We listened to what the ministers had to say and we will discuss it at the general assembly here in Athens on Tuesday,\" said Louise Martin, the chairman of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland. \"If we take it on board it could lead to a joint bid by Edinburgh and Glasgow.\" </p> <p>When Manchester hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games they spread events around the north-west, including events in Bolton and held the shooting at Bisley in Surrey. </p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong>While the sheer number of American athletes involved in drugs scandals is hard to keep up with, that is no excuse to mix up famous and infamous Olympians. Yet that is what Angela Rippon did when interviewing Britain's former top 400m runner Roger Black on ITV for a pre-Athens item on drugs. \"Didn't you feel cheated, though, Roger, after winning your silver medal in 1996 when Johnson, the winner, then tested positive?\" she asked, confusing the 1988 100m winner Ben Johnson, the most notorious drugs cheat in athletics history, with the unimpeachably clean Michael Johnson, who beat Black in Atlanta.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Monday</strong><br> </p> <p>International Olympic Committee testers turn up to test Kostas Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou in Chicago and discover they are not at the address they had claimed to be. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br> </p> <p>Kederis and Thanou arrive in Athens, presumably from Chicago where they claim to have been training. Strangely, the head of the Greek athletics association, Vasilis Sevastis, will say on Thursday night that \"Kederis was in Germany until yesterday\". </p> <p><strong>Thursday 3.20pm</strong><br> </p> <p>Kederis arrives at the Olympic village the day before the opening ceremony. He is one of the last to arrive. </p> <p><strong>6.15pm</strong><br> </p> <p>An IOC drug-testing team go to the rooms they believe Kederis and Thanou are occupying but find them empty. The IOC team notify officials of the athletes' absence and the Greek team management is contacted. </p> <p><strong> 9pm</strong><br> </p> <p>Rumours that Kederis has been involved in a testing incident begin to circulate in Athens. Radio and television stations report that he may have missed a test. The Greek sports minister Yiorgos Orfanos, below, says he is unaware of any problem involving Kederis and Thanou. IOC officials refuse to comment publicly but privately express little sympathy for the reigning Olympic 200m champion. \"It seems he didn't turn up for a test which, to me, is absolutely stupid. If he didn't turn up he's a fool and he deserves to be out,\" says one. </p> <p><strong>10pm</strong><br> </p> <p>The International Association of Athletics Federations secretary-general Istvan Gyulai blames team officials for failing to tell the athletes they should be available for testing. \"According to our information the Greek team leader was informed but not the athletes. To our mind this doesn't constitute a refusal,\" he says. </p> <p><strong>10.15pm </strong><br> </p> <p>Rumours as to the cause of the no-show circulate among journalists inside the Hilton hotel, the IOC's HQ in Athens and venue for an emergency meeting between IOC officials, including the president Jacques Rogge, and the Hellenic Olympic Committee. Rogge, arriving back from the Olympic torch-lighting ceremony at the Acropolis, declines to comment. Some sources indicate Kederis was not in the village because he was taking part in the ceremony, but there was no sign of him at the Acropolis. Conflicting reports place him at the house of his coach, Christos Tzekos. </p> <p><strong>10.45pm</strong><br> </p> <p>The HOC confirms the worst fears of the games organisers in a statement. It claims Kederis and Thanou left the village to go home to collect personal belongings and requested more time to provide samples. The HOC's statement reads: \"Today at 18.15 hours the IOC doping control representative came to the office of the chef de mission, Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, and stated that he was looking for the athletes Kostas Kederis and Katerina Thanou in order to proceed to sample collections as requested by the IOC, but he did not find either athlete in their rooms. Consequently, he handed over two doping control notifications. </p> <p>\"The chef de mission also searched for the athletes but they were not in their rooms. Then he informed Mr Stamatopoulos [Theodoros, the head of the Greek track team] who explained that the athletes left the Olympic village in order to collect some of their personal belongings from their home. Mr Stamatopoulos stressed that the athletes are coming back and asked for a few hours' extension.\" </p> <p><strong>11.50pm</strong><br> </p> <p>After the crisis meeting at the Hilton the IOC releases a statement confirming that Kederis and Thanou have a case to answer and that it is convening a disciplinary hearing for Friday morning. They are charged with being unavailable for testing and failing, \"without compelling justification, to submit to testing\". </p> <p><strong>12.15am </strong><br> </p> <p>Kederis and Thanou are involved in a motorcycle crash. TV reports later say they were on the balcony at Tzekos's house when he told them to return to the Olympic village as soon as possible. They used a motorbike, with Thanou riding pillion. It slid on a patch of oil outside the house and the sprinters were injured. </p> <p><strong>12.30am</strong><br> </p> <p>Papadoyiannakis tells NET television: \"There was no intention from the Hellenic Olympic Committee to hide anything. If there has been some kind of misunderstanding that's something different.\" </p> <p><strong>Friday 2.15am</strong><br> </p> <p>The Greek Olympic official George Gakis announces that the pair have been taken to hospital, above. Medical sources say Kederis sustained only \"a slight head injury, a sprain to the vertebra at the back of his neck, a knee sprain and scratches to his right leg\" and Thanou only \"slight abdominal injuries, a sprain to the right leg\". </p> <p><strong> 9.30am </strong><br> </p> <p>It is announced that the IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch visited the hospital to check on the sprinters' condition and served them with notice to attend a disciplinary hearing that day. He judged them fit to attend. </p> <p><strong>10am </strong><br> </p> <p>A statement from the hospital reveals Kederis has cranial trauma, whiplash and open wounds to the leg and Thanou has sustained a right hip and muscular injury. </p> <p><strong>11.10am </strong><br> </p> <p>Rogge hosts a welcome-to-the-games press conference in the main press centre which is initially dominated by questions about Kederis and Thanou.

  "<p><strong>The main event</strong><br> </p> <p>Even the BBC's arch-athlete Michael Johnson (grudgingly) thinks swimming may steal the Athens show, and the pool's two biggest stars, <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> and <strong>Ian Thorpe</strong>, go for their opening golds tonight in, respectively, the 400m individual medley (5.30pm) and 400m freestyle (5.54pm). </p> <p>Tomorrow there could be even bigger waves as the two giants are poised to clash in the 4x100m freestyle relay (7pm). </p> <p><strong>Brits in action</strong><br> </p> <p>The best hope of gold this weekend lies with Welsh cyclist <strong>Nicole Cooke</strong>, favourite for the women's 75-mile road race (1pm) despite this being her first Olympics. But be warned: while the 21-year-old won the Tour of Italy in July, this event can easily go against the odds. </p> <p>Before Cooke starts pedalling there are two decent medal hopes today: Commonwealth champion <strong>Craig Fallon</strong> in the under 60kg judo (from 8.30am), and<strong>Peter Waterfield </strong> and <strong>Leon Taylor</strong> in the synchronised 10m platform diving (8.15pm). </p> <p>This morning offers an early look at the form of Matthew Pinsent and the rest of the <strong>British men's four</strong> in their opening heat (9.50am), as well as our strong <strong>women's pair</strong> Cath Bishop and Kath Grainger (8.10am). </p> <p>Also starting their Olympics early are the Sydney sailing gold medallists<strong> Ben Ainslie</strong> (Finn class) and <strong>Shirley Robertson</strong> (keelboat Yngling), from 11am. </p> <p>Tomorrow, Sydney silver-medallist <strong> Ian Peel</strong> will aim to go one better in the trap shooting (final from 11.30am). </p> <p>Also in action:<strong>Tim Henman</strong> plays his first-round match against the Czech Jiri Novak, the <strong>GB men's hockey team</strong> sharpen their sticks against Egypt (6pm), and the <strong>men's eight</strong> and <strong>women's quadruple sculls</strong> begin their bids for rowing medals. </p> <p><strong> Other highlights</strong><br> </p> <p>Today's men's road race around central Athens (from 10.45am) sees Germany's <strong>Jan Ullrich</strong> freed of his nemesis Lance Armstrong and eager to defend his Sydney gold medal. </p> <p>And there's a first outing for the latest <strong>US basketball 'dream team' </strong> (slightly less dreamy than in the past, but still featuring the extraordinary talents of LeBron James) against Puerto Rico at 6pm tomorrow. </p> <p><strong> Weird and wonderful</strong><br> </p> <p>Not only will Australia's <strong>Andrew Hoy</strong> take on the world's top eventers when he starts his three-day event campaign tomorrow, he'll also be competing against his wife Bettina, a two-time German champion. Mr Hoy, bidding for a record fourth consecutive team gold, is staying in separate accommodation from his wife, but they still intend to 'swap tips'. </p> <p><strong> True Olympian</strong><br> </p> <p>At the age of 45, French cyclist <strong> Jeannie Longo</strong> has outdone even Sir Steven Redgrave for Olympic longevity. Like the rower, her first games was Los Angeles in 1984 and she hasn't missed one since, coming out of retirement to aim for an (admittedly unlikely) fifth medal in tomorrow's women's road race. </p> <p><strong> TV and radio</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Today:</strong> </p> <p>BBC1: live action from 7am-noon, 1.30pm-3, 5.15-7.15pm.

  "As the Olympic flame lit the Athens sky last night, the Greek sprinter Kostas Kederis was in the hospital bed he was admitted to in the early hours of yesterday morning. <p>Mystery surrounded the motorcycle crash which was said to have put him there and his failure to take a drug test, which will be the subject of an International Olympic Committee disciplinary hearing on Monday. </p> <p>Whatever the decision that panel comes to, the shadow cast over the 28th Olympiad by Kederis and his training partner, Ekaterini Thanou, is vast. </p> <p>Kederis, the reigning Olympic 200 metres champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the 2000 Olympics, are due to be released from hospital tomorrow, but they will emerge to find their reputations, not to mention their participation in the games, on the line. </p> <p>After a day of frantic developments in the Greek capital, it emerged that an IOC anti-doping team had tried to test Kederis and Thanou in Chicago earlier this week, but they were not at the address they had given to officials. </p> <p>If found guilty of the IOC's charge of twice \"refusing or failing without justification to provide a sample\" they face immediate expulsion from the games and a possible two-year ban from the sport. </p> <p>Before addressing the IOC, however, they will face questions from a disillusioned Greek public over the motorcycle crash that followed their failure to submit to a drug test at the Olympic village. </p> <p>Shortly after the sprinters arrived in the village on Thursday they were informed that they were required to take a random drug test. </p> <p>Subsequently testers could not find them in their rooms. The Greek Olympic team suggested at first that the sprinters had gone home to pick up some belongings and later that they had been needed along the route of the Olympic torch relay. </p> <p>The first precise news of their whereabouts came in the early hours of yesterday when it was announced they had been admitted to hospital after a road accident. </p> <p>Kederis and Thanou, who both emerged from obscurity to grab medals in Sydney, have long been suspected of avoiding drug testing, and last night few in Athens seemed willing to accept their version of events at face value. </p> <p>According to Christos Tsekos, the sprinters' controversial coach who has been implicated in the Balco drug scandal sweeping US athletics, Kederis and Thanou had been with him at his home in Athens when the drug testers called at the athletes' village. </p> <p>\"They had their cell phones turned off and didn't know they were being sought,\" Tsekos said yesterday. </p> <p>\"They were with me, they took the bike to get there [to the village] quickly and as you can see, frustration is the worst thing.\" </p> <p>Tsekos said Kederis lost control of the motorbike after slipping on a patch of oil near his house. They arrived at the KAT trauma hospital 15 miles away, rather than the much closer Voula hospital in Glyfada, at around 12.15am, but how they got there remains unclear. </p> <p>There were no records of any police emergency calls being logged in Glyfada on Thursday night, and the ambulance service confirmed it had not answered a call from Kederis or Thanou. </p> <p>Greek media last night reported that a passing motorist had driven the pair to the hospital but no one came forward to prove that theory. </p> <p>It was unclear whether Tsekos had taken them to the hospital, and the whereabouts of the motorcycle is unknown. </p> <p>There was also confusion about the extent of their injuries. A friend of Tsekis's said they had suffered only light injuries and had \"no problem\". </p> <p>Later however, following a visit to the hospital by Patrick Schamasch, the IOC's medical director, and Nikitas Kaklamanis, the Greek health minister, the hospital said the pair would be detained for 48 hours. </p> <p>The hospital said Kederis had suffered \"cranial trauma\", whiplash and wounds to his lower leg, and that Thanou sustained abdominal bruises, injuries to her right hip and a muscular injury to her right upper leg. </p> <p>The injury inflicted on Greek pride may be more serious, and the mood on the streets last night indicated public opinion was turning against athletes who were expected to be among the stars of the games. </p> <p>Not even the greatest of ancient tragedians could have written the script, most commentators agreed. </p> <p>Its timing, protagonists and whirlwind pace had made \"Greece freeze\", the mass-selling daily Eleftheros Typos declared. </p> <p>The Athens games had suddenly suffered \"the biggest wound imaginable\" said the paper. </p> <p>Another Athens daily, Ethnos, proclaimed in a banner headline: \"Kostas, Katerina, you owe it to all Greeks to prove that you are clean. Tell us the truth.\" </p> <p>The government tried to put on a brave face. Greece was about to celebrate the opening of \"a very great world event\" said its spokesman, Theodoris Roussopoulos. </p> <p>\"This is not a pleasant issue,\" he admitted. \"But as the home of the Olympics we subscribe to Olympic ideals and the rules and regulations apply to everyone.\" </p> <p>The IOC president Jacques Rogge insisted Monday's hearing would not be influenced by the high-profile of the athletes. </p> <p>\"The fact that Ms Thanou and Mr Kederis are Greek will have no impact whatsoever,\" he said. \"We do not bear in mind national distinctions or issues of prestige.\" </p> <p>The inquiry could be rendered irrelevant if, as some sources close to the Greek team suspect, Kederis announces his retirement over the weekend to spare himself and his country further humiliation. </p> <p>The IOC panel will examine the circumstances surrounding the drug-testing team's vain trip to the Olympic village on Thursday.</p> <p>Under IOC rules athletes are required to inform their national Olympic association of their whereabouts at all times, and be available for testing. </p> <p>Arne Ljungqvist, the IOC medical commission chairman, said that the drug testers had tried to find the athletes in Chicago a few days ago but couldn't. </p> <p>Mr Rogge declined to comment on reports that the IOC had written to them informing them that they would be tested on arrival in the village, and had been warned this was \"their final chance\". </p> <p>If the panel finds Kederis and Thanou wilfully evaded the testers, they face expulsion from the games and the sport. </p> <p>Last year Kederis and Thanou missed an out-of-competition drug test after informing anti-doping officials they would be training on Crete when they were in fact in Qatar. </p> <p>Neither athlete has tested positive for drugs. The IAAF general secretary, Istvan Gyulai, said Kederis passed two out-of-competition tests in the past 10 months, and Thanou passed two tests in the past seven months. </p> <p>Before attending last night's opening ceremony, Mr Rogge said: \"The games are much stronger than individuals.\" Over the next few days he will discover if he is right. </p> <p>Ekaterini Thanou arrived in Athens as one of the favourites for a gold in the 100 metres, with some of her main rivals absent, in part because of the drug scandal sweeping US athletics. </p> <p>Despite success indoors and at the European Championships Thanou had never claimed gold at a global championship outdoors and Athens looked to be her big chance. </p> <p>Thanou, 29, is an Athenian and in front of her home crowd was hoping to go one better than Sydney were she collected silver in the 100m. She was also due to be part of Greece's 4x100m relay team. </p> <p>Her first love at university was traditional Greek dancing but her talent for athletics became obvious at the Institute of Sporting Science and Physical Education. Her entire career has been under the tutelage of coach Christos Tzekos. </p> <p>In 1999 she became in door world champion with victory over 60 metres in 6.96 seconds - the fourth-fastest time ever. She won the most recent of her three European championship 100m golds in 2001. </p> <p>Thanou collected a pair of world championship bronzes, in 1999 and 2001, but finished outside the medals at the Paris world championships last year after missing much of the season with leg and waist injuries. </p> <p>An air force officer with a low profile away from competitive action, Thanou is married to Thanasis Karachristos, a footballer.</p>",
  "<p>The United States Olympic Committee has told its athletes to tone down their patriotism. Jason Read, a member of the US men's rowing eight, expects he will find the instruction harder to follow than most of his colleagues. \"If we win it will be the greatest, the most surreal, moment of my life and I expect my reaction will be intense,\" he says, before adding the diplomatic after-thought. \"But I'll also remember that we are guests in Greece. We must also be respectful at all times.\" </p> <p>If the Olympic hosts knew even a little of Read's recent personal history they would probably forgive him his exuberance in victory. </p> <p>On September 11 2001, the 26-year-old voluntary fireman and rescue services administrator was woken from his jet-lagged sleep by the sound of his mother crying at the television news reports. He had just returned to the family home in New Jersey from the world rowing championships in Lucerne. </p> <p>\"I was dispatched to set up a field hospital near the Statue of Liberty later that morning, but when it became obvious that very few people had survived we broke down the hospital and went to the Twin Towers to help with the rescue operation.\" </p> <p>Read spent the next five days searching through the rubble but found no survivors, only body parts. It was, he says, a life-changing experience, one that gave him a new outlook on his sporting career and intensified his already strong sense of his American identity. </p> <p>\"The day after the attacks some of the firemen raised the star-spangled banner in the rubble. It was a battered and torn old flag but it helped give me orientation around the site. It also served as my beacon of hope in my life. </p> <p>\"Since then, I have appreciated my sport even more than I did before. I've learned to appreciate the time I get to spend with my team-mates. If I had the chance to stand alongside them on the medal podium as that flag was raised, and to be able to sing our national anthem . . . well I don't think I'd be able to sing. I would be crying my eyes out.\" </p> <p>Read's sentiments might sound overly mawkish to cynical European ears but they are hardly unusual among a population raised on the notion that the US is the greatest nation in the world. Remember, this is a country in which children pledge allegiance to the flag every day of their school lives, where every sporting event - from little league baseball to the NBA finals - is preceded by the playing of that hymn to the US's enduring greatness, the Star-Spangled Banner. </p> <p>Their patriotism has only been ratcheted up since the US invasion of Iraq (especially among those Americans who support George W Bush's military adventure). So, too, have feelings of anti-Americanism, not least among the Greek population, which has long been ambivalent towards US military bases in Greece and Washington's pro-Israel policy in the Middle East. </p> <p>US officials in Athens are clearly concerned that such feelings would be intensified by the sight of gold-medal winning Americans, flags draped around their shoulders, rubbing their athletic supremacy in the face of the world. No wonder they haven't missed an opportunity over the last few days to restate publicly their instructions to their competitors: no mocking or belittling opponents, no disputing officials' decisions, no walking the streets of the Greek capital in team tracksuits and no excessive flag-waving - a mantra repeated yesterday by the USOC's chief executive Jim Scherr. \"We have no objection to the flag being displayed on their victory laps. But the flag is not a headband or a turban.\" </p> <p>And nor, it seems, is it suitable for display around the athletes' village. Though the emblems of other nations are everywhere - hanging up in windows, draped over balconies - the stars and stripes are conspicuously absent. </p> <p>As part of the preparations for the games, some members of the US team received advice on relaxation techniques that might help them better handle hostile crowds. They were also offered etiquette lessons aimed at helping them become more gracious winners. </p> <p>One US athlete who might have benefited from the guidance is the sprinter Maurice Greene, who, along with the other members of the US 4x100m gold-medal team in 2000, provoked widespread criticism with his post-victory preening. \"What [they did] was completely improper and we have taken great measures to make sure our athletes don't repeat that mistake,\" Scherr said. </p> <p>Greene subsequently claimed to regret his behaviour in Sydney, though his statements this week could hardly be described as contrite. \"No athlete knows what they will do after they win a medal. Nothing is planned - it's all done on emotion.\" </p> <p>But it would be wrong to single out Greene for particular criticism. Speak to any US athlete in Athens and it is evident that, whatever officials might say in press conferences, the athletes themselves are having some difficulty grasping the notion that the mightiest nation in the world has suddenly been transformed into the meekest. </p> <p>The likes of Jason Read might have a shaky grasp on the language of international diplomacy. Others have none at all. \"I'm an American and I'm not going to tone that down,\" says Jim Gruenwald, who is competing in the Greco-Roman wrestling. \"Being an American means we are free. We have a right to express an opinion.\" </p> <p>Daryl Szarenski, a member of the US shooting team, competed at Sydney, where he finished 25th. A victory this time would be a lifetime's ambition fulfilled. </p> <p>\"Listen, if I win the gold medal in my event you'll have to scrape me off the ceiling with a spatula,\" he grinned. \"I don't care what anyone says - if I win I ain't hiding.\"</p>",
  "<p>Blood doping tests on a number of leading cyclists at the Olympics had to be cancelled yesterday because the doping inspector was not allowed into the Olympic Village, the International Cycling Union said. </p> <p>\"We had everything ready - the commissioner and the doctor and the riders were there but the inspector was not allowed to go in,\" said a UCI spokesman, Enrico Carpani. </p> <p>The inspector was refused entry because of a problem with his credentials, Carpani said. \"We were very disappointed. We invest a lot of time and money in the controls. Between him and the riders there was a door and he could not go through it.\" </p> <p>It was too late to administer the tests later yesterday because such blood samples have to be taken early in the morning. </p> <p>\"We were standing there with our five riders, but after 20 minutes still no one had shown up,\" said the Dutch team doctor Tjeert de Vries. Riders from the Italian, French and Belgian teams were also waiting in vain. </p> <p>Cycling has been hit by a series of doping scandals over the past months and several gold medal contenders, most notably Britain's David Millar, have had to pull out of the games because of doping admissions. </p> <p>Yesterday's test had been planned well in advance and was not an unannounced, out-of-competition control. </p> <p>Carpani stressed that overall cooperation with the IOC was \"very good\". </p> <p>A Russian athlete and a modern pentathlete failed recent dope tests, Russian Olympic officials said yesterday, giving details of previously announced cases. Neither is a member of the Olympic squad in Athens.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Scotland could double up for 2014 games bid</strong></p> <p>Glasgow and Edinburgh, bitter rivals to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014, could stage the event jointly after new proposals were tabled at a meeting of Commonwealth sports ministers in Athens earlier this week. </p> <p>Joint bids are excluded under the rules of the Commonwealth Federation, but the general assembly is ready to consider a suggestion put forward at the meeting. This is designed to help poorer Commonwealth countries stage more major sports events, a proposal not unconnected with securing their votes for London's 2012 Olympic bid. </p> <p>\"We listened to what the ministers had to say and we will discuss it at the general assembly here in Athens on Tuesday,\" said Louise Martin, the chairman of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland. \"If we take it on board it could lead to a joint bid by Edinburgh and Glasgow.\" </p> <p>When Manchester hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games they spread events around the north-west, including events in Bolton and held the shooting at Bisley in Surrey. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>While the sheer number of American athletes involved in drugs scandals is hard to keep up with, that is no excuse to mix up famous and infamous Olympians. Yet that is what Angela Rippon did when interviewing Britain's former top 400m runner Roger Black on ITV for a pre-Athens item on drugs. \"Didn't you feel cheated, though, Roger, after winning your silver medal in 1996 when Johnson, the winner, then tested positive?\" she asked, confusing the 1988 100m winner Ben Johnson, the most notorious drugs cheat in athletics history, with the unimpeachably clean Michael Johnson, who beat Black in Atlanta. </p> <p><strong>England stay silent on Grewcock</strong></p> <p>During England's ill-starred tour of the southern hemisphere in June the management made clear they would be having a stern word with their bad-boy lock Danny Grewcock about his disciplinary record. Almost two months later the Bath second row, banned until August 31 for stamping on the All Black Daniel Carter in Auckland, has still not heard from the England coach Sir Clive Woodward. </p> <p>\"Clive did say he was going to speak to me but I haven't spoken to him yet,\" said Grewcock, currently on tour in South Africa with Bath despite being ineligible for their two scheduled games. </p> <p>\"We'll wait and see whether it affects my England future, I can't predict that. If England ask me to go back and train, cool. If they don't, I'll just have to concentrate on playing well for my club.\" </p> <p>Bath, for their part, insist there is no hidden agenda behind their decision not to re-appoint the 31-year-old as club captain this season but Grewcock surely cannot afford to put a boot out of place once he retakes the field. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Do not bet on Bath, led by Olly Barkley, reaching the final of today's Middlesex Sevens at Twickenham.

They're always snootily telling everybody just how much better they are than everybody else in the paddock when it comes to managing drivers - well let's see.

  "<p>Almost any business, organisation or project can be jeopardised by internal saboteurs. These treacherous workers (who are often managers) are extremely subtle and often only noticed when it is too late. </p> <p>In many cases, not until turnover has dropped or a project failed, or even after the competition has provided something better and cheaper, does it become painfully obvious that someone has undermined the work process. Saboteurs are experts in making things go wrong. </p> <p>Are you working alongside a saboteur? You will be if a German bestseller by Marco von M\u00fcnchhausen and Herman Scherer, called The Little Saboteurs (Die kleinen Saboteure, Campus 2003), is anything to go by. The authors reckon every firm has got them and for the success of the business, they should be rooted out. And the phenomenon applies just as much to the UK as Germany. </p> <p>Saboteurs generally spring into action at any hint of change. No matter what is supposed to be altered and why, even before a final decision has been made, the saboteur is ready with reasons not to proceed. </p> <p>A simple example shows how this works. Consultants propose wide-ranging changes to the sales force structure which entail a lot of work for some people. Saboteurs can then use the \"impossibility tactic\" to great effect. They will claim that: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> it's impossible to change our sales force structure<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> no company could do this<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> the IT section wouldn't cope <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> it will fail in the market <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> others have failed trying to do exactly the same thing. </p> <p>All this means the saboteur has no responsibility to do anything. After all, it won't work and anyone who tries will fail. This self-fulfilling prophecy has proven very reliable over the years. </p> <p>In Germany, the entire economic reform process has been plagued by such problems. Vested interests have undermined efforts at reforming the taxation and healthcare systems, civil service and property market. The prob lem is so serious that a special company (Plaschna Management KG) was established to prevent the government from interfering in managerial decision making in state-owned enterprises. </p> <p>It's far from just a public sector issue. Spectacular examples of disastrous mismanagement caused partly or even substantially by internal sabotage abound in the private sector too. </p> <p>This month, a major survey of German executives revealed massive resistance to increased financing through private equity. Even where there are clear advantages for the company as a whole, because of risk aversion and a perceived threat to their own divisions and jobs, many internal stakeholders frantically resist the change. </p> <p>Change consultant Lindsay McKenna of <a href=\"http://www.lindsay.com\">lindsay.com</a> says that similar problems abound in the UK. A British company tried to introduce powerful new financial software, without justifying the need for it or explaining the benefits. The saboteurs moved into full inertia mode and nine months later, the old system was still being used. The impact on efficiency was crippling. </p> <p>Senior executives can be just as bad. Ms McKenna cites the case of a financial director buttonholing his managing director in the corridor and persuading him to reverse a decision that would jeopardise his years of internal \"empire building\". The classic \"old boy\" loyalties prevailed over rational reorganisation. </p> <p>There are many impressive weapons in the saboteur's arsenal which can only be mentioned briefly here. Firstly, there is the incredibly vague formulation. \"We'll try to implement this project\" really means the polar opposite. Likewise, keeping an eye on costs means spending the same as usual. A promise to have regular meetings may really be kept, but nothing will come out of them. </p> <p>The saboteur lives by all manner of delaying tactics using his own style of language. By phrasing everything in terms of \"woulds\", \"coulds\", \"ifs\" and \"mights\", it is possible not only to avoid decision-making, but to postpone everything indefinitely. </p> <p>Here are some prime examples of statements designed to ensure nothing ever happens or changes: \"That could work if we tripled our turnover\"; \"We first need a series of seminars on the subject\" or \"We would need the approval of x-number of people\" or \"we could probably do this the year after next\". </p> <p>Even if a decision does somehow get made, saboteurs ensure it is quickly forgotten and sinks into obscurity or sabotage its implementation. Diversion tactics, slowing things down to a snail's pace, or bureaucratising any process into total inertia are reliable methods of ensuring a stable status quo. </p> <p>For example, before anything can be done, it's necessary to gather masses of data. Not only will the gathering process last forever, but the interpretation can clog up the system beyond eternity. \"There's no rush\" is an attitude that can be maintained until hell freezes over. And by then it's too late. </p> <p>Missing the boat is also no problem for saboteurs, be cause they never assume responsibility for anything. They always find suitable scapegoats so they themselves remain undetected. </p> <p>Fortunately, there are proven remedies for coping and dealing with saboteurs. Getting them to change their views and behaviour is extremely difficult, but it is possible to stop them having their way. </p> <p>The first step is to identify the presence of saboteurs and understand their strategies and tactics. They can often be circumvented through honest counter-espionage. </p> <p>Simultaneously informing others about the saboteurs is a double-edged strategy which can work wonders. Saboteurs often have a fairly limited sphere of influence. By uniting the forces of progress against them, sufficient pressure may be exerted so that things proceed as they should. </p> <p>Also, provided the saboteur is not the boss and that those with authority understand what is happening, they can override delaying tactics, resistance to change and so on. </p> <p>All management processes must be explicit, transparent and measurable. Because the saboteur thrives in a woolly and vague environment, the more clearly all variables are specified, the harder it is to evade and paralyse them. </p> <p>If a targeted sales increase is set at 20% within two years, fully justified in terms of the market, competition and internal resources, it is difficult to prevent reasonable actions being taken to achieve it. </p> <p>Good communication can help too. Even if somewhat one-sided at times, only the deadliest saboteurs are totally immune to open communication, apologies and an acceptance of mistakes. </p> <p>The difficulty of dealing with serious attempted sabotage should not be underestimated. But an appropriately applied mixture of sound communication, monitoring and control, and evading the evasion tactics, can go a long way towards sabotaging the saboteurs. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Further reading: Beyond the Wall of Resistance, by Rick Maurer, Bard Press, 1996.

  "It's the bit of car ownership that you never see in the glossy magazine adverts. You take delivery of your brand new car and before you've got a few miles down the road you find yourself back at the dealer and trying to get the windscreen wipers to work. <p>A few days later, water starts pouring in through the driver's door, and the final indignity, it breaks down on the motorway. </p> <p>They used to be called \"Friday afternoon cars\" - those produced by workers desperate to get away quickly for the weekend. Even in these days of round-the-clock car production, most factories still seem to churn out the odd lemon. </p> <p>While it's tempting when you collect a new car to grab the keys and make for the open road, an hour spent diligently examining the bodywork and making sure everything works, is time well spent. </p> <p>Check the paintwork is regular and unmarked and that the panels are properly aligned - and only sign to take delivery once you are happy. </p> <p>However, that will only reveal so much. Newspaper motoring sections regularly feature stories of readers who take their car back to the supplying dealer 15 times to no avail - but what should you do if it happens to you? </p> <p>The Supply of Goods Act 1994 and its update (Sale and Supply of Goods to Consumers Regulations 2002) state that a car has to be \"as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality\" at the time of delivery. </p> <p>Clearly, if the car won't drive properly or the doors leak water every time it rains, then you are perfectly in your rights to reject it. </p> <p>The act actually protects the buyer for up to six years, although, in practical terms, most buyers will want to return the car within six months. </p> <p>If the buyer returns the car within that period, the burden of proof is on the dealer to show the car was fit for purpose. </p> <p>Shaheen Musaret, a lawyer who works for the Consumers' Association, suggests unhappy buyers park the vehicle in a safe place then advise the dealer that you are rejecting it, and that it will be returned when the purchase price is refunded. </p> <p>\"This is a huge problem and we currently get 20 calls a day on this issue - and it's very difficult to advise on, as each claim is different. </p> <p>\"Generally, the quicker the claim is made the more chance it has of succeeding. </p> <p>\"We suggest buyers don't let the dealer try and sort out the problem but reject it as soon as they unearth the major fault. Some dealers will do anything to drag out proceedings so that they can argue the buyer is out of time. </p> <p>\"It you are going to let them try and resolve the problem, put it in writing that you reserve the right to reject the car if it fails to remedy the problem.\" </p> <p>She says those who buy their cars on hire purchase agreements have an extra level of protection as they can also reject the car to its legal owner - the finance house. </p> <p>\"It will all depend on what's considered reasonable. If you've done several thousand miles the dealer will argue that you've consented to accept the car and can no longer reject it in favour of a full refund.\" </p> <p>Even if you've covered a few thousand miles, you are still within your rights to seek compensation if the car is unfit for use - although Ms Musaret suggests you are unlikely to get a full refund. </p> <p>Lastly, it should be noted that you will not be able to successfully reject the car unless the problems is considered serious. </p> <p>If you simply no longer like it, or it suffers from one minor problem, you are unlikely get your money back. </p> <p><b>Look east for reliability</b></p> <p>The Consumers' Association has named the UK's most unreliable car manufacturers and it makes grim reading for those who bought supposedly reliable German marques. </p> <p>Japanese manufacturers continue to top the table. Honda, Mazda, Lexus and Toyota have been joined by Suzuki for the first time in the \"excellent\" list. </p> <p>But the other end of the table German brands are no longer living up to their dependable reputation. </p> <p>VW dropped into the lowest category last year, and has been joined by BMW and Audi - which has dropped two places in two years. </p> <p>Ford is the only non-Far Eastern manufacturer to be named as excellent or good. </p> <p>In alphabetical order, the manufacturers named by Which? as\"poor\" are: </p> <p>Audi (1,009) <br>BMW (1,388) <br>Chrysler (140) <br>Citro\u00ebn (1,243)<br>Daewoo (266) <br> Fiat (694) <br>Land Rover (493) <br>Peugeot (1,932) <br>Renault (2,096)<br>Rover (1,252)<br>Saab (469) <br>Vauxhall (2,610) <br>VW (2,610) </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Source: The Consumers' Association.

  "<p>Hundreds of people are packed into the posh ballroom of a central London hotel. Camera crews and reporters from the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 squeeze into the room. Sharp-suited flunkies jostle pass, handing out official-looking documents. </p> <p>Then as the microphones are switched on, the giant screens beam out and the super-bright TV camera lights blaze across the room as the event begins. </p> <p>A major press conference? An announcement of global importance? No: all that's going on is the sale of dilapidated ex-housing association stock from around the country. In housing-mad Britain, property auctions are now more popular than West End shows. </p> <p>The BBC is here filming \"Homes under the Hammer\", ITV is recording \"House Price Challenge\" while Channel 4's Sarah Beeney is fronting the latest \"Property Ladder\" series. </p> <p>The premise behind the reality shows is that with careful research plus a bit of luck you'll probably pick up a bargain at an auction. </p> <p>But the truth is that the bargains disappeared long ago; intense competition between private buyers, buy-to-let investors and builders and developers is pushing auction prices to levels sometimes much in excess of what you'd pay at a local estate agent. </p> <p>Camilla Nicholls is waiting for Lot 25a to come up. It's a penthouse flat in the Barbican complex on the fringes of the City of London. It's only 500sq ft, with two rooms and a kitchen and bathroom, and (like almost every other property in the auction) it needs \"upgrading\". </p> <p>Camilla's been hunting for a Barbican flat for ages. She'd been tempted by an Evening Standard article a few days before the auction teasingly headlined \"Bargain in the Barbican\". The guide price is \u00a3250,000, substantially below the levels being fetched by other similar apartments in the sixties-built complex. </p> <p>But as bidding begins, Camilla finds herself up against two other determined buyers. She has set herself a \u00a3310,000 ceiling. But as the bidding spirals, she breaks the golden rule, and breaches her own maximum price. </p> <p>But even then it's not enough. She pulls out at \u00a3312,000 and is astonished to see the price continue to march up. Eventually the hammer comes down at \u00a3325,000. </p> <p>\"I've been looking for a Barbican flat for some time. There's not much stock available and people are obviously going a bit bonkers. It went for a very high price, particularly considering the condition it is in. I went to have a look at it and it needed a lot of work. I have seen a very similar one in perfect condition that went for \u00a3330,000. I'd be very surprised if you'd get more than \u00a3310-315,000 if you'd try to sell this one through an estate agent.\" </p> <p>Every lot at the auction, held by FPD Savills, went for considerably more than the guide price. As a rule of thumb, auction goers should take the guide price and add around 30% extra to get a more realistic picture of what the property will fetch. </p> <p>Plenty of properties go for 50% or more above guide prices. Parcels of land can achieve spectacular prices: a five acre football pitch plus small clubhouse in Perivale, west London leased for the next 35 years to Hanwell Town Football Club and producing a rental income of \u00a311,000 a year is in the brochure at a guide price of \u00a3140,000. </p> <p>However, amid frenetic bidding it fi nally sells for \u00a3739,000. Assuming the football club sticks to its leasing deal, the buyer will earn an annual income of 1.5% on his investment, before costs. </p> <p>FPD Savills holds auctions in London and Nottingham every month. But they are dwarfed by the auctions run by Allsops, which last year raked in nearly \u00a31bn in sales - which is its highest figure ever. </p> <p>Allsops spokeswoman Rhoda Katz says: \"In the early 1990s it was nearly all repossessions and prices were very realistic. But they have all but disappeared and now it's mostly ex-local authority and housing association stock. </p> <p>\"We are seeing many more members of the general public competing against investors and developers, so prices are now much closer to what you'd expect to see at an estate agent.\" </p> <p>Allsops now sends out nearly 100,000 catalogues either online or in hard copy to prospective buyers for every one of its auctions. It suggests that if you want to make money from an auction, it's probably better to be the seller than the buyer - and Ms Katz says the serious money is already abandoning residential property in favour of higher-yielding commercial property. </p> <p><strong>Buying: You must set a price and stick to it</strong></p> <p>Buying a property at auction is the same process as buying from an estate agents. The only difference is that the timeframe is much, much shorter. </p> <p>The major auctions are held in London, although the property for sale will be from around the country. The auctioneers' websites usually offer printable on-line catalogues listing dates and prices. You can also register to obtain hard copy catalogues. </p> <p>The main auction houses are Allsop (<a href=\"http://www.allsop.co.uk\">allsop.co.uk</a>), FPD Savills (<a href=\"http://www.fpdsavills.co.uk\">fpdsavills.co.uk</a>) and Sequence (sequencehome.co.uk) which acts for a number of auction houses across the country, including Derby, Spalding, Southampton, Brighton and London. For example, it includes the auctions held by Barnard Marcus in London and Fox &amp; Sons in Brighton. </p> <p>A number of websites promise to alert you to every auction held around the country. Essential Information Group (<a href=\"http://www.eigroup.co.uk\">eigroup.co.uk</a>) says it is the leading \"one stop shop\" for auctions, covering 25,000 lots for sale each year. But it is a subscriber service, costing \u00a3125 for three months. </p> <p>Elsewhere, scores of property websites promise to find you bargains, but most of the examples given are dated in the extreme. Treat them with caution. And bin the fax-back services which, for an expensive premium-rate call, will print out the catalogues available free elsewhere. </p> <p>The catalogues tend to come out just three weeks before an auction. The auctioneer will provide dates when you can view the property. If you like it, it is recomended that you instruct a surveyor (go to <a href=\"http://www.rics.org.uk\">rics.org.uk</a>) to carry out a Homebuyers report, while your solicitor should carry out checks on deeds, covenants and restrictions. </p> <p>Now arrange the finance. If you buy at auction, you have to immediately pay a 10% deposit. This can't be cash, for money laundering reasons, so it's best to obtain a bankers' draft. The 90% balance has to be paid within 28 days. </p> <p>You can submit a bid before the auction, which may be accepted. At the auction, you should set your upper price limit and stick to it rigidly. If you are the highest bidder, you are legally bound to complete the sale on the day and under the terms stipulated in the contract. </p> <p>If the bids are below the reserve price, the property will be withdrawn, but you may be able to negotiate with the seller and buy the property by private treaty. </p> <p><strong>Selling: Offers speed, clarity and a wider audience</strong></p> <p>In Australia, property auctions are the chief method in which houses are sold. </p> <p>As more private buyers and investors pack the auction houses in the UK, it may now be the time to seriously consider putting your home up for sale through an auction. </p> <p>Chris Berriman, senior auctioneer at Allsop, says auction sales have three main advan tages. The first is speed. The process will only take seven weeks from the date you put it in the brochure to the point where you receive all the cash. </p> <p>Secondly, you enjoy greater clarity; after the final bid, the price can't be renegotiated or \"gazundered\" and thirdly, your details of your property are marketed to as many as 70,000 potential buyers compared to a window in a estate agents. </p> <p>But there are considerable drawbacks. Most of the buyers at auctions are individuals and developers looking to do up run-down properties. There are not many buyers in the market for freshly decorated and upgraded homes. </p> <p>Brian Grant of Barnard Marcus Auctions says: \"We see properties in too good a condition for us to take to auction. For us to accept it, we will want to set a reserve price below the market price, and many sellers are not prepared to do that.\" </p> <p>Fees can also be high. You will have to pay for a quarter-page advert in the auctioneer's catalogue, usually around \u00a3200-\u00a3250, rising to \u00a31,000 for a full page. </p> <p>Then there's the auctioneer's commission. This is usually 2-2.5%, which is equal to, or more, than the rate you may pay for an estate agents. The rate is negotiable - the local authorities whose stock provides the anchor for most auctions are believed to pay next to nothing. Even if it fails to sell you may be required to pay certain costs. </p> <p>You will have to instruct a solicitor who will obtain the title deeds and prepare the special conditions of sale. </p> <p>You will need to register your property with an auction house at least six weeks beforehand to have it included in a catalogue. Choose the auctioneer carefully. They will carry out a price appraisal, but don't be overly tempted by the one which quotes the highest price. </p> <p>You will then set a reserve price, which will remain confidential and not be disclosed at the auction. </p> <p>If your property is sold, the auctioneer will collect a 10% deposit from the buyer. Your solicitor will arrange for payment of the commission, and after his own fees are deducted will send you the balance within 28 days of the sale. </p> <p><strong>Don't be seduced by the guide price</strong></p> <p><strong> West Denton, Newcastle </strong><br><strong>Guide price:</strong> \u00a380,000<br><strong> Achieved price:</strong> \u00a3119,500<br>A three-bedroom house in need of updating.

Local agents <strong>Besley Hill Estate Agents</strong> say: \"To me it sounds like a lot of money - a very very high price. I know of nothing in St Anne's going for that kind of price unless it was going for development.\" </p> <p><strong> Barbican, London </strong><br><strong> Guide price:</strong> \u00a3250,000<br><strong> Achieved price:</strong> \u00a3325,000<br>A leasehold 7th floor penthouse flat requiring upgrading. Two rooms, kitchen, bathroom. Local agents <strong>Frank Harris &amp; Co</strong> say: \"The person who bought the property in auction has paid close to top price. However it was in a very good location in one of the best blocks.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong> Research by Ramya Puttanna </strong> </p> <p><strong>How you can go about financing a deal</strong></p> <p>One of the most daunting prospect for buyers at auction is arranging the finance. The person making the successful bid is required to pay an immediate 10% deposit, and must pay the remaining 90% within 28 days. </p> <p>If they fail to come up with the money within that timeframe, they automatically lose the 10% deposit - and can then be sued for the vendor's losses. </p> <p>In theory, the owner can put then put it up for sale in the next auction, sell it for \u00a3100,000 less and sue the previous failed buyer for the difference. </p> <p>High street banks and building societies will frequently take longer than 28 days to release funds, so the risk to the buyer is enormous. </p> <p>Stepping in to fill the gap are a number of mortgage brokers which specialise in arranging auction loans, and they often set up desk at auctions to attract customers. </p> <p>They promise to arrange the same sort of cheap mortgage deals that other borrowers can access - but do so within the crucial 28-day turn around. They will also charge a fee of around 1% of the value of the loan. </p> <p>Paul Stockwell of Savills Private Finance (spf.co.uk) says: \"Some banks and building societies will take as long as three months to process an application. Brokers like us know what service standards are at the various lenders and have the contacts to speed things up if things are going wrong.\" </p> <p>The process the customer follows is exactly the same as for any other mortgage application, but at double speed. The broker takes the client's details, finds the lender currently offering the best deal, and obtains an 'in principle' loan offer. </p> <p>\"The lender will carry out a credit check, and we have to make sure we get all the paperwork - such as confirmation of income and bank statements - over as soon as possible,\" says Mr Stockwell. </p> <p>A valuation has to be done prior to the auction which is acceptable to the lender. If the buyer bids over the pre-agreed valuation, they will have to stump up the extra cash independently. </p> <p>An alternative is to arrange a bridging loan which lets the buyer bid in the confidence that if their main mortgage finance fails to arrive on time they will not forfeit the deposit. </p> <p>Fincorp (<a href=\"http://www.fincorp.co.uk\">fincorp.co.uk</a>) arranges non-status bridging loans lasting one day to one year, with most loans lasting only a matter of weeks. Most of its customers are buy-to-let investors. But short-term finance is not cheap - Fincorp charges 1.5% per month or 18% per annum.</p>",
  "<p>A journalist from the New York Times has been drawn into an official inquiry set up to establish the source of an illegal leak from the White House, raising fears that the investigation is becoming an attack on the right of reporters to protect their sources. </p> <p>Judith Miller has received a grand jury subpoena, joining other journalists facing the threat of jail in a politically sensitive investigation into the leaking of an undercover CIA operative's name to a columnist in July last year. </p> <p>This week Matthew Cooper, a journalist for Time magazine, was found in contempt of court and ordered to be jailed and fined $1,000 (\u00a3543) a day until he agrees to testify to the investigation. </p> <p>But a judge suspended the sentence pending an appeal. Two other journalists have also been subpoenaed. </p> <p>Neither Mr Cooper nor Ms Miller broke the story which triggered the investigation into the outing of the undercover CIA agent, Valerie Plame. </p> <p>Under US law, exposure of a covert operative is punishable by a 10-year prison term. </p> <p>Ms Plame's cover was blown when two Bush administration officials disclosed her identity to Robert Novak, a syndicated conservative columnist. </p> <p>Her husband, Joe Wilson, a former ambassador, accused the Bush administration of leaking her name as retribution for his refusal to support the White House in building the case for war in Iraq. </p> <p>Media commentators see the legal threat against Mr Cooper as especially grave because his story was on the abuse of power by Bush administration officials. </p> <p>His lawyer, Floyd Abrams, said yesterday that the special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, risked undermining a basic journalistic principle. </p> <p>\"I find it deeply disturbing the visage of one journalist after another being called in and being obliged to choose between being incarcerated or violating a promise of confidentiality,\" he said. </p> <p>Although the focus of the investigation this week was journalists, the White House has also come under scrutiny. </p> <p>So far, President George Bush, the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and the secretary of state, Colin Powell, have been interviewed, along with White House aides. </p> <p>Yesterday, the New York Times said it would fight the subpoena. </p> <p>\"Journalists should not have to face the prospect of imprisonment for doing nothing more than aggressively seeking to report on the government's actions,\" said Arthur Sulzberger Jr, the paper's publisher. </p> <p>\"Such subpoenas make it less likely that sources will be willing to talk candidly with reporters and ultimately it is the public that suffers.\" </p> <p>Ms Miller is a Pulitzer prize winner but she has been criticised for her reporting on Iraq, which promoted the Bush administration's view that Saddam Hussein had an active nuclear weapons programme. </p> <p>In an email to a colleague in May 2003 she said her reporting had relied heavily on the former Pentagon protege Ahmad Chalabi, who fell out of favour amid reports that he was passing on US secrets to Iran. </p> <p>A year later the New York Times published a note to readers that said its reporting in the run-up to the war was less than rigorous. </p> <p>Ms Miller had worked on three of the five stories the paper singled out for criticism.</p>",
  "<p>A freelance journalist kidnapped in the southern Iraqi city of Basra was freed yesterday after the rebel Shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, demanded his release. </p> <p>James Brandon, 23, who was on assignment for the Sunday Telegraph and the Scotsman, was snatched from his hotel room by more than 30 heavily armed militia who threatened to kill him if US forces did not leave the holy city of Najaf within 24 hours. </p> <p>But within hours of Mr Sadr calling for his release Brandon was taken to the clerics' local offices in Basra, where he held an impromptu news conference. </p> <p>He thanked the kidnappers and Mr Sadr's aides for working for his release, before being handed over to the British consulate by Brigadier Mohammed Kadhem al-Ali, the head of Basra police. </p> <p>\"I'm OK, I'm recovering,\" he said. \"I've been released thanks to the Mahdi army, because they intervened and negotiated with the kidnappers.\" </p> <p>He added: \"They just told me they realised I was a journalist and they said I was going to be let go. I didn't quite believe it until it actually happened.\" </p> <p>Several hours earlier a video made by his captors showed Brandon standing bare-chested and dazed with a large white bandage wrapped around his head. </p> <p>A man masked by a balaclava was seen standing next to him, making death threats: \"We are the sons of the Iraqi people. We demand the American forces withdraw from Najaf within 24 hours or we will kill this British hostage,\" he said, patting Brandon on the shoulder. </p> <p>The ashen-faced hostage then nervously turned to the camera: \"I'm a journalist, I just write about what is happening in Iraq ... [I'm] James Brandon from the Sunday Telegraph.\" </p> <p>Brandon was snatched from the Diafa hotel, a medium-sized city establishment, located not far from Basra's Shatt al Arab corniche, in a bustling commercial area that is home to a number of restaurants and hotels. </p> <p>\"When Brandon checked in on Wednesday we told him that the security situation was not good,\" said a receptionist at the hotel, Abu Mohammed. </p> <p>\"You are the only journalist here, so take care, we said. He replied: 'What am I supposed to do, I'm a journalist? I'm going to stay for a couple of nights and then leave'. </p> <p>\"On Thursday at 11pm a police car and a minibus pulled up close to the hotel and then deployed in the street. </p> <p>\"There were 30 men, five of them dressed as police. When they entered the hotel they took the magazine out of the Kalashnikov of the guard.\" </p> <p>The men then approached the reception desk. \"The receptionist said 'Yes can I help you?' But they hit him on the back just above the kidney with the butt of the Kalashnikov that was behind the desk. </p> <p>They said, 'You have a British journalist staying in your hotel'. I don't know where they got the information. </p> <p>\"Then they went upstairs and broke open the door of room 112 and they took him by force.\" </p> <p>Brandon, sporting a black eye and swelling around his face, said he heard a knock on his hotel room door and when he opened it eight men with guns, their faces covered by balaclavas, burst in and dragged him off. </p> <p>The kidnappers beat him, threatened to kill him and even carried out a fake execution with an unloaded gun, Brandon said. \"All sorts of unpleasant things happened.\" </p> <p>Television pictures taken at the hotel later showed a trail of blood leading from Brandon's hotel room on to the stairs. </p> <p>Brandon had spent more than a year working in Iraq, after arriving in July 2003 to work for the Baghdad Bulletin, a bi-monthly newspaper set up by young western university graduates. </p> <p>It was former colleagues at the Bulletin who helped negotiate Brandon's release yesterday. Dave Enders, who was the paper's editor, contacted representatives of Mr Sadr and arranged for the cleric to demand he be freed. </p> <p>Educated at Westminster school, Brandon, who is a quarter Egyptian, went to York University before enrolling at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, where he was learning Arabic. </p> <p>A former colleague on the paper said yesterday: \"He was not really keen on being a journalist, I think he just got addicted to the curiosity of the thing.\" </p> <p>When the Baghdad Bulletin closed Brandon got a job as a sub-editor on Iraq Today, another English language newspaper in Baghdad, before working as a freelance for several newspapers, including the Independent, Sunday Telegraph and the Scotsman. </p> <p>Matthew D'Ancona, deputy editor of the Sunday Telegraph, said Brandon had been in Basra filing material for this week's edition of the paper among other projects.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Author:</strong> Klaus Mann (1906-1949) was part of a German literary dynasty headed by his novelist father Thomas (Death in Venice, The Magic Mountain). Brother Heinrich wrote Professor Unrat (on which The Blue Angel was based) and sister Erika created the anti-Nazi cabaret The Peppermill. After Hitler's triumph in the 1933 elections, the entire Mann family left the country. Klaus moved to Amsterdam, where he wrote Mephisto in 1936. A year later, he relocated to the US, where he began his autobiography, The Turning Point . </p> <p>After its completion in 1942, he joined the US army, seeing service in the Psychological Warfare branch of military intelligence. As the cold war developed, however, he became increasingly depressed about the future. In 1949, in an essay entitled Europe's Search for a New Credo, he called for a \"movement of despair\", suggesting that a \"suicide wave\" of intellectuals would shock the world out of its \"lethargy\". A month before it appeared, Mann had already taken his own life, while in the south of France, with an overdose of sleeping pills. </p> <p><strong>Story:</strong> Mephisto is the story of German actor Hendrik H\u00f6fgen, a successful leftwing radical in the Weimar days, who does an apparent volte-face when the Nazis take power. After securing G\u00f6ring's patronage, H\u00f6fgen becomes a leading member of the Nazi cultural establishment. </p> <p>Mann clearly based H\u00f6fgen on his brother-in-law Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens, who failed to emigrate with the rest of the family, and became director of the Berlin State Theatre in 1934. Mann later wrote that Mephisto was not aimed at any individual, but \"against the German intellectual who sold and betrayed the German mind and spirit\"; however, after Gr\u00fcndgens's death in 1966, his descendants succeeded in having its West German edition banned until 1981. Gr\u00fcndgens's own performance as Mephistopheles survives in a postwar film of Faust (1960). </p> <p><strong>Film-makers:</strong> Istvan Szabo (b1938) grew up in Budapest under Nazi occupation, then communism. He started making films in Hungary in the early 1960s, before making an international impact with Father (1966). Mephisto, made only a few years after the novel's English language translation, won Szabo the best foreign language film Oscar. Szabo cast Viennese stage actor Klaus Maria Brandauer as H\u00f6fgen, a role that brought him global stardom almost overnight. </p> <p><strong>How book and film compare:</strong> Mann's novel is about a Faustian pact between intellectualism and totalitarianism, and Szabo makes it function as much as an allegory of communist repression as Nazi. His adaptation concentrates on the second half of the novel, as H\u00f6fgen negotiates his way through the Nazi regime. His H\u00f6fgen is more sympathetic than Mann's original creation, portrayed more at the mercy of events than the novel's underhand conniver. Szabo also builds up the character of the black prostitute Princess Tebab - she's no longer the leather-booted dominatrix of the novel, but a far more likeable figure. </p> <p><strong>Inspirations and influences:</strong> Mephisto marked a new humanism in German-language cinema after the German new wave of the 1970s. Szabo, a Hungarian, could grapple with the Nazi legacy in a less doctrinaire way. Szabo went on to shoot two more films, both starring Brandauer, in Germany examining German militarism and Nazism: Colonel Redl (1985) and Hanussen (1988).</p>",
  "Two of the government-favoured academy schools have paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds to organisations owned by their sponsors, it emerged yesterday. <p>The King's Academy in Middlesbrough has been billed by organisations and individuals connected with its founder, the car dealer Sir Peter Vardy, to the tune of \u00a3290,214, an investigation by the Times Educational Supplement revealed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the West London Academy in Ealing paid \u00a3180,964 to businesses and a charity connected to its sponsor Alec Reed, chairman of Reed Executive. </p> <p>The payments were for marketing, recruitment, training and \"educational advice\". </p> <p>Academies are central to the government's five-year plan to improve secondary schools, but have been criticised by teachers' unions for allowing private organisations too much influence over teaching. </p> <p>The government plans to introduce 200 new academies by the end of the decade to replace failing schools. Private sponsors are asked to donate \u00a32m, which is met by a \u00a322m cash injection from the government. The school's running costs are covered by the public, while private sponsors control the school's governing body and have the power to employ staff and set the curriculum. </p> <p>According to the Times Educational Supplement, West London Academy paid \u00a3140,030 to Reed Charity, chaired by Mr Reed; \u00a337,683 to Reed Learning; and \u00a33,251 to Reed Training, firms of which he was also a director. </p> <p>Payments by the King's Academy, which is sponsored by Sir Peter's Emmanuel Schools Foundation, include \u00a3111,554 for \"support services such as marketing and recruitment\" to his car dealer firm, Reg Vardy plc; \u00a3121,514 for \"educational advice\" from Emmanuel College; and a \u00a343,107 consultancy fee to the college's former principal John Burn. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Emmanuel Schools Foundation said it did not follow the usual protocol for schools, which dictates that they should put contracts out for tender and seek three quotes before contracting a company. </p> <p>\"We have a lot of experience in this and we test the market regularly. We haven't found better prices,\" she said. </p> <p>Steve Sinnott, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It doesn't matter how much money an organisation is putting in, it has to obey the rules and it has to ensure that that money is there. If the government is to ensure that these schools operate to the benefit of pupils then their methods must be open and transparent and conform to best practice.\" </p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills said: \"It is easy to criticise radical steps to break the cycle of educational underachievement. We prefer to get on with giving children in these areas the very best education that we can.\"</p>"
