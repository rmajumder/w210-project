  "<p>Liverpool and England have received the news they had been dreading, with confirmation that Steven Gerrard has broken his foot and could be sidelined until Christmas. </p> <p>The 23-year-old injured his left foot when he jarred it into the ground. He limped out of Monday's 2-1 Premiership defeat at Manchester United, with x-rays undertaken yesterday revealing he has broken the fifth metatarsal. Liverpool have ruled him out for eight weeks though, given recent cases, that may prove optimistic. </p> <p>Gerrard will miss next month's World Cup qualifiers against Wales and Azerbaijan after becoming the fifth England player to succumb to a metatarsal fracture in the last two years. David Beckham, Danny Murphy, Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney have all spent lengthy periods in rehabilitation after breaking the bone, with the latter two ruled out for considerably longer than two months. </p> <p>Neville was out of action for almost five months, missing the 2002 World Cup finals in the process, after sustaining his injury in the semi-final of the Champions League against Bayer Leverkusen in April 2002. It has already been three months since Rooney succumbed to an injury, identical to that suffered by Gerrard, against Portugal during the quarter-final of Euro 2004. </p> <p>Rooney is due to have a scan today to check on the progress of the injury and is expected to return to action for Manchester United against Middlesbrough on October 3. </p> <p>The fifth metatarsal is renowned for healing slower than the other four largely due to the poor blood supply by which it is served. That is likely to see Gerrard sidelined for nearer three months at best, taking him up to the end of December before he can return to action. </p> <p>His absence will come as a major setback for Sven-Goran Eriksson with qualification for World Cup 2006 in mind, though the Swede does at least have alternatives in central midfield. \"It's bad news for Liverpool, for him and for us,\" Eriksson said. </p> <p>Owen Hargreaves and Nicky Butt will come into contention for October's qualifiers, while there remains the option of reverting Beckham to a central role and including Shaun Wright-Phillips on the right wing. </p> <p>Yet, for Liverpool, the injury could prove disastrous. Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side must expect to be without their captain for the rest of their Champions League group campaign - they face Olympiakos, Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a and Monaco - not to mention up to 12 Premiership games. The development of the pairing of Xabi Alonso and Gerrard in the centre has been checked at an early stage, with Dietmar Hamann the likeliest alternative option available. </p> <p>\"We have Hamann and Alonso, who both played well at Old Trafford,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"I also hope Igor Biscan and Salif Diao can do well. This is a big blow but we have a good squad with players to come in.\" Yet the Spaniard will be without the drive and attacking verve provided by Gerrard through the middle. </p> <p>Yet the captain's very future at Anfield hinges on a successful first season under Ben\u00edtez to deflect expected interest from Chelsea and the continent next summer. Without Gerrard in their ranks Liverpool will be hard pressed to break into the Premiership's top three, casting further doubt over the midfielder's long-term future at the club. Without him last season the club would have struggled to have finished fourth to secure a return to Europe's elite. </p> <p>\"I will try to remain positive,\" said Gerrard. \"Xabi Alonso played the ball to me and I caught my foot in the turf. It's devastating to be out for so long.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Eriksson indicated that Rio Ferdinand would make an immediate England return after making his first appearance for Manchester United since completing an eight-month ban. </p> <p>Although the Swede was not at Old Trafford, he said: \"I heard [Ferdinand] played well. He will be picked if he is fit, of course he will.\" </p> <p>Eriksson last night played down suggestions that he would be interested in the vacant manager's post at Real Madrid. The England coach, under contract until the 2008 European Championships, said: \"I haven't spoken to anyone from that club. I have a contract and that's it. It is not an issue to decide.\"</p>",
  "<p>Alex McLeish will take his Rangers team to his former club Aberdeen tonight with the nation speculating when, not if, he will be sacked. It was at Pittodrie that McLeish made his name as an outstanding defender under Alex Ferguson. He went on to make 77 appearances for Scotland. But in the current circumstances to be going back to the place he once called home will afford him no comfort at all. </p> <p>The rejuvenated north-east club, under Jimmy Calderwood's impressive new management, drew with Rangers on the opening day and have since gone on the kind of run that suggests they could inflict further damage. </p> <p>Given a choice of venues for this CIS Insurance Cup tie, the Rangers manager would not have picked Pittodrie, though he would never admit it. Instead he said: \"This is Rangers. It would be a bad day if we were afraid of going to Aberdeen.\" </p> <p>They may not be afraid but anxious certainly and his concerns have mounted with the news that Dragan Mladenovic, Maurice Ross and Dado Prso, all injured in the narrow weekend win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle, will miss the trip north. </p> <p>Following this tie he takes his under-achieving team to Dundee at the weekend and then, the following Thursday, faces the return Uefa Cup match against the Portuguese minnows Maritimo, who have already embarrassed the club by winning the first leg 1-0. In this light a week tomorrow seems the day of destiny for McLeish. Conventional wisdom suggests he must win all three fixtures even to survive in the short term. </p> <p>It really has gone horribly wrong for Rangers since their treble 16 months ago when the manager could do no wrong. Now, it seems, he can do little right. </p> <p>He was forgiven a barren season last year because the fans understood the financial restraints he was operating under following the free-spending Dick Advocaat era. But this season, after the signing of Jean-Alain Boumsong, Marvin Andrews, Alex Rae, Mladenovic, Gr\u00e9gory Vignal, Nacho Novo and Prso, patience has already worn thin. </p> <p>Failure to come through Champions League qualifying, thanks to CSKA Moscow, and an August defeat at Celtic Park have taken McLeish to the brink, so that even victories in these three forthcoming matches may offer him only a temporary reprieve because his problems appear to be gathering a momentum of their own. </p> <p>The injury to Mladenovic follows long-term problems for the two Raes, Gavin and Alex, to leave Stephen Hughes as the only recognised midfield man. </p> <p>But McLeish, putting on a brave face, said: \"The group of players I have will come good, I am positive of that. I know the expectations at this club and they are always there. There is no gloom and doom here. I have to focus and not listen to any of the negativity. We have the heart and character to pull through this.\" </p> <p>The manager's problems are compounded by the state of the club off the pitch. David Murray, under whose stewardship Rangers made massive strides forward but at considerable cost, has recently returned as chairman after a spell when he took a back seat - publicly at least - as John McClelland tried to reduce the debt that then stood at \u00a368m. </p> <p>Murray's return coincides with the announcement that a further \u00a36m was lost last year taking the club to \u00a374m in the red. </p> <p>Murray has, however, promised a rights issue that will raise \u00a357m and his own company, Murray International Holdings Limited, has underwritten that to the tune of \u00a350m. It is all part of a general - albeit belated - understanding that they cannot spend, spend, spend the way they used to in an attempt to join the big boys of Europe. </p> <p>\"I have to take my share of the blame for the debt and we need to get the club on a level playing field,\" admitted Murray last night. </p> <p>\"But as well as doing the rights issue we have to start winning some football matches. We have missed out on the Champions League but, if we can get through to the Uefa Cup group stages, it can raise significant income. We need that to happen. If it didn't, it would be very, very disappointing.\" </p> <p>Read what you will into that last statement but its underlying points will certainly not have been lost on McLeish. </p> <p>All this is happening to a background of Celtic maintaining domestic supremacy and of Martin O'Neill's team being involved in a glamorous Champions League group that includes Barcelona and Milan. </p> <p>Some people will fail to see the connection and will argue that Celtic should not come into the equation. But in Glasgow comparisons between the two Old Firm clubs are inevitable. </p> <p>And this does not hold only in the west of Scotland. Rangers and Celtic have fans worldwide and, wherever one goes, their current fortunes are discussed and dissected. </p> <p>The Ibrox and Parkhead clubs were even the subject of much debate at last weekend's Ryder Cup where one or two of the Scots' Celtic-supporting caddies enjoyed winding up the hero of the hour Colin Montgomerie, a Leeds United fan who leans towards Rangers when it comes to Scotland. </p> <p>Right now, though, half of the Old Firm seems in terminal decline and there are fans of Rangers who feel the heart has gone out of the club. </p> <p>After the heart the next to go could be McLeish.</p>",
  "'Wars, conflict - it's all business,\" sighs Monsieur Verdoux in Charlie Chaplin's 1947 film of the same name. Many will not need to be convinced of the link between US corporations now busily helping themselves to Iraqi state assets and the military machine that prised Iraq open for global business. But what is less widely known is that a similar process is already well under way in a part of the world where B52s were not so long ago dropping bombs in another \"liberation\" mission. <p>The trigger for the US-led bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 was, according to the standard western version of history, the failure of the Serbian delegation to sign up to the Rambouillet peace agreement. But that holds little more water than the tale that has Iraq responsible for last year's invasion by not cooperating with weapons inspectors. </p> <p>The secret annexe B of the Rambouillet accord - which provided for the military occupation of the whole of Yugoslavia - was, as the Foreign Office minister Lord Gilbert later conceded to the defence select committee, deliberately inserted to provoke rejection by Belgrade. </p> <p>But equally revealing about the west's wider motives is chapter four, which dealt exclusively with the Kosovan economy. Article I (1) called for a \"free-market economy\", and article II (1) for privatisation of all government-owned assets. At the time, the rump Yugoslavia - then not a member of the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO or European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - was the last economy in central-southern Europe to be uncolonised by western capital. \"Socially owned enterprises\", the form of worker self-management pioneered under Tito, still predominated. </p> <p>Yugoslavia had publicly owned petroleum, mining, car and tobacco industries, and 75% of industry was state or socially owned. In 1997, a privatisation law had stipulated that in sell-offs, at least 60% of shares had to be allocated to a company's workers. </p> <p>The high priests of neo-liberalism were not happy. At the Davos summit early in 1999, Tony Blair berated Belgrade, not for its handling of Kosovo, but for its failure to embark on a programme of \"economic reform\" - new-world-order speak for selling state assets and running the economy in the interests of multinationals. </p> <p>In the 1999 Nato bombing campaign, it was state-owned companies - rather than military sites - that were specifically targeted by the world's richest nations. Nato only destroyed 14 tanks, but 372 industrial facilities were hit - including the Zastava car plant at Kragujevac, leaving hundreds of thousands jobless. Not one foreign or privately owned factory was bombed. </p> <p>After the removal of Slobodan Milosevic, the west got the \"fast-track\" reforming government in Belgrade it had long desired. One of the first steps of the new administration was to repeal the 1997 privatisation law and allow 70% of a company to be sold to foreign investors - with just 15% reserved for workers. The government then signed up to the World Bank's programmes - effectively ending the country's financial independence. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as the New York Times had crowed, \"a war's glittering prize\" awaited the conquerors. Kosovo has the second largest coal reserves in Europe, and enormous deposits of lignite, lead, zinc, gold, silver and petroleum. </p> <p>The jewel is the enormous Trepca mine complex, whose 1997 value was estimated at $5bn. In an extraordinary smash and grab raid soon after the war, the complex was seized from its workers and managers by more than 2,900 Nato troops, who used teargas and rubber bullets. </p> <p>Five years on from the Nato attack, the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), the body that operates under the jurisdiction of the UN Mission in Kosovo (Unmik) - is \"pleased to announce\" the programme to privatise the first 500 or so socially owned enterprises (SOEs) under its control. The closing date for bids passed last week: 10 businesses went under the hammer, including printing houses, a shopping mall, an agrobusiness and a soft-drinks factory. The Ferronikeli mining and metal-processing complex, with an annual capacity of 12,000 tonnes of nickel production, is being sold separately, with bids due by November 17. </p> <p>To make the SOEs more attractive to foreign investors, Unmik has altered the way land is owned in Kosovo, allowing the KTA to sell 99-year leases with the businesses, which can be transferred or used as loans or security. Even Belgrade's pro-western gov ernment has called this a \"robbery of state-owned land\". For western companies waiting to swoop, there will be rich pickings indeed in what the KTA assures us is a \"very investor-friendly\" environment. But there is little talk of the rights of the moral owners of the enterprises - the workers, managers and citizens of the former Yugoslavia, whose property was effectively seized in the name of the \"international community\" and \"economic reform\". </p> <p>As the corporate takeover of the ruins of Baghdad and Pristina proceeds apace, neither the \"liberation\" of Iraq nor the \"humanitarian\" bombing of Yugoslavia has proved Chaplin's cynical anti-hero to be wrong. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Neil Clark is a writer and broadcaster specialising in Balkan affairs </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ngc66798@hotmail.com\">ngc66798@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "Once, not so long ago, Britain was a country where families gathered around the table at meal times to eat and talk to each other. <p>But families are now abandoning their dining tables and becoming more like the fictional and lazy Royle Family who eat their meals supine on their sofa with the TV droning on in the background. </p> <p>A survey of parents found that 20% of British families said they sat down to eat together once a week or less frequently. Children often had meals in their bedrooms while watching TV or playing computer games. </p> <p>The survey of 2,170 parents on the raisingkids.co.uk website reveals a huge social change in the past two generations. In the 50s and 60s the great majority of families sat down together at least five or six times a week for a meal. </p> <p>The website said the increasing demands on parents and children's time and the proliferation of TV channels and ready meals, were contributing to the change. Only a third of parents - 34.4% - said they ate with their children every day; 45% said they did most days. </p> <p>The advent of central heating has also played its part in the decline in family eating. In the middle of the last century the kitchen was often one of the warmest rooms in the house. In winter, children were inhibited from retreating to their bedrooms by their coldness.</p> <p>Pat Spungin, the parenting expert who set up the website, said: \"The cement of all relationships is talk. </p> <p>\"If you are not sitting down at mealtimes and the rest of your day you have all got your own activities, then that is diluting the relationship. </p> <p>\"At home, children spend more time alone with their own TVs, computers and music systems and less time in family activities. Eating together is often the only opportunity for the family to talk, share experiences, laugh and have family time.\" </p> <p>Meals cooked for all the family were likely to be balanced and nutritious, rather than microwave reheated food. </p> <p>Several families in the survey said they had tried to get their children to sit with them but had given up, saying it was \"too difficult to organise\" or \"the kids won't co-operate\". </p> <p>A woman with five children said: \"I find the best way to all eat real food is for us to all sit down at the table together - which sort of disappeared for a while as everyone was doing stuff. </p> <p>\"We sit down now at least five nights a week and Sunday lunch, and it is the most gratifying feeling I get to see my family tucking in to food made by me and talking/laughing and just being together.\" </p> <p>People who were encouraged to sit down to a family meal when they were young were more likely to carry on the tradition with their own children. </p> <p>And the survey found that there was continuing support for the traditional Sunday lunch. About 30% of respondents said it was the one day of the week when they made a special effort to get the whole family together. </p> <p>The website is promoting the benefits of shared family meals with a \"Back to the table\" campaign. It will offer tips on how to encourage more quality time at the table, including setting realistic targets of three to four meals a week around the table, and switching off the television.</p>",
  "There is women's wrestling on the satellite TV, and Cairo's traffic police have turned out in force to watch. They slouch in the cafe, puffing on shishas, coughing, brushing away flies and drinking tea. <p>The tea comes in a glass with a thick sediment of leaves and sugar in the bottom. Slops spill over the brim and swill on a metal tray that rocks on a table that wobbles on the sawdust-covered floor. </p> <p>Cairo has a lot that wobbles or doesn't work quite as it should. In the fashionable Zamalek district even the streets can be hazardous. Pavements are an obstacle course of loose manhole covers, obtruding pipework, missing paving stones, assorted debris and the occasional cat. </p> <p>And one way or another, most of the country's social infrastructure resembles Zamalek's pavement obstacle course. </p> <p>Today the National Democratic party, which has monopolised Egyptian politics for decades, begins a three-day conference which it has heralded as a big step towards sorting out the mess. </p> <p>Reform has been a long time coming, and critics say it is only happening now because of US pressure. Committees have travelled the world to see what works elsewhere, and how reforms have been implemented. One of the ideas from Britain is an Egyptian version of Ofsted. </p> <p>\"We're not re-inventing the wheel,\" said Hossam Badrawi, who chairs the party's education committee. The reformers acknowledge, though, that their biggest problem is in changing attitudes, both among officials who treat red tape as a way to line their pockets and among traditional-minded citizens. </p> <p>There is widespread ignorance; Dr Badrawi has ambitious plans to help children with special needs, but some parents are aghast, believing that contact with other children will spread the \"infection\". </p> <p>There is also apathy. On the streets of Cairo yesterday Egyptians were reluctant to talk about reform. \"Sorry, I don't get into politics,\" said one young man. An unofficial tourist tout, who moments earlier had been offering a visit to a perfume shop, hurried away when asked. </p> <p>Arafat, a taxi driver relaxing with three friends in Tahrir Square, had no complaints. \"It's not perfect but it's OK,\" he said. \"Everything is better than 20 years ago.\" </p> <p><b>Paperwork</b></p> <p>In fact, laws and officialdom stand in the way of almost everything. For foreign investors the paperwork to set up a company in Egypt takes two months. In Jordan it takes a day, and in thriving Dubai 20 minutes.</p> <p>This year some advertising creatives thought it would be fun to sell bumper stickers saying: \"Cairo traffic rules. Green: stop. Red: go. Yellow: go faster.\" Four were arrested for \"defaming Egypt\" and kept in jail until a judge decided the charges were daft.</p> <p>Under a decree dating back to the time of Nasser it is illegal to compile statistics without government permission. This applies not only to opinion pollsters but to students doing fieldwork. </p> <p>The authorised statistics about President Hosni Mubarak are that he is 76 and has been in power for almost 23 years. His current (fourth) term in office ends next year and, despite two recent health scares - one in which he collapsed in front of the TV cameras - many expect him to seek another term in a referendum. There is also much speculation that the president's 41-year-old son, Gamal, is being groomed for power. Suave, go-ahead, and immersed in economics, he might even be a good choice were it not for his family name.</p> <p>When Gamal and reforms are packaged together, however, critics claim that the reforms are merely a way of promoting Gamal - and Egyptians seem hostile to the idea of a Syrian-style inherited presidency. </p> <p>The other, possibly decisive, factor in the presidential wrangling is the Egyptian army, which expects presidents to have a military background and is thought to favour the intelligence chief Omar Suleiman. </p> <p>While the NDP prefers to focus on economics and education, it is also considering limited political reforms, including tinkering with the rules on the formation of political parties. </p> <p>This month, though, eight of the officially recognised opposition parties got together to demand far-reaching constitutional changes that would allow a free and direct election of the country's next leader.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a non-authorised group, which includes such odd bedfellows as the Muslim Brotherhood, the Communists and human-rights activists, has formed the Popular Campaign for Change, under the slogans \"No to a new mandate\" and \"No to inheritance of the presidency\". </p> <p>Its first press conference was blocked by the authorities, but the campaigners are now trying to commission an opinion poll on what Egyptians think of another term for Mr Mubarak, and the question of hereditary succession. </p> <p>Since this involves compiling statistics, it requires government permission. The campaigners, anticipating a refusal, are preparing to go to court - something that they believe will also help to mobilise public opinion. </p> <p><b>Emergency</b> </p> <p>Ahmed Seif al-Islam, a lawyer and one of the group's organisers, believes President Mubarak is deeply unpopular and that people have become bolder in showing their feelings about him. He cites a demonstration against the Iraq war last year: \"The only property damaged was a picture of Hosni Mubarak outside the party building.\" </p> <p>Asked what would happen if Egyptians were given a free choice for their next president, he replied: \"They would choose someone from the Muslim Brotherhood. Not because they accept the brotherhood's programme, but because they hate the regime.\" </p> <p>Opposition calls to lift emergency laws, which have been in force since the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981, are also supported by some in the ruling NDP. </p> <p>Originally intended to deal with Islamist militants, the \"emergency\" has been an excuse for all sorts of other crackdowns over the years, including the rounding up of dozens of gay men at a disco in 2001, supposedly because they posed a threat to national security. </p> <p>So far, though, the NDP has resisting radical political change. The official line, as set out by the party's secretary-general, Safwat el-Sherif, is that too much talk of constitutional reform \"will open the door to foreign intervention in domestic affairs\". </p> <p>Even the ostensibly safer ground of economic and educational reform - the two subjects being tackled by the three-day reform conference - is not without political risks for President Mubarak. When the government cut subsidies on diesel fuel this month bus fares shot up by 50%, causing frayed tempers in the teeming streets of Cairo. That increase is probably only the first of many, and the price of diesel at the pump is still only a third of what it really costs. </p> <p>For Iman el-Kaffass, who chairs the Egyptian Association for Education and Development, the secret of successful reform is in how it is explained to the public. </p> <p>When the government wanted to base secondary school certificates on three years' assessment rather than final exams, many parents objected. </p> <p>\"To persuade them, you have to know what to mention,\" Ms Kaffass said. </p> <p>\"In the rural areas, for example, people are more religious, so you talk to them about how God decides to send people to heaven or hell. You tell them God's decision is not based on final-year exams, it's based on cumulative assessment. And they agree.\"</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> I returned to London from my short summer interlude elsewhere to find the legal world in turmoil. Cherie Booth QC has hired an agent to get her some lecturing gigs in the US; Sir John Mortimer QC turns out, long ago, to have had a love child with a non-lawyer, the actress Wendy Craig; Linda Dobbs QC became the first black high court judge; and the solicitors' profession has devised a billboard advertising campaign based on the slogan \"My Hero, My Solicitor\", which is - hard to believe but true - not meant to be ironic. <p>Each poster tells a little story of woe, misfortune and misery destined to end in tragedy - until a solicitor emerges to put things right. \"Me and my children were about to be evicted from our home when my solicitor stepped in. We still got evicted, but my solicitor agreed to wait a week before suing me for his fees. My Hero, My Solicitor.\" That sort of thing. </p> <p>Astonishingly, a public opinion survey revealed that 73% of interviewees found the ads \"believable\"; which means that they were prepared to see a solicitor in the same heroic light as Churchill and Superman. Or it's a tribute to the British public's sense of humour that they answer a silly question posed by a person with a clipboard with an equally ridiculous answer. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I see nothing wrong with Cherie Booth wanting to make a bit of money on the lecture circuit, nor with her keeping her earnings from her co-written book about goldfish. As I know, she gives a lot of time and effort to many charitable causes, willingly and for no reward. Why should she be expected to donate the proceeds of her writings to charity? True, she would not be in such demand as speaker or writer were she not the prime minister's wife. So? We don't ask other people to forgo making money for themselves just because their fame is linked to someone else's. </p> <p>What, though, I find bizarre is the figure of \u00a330,000 apparently being bandied about by her agent as her proposed fee per lecture. She wouldn't be able to express her innermost thoughts on her husband's handling of the Iraq issue, or indeed on any controversial aspect of his prime ministership. She wouldn't reveal family intimacies either. So what could her audience expect which is worth some society or other paying her \u00a330,000? Perhaps I'm being naive about American audiences; the fact that she's Mrs Tony Blair may be enough - no matter what she says. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The new high court judge Linda Dobbs joins that very small band of senior judges in possession of a genuine (as distinct from honorary) doctorate.

The parents want a public hearing; Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust and Cafcass (the Children and Family Courts Advisory and Support Service, which represents the child), are seeking reporting restrictions. They also want a media ban on identifying trust employees, including doctors and nurses, involved in the care of Charlotte - as well as the lawyers acting for the trust and Cafcass. </p> <p>There is already a temporary ban on naming their lawyers (though not those acting for the parents). The reason, I guess, is to prevent any individual or group with strong feelings about the issues from venting their anger, in whatever way, against the named lawyers.

  "The two-year-old partial ban on foxhunting in Scotland will be challenged again today, days after parliament voted to ban hunting in England and Wales. <p>At the court of session in Edinburgh a hunt supporter and member of the Union of Country Sports Workers, Brian Friend, will appeal against an earlier ruling that the legislation does not breach human rights. </p> <p>Mr Friend, of Membury, Devon, tried to have the Scottish ban overturned by the courts last year but was unsuccessful. </p> <p>He and a fellow union member, Jeremy Whaley, argued that it violated the 1998 Human Rights Act and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </p> <p>The judge at that hearing, Lord Brodie, upheld the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act. </p> <p>\"This action is in my name, but it's for everybody who hunts in the Borders,\" said Mr Friend, who has a cottage in Kelso in the Scottish Borders. </p> <p>\"I believe in civil liberty and I believe it is my right to go hunting. </p> <p>\"They think everyone who goes hunting is toffs, but I'm the son of a London taxi driver. </p> <p>\"It really does embrace dukes to dustmen and has been part of our culture since the Iron Age.\" </p> <p>Mr Friend said he had little hope that the appeal would succeed, but he would pursue the case all the way to the European court of human rights. </p> <p>Under the Scottish law foxes can still be hunted but must be shot once they are flushed out by dogs. </p> <p>Only one of Scotland's 10 mounted hunts has folded since the law was introduced, but the number of people taking part has fallen drastically. </p> <p>Hunt-related businesses say their earnings are down by between 25% and 50%.</p>",
  "In the United States, litigation follows life- style, and the famous \"palimony\" lawsuit pursued by Marvin Mitchelson, who has died aged 76, on behalf of Michelle Triola Marvin, proved a landmark of both the sexual revolution and women's liberation. The case still resonates, not least in British courts, as it began a steady legal redefinition of the concepts of divorce and alimony. <p>Michelle Triola, the partner of actor Lee Marvin, originally approached Mitchelson because she had lived in an apartment complex owned by his mother. But he was already a prominent divorce lawyer, having made his reputation representing Pamela Mason against her actor husband, James. By threatening to put their friends on the witness stand, and reveal details of their personal lives, he won Pamela Mason an out-of-court settlement of $1.5m, hailed, in 1964, as the first million-dollar divorce. </p> <p>The irony of the Triola case was that Mitchelson won the war, establishing the principle, but lost his client's battle. Triola had abandoned a career as a nightclub singer to live with Marvin. When they split after six years, in 1973, she hired Mitchelson to sue for half of Marvin's $3.6m income earned during their time together. The suit, filed on grounds of breach of contract, was rejected by the California court, and failed on appeal. </p> <p>But, in 1976, the California supreme court ruled that cohabiting unmarried partners had a right to a share in communal property, if they could demonstrate a written or oral contract, or if judges found the couples' behaviour implied such a contract. In a 1979 retrial, the judge ruled that no such contract existed between Marvin and Triola. He awarded Triola $104,000 for \"retraining\" in a new career, but even that was overturned on appeal. </p> <p>Triola had lost, but by that time Mitchelson was one of the best-known lawyers in the US. He attracted clients like Bianca Jagger, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Joan Collins, but specialised in non-celebrities, usually women, seeking a share of their more famous partner's assets. Among them were Sara Dylan, Barbie Benton (suing Hugh Hefner) and Anna Kashfi, whose papers against Marlon Brando he had served via helicopter. </p> <p>Mitchelson was born in Detroit to immigrant parents. His Polish father was a decorator; his mother came from Ukraine. The family moved to Los Angeles when he was 18 months old. After serving as a navy corpsman, he earned a BA from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1953, and got his law degree from Southwestern University three years later. </p> <p>He began practising in Beverly Hills at a time when Los Angeles was witnessing fierce competition between tabloid newspapers, and he became adept at feeding information about his cases to reporters. He also delighted in playing both ends against the middle, representing clients in libel suits against those same tabloids. </p> <p>Mitchelson claimed to be proudest of his 1963 victory in Douglas v California before the US supreme court, establishing the right of indigents to legal representation. However, after the Mason case the following year, his work concentrated more and more on divorce. </p> <p>He basked in the limelight and became known for his witty remarks; he defined palimony as a \"commitment with no rings attached\", and described the Marvin ruling as \"the biggest setback for show business since John Wilkes Booth\". </p> <p>But his high-profile lifestyle attracted trouble. In 1988, the California bar charged him with eight separate frauds against clients, his secretary testified he was addicted to cocaine and painkillers, the Internal Revenue Service sued him for back taxes and the auctioneers Sothebys claimed he had failed to pay $1m worth of jewellery bills. On television, two former clients branded him a rapist. </p> <p>In 1993, Mitchelson was convicted on four counts of tax fraud and suspended by the California bar. After a series of appeals, and treatment for skin cancer and heart disease, in 1996 he began a two-year sentence at Lompoc jail, where he ran the law library, advised prisoners on appeals and organised an opera society. </p> <p>Released in 1998, Mitchelson worked as a paralegal for two years until the California bar decided to readmit him. Last year, he won a $216m settlement in a divorce suit against the Saudi royal family. He was a frequent analyst on tabloid television shows, and published two books: Made In Heaven, Settled In Court (1979) and Living Together (1981). He is survived by Marcella, his wife of 45 years, and their son.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Marvin Morris Mitchelson, lawyer, born May 7 1928; died September 18 2004</p>",
  "Rarely am I genuinely moved by a newspaper column, but Martin Jacques's article about how adult culture has devolved into an adolescent one over the last 40 years has truly broken through (The death of intimacy, September 18). But where I disagree is that \"not much\" can be done by policy wonks. Clearly, the diffusion of electronic child-minding is a major culprit that must be attacked. Thus, all wealthy nations should impose crippling taxes (at a rate of several hundred percent) on TV and radio advertising, cable and satellite services, video games and of course all the hardware (TVs, DVDs, game players etc) associated with the disposable culture. <p>No doubt such solutions would be denounced as social engineering, and critics would have a point. But we have become so fearful of restricting the liberty to indulge the self that we are willing to pay - and make our children pay - any hideous price in the relentless quest to avoid self-denial. <br><b>Andrew Hirsch</b> <br>Coshocton, Ohio, USA </p> <p>Martin Jacques repeats the mantra of a growing movement (to which Tony Blair, Melanie Phillips and Jonathan Sacks all belong): society is going down the pan because individuals are no longer rooted in a \"settled community\". </p> <p>Such talk sounds very comfy and cosy, but be warned, what these critics often mean is this: things went wrong back in the 60s when those pesky \"liberals\" (Tony's new term of abuse) encouraged individuals to start thinking for themselves. Let's get back to faith communities and deference to authority! </p> <p>Are we any more shallow and self-serving now than we were 100 years ago? I rather doubt it. And even if we are, we can certainly reject a shallow and self-serving culture without signing up to this new authoritarian agenda. <br><b>Stephen Law</b> <br>Oxford </p> <p>Jacques's lacklustre conclusion - \"nothing much [can be done]\" other than at the individual consciousness level - will fall like manna on our quiescent politicians' ears. Doesn't he believe in the political struggle, in the efficacy of applied ideology, the potential for change via education, at all any longer? <br><b>Peter Dean</b> <br>Cambridge </p> <p>I'm no policy wonk, but the answer seems simple. All that is required to improve the quality of our daily lives is that we each need to invest more heavily in our relationships. Academic studies bear out what we know through experience - by shifting the focus of our lives subtly towards the minutiae of individual relationships, we can build stronger communities and simultaneously secure greater personal happiness. </p> <p>If we could relearn how to join with neighbours or colleagues in group activity we will be happier, healthier and enjoy a significantly improved quality of life. So let's begin the revolution by trying to get to know some of the people we see every day - and who knows where it may take us? <br><b>Radhika Bynon</b> <br>London </p> <p>Yet again women are blamed for society's woes, having been \"drawn into the labour market\" away from their children. No mention is made of the fact that while many working women battle with their employers for shorter working hours, men work the longest hours when their children are young. We advise hundreds of women seeking flexible working in order to spend more time at home, but not one man. </p> <p>Martin Jacques and the policy wonks should call to account the employers who demand long hours and men who fail to argue against them. <br><b>Camilla Palmer</b> <br><b>Joanna Wade</b> <br>London</p>",
  "Saeb Erekat called for the suspension of preferential trade relations between the EU and Israel, not all-out economic sanctions (Letters, September 20). The distinction is important. Israel has economic privileges not enjoyed by other, much poorer people, not even Palestinians wanting to export their olive oil to the UK. <p>Underwriting the agreement that gave Israel preferential status was \"respect for human rights and democratic principles\". By flouting international human rights law, Israel puts the agreement into jeopardy. The British government should now join others in the EU who seek to abide by the letter of the association agreement and secure its suspension, pending compliance. <br><b>Irene Bruegel</b> <br>Jews for Justice for Palestinians </p> <p>To oppose sanctions against Israel on the grounds that these did not work in Iraq or Cuba and \"would have no impact upon the Israeli government\" is to ignore their decisive effect upon a country much more similar to Israel - apartheid South Africa. </p> <p>Israel is, as the latter was, essentially a western colonialist state, both in its continuing attitude towards the people it has dispossessed and the need for its legitimacy to be accepted by the west, and crucially in its overriding need for the west to continue to bankroll it. </p> <p>Therefore, like South Africa before the sanctions brought down the apartheid regime (both in denying it funds, and in ostracising it culturally and in sport), sanctions are the only viable means available to force those running Israel to understand that the west is no longer prepared to underwrite what has essentially been an invasion and creeping occupancy of Palestine against the wishes of its inhabitants, to give thanks that the Palestinians are prepared to give up attempting to recover their land and accept Israel within its 1967 borders, and to withdraw immediately from those territories. </p> <p>UN resolution 242 of 1967, calling for the withdrawal from the occupied territories, has been ignored by Israel for over 35 years, with no action from the west except \"the gentle art of persuasion\" - precisely that which allowed apartheid to continue for over 45 years.

  "A message on an Islamist website claims that an al-Qaida related group has slaughtered a second American hostage in Iraq, an announcement that came as the group's 24-hour deadline for meeting its demands ran out. <p>\"The nation's zealous sons slaughtered the second American hostage ... after the end of the deadline ... We will provide you with film of the slaughter soon, God willing,\" said the statement, posted under the pseudonym Abu Maysara al-Iraqi. </p> <p>The authenticity of the claim could not be verified. However, al-Iraqi has posted past statements on behalf of Tawhid and Jihad, a militant group led by Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>A similar announcement posted by al-Iraqi preceded Monday's graphic video of the beheading of American engineer Eugene Armstrong, 52. Tawhid and Jihad - which abducted Armstrong, American Jack Hensley, 48, and Briton Kenneth Bigley, 62, on Thursday - has demanded all Muslim women in US custody in Iraq be freed. </p> <p>Tuesday's brief statement did not identify the latest victim by name. </p> <p>On Monday, the grisly footage of Armstrong's killing was posted about an hour after the initial statement claiming he was dead and promising video proof. On Tuesday, several hours passed with no video appearing. </p> <p>About two hours after the initial message was posted, a link appeared claiming to take viewers to the latest beheading video, but it was inaccessible. A few contributors complained in postings that the link wasn't working. It wasn't known whether it was a real link, and it later disappeared. </p> <p>Late Tuesday night, an expanded version of the statement saying a second American had been killed appeared on a separate website warning the British hostage would be the next to die. It did not contain any new deadline, and its authenticity was not known. </p> <p>Militants had said in the video of Armstrong's killing that they would kill within 24 hours one of the other two hostages unless their demand was met. Tuesday night's statement said the American had been killed. </p> <p>Hensley, who is married and has a 13-year-old daughter, Sara, is from the US state of Georgia. His wife Patty has made a television appeal in the United States asking that her husband be spared. </p> <p>\"My daughter would like her father back and I'm willing to do whatever it will take to get him here,\" Patty Hensley said on the ABC network's Good Morning America program. </p> <p>A Western diplomat in Baghdad, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities could not confirm the slaying because they had no corpse. </p> <p>Armstrong's body had been found on Monday in western Baghdad hours before the news of his beheading became public. </p> <p>The US Central Intelligence Agency determined with a \"high degree of confidence\" that al-Zarqawi was the masked militant who read out the lengthy statement before drawing a knife and beheading Armstrong. </p> <p>President George Bush condemned Armstrong's killing during a meeting in New York with interim Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. </p> <p>\"We all stand in solidarity with the (remaining) American that is now being held captive,\" Bush said in remarks less than two hours before the new claim surfaced. </p> <p>Bush, who was in New York to deliver a speech before the UN General Assembly, told a subdued UN session that terrorists believe that \"suicide and murder are justified ... and they act on their beliefs.\" </p> <p>The US military says the only two women in its custody in Iraq are two security prisoners: Dr. Rihab Rashid Taha, a scientist who became known as \"Dr Germ\" for helping Iraq make weapons out of anthrax, and Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, a biotech researcher known as \"Mrs Anthrax\". </p> <p>In London, the Bigley family appealed to prime minister Tony Blair to meet the captors' demands of releasing all women prisoners. </p> <p>\"I ask Tony Blair personally to consider the amount of bloodshed already suffered,\" Craig Bigley, 33, said in a videotaped statement.</p> <p>\"Please meet the demands and release my father - two women for two men ... only you can save him now.\" </p> <p>All three construction contractors worked for General Supplies and Commercial Services, based in the United Arab Emirates.

  "<p>The most memorable achievement of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho's four months at the Bernab\u00e9u was to keep Ronaldo's waistline in trim. Anyone who can get the self-indulgent Brazilian to knuckle down has to be saluted but the Real Madrid head coach resigned after deciding that he could not bring any such sense of proportion to the club itself. </p> <p>Real have been bloated for too long, puffed up by their own boastfulness and by the credulous way in which others have parroted their claims. Reality should have been good enough. Over the past few years there have been exciting and artful performances to be relished in Europe and beyond. </p> <p>This club, however, could not settle for that. They pretended that with commercial genius and a brash transfer market policy they had somehow broken new ground in football history. It is purely Real's self-presentation that has been miraculous. </p> <p>Whether putting himself or the team on display, Florentino P\u00e9rez has been a publicist of genius and he swept to re-election as president this summer despite a trophy-less season. It takes strong nerves to remember that it is actually Valencia, with two of the last three La Liga titles, who have dominated the Spanish scene. </p> <p>There has been too little scorn of Real's beautifully projected image as the club whose wealth brooks no resistance. The spectacle of the David Beckham signing a year ago was so absorbing that it almost went unnoticed that the deal was offset by the sale, release or loaning out of a dozen players. </p> <p>Sport, however, exposes the truth sooner or later. Real had been left with so hopelessly meagre a squad that an unprepared footballer could be humiliated. During a 4-1 pounding at Sevilla the young defender Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez had to be substituted after 26 minutes and was then seen sobbing on the bench. </p> <p>There would be more tears to be shed by others before the close of a season in which defeat in the Champions League quarter-final pointed the way to five consecutive losses at the close of the La Liga programme. Only when the club folds away its finely embroidered myths about itself can it start to recover. </p> <p>In simple sporting terms the situation is not irredeemable. Last week's 3-0 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, shaming as it was, merely marked the start of a Champions League group. Nor is it such a disgrace to go down 1-0 at Espanyol, as they did on Saturday, when Zin\u00e9dine Zidane and Luis Figo were joined on the injury list by Iker Casillas, who dislocated a finger in the warm-up. </p> <p>After falling to bruising defeats Real ought to realise, however, that it is time to give up the high-wire act. Virtuosity did hold them safe above all contenders for a while and it was epitomised by the contortionist's volley from Zidane that delivered the astounding winner over Leverkusen in the 2002 Champions League final. </p> <p>The Frenchman, however, is now old enough to have retired from international football and Figo is detaching himself from Portugal's cause. Ronaldo is younger but no one can be sure that he can still deliver the sort of hat-trick that inspired a standing ovation from a superbly sportsmanlike Old Trafford in 2003. </p> <p>The gal\u00e1cticos are waning and no new ones exist for P\u00e9rez to summon. There has been a rethink at the Bernab\u00e9u, with Emilio Butrague\u00f1o replacing Jorge Valdano as technical director, but it has a fair distance yet to go. Jonathan Woodgate and Walter Samuel, the two costly centre-halves, will not by themselves give adequate depth to the squad. </p> <p>Recognising the intractable egos on the playing staff and a shortage of challengers for their pegs in the dressing room, Camacho abandoned his post. Real have not seen silverware since Vicente Del Bosque, who had already supplied two Champions League honours, landed the La Liga trophy in 2003. The immediate sacking of that low-key figure snapped the last link with reality. </p> <p>Now Real have to re-establish contact with humility. The side, with Zidane at his peak, was a joy but it never deserved to be ranked with, say, the Milan of the early 1990s, who could complement Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten with native sons such as Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini to produce extraordinary all-round strength. </p> <p>When the current consternation fades, P\u00e9rez should change tack and dedicate himself to giving us a team that is cherished more than any of the great stars it might happen to contain.</p>",
  "<p>Southampton could be heading for their third managerial change in less than a year unless an appeal against Steve Wigley's lack of qualifications is successful. </p> <p>Wigley does not currently possess the Uefa Pro Licence required if he is to remain in charge of first-team affairs at the Premiership club. To obtain it Wigley must complete a 12-month course. But he would be unable to achieve this before the deadline for him to be licensed expires in December. </p> <p>Southampton have launched an appeal hoping to overturn the ruling. But the club would have to persuade their Premiership rivals to annul the regulations. This seems unlikely, forcing Rupert Lowe to appoint the eighth manager of his eight-year tenure as Southampton's chairman. </p> <p>\"Rupert Lowe is a Premier League chairman so he must have signed up to the regulation only a matter of months ago,\" said the League Managers' Association chairman John Barnwell. </p> <p>\"We all know the rules and, after all, the whole point of the licence is to produce better qualified managers, which will benefit everybody.\" </p> <p>Wigley seems resigned to the probability that he will have to relinquish first-team control even if results do not finish him first. His side fell to a 2-1 defeat to Newcastle on Sunday that left Southampton on four points, level with 19th-place West Bromwich Albion. </p> <p>\"They're saying you must have the Pro Licence to manage in the Premier League,\" said Wigley. \"I'm actually on the course now. I've been accepted on the course. It will take 12 months to complete and I'll do the residential [component] at the end of July. </p> <p>\"There are some rules that are in place but I'm not really up to speed on them.

  "President George Bush today used his speech to the United Nations general assembly to defend the US-led mission in Iraq as having \"enforced the demands of the world\". <p>Mr Bush was speaking five days after the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, described the decision to go to war in Iraq without the security council's approval as \"illegal\".</p> <p>In a strongly-worded speech that could be seen as a direct response to Mr Annan's comments - and perhaps as an implicit critique of the UN's reluctance to support military action - Mr Bush said there was a need to \"fight radicalism and terror with justice and dignity\".</p> <p>He said the US-led coalition had helped rid Iraq of a \"criminal dictator\" who flouted UN resolutions for more than a decade. Despite the hopes of peaceful nations, he said, \"eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others\".</p> <p>The president, in an address that also sought to highlight his security credentials ahead of November's national elections, said terrorists believe that \"suicide and murder are justified ... and they act on their beliefs\".</p> <p>Citing recent atrocities, such as the death of dozens of children held hostage in a school in Beslan, southern Russia, Mr Bush said \"civilised nations are in this struggle together, and all must fight the murderers\".</p> <p>In the face of criticism from his Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry, who said Mr Bush's policies had made the world a more dangerous place, he said that \"a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against [the terrorists'] ambitions in that region\".</p> <p>Ahead of Mr Bush's speech, Mr Annan opened the meeting of the 191-nation gathering with a warning that \"the rule of law\" is at risk around the world. </p> <p>\"No one is above the law. Again and again, we see fundamental laws shamelessly disregarded - those that ordain respect for innocent life, for civilians, for the vulnerable - especially children,\" he said. </p> <p>He condemned the taking and killing of hostages in Iraq, but also reminded delegates that Iraqi prisoners had been \"disgracefully abused\", an implicit criticism of the treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. </p> <p>Mr Bush made no reference to the prisoner abuse scandal, but he called on the UN to help with the reconstruction of Iraq, a mission that has been severely hampered by a growing insurgency and the deaths of more than 1,000 US troops.</p> <p>\"The people of Iraq have regained sovereignty,\" he said, noting that the prime minister of Iraq's interim government, Ayad Allawi, was among those attending the session. </p> <p>\"The UN and its member nations must respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request and do more to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal and free.</p> <p>As elections approach in both Afghanistan and Iraq, \"we can expect terror attacks to escalate\", Mr Bush said. But \"the proper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is to prevail\".</p> <p>In comments that could have significant implications for the stalled Middle East process, President Bush also called on Israel to impose a freeze on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza and to dismantle \"unauthorised outposts\". </p> <p>He issued a direct challenge to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, saying: \"Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorised outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations.\"</p> <p>He added that world leaders should \"withdraw all favour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause\".</p> <p>Mr Bush's speech, lasting just under 20 minutes, included an appeal for more humanitarian involvement, ranging from helping to end the bloody conflict in Sudan to fighting Aids in Africa. His remarks drew applause only once - at the end of his speech.</p> <p>He also told the gathering that he would support a resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning, and said he would be proposing a \"democracy fund\" to help countries develop \"the rule of law and independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions\".</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrat conference today unanimously backed the party's 10-point pre-manifesto, which promises to put more police on the beat, scrap university tuition fees and axe the council tax. <p>Its author, Matthew Taylor, was applauded when he urged delegates to return to their constituencies and \"give it life\" by posting it through every letterbox.</p> <p>There are no \"no-go\" areas for the Liberal Democrats, he insisted, as \"Liberal Democrat natural territory [now] means the British people\".</p> <p>As well as the party's commitments on police, fees and council tax, the pre-manifesto promises a billion pounds more investment in schools; \u00a325 more a week for pensioners over 75; and free personal care for the elderly.</p> <p>But despite their enthusiasm for the document, party activists used the opportunity of the manifesto debate to make a stand against the perceived rightward drift of the party's leadership</p> <p>This took the form of an amendment, also unanimously passed, rejecting the party's Treasury spokesman, David Laws' proposals to replace the NHS with a compulsory insurance scheme. </p> <p>Mr Laws' plans were contained - alongside essays by the Lib Dems' other \"young Turks\" - in the controversial Orange Book, which has become the talking point of the conference.</p> <p>Moving the amendment restating the party's commitment to the NHS, Donnachadh McCarthy told delegates: \"We don't need to follow New Labour to the right. </p> <p>\"We don't need three right-wing parties in Britain. We remain at the progressive centre left.\" </p> <p>The Lib Dems' former health spokesman, Evan Harris, also condemned the Orange Book, calling it a \"distraction\" from the party's real efforts.</p> <p>And he went onto question why the party's commitment to abolishing dental and eye check-up charges were not in the pre-manifesto.</p> <p>Sir David Williams, the former leader of Richmond council, called on Mr Laws and others to \"stay on message\" and display \"discipline in the pre-election stage\".</p> <p>Speaking on behalf of the Lib Dems' policy committee, Alex Wilcock also implicitly attacked Mr Laws' plans, joking that his book had been marketed as orange but sold as a lemon.</p> <p>He promised that the party's commitments of eye and teeth testing would also be in the manifesto, saying that the leadership were still \"listening\" to what the members wanted to be in it.</p> <p>Following the manifesto debate, delegates gave their backing for the party's new demand for a \"phased withdrawal\" of British troops from Iraq following January's planned elections.</p> <p>A motion on Iraq, proposed after an impassioned speech from the party's defence spokesman Paul Keetch, was voted through unopposed - although several delegates added pleas for a reference to the continuing plight of the Palestinians to be added.</p> <p>Dr James Walsh, a councillor from Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, whose parents were born in Baghdad, said: \"I have lived in the Middle East, and Muslims do not trust America. There can be no peace in Iraq until Palestine is at peace, and the refugees are given their dignity back.</p> <p>\"These issues are inseparable.\"</p> <p>Another councillor, Linda Weerasirie of Bedford, backed the sacked frontbencher Jenny Tongue's call for Tony Blair to be impeached over Iraq. She is so far the only Lib Dem MP to have backed the cross-party campaign.</p> <p>But after an hour's debate, the party's seven-point demand - which also calls for the removal of immunity for foreign contractors, a veto for the interim government over US military operations and an investigation into missing Iraqi oil revenues - was passed unopposed.</p>",
  "<p>Nationally, the Liberal Democrats have consistently tried to present a nice wholesome face. Locally they are renowned street fighters, opportunistically exploiting every and any grievance to win, and seeking desperately to be all things to all people. But now the Lib Dems are going opportunistic nationally, too. </p> <p>Last week, Charles Kennedy published 10 reasons to vote Liberal Democrat. Much of it was calculated to reassure those left-of-centre voters who have gravitated to the \"nice party\" - a mixed bag of vague, uncosted promises on the NHS, early years education and the abolition of university tuition fees. </p> <p>But the central electoral dilemma for the Liberal Democrats is that although their appeal has traditionally been a progressive one, overwhelmingly their target seats are held by the Conservatives. Any hope of advance therefore depends on winning over disillusioned Tories. </p> <p>The party has therefore adopted a magpie approach. Progressive measures are bundled ill-fittingly with rightwing measures that neglect the interests of hard-working people. A good example of Lib Dem policy contortions was carried on these pages on Saturday, when the shadow home secretary Mark Oaten argued against ID cards on grounds of cost rather than civil liberties - respecting a sacred cow of his liberal wing, while defending it in the language of the right. </p> <p>To charm wavering Tories, the Lib Dems have grabbed a nestful of shiny rightwing policies. They would scrap the New Deal, which has helped more than one million people back into work, thus condemning thousands of young people to long-term unemployment. They opposed the increase in the minimum wage to \u00a34.85 an hour, preferring to trap people in poverty pay. They ape the Tories by promising \u00a325bn in spending cuts, threatening vital services on which those on low incomes most rely. They aim to save \u00a38bn by abolishing the Department of Trade and Industry, endangering everything from the enforcement of employee protection to the sick miners compensation scheme and economic assistance to our poorest regions. They would replace council tax with a local income tax, which would cost \u00a3450 a year more for an average working couple. They want to reintroduce the NHS internal market - a sequel to Tory mismanagement of our hospitals. And they plan a new wave of privatisations, including the Royal Mint. </p> <p>And be clear: their pitch to the right won't stop there. Earlier this month, Mr Kennedy wrote the foreword for the Orange Book, a collection of essays by his party's \"middle-aged Turks\", many of whom hold key positions on the party's front bench. </p> <p>In one essay, David Laws, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, proposes replacing the NHS with an insurance-based funding system. His proposals were copied directly from the Thatcherite thinktank Politeia and were praised by Doctors for Reform, a Tory front organisation which campaigns for the NHS to be dismantled. </p> <p>In another, Susan Kramer, lined up to be the next MP for Richmond Park, calls for a free-market approach to the environment - progressive cause, rightwing approach. And the Lib Dem shadow chancellor, Vincent Cable, calls for a new wave of economic deregulation, and argues for voucher schemes in public services - for example, in further education and care for the disabled. Vouchers are of course the calling card of the Conservative right. </p> <p>Much has been made in the press about the \"struggle for control\" of the party between the middle-aged Turks and the party's old guard. But that is a misrepresentation - it is far from an equal fight. The socially responsible Liberals of yesteryear are a dwindling minority, while the likes of Cable, Laws and Oaten tighten their grip on the policy agenda. The only arguments are over tactics rather than principle. Gradualists fear that too radical a shift would give the game away, hence the rows on their frontbench over whether or not to privatise the Royal Mail. </p> <p>Despite this lurch, some Labour voters have flirted with the Liberals in council and byelections, often in protest over Iraq. But too few recognise that voting for the Liberals risks letting the Tories in through the back door. In many marginal seats, a strong showing for the Lib Dems might let an unpopular Tory candidate squeak through the middle. It is also a question of what Liberals now represent. As the Tories have lurched further to the right, the Liberal Democrats have set up camp in the space they have vacated. </p> <p>Charles Kennedy says they are neither left nor right. Actually they are seeking to be both, lurching to the right in policy, while using Iraq to maintain a leftwing appeal. Sheer naked opportunism. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Hain is leader of the House of Commons and secretary of state for Wales </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hainp@parliament.uk\">hainp@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for the honor of addressing this General Assembly. The American people respect the idealism that gave life to this organization. And we respect the men and women of the U.N., who stand for peace and human rights in every part of the world. Welcome to New York City, and welcome to the United States of America. <p>During the past three years, I've addressed this General Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country, and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at a time of tremendous opportunity for the U.N. and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the circle of liberty and security and development has been expanding in our world. This progress has brought unity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and Asia, and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic chance to widen the circle even further, to fight radicalism and terror with justice and dignity, to achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom. </p> <p>The United Nations and my country share the deepest commitments. Both the American Declaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of every human life. That dignity is honored by the rule of law, limits on the power of the state, respect for women, protection of private property, free speech, equal justice, and religious tolerance. That dignity is dishonored by oppression, corruption, tyranny, bigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent. And both of our founding documents affirm that this bright line between justice and injustice -- between right and wrong -- is the same in every age, and every culture, and every nation. </p> <p>Wise governments also stand for these principles for very practical and realistic reasons. We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know that oppressive governments support terror, while free governments fight the terrorists in their midst. We know that free peoples embrace progress and life, instead of becoming the recruits for murderous ideologies. </p> <p>Every nation that wants peace will share the benefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks peace has an obligation to help build that world. Eventually, there is no safe isolation from terror networks, or failed states that shelter them, or outlaw regimes, or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others. </p> <p>In this young century, our world needs a new definition of security. Our security is not merely found in spheres of influence, or some balance of power. The security of our world is found in the advancing rights of mankind. </p> <p>These rights are advancing across the world -- and across the world, the enemies of human rights are responding with violence. Terrorists and their allies believe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the American Bill of Rights, and every charter of liberty ever written, are lies, to be burned and destroyed and forgotten. They believe that dictators should control every mind and tongue in the Middle East and beyond. They believe that suicide and torture and murder are fully justified to serve any goal they declare. And they act on their beliefs. </p> <p>In the last year alone, terrorists have attacked police stations, and banks, and commuter trains, and synagogues -- and a school filled with children. This month in Beslan we saw, once again, how the terrorists measure their success -- in the death of the innocent, and in the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was held hostage, along with her son and her nephew -- her nephew did not survive. She recently visited the cemetery, and saw what she called the \"little graves.\" She said, \"I understand that there is evil in the world. But what have these little creatures done?\" </p> <p>Members of the United Nations, the Russian children did nothing to deserve such awful suffering, and fright, and death. The people of Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have done nothing to deserve sudden and random murder. These acts violate the standards of justice in all cultures, and the principles of all religions. All civilized nations are in this struggle together, and all must fight the murderers. </p> <p>We're determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate, and the United States is grateful to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets, track down their operatives, and disrupt their plans. We're determined to end the state sponsorship of terror -- and my nation is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. We're determined to prevent proliferation, and to enforce the demands of the world -- and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many nations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlaw dictator. </p> <p>The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a cease-fire, to fully comply with all Security Council resolutions -- then ignored more than a decade of those resolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised serious consequences for his defiance. And the commitments we make must have meaning. When we say \"serious consequences,\" for the sake of peace, there must be serious consequences. And so a coalition of nations enforced the just demands of the world. </p> <p>Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough. Our broader mission as U.N. members is to apply these ideals to the great issues of our time. Our wider goal is to promote hope and progress as the alternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose is to build a better world beyond the war on terror. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have established a global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In three years the contributing countries have funded projects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total of $5.6 billion to these efforts. America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a special focus on 15 countries where the need is most urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time, and our unprecedented commitment will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of death. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have joined together to confront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We're supporting organizations that rescue the victims, passing stronger anti-trafficking laws, and warning travelers that they will be held to account for supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and children should never be exploited for pleasure or greed, anywhere on Earth. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, we should take seriously the protection of life from exploitation under any pretext. In this session, the U.N. will consider a resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning. I support that resolution and urge all governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: No human life should ever be produced or destroyed for the benefit of another. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have changed the way we fight poverty, curb corruption, and provide aid. In 2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold approach that links new aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones. And through the Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is increasing our aid to developing nations that expand economic freedom and invest in the education and health of their own people. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have acted to lift the crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing economies, and holds millions of people in poverty. Since these efforts began in 1996, poor countries with the heaviest debt burdens have received more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the build-up of future debt, my country and other nations have agreed that international financial institutions should increasingly provide new aid in the form of grants, rather than loans. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, the world must have more effective means to stabilize regions in turmoil, and to halt religious violence and ethnic cleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to respond to future crises. The United States and Italy have proposed a Global Peace Operations Initiative. G-8 countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers, initially from Africa, so they can conduct operations on that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the G-8 will help this peacekeeping force with deployment and logistical needs. </p> <p>At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are genocide. The United States played a key role in efforts to broker a cease-fire, and we're providing humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people. Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in Sudan to help improve security so aid can be delivered. The Security Council adopted a new resolution that supports an expanded African Union force to help prevent further bloodshed, and urges the government of Sudan to stop flights by military aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the Council on this timely and necessary action. I call on the government of Sudan to honor the cease-fire it signed, and to stop the killing in Darfur. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful nations must stand for the advance of democracy. No other system of government has done more to protect minorities, to secure the rights of labor, to raise the status of women, or to channel human energy to the pursuits of peace. We've witnessed the rise of democratic governments in predominantly Hindu and Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures. Democratic institutions have taken root in modern societies, and in traditional societies. When it comes to the desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of civilizations. People everywhere are capable of freedom, and worthy of freedom. </p> <p>Finding the full promise of representative government takes time, as America has found in two centuries of debate and struggle. Nor is there any -- only one form of representative government -- because democracies, by definition, take on the unique character of the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know with certainty: The desire for freedom resides in every human heart. And that desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls, or martial laws, or secret police. Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way. </p> <p>Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and we must continue to show our commitment to democracies in those nations. The liberty that many have won at a cost must be secured. As members of the United Nations, we all have a stake in the success of the world's newest democracies. </p> <p>Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. These regimes destabilized one of the world's most vital -- and most volatile -- regions. They brutalized their peoples, in defiance of all civilized norms. Today, the Iraqi and Afghan people are on the path to democracy and freedom. The governments that are rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of harboring terrorists, they're fighting terrorist groups. And this progress is good for the long-term security of us all. </p> <p>The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult conditions. They're fighting to defend their nation from Taliban holdouts, and helping to strike against the terrorists killers. They're reviving their economy. They've adopted a constitution that protects the rights of all, while honoring their nation's most cherished traditions. More than 10 million Afghan citizens -- over 4 million of them women -- are now registered to vote in next month's presidential election. To any who still would question whether Muslim societies can be democratic societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer. </p> <p>Since the last meeting of this General Assembly, the people of Iraq have regained sovereignty. Today, in this hall, the Prime Minister of Iraq and his delegation represent a country that has rejoined the community of nations. The government of Prime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every nation that believes in self-determination and desires peace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511 and 1546, the world is providing that support. The U.N., and its member nations, must respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request, and do more to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal, and free. </p> <p>A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies, because terrorists know the stakes in that country. They know that a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against their ambitions for that region. So a terrorists group associated with al Qaeda is now one of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq today -- conducting a campaign of bombings against civilians, and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition forces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists and foreign fighters, so peaceful nations around the world will never have to face them within our own borders. </p> <p>Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi security force. The NATO Alliance is providing vital training to that force. More than 35 nations have contributed money and expertise to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. And as the Iraqi interim government moves toward national elections, officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis build the infrastructure of democracy. These selfless people are doing heroic work, and are carrying on the great legacy of Sergio de Mello. </p> <p>As we have seen in other countries, one of the main terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt, and influence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist attacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach national elections. The work ahead is demanding. But these difficulties will not shake our conviction that the future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty. The proper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is to prevail. </p> <p>The advance of freedom always carries a cost, paid by the bravest among us. America mourns the losses to our nation, and to many others. And today, I assure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every enemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and security are fulfilled. </p> <p>These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East, a region where millions have been denied basic human rights and simple justice. For too long, many nations, including my own, tolerated, even excused, oppression in the Middle East in the name of stability. Oppression became common, but stability never arrived. We must take a different approach. We must help the reformers of the Middle East as they work for freedom, and strive to build a community of peaceful, democratic nations. </p> <p>This commitment to democratic reform is essential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption, and maintain ties to terrorist groups. The longsuffering Palestinian people deserve better. They deserve true leaders capable of creating and governing a free and peaceful Palestinian state. </p> <p>Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort can achieve the promise of the road map to peace. Those who would lead a new Palestinian state should adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people, and create the reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding for terrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause. </p> <p>The democratic hopes we see growing in the Middle East are growing everywhere. In the words of the Burmese democracy advocate, Aung San Suu Kyi: \"We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value. To the contrary; democracy simply means good government rooted in responsibility, transparency, and accountability.\" Here at the United Nations, you know this to be true. In recent years, this organization has helped create a new democracy in East Timor, and the U.N. has aided other nations in making the transition to self-rule. </p> <p>Because I believe the advance of liberty is the path to both a safer and better world, today I propose establishing a Democracy Fund within the United Nations. This is a great calling for this great organization. The fund would help countries lay the foundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law and independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions. Money from the fund would also help set up voter precincts and polling places, and support the work of election monitors. To show our commitment to the new Democracy Fund, the United States will make an initial contribution. I urge other nations to contribute, as well. </p> <p>Today, I've outlined a broad agenda to advance human dignity, and enhance the security of all of us. The defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the spread of prosperity, the advance of democracy -- these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the world. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together, we can accomplish so much more. </p> <p>History will honor the high ideals of this organization. The charter states them with clarity: \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\" \"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,\" \"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\" </p> <p>Let history also record that our generation of leaders followed through on these ideals, even in adversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade, members of the United Nations did not grow weary in our duties, or waver in meeting them. I'm confident that this young century will be liberty's century. I believe we will rise to this moment, because I know the character of so many nations and leaders represented here today. And I have faith in the transforming power of freedom. </p> <p>May God bless you.</p>",

  "It is good to see so many countries represented here at such a high level. I know this reflects your understanding that, in these difficult times, the United Nations is - as you stated four years ago in the Millennium Declaration - \"the indispensable common house of the entire human family\". Indeed today, more than ever, the world needs an effective mechanism through which to seek common solutions to common problems. That is what this Organization was created for. Let's not imagine that, if we fail to make good use of it, we will find any more effective instrument. <p>This time next year you will be meeting to review progress in implementing the Millennium Declaration. By then I hope you will be ready to take bold decisions together on the full range of issues covered in the Declaration, helped by the report of the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which will be available before the end of this year. As I said a year ago, we have reached a fork in the road. If you, the political leaders of the world's nations, cannot reach agreement on the way forward, history will take the decisions for you, and the interests of your peoples may go by default. </p> <p>Today I will not seek to pre-judge those decisions, but to remind you of the all-important framework in which they should be taken - namely, the rule of law, in each country and in the world. The vision of \"a government of laws and not of men\" is almost as old as civilisation itself. In a hallway not far from this podium is a replica of the code of laws promulgated by Hammurabi more than three thousand years ago, in the land we now call Iraq. Much of Hammurabi's code now seems impossibly harsh. But etched into its tablets are principles of justice that have been recognised, if seldom fully implemented, by almost every human society since his time: Legal protection for the poor. </p> <p>Restraints on the strong, so they cannot oppress the weak. Laws publicly enacted, and known to all. That code was a landmark in mankind's struggle to build an order where, instead of might making right, right would make might. Many nations represented in this chamber can 2 proudly point to founding documents of their own that embody that simple concept. And this Organization - your United Nations - is founded on the same principle. Yet today the rule of law is at risk around the world. Again and again, we see fundamental laws shamelessly disregarded - those that ordain respect for innocent life, for civilians, for the vulnerable - especially children. </p> <p>To mention only a few flagrant and topical examples: In Iraq, we see civilians massacred in cold blood, while relief workers, journalists and other non-combatants are taken hostage and put to death in the most barbarous fashion. At the same time, we have seen Iraqi prisoners disgracefully abused. In Darfur, we see whole populations displaced, and their homes destroyed, while rape is used as a deliberate strategy. In northern Uganda, we see children mutilated, and forced to take part in acts of unspeakable cruelty. In Beslan, we have seen children taken hostage and brutally massacred. In Israel we see civilians, including children, deliberately targeted by Palestinian suicide bombers. And in Palestine we see homes destroyed, lands seized, and needless civilian casualties caused by Israel's excessive use of force. </p> <p>And all over the world we see people being prepared for further such acts, through hate propaganda directed against Jews, against Muslims, against anyone who can be identified as different from one's own group. </p> <p>Excellencies, No cause, no grievance, however legitimate in itself, can begin to justify such acts. They put all of us to shame. Their prevalence reflects our collective failure to uphold the law, and to instil respect for it in our fellow men and women. We all have a duty to do whatever we can to restore that respect. To do so, we must start from the principle that no one is above the law, and no one should be denied its protection. Every nation that proclaims the rule of law at home must respect it abroad; and every nation that insists on it abroad must enforce it at home. Yes, the rule of law starts at home. But in too many places it remains elusive. Hatred, corruption, violence and exclusion go without redress. </p> <p>The vulnerable lack effective recourse, while the powerful manipulate laws to retain power and accumulate wealth. At times even the necessary fight against terrorism is allowed to encroach unnecessarily on civil liberties. At the international level, all states - strong and weak, big and small - need a framework of fair rules, which each can be confident that others will obey. Fortunately, such a framework exists. From trade to terrorism, from the law of the sea to weapons of mass destruction, States 3 have created an impressive body of norms and laws. This is one of our Organization's proudest achievements. </p> <p>And yet this framework is riddled with gaps and weaknesses. Too often it is applied selectively, and enforced arbitrarily. It lacks the teeth that turn a body of laws into an effective legal system. Where enforcement capacity does exist, as in the Security Council, many feel it is not always used fairly or effectively. Where rule of law is most earnestly invoked, as in the Commission on Human Rights, those invoking it do not always practise what they preach. Those who seek to bestow legitimacy must themselves embody it; and those who invoke international law must themselves submit to it. Just as, within a country, respect for the law depends on the sense that all have a say in making and implementing it, so it is in our global community. No nation must feel excluded. All must feel that international law belongs to them, and protects their legitimate interests. Rule of law as a mere concept is not enough. Laws must be put into practice, and permeate the fabric of our lives. </p> <p>It is by strengthening and implementing disarmament treaties, including their verification provisions, that we can best defend ourselves against the proliferation - and potential use - of weapons of mass destruction. It is by applying the law that we can deny financial resources and safe havens to terrorists - an essential element in any strategy for defeating terrorism. It is by reintroducing the rule of law, and confidence in its impartial application, that we can hope to resuscitate societies shattered by conflict. It is the law, including Security Council resolutions, which offers the best foundation for resolving prolonged conflicts - in the Middle East, in Iraq, and around the world. </p> <p>And it is by rigorously upholding international law that we can, and must, fulfil our responsibility to protect innocent civilians from genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. As I warned this Assembly five years ago, history will judge us very harshly if we let ourselves be deflected in this task, or think we are excused from it, by invocations of national sovereignty. The Security Council has just requested that I appoint an international commission to investigate reports of human rights violations in Darfur and determine whether acts of genocide have been committed. </p> <p>I shall do so with all speed. But let no one treat this as a respite, during which events in that devastated region continue to take their course. Regardless of their legal definition, things are happening there which must shock the conscience of every human being. The African Union has nobly taken the lead and the responsibility in providing monitors and a protective force in Darfur - as well as seeking a political settlement, which alone can bring 4 lasting security. But we all know the present limitations of this new-born Union. We must give it every possible support. Let no one imagine that this affair concerns Africans only. The victims are human beings, whose human rights must be sacred to us all. We all have a duty to do whatever we can to rescue them, and do it now. </p> <p>Excellencies, Last month, I promised the Security Council that I would make the Organization's work to strengthen the rule of law and transitional justice in conflict and post-conflict societies a priority for the remainder of my tenure. By the same token, I urge you all to do more to foster the rule of law at home and abroad. I ask all of you here today to take advantage of the arrangements we have made for you to sign treaties on the protection of civilians - treaties that you yourselves have negotiated - and then, go back home, to implement them fully and in good faith. And I implore you to give your full support to the measures I shall bring before you, during this session, to improve the security of United Nations staff. Those non-combatants, who voluntarily put themselves in harm's way to assist their fellow men and women, surely deserve your protection, as well as your respect. </p> <p>Throughout the world, Excellencies, the victims of violence and injustice are waiting; waiting for us to keep our word. They notice when we use words to mask inaction. They notice when laws that should protect them are not applied. I believe we can restore and extend the rule of law throughout the world. But ultimately, that will depend on the hold that the law has on our consciences. This Organization was founded in the ashes of a war that brought untold sorrow to mankind. Today we must look again into our collective conscience, and ask ourselves whether we are doing enough. </p> <p>Excellencies, Each generation has its part to play in the age-long struggle to strengthen the rule of law for all - which alone can guarantee freedom for all. Let our generation not be found wanting. Thank you very much.</p>",
  "Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, today cited the torture of Iraqi prisoners by US forces as an example of how fundamental laws were being \"shamelessly disregarded\". <p>Speaking shortly before George Bush delivered a speech in which he insisted the world was a better place since US action in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr Annan called on member countries to uphold the rule of law at home and abroad, at a time he described as a \"fork in the road\".</p> <p>He said the laws being ignored included \"those that ordain respect for civilians, for the vulnerable - especially children\" and proceeded to implicitly criticise the US by mentioning the \"disgraceful abuse\" of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib jail. </p> <p>Mr Annan also referred to hostage taking and the \"cold-blooded massacre\" of civilians in Iraq, as well as the school siege in Beslan and population displacement and rape in Darfur. He condemned the actions of Palestinian suicide bombers and \"Israel's excessive use of force... in Palestine [where] we see homes destroyed, lands seized, and needless civilian casualties\".</p> <p>UN-bashing has become a popular sport among Republicans in the US, with vice-president Dick Cheney and Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger both taking up the mantle in recent campaign speeches for Mr Bush. However, Mr Annan said: \"Today, more than ever, the world needs an effective mechanism through which to seek common solutions to common problems. That is what this organisation was created for.\"</p> <p>But Republicans' attitude towards the organisation is unlikely to soften following Mr Annan's assertion that: \"Every nation that proclaims the rule of law at home must respect it abroad; and every nation that insists on it abroad must enforce it at home... At times even the necessary fight against terrorism is allowed to encroach unnecessarily on civil liberties.\"</p> <p>Mr Annan, who last week called the US-led invasion of Iraq illegal, was speaking on the opening day of a two-week session of the UN General Assembly. He accepted some criticism of the organisation, conceding that the legal framework put in place by the UN was \"riddled with gaps and weaknesses\".</p> <p>\"Too often it is applied selectively, and enforced arbitrarily,\" he continued. \"It lacks the teeth that turn a body of laws into an effective legal system... Rule of law as a mere concept is not enough. Laws must be put into practice, and permeate their fabrics of our lives.\"</p> <p>And with Mr Bush about to get to his feet to deliver his own definition of freedom, Mr Annan concluded his speech with the words: \"Each generation has its part to play in the age-long struggle to strengthen the rule of law for all - which alone can guarantee freedom for all. Let our generation not be found wanting.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Edinburgh film festival's loss has turned out to be London's gain: the UK premiere of Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai's 2046. After the film's debut in Cannes in May, Edinburgh, with the blessing of UK distributor (and 2046 pre-buyer) Tartan Films, announced that it would be the closing night presentation. The news came as a surprise to the movie's sales agent, Fortissimo, which had been turning down festival invitations in other territories. \"Edinburgh was never planned by us or Wong Kar-wai,\" says Fortissimo co-president Wouter Barendrecht. \"We always knew that the film would be delivered just before the opening in Asia in early October.\" Only a week before Edinburgh began, the festival was forced to announce that it was replacing 2046 with E J-Yong's Korean film, Untold Scandal. Tartan had to change its release date from October 15 to early 2005. </p> <p>The story of the production's tortuous progress toward the screen is nearly as dense as that of the film itself. Wong, the lanky geek with the signature silver-rimmed shades, began shooting four years ago. He went through three cinematographers: Wong regular Christopher Doyle had to move on to another production. \"You have to realise that 80-90% of those four years were spent waiting,\" says Wong. \"We had to wait during the Sars epidemic, because many of the crew members had to go back to their home countries. We had to deal with revised actors' schedules, permits and locations.\" He grins. \"Having nothing to do for so much of the time was a problem. It also gave me a lot of time to think about changes, so I did a lot of reshooting.\" </p> <p>Then there was Cannes. Wong arrived with a bang. At the very last moment, he hand-delivered reels of the $15m feature, the festival's most eagerly anticipated movie. He had been in Paris working on computer-generated imagery (CGI), in order to create a composite of the background from material shot in different regions of Asia. The festival even had to shove the press screening of Olivier Assayas's Clean to another slot to accommodate 2046. In spite of the accusations of a publicity stunt from some quarters, Wong remained hopeful. \"If I'm so lucky to get the Palme d'Or, we've worked so hard, I think we would deserve it,\" he said at the time. Happy Together had earned him the best director award in 1997, and Tony Leung was named best actor in 2000 for In the Mood for Love. Unfortunately, Wong and 2046, arguably a masterpiece, left Cannes with a whimper - and prizeless.</p> <p>After the festival, Wong returned to Paris not only to work further on CGI but - at first in secret - to re-edit the film. To make Cannes's deadline, he had to cut out some scenes that have subsequently been reinstated. Rumours of further reshooting also surfaced, but they were unfounded. \"The stars gathered in Hong Kong to shoot publicity photos and poster images,\" says Barendrecht. </p> <p>Even some of 2046's biggest fans have found the plot extremely difficult to follow, though a second viewing clarifies things. Set mostly in the 1960s, 2046 - the Cannes version - comprises three intersecting stories. The linchpin is Chow, played by Leung, who is reprising his character from In the Mood for Love. In the earlier film, set in Hong Kong in 1962, Chow, who takes a stab at writing martial arts novels, presumably never consummates a mutually sublimated affair with Maggie Cheung's Su Li Zhen, although they know that their spouses are seeing each other. Frustrated, he leaves for Singapore. </p> <p>In 2046, Chow has returned to Hong Kong, but this softspoken man has become a hedonistic, mustachioed sleazeball. He has numerous one-night stands and earns extra money hosting dinners for low-lifes and letting out his room to their women. Still a writer, Chow is in the midst of penning a science-fiction novel set in the year 2046 - hence the title - on a train where people go to recapture their lost memories, but never return.</p> <p>As the film unravels in non-linear fashion, we realise that he is trying to forget another Su Li Zhen (Gong Li), a gloved, one-handed gambler with whom he had been involved in Singapore. She is the film's past. In a seedy Hong Kong hotel where room 2046 is loaded with meaning (it had been the rented room where Wong wrote in In the Mood for Love), several women represent the present, mainly Bai Ling (Zhang Ziyi), a ballroom dancer/prostitute who stops turning tricks out of love for him, but also Wang Jing Wen (Faye Wong), the owner's \"decent\" daughter who is in love with a Japanese man.</p> <p>The future, a visualisation of Chow's novel, features Faye Wong again, this time as an android, with Wang Jing Wen's Japanese lover (Kimura Takuya) as Chow's alter ego. Wong, with help from Fassbinder composer Peer Raben, attaches a type of music to each of the women: blues for Gong Li, 1960s dance music for Zhang Ziyi, and classical for the Faye Wong of the future.</p> <p>If the plotline seems circuitous, blame it on the late Argentinian writer Manuel Puig, whose novel The Buenos Aires Affair became, in Wong's hands, Happy Together. \"He changed my thinking about story lines,\" says Wong, who began his career as a screenwriter and script doctor. \"For example, the story in The Buenos Aires Affair is very simple, but nothing is in order. The altered order changes the significance. And you learn more because of this order. When people ask me what directors influenced my film-making most, I tell them I learned from many, but the person who's been most influential is Puig.\" </p> <p>Wong also says he intended 2046 to have the feel of a diary (faux-literary title cards punctuate the film). He was inspired by the Chinese author Liu Yichang, who emigrated to Hong Kong in 1949. \"There he wrote 20,000 words a day. Twenty years later, he published all of his work. It is a huge book, but like a diary. It manages to tell what has happened to Hong Kong in that period. And film itself is always related to changes in society.\" </p> <p>The title 2046 is more than a room number or the year in which Chow's sci-fi novel is set. \"Hong Kong went back to China in 1997,\" says Wong. \"The Chinese government promised Hong Kong 50 years without change; 2046 would be the last year of this promise. Will there be change?\" He is quick, however, to note his priorities. \"It was never my intention to make a film about politics. I'm interested in people. This is a film about someone who wants to change.\" That someone is Chow. \"He's trying to forget about his past. The problem is, the more he wants to do that, the more he realises he remembers. Things just keep coming back. He's made a lot of mistakes. The only thing left is memory.\" </p> <p>Chow lives in a state of perpetual loneliness. Wong, now 46, can empathise. His parents have passed away; his brother and sister were forced by the cultural revolution to stay behind in Shanghai after Wong emigrated to Hong Kong in 1963; and his wife of 17 years, Esther, and nine-year-old son, Cheng, spend a lot of time in New York with her relatives. Maybe he compensates with his group of recurring cast and crew members - his other family. </p> <p>Gong Li is riveting in the film, even though the diva has only 10 minutes of screen time. During the lull in production caused by the Sars outbreak, Wong worked with her on his excellent, somewhat kinky section of the short-film triptych Eros (Antonioni and Soderbergh directed the other episodes). In The Hand, the diva's hands serve a masturbatory function for Crouching Tiger's Chang Chen. After filming, Wong asked Gong Li if she would consider playing the gambler. \"I told her it was a tricky part. After five minutes, she told me she would do it. So I sent her to a casino in Macao and she started gambling. She would go there every night with her handbag of cash. Actually, we shot more than 10 minutes, but we had to have the film ready for Cannes, so I had to cut much of it. I hope someday I can make a film about her, this gambler, and the writer, still played by Tony.\" Would Gong Li work with Wong on such a film? \"Yes,\" says the actress, \"but only with more concentrated work time.\" </p> <p>As for Leung, he has the patience of Job, though with limits. \"I heard Wong was going to shoot more scenes with Gong Li and Faye Wong, so I shaved my moustache immediately,\" he says. \"You just can't go on shooting like that; you have to stop. The last two weeks of 2046: nightmare, nightmare.\" Still, he plans to work on Wong's next project, playing Bruce Lee's master. He knows it means a year of studying kung fu, but he's still willing. Chow's memory is intact, but Leung's is short indeed. </p> <p>Wong thinks that time will heal the scars he inflicted upon himself and his cast and crew. \"I think it was like being in jail for four years. No one thinks it is fun at that moment, but maybe 10 years later, for some romantic reason, they will think of it as fun.\" He shouldn't count on it.</p> <p><strong>&amp;~183;</strong> 2046 will screen at the Odeon West End on October 29 and 30 as part of the London film festival. Box office: 020-7928 3232. It goes on general release in January 2005</p>",
  "<p><strong>Town</strong><br> East London could rarely be described as lovely, but it's certainly lovable. A mish-mash of cheery cockneys, vibrant immigrant communities, organic food-buying, Victorian conversion-dwelling families and arty young things making the most of the (comparatively) low rents: there's a niche for everyone. It abuts the money-spewing City, too. Hoxton and Shoreditch really are the best places to party in the capital, and if off-beat and unusual is your style, you'll find plenty of both here. If the Olympics come to London in 2012, east London will be transformed. Best get in there now.</p> <p><strong>Gown</strong><br> Has existed in one form or another for 120 years. The handsome Victorian building is the centrepiece of the campus, in Mile End. Yes, that's right - a campus, which makes it unique among the central London University colleges. Other centres are in Whitechapel, West Smithfield and Charterhouse Square. The landmark new \u00a344m home for Barts and The London, Queen Mary's school of medicine and dentistry is set for completion in early 2005. Until recently was known as Queen Mary and Westfield College but now regards itself as Queen Mary, University of London.</p> <p><strong>Top-rated teaching departments</strong><br> Does very well in languages, English, dentistry and geography.</p> <p><strong>Top-rated research departments</strong><br> Lots to be pleased about. Four-fifths of departments were rated 4, 5 or 5* in the 2001 RAE. 5* departments were law, Hispanic studies and linguistics, followed by a strong showing of 4s and 5s.</p> <p><strong>Celebrity academics</strong><br> Queen of the media dons, Lisa Jardine, is professor of renaissance culture and intellectual history.</p> <p><strong>Head count</strong><br> 10,000 students, of whom just a smidgen over half are women. 88% come from state schools. 1,319 academic staff, of whom 63% are male.</p> <p><strong>Academic pay</strong><br> Good. History professors get \u00a356,500. Science lecturers pocket \u00a332,000 and medical researchers are on \u00a323,000.</p> <p><strong>Climate</strong><br> Feels entirely manmade, thanks to the pollution. When it's hot, London is hotter and airless. London winters have very little snow and London skies have no stars.</p> <p><strong>Transport links</strong><br> Not bad. Lots of buses and good Underground: Mile End is on the central and district lines, 15 minutes into town. No congestion charging in Mile End, but there is around Charterhouse Square. Liverpool Street is the nearest mainline station; good for getting to Stansted airport. An international train terminal at Stratford is due for completion in 2007 and if the Olympics happen, transport in the whole area will get a boost.</p> <p><strong>Entertainment</strong><br> The many delights of the capital city are there for you to enjoy. But why would you want to leave when there's so much right on your doorstep? For a nicer retail experience, try the markets at Petticoat Lane, Spitalfields and Columbia Road (plants and flowers on a Sunday morning). Brick Lane is the place for a curry, or a bagel in the middle of the night. And there's plenty to keep you up by way of bars and clubs. Leyton Orient and West Ham are the local football teams; and why not head up to Walthamstow for a spot of dog-racing?</p> <p><strong>Schools</strong><br> Tower Hamlets is your local LEA - it performs below average in the league tables, and it'd be fair to say that you don't get much more inner-city than this. But it is regarded as very much on the up and there are some fine schools. Try Bonner or Stewart Headlam primary schools, or Thomas Buxton junior. Mulberry school for girls is one of the best in the borough, or try Sir John Cass foundation and Redcoat CofE secondary school (stick there for A-levels, too).</p> <p><strong>House prices</strong><br> East London offers everything from the scummiest estates to lots of tasteful renovations. On average, it's on the cheaper side - maybe \u00a3350,000 for a three-bed house - but that will fluctuate wildly depending on area and age. Still plenty of period stuff in the more colourful areas that are waiting to up-and-come, which they probably will.</p> <p><strong>What to say in the common room ...</strong><br> \"This department's going to the dogs.\" \"Work night out to Walthamstow?\" \"No.\"</p> <p><strong>The essentials</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.qmul.ac.uk\">www.qmul.ac.uk</a></p> <p>To order a copy of the Guardian University Guide 2005 for \u00a314.99 with free UK p&amp;p, call 0870-066 7850</p>",

  "Liberal Democrat activists today opposed the mention of city academies and specialist schools in the party's education policy. <p>The motion on education proposed to the Bournemouth conference today by the party's education spokesman, Phil Willis, backed diversity of provision through city academies, specialist schools and others subject to equality of access.</p> <p>Under the proposals, a single admissions system would replace the myriad arrangements currently governing access to different schools, which would be operated through the establishment of a local education authority-run Office for Fair Access for Schools. </p> <p>This would ensure a level playing field for students and end the confusion faced by parents up and down the country, Mr Willis told Guardian Unlimited.</p> <p>But an amendment was inserted to remove reference to privately-funded city academies and schools that receive extra injections of cash for having a specialism. </p> <p>Voting was 149 in favour of the amendment, 102 against. The amended motion was carried. </p> <p>Supporting the amendment, north-west Hampshire councillor John Wall said: \"It is all too easy to suggest that academies and specialist schools are the answer to school education needs. </p> <p>\"They are not. They are the Labour government's answers. We should be brave enough to get back to basics and say we will provide high-quality schooling in all areas. </p> <p>\"People do not really need choice if they are sure of quality where they live.\" </p> <p>Provided there was access to a good school, \"no further gilding or name change is need\", he added. </p> <p>But Julia Goldsworthy, the prospective parliamentary candidate for Falmouth and Camborne, said the amendment would not change existing party policy. </p> <p>\"No one would want to return home from conference to accusations from our opponents that we want to close the local and often very successful specialist schools and academies. It's just not practical politics,\" she warned.</p> <p>Mr Willis said later that there were no plans to abolish either city academies or specialist schools if the Lib Dems came to power, though \"they would be brought under local authority control\".</p>",
  "<p>Restless Legs Syndrome sounds like a charter for whingers - unless you happen to suffer from it yourself. We can all get twitchy legs occasionally, especially in bed at night. But the full-blown syndrome can ruin your sleep and drive you to distraction. </p> <p>Up to 10% of us are bothered by an irresistible urge to move our legs, pins and needles and a restlessness which gets better after exercise and worse after sitting or lying still. Like most symptoms, it's worse at night and can seriously disturb your sleep, not to mention your partner's. Like most conditions, it becomes more common as you get older. </p> <p>Children can have RLS too but they probably don't get taken seriously very often unless they have particularly attentive parents. According to Dr John Shneerson, director of Papworth Hospital Sleep Centre in Cambridge, children with restless legs may be misdiagnosed as having growing pains or even attention deficit disorder. </p> <p>Restless legs sufferers sometimes describe their symptoms in very graphic terms. \"Like bugs crawling under the skin\", or \"creeping, indescribable, electric current-like\". It can make them get up and pace around for hours or toss and turn violently to try to alleviate the unpleasant sensations. Anything that messes up your sleep can mess up your life so it's not surprising to find reports of RLS ruining careers and relationships. </p> <p>RLS was first described nearly 70 years ago but is now gaining greater medical attention with Britain's first medical conference on the affliction taking place in London next month. But despite the medical, and pharmaceutical interest, it can be hard to be taken seriously by your GP and few sufferers are referred to a neurologist in this country. </p> <p>It's quite possible that many GPs dismiss restless legs as a cry for attention; a hallmark of depression or anxiety. But it is a recognised neurological disorder, thought to be due to some malfunction in the part of the brain responsible for movement. It tends to run in families, suggesting that there's a gene responsible. Rarely, there's some underlying cause such as iron deficiency, pregnancy, diabetes, a slipped disc or kidney failure. Occasionally, restless legs are a side effect of drug treatment with an antidepressant. </p> <p>Rather than dismissing you, a GP should examine you thoroughly and carry out blood tests to check iron levels, kidney function and for diabetes. Correcting underlying problems like low iron stores, can help the restless legs but sadly, in most cases, the tests will come back as normal and your doctor will be at a loss. </p> <p>Shneerson advises cutting down on caffeine, which often makes symptoms worse. \"Ask yourself if you've started any new drugs which might be responsible. Antihistamines as well as antidepressants can make it worse.\" Other useful advice is to keep your feet cool in the evenings by going barefoot or putting a fan on your feet in bed. Stretching, massaging and exercising your legs helps the restlessness but the symptoms often come back. Typically, the sensations and movements start in the evening and continue into the night but are better by the morning. </p> <p>Because it is a movement disorder, drugs used in Parkinson's disease can be helpful. The drugs carbidopa-levodopa boosts dopamine levels in the brain which helps transmit messages between nerves responsible for movement. The drug helps many though it may ironically disturb your sleep and cause tummy upsets. </p> <p>The best drug around, according to John Shneerson, is probably ropinirole though it isn't yet licensed for use in restless legs. Pergolide is another drug which boosts dopamine and can be prescribed by neurologists in severe cases. It tends to make you sleepy so is usually only prescribed at night. Codeine-based drugs can help but are potentially addictive and cause constipation and tiredness. Benzodiazepines like Valium often help but are definitely addictive and makes you dopey the next day. Drugs, such as gabapentin, which are used to treat epilepsy, are sometimes advised. </p> <p>For those who want to avoid heavy duty drugs, Vitamin E, folic acid and magnesium supplements from a health food shop are harmless if you don't exceed the recommended dose. </p> <p><strong>'I'm a victim and deserve sympathy'</strong></p> <p>Paul MacInnes says his wife gets the worst of it.</p> <p>When a young Michael Jackson found he just couldn't, he just couldn't control his feet, he blamed it on the boogie. A generation later, he would surely have known better: he, like me, would realise that he suffered from Restless Legs Syndrome, or RLS. His roving feet were not representative of a state of mind, but a genuine medical condition. </p> <p>Click on the link marked \"I have restless legs!\" on the website of the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation (based in Rochester, Minnesota) and the facts are laid out simply. RLS is an \"overwhelming urge to move the legs, usually caused by uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs\". </p> <p>This unpleasantness is more acute at the end of the day and is known to disrupt sleep. As many as 6 million people are believed to suffer from the condition in the UK, which makes you wonder why we've never heard of it before. </p> <p>Perhaps it's something to do with the privacy of what goes on behind the bedroom door - even if it is simply the gentle rubbing of aching calf muscles against linen. I have had RLS for as long as I can remember (or \"the leg thing\" as it's known around our way), but have never sought medical advice, joined a support group or, even, chucked it into conversation at a dinner party. </p> <p>This may be because, as I see it, my RLS is something of an indulgence. The way my legs will inveterately rub up and down as if working out very slowly on a soft, horizontal exercise bike is the perfect way to send myself to sleep. Sure, I only perform the actions because my muscles are aching, but I find fatigue a reassuring sensation at the end of a day - almost as if I'd done something more taxing than sitting plonk in front of a desk. </p> <p>Gradually, as the rhythm slowly builds (this isn't meant to sound sensual, by the way, but most people will, at some point, have experienced the pleasurable effects of self-massage), each motion provides a short wave of comfort and relief from a dull pain of about the size that would occasion a headache in a hedgehog. Soon after, I am off. </p> <p>To be honest, my natural inclination would be to assume that RLS is a makey-uppy ailment; a physical condition, for sure, but one that has probably existed long before it was discovered, without causing millions of people to wonder why they can't stop shuffling in bed. </p> <p>Thinking about it a little longer though, reading that some cases can require serious treatment, I also remember the rare moments when, while in the throes of the leg thing, my limbs seem suddenly to leap into a state of nervous tension, as if my skin is standing on end. </p> <p>No doubt the UK's first conference on RLS, to be held next month, will go further to establishing how much of an affliction it really is. Until then, however, there are real victims who should not be forgotten; those who have to lie in bed with the wriggling millions. </p> <p>My wife it was who first identified my behaviour as something other than normal and it is she, while I am quietly miming the Tour de France, who lies there wishing I would stop. She likens the leg thing to a dodgy car alarm: repetitive, persistent and the kind of irritation you are certain could be avoided if only the culprit had the will to fix it. </p> <p>For a while I could see her point, but thought I lacked the will to change. Now I know better: I am a victim and deserve some sympathy. Either that, or some cushioned leg-irons. <br><strong> Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> RLS conference is at the Royal Society of Medicine, 1 Wimpole St, London W1G on October 1. <br>Details: 020-8333 3030; <br>Email: <a href=\"mailto:suzanne.tulk@uhl.nhs.uk\">suzanne.tulk@uhl.nhs.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Dr Rosy Daniel is well known among cancer specialists. As the medical director of the famed Bristol Cancer Help Centre, she has spent years trying to change attitudes towards cancer and encourage her own \"holistic\" vision. With Prince Charles as patron of the centre, Dr Daniel's emphasis on treating cancer by emphasising diet and healthy living, positive visualisation and changing lifestyle, became increasingly well known. Despite many sceptics. </p> <p>Now Daniel appears to have put her reputation on the line for a herbal remedy that hasn't yet had any clinical trials. She's gone public with her conviction that Carctol, an unlicensed Indian herbal medicine, may be the cancer cure that people are looking for. Her PR team has even issued a release entitled, \"Has Dr Rosy Daniel Found the Herbal Cure for Cancer?\" It's a question that has enraged many in the medical establishment. </p> <p>\"What on earth is this about?\" asks Professor Robert Souhami, executive director of Cancer Research UK. \"The idea that this is a substitute for proper intervention is laughable. She's talking a kind of bad science.\" </p> <p>Souhami is angry because he sees the claims as the latest in a stream of assertions from alternative practitioners which appear to offer cures for cancer - without backing them up with proper research. \"What responsible cancer doctor would follow this up when she hasn't followed it up herself?\" he asks. \"This makes people in a vulnerable and difficult position feel that they ought to give it a go, but no one should say anything about the results of therapies unless they know what they're saying is true.\" </p> <p>Daniel, who now works as medical director of a private company, Health Creation, still treats patients with cancer. Her philosophy remains the holistic approach that she used at Bristol, and she knows the sceptics are out there. \"I've been working with integrated healthcare approaches in cancer for 20 years,\" she says. \"I think it's important to keep an open mind and I'm on the side of the patient. That's the bottom line, even though doctors might want to hang me and burn me as a witch.\" </p> <p>Daniel's words give an idea of the pressure she's under. But she hasn't helped herself with the way her latest discovery is being explained. Her story was given extraordinary prominence in yesterday's Daily Telegraph under the headline \"I've seen herbal remedy make tumours disappear, says respected cancer doctor\". </p> <p>Daniel herself says she is not making a scientific claim for Carctol, but merely observing a phenomenon. \"All science starts from hypothesis,\" she states. \"I'm not saying this is the answer, but I have stuck my neck out and prescribed it.\" Her press release, however, talks of \"walking miracles\" and quotes Daniel as saying it is \"thrilling\" to have \"finally found a herbal medicine which can be a lifesaver\". </p> <p>The problem is that Daniel has not done any medical trials on Carctol, a mixture of eight herbal medicines. She says she has prescribed it to around 860 patients - about a quarter were helped, a quarter were not helped at all, and around half were helped to some extent. It's hardly a methodical or thorough assessment. </p> <p>\"People who make huge claims but fail to collect the data are irresponsible,\" says Dr Rob Stein, consultant medical oncologist at UCLH. \"We need systematic and rigorous trials, but that's not happening here. Many of my patients do check out complementary therapies. They do it because it empowers them and that's fine. It's a very natural desire of people to help themselves. But whether any of it actually works is very much open to question. </p> <p>\"The difficulty is that we are told about the successes, but not the total number of people taking these remedies. I personally don't believe it, but if it makes people feel better about themselves that's fine. The only thing it hurts is their wallets.\" </p> <p>Daniel herself - who explains that it is only possible to receive Carctol on prescription in this country, at around \u00a390 a month - admits that she was unsure when she first heard about the drug. But she then met the Indian doctor who developed the treatment, Dr Nandlal Tiwari from Rajasthan, and she says his results are astonishing. </p> <p>\"When I was director at Bristol we got sent things all the time. But this one has living proof,\" she says. </p> <p>The theory is that cancer is connected with acid levels in the body. Taking Carctol - and drinking lots of water, changing your diet and taking a digestive enzyme, all as recommended by Dr Tiwari - makes that acid level more alkaline and stops the cancer from thriving. </p> <p>\"It's complete scientific nonsense,\" says Souhami. \"The body can't be made more acid or alkaline. Acidity is very tightly controlled. The problem for people like me is that you're seen to be some kind of medical fascist who wants to do people down, and that's not true at all. Our culture in orthodox medicine is that everything should be tested. What's difficult about people like Daniel is that she doesn't start from that point. She believes in a general kind of philosophy of cancer.\" </p> <p>Souhami is particularly dubious about the recommendations that Carctol should be taken with a changed diet, digestive enzymes and \"cooled, boiled water.\" </p> <p>\"What is it that is actually supposed to be working?\" he asks. \"How do you test all this out? There's no explanation why the water has to be that particular amount, or why it has to be cooled or boiled. It sounds to me like a triumph of wishful thinking. It's selling a package, trying to make cancer patients feel in control of their body, which is no bad thing, but this is serious for people. You have to be careful.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, Prince Charles was roundly criticised by the cancer specialist Professor Michael Baum for singing the praises of the Gerson therapy, a particular diet which is said to help cancer sufferers. </p> <p>\"I have much time for complementary therapy that offers improvements in quality of life or spiritual solace,\" wrote Baum, \"providing that it is truly integrated with modern medicine. But I have no time at all for 'alternative' therapy that places itself above the laws of evidence and practises in a metaphysical domain that harks back to the dark days of Galen.\" </p> <p>For many, Daniel and her treatments are seen in a similar way, despite the claims of her patients that they have been helped by her approach. In fact, Daniel herself emphasises that Carctol can be used with conventional medicine and says she is keen for medical trials to be carried out. </p> <p>\"I have given 20 years of my lifeblood and passion to work and help people with cancer and I'm always happy to be someone there at the edge,\" she says. \"I'm happy for this to be used with conventional medicine, but I've met people who say they would rather die than have chemotherapy. Why not give them a choice, chemo or herbal medicine? Quite often chemo is oversold because there is nothing else. I would hope this is the something else. </p> <p>\"I always get criticism, but if your life was threatened and there was a source of hope, you might want to know about it. I am happy to say that this needs research and it is essential to do trials. But some patients say they can't wait for evidence.

  "<p>John Kerry sought to galvanise his campaign by delivering his most withering attack yet on George Bush's Iraq policy. Speaking in New York on Monday night, Mr Kerry said the administration's record was filled with \"deceptive statements and errors of judgment of historic proportions\".</p> <p>The tough speech must have been a tonic for Democratic supporters exasperated by Mr Kerry's inability to turn the administration's inept handling of Iraq to his advantage. He has been taking the fight to Mr Bush in recent days on issues from gun control to links between Halliburton, the oil services giant, and the administration, and now Iraq. </p> <p>But beating up on the president carries risks, notes Marc Sandalow of the <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/09/19/KERRY.TMP\">San Franciso Chronicle</a>.</p> <p>If the attacks come across as too strident, they could alienate voters who are reluctant to change presidents during a war. Never at a loss on how to hit back, the Republicans are now calling Mr Kerry the new Howard Dean.</p> <p>George Packer, of the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/?040927ta_talk_packer\">New Yorker</a>, provides a useful compare and contrast exercise between Mr Bush's rhetoric on Iraq and the worsening situation there. He chronicles the White House's ruthless determination to put a positive spin on - or simply disregard - bad news from Iraq. Packer makes the telling observation that public approval of Mr Bush's handling of the war rose between May and September - just when coverage of events in Iraq dropped off the front pages of the Washington Post and the New York Times.</p> <p>Packer thinks the press is unfair in pressuring Mr Kerry for a detailed strategy on how to deal with the mess in Iraq. He writes: \"The president's actions have led the country into a blind alley; there's no new strategy for Kerry to propose, and the press should stop insisting that he come up with one when the candidate who started the war feels no such obligation.\"</p> <p>On Iraq, an issue on which Mr Kerry has been accused of flip-flopping, it is worth reading his <a href=\"http://www.independentsforkerry.org/uploads/media/kerry-iraq.html\">Senate speech</a> in October 2002 before his vote to grant Bush authority to go to war. Although the vote has been the source of much grief, the speech was actually a cogent argument, with Mr Kerry saying he would not support \"a unilateral war against Iraq unless the threat is imminent\".</p> <p>CK Rairden, of the <a href=\"http://www.washingtondispatch.com/opinion/article_10108.shtml\">Washington Dispatch</a>, sees a problem for Mr Kerry beyond Iraq - the man himself. Rairden, exasperated by Mr Kerry's inability to connect with the voters, calls him \"aloof and an absolute bore\", and says he had better loosen up or he will go down as Michael Dukakis II.</p> <p>Amid all the speeches and the campaigning, Kerry found time to appear on the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132973,00.html\">David Letterman</a> show where he came out with his \"top ten Bush tax </p> <p>proposals\".

  "<p>Fulham have brought in lawyers for advice on the best way to fight a mass of Football Association disciplinary charges which could also land manager Chris Coleman and several of his players with major suspensions and fines.</p> <p>The Londoners are in hot water after Saturday's stormy 1-1 draw at West Brom when they had Papa Bouba Diop and Andy Cole sent off. </p> <p>Albion's Neil Clement was dismissed by referee Mike Dean after one yellow card for diving and another for a professional foul on Luis Boa Morte. </p> <p>The incidents came just a week after outspoken boss Coleman slammed another referee, Mark Halsey, for overturning, on a linesman's advice, a decision to give Fulham a penalty against Arsenal after a mass protest by the Arsenal players. The Highbury side went on to win 3-0. </p> <p>The FA have since thrown the book at Fulham and, although the club are not officially commenting yet, chairman Mohammed Al Fayed is renowned for taking recourse to law especially when financial matters are at stake. </p> <p>Even so he could be heading for a showdown with Coleman who has vowed to stand by his players having called a challenge by Albion's Darren Purse, which sparked the trouble with Diop, \"a coward's tackle, a real leg-breaker\". </p> <p>A statement released on the club's website http://www.fulhamfc.co.uk today confirmed they will \"heavily fine\" both Cole and Diop who \"should have known better than to react unlawfully\" even though Fulham do not accept all the charges that have been brought. Albion's former Chelsea player Clement also faces disciplinary action. </p> <p>Fulham could be hit with a maximum fine of \u00a3250,000 after Dean reported the whole team for what he called continual harassment. The official said: \"It seemed to me that they went purposely, every time I gave a decision, to harass me throughout the game.\" </p> <p>The Fulham statement said: \"Fulham Football Club does not accept all the charges brought against them by the FA following the match against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns last Saturday. Nevertheless the club does not condone the actions of its players Papa Bouba Diop and Andrew Cole who were dismissed from the field of play during that match. </p> <p>\"Having participated at the highest levels of the game Papa Bouba and Andrew should have known better than to react unlawfully to the provocation to which they were apparently subjected by certain West Bromwich Albion players. Violent conduct, whether provoked or otherwise, is is totally unacceptable to Fulham Football Club and both players are to be heavily fined by the club for their misbehaviour.\" </p> <p>Fulham were enraged by a first-half penalty decision and saw Collins John and Edwin Van Der Sar booked for protesting. Dean sent off Cole, who lashed out at Clement soon after the midfielder's cynical challenge on Boa Morte, and Diop for violent conduct after his clash with Purse. </p> <p>Fulham have been charged with failing to ensure their players conducted themselves properly. But Coleman's charge of bringing the game into disrepute relates to his comments about Halsey following the match against Arsenal a week earlier when the official also ruled out a perfectly good looking goal by John and could be just as damaging. </p> <p>The former Wales international, the youngest manager in the Premiership at 34, faces a touchline ban as well as a heavy fine. The FA, who studied video evidence, are set to hear the case on October 6.</p>",
  "<p>The government today announced a new system of tax relief for film producers - saying it is more generous than the previous scheme, and less open to abuse.</p> <p>Ministers said the new arrangements, to be introduced in July 2005, will help ensure the UK remains a major international centre for film-making.</p> <p>The tax breaks replace a previous arrangement, \"Section 48\", which was withdrawn in February to howls of outrage from film producers and investors.</p> <p>Details of the new scheme, which will enable producers to claim up to \u00a34m a film in tax relief, were announced by the paymaster general, Dawn Primarolo, following months of negotiations between the Treasury and the industry.</p> <p>The industry was thrown into chaos earlier this year after the Inland Revenue announced it was closing the old \"Section 48\" tax relief, which it said was being exploited as a loophole. Some investors were reportedly pouring money into projects in order to secure a quick tax return, with little expectation that the films would ever reach the cinemas.</p> <p>But film-makers complained that the government was pulling the rug from under their feet, and some projects reportedly shut down when their business model was undermined by the change in the rules. Tulip Fever, starring Jude Law in a literary adaptation, was the most prominent casualty, while The Libertine, starring Johnny Depp, was rescued by help from the Isle of Man film fund.</p> <p>Ms Primarolo, who tonight hosts a reception for industry representatives at 11 Downing Street, said the new scheme would build on the success of Section 48 in encouraging investment in British films while being less open to abuse.</p> <p>\"This new, more generous relief will ensure that the UK continues to be recognised as one of the best places in the world to make a film,\" she said.</p> <p>Arts minister Estelle Morris added: \"This new tax relief underlines the government's commitment to a stable, sustainable and successful film industry that will go on producing award-winners like Mike Leigh's Vera Drake.</p> <p>\"In particular, the relief delivers on our determination to remain a major centre for international film-making.\"</p> <p>The new scheme will enable producers to claim up to 20% of their costs (from 15% under Section 48), up to a total budget of \u00a320m (from \u00a315m under the previous deal). The relief will be paid on completion of the film in order to limit the scope for abuse.</p> <p>John Woodward, chief executive officer of the UK Film Council, broadly welcomed the announcement.</p> <p>\"Obviously, as with Section 48, the new tax credit will take a few months to bed down but it is extremely good news that the new relief will apply to 100% of the film's costs - rather than just the money spent in the UK,\" he said.</p> <p>The new tax relief is available to qualifying \"British\" films, as defined by the government, whose total production costs are under the \u00a320m figure. Although it comes into effect in July 2005, transitional arrangements will apply between now and then.</p> <p>It applies to all production expenditure, not just that which is spent in the UK - and is payable to production companies, not investors.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone familiar with the British antiwar protests before the invasion of Iraq last year is likely to have come across the phrase \"Make tea, not war\" and a <a href=\"http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2003/Feb/15/make_tea_not_war.html\">placard</a> showing a gun-wielding Tony Blair with an inverted teacup on his head. </p> <p>Taiwan's <a href=\"http://163.29.3.66/\">defence ministry</a> has an interesting twist on the theme and, according to <strong>Reuters</strong>, is asking the island's population to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;storyID=6291537\">drink less tea</a> to allow it to \"afford\" a \u00a310bn defence package from the US.

  "Iran today defied international calls for it to end fuel manufacture, announcing that it had begun preparing uranium ore for enrichment. <p>Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, said the country - which maintains it has no military ambitions for its nuclear programme - was converting 37 tonnes of raw yellowcake uranium into a state suitable for nuclear centrifuges.</p> <p>\"The tests have been successful, but these tests have to be continued using the rest of the material,\" he told reporters at the general conference of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog.</p> <p>Iran had told the IAEA it intended to begin tests of its uranium conversion facilities, but today's announcement came less than 48 hours after the board of governors passed a resolution calling on Iran to halt all activities linked to enrichment. The US, the EU and Russia yesterday urged Tehran to comply with the demand. </p> <p>Mohammad Khatami, Iran's reformist president, had earlier restated his country's opposition to calls to end enrichment, saying Iran was prepared to continue its nuclear programme either with or without international supervision.</p> <p>His comments - an endorsement of Tehran's threat to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - indicated that reformers were as committed to pursuing a nuclear programme as hardliners.</p> <p>Mr Khatami said the Islamic republic had no intention of building nuclear weapons, but would not be stopped from developing a civilian programme. \"We've made our choice - yes to peaceful nuclear technology, no to atomic weapons,\" he said in a speech at a military parade.</p> <p>Experts have speculated that Iran's yellowcake could yield as many as five nuclear warheads if it were to be used for that purpose.</p> <p>Weapons-grade uranium can be obtained by further enriching fuel intended for a civilian reactor. Signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty are required to open up their civilian facilities to IAEA inspectors to prove that the programmes are not being adapted for military purposes.</p> <p>Following a week of behind the scenes debate between the US, the major European countries and non-aligned nations, the IAEA warned Iran to freeze \"all uranium enrichment-related activities\".</p> <p>Under Iran's international treaty obligations, it is allowed to enrich uranium - meaning any suspension has to be voluntary and cannot be compelled by outsiders. Preventing it from manufacturing its own fuel is thought to be the best way of making sure it does not build a bomb.</p> <p>Tehran rejected the IAEA's warning, threatening to pull out of the non-proliferation treaty if it was referred - as the resolution implicitly threatened - to the UN security council for possible sanctions. </p> <p>Washington accuses Iran of running a covert nuclear weapons programme. The IAEA, which has been investigating the country's nuclear programme for two years, has found many previously concealed activities that could have been used in a weapons programme, but no \"smoking gun\" to confirm US suspicions.</p>",

  "<p>As is becoming traditional in European film festivals this season, American artists are taking every opportunity to criticise President Bush: this time it's Woody Allen and the occasion is the San Sebasti\u00e1n film festival. </p> <p>While in town to present new feature Melinda and Melinda and to receive a lifetime achievement award, Allen said that were Bush re-elected in November, it would be \"tragic, extremely tragic\". He added that the current White House resident may come across as a funny character but that US politics were anything but: \"If you observe [Bush], it's quite amusing. If you listen to him as he speaks, if you follow him closely, it would provide you a great many laughs. </p> <p>\"But it's the perfect example of islands of comedy, comic moments against a very, very tragic background.\" Allen's criticism comes after directors Jonathan Demme and Wim Wenders condemned the state of American politics at the Venice film festival earlier this month. </p> <p>Allen made his comments on Friday, on the opening day of a San Sebasti\u00e1n festival that has already showcased Michael Winterbottom's sexually explicit love story, Nine Songs, and the first showing of Oliver Stone's second documentary about Fidel Castro, Looking for Fidel.

  "<p>University bosses are dreaming in sums. In vice- chancellors' offices up and down the country, there are waste-paper baskets over-flowing with discarded paper covered in scribbled numbers; on the desktop, computers strain with spreadsheets. Accountants, financial officers and marketing staff are close at hand.</p> <p>Institutions are trying to work out what to do about the introduction of top-up fees next year. Decisions need to be taken now, and questions swim through a vice-chancellor's mind. Can we get away with charging \u00a33, 000? Will students think we're second-rate if we don't? What will attract them to paying that figure? And how are we going satisfy the Office for Fair Access (Offa)? They wonder how people see them, what their purpose is and whether they are getting it right. English universities, among the most respected and oldest in the world, are embarking on a midlife crisis.</p> <p>Universities have already been read the riot act by the Department for Education and Skills, and strictly warned against discussing their pricing plans with one another. Discuss it and they will be accused of fee-fixing, as some public schools were last year, and prosecuted. It is tempting to imagine Soprano-style scenes featuring a cartel of vice-chancellors meeting in a smoke-filled room but, they insist, it's not going to happen.</p> <p>The pressure is on. Most are working towards a December deadline, by which time they will have to send their 2005 prospectus to press, and it will include their prices for 2006. Some are rebranding for the top-up fee launch, starting with the prospectus. Meanwhile, many are already drawing up their access agreements for Offa, even before its director is picked. Everything depends on this term.</p> <p>Education Guardian today reveals the most complete impression to date of what vice-chancellors are planning. Seventy-two vice-chancellors, directors and principals of universities and higher education colleges in England have taken part in this survey, which tracks the decisions they are making and offers the most up-to-date picture of the true impact the introduction of top-up fees will have in 2006 on students and their universities.</p> <p>We approached the head of every university and higher education college in England, plus the two universities in Northern Ireland that are likely to follow the Westminster model - a total of 120 institutions. . Their nerves were palpable - 46 didn't respond. Most of those just weren't prepared to share the information at such a sensitive time, though in a few cases a holiday got in the way. Several - 17 - were prepared to provide us with answers only on the condition that they remained anonymous.</p> <p>The institution heads were asked about their expectations of what will happen in 2006. Many still have to confirm their plans through their ruling councils, but practically all know in which direction they are headed: \u00a33, 000 across-the-board for every single student, for every single course.</p> <p>In many ways, that has been the easy decision. What is foxing them is the bursaries: how to invent a scheme to satisfy their widening participation targets while saving enough cash to keep the university going is proving to be a logistical nightmare. Get it wrong and they fear what the consequences might be.</p> <p>Stuart Bartholomew, director of the Arts Institute in Bournemouth, speaks for a large chunk of the sector when he says: \"We are entering a quasi-market system that is totally untested and lacks knowledge; we are going to go through a troubled two or three years. \"</p> <p>Put another way, by the head of a large, urban, post-1992 university: \"There's an operable range of \u00a335m between charging the full whack and charging nothing for us. That's how big the decision is. We're flying without navigation. \"</p> <p>Eight institutions declared they are planning to vary fees: Anglia Polytechnic University, the University of Central England, Luton University, Plymouth University, Ravensbourne College of Design &amp;Communication, the College of St Mark and St John, University College Winchester and one other that wished to remain anonymous. The vast majority of the others were unflinching in their decision to charge \u00a33, 000.</p> <p>Of the 15 that are yet to decide either way the decision is crucial. Professor Diana Green of Sheffield Hallam University, which has yet to confirm its plans, says: \"This is entirely about how we present the institution ... The critical thing we have to do is think about what all universities are doing and think about it in the context of what people think about Sheffield Hallam. \"</p> <p>Her view is backed up by some of the market research that has taken place: vice-chancellors at the Universities UK conference last week were firmly informed by one marketing agency that students, and perhaps as importantly their parents, will see cheaper courses as second rate. But according to many of the responses, they already knew that. \"We'd like to see the standard of the university reflected in the fee by charging the full amount, \" says Professor Kel Fidler of Northumbria, who confirmed his university is going all the way to \u00a33, 000.</p> <p>The onus for Fidler and his colleagues in the new universities is on bursary schemes, to offset any deterrent effect of charging full fees. But whereas many older universities are talking about their bursary schemes in terms of a percentage of their fee income - a third in most - universities that are doing well at widening participation don't have that luxury.</p> <p>For Professor Les Ebdon at Luton, the bursary is the trickiest aspect of the conundrum. \"That's the most challenging decision we have to make. We think it's important to offer bursaries to our students. But 50% will qualify for the full bursaries so we have to work it out carefully. \"It's one of the things which is most ironic about the whole new package that some universities will have to give nothing, and others across the board. \"</p> <p>The degree of uncertainty over bursaries is reflected in the figures. Sixty- six confirmed they were expecting to introduce their own bursaries, but 43 of those would (or could) not give details. Twelve said they would guarantee the minimum \u00a3300 - the government's condition to allow them to charge \u00a33, 000 - but were looking to offer more than that. Only one vice-chancellor, Dr Peter Knight at the University of Central England in Birmingham, said firmly he would offer just a bare minimum of \u00a3300, which will go to the most needy students and, in a few cases, to those who do less popular courses.</p> <p>Three vice-chancellors said they would offer between \u00a3300 and \u00a31, 000; seven said \u00a31, 001-\u00a32, 000;and another seven said between \u00a32, 001 and the Cambridge levels of \u00a34, 000 per student on a means-tested basis.</p> <p>There are a plethora of variables that universities are contending with to set the bursaries, at the heart of which lie two apparently incompatible imperatives: social responsibility and market forces. Among the questions institutions are grappling with are: do universities give lots of little bursaries or a few big ones and what effect will that have on the market? Do you give them exclusively to the needy, or do you use them as a sweetener to entice students on to less popular courses? If you give only to the needy, is there a danger that some courses will fold?</p> <p>However, while many institutions plan simply to tie their bursaries to the government grants, others are coming up with elaborate schemes to pit a student's background against their intellect and course of study in the competition for cash. Birmingham is among them. It has invented a matrix that assesses applications according to their A-level points, where they live (local students will score more), how much they need the money and the subject they choose. They will also gain extra points for \"added value \" - any sporting or musical achievements. Professor Michael Sterling, vice-chancellor of Birmingham, says: \"It's not just about poor students but about excellent students as well, and recruiting to certain subjects. \"</p> <p>Some universities are keenly pointing out that they will benefit the \"nearly poor as well as the very poor \", while some say they will offer more hardship funds than bursaries, or scholarships to pick out talent instead. How students will get their heads round the range of sometimes highly complicated schemes on offer is unclear.</p> <p>The bursaries are part of the sums the vice-chancellors are doing in their bid to sign up students. But here is the most visible manifestation of their identity crisis. To help them assess their place in the brave new market of top-up fees, 21 (the vast majority of them from new universities)have employed outside experts to help them: professional marketers or brand managers. Other vice-chancellors, such as Sir Howard Davies at the London School of Economics, said they had all the expertise they needed within the university: \"Some of the people who have done the research on fees are in the LSE - we have a centre for economics of education. \"</p> <p>Birmingham is planning a root-and- branch reform of its branding after research revealed it was \"dull and conservative\" and, worse still, regarded as \"inferior\" to close competitors such as Nottingham and Warwick. Birmingham is spending \u00a3100, 000 on revamping that image - including employing Wolff Olins, the company responsible for creating the image of Tate Modern and Orange mobile phones, to do a \"brand audit \" to spruce it up a bit and give a new \"edgy \" reputation.</p> <p>At Brunel, Professor Steven Schwartz dismisses the idea of employing an agency to help it with its image: \"So many university brands are so innocuous. \" Schwartz collected some of the slogans that universities use for a talk to an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) meeting in Paris on university image. They included \"learn for life \", \"a university for the real world \", \"tomorrow's leaders today \", \"advancing knowledge, transforming lives \"and \"together we are amazing \".</p> <p>\"What do these slogans mean? \" he asked in his talk. \"The answer is, not very much. As Goethe says in Faust: 'When ideas fail, words come in very handy'. \" He argued that there was too much spin in university branding and that universities will increasingly be caught out by students who feel they have not met their promises. He is campaigning for a code of ethics for university marketing.</p> <p>Most universities are also planning to make sure they have something concrete to offer students in return for the fees they will have to pay. Every single university mentioned bursaries and improving student facilities in its spending plans. Only three - Imperial, Brunel and one new university - thought they would have something left over to help bump up their research rating; recognition that student expectations are going to demand more of them.</p> <p>Professor Roland Levinsky at Plymouth University explains its spending priorities: \"It's threefold: first, bursaries, second, staff pay; and third, as a university which is a thrown-together hotchpotch of 1960s buildings, I want to get really good student facilities, sports facilities and water sports - lots of students come here for the water sports.\"</p> <p>Their marketing pushes and bursaries will also be judged not just by bums on seats but whose bums they are - by Offa. Vice-chancellors are almost universally critical of Offa. Whoever is given the job of running Offa is in for a tough ride. There is very little confidence in it:44 vice-chancellors said they thought it would have very little impact; only seven said it might help them in their widening participation policies; and three said it would hinder them. The rest were undecided.</p> <p>A selection of the comments on Offa illustrate this. Ebdon calls it \"a complete red herring \"; Professor Adrian Smith of Queen Mary, University of London, says \"we're all playing in the dark \".Peter Knight, at the University of Central England, says: \"It's another nuisance, a waste of space. We'll write the essay, we'll send the thing off, and really we aren't in Offa's sights - it's the exclusive universities that they are after ... The idea that somebody in the fag end of Whitehall is going to make a positive contribution to this is absolute lunacy. But it was part of the deal so we've had to accept it.\"</p> <p>Even its allies know Offa is in for a rough ride. Steven Schwartz, author of last week's report on university admissions, admits: \"I might be the only person in the country who thinks Offa is a good idea.\"</p> <p>However, there's a subtle distinction within the criticism. The new universities that have the best record on access are dismissive in an off-hand kind of way, while the older universities, which don't, are just critical. University College London is already factoring in the access agreement it will work out with Offa to allow it to charge the top rate of fees. Its provost, Malcolm Grant, says what impact it will have is unclear. \"I have no idea, and nor does it. We haven't got an Offa, we have an absurd timetable for Offa to consider the access agreements that will come from institutions. \"</p> <p>It is ironic that vice-chancellors have turned so hard against Offa when it was the inclusion of Offa which, politically at least, made the top-up fees bill viable. Seen as a sop to Labour MPs during the bill's tricky passage through parliament, it was the device that, for some of them, made up for the effect of top-up fees putting poorer students off going to university.</p> <p>Opinion among the vice-chancellors today is very divided about whether poorer students will be put off going to university post-2006. Although 26 of them said they thought poorer students would be deterred by higher fees, most said it should not put them off. There is widespread support for the funding package, but criticism of how it has been sold. The problem, many vice-chancellors said, is that students don't understand it yet, and the task for selling it lies largely at the door of the DfES.</p> <p>Knight says: \"The responsibility for making that clear rests with the DfES, and they should get their noses to the grindstone now, to make sure that message gets out. \"</p> <p>Levinsky at Plymouth sees it as a short-term problem. \"Most people are getting the message that it is paid off after they graduate. Nobody likes the idea of debt and it will have an effect on them when they start families and buying houses. But the students of today are quite streetwise, and they will realise they won't have to stump up the money. \" Professor Graham Upton at Oxford Brookes says: \"It needs selling right. \"</p> <p>At Sheffield Hallam, Green says there is a difference between the government's and the universities' roles in convincing students to go to university. \"It's both the government's and our job to sell that message. The difference is that while we have a common interest that higher education is a good investment, each institution has to convince students that they are worth the investment. \"</p> <p>So will the students get the bang for their buck? Will the hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on new logos and student bars fill the courses and make their management flush with cash and eager to show off the equivalent of a lottery winner's sports car - the new science facilities, the en-suite halls and pay rises all round? Gloomily, 52 institution heads said that top-up fees wouldn't be enough to secure their financial future. Professor John Turner, deputy vice- chancellor at Surrey, called the contribution top-up fees will make to their budgets \"trivial \".</p> <p>The survey results show that many universities are struggling to get their heads around a market that is, essentially, false. There will be little difference in the prices of the courses; the real variation in the market will be between the bursary schemes the universities adopt and how well they market themselves, not the price tag on the degree. The spending plans the universities are starting to think about - improving student facilities and, to a lesser extent, academic pay - suggest there will be some tangible improvements.</p> <p>But for many institutions the real reward is just a little further away. Only five institutions believe the government will keep the cap at \u00a33, 000 beyond 2010. The overwhelming majority - 46 - said they thought the cap would be raised at the first possible opportunity in 2010, following a promised government review of the limit. A further six institutions thought the government would even break that promise, and do it within three years.</p> <p>UCL's Grant says the raising of the cap \"wouldn't be unwelcome \". Imperial, which famously argued for a much higher rate in the first place, in a response drafted by its press office rather than its rector, Sir Richard Sykes, himself, said it anticipated that the cap would be raised much sooner than that, by 2007.</p> <p>Sterling at Birmingham, who is also the chair of the Russell Group of universities, says there would have been \"more of a market \" had the original proposal for a \u00a35, 000 cap been delivered by the government. \"Even top universities would have to think very carefully about charging that, \" he says.</p> <p>In other institutions the idea of raising the cap causes shivers down the spine. \"We're aware that many universities are champing at the bit - Imperial and the likes, \" says Fidler at Northumbria. \"That worries me greatly. \" It's a fear shared by his colleagues in the new universities. Levinsky at Plymouth says: \"By the next parliament it will be a market economy, it won't last past that. It will be sad, and the start of privatisation of higher education. \"</p> <p>The agonising over the sums, the bursaries and the fees clearly indicates that that is already well under way.</p> <p><strong>EducationGuardian top-up fees survey</strong></p> <p>Results based on interviews with 72 heads of universities and higher education colleges, interviewed by phone on Friday September 10 and Monday September 13.

  "<p>The new Vauxhall VXR Monaro doesn't take any prisoners. It doesn't take many people altogether, in fact, holding two front passengers in butch, hip-hugging rally seats and just about accommodating another pair of grown-ups in crick-necked discomfort in its virtually inaccessible rear cabin. </p> <p>But this isn't a people carrier: it's a \"performance\" coupe and thus, pretty much by definition, only really has in mind the comfort and pleasure of its driver. Coming along for the ride? Then you'd better grab hold of whatever's available and try not to be sick as we storm into the corners. </p> <p>VXR, incidentally, is Vauxhall's new \"performance\" brand - a new badge, ready to be bolted on to a new generation of Vauxhall motors sharing some of the exhaust-pipe know-how from Vauxhall's rather successful sports department. (VX Racing wins a lot of trophies with its souped-up Astra Coupes.) For launch purposes, they've taken the old VX220 - a turbocharged rollerskate aimed at hardcore speed freaks - and redressed it as the VXR 220. </p> <p>And then they've thrown in this new VXR-rated version of the Monaro, which, we learn from the accompanying literature, is aimed at the kind of people who \"get up in the night for a blast, just for the hell of it\". Which, I suppose, distinguishes the Monaro from other, tamer products in the Vauxhall range, which appear to be aimed at the kind of people who get up in the night to go to the bathroom, just because they have to. </p> <p>The car industry, we should be clear, uses the word \"performance\" in a different way from the rest of us. \"Performance\", after all, is not an unreasonable thing to expect from any car. It might even be the first thing you expect from it. We all want our cars to perform and are cross when they don't, so even a bog-standard Vauxhall Corsa should, in an ideal world, be a \"performance\" car. </p> <p>In the car industry's helium-injected version of the word, however, \"performance\" denotes something in excess of mere function. It's a synonym for unusual and possibly even alien levels of speed and power. Also for \"unnecessary\", \"threatening\" and \"a teensy bit silly, really, if we're going to be honest about it\". </p> <p>My Monaro came, appropriately enough, in lad-pleasing, did-you-spill-my-pint? red, had some vaguely medieval, five-spoke alloys, which were as high as an elephant's eye, and was tricked out with more ankle-height skirts than you'll see this side of a Merchant Ivory production. </p> <p>The little marine details were a further giveaway. Check out the shark gills scored into the sidesills. And check out that thick lower lip at the front, hanging open like the mouth of some gruesome fish. It's the kind of car that, on a motorway, suddenly fills your rear-view mirror with its honeycomb grille and stays there until you meekly pull over - a predator, in other words, converting other cars on the road ahead of it into a panicked mass of terrified plankton. </p> <p>Inside, the oil pressure and voltage gauges are mounted high and proud in a binacle above the centre stack, rather than tucked away where they can be safely ignored for the most part, as tends to happen in ordinary, non-performing cars. This is something of a performance motor trait, the underlying assumption being that you will be driving the car at such white-hot intensity that the threat of an electrical storm and, simultaneously, an oil rupture is ever present. Other performance cars achieve the same effect by sporting a prominently mounted, industrial-sized fire extinguisher, though the Monaro passes on this one. </p> <p>To some extent, the interior's silky plastics betray the car's origins at the home of the repmobile. But highly motivated indeed would be the rep who could spend all day, every day at the wheel of the Monaro, with its slippery stick-shift, its unhelpful thirst for petrol and its 5.7 litre V8 engine thundering away under the bonnet and moaning out of the exhaust. </p> <p>Whether the VXR Monaro is in a position to offer its driver the knuckle-whitening thrills and spills and the all-over bodily pleasures that its manufacturer promises was something that I came to doubt in the course of my week thrashing one up and down the A3 and being mean to other drivers in it. It's quick and tuneful and you can fling it around like a fairground ride, but I also found it a bit too cumbersome to be properly racey and a little too softly padded and acoustically enhanced to achieve the nerve-jarring, through-the-seat and up-the-steering column sensations that many petrol-nuts would expect from a performance vehicle. </p> <p>On the bright side, though, it most definitely has a humungous rear wing. It's thick enough that you could snap it off and beat a rhino to death with it, if the circumstances ever arose. Plus it has some sexy circular tail-lights. And it travels so fast in bus lanes that the cameras don't have time to register it. Possibly. Conditions may vary from city to city.</p>",
  "<p>Frequent sufferers of migraines have an increased risk of brain damage, researchers said today. </p> <p>Professor Richard Lipton, from New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said there was evidence that in some people, migraines got worse with time, leaving many severely disabled in their everyday lives. </p> <p>He called on experts in the field to do more to actively target the prevention of migraines rather than simply managing the pain and symptoms. </p> <p>Prof Lipton, speaking at the Migraine Trust international symposium in London, also said that his research had shown that over the course of just one year, 3% of headache sufferers progressed to a point where they had headaches most days. </p> <p>He said these patients with chronic daily headaches were seriously disabled by their attacks.</p> <p>\"In the 1980s we focussed on the migraine attack and thought of it as an episodic disorder, \" said Prof Lipton. </p> <p>\"In the 90s we recognised that migraine interfered with quality of life between attacks and that migraine sufferers had a predisposition to attacks. We came to think of it as a chronic episodic disorder. </p> <p>\"Today we must recognised that a subgroup of migraine sufferers have a progressive disorder with attacks that become more frequent and more disabling over time.\" </p> <p>As well as his own research, Prof Lipton said he had reached this conclusion after work done at Leiden University in the Netherlands. </p> <p>The Dutch researchers found that migraine sufferers were at an increased risk of brain lesions. They also found that the risk of suffering brain lesions increased the more frequent migraine attacks were. </p> <p>The researchers concluded that this raised the possibility that migraine produced progressive changes in the brain. </p> <p>Prof Lipton said his team had identified a number of risk factors for headache progression. </p> <p>He said migraines were more likely to progress than other types of headache. </p> <p>He also said that people with more than four headaches a month, those who were obese and people who took painkillers more than once per week were also particularly likely to experience progressively more attacks. </p> <p>\"The identification of individuals at high risk for headache progression creates opportunities to step in to stop this progressive natural history,\" Prof Lipton added. </p> <p>Up to 15% of people in the UK experience migraines and twice as many women as men are sufferers. </p> <p>Prof Lipton said migraine research was now where heart disease was two decades ago - at the beginning of \"an exciting new era\" where prevention was a real possibility. </p> <p>He said the priority was to identify people with frequent disabling attacks to control and prevent attacks and avoid progression of the disease. </p> <p>Other research being discussed at the meeting, attended by experts from around the world, looked at how imaging of the brain could lead to a better understanding of migraine. </p> <p>Oxford University lecturer Dr Irene Tracey is developing brain imaging techniques which could eventually let doctors \"see\" a patient's pain. </p> <p>It is also hoped that the new method - called functional magnetic resonance imaging - could lead to the development of new migraine therapies which target the right parts of the brain. </p> <p>The researcher used a hot stimulus on the hands of volunteers, and using the equipment was able to see which parts of their brain lit up when they felt pain. </p> <p>\"In our experiments we have seen that the more or less painful something is, the more or less the regions in our brain that process pain signals activate. </p> <p>\"We can see an actual image of the pain someone is experiencing,\" Dr Tracey said. </p> <p>The researcher said when someone described pain it could be very subjective and not related to the reality of the injury, tissue damage or disease.</p>",

  "<p>I would like to dispute the \"legendary\" customer service that First Direct claims to offer in your article of September 18. I became a customer of First Direct as they were the first bank to offer online banking. I ran this account in tandem with my Lloyds TSB account. The time came when Lloyds TSB surpassed First Direct in efficient web access and control of money.</p> <p>I wanted to close my account with First Direct. I had forgotten my security password and was told that I must go to my local HSBC bank to close the account. I was assured I would be able to use a private room to phone First Direct after showing the HSBC manager identification. Upon arriving at the HSBC branch, I was advised that the branch was too small for me to call First Direct privately, but was offered a phone which was on the wall. </p> <p>I told the manager that I needed privacy as I would have to disclose personal information. The guy wasn't very helpful and told me that was all they had to contact First Direct. In the end I managed to badger a First Direct person on the phone into closing my account.

  "<p>French corporate raider Vincent Bollore is to raise his stake in Havas for the second time in a fortnight.</p> <p>But the businessman, who announced last week he had increased his stake in the French advertising group to 10.4%, was vague about his plans for Havas, which has been subject to takeover speculation since Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP Group beat it in the race to buy Grey Global earlier this month. </p> <p>Mr Bollore said he would increase his stake but was not seeking control of the firm at this stage.

  "<p>A plan by BAA to roll a new air control tower down a runway from one part of Heathrow to another in an overnight operation has triggered alarm at Britain's busiest airport. </p> <p>The vast 860 tonne structure is to be loaded on a specially made 64-wheel trolley but critics fear the move will not be completed in time to open the network again by 6am. </p> <p>With six extra tunnels being built to provide links with Terminal 5, pilots and air traffic controllers have also expressed concern that the tower might weigh too much and literally disappear into the ground. </p> <p>There have been previous tunnel problems at Heathrow. Balfour Beatty was fined \u00a31.2m for a collapse 10 years ago which put lives at risk and caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights. It caused a huge crater to appear between the two main runways and damaged buildings. </p> <p>But BAA insists its latest operation - expected to go ahead in November - will not cause any such problems. \"Transportation of the 30-metre high cab has been carefully planned by an expert team and all safety considerations have been taken full account of,\" said a BAA spokesman. </p> <p>\"We have no concerns that the route of the cab's move across Heathrow's airfield is unsafe,\" he added. </p> <p>The procedure has been planned by consultants for more than a year and the operation will be undertaken by the same firm which has already successfully transported large bridge structures across Gatwick and Heathrow, said BAA. \"While the combined weight of the new tower cab and transporter is heavier than a typical jumbo aircraft, the impact on the airfield is substantially less because weight is spread across a significantly larger number of wheels.\" </p> <p>The tower will eventually take over air traffic control for all of Heathrow, including the \u00a34bn extension opening in 2008.</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrats fought off charges last night that their tax-and-spend plans for the coming election would help the middle class more than the poor. <p>Vince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, reinforced his keynote speech to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth with a detailed media briefing paper to explain exactly how he plans to save \u00a35bn a year to fund priority spending. </p> <p>He admitted that a shake-up in Whitehall and the regions could cost even more than the 80,000-plus jobs that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, wants to cut. \"That is an inevitable consequence and we have never sought to hide that,\" he said. </p> <p>Dr Cable's proposals were attacked by both Labour and Tory spokesmen last night. But he stood his ground in insisting that costly items such as the fast-track teacher scheme, costing \u00a3800m over five years, and industrial subsidies - costing 10 times as much - deserve the axe. </p> <p>Mr Brown's Treasury deputy, Paul Boateng, said his figures \"do not add up\" and the Tories said the Lib Dems now had 100 spending pledges and 40 more taxes. Dr Cable insists that he is saving more than he is spending. </p> <p>In the crucial campaign battleground to establish Charles Kennedy's domestic credibility with voters, Dr Cable, a former chief econo mist at Shell, also plans to levy income tax at 50p in the pound on the 270,000 people earning \u00a3100,000 a year - 1% of the working population. </p> <p>That is a gamble. But, repeatedly invoking Mr Brown's mantra of \"financial discipline and tough choices\", Dr Cable recalled the days when he was a political ally of the future chancellor in Scotland of the 70s. </p> <p>\"I never imagined then that after almost eight years of Labour government under his chancellorship that inequality of income and wealth would be as bad or higher than under Mrs Thatcher, the poorest fifth of the population would pay a higher percentage of their income in tax than the richest fifth.\" </p> <p>Dr Cable told reporters that the 50% rate would include the extra 1% the better-off now pay towards the NHS, and that no one would be asked to pay more than 50% - including local income tax with which Lib Dems plan to replace the council tax. Party strategists admit that for the very rich, income tax is virtually voluntary as they negotiate individual packages with the Inland Revenue. </p> <p>Most of the \u00a35bn-\u00a36bn plus the Lib Dems now expect to obtain this way will come from the \u00a31m-a-year super-rich. </p> <p>Dr Cable said yesterday that there was a \"tipping point\" for higher tax rates and that EU experience showed that 50% will not prove counterproductive. </p> <p>Dr Cable and his ex-banker deputy, David Laws, have been pushing their activists further towards free market solutions than many wish to go. </p> <p>Yesterday, Lady (Shirley) Williams used her own speech to warn in stark terms that \"free markets without values and constraints\" fast become a jungle. </p> <p>Relegated to the conference's post-lunch \"graveyard\" slot, Dr Cable mocked the Tories before a half-empty hall. </p> <p>But he insisted that he was trying to return to the traditions of Gladstone's austere Victorian budgets - fairer and simpler taxes, and tight control on spending. </p> <p>\"I suspect the electorate is suffering from miracle fatigue, and shares my scepticism about savings from waste,\" he suggested. </p> <p>The 50% tax rate is earmarked to finance an end to student top-up fees (\u00a31.25bn a year); to provide free personal care for the chronically ill elderly as in Scotland (\u00a32bn a year); and to make council tax fairer as it moves over to local income tax (\u00a32.5bn a year). </p> <p>Some social policy critics argue that such policies benefit the middle classes more effectively than the poor and are shrewd electoral politics rather than redistributing wealth. </p> <p>Lib Dems' saving plans include scrapping Home Office plans for ID cards; cutting back on NHS agency nurses as well as centralised NHS targets and controls; further liberalising of UK defence procurement, opening it to international competition, and cancelling later orders for the Eurofighter. </p> <p>They also want to abolish the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and sell off the Royal Mint to the private sector.</p>",
  "<p>The merger of Capital Radio and GWR is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny if the companies agree terms. </p> <p>Legal experts said competition authorities would look at the combined group's share of audience and radio advertising revenues, measured by region and across the country. </p> <p>Tom Roberts, an associate at media law firm Olswang, said the companies' portfolio of stations in the east Midlands could be a stumbling block. </p> <p>\"There is a potentially problematic overlap in the Midlands with Capital's Century 106FM and GWR's RAM, Trent and Leicester Sound FM.\" </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading would examine a confirmed deal before deciding if it merited referral to the Competition Commission for an in-depth investigation. The OFT could be swayed by Capital's share of the London radio advertising market - some 40% - and both companies' share of national advertising revenues, Mr Roberts said. GWR has a presence in national radio advertising through Classic FM. </p> <p>\"Together with Capital's strong presence in London - with some overlap with Classic FM - and a combined national advertising market share in excess of 40%, this makes an OFT reference to the commission likely, unless divestments are negotiated upfront.\" </p> <p>Radio executives believe competition investigations pose the biggest threat to consolidation. GWR was shocked last year when the regulator blocked its acquisition of a 49% stake in Vibe Radio. The negative verdict on a small radio deal alarmed an industry that presumed low-end acquisitions would not trouble regulators. </p> <p>Vibe's FM licence covered the Severn Estuary area, which spanned Bristol, Bath, Yeovil and Taunton. GWR was a controlling shareholder in a number of stations in the licence area and sold advertising on behalf of another broadcaster in the same franchise. </p> <p>The commission judged the towns in the licence area as separate markets and treated radio advertising as separate from the overall advertising market. </p> <p>It found that GWR would control 85% of the radio advertising market in the Bristol and Bath area if the deal went ahead. It ordered GWR to reduce its stake in Vibe to under 24.9% and banned its sale house from selling advertising on behalf of Vibe. The severity of the ruling forced GWR to unravel the deal and underlined the potential pitfalls of radio consolidation.</p>",
  "<p>The merger discussions between Capital Radio and GWR are the most important development in commercial radio since the introduction of the Communications Act this year. </p> <p>It may prove a pivotal moment for the industry if the talks spur rival operators into merger talks, or attract the predatory interest of American media groups and UK television broadcasters. All these scenarios are possible because of the act and its radical overhaul of radio ownership rules. </p> <p>The most important change was the abolition of the ownership points system, which regulated the number of radio licences a company could control. Before this year, the big groups were up against their points limit and a merger between Capital and GWR was impossible. Competition authorities and very steep share valuations permitting, intra-sector consolidation is now a genuine possibility. </p> <p>The next biggest commercial radio operators outside of Capital and GWR are Emap, with assets including Kiss FM and the Magic network, and Chrysalis Group, owner of Heart 106.2FM in London and the Galaxy network. </p> <p>Emap controls 27.8% of Scottish Radio Holdings, owner of the Clyde 1 and Forth One stations in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and is expected to take full control of the company in a deal that would carry few if any competition concerns because Emap does not have any stations in Scotland. At one stage Emap's acquisition strategy was said to have involved buying SRH and then striking a deal with Chrysalis, but the group has created a new board to oversee its radio plans, and a different approach may emerge over the next year. </p> <p>Gary Hughes, Emap's finance director, yesterday said GWR and Capital were not top of the group's \"wish list\" anyway. The acquisition of SRH is the closest thing to a dead cert in the poker game of consolidation, but Mr Hughes said Emap would not be pressured into a deal by the mooted merger of its rivals. \"We will only go forward at the right time for us and the right price for our shareholders. We will not be rushed into anything,\" he said. </p> <p>Chrysalis has proved its ability with the success of Heart FM in Birmingham and in London, where it is snapping at the heels of Capital FM. Its next move is at the whim of chairman Chris Wright, who owns 26% of the company and might seek to sell his group's book and music publishing divisions as part of any radio deal. </p> <p>A deal with Emap would be subjected to tough regulatory scrutiny. A combined Emap and Chrysalis would control about 45% of the London radio advertising market, with a similar share in the north-east if their Metro and Galaxy stations come together. The act is good for radio in theory but is probably a nightmare for Chrysalis and Emap's competition lawyers. </p> <p>If GWR and Capital merged and Emap bought SRH, they would own just under 70% of the national radio advertising market. That kind of statistic might prompt Chrysalis to act sooner than expected.</p> <p>Super-deals such as a potential Capital and GWR combination will rightly dominate the headlines and investment bankers' intrays over the coming months. But operators on the fringes would also benefit from consolidation, provided they are not caught up in the larger takeovers. This scenario relies on the big players' worst nightmare: the Competition Commission taking a dim view of deals that create a strong position in a local or regional advertising market.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading and the commission might decide that parts of the Capital and GWR deal are not in the spirit of competition law and order the disposal of certain stations. If industry-wide consolidation leads to local or regional franchises being sold on regulators' orders, a new second tier of local operators could come into being as opportunistic groups scoop up forced divestments. </p> <p>Radio executive Richard Wheatly floated the Local Radio Company on Aim earlier this year with such a strategy in mind. \"There is a real possibility of station fallout from this, so we are excited about the implications it has for us. The plan we raised money with was to create a second-tier brand of local radio stations,\" he says. </p> <p>Relaxation of cross-media ownership rules points to possible deals involving national commercial stations Virgin Radio and TalkSPORT. Virgin Radio is owned by SMG, in which ITV has a 17% stake. SMG has repeatedly stated it has no intention of selling Virgin, but the fact that a national TV station can now own a national radio licence at least makes an ITV-Virgin entity theoretically possible. The most interesting combination is BSkyB and the Wireless Group, owner of TalkSPORT. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, which owns 35.4% of the pay-TV group, has 24.5% of the Wireless Group and the cross-promotional opportunities between BSkyB's sports channels and TalkSPORT would be obvious. But the Wireless Group also puts itself in the burgeoning group of unwilling sellers. </p> <p>Lifting the ban on non-EU companies owning a radio station in the UK sparked speculation that Clear Channel, the dominant radio group in the United States, will buy a British broadcaster. Clear Channel executives, however, have no intention of joining the first phase of consolidation by making a bid for Chrysalis or Emap: \"We will watch the consolidation process with fascination,\" the group said yesterday. Clear Channel is expected to wait until the next round, when the landscape is dominated by a merged Capital and GWR or a combined Emap and SRH. </p> <p>Roger Parry, the chief executive of Clear Channel's international operations, has said the sector is too pricey. It remains to be seen whether a super-broadcaster created by the first phase will be attracting the same valuations in several years' time.</p>",
  "<p>Oliver thinks that on the whole he has been a good person. Unfortunately, there is \"just this one little thing\". The \"little thing\" is that he is a paedophile. Since he was a teenager, he has been unable to control his urge to have sex with underage girls - the younger the better: \"I am not dangerous and I've never been violent. I just like young girls.\" </p> <p>David Hines's monologue is not comfortable viewing, but it is a gripping 80 minutes as Oliver sits in his sad, dingy bedsit, waiting for the police to come and rescue him from the baying mob outside. The main reason this doesn't feel merely voyeuristic and grubby is Andrew C Wadsworth's remarkable performance as a man who knows he has ruined his own life by his sexual obsession but is totally unable to accept that he has ruined the lives of his victims. His very ordinariness and apparent unassuming niceness make you shiver; he is so plausible that you might indeed be persuaded to entrust your daughters to him. </p> <p>Other plays, such as The Sugar Syndrome and Frozen, have got inside the mind of the paedophile with greater complexity. However, Hines's piece is strikingly effective in the way it almost makes you sympathise with its protagonist. You nearly start believing Oliver's self-justifications; you find yourself manipulated by this man who has spent a lifetime inventing clever ways to entice young girls away with him without attracting the attention of the police. </p> <p>Hines's script is not pleasant.

  "<p>Returning to a play you adored five years ago is like meeting up with an old lover. Will you recognise each other? Will sparks still fly? Will new circumstances change everything? </p> <p>When Mark Thomson's hostage drama played at Musselburgh's Brunton Theatre in 1999, it was seen by so few people that my enthusiasm for it felt like a delusion. Now, revived at the Lyceum to open Thomson's second season as artistic director, A Madman Sings to the Moon proves to be so much more than a heat- of-the-moment thing. </p> <p>The only difference is that this brilliant play has found the big, confident, public voice it deserved all those years ago. That's because, unlike a lot of work that is lauded by the critics but seen by few, it is a generous, accessible piece of drama with broad popular appeal. While there is a very funny script and a simple premise - man enters cafe with gun and holds customers hostage - Thomson also has something of importance to say. </p> <p>His political purpose is similar to that of 7:84's current show, Private Agenda, a verbatim collage of angry voices from the frontline of Scotland's public services, where the public finance initiative has turned colleagues into competitors. Movingly dramatising the same idea, Thomson argues that such economic pressures force us to define ourselves by our jobs, status and possessions, instead of by our human relationships. We forget how to talk to each other and people get hurt. </p> <p>The damaged person in question is Kenny Wright, a social misfit desperate for stability in a volatile world.

  "Tony Blair has agreed to scrap most of the fees levied for making use of the Freedom of Information Act, as part of an effort to regain disillusioned liberal voters at the election. <p>He told a cabinet meeting devoted to party issues last week that Labour was losing votes, not just those of disillusioned working class families but also of the middle class, especially women, many of whom oppose the war in Iraq. </p> <p>It is the first time in many years that Mr Blair has acknowledged in private that the Liberal Democrats win more than a temporary protest vote. </p> <p>It is expected that Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs secretary, will announce that charges for applications for information under the Freedom of Information Act will not be levied so long as the cost of gathering the information does not exceed \u00a3600. </p> <p>That it the ceiling at which parliamentary questions are not answered, on the grounds of disproportionate cost. </p> <p>The act comes into force next year and the Information Commissioner has been pressing for minimal charges. Ministers believe the government has not had enough political credit for introducing the law and has been bogged down by lobbyists demanding wider freedoms. </p> <p>Lord Falconer is eager that the fact of the act, a long standing demand of the civil liberties left, is not lost in the argument that only professional groups will be able to afford to use it. </p> <p>The cost of gathering information will often depend on the complexity of the analysis required by civil servants, since much raw information is available for publication at the touch of a computer button. </p> <p>Writing in the Guardian the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, has made a fresh effort to crystallise Labour's attack on Charles Kennedy's politics, insisting that his party is moving to the right. </p> <p>He says: \"As the Tories have lurched further to the right, the Liberal Democrats have set up camp in the space they have vacated. </p> <p>\"Charles Kennedy says they are neither left nor right. Actually they are seeking to be both, lurching to the right in policy while using Iraq to maintain a leftwing appeal.\" </p> <p>Labour's concern about women voters is reflected in the decision of the industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, to emphasise plans for family-friendly measures, such as longer time off for mothers. </p> <p>The meeting was also told that Labour's private polling shows that many voters in the social catagories D and E still did not believe the government had done enough to tackle its core issues of anti-social behaviour, asylum and Europe. </p> <p>But Mr Blair now recognises that he needs to balance these demands with the threat of alienating the politically liberal vote. </p> <p>He is also seeking ways to refashion his unpopular inter nationalism by trying to shift the focus from Iraq to his plans for Africa and new initiatives on climate change. </p> <p>He is due to visit Africa soon, even though he has insisted that his focus from now until the election will be on domestic issues. </p> <p>Labour's national executive discussed motions for the party conference yesterday, and it is likely that those backing the withdrawal of troops from Iraq will not make the conference floor. </p> <p>It is also unlikely there will be divisive votes on whether 16- and 17-year-olds should be given the vote, a policy rejected by the Electoral Commission, and whether there should be a mainly elected House of Lords: two minority positions adopted by the Labour policy forum in 2003. </p> <p>The option for the Lords favoured by ministers is an 80% indirectly elected, 20% appointed chamber.

  "<p>Britain is throwing out more than a million tonnes of electronic \"e-waste\" such as broken computer monitors and discarded mobile phones every year, and new government figures show that more than ever is going abroad. </p> <p>Last year, 23,000 tonnes of IT and other electronic equipment was shipped out illegally, mostly to China, west Africa, Pakistan and India.</p> <p>In one case, the documents on a container waiting to be shipped from Felixstowe to Pakistan declared that its contents were innocuous plastic packaging. But when customs officers opened it up they found tonnes of broken computer monitors and other electronic waste collected by a south Wales company which was sending it to Lahore to be dismantled by hand for its lead and other valuable toxic contents. The illegal shipment of hazardous waste was blocked and returned.</p> <p>The government's pollution watchdog, the Environment Agency, says the e-waste exports are worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Last year such waste involved tens of thousands of old computers, 500,000 television sets, 3m refrigerators, 160,000 tonnes of other electrical equipment and millions of discarded mobile phones, all sent to the poorest countries in the world.</p> <p>But the agency admits it has no idea how much of the waste is being deliberately dumped on poor countries by companies trying to avoid paying increasingly high disposal costs in the UK, and how much is only technically illegal because companies have filled in the forms incorrectly.</p> <p>\"It is not necessarily all illegal,\" said an agency spokesman. \"There is a legitimate international trade in goods, with an overseas market for usable equipment such as computers and TVs. Further work will help us to find out how much is illegal. Our investigations suggest some exporters are not seeking the appropriate legal authorisation.\"</p> <p>However, two reports not re leased by the Environment Agency but seen by the Guardian suggest the problem is far greater than the government wants to admit.</p> <p>One, by the Industry Council for Electronic Equipment Recycling (Icer), is based on confidential interviews with businesses and concludes that most computer exports are certainly waste because the goods are neither tested nor repaired before export.</p> <p>Another, by Impel, a grouping of six European countries' environment agencies including Britain's, says that exporters are finding new ways of bypassing the rules and that governments have neither the resources nor the will to give any priority to checking what leaves the country.</p> <p>\"Priorities for enforcement are low, and as a consequence only little or no capacity is reserved for enforcement _ Follow-up actions cannot be carried out. Enforcement of legislation is absolutely needed,\" say the report's authors.</p> <p>Impel's ongoing study of six major European ports, including Felixstowe, has found that 22% of all the waste exports checked for more than a year were illegal. Enforcement agencies in the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Poland and elsewhere found large quantities of computer equipment, electrical cable, cathode ray tubes, single-use cameras, old tyres, and oil and contaminated motor parts being exported.</p> <p>In many cases the authorities had to let the shipment go because they could not tell what equipment was reusable or what was obsolete.</p> <p>Many of the containers inspected showed misleading information about their contents and origin, and the report suggested scrap exporters were trying to confuse the authorities. One tactic, it noted, was to \"port hop\" - send waste from one European des tination to another, leaving a trail of documents which are impossible to check. A shipment of British single-use cameras complete with batteries was sent to Germany, where it was twice repacked before being shipped to China for \"recycling\".</p> <p>China and India, thought to be the target of most e-waste exports, have urged Britain and other rich countries through the UN and other international forums to stop exporting hazardous waste because they do not have the facilities to inspect all the traffic being sent.</p> <p>EU environment agencies agree. \"No one can pretend that port authorities in India or Asia are not immune from corruption and abuse. It is far more difficult to carry out inspections at the port of destination,\" says the Impel report.</p> <p>The scale of the trade and the damage it is doing is becoming clear. A major investigation by an international coalition of environmental groups this year found huge quantities of e-waste being exported to China, Pakistan and India, where it was being reprocessed in operations extremely harmful to both human health and the environment.</p> <p>The groups, including Basel Action Network (Ban), Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Toxics Link India and Greenpeace, found e-waste mixed with scrap metal from Japan, South Korea, the US and the EU, and identified a town called Guiyu, some 200 miles north-east of Hong Kong in the coastal province of Guangdong, where up to 100,000 migrant labourers break up and reprocess obsolete computers from around the world.</p> <p>The work involves men, women and children unaware of the health and environmental hazards of dismantling such goods - processes that include the open burning of plastics and wires, the use of acid to extract gold, the melting and burning of toxic soldered circuit boards and the cracking and dumping of toxic lead-laden cathode ray tubes.</p> <p>Already Guiyu has become so polluted that well water is undrinkable and water has to be trucked in for the entire population, the report said.</p> <p>\"We found a cyber-age nightmare,\" said Jim Puckett of Ban. \"They call this recycling, but it's really dumping by another name. Yet to our horror, we discovered that rather than banning it, governments are actually encouraging this ugly trade in order to avoid finding real solutions to the massive tide of obsolete computer waste generated.\"</p> <p>The groups appealed to global manufacturers to take responsibility for their electronic products and phase out the dangerous substances found within them.</p> <p>\"It is ironic that these elec tronic discards are being collected in industrialised countries for the purpose of dumping them in poor countries. Asia is the dustbin of the world's hazardous waste,\" said Von Hernandez of Greenpeace International.</p> <p>Exports of e-waste are likely to rise sharply in the next few years as European laws covering electrical and electronic goods insist that scrap is recycled and barred from being burned in incinerators.</p> <p>\"People want the latest electronic gadgets, but they come at a price,\" said Claire Wilton of Friends of the Earth. \"Computers and televisions contain toxic materials. It's the responsibility of manufacturers to design goods, computers and DVD players that are re-usable and recyclable.\"</p>",
  "The video posted last night showing the beheading of the American hostage Eugene Armstrong is the latest example of the ruthlessness of the Iraqi militant group responsible. <p>Six months ago, Tawhid and Jihad (Unification and Holy War) was just one of numerous militant groups operating in the chaos of Iraq. But in recent weeks, as the insurgency has spiralled out of control, the group has established itself as the most sophisticated and brutal in the country. </p> <p>Mr Armstrong and his colleagues Jack Hensley and Briton Kenneth Bigley were seized last week in a carefully planned operation that had all the hallmarks of Tawhid and Jihad. The three westerners had been living in an anonymous two-storey house in Mansour, an affluent suburb of Baghdad which is home to foreign embassies and Iraqi politicians. </p> <p>Gunmen from the group had clearly been tipped off about the men. On Thursday morning, they pulled up outside the house in an unmarked minivan and another car. At 6am the power in the street failed, and two of the westerners wandered out of their unguarded compound to start their generator. The gunmen grabbed them, bundled all three into their minivan and drove off. </p> <p>By the time the Iraqi police arrived at 7am they had van ished, possibly into a safe house in Baghdad, but more probably to Falluja, the centre of Iraq's flourishing kidnapping industry and a stronghold of Iraq's resistance. </p> <p>The US claims that Tawhid and Jihad is masterminded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant apparently responsible for numerous terrorist and suicide attacks in Iraq. It also claims that Mr Zarqawi is allied to al-Qaida. </p> <p>Such links have not been proven. But there is little doubt that Tawhid and Jihad includes not just Iraqi insurgents but foreign Arab fighters, who have flooded into Falluja since the US withdrew from the town in April after a three-week siege. </p> <p>Iraq's resistance currently appears to be split into two main camps - old-fashioned Iraqi nationalists who are concentrating their efforts on fighting Americans and dislike the idea of killing fellow Iraqis; and newer, more radical groups such as Tawhid and Jihad who believe in targeting anyone who collaborates with the US occupation, including the Iraqi police, government officials and provincial governors. </p> <p>The second group appears to be better funded. It is more organised. It has superior intelligence. It is more professional. And it is more deadly. </p> <p>Its uncompromising message also appears to be gaining in popularity - at least among Iraqis already hostile to the Americans and Iraq's interim government. When insurgents destroyed an American Bradley fighting vehicle in Baghdad's Haifa Street, the scene of heavy fighting this month between US forces and Sunni militants, they placed the black flag of Tawhid and Jihad in the vehicle's smouldering gun barrel. </p> <p>Last night's video showed Mr Armstrong in an orange jumpsuit - worn by prisoners held by the Bush administration in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The symbolism is not a coincidence. </p> <p>The group's demand that all female Iraqi prisoners be freed from US jails in Iraq appears to be not a real demand but an attempt to exploit an issue that has incensed ordinary Iraqis. </p> <p>The US has already released all but two female prisoners from its jails in Iraq but it continues to hold around 5,000 male detainees in Abu Ghraib and Umm Qasr, a US prison near British-occupied Basra. Few of the prisoners have been charged; all of them have been locked up without trial, some for more than a year. </p> <p>Many of the detainees are from Iraq's Sunni heartland where support for groups such as Tawhid and Jihad is growing. </p> <p>Hope for Mr Bigley and Mr Hensley has been fading. Their only chance of escape is if the American authorities receive a last-minute tip-off as to where they are being held - highly unlikely in a shadowy world where anyone suspected of being an American spy suffers the same gruesome fate as the western hostages. </p> <p>One of the best-selling CDs in Baghdad's market shows an Egyptian accused of working for the Americans having his head sawn off in a scruffy backyard. </p> <p>The CD is professionally produced, using the latest technology. </p> <p>These are grim times for Iraq, and for the few remaining westerners in Baghdad.</p>",
  "<p>Angela Cannings' case marked a milestone in the history of miscarriages of justice. Overturning her conviction for murdering her two baby sons, Lord Justice Judge, the deputy chief justice, declared that no parent should ever again face prosecution for killing a child if there was serious disagreement between reputable experts about the cause of death and no other cogent evidence. </p> <p>But nine months after Cannings was freed, and in the wake of the cases of Sally Clark and Trupti Patel, both ultimately cleared of killing their babies, there are serious worries that the fallout may be putting children at risk. Doctors' fears that they could suffer the same fate as the paediatrician Sir Roy Meadow, a prosecution witness in all three cases, and the pathologist Alan Williams, who carried out the postmortems on Clark's two sons - both vilified in the media and facing charges of serious professional misconduct at the General Medical Council - are causing them to think again about giving evidence in child abuse cases. </p> <p>England's top family judge, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, and other senior judges have held crisis meetings with the chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, and the heads of the royal colleges for paediatricians and pathologists. A bulletin from her office in the latest newsletter for family law barristers says the judgment in the Cannings case is causing her \"acute concern\". </p> <p>The judgment has reverberated through the criminal courts, where appeals could now be brought by more than 30 parents whose convictions have been found to be questionable after the attorney general ordered a review of 297 cases over the past 10 years. In the family courts where Dame Elizabeth presides as head of the high court's family division, however - contrary to media expectations - there has been no flood of applications to re-open cases where children were allegedly wrongly taken into care on disputed medical evidence. Press stories initially predicted that up to 5,000 care cases could be reviewed. Then the children's minister Margaret Hodge put it at \"no more than than the low hundreds.\" The truth is that appeals filed with the courts amount to \"only a very small handful\", Dame Elizabeth's office reveals. But the effect of the Cannings case has been \"keenly felt at a broader level, in terms of the detrimental impact it has had on the willingness of expert witnesses to risk participating in child injury cases,\" the bulletin adds. </p> <p>Professor Alan Craft, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, confirms: \"Solicitors are having enormous difficulty [in finding experts] and the college is rung up on a daily basis by solicitors saying 'Can you provide us with an expert?' A lot of people who were doing expert witness work have said, 'It's not worth the candle, I'm not going to end up being pilloried or referred to the GMC or being the subject of a campaign on a website. It's just not worth it.' The problem is that children will suffer then because if there is nobody to do the expert witness work, these cases will not be taken forward and children will not be protected.\" </p> <p>For paediatrician Chris Hobbs, the case of Dr Ruby Schwartz, who had misconduct charges against her dropped by the GMC this month, reinforces the message that failing to spot child abuse is less risky professionally than raising concerns. He contrasts the opprobrium heaped on Meadow with the limited media coverage given Schwartz, the consultant paediatrician whose failure to diagnose that Victoria Climbie was being brutally abused led to the eight-year-old's return to the carers who were eventually to kill her, in one of the UK's worst child abuse cases. </p> <p>\"The professionals have got their backs to the wall. It's very difficult now for them to come out and say when they're concerned,\" says Hobbs. \"That means going to court and I think people are just increasingly anxious about that, and much more likely to back off and take a softly, softly approach, rather than have to deal with the difficult issues. They're very frightened that they're going to be attacked and their professional position put under threat.\" </p> <p>Hobbs, a consultant at St James's Hospital, Leeds, has cut back on his own forays into court. \"I've thought much more carefully about expert witness work because you're looking for the ambush. I'm very much more cautious and wary and I want to know the ins and outs of the case.\" </p> <p>Another factor, he points out, is that paediatricians, who already have a heavy NHS workload, usually have to squeeze their court work into evenings and weekends. NHS trusts \"quite rightly say 'We want our money's worth out of our employees'.\" </p> <p>Retired paediatricians such as Meadow are more readily available, but there is a move - rightly, says Hobbs - towards insisting on recent clinical experience. \"I reckon two years after retirement is about as long as you can go - you're out of date then.\" Fewer paediatricians are going into child protection work anyway and \"a lot of people going into it want to do it as a bit of their work; very few people are prepared to take it as a major part. So you don't become an expert then.\" </p> <p>The Labour peer and criminal QC Helena Kennedy, who chaired a working group on sudden infant deaths which reported this month, believes implementation of her report would go a long way towards calming doctors' fears. The group, set up by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health together with the Royal College of Pathologists, recommends a national protocol for unexpected baby deaths which would see all postmortems performed by pathologists with paediatric training and a careful joint investigation by doctors and police. Witnesses would be vetted by judges for their expertise in the area in question, and experts in criminal cases would meet for a pre-trial review, as they do now in child care cases in the family courts, to thrash out their areas of agreement and disagreement. </p> <p>The royal colleges plan to set up training programmes for expert witnesses, and judges would check whether a prospective witness had been trained to give objective evidence. Kennedy argues that all of this would make for greater certainty and instil more confidence into expert witnesses. \"We're at a high water mark at the moment of people feeling alarmed, as always happens with miscarriages of justice. It will start seeping back in the other direction, particularly once people have the area of certainty that can be created by having proper ground rules. </p> <p>\"That's why having a really good protocol is so important, and also having good training. Up until now there has been no training. People were propelled into the courts with their function [assumed to be] just telling folk what you thought. But evidence has to be scientifically based. It's not about a feeling in your water.\" </p> <p>Kennedy, who has defended mothers accused of murdering their babies and has no doubt that some mothers do kill their children, blames the media in part for the shortage of experts willing to put their reputations on the line in court. \"These are people who are choosing this because it's a vocation and they should be getting public support. We do expect high professional standards and we also should challenge hubris when we see it, but at the same time we should recognise the important role that these doctors are playing. </p> <p>\"Doing this work and meeting with large numbers of pathologists and paediatricians, what one realises is here are thoroughly decent professionals who, in the vast majority of cases, are seeking to do their best. A small number get it wrong and the price is paid by everybody. </p> <p>\"The public have to decide what they want. They're going to drive people out if they're not careful.\"</p>",
  "<p>Billions of pounds, enough to pay for the entire primary health and education needs of the world's developing countries, are being siphoned off through offshore companies and tax havens, according to a body formed to expose the offenders. </p> <p>Aid organisations are alarmed that money which should be used for building the infrastructure of the poorest countries is being hidden in havens by corrupt politicians and multinationals exploiting tax loopholes. Offshore companies are being formed at the rate of about 150,000 a year. While in the 70s there were just 25 tax havens, there are at least 63 now, about half of them British protectorates or former colonies. Tax avoidance in Britain alone is estimated at between \u00a325bn and \u00a385bn. </p> <p>This month the Tax Justice Network, which was formed last year by tax experts and economists worried about the trend, launched an international secretariat in London. It will work with the UN and other international bodies to reverse the practice of hiding money from governments worldwide. </p> <p>John Christensen, coordinator of the secretariat, said: \"Many developing countries are now dominated by elites that are involved in tax havens. Things have actually got worse in the last few years.\" As new havens are formed, existing ones offer better deals. </p> <p>Mr Christensen, a former economic adviser to the Jersey government who has also worked at the then Department of Overseas Development and with Oxfam, said many of the havens were now \"locked in a desperate competition. They like to suggest that they oil the wheels of global capital but there is no case for that. What has happened is that tax havens transfer the burden of tax away from capital and towards labour and the consumer.\" </p> <p>He also believes that the attraction of making money by putting it in offshore havens damaged British industry because money which could have been invested in Britain had been removed from the country. </p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has also expressed concern that money which should be spent on developing countries is being moved offshore. </p> <p>A UN spokesman confirmed yesterday that Mr Annan saw the issue as a priority. \"The secretary general has indicated repeatedly that he believes money should be spent on development rather than going offshore,\" he said. </p> <p>The secretariat believes the UN has a vital role to play in tracking the money. \"The remedies have to be global and the UN is the only body able to do it,\" said Mr Christensen. \"The WTO [World Trade Organisation] has failed.\" </p> <p>Tax havens have also attracted the attention of John Kerry, the US Democratic party's presidential candidate, who has indicated that if elected he will pursue the companies that hide their profits abroad. In April, the US general accounting office said 61% of US corporations paid no federal income tax in the late 90s. Tax havens contain only 1.2% of the world's population and 3% of the world's GDP, but 26% of assets and 31% of the profits of US multinationals are held there. </p> <p><strong>Global phenomena</strong></p> <p>Almost every part of the world now has access to havens. Europeans can use the old-established ones such as Jersey and Liechtenstein or the newer ones, like Cyprus and Malta; the Asian Pacific has the Pacific islands and Singapore; India and southern Africa have the Seychelles and Mauritius; and North America has the Caribbean islands and Central America. </p> <p>While a number of havens, such as the Cayman islands and Bermuda, have improved regulations, the effect of this has been, in the view of Mr Christensen, to legitimise them. \"Merely chasing out the worst havens and setting international standards for the better ones does little to address the real problems,\" he said. </p> <p>The list of political figures who have availed themselves of the system includes Haiti's \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, Zaire's President Mobutu, Sani Abacha, the former president of Nigeria, and Raul Salinas, the brother of the former Mexican president. Mr Abacha, during his period as president, had a standing order to transfer $15m (\u00a38.4m at current exchange rates) a day of stolen funds to his Swiss bank account. Much of this money has been lost forever to the countries concerned although some has been traced; the current president of Nigeria recently visited Jersey to thank the authorities there for tracking down the millions that Mr Abacha had hidden. </p> <p>In 1999, the Economist estimated that African leaders had $20bn in Swiss bank accounts alone, twice the amount that sub-Saharan Africa spends on servicing debts. </p> <p>Among the latest countries offering such services is Somalia, which Mr Christensen describes as \"an example of what can happen when the cancer is not cut out\". He believes that the main function of the financial markets in Somalia will be money laundering. </p> <p>Tax avoidance also breeds other unethical habits: when Enron was investigated in 2001, it emerged it had 881 offshore subsidiaries, 692 incorporated in the Cayman islands. The change has been assisted by technological change in communication and the liberalisation of the marketplace. </p> <p>Many major charities are also concerned about the situation. \"The implications of tax avoidance on development are manifold,\" said Tim Peat, economic justice campaigner at War on Want. \"While transnational corporations endeavour to hold on to cash by shoring it up in tax havens, millions are lost that could have been used in the fight against poverty. </p> <p>\"Every time we investigate corruption in the oil industry, we find that looted public money has been laundered through offshore tax havens,\" said Gavin Hayman of Global Witness, the international resource watchdog group. </p> <p>\"Billions of dollars pass from public to private hands this way with no comeback. The collateral damage to the licit international system and to international development is truly enormous and the only people who benefit are those who have something bad to hide. Tax havens are the seedy backstreet bars of the financial world, where corporations and multi-millionaires huddle in shadowy corners to pursue their business out of sight of respectable citizens.\" </p> <p><strong>Instability</strong></p> <p>The latest Oxfam report on tax havens, on which Mr Christensen worked, suggested the amount secreted in tax havens was equivalent to six times the estimated annual cost of universal primary education and almost three times the cost of universal primary health. </p> <p>He said that offshore centres undermined economies in three ways: the capacity of countries to raise tax revenue was limited, thus restricting a poor country's ability to finance investments in health and education; secondly, the offshore system provided a safe haven for money laundering, illicit arms dealing and diamond trafficking; thirdly, the offshore system contributed to financial instability which led to the crises in the Indonesian and Thai economies in 90s. </p> <p>His colleague Sony Kapoor, the secretariat's economic adviser, agreed: \"Tax evasion and tax avoidance on a large scale is inhibiting development in poor countries and eroding the existing welfare state in the rich states.\" </p> <p>A variety of international organisations are now attempting to address the problem in differing ways. They include the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the EU, the UN drugs control programme and the Financial Action Task Force, which was set up by the G7 countries. Charities and churches across Europe, particularly in France, are also becoming more involved. </p> <p>Richard Murphy, of Tax Research, which works closely with the new organisation, said it was important that the wealthier countries were seen not to be dictating terms to poorer countries. </p> <p>\"You cannot dictate to nation states their level of taxes,\" he said, \"but you can require that they only tax what is theirs to tax.\" </p> <p>The notion of tax havens goes back to just after the Napoleonic wars when demobbed officers moved to Jersey, but it was not until the 1960s that the high rates of British taxation acted as a motivation for people to move their money abroad. </p> <p>Allowing British protectorates or former colonies to set themselves up as tax havens was also an attractive proposition for Britain in that it allowed those places to become self-sufficient. Now the whole process has accelerated to the extent that billions of pounds are being removed from the very countries that need them most.</p>",
  "Evidence that antidepressant drugs like Seroxat and Prozac could make people homicidal is being ignored by the body responsible for regulating medicines in the UK, a leading expert said yesterday. <p>The charge came from David Healy, an expert on psychiatric drugs from north Wales whose warnings that the drugs could cause suicide prompted a major inquiry. That investigation, by an expert working group of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority, led to the entire class of drugs except Prozac being banned last year from use in children. </p> <p>The expert working group has gone on to look at suicides in adults taking any of the drugs known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). But Dr Healy says that they are overlooking very important data relating to a set of further dangerous side-effects. </p> <p>Dr Healy, director of the north Wales department of psychological medicine, says he has seen data from the clinical trials that show even some healthy volunteers - people with no illness at all volunteering to take part in the earliest safety trials of the drugs - became unaccountably aggressive. Their reaction is coded as \"hostile\" which can include homicidal behaviour and serious aggression. </p> <p>\"I think there is very clear evidence for all of the SSRI group of drugs that in addition to making people suicidal, they can make people homicidal or seriously aggressive and the data have been sitting in the MHRA's files on this issue,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It is there for children across a range of different problems, it is there for healthy volunteers and a range of adults and the MHRA has paid no heed to this.\" </p> <p>The healthy volunteer trials of the British drug Seroxat took place in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Of the 271 fit and well individuals, three became hostile, compared with none on an inactive placebo - a rate of 1.1%, which although small could translate to very many cases among the 50m worldwide who have taken Seroxat over the last 15 years. </p> <p>The signal from the healthy volunteer trials is supported by data from trials in children on Seroxat for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and social phobia. Children taking part amounted to 738 on Seroxat and 647 on placebo. Of those, there were 27 hostile events on Seroxat and only four on placebo. Taking the children with OCD alone, those on the drug were 17 times more likely to become aggressive than those on placebo. </p> <p>Trials of Seroxat (known generically as paroxetine) for women with pre-menstrual syndrome show a similar pattern, with five hostile acts on the drug and none on placebo. </p> <p>But, says Dr Healy, the MHRA officials appear not to have picked up the signals from all the separate trials and are failing to see the whole picture. </p> <p>A number of cases where people have argued their aggressive acts were due to one of the SSRI antidepressants have come to court. In the most dramatic, a US jury in 2001 found that GlaxoSmithKline's drug was partly responsible for the murders committed by Donald Schell. After two days on Paxil (as Seroxat is named in the USA), Schell killed his wife, his daughter and his baby granddaughter before shooting himself dead. GlaxoSmithKline was ordered to pay $8m (\u00a34.5m) to the remaining family members. </p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline last night denied that its drug caused adults to become hostile, although it acknowledged there had been a problem in the children's trials. \"There is no compelling evidence from our clinical trials that Seroxat causes hostile behaviour in adults. When you put the results from all the clinical trials together there is no difference between the rates of hostility for adult patients taking Seroxat and the patients taking placebo, or dummy pill. This data has been shared with regulators including the MHRA,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>The MHRA said yesterday that the working group had looked at the data on events coded as \"hostility\" in its analysis of the children's trials and that it had acted to prevent the use of most SSRIs in children as a result of all the data, including that on hostility. \"The review of adult data is ongoing,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's report from the new Sentencing Guidelines Council - the first in a five-year exercise - should be celebrated. The council already knows it can expect controversy, with a leak to the Sunday Times slashed across the front page under the misleading headline: \"Murderers to be freed after seven years.\" The aim of the council, which will set the rate for over 2,000 offences, is to promote a more rational sentencing system. Never has it been more urgently needed. Huge variations exist between different courts, but the trend is all in one direction: more custody. Where it took four decades up to 1991 for the prison population to rise by 11,000, the rise since then has been 25,000, more than double in a decade. Yet this has coincided with the most sustained crime drop for 100 years with both burglary and car crime reduced by a third. </p> <p>Yesterday's report tackled an issue that affects all 2,000 offences: guidelines on the reduction in sentences for pleading guilty. This is not a new concept but the draft guidelines seek more consistency by setting out a sliding rule that begins with a 10% reduction for a late plea at the door of the court, when much of the work of the police and prosecutors will have already been made, to up to 33% for an early guilty plea. The earlier the plea the earlier victims and other witnesses are reassured that they will not have to undergo the trauma of giving evidence. In exceptional circumstances, the reduction in sentence could be even higher than one-third if an offender turns himself in after committing a crime or goes to the police in an old and forgotten case where there is no evidence. Under this procedure, the tariff could be cut to less than seven years, as it is now for mercy killers. </p> <p>David Davies, the shadow home secretary, has already expressed opposition to the council. He told the Sunday Times: \"The dramatic reduction of the minimum sentence for murder makes a mockery of David Blunkett's claims to be tough on serious crime.\" The home secretary should be embarrassed having divided murder into three categories with tough populist minimum sentences - 15 years, 30 years, and \"whole life\". But in reality the 15 years, thankfully, does mean people who help relatives with incurable and excruciatingly painful diseases to die, can receive a much lower tariff. Most opinion polls suggest the public opposes custody in these cases. Here is an opportunity for Mr Blunkett to set up a comprehensive review of murder, which the Law Commission, the government's legal advisers, called for last month but the home secretary rejected.</p>",
  "Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, yesterday contradicted Tony Blair's claim that there was a new conflict inside Iraq and dismissed fears of a civil war. <p>Speaking in London before flying to Washington, Mr Allawi told a small group of editors: \"It's not a second war, as such. It's a big conflict, with people coming to Iraq from various parts - including the European Union, the Middle East and Pakistan - to fight. </p> <p>\"I'm surprised at people who call it a civil war. If that was going to happen it would have happened six months ago. Yes, there is tension between Shia and Sunni, and between Arab and Kurd, but it doesn't amount to even a precursor to civil war. </p> <p>\"The insurgents are a small minority, and the media are feeding on this. I rule out entirely this notion that Iraq is slipping into a civil war. There are ongoing attacks, of course, and they are becoming deadlier, but they are decreasing.\" </p> <p>Mr Allawi said the insurgents broke down into three groups: people used by Saddam Hussein to kill people over decades; foreigners who found it easy to enter Iraq through lack of border controls; and ordinary criminals. </p> <p>Mr Allawi's apparent rebuke to the prime minister comes after one of the bloodiest weeks in Iraq since last year's invasion. </p> <p>More than 300 people have been killed, fierce fighting has broken out in the heart of Baghdad and the latest western hostages - two Americans and a Briton - face execution. </p> <p>US forces and Mr Allawi's beleaguered interim government have lost control of large areas of the country, including most of the Sunni heartland, and the towns of Falluja and Ramadi. </p> <p>Sunni fundamentalist militias are waging an increasingly sophisticated campaign against anyone they suspect of collaborating with the Americans - police officers, local governors, and Iraqi government officials. </p> <p>Last week some 47 people were killed and 119 injured when a car bomb exploded outside a police station near Baghdad's Haifa Street in the deadliest single attack in Iraq for six months. </p> <p>Baghdad's dwindling community of foreigners, meanwhile, have moved into hotels protected by armed guards and blast walls because of the ever-present risk of kidnapping. Over the weekend the Foreign Office urged Britons not to travel to Iraq. </p> <p>Mr Allawi, meanwhile, owes his continuing survival to a huge team of American bodyguards who follow him everywhere. He told al-Hayat, an Arabic newspaper based in London, that he has been targeted four times since taking office on June 28. </p> <p>In the most recent foiled attack, his bodyguards spotted a strange car just outside the Baghdad area where ministries are located. The car exploded and an ensuing clash between his bodyguards and armed men resulted in the arrest of \"two Arabs\" he described as Muslim extremists. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian who has been linked to al-Qaida, has claimed responsibility for more than one assassination attempt against Mr Allawi and has vowed to continue. </p> <p>Mr Allawi said yesterday that he hoped that trials of Saddam's former associates would begin in October, with the aim of putting Saddam on trial in November or December. He hoped the trial would be over before the elections in January. Mr Allawi said he was determined to press ahead with the elections, at which he hoped for a turnout of 55-60%.</p>",
  "One of the 13 detainees interned for nearly three years as suspected international terrorists was released yesterday from a high security prison by the home secretary, David Blunkett, without any detailed explanation being offered. <p>The release of the Algerian national, identified only as D, comes just three months after he was said by a special judicial commission to have a \"long history of involvement in terrorist support activity\" and the ability and commitment to resume that work were he at liberty in Britain. </p> <p>His solicitor, Natalie Garcia, said last night she had broken the news to him: \"He was absolutely choked. All he could say was 'I don't understand'. He feels he's been locked up for three years just on a whim.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett in a statement to MPs said yesterday he had made the decision because \"the weight of evidence\" no longer justified D's continued detention and he was revoking the certificate branding him a suspected international terrorist. A Home Office spokeswoman would not elaborate on the reasons for the decision other than saying that the decision was made ahead of the second statutory review of his case. She added that the home secretary had always promised to act on new information or a change in circumstances. </p> <p>The Algerian man walked free from Woodhill high security prison near Milton Keynes yesterday afternoon and has been given \"discretionary leave to stay\" in the country for six months with \"a range of assistance\" from the national asylum support service. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett told MPs yesterday: \"In revoking D's certificate I have made clear that any further activities that are assessed to be a threat to national security could lead to him being certified again.\" </p> <p>The decision mystified human rights campaigners who said it raised questions over the accuracy of the intelligence used to detain him. </p> <p>The Algerian national lost an appeal against his internment last October when the special immigration appeals commission backed Mr Blunkett's decision to detain him indefinitely. He was among the original 13 detained in De cember 2001 when the government's emergency anti-terror laws came into effect. </p> <p>Mr Justice Ouseley, the Siac chairman, described him as \"a practised and accomplished liar\". He was said to be an active supporter of the GIA, the Algerian armed Islamic group which is banned in Britain. The Siac ruling said he was based at a Birmingham bookshop where he developed links with Abu Qatada, the Muslim cleric accused of links to al-Qaida who is also interned under the anti-terror laws. </p> <p>Amnesty International's director, Kate Allen, welcomed his release, but added: \"The irony is that the home secretary's decision is, like the internment process itself, secretive, part of a shadow justice system rather than the rule of law.\"</p>",

They feel liberated and cocky, but their parents, in particular their mothers, are anxious at the implications for their futures. In place of school, the boys must attend a social exclusion project, reluctantly at first, until they discover that their learning programme is linked to their great passion - hip-hop. It isn't long before they have a recording deal, and through their own hard work and the support of their teachers and friends, their dream of being a first-rate hip-hop band comes to fruition.</p> <p>But trouble stalks the boys, and because of their pasts, the finger of accusation continues to point in their direction. A turf war breaks out, with fatal consequences - a tour is cancelled and the future looks bleak.</p> <p>Zephaniah's straightforward storytelling has integrity.

  "<p>There is one thing that is generally agreed between those who study and work in further education, those who administer it in the Learning and Skills Council, employers who seek training and the government that recently launched an ambitious skills strategy. It is that we don't put enough resources into the further education sector. That is no surprise. The difference between the UK and rival economies is not so much in school standards or degree studies, but in technician and vocational skills. Yet while the financial needs of universities and schools receive endless coverage, colleges are in fact worse funded than either.</p> <p>But where should the extra money that is needed come from? It would be easy to berate the government for its failure to fund the system, but we ought to hold on a moment. Let us ask what proportion of the budgets of our colleges come from student fees.</p> <p>The answer may come as a surprise to many people: a college is considered to have a strong performance if it takes just 7% of its total costs in fee income. So the average college, with an income of, say, \u00a315m, will raise only \u00a31m of that resource from the people who use it.</p> <p>Some of the reasons for this are understandable. There are national concessions that all providers are obliged to offer to people applying to learn. All 16- to 18-year-old students - and remember, the majority of this age group is in colleges, not schools - do not have to pay fees for their studies. Nor do students on income-related benefits pay fees, or those taking courses to boost their literacy of numeracy skills.</p> <p>But other students are expected to meet 25% of their course costs - and the simple fact is that they rarely do. Even when you take away the fee-free categories, the Learning and Skills Council calculates that there is more than \u00a3100m of fee income that is not collected by colleges. This is money that a hard-pressed sector could use. For the average college, this could fund, for instance, 10 extra teachers or maybe 100 or more internet-ready computers. It could provide a suite of new evening classes, or revitalise a tired library. The question is: why don't colleges collect this money?</p> <p>I recently talked to a range of colleges - large and small, urban and rural, in poor and rich areas - to find out the reasons for the shortfall. The first thing to say is that the problem was hardly ever incompetence. More or less all the colleges I spoke to collected the fees that they asked for.</p> <p>But they rarely asked for the full fee - most of them offered cut-price or free tuition to large numbers of students who fell outside the groups eligible for the national concessions.</p> <p>There were two main reasons for this. One was a real desire to widen participation, a feeling that \"people round here\" can't afford college courses; that they \"just won't come\" if the 25% fee is charged. This is obviously true for some people - those on low wages, or taking a year out to gain access to higher education. But it can't be true of everyone. At the extreme, some offered fee-free tuition for higher level web design courses, or to graduates undertaking recreational language or horticulture programmes.</p> <p>The other driver for fee concessions was competition. Smart college managers try to maximise their recruitment by offering lower fees than the college next door. The problem here is the beggar-my-neighbour behaviour that then follows as others cut their own fees to stay in line, which reduces the resources available to everyone.</p> <p>The truth is that fees are rarely part of a college's financial strategy. Indeed, some colleges I surveyed had only a hazy idea of their fee target and others proudly proclaimed \"we're a widening participation college - we don't charge fees\". As a result, only one student in four actually pays a full fee when they attend college.</p> <p>This position is not sustainable. It is not just the impact that the loss of income inevitably has on the quality of provision that colleges can offer. The ambitions of the government's skills strategy call for additional resources, some of which are expected to come from the learner. And why not? Good technician qualifications, like degrees, add to lifetime earnings. Asking students to invest a little in their own future is not unfair.</p> <p>But colleges will benefit, too, if their budgets can strike a better balance between public and private funding. The reticence to charge fees leaves them more and more dependent on the Learning and Skills Council's ever more stretched funds, at a time when the economy and local communities need resourceful and imaginative colleges, with a control on their own resources that leaves them able to act from a position of strength and autonomy.</p> <p>Colleges have a great product to offer - personal success leading to higher skills, new confidence, a more productive economy. They need the self-confidence to sell it to their customers, rather than give it away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Adrian Perry's report, Talking about fees: Provider policy and practice on course fees, is published by the Learning and Skills Council <a href=\"http://www.lsc.gov.uk\">www.lsc.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>What could the late king of kung fu, Bruce Lee, teach people who want to learn the piano? Sounds a silly question? I thought so, too, but the answer, according to Kim Redford, who teaches the piano, and also the martial art tae-kwon-do, is in fact quite a lot.</p> <p>Redford, a concert pianist, says Lee's approach to combat guides her quest to teach what she calls \"extreme piano\". It is a method that offers the frustrated student the holy grail: dramatic improvement on just five minutes' practice a day.</p> <p>\"I always recommend my students read his autobiography,\" Redford says. \"He had some very striking thoughts. It's about offering your skill in a very soft way, not imposing it on people. He teaches you to examine yourself through observing other individuals.\"</p> <p>It is a very different approach to any you will find in music schools and colleges, she says. \"It's all to do with focus. It's to do with the quality of the time you spend at the piano, not the length of time. If you concentrate totally for only five minutes ... then you don't need to work for any longer than that. It can be counterproductive to spend too much time drilling away.\"</p> <p>I meet Redford at the impressive Steinway Hall, just off Oxford Street in London, where world-class grand pianos cosy up to uprights on an immaculately polished shop floor. When she's not teaching in Devon, Redford hires a small studio in Steinway Hall to accommodate her south-east-based students.</p> <p>Redford's early ambition was to be a dancer and her stature remains that of a ballerina. But an injury at the age of 12 put paid to that aspiration and she turned to the piano. She practised hard and was accepted at Cambridge University to study music. From there she went to the prestigious Paris Conservatoire and became a concert pianist, eventually performing at venues across Europe. But after a while, says Redford, now 31, it seemed as though something was missing.</p> <p>\"Performing is very lonely,\" she explains. \"You miss interacting with people. You're really out there by yourself. I was working really hard and you start sort of living in your head. In the end, I wasn't behaving like a normal human being.\" She decided to take some time off. \"I don't practise at all any more,\" she admits. \"And I now have much more power as a musician. I am also a much calmer person, physically healthier and much less frustrated. I discovered that a lot of the time I had spent practising was wasted because it wasn't productive.\"</p> <p>It is a philosophy Redford is passionate about passing on to her students. Our lesson starts with the basics. Posture - the position of the feet on the floor, the bum on the seat and the hands on the keyboard - is examined and corrected. Redford advocates a lightness and looseness of the joints, but a firm touch on the piano.</p> <p>\"There's nothing like the physical feeling of a piano,\" she says, as the keyboard reverberates to her touch. I tickle the ivories and get a mild ticking off.</p> <p>The teaching studio holds two Steinway concert grand pianos, squeezed in back to back, and much of the lesson is taken up with improvised duets. The idea is to allow certain notes to sing out above the rest. Redford is encouraging and eternally positive. I suspect she's just being nice.</p> <p>\"Sit up, breathe deeply and let it go,\" she trills, twiddling away beautifully while I crash around on the black notes.</p> <p>But there is a serious message here. After hours of practising when she was a concert pianist, Redford found herself stiff and unhappy, with aching shoulders and back. The music became a burden, not a joy. Improvisation is her answer to the constraints of such a strict regimen.</p> <p>And as she withdrew from performing to try to regain her health, she turned to yoga and tae-kwon-do, which she now teaches, too. \"It teaches you self-control, focus and body awareness,\" she says. \"You have to be aware of how you're feeling, how you're positioned, where you're breathing from. All these are skills that have direct relevance to playing the piano.\"</p> <p>She lets rip with an enormous virtuoso cadence that leaves notes hanging like calling cards in the air. I suspect even Bruce Lee would be impressed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.extremepiano.com\">www.extremepiano.com</a></p>",

  "<p><strong>Attention to detail in selection process</strong><br></p> <p>My colleagues and I were disappointed to read a comment on Oxbridge by Steven Schwartz that referred to \"people sitting for five hours in an anteroom and being given a five-minute interview\" (The revolutionary, September 14).</p> <p>The selection procedures in place at Oxford and Cambridge are the most rigorous in the UK. Here at Oxford, candidates normally stay for two days in a student room in college, which allows them to get a true feel for student life here.</p> <p>During their stay they will receive at least two interviews, each about half an hour in length.

These are examined alongside qualifications (predicted and actual), references, written work (for some subjects), and any additional information, giving tutors an exceptionally detailed view of a candidate's ability and potential.</p> <p>We were pleased to read Professor Schwartz's report on university admissions and to see that at Oxford we were implementing many of his recommendations already.

The central premise - that academically able students inevitably make good teachers - is unproven and, in my experience, frequently not the case.</p> <p>Successful teaching is about being able to transfer knowledge in a way that meets the needs of different pupils. If, as the senior teacher quoted in the article suggests, the classroom management skills of the Teach First graduates aren't developed, they will not be able to do this. The main attraction is obviously as a cheap stopgap for teacher shortages.</p> <p>The scheme seems to be selling itself as some kind of domestic VSO, which requires only two years' commitment before the graduates go on to jobs such as \"future ministers, CEOs and serial entrepreneurs\". Not headteachers, I notice. In the long run this is not helpful to schools, as it does not provide continuity. Their colleagues will have wasted their valuable time on people who are attracted to the scheme because, as the article admits, they don't have to commit.

In terms of relevance and impact, many of the best projects are small and local. Under research assessment exercise (RAE) criteria, they were deemed not to be of \"international\" excellence. The panel for 2001 wanted more longitudinal, quantitative studies. Some of us fought to get relevance and impact as key criteria but achieved only secondary status for them. That may account for the relatively low average of grades in the education unit of assessment.</p> <p>There is a further issue for the 2008 RAE. The majority of students are in the post-compulsory sector, but the linking of education with psychology and sports-related studies implies a concept of education as \"a healthy mind in a healthy body\", with emphasis on formation. The main growth in research is in the post-school sector.

  "<p>There's a teaching crisis. Schools are facing huge staff shortages, triggered by an ageing profession, and exacerbated by low teacher morale and abundant opportunities in more attractive graduate jobs. Even areas insulated from the worst difficulties are seeing a fortress mentality develop, as schools compete for staff.</p> <p>This is \"meltdown\", one of six near-future scenarios that make up the core of Futuresight, a new toolkit for headteachers, launched today by the National College for School Leadership (NCSL). The one-day seminar asks heads to consider a series of future possibilities and plot their preferred outcomes from the detail they are given.</p> <p>Others scenarios include the vision that formal schooling will be abandoned and instead small group and home schooling arrangements become widespread; or that a deregulated learning market will be created; or that schools will become the main source of social integration.</p> <p>Futuresight is Britain's contribution to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Schooling for Tomorrow project. \"There are possibilities, probabilities and preferences - and the choices we make change what is possible into what is probable,\" says Riel Miller, the OECD strategist who designed the original scenarios for Germany's Expo 2000 exhibition. The NCSL adapted the project for UK schools in partnership with the innovation unit at the Department for Education and Skills and the thinktank Demos.</p> <p>\"This was different from anything else I'd been on before,\" says Anthony McNamara, head of St Augustine's Roman Catholic high school in Lancashire. McNamara took part in the Futuresight field trials and immediately began moves to do follow-up work with his senior staff and governors. \"It was the most exciting thing I'd been to in 10 years as a head,\" he says.</p> <p>The college is also mapping out its own future. Four years ago this week, the college was given its brief in a letter from the then education secretary, David Blunkett. But it will shortly have a new chief executive and a new strategy, and the outgoing head of the college has been doing some future thinking of her own, some of which chimes with the remarks of Sir Dexter Hutt elsewhere in EducationGuardian. \"We face huge difficulties unless we can collaborate effectively,\" says Heather du Quesnay, who leaves the college at the end of this term. \"We just cannot continue on a corner-shop basis, with each school trying to invent its own solutions. Over time it may be a much more economic model to group schools together with a CEO or superhead.\"</p> <p>Ten years ago, headteachers were cogs in the government machine. At best, they might expect to attend the occasional conference, where tepid tea and warm sandwiches emphasised their lack of status. But the college was designed to transform that image. The NCSL moved into a temporary site at Nottingham University in November 2000. Two years later, Blair opened the new \u00a328m college headquarters there.</p> <p>The core business of the NCSL is the five-stage leadership programme. Almost 13,000 teachers have been awarded the national professional qualification for headship (NPQH), which became a mandatory requirement for new headteachers earlier this year. A further 10,000 have taken the leadership programme for serving headteachers (LPSH), a programme so tough that it has taken some heads close to a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>LPSH involves a process called 360-degree feedback, where heads are given an anonymous briefing on what their colleagues think of their performance. \"LPSH nearly led to me leaving the profession,\" said one head. \"It took about a month to put myself back together again.\"</p> <p>But the leaders of the headteachers' unions are upbeat about the NCSL's contribution.</p> <p>\"I think the college has done very well,\" says John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association (SHA). \"The feedback we get is largely positive.\"</p> <p>At the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT), David Hart says: \"The college's core programmes are not only essential but popular.\"</p> <p>Other NCSL programmes include New Visions, for newly appointed headteachers; Leading from the Middle, for school heads of department; a bursar's qualification in school business management; and the new national professional qualification in integrated community leadership.</p> <p>When a compulsory qualification for headteachers was first mooted, it was predicted that it would have the opposite effect of that intended, and act as a disincentive. At first, this prediction looked like becoming a reality - in its first form the NPQH was a content-rich, academic programme supervised by the Teacher Training Agency.</p> <p>There were complaints about the huge amount of paperwork generated. Candidates were said to be motivated solely by the \"need to get through\". Significantly, many people who got headships failed to complete the course.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2000, David Blunkett gave the NCSL control over headteachers' professional development. One of Heather du Quesnay's first acts was to re-examine the college's leadership programmes. Dame Pat Collarbone, from London's Institute of Education, carried out a review. The result was a slimmed-down, more focused qualification.</p> <p>Suzanne O'Farrell, deputy headteacher of Thomas Alleynes high school in Staffordshire, has just completed her NPQH. \"We had face-to-face training sessions, role-play exercises, a residential assessment ... then there are the self-study units, 16 in four modules. On the residential they employ actors to role-play scenarios, such as a disciplinary meeting with a teacher, or a confrontation with a parent. It was the most terrifying experience, and an excellent learning opportunity,\" she says.</p> <p>Candidates have to be nominated by their heads and part of the assessment is school-based. Peter Mitchell, head of Thomas Alleynes, nominated O'Farrell because it is his policy to ask his deputies to take the course. The school has several senior staff on NPQH.</p> <p>\"When people apply for a deputy headship, I tell them they have to start their NPQH within two years and complete it in four,\" he says. Mitchell thinks the qualification fills gaps in people's experience, and prepares them for the occasions when they have to stand in as head. \"At any moment they might have to cover for me,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I did it because I wanted to do my job as a deputy as well as I could,\" says O'Farrell, who is responsible for teachers' professional development at Thomas Alleynes. But she has no immediate plans to apply for a headship.</p> <p>\"I might get to the stage where I want to put some of this knowledge and experience into practice, but I don't think I've learnt enough yet,\" she says.</p> <p>The quality of the current NPQH has long-serving heads ever so slightly envious of their younger colleagues. \"We had to learn by the seat of our pants,\" says Jack Hatch. The head of St Bede's primary in Bolton was not impressed by the mark-one NPQH. \"But it's much better now.\"</p> <p>NCSL researchers argue that education's leaders aren't born - their development begins as soon as they enter teaching. Good schools invest in their staff and good leaders work hard to ensure that their replacements are already making their way up the system.</p> <p>\"The important thing is to get people to see themselves as leaders,\" says du Quesnay. \"And that is happening. Heads of department are beginning to see themselves as leaders of people.\" But the traditional picture of the authoritarian headteacher at the top of the pyramid is changing, du Quesnay believes.</p> <p>\"The traditional picture is a very hierarchical one,\" she says. \"We may like symbolic figures who make the world seem safe, but you can't run a school simply through the character of the person at the top.\"</p> <p>There are changes ahead. An independently chaired review of the college's activities published earlier this year praised the NCSL's \"substantial contribution to school leadership development\", but the review directs the college down a more strategic path, less involved with course delivery. There will be more partners, and more use of outside expertise. \"We feel that it is the right moment for the college to refocus,\" says du Quesnay. \"We need to draw on a wider range of expertise.\"</p> <p>Her replacement will also have to live with a less generous funding regime. The college's current budget of almost \u00a3112m faces substantial cuts. Until this term, the college's programmes were largely free to schools. That will change. Charging began this term on the flagship NPQH programme and the DfES believes there are \"undoubted benefits from a shift away from subsidy\".</p> <p>Both SHA and the NAHT welcome the shift of focus at the college. \"I've always been concerned that they have been expected to deliver the earth,\" says David Hart. \"There was a tendency for the DfES to think that the college was the answer to every initiative.\"</p>",
  "<p>From the train up from London, David Miliband, the schools standards minister, alights at Birmingham International station, ready for a busy afternoon of meeting and greeting. He's here to visit three inner-city comprehensives that were once among the worst in the country but have undergone an extraordinary turnaround.</p> <p>Miliband talks excitedly about urban regeneration - a theme he explored at length in the Guardian recently in an unusual ministerial collaboration with the historian Tristram Hunt. \"I do believe that good schools are the key to reviving our cities. One of the strongest messages from this year's GCSE results is that there have been some spectacular improvements in urban education. I would even go so far as to describe it as a revolution.\"</p> <p>Greeting the minister at the station is one of New Labour's newest \"education knights\", the passionate Sir Dexter Hutt, who at the beginning of this term took up a new role as \"executive head\" of the trio of schools where he now oversees the work of three separate headteachers in the federation. At each of the schools, Ninestiles (Hutt's original base), Waverley and International, which form the new-style federation or \"cluster\", the proportion of pupils achieving five or more good GCSEs increased significantly year on year. The schools were all once rejected by local parents and slated by the press, but are now on the local map for positive reasons. The Ninestiles Federation is being hailed as a national model by the Department for Education and Skills, and Miliband wants to find out whether there is potential for it to be replicated elsewhere.</p> <p>Inevitably Hutt, knighted in this year's new year's honours for his work here, has been described as a \"superhead\", but it's an idea he rejects. \"I genuinely don't believe in the superhead notion,\" he maintains. \"The idea that one person can take what he's learned at one school and apply it to another, while trying to run both, is not on. Schools are more complex than that. But what we can do is fast-track the expertise that we've built up over many years, into other schools and achieve rapid improvement.\"</p> <p>First stop for Miliband is the International school, the newest entrant to the federation, which derives its name not from its intake (its pupils are actually predominantly white working-class), but from its proximity to Birmingham International airport. To prove the point, a passenger jet roars perilously close over the school's roof as the minister's car heads into the driveway. He bounds in confidently - most definitely not a \"year 8 in a suit\" - firing questions and stopping to peer at exam results posted on the school noticeboard.</p> <p>Last year's GCSE results were so poor that the International was ranked the fourth worst in the country. Just 9% obtained five A*-Cs. This year the proportion of students getting five or more good GCSEs leapt to 33%, close to next year's target of 35%.</p> <p>The headteacher of the International school, Ruth Robinson, introduces five students who all came away with commendable results this summer - clutches of GCSEs and vocational qualifications at respectable, if not top, grades, including youngsters who, at one stage, were predicted to get nothing at all.</p> <p>Miliband questions each of them in turn, congratulating them before pressing them on how the school has changed since it became part of the federation last October, after emerging from the ashes of two previously failing schools, Sir Wilfrid Martineau and Byng Kenrick Central. It is now a mixed, community secondary school with 1,588 pupils on roll between the ages of 11 and 18, incorporating East Birmingham Community College for the 16-18 age group.</p> <p>He wants to know from these youngsters, who experienced at first hand the previous, failing regime, what is different now, and how a long-standing \"culture of no aspiration\" has been eradicated in just a year.</p> <p>The pupils are clear that two main factors are responsible for the transformation: first, the arrival of a permanent core of new teachers to replace the previous army of temporary supply staff; and second, a programme dubbed \"B for L\" (behaviour for learning), which when articulated with a strong Birmingham accent sounds even more mysterious. Miliband urges one of them, Vince Bridgen, to explain it to him.</p> <p>The scheme sounds simple and it is. It is a behavioural code with graded sanctions on an \"escalator\". The rules are set out in writing for both students and teachers, so there is no scope for ambiguity or misinterpretation.</p> <p>A student committing a \"first misbehaviour\", such as talking during a lesson, will be given a verbal warning, which is graded as a C1. A \"fourth misbehaviour\" attracts a C4, or isolation. Arriving later than three minutes for a lesson attracts a C3, or an hour-long detention, which has led to huge improvements in punctuality.</p> <p>\"Before, there were hardly any rules at all,\" says Vince. \"We could come in late or misbehave and no one would say anything. This is a bit like a football yellow card/red card scheme. We are treated like adults so we are more likely to behave like adults. We come to learn, rather than come to play up.\"</p> <p>The scheme has also won the support of pupils because it is \"impersonal\" and school-wide, which takes out any scope for accusations that teachers are gunning for their pupils, Hutt adds.</p> <p>Miliband is particularly struck by one youngster's remarks that he was \"jealous\" of the new year 7s, the first years: \"It's different for them because they're experiencing the improved school.\"</p> <p>In a separate session with the deputy heads and chair of governors, Marie Crook, Miliband praises the work staff have done in raising standards, returning to his key theme of urban regeneration: \"We're interested in system improvement, not just school improvement. Good systems are portable, so there is no reason why things working in this federation cannot be used elsewhere.\"</p> <p>Next stop is Waverley, a mixed community secondary school with 665 pupils between the ages of 11 and 16. Like the International, it is to the east of the city centre in Small Heath, where there is a high level of disadvantage, both economic and social. Some 85% of pupils are from a Muslim background, which Hutt cites as \"proof that you don't have to have segregated single-faith schools to achieve good results\".</p> <p>This year, the proportion of pupils getting five or more good GCSEs rose to a very respectable 62%, having more than tripled to 52% last year, from 18% in 2002.</p> <p>Waverley had been on its knees, close to being put into special measures in February 2001, when Hutt and his team were brought in by the local education authority. \"My then deputy, Christine Quinn, went in as head,\" Hutt explains. \"We had a jointly produced strategy and it was her job to implement it. Last year, Waverley was the most improved school in Birmingham and one of the six most improved in the country. But there's a difference between improving exam results and changing a school's culture. The idea of the federation was to have the right head in post, use our joint experience in terms of strategy, and put our skilled teachers at their disposal when possible.\"</p> <p>Hutt's trusted senior staff have got used to working in a \"merry go-round\" arrangement - switching schools to different, albeit always senior roles, when their support is needed. Waverley's head now is John Allen, previously deputy to Christine Quinn. He admits he would like a sixth form to crown the school's success. But even he still can't quite believe the rate of improvement. \"Waverley had falling rolls, as parents voted with their feet. But for our 145 year 7 places for this September, 580 families put us down as their preference. I think most parents want three things for their children - to be safe, to be happy and to do well. Clearly we are achieving all those things.\"</p> <p>In a quiet moment, Miliband says he is struck by the simplicity of Hutt's educational vision. \"If you get the discipline sorted, you can free the teachers up to do their jobs properly and make kids more likely to want to learn.\"</p> <p>Last, but not least, off to Ninestiles, where many students come from Estelle Morris's Birmingham Yardley constituency and which is long established on the educational map. Tony Blair visited in 1999 and DfES officials come regularly. When Hutt took over 16 years ago, Ninestiles was ranked among the worst schools in the country. A third of the pupils were leaving with no qualifications whatsoever. Only 6% were achieving five Cs or better at GCSE. Last year 76% achieved five or more good GCSEs; this year that figure dropped slightly to 72%.</p> <p>\"There was a dip but I think it's fair to say that was the price that was paid for the work we were doing at International,\" Hutt explains. \"It's a sufficiently strong and stable school to bounce back next year and we expect it to get 85% then.\" The school is also at the cutting edge of technology and boasts the largest school \"wireless network\" in Europe.</p> <p>Quinn made the move to head up the International last October and has this term returned to Ninestiles, taking over from Hutt as head. He remarks that she is probably the only person in the country to be head of three schools in 12 months for positive reasons. She describes her experience with the federation as the most rewarding of her career: \"The good thing is feeling that you are not on your own,\" she explains. \"We have the benefits of the support network of a federation, yet the schools retain their own identities.\"</p> <p>These benefits include recruiting staff under the umbrella of the Ninestiles Federation, a particular boon for the International school, which in the past has struggled to attract qualified staff. Ruth Robinson agrees: \"Every school in the federation is unique. We get the benefits of cooperation and being able to share best practice, but, at the same time, we retain a sense of individuality.\" For example, the schools have separate governing bodies, although there are overlapping steering groups. Fifteen advanced skills teachers based at Ninestiles also visit the other schools, while all the teachers have laptops.</p> <p>Hutt points out that the arrangement is the only \"hard federation\" in the country, with a series of four-way contracts involving Ninestiles, the school, Birmingham LEA and the DfES. \"There are a series of targets but there are no penalties as such, except for all our heads on the block\", Hutt laughs. The schools get additional funding, but the LEA does not interfere directly and its role is a supporting one.</p> <p>In a presentation to Miliband, staff explain effusively why they find teaching exciting, having been freed up from disciplinary issues to concentrate on it. That's not to say staff don't have concerns - the local National Union of Teachers representative from the International school gives the minister a very hard time during a private session about workload issues.</p> <p>But the day ends on a high point. Reminded by Hutt that he must leave to catch a plane to his constituency in the north-east, Miliband cannot seem to drag himself away and is fascinated by the presentation on how ICT is being used in teaching and learning. He presses Hutt on whether there is scope for other schools to join the federation. \"I'm sure there is a limit to how many you can have in a federation,\" Hutt says. \"But I'm not yet sure what it is.\"</p> <p>Leadership is critical, Hutt concludes. \"What we are doing here is good, but we mustn't take it for granted. Leadership skills required are of a much higher order than they once were. Our federation heads have to have exceptional leadership and management skills to implement the required pace of change. The question becomes whether we have a public-sector pool of 3,500 people with the right credentials, or whether we need executive heads of federations to plan strategies and to train future federation heads.\" No prizes for guessing Hutt's answer to his own question.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Additional reporting by Chris Arnot</p>",
  "<p>Britain's prized network of free-to-use cash machines is \"under threat\", with the number of ATMs that charge increasing by 40% in the first six months of this year, according to a report published today. </p> <p>Nationwide building society, a long-time campaigner on the issue, said providers of fee-charging machines were pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy, with the problem exacerbated by banks selling off some of their ATMs to independent operators. </p> <p>Four years after Nationwide scored a victory in a battle with Barclays over ATM charges, the society said the rapid rise of so-called convenience machines meant charging was once again a real issue. </p> <p>It warned that, unless urgent action was taken, \"in a few years' time we could all have to pay to get access to our own cash\". </p> <p>Britain has the fastest growing cash machine network in western Europe, and it is part of everyday life for most people, with two-thirds of adults using them regularly. </p> <p>Five years ago, virtually all cash machines in Britain were free to use, but in June this year 18,500 ATMs - more than a third of the network - were charging a fee of \u00a31.25 or \u00a31.50 per withdrawal, rising to as much as \u00a35 in a few cases. </p> <p>While some of these machines are located in remote areas that, arguably, would not justify the cost of installing a machine, many are located in busy shopping centres, post offices, railway stations and cinemas. </p> <p>Britain's consumers are already paying out more than \u00a360m a year in ATM charges, and this will increase as the number of machines imposing charges grows, said Nationwide. Almost two-thirds of the 5,635 machines installed in 2003 were fee-charging. </p> <p>Hanco, Britain's largest fee-charging ATM operator, was recently bought for a rumoured \u00a380m by Royal Bank of Scotland. In May, HBOS sold 816 of its ATMs, located mainly in petrol stations, to rival operator Cardpoint. </p> <p>Last year, Abbey sold 50 machines located at Shell garages to another of the sector's big players, Moneybox. Between them, Hanco, Cardpoint and Moneybox now control more than half of all fee-charging machines. </p> <p>It emerged this year that about 1,500 of the 2,100 cash machines in post offices charge a fee. </p> <p>\"Free cash machines are under threat, despite the calls from the media, consumer bodies and the government,\" said Stuart Bernau, executive director at Nationwide. </p> <p>The society threatened legal action in 2000 during a hard-fought battle over ATM charges. Barclays and other banks eventually caved in to public pressure, ditching planned surcharges.</p>",
  "The Church of England said yesterday that police counter-terrorism operations were directed disproportionately against Muslims and risked alienating them. <p>In a submission to the Commons home affairs committee, the church's mission and public affairs council supported a proposed law against incitement to religious hatred, including towards Muslims, to preserve community relations. </p> <p>The submission, signed by Dr Tom Butler, Bishop of Southwark, said: \"In recent years stop and search powers have been employed disproportionately against Muslims...</p> <p>\"While this situation is not the same as that facing black communities in earlier times, confrontational methods of policing are likely to prove counter-productive, as they risk increasing radicalisation of young Muslims in particular. </p> <p>\"It can be argued that counter-terrorist operations directed against al-Qaida could be expected to affect the Muslim population disproportionately, but the scale of the disparity in a number of areas and the lack of objective justifications for it suggest that the explanation is unlikely to be reassuring. </p> <p>\"That Muslim communities experience counter-terrorist policy as discriminatory and threatening is a serious cause for concern.\" </p> <p>All the churches have tried to show solidarity with local Muslims in recent years, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, taking the lead in fostering dialogue. </p> <p>But Muslims reacted angrily when his predecessor, George Carey, who had himself fostered dialogue, argued earlier this year that their leaders should do more to condemn terrorism and that their faith was becoming associated with violence around the world. </p> <p>Much more cautiously, yesterday's submission argued that the claim by al-Qaida that it was an Islamic organisation defending Islamic interests was the big threat to community relations. </p> <p>\"This [claim] may encourage misrepresentation by some people of Muslims ... as supportive of terrorism, and conversely misrepresentation of counter-terrorist measures as essentially anti-Islamic...</p> <p>\"Many in the Muslim community feel isolated, anxious and misunderstood within wider society as a result of the current situation.\" </p> <p>It said that the powers of arrest under the Terrorism Act 2000 had been used disproportionately against Muslims, and the provisions of the following year's Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act had led to differential treatment of British and foreign nationals, the latter being liable to indefinite detention. </p> <p>\"[This] contributes powerfully to a sense of double standards of justice, liberty and dignity between British citizens and others, most of whom are Muslims, and indirectly to a sense of injustice ... new efforts should be made to frame legislation which deals with all terrorism regardless of the nationality of suspects.\" </p> <p>The church called on the media to exercise restraint and not reinforce prejudices, adding: \"It is very unfortunate that the opinions of a handful of unrepresentative extreme figures are regularly given prominence.\" </p> <p>Good community relations required the unequal legal protection given to different religions to be rectified, though the church added that legislation should penalise religiously motivated incitement of harm but not robust argument in the criticism of religious beliefs and practices, even though some might find that offensive.</p>",
  "Defendants facing murder charges will be encouraged to plead guilty early to cut a third off their prison term, under draft guidelines unveiled yesterday by the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf. <p>In exceptional circumstances, judges should consider a reduction of even more than a third, says the guidance, issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which Lord Woolf chairs. </p> <p>Examples include cases such as a domestic murder where the killer immediately feels remorse and turns himself over to the police, or where the offender confesses to an unsolved crime in the absence of any evidence linking him to it. </p> <p>A range of discounts will apply to all offences, from a third to a 10th, depending on how early a defendant pleads guilty. </p> <p>The guidelines point out that a guilty plea removes the need for a trial, spares victims and witnesses the stress of reliving the incident, and saves money. They formalise a system already operating in the courts whereby early guilty pleas are rewarded with reductions in sentence. </p> <p>But they should have their biggest effects in murder cases because very few defendants charged with murder currently plead guilty. </p> <p>Under the guidelines, the trial judge fixing the \"tariff\", or minimum term a murderer must serve before applying for parole, will be able to cut the term in return for a guilty plea. It would still be up to the pa role board to decide whether it was safe for the prisoner to be released. </p> <p>It was assumed that murderers would spend longer in prison after the home secretary, David Blunkett, introduced a new 15-year minimum tariff for murders committed after December 18 2003. This replaced earlier guidance by Lord Woolf that the starting point for a \"normal\" murder should be 12 years. The average time served by a convicted murderer was then 11 years. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett signalled a battle over the guidelines, which he said still had to be approved by the home affairs select committee. </p> <p>He added: \"Parliament was very clear when it passed the act that those convicted of murder should receive minimum sentences ranging from 15 years to whole life, depending on their circumstances. This deliberately toughened up earlier legislation, passed by previous governments. </p> <p>\"The only exceptions to the minimum tariffs in the act should be very specific aggravating or mitigating circumstances - mercy killing or where self defence is a factor.\" </p> <p>Lord Woolf clashed with the home secretary over proposals that parliament should fix a minimum term, and the lord chief justice made a speech in the Lords about the threat to judges' independence. </p> <p>But Lord Woolf said yesterday that after studying the legislation it was clear that the 15-year minimum was just a \"guideline\" which still left considerable flexibility to judges. </p> <p>Last July he issued a practice direction to judges which stated: \"It should not be assumed that parliament, in enacting the Criminal Justice Act 2003, intended to raise to 15 years all mandatory life sentence minimum terms that would previously have had a lower starting point.\" </p> <p>Yesterday he said judges still had discretion, despite the 15-year minimum, to fix much lower tariffs - possibly as low as two years in mercy-killing cases - as they had done in the past. </p> <p>He expected that the effect of the minimum tariff combined with the guidance on discounts for guilty pleas would probably be \"neutral\", meaning no change to the average term served by murderers. </p> <p>Under the guidelines, sentences (and tariffs in murder cases) would be cut by a third if the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, a quarter if the plea came after the trial was set down, and a 10th for a plea after the trial had started. </p> <p>Guidelines published yesterday also advise judges on new sentences coming into force next year. Community regimes will be harsher and offenders released from jail part of the way through their sentence will have to comply with rigorous requirements, which will be monitored, for the rest of the sentence.</p>"
