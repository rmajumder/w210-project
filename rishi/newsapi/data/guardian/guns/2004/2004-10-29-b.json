  "<p><strong>Troll Fell</strong><br>by Katherine Langrish<br>318pp, Collins, \u00a310.99</p> <p>The background to Troll Fell is familiar from Ibsen's play in which Peer Gynt goes up into the Dovre mountains and narrowly escapes being married to the Troll King's daughter. A troll wedding is at the heart of Katherine Langrish's first novel, a dynastic marriage arranged by the King of Dovrefell and the Gaffer of Troll Fell, and her hero is another Peer, Peer Ulfsson, orphaned and snatched away from his father's funeral by one of his twin uncles, the millers of Troll Fell, who have sinister plans for him.</p> <p>Peer's only friends initially are his dog and Hilde, a local farmer's daughter who seems to be included in the millers' scheme. The brothers have their eye on a mountain pasture belonging to Hilde's father, which they believe will give them access to the Gaffer's underground hall and his treasure hoard. The book is set in the 10th century, but there is little sense of the period (admittedly a difficult one to realise). Indeed Peer and Hilde might have wandered out of the 21st century, and most of the characters speak in modern clich\u00e9s. Even the paradoxical trolls, with their vast wealth and dubious domestic standards, are nearly as flat of speech as the humans.</p> <p>All of which would add up to a catalogue of missed opportunities were it not for a third world of creatures who are exuberantly brought to life. The humans live on the mountain, the trolls live beneath it, coming out to make a nuisance of themselves to farmers and villagers. But there is also the Nis, a hearth-spirit who keeps the house tidy in exchange for food. It is on short commons in the millers' household and spots a likely ally in the ill-used Peer. Sly, self-pitying - it refers to itself in the third person - but essentially good-hearted, it lights up the narrative every time it appears. Stories that marry the everyday and the supernatural too often fall down on the supernatural element. Here the reverse is true. Peer's encounters with these beings from our common folklore are the most convincing and engaging episodes in the book.</p> <p>The trolls are fun, the children are brave, the villains hissable and the plot involving, but Langrish's talent lies with what the late Katherine Briggs would have included in the term \"fairies\". The Nis is a cousin to Briggs's Hobberdy Dick, and since that was reissued in 1978, followed by her Abbey Lubbers, Banshees and Boggarts, no one, apart from William Mayne with his Hob stories, has really mined this enormous resource. Langrish clearly knows her fairies. It would be good to see her working this seam in future.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jan Mark's books include Useful Idiots (David Fickling)</p>",
  "<p>The Manchurian Candidate of 1962, directed by John Frankenheimer from Richard Condon's thriller, is a chunk of America's psycho-history - as much oracle as movie - steeped in what Norman Mailer called \"that concentration of ecstasy and violence which is the dream life of the nation\". Not surprisingly, Jonathan Demme's remake, conceived in the aftermath of 9/11 and opening in the midst of the 2004 presidential campaign, has been received as an intervention, a desecration, a revision and an all-purpose metaphor. </p> <p>Condon's 1959 bestseller featured a Korean war hero created and programmed by the Chinese communists to serve as the \"sleeper\" assassin who will allow anti-communist triple agents to stage an election year coup d'etat. In essence, Condon suggested the cold war was a Soviet-American co-production. US electoral politics were represented as the province of communist dupes and zombie secret agents, while the novel's demagogic Joseph McCarthy figure himself turned out to be a Soviet creation. One brain washed the other; left- and right-wing paranoia merged. The scenario was nothing less than a satiric version of the John Birch Society's Black Book, which held President Dwight D Eisenhower to be a dedicated servant of the international communist conspiracy. </p> <p>Produced by its star Frank Sinatra's company and released by United Artists, The Manchurian Candidate became the quintessential Kennedy-era thriller. Indeed, there's a sense in which the movie is the Kennedy era - the epitome of glamour and anxiety, an anthology of cold- war anxieties ranging from TV image-building to communist infiltration of the government, which materialised at the height of the Cuban missile crisis to startle audiences with a baroque tale of mind-control, assassination and conspiracy. </p> <p>Sinatra was known to be a presidential pal and, when the Democratic honchos who then ran UA deemed The Manchurian Candidate too controversial to touch, Kennedy proved instrumental in getting the movie made. (Although JFK previewed The Manchurian Candidate at the White House in late August 1962, history does not record his response. Perhaps he was distracted - that day a U-2 spy plane had reported eight missile installations in Cuba that were only weeks away from being operational.) Two months later, The Manchurian Candidate had its premiere as Soviet ships steamed towards the US quarantine line surrounding Cuba, and Under-Secretary of State George Ball warned UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson that there could be a \"shooting war\" by the following afternoon. </p> <p> The Manchurian Candidate opened at the climax of the cold war and fulfilled its prophetic mission 13 months later when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. One researcher recently proposed The Manchurian Candidate as the \"trigger film\" for the ex-marine, returned defector, sniper-or-patsy Lee Harvey Oswald. There's no proof that Oswald ever saw or even heard of The Manchurian Candidate but, even so, the circuit is complete: the movie Kennedy inspired also served as his death warrant. </p> <p>That the Manchurian candidate is a myth may be gauged by two seemingly indestructible misapprehensions, both regularly reiterated in reviews of Demme's remake. The first is the stubborn insistence that the 1962 movie had been a commercial failure and was thus an arcane message or a missed prophecy. In fact, having supplanted Darryl Zanuck's D-Day epic The Longest Day, The Manchurian Candidate reigned as national box-office champ (just in time for Kennedy's mid-term elections). The second misapprehension is that, following the Kennedy assassination, a remorseful Sinatra withdrew the movie from circulation. On the contrary: The Manchurian Candidate was re-released in early 1964 and, revived in the 1970s, it was used to \"explain\" the election-altering shootings of Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy and George Wallace. (Truman Capote made waves in 1968 when he proposed on The Tonight Show that RFK assassin Sirhan Sirhan was a programmed \"Manchurian candidate\".) </p> <p>Six months after the Wallace shooting in 1972, and a decade after The Manchurian Candidate's initial release, Sinatra reasserted his rights in a contractual dispute with UA and the movie disappeared from cinemas, if not television or popular consciousness. The Manchurian Candidate 's extremely literal and highly fanciful view of behavioural modification remained topical, particularly after revelations of CIA mind-control experiments became public in the mid-1970s. Some 25 years after its release, a network television documentary based on John Marks' 1980 CIA expos\u00e9, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, used clips from the Frankenheimer film to illustrate its thesis. </p> <p>Slick and sombre, Demme's new Candidate lacks the giddy insolence of its predecessor. The tale of a programmed \"sleeper\" assassin, a high-level political conspiracy, and an election-year coup isn't played for gleeful dark comedy; the update recalls Alan Pakula's post-Watergate, crypto- Manchurian remake The Parallax View as much as Frankenheimer's original. Gone is Frankenheimer's svelte Resnais-influenced integration of dreams, flashbacks and daylight reality. The cold war is no longer the nightmare from which Frank Sinatra is trying to awake. Rather, it's the new world order. The bogus military hero Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) and his commanding officer (Denzel Washington in the Sinatra role) have their brains washed during Operation Desert Storm; the title now refers to the mega- corporate Manchurian Global, part Halliburton, part Carlyle Group. Coup d'\u00e9tat has been reformulated as \"regime change\" and there's a red-meat evocation of \"the first privately owned and operated vice president of the United States\". </p> <p>Sinatra's daughter Tina had long been interested in a Manchurian remake, but the project was only given the go-ahead in September 2001. The new version was co-produced by Democratic activist Scott Rudin for Paramount Pictures, whose head of production, Sherry Lansing, is a contributor to the Kerry campaign - as is Sumner Redstone, CEO of Paramount's corporate parent, Viacom. (Paramount has also released Hollywood's most scurrilous contribution to the political season, the raunchy puppet animation Team America: World Police.) Several writers were involved but, according to Rudin, once he and Daniel Pyne (who previously adapted The Sum of All Fears) shifted the emphasis to corporate chicanery, \"You could feel the script start to be alive.\" </p> <p>The second Manchurian Candidate belongs to Bush II nearly as much as the original did to JFK. The movie was in production during the run-up to and early months of the Iraq war, with dialogue rewritten in the light of unfolding events. And, from the opening theme, Wyclef Jean's cover of the anti-Bush anthem Fortunate Son , through the references to \"no-bid contracts\", computerised voting and constant terror alerts, to the elaboration of a corporate conspiracy to install a \"sleeper\" as president, the remake is an unambiguous attack on the current American administration. Despite the internet-fuelled rumour that Meryl Streep was evoking Hillary Clinton for her character, her portrayal of the candidate's mother is far more evocative of Bush aide Karen Hughes - or perhaps even Bush's own mother who, according to Kevin Phillips's American Dynasty, had spoken of becoming First Lady as early as the late 1940s. </p> <p>A week before the second Candidate opened, the New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman, a relentless Bush critic, imagined a scenario for \"The Arabian Candidate\" in which Islamic fanatics installed a puppet US president who presented himself as the leader in a war against terrorism. Opening in the US less than 24 hours after the Democratic National Convention ended, the movie struck Krugman's colleague, the cultural pundit Frank Rich, as being so blatantly partisan that it \"could pass for the de facto fifth day of the convention itself\". </p> <p>Of course, rightwing websites were already attacking John Kerry as a Manchurian candidate - a bogus war hero under the control of billionaire George Soros - just as Bush's one-time Republican rival, Senator John McCain, had been smeared four years ago as another such \"candidate\", brainwashed in a North Vietnam POW camp. All of the candidates had their Manchurian aspect - not least the third-party perennial, Ralph Nader, who, as several commentators pointed out, seemed determined to ensure Bush's victory and thus a pro-corporate agenda he ostensibly opposes, in a second consecutive election. </p> <p>Demme's movie, too, has been attacked as a \"Naderite yelp against Democratic backsliding\" (The New Republic ), as well as characterised, more approvingly, \"the most extravagantly Chomskyite movie Hollywood has ever made\" (In These Times). Significantly, its release coincides with the remarkable success, at least in New York's alt-film world, of the Canadian horror-doc The Corporation, which applies the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to demonstrate that corporations are by nature psychopathic - self-absorbed, irresponsible, manipulative and unable to empathise or feel remorse. </p> <p>There's no need for a Joe McCarthy-like demagogue in the new Manchurian Candidate . Demagoguery has been dispersed, institutionalised and built into the workings of the national entertainment state that has rationalised, if not replaced, the old American dream life. Paranoia, in the Manchurian remake, is blatantly orchestrated, with a steady background of terrorist and counter-terrorist chatter and a sense of constant surveillance. Patriotic pageantry is even more hysterical and Pavlovian than in the original - and, in the deployment of heroic New York City firefighters and Mount Rushmore, makes a reasonably accurate prediction of Republican campaign ads. </p> <p>These days, regime change through the strategic elimination of political leaders is no longer an issue, at least in the US. Nor is the construction of history's secret agent. A mysterious squarish bulge visible beneath President Bush's suit jacket during his first debate with John Kerry led to much media speculation that he was wired with some sort of radio receiver. Still, the most retrograde aspect of the new Candidate is the use of the old-fashioned Jos\u00e9 Delgado-type brain implants. </p> <p>As demonstrated by the terror alerts that have figured in the current presidential campaign, along with the new Department of Homeland Security's blandly issued threat of a cancelled election, it's not the assassins who are being programmed with sinister microchips - it is America's body politic. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Manchurian Candidate is released on November 19.

  "<p>My garden is not asked to be productive. The chief interest here is in beauty. Although I like to think that at certain times of the year there is beauty in the general overall effect, this is not one of those places that look like enormous flower arrangements - with carefully planned, meticulously controlled, contrasts and sequences of colours. Beauty is sought as much in the form of the individual plant, its unusual properties, its relation to the rest of the plant world that we know.</p> <p>There is this matter of variation - not variegation, as in the multicoloured leaf (welcome though such are), but variation in the sense that each species represents some critical variation on a theme. Every variety is like a hypothesis: this might be a successful way of existing in the world. And when I find that one plant suits us well, my instinct is always to ask what other forms there are in that area, and how many we can grow to advantage.</p> <p>It starts, say, with a simple hawthorn, some ornamental variety of Crataegus. In next to no time there will be two or three. We do not aspire to an arboretum, but a crataegetum, a collection of different hawthorns - that we might well aim for.</p> <p>At this time of year attention and anxiety are focused on the spindles, Euonymus europaeus and its relatives. They offer three things: brilliant autumn leaf colours, astonishingly pink seed capsules with orange seeds, and an odd corky growth along the branches which, while you would be hard put to call it beautiful, is characteristic, one might say diagnostic.</p> <p>The corkiness is the spindle's contribution to the winter look of the garden. The colour of autumn leaf and fruit is a source of anxiety because not every species or variety is reliable, and not every year is the same. Each autumn I wonder whether to get rid of a large E phellomanus, our best euonymus from the point of view of vigour, its young shoots irreproachably \"furnished with four conspicuous corky wings, which give them a square shape\" (as WJ Bean observes), but which, though it flowers, seldom produces more than a couple of fruit, or a hint of pink in the leaf.</p> <p>The alleged remedy for the deficient fruiting lies in the planting of a different clone alongside (but our new clone has yet to prosper and mature). The solution to the leaf-colour problem I do not know, only that every year (it is a dozen years old) the plant gets just a little better, as if manoeuvring for a second chance.</p> <p>Autumn leaves, I was reading the other day, are not dead. \"An infallible sign of the incipient demise of a plant is the wilting of its leaves, but the majority of autumn leaves remain stubbornly turgid right up to and beyond the moment of fall...\" What's happening in these leaves is \"an active and controlled senescence\", \"the most conspicuous example of phytogerontological events\".</p> <p>The glorious autumn colours that we are not, in the main, going to see this year (after the terrific gales of last week), are in fact a \"fast rewind\" of \"three billion years of plant history in a few short weeks\". What is happening is a large-scale reabsorption of plant proteins into the tree. So effective is this process that leaf-mould turns out to be a rather poor source of plant nutrients: the tree has taken back up to 60% of the available nourishment.</p> <p>The article I was enjoying, on the science of leaf colour, appears in the October issue of Hortus (<a href=\"http://www.hortus.co.uk\">www.hortus.co.uk</a>) and is by a retired microbiologist called Peter James. It is full of interesting facts and arguments attractively illustrated. Some plants, such as Viburnum opulus, turn red to attract the birds that will distribute their fruit. Poinsettia (which in Vietnam used to be called the Man of Genius Tree) is attempting to lure pollinating insects to its scarlet bracts. On the other hand, the crimson leaves of the American sugar maples are repelling aphids (which cannot bear red), at the time when the latter are looking for places to lay their eggs. Otherwise the young aphids would feed on the next year's early shoots.</p> <p>\"Evolution is irreversible,\" we are informed, and \"organisms are prisoners of their past.\" The comparison James makes, to illustrate Dollo's law, is what happens when we move to a new house with a mature garden. \"We generally want to transform the garden to our own tastes but are often loth to destroy a long established harmony by felling mature trees or interfering with imaginative plantings, and starting from scratch, so we compromise, working around a pre- existent structure. It was ever thus with evolution; chlorophyll-based photosynthesis is, biochemically, a very mature garden indeed. All the components, and there are many of them, are integrated, harmonised and exquisitely balanced.\"</p> <p>The beauty of a plant, seen as having its place in a whole world of plants, is like the beauty of a scientific argument, seen as part of a long chain of reasoning, taking us from the world of the archaea (bacteria-like forms dating from three billion years ago) to the plants we choose to cultivate today.</p>",

I am a Colombian student living in London and I have been reading the Review since I arrived here a year and a half ago. However, I was deeply disappointed when I read: \"Cali ... is the country's most violent city - more violent than Iraq\". I thought: not again, not in the Review. I am not saying that the article is not true or well written. Fonseca portrays a truly painful reality of my country, in a moving and clever way.

Dr Walker, who sadly died earlier this year, significantly contributed to Rochester scholarship with his 1984 edition of the Poems and relished the opportunity to share the pleasure of reading the earl's poems and plays; who could forget the gleeful obscenity of the \"Sodom\", whose dramatis personae include King Bolloxinion and his queen Cuntigratia? However, Keith showed us that there was more to the earl than four-letter words.

The king attempted to ensure that William's grounding in practical seamanship was enhanced and his manners reformed by packing him off to Germany to receive a scientific education.

  "<p>In his 60 years as a playwright, Arthur Miller surely has written better plays than Finishing the Picture; but in one special area, this new, second-rank work by the author of such prime American dramas as Death of a Salesman, The Price and The Crucible undoubtedly holds absolute sway. In its first run here at the Goodman Theatre of Chicago, it is stirring up more speculation, gossip and rampant curiosity than any Miller play has received in years.</p> <p>Neither a disaster nor a triumph, the production, which opened earlier this month, has been greeted with wildly mixed reviews from local and national critics, their assessments ranging from flat-out raves to unvarnished pans. Business at the box office, meanwhile, is brisk, and many of those who have seen the play feel compelled to talk about it, to rehash and review it on their own.</p> <p>The reason for all this ado is simple: the play is Arthur Miller writing about Marilyn Monroe. Forty-two years after her death at 36, and 43 years after her five-year marriage to Miller ended in divorce, the myth of Marilyn remains an endlessly fascinating subject in American culture. For Miller in particular his relationship with the screen's quintessential love goddess was crucial. Loth to talk about it in public, he has nonetheless dealt with it twice in his plays.</p> <p>He first explored its implications 40 years ago in After the Fall, which concerned, among other things, the disastrous marriage of Quentin, a fortyish attorney, and Maggie, a self-destructive singer terminally addled by drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>Finishing the Picture, his latest and probably last foray into that dark territory, takes place in Reno, Nevada, in 1960 during the filming of a motion picture that stars an unstable, deeply troubled actress (named simply Kitty) whose inability to show up for work has put the over-budget, over-schedule film project in jeopardy. In this time of crisis, various characters associated with the movie (but none of its actors) gather in a Reno hotel suite (sleekly designed in 1950s desert-modern style by Thomas Lynch) to see if they can rouse the actress from her druggy stupor and get her in shape to go on with the picture.</p> <p>These include Derek Clemson (portrayed by Harris Yulin), the flamboyant director; Paul (Matthew Modine), the actress's confused, despairing screenwriter husband; and Jerome and Flora Fassinger (Stephen Lang and Linda Lavin) two characters who wield tremendous influence on Kitty, Jerome as head of the prominent acting studio she has attended; and Flora, slavishly devoted to her husband, as the star's ever-present acting coach.</p> <p>The parallels between the play's characters and situation and the events surrounding the making of the 1961 movie The Misfits, which starred Monroe, with a script by Miller and direction by John Huston, are unavoidable. And the Fassingers, it is equally obvious, are directly modelled on the real-life Lee Strasberg, imperious head of the Actors Studio, and his wife Paula, both of whom were tightly bound with Monroe.</p> <p>Others meeting for the crisis conference are Phillip Ochsner (Stacy Keach), a former trucking firm executive turned movie producer who has the coolest head in this motley bunch; Edna Meyers (Frances Fisher), Kitty's shy, extremely protective secretary with whom Ochsner has started a mild affair, and Terry Case, the movie's earthy, wise-cracking cinematographer.</p> <p>Kitty herself (a brunette instead of a blonde, played by Heather Prete) is also on hand, but she is seen only fleetingly, in the nude, in the first act as an exhausted wraith who wanders into Ochsner's suite and in the second as a listless figure lying in the gloom of a bedroom while her assembled visitors try to get her up and moving.</p> <p>Kitty is the character on whom the play turns, but Miller has kept her silent and mysterious, at a distance, using her as a mirror or litmus paper in which the speaking characters reveal themselves. This is a daring choice and, in a stroke of great theatrical invention by director Robert Falls in the second act, it has its rewards. As Ochsner, Clemson, Paul and the Fassingers all troop up to Kitty's bed to plead with and manipulate her, their faces are captured by a hidden camera and projected in giant close-ups on to a skrim curtain at the front.</p> <p>More video projections - designed by John Boesche as silent, shadowy evocations of Misfits-like landscapes and images - are shown while scenes change. These devices add a slight kick to a mostly inert first act, in which the actors stand and deliver long stretches of explanation and exposition. Keach, as the decent, sane producer, and Yulin, fitted out in a Hustonesque safari jacket and speaking in gravelly voice, manfully carry the plot forward, while Glenn, adapting a strange, arm-swinging gait as he paces the stage, delivers the playwright's zingers on the people and process of movie-making. (He thumpingly asserts, for example, that Kitty's star quality lies in the perfection of her posterior.)</p> <p>But the play does not really come to life until Lavin walks in, kvetching and proclaiming, swathed in a voluminous black kaftan, lugging an immense tote bag and floridly airing herself with a large palm-leaf fan. Later, when Lang shows up, preening in his newly purchased cowboy dude outfit, these two sharply etched caricatures happily take over the stage. They are the most fully realised and deftly enacted characters in the drama, and they give the proceedings a neat bit of nasty, tabloid fun. Yet they're not total clowns. Miller gives them their dignity, particularly in their devotion to the majesty and mystery of acting.</p> <p>And Finishing the Picture, while it enjoys these wicked, funny moments, is deadly serious in the Miller mode. It concerns the terrible price of creativity in a tough, greedy world, and it pursues that theme from its very beginning, when the producer first notices the red haze of the forest fires burning out of control in the Los Angeles area. (\"The woods are burning,\" Willy Loman shouts at his time of anguish in Salesman.)</p> <p>What's missing here is something Miller has never been and never will be able to provide: the character of Arthur Miller. The writer Paul is a furtive and bland character, leaving the hapless Modine, a movie actor making his professional stage debut, with a sadly underwritten role. He does have one blistering scene in the second act, when he speaks of the love that turned to hatred in his marriage, and when he rips the bedsheet off Kitty and sets her screaming. But he is far less sophisticated and complicated than Miller, and without him weighing in as a strong character, the play loses a lot of heft.</p> <p>What happens to Finishing the Picture after it ends its extended run at the Goodman is still up in the air. It certainly has caused a mighty fuss in its performances at Chicago's largest resident theatre, and its starry cast, sparked by Lavin's performance, combined with the audience awareness of the Miller-Monroe links, might propel it to the Broadway production it was clearly set up to be. But with an unimpressive, dismissive review from the New York Times already filed, producer David Richenthal, whose collaboration with Falls has included profitable revivals of Death of a Salesman (1999) and Long Day's Journey into Night, (2003), must face the task of raising the money for the transfer of this new, flawed play to an unforgiving Broadway.</p> <p>For his part, Miller, who turned 89 in October, appears content with his work. Steadfastly denying autobiographical connections with his play and insisting that its characters stem only from his imagination, he seems finished with his writing now that it has hit the stage. Falls, the Goodman theatre's artistic director, says: \"Arthur was scared to death of the video images at first, but once he saw them, bless his heart, he went with it all the way.\" Otherwise, Miller, never one to go in for extensive rewrites, has left his script relatively untouched.</p> <p>Whether the play moves to Broadway or not, it is sure to have future productions, partly because of its subject matter, partly because, despite its longeurs, it still displays signs of Miller's keen stagecraft.</p> <p>And by no means is it the end of the line for major Miller productions. Already Richenthal is planning a May remounting for London of the acclaimed 1999 Salesman, which originated at the Goodman, with Brian Dennehy in the title role under Falls's direction.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Christiansen is the retired chief critic of the Chicago Tribune and author of the forthcoming book, A Theater of Our Own: A History and a Memoir of 1,001 Nights in Chicago</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Finishing the Picture is at the Goodman Theatre, Chicago, until November 7.

  "<p>Earlier this month, the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, Trevor Phillips, spoke on the BBC of something he called \"passive apartheid\", which existed in the British countryside. According to Phillips, it arose out of a kind of \"mutual incomprehension\" between white and non-white people when they encountered each other outside the much more racially diverse cities. He said: \"This [the passive apartheid] is not by anybody's will: there is no law and I doubt if anyone in the countryside wants to keep people out. But I think what we are seeing is a gradual drift towards a difficult situation in which people from ethnic minorities feel uncomfortable.\" </p> <p>I don't know what evidence Phillips has for his \"gradual drift towards a difficult situation\". In Britain, black and brown people have always been much sparser outside towns than inside them. Today, according to a recent report in the Guardian, the average for non-white citizens in the UK as a whole is one in 12 of the population; in southwest England they number only one in 85. Patterns of original settlement and kinship and occupation would explain most of that - and also, perhaps, that historic English dream of \"living in the country\" which is probably more potent among the white middle class (who have the money to achieve it) than among any other group, so that the movement from city to country is predominantly a white one. Rarity always commands attention. A man of Nigerian ancestry is bound to attract more curiosity in Devon than in Dalston Junction. But will there be more hostility towards him? Or any more now than before? </p> <p>Twenty-five years ago, I was married to a non-white woman. I can't and won't speak for her experience of racial abuse or racial difference. All I can say is that, as she related it, in London it was sometimes funny (drunken Irishman on the pavement outside Finsbury Park tube: \"Now what time would it be where you come from?\") and that, for me, the worst of it came in a field in Fife where a group of boys shouted at her to \"go back to the trees\". I hadn't expected it in the place I grew up, which was foolish of me. Perhaps, had my then wife appeared in that field in the 1950s, I would have been among a group of similar boys and shouted the same thing. I don't think so, but I don't know. </p> <p>One of the interesting gaps in documentary literature and documentary film is how \"ordinary\" British people have reacted to migrants, soon to be fellow-citizens, of a different colour. Thanks to a range of writers and diarists - from William Hickey to George Orwell - we know about white reaction to non-whites in their native places. Thanks to another range - from Indian travellers in the 1800s up to Niraud Chaudhuri, Naipaul, Rushdie and Andrea Levy - we have an idea of how non-whites found Britain. But the encounter inside this country from the white side is very rarely described. Perhaps it doesn't need to be and would be too shaming to read. Perhaps it really is just a matter of Enoch Powell, NO DOGS NO BLACKS on the boarding house door, and grainy footage of the Empire Windrush. My own feeling is that it is more complicated than that. </p> <p>The first black person I ever saw was on the Piccadilly line, somewhere near Hammersmith (I saw a rare London Transport steam engine outside the window just before or after) in 1951 when I was six. We'd come to stay with my granny and to see the Festival of Britain. The black man, who wore a smart suit, sat across the train's aisle and smiled at me. I think my father encouraged me to smile back. Perhaps I had been staring. That was that. </p> <p>The next year we moved to the village in Scotland where, so many years later, the boys in the field saw a brown woman and told her to get back to the trees. The term \"Scottish village\" has many connotations, almost all of them homely and almost all of them wrong. My village had been thoroughly mixed up by the conflicts of the 20th century. Nearby, there was a naval dockyard and an airbase or two, while the village itself held a small army barracks and a Royal Navy signal station. Many of the children I knew were raised - a puzzle to me then - by their grandparents. </p> <p>Here in the flat across the street from us lived my second black, or at least non-white, man: \"The Raja\". What did we know of him? That he was brown and robust-looking and cheery; that for a living he caught and cast off the ropes at the pier where the ferryboats came and went; that he lived with his daughter, Maggie (our popular postwoman), and his Cornish son-in-law Norman, and his grand-daughter, May, who played in the street with us. Eventually we also knew that he was from Malaya and had lived first in the village on the seashore in the \"Nestl\u00e9 Milk Huts\", so-called because their roofs were made of old enamel adverts for that brand of chocolate. </p> <p>The Raja was a very friendly man, especially towards ferry-boat passengers who in the summer included foreign tourists (it was said that he'd been round the world twice and could speak five languages), and it was thanks to his gifts in this department that our little street witnessed the most exciting event in its history. The Raja had encountered Malay's police pipe band on the ferryboat - it was around the time of the Edinburgh Tattoo - and arranged that the entire outfit, drummers and pipers and pipe-major and cooks, came to his very small council flat for lunch. I can still remember the big shining pans of rice, and uniformed bandsmen balancing plates of curry and trying to find somewhere to sit in the front garden. </p> <p>This week, thinking of Phillips's \"passive apartheid\", I rang May (who still lives in the same house) to ask about her grandfather and what it was like to grow up not-quite-white in a Scottish village 50 years ago. She spelt out his real name for me, Raja Mahamet, and said that he had come to England, perhaps to study medicine, but there married a girl from Norwich, which caused his family to disinherit him. Then he began to look for work. He'd sometimes spoken of a day or two he spent on the Jarrow march. </p> <p>She remembered his precepts: how courtesy was vital at all times and how she must forgive and forget insults because they came out of ignorance. Insults such as? \"I did get upset at times at school when people said: 'You're a Chinkie!' or 'Your grandpa's black!'\" </p> <p>I grew up in the same street as she and had either never known of these insults or had forgotten I'd heard them. Perhaps this is what Phillips means by \"passive apartheid\" - too little, rather than too much, curiosity about the others in your midst, so that their individual humanity never emerges and they remain strangers known by their colour. What is harder to believe is that it's worse now than it was, or threatening to become so. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ian Jack is editor of Granta</p>",
  "<p><strong> Frozen Billy</strong><br> by Anne Fine<br> 199pp, Doubleday, \u00a310.99 <br> </p> <p>\"I hated Frozen Billy,\" complains Clarrie at the opening of this Victorian adventure. Anyone who hates ventriloquists' dummies as I do, and who finds their relationship with their often creepy masters creepier still, will empathise with Clarrie. This particular dummy puts the sin into sinister. </p> <p>Despite this chilly theme, Frozen Billy is a warm story that will give no one nightmares. It uses the comfortable conventions of children's adventures: good people battling against an unfair world; temporarily absent (though loving) parents; and children who save the day, by being wiser than the feckless uncle who should be caring for them. </p> <p>The story's gentleness lies in the reader's absolute trust in the inevitable victory of goodness. With a father preparing an exciting pioneer life for his family in Australia, and a mother absent for reasons that never feel anything other than temporary, along with two children so sensible and inventive, hope beckons like an antipodean sun from every page. How could the reader doubt a happy ending? It's not a matter of \"if\" but \"how\" - though the \"how\" makes for some riotous storytelling. </p> <p>Perhaps, therefore, some tension is lost, but this will matter only to readers who want nail-biting thrills. Frozen Billy is more merry-go-round than rollercoaster, and refreshing for that. Tension doesn't always have to be stretched to twanging point. We suffer with Clarrie and her brother, Will, when Uncle Len doesn't pay Will his hard-earned money - but Anne Fine won't keep us suffering too long. We feel Will's pain as he begins to be taken over by the chilling character of Frozen Billy, but the pain never feels terminal. And we fear with Clarrie the loss of her brother's soul; but Clarrie's own strength reassures us, as if she were the adult and we the worried child. </p> <p>The Victorian setting naturally imposes constraints, but Fine deals with these deftly. One such comes from the music-hall setting of some of the action, as Uncle Len attempts to make his fortune with ventriloquism and then to keep hold of it further than the alehouse. An author's problem with music halls is that the jokes are, to modern ears, utterly dire. Fine bravely - or perhaps with a sigh of relief -deals with this by deliberately writing jokes that are, well, utterly dire. \"Do you play cards?\" \"No, we have too many cheetahs on the island.\" Actually, young children do laugh at jokes like this, so it works in a children's book, and for adults it works because we know that's what music-hall was like. </p> <p>In other ways, the Victorian background helps the story, for example by allowing the device of absent parents. Nowadays, a father abroad and a mother \"indisposed\" - not to mention a drunken uncle, truanting children and a young girl chatting to off-duty sailors - would be difficult to arrange without the serious interference of social services; but this is pre-Education Act and definitely pre-Children Act, so the device falls naturally into place. </p> <p>Of all the characters, it is Clarrie who remains with the reader. Her resilience and patience, combined with determination and independence, represent the best of the past and the present; the loyalty and courage which transcend generations, and the winning optimism of youth. If there's a message here, she is it. </p> <p> Frozen Billy is a charming story. The opening led me to expect something more sinister, but that may be my horror of wooden dolls that talk through clacking red mouths. If you share my fears, fear not - Frozen Billy is soft at heart. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nicola Morgan's Fleshmarket is published by Hodder Children's Books.</p>",
  "<p>When she was 17 and working six days a week at a lift-repair company, Grace Paley showed WH Auden some of her poems. She was taking a night class at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, where Auden was then teaching, and she was \"crazy\" about his work. They met in a nearby caf\u00e9, where he read through a handful of poems and then asked: \"But do you really use these words, Grace?\" Which words, she asked. \"Well, 'subaltern', for instance.\" Yes, she lied, sometimes. \"And 'trousers', not pants?\" Oh yeah, she said, we say trousers, too. Auden was friendly enough, even encouraging, but Paley went away feeling embarrassed. She had learned her her first lesson as a writer: don't imitate (they both knew she'd been trying to write \"in British\"); find your own voice; above all, be truthful. </p> <p>It was another 20 years before Paley was published; her first collection of short stories, The Little Disturbances of Man , appeared in 1959. In the meantime, she married, had two children, wrote 100 poems and worked on her writing voice, steering it away from Auden's England and rooting it more firmly in the Bronx where she grew up. Her poetry and prose, remarkablyconsistent through five decades of work, are tough and funny, exuberant and experimental, written to be read aloud. Above all, hers is the language of the women, men and children she grew up with - poor immigrants from the old world who were learning to get along in the new. </p> <p>If she has not published as much as she might have, it is only because, she has said, \"Art is too long and life is too short\". There have been three collections of short stories, published at intervals of 10 years or more, three volumes of poetry, and a book of essays, articles and lectures, Just As I Thought (1998). But at the same time, there has been a lot to distract her: husbands (two), children, students, the feminist movement of the 1960s and 70s, the Vietnam and Iraq wars. For the past 50 years she has been as committed to her political life as to her writing, and describes herself as \"somewhat of a combative pacifist and a cooperative anarchist\". </p> <p>The author Ali Smith, who cites Paley as a \"definite\" influence on her own short stories, believes that if she does not get the recognition she deserves outside America it is because \"she is about things that do not suit a high profile: the short form, the political everyday, the small survival (which is, actually, epic), the playful potential, the unsentimental hope. Like all great, great writers, she is uncategorisable. Her stories are specially compacted, primed to resonate, disconcert, and then force you, in a way that's somehow both gentle and extraordinarily tough, to be intelligent. They don't haunt; they preoccupy.\" </p> <p>For AS Byatt, who wrote introductions to two Virago editions of Paley's short stories: \"She is one of a kind. The only writer I ever compare her with is Alice Munro, who puts her stories together in the same way, crafting them from a mass of recollected and rearranged material into a form. But they are quite different. I do not think I have ever laughed so much over the joy of the inconsequential as I do listening to Grace in her writing. She reminds me also of my mother at her best, who told terrible stories deadpan, ironing out the awful and the banal into one string of story.\" </p> <p>Paley, now 81, lives in the village of Thetford in Vermont, a perfect piece of New England where everyone votes Democrat and recycles. The home she shares with her second husband Bob Nichols, a writer and former landscape architect, is a wooden house on a hill surrounded by silver birch forest. The living-room floor is stacked with poetry quarterlies, feminist and pacifist monthlies, and Paley's grandchildren's paintings. Nichols hammers away on a typewriter upstairs, while Paley, small and dressed in an oversized man's check shirt, makes soup in the kitchen. Earlier this year, she underwent radiation treatment for breast cancer and for some months was too weak to work; but she is now back at work, making frequent trips to New York and Washington DC, where she lectures and teaches creative writing. </p> <p>At 17, Paley never thought of herself as a writer. She had been writing poems since she was nine, but never imagined that what interested her might interest anyone else. Besides, she says, it was the 30s and her mind was on the Spanish civil war and the rise of fascism. \"I didn't give the future five minutes.\" To her parents' frustration, she dropped out of school at 15 with no real plan. \"I couldn't see myself doing anything, except hanging out, reading books, talking to people. I loved my two English classes and I wouldn't miss one for anything, but I was bad at math, stupid at economics. I just wanted to be on my own. At the same time I was crazy about children, and I wanted to run with the boys.\" </p> <p>She married at 19, in 1942. Her husband Jess was in the army, and for the first two years of their marriage they lived in army camps. She loved it; he hated it. Then he was posted overseas and for two years they saw very little of each other. After the war he trained as a film cameraman and the couple had two children, Nora and Daniel. (Nora is now a physiotherapist, and Daniel a schoolteacher.) Family life was hard work, and there was little time for writing. </p> <p>Then, when she was in her early 30s, Paley had what she calls \"the first of two small lucks\" as a writer. She caught a bad flu, which meant that the children had to be looked after between school and dinner for several weeks, but was well enough to sit at the kitchen table and write; in those weeks she completed two stories. Then, after the children came back, a third. The second \"small luck\" came some months later. Writing in the introduction to her Collected Stories (1994), Paley recalls: \"One dark day in our dark basement apartment, a father slumped in our fat chair, waiting to retrieve his two kids, my children's friends. Just before leaving with them, he looked at me. He said that his former wife, the mother of his children, had asked him to read my stories. I probably said, Oh you don't have to bother. But he did...\" The father, an editor at Doubleday, came back and said that if she wrote seven more stories like the three he'd read, he'd publish the book. </p> <p>When The Little Disturbances of Man came out in 1959, the New York Times welcomed \"a newcomer possessed of the comic vision\". Philip Roth went further, seeing in the collection an \"understanding of loneliness, lust, selfishness and fatigue that is splendidly comic and unladylike. Grace Paley has deep feelings, a wild imagination, and a style [of] toughness and bumpiness.\" Paley knew the stories were good - she had taken the trouble to write them \"as truthfully and beautifully as I could\" - but she didn't expect them to find an audience among writers and critics so readily. The Beats were big at the time, as was Henry Miller - male writing, which didn't spare a lot of thought for the daily concerns and experiences of poor immigrant women. </p> <p>As a collection, Little Disturbances is characterised by its great humour and energy. All life is here, and all life is speeded up: a couple might meet, marry and divorce in a sentence - and not, you feel, for rhetorical effect but because life moves that fast. Alternatively, a conversation might last 30 years. In \"The Pale Pink Roast\", a woman seduces her philandering ex-husband after meeting him in the park. When he realises that she has re-married, and that her husband is expected home any moment, he accuses her of seeking revenge. Honest to God, she says, I did it for love: \"'Love?' he asked. 'Really?' He smiled. In no time at all his cheerful face appeared at the door of the spring dusk. In the street among peaceable strangers he did a handstand. Then easy and imperious, in full control, he cartwheeled east into the source of night.\" </p> <p>But along with this sense of the abundance of human life, there is a recognition that it is these same things - love, lust, marriage, children - which trap us. In \"Two Short Sad Stories from a Long and Happy Life\", a mother begs her young son to go outside and play and so give her five minutes' peace, but the more she pleads, the tighter he clings. Giving in, she realises that this is what her love for him is - a kind of prison: \"I closed my eyes and leaned on his dark head. But the sun in its course emerged from among the water towers of downtown office buildings and suddenly shone white and bright on me. Then through the short fat fingers of my son, interred forever, like a black-and-white-barred king in Alcatraz, my heart lit up in stripes.\" </p> <p>Paley was born Grace Goodside in the Bronx. Her parents had emigrated to New York from Ukraine in 1905 (the family name, anglicised on arrival by immigration officials, was Gutzeit). In New York, Paley's mother, Manya, worked for a photograph retoucher, and her father, Zenya, a doctor, ran his own practice below their flat. In Russia, her parents had been committed anti-tsarists: her father had been imprisoned and sent into exile in Siberia, as had her mother. Paley's uncle, her father's brother, was killed at 17 for carrying the red banner of the working class at a demonstration (Paley recalls being told by her aunt never to carry a red flag at demonstrations). She grew up surrounded by Russian, Yiddish and American voices. </p> <p>Her mother died when she was 23, having been ill with cancer for more than 10 years. In an essay called \"Other Mothers\", Paley recalls overhearing adults talking about her mother's illness, agreeing that Grace should not be told. \"Thereafter,\" she writes, \"I devote myself to not having received that knowledge. I see that my mother gazes sadly at me, not reproachfully, but with an anxious look, as I wander among the other mothers, leaning on their knees, writing letters, making long phone calls. Then, for several years, we are afraid of each other. I fear her death. She is afraid for my life.\" </p> <p>The Goodsides were agnostic Jews, as were most of their neighbours. Paley remembers pitying a schoolfriend who wasn't Jewish, for being excluded from so much community and language. Later, she came to read Clarice Lispector, the Brazilian novelist, Isaac Babel, Kafka, Mordechai Richler, Carl Friedman, all of them Jewish, and realised that here were greater resonances than she found with American writers: she had been \"writing in Jewish\" all along. (Lispector's family, she discovered, had emigrated to Brazil from a village close to her parents' in Ukraine.) </p> <p>As a teenager in the late 30s she was only distantly aware of American anti-semitism. She recalls her mother sitting at the kitchen table reading a newspaper and saying to her father: \"Zenya, it's coming again.\" Today, she describes herself as a believer in diaspora and not nationhood - \"I was never a Zionist.\" </p> <p>She remembers her parents as tremendously brave, even heroic, though her mother was shy. They were socialists, but at the same time \"wildly anti-Russian. They loved the revolution but not what followed it\". Her mother was often embarrassed by what she saw as her daughter's refusal to conform: both parents were angry when she was suspended from school for signing a pledge against the second world war. \"In this country, they seemed to believe, education, once struggled for, came first - then socialism.\" </p> <p>She was a political child in a political family, but Paley says she became a committed activist around 1954, first within the anti-Vietnam war movement, and then the women's movement. There were marches and petitions and sit-ins, and in the 60s - Paley forgets which year - she spent six days in the Women's House of Detention in Greenwich, charged with civil disobedience at a military parade. (She had sat down in front of a horse.) Her cellmates, most of them prostitutes, were outraged that a five-foot-nothing housewife should be locked up for having political beliefs. But in an essay called \"Six Days: Some Remembering\", Paley writes that she only wished she had been allowed a pen and paper so she could write everything down. </p> <p>In 1969, she went to North Vietnam as part of an American delegation invited to accompany three PoWs home. The trip was a series of shocks: the Vietnamese delegates who said: \"It is not your per sonal fault, we know the great American people would not allow it if they had the power\" and quoted Whitman and Emerson at her; the American PoW who told her over dinner: \"Gosh Grace, to be truthful, I really liked bombing.\" </p> <p>In 1974, she made her first trip to Russia as a delegate to the World Peace Congress. It was an emotional visit - \"surrounded by the conversation of my childhood, three times a day in the dining room my bones nearly melted\" - but the Russian delegates were hostile to Paley's insistence that they issue a blanket condemnation of American foreign policy. They did not have the same access to information, they explained, or freedom of political expression. But in an essay about the trip, \"Conversations in Moscow\", Paley wondered what the First Amendment ever did for America: \"It has been pleasing to stand on the corner of Eighth Street and Sixth Avenue and hand out informational pamphlets, leaflets of protest, to assemble in rage a couple of times a year with tens of thousands of others. The elected or appointed leaders of our country have often applauded our enactment of these freedoms. They were then able (with clear consciences) to undertake and sustain the awful wars we spoke and assembled against for 10 years.\" </p> <p>Throughout the 50s and 60s, Paley was also trying to raise a family and write a second volume of short stories. Her publisher wanted a novel, and for two years she tried and failed to write one. \"It was so pedestrian,\" she says. \"I mean, it was OK, but there were so many things I couldn't figure out.\" She finds the idea of plot difficult. In the story, \"A Conversation with My Father\" (1974), the narrator argues against \"plot, the absolute line between two points which I've always despised. Not for literary reasons, but because it takes all hope away. Everyone, real or invented, deserves the open destiny of life.\" </p> <p>The author AM Homes, a former student of Paley's at Sarah Lawrence college, says, \"Grace is simply not a novelist. Not everyone is, and we're crazy to value the one over the other. Do we get mad at poets for not producing novels? Like Ray Carver, her work is so finely tuned it would be impossible to push into novel form.\" </p> <p>By the late 60s, Paley's marriage was over, although she says now she can't remember why. \"My husband was really a very nice guy.\" When they separated she remembers saying to a friend: \"'Mary, what was I so mad about?' and she said, 'Sit down Grace and let me tell you.' But even now I forget.\" Although it was not a factor in their break-up, he was less enthusiastic about children, and Paley has written about the (then illegal) abortion she had when her two children were small - mainly because she was exhausted, but also because children were \"very low on his list of priorities. He was just beginning his career.\" The abortion was \"a very clean and decent affair\" at a doctor's office in Manhattan, and Jess went with her. The doctor was arrested within the year and went to jail. Two years later she became pregnant again: this time she wanted the child. and Jess didn't. \"It was very hard; I didn't know what to do. I was kind of in despair.\" No doctor would perform an abortion. Then, in her second trimester, she bled for four days and finally found a doctor who was prepared to help her. In the late 60s, Paley helped organise one of the first \"abortion speak-outs\" in New York and has always been frank about her own experience. </p> <p>In 1972, she married Robert Nichols, whom she had met through the Greenwich Peace Center. Two years later she published her second collection of stories, Enormous Changes at the Last Minute . Again, they were dense, funny, passionate - and this time, more explicitly political. Faith, the single mother Paley created in the 50s and who is often - Paley says mistakenly - taken for an alter-ego, was back, along with her two sons, Richard and Tonto. But there was more war, more disturbing news from beyond the domestic sphere. In the story \"Faith in a Tree\", a group of mothers and children sit talking in the park when a Vietnam war protest comes by, carrying placards showing photographs of napalmed babies. In \"Samuel\", one of two stories based on real events, a boy dies on the subway, falling between carriages after someone pulls the emergency chord. In \"The Little Girl\", the most shocking of Paley's stories, a man narrates how a friend rapes and beats a 14-year-old girl in his room; afterwards she either jumps or is thrown down an air shaft and left to die. The story is also true, and was told to Paley by the narrator, a friend she met through the Southern Conference for Human Welfare in the 50s. \"There were a lot of runaways then,\" she says, \"and sometimes he would bring these girls to me and say, 'Put some sense in her head'.\" It is the one story she will never read aloud: \"I was driven to write it, but there are enough hard stories out there.\" </p> <p>Not everyone welcomed the new seriousness in Paley's work: the New York Times critic saw signs of \"carpentry\" in the stories, particularly the shorter ones, and blamed the \"change in American life between the 1950s and 1960s\". The 60s had been a noisy decade, he wrote, a time for action rather than the imagination, which did not suit \"socially committed artists like Mrs Paley\". </p> <p>But this distinction has always been a bogus one for Paley. \"The domestic and the political are the same thing for her,\" says Smith. \"The political is also domestic, part of the everyday work.\" This is not to say that the pull of one is not sometimes greater than the other. In the short story \"Midrash on Happiness\", Faith sets out the following conditions for happiness: \"She meant having (or having had) (or continuing to have) everything. By everything she meant, first, the children, then a dear person to live with, preferably a man, but not necessarily.\" She wants close women friends, long walks and intimate talks, a political life, work, food on the table, to be in love - \"the acuteness of the heart at the sudden sight of a particular person\". When her friend Ruth reminds her that the world is full of \"boom-boom bellicosity\" and no revolution, she says: \"I know all that. I do, but sometimes walking with a friend I forget the world.\" </p> <p>Paley's feminism grew out of her own experiences as a wife and mother. To start with, there was the fearlessness she learned from her grandmother, mother and older sister. But it wasn't until she had children that she really began to live among, and write about, women. \"I was pained by the peculiar life of the women my age - in their 20s and 30s,\" she writes in Just As I Thought , \"a lot of them with kids and a lot of them alone already, objects of considerable contempt but kind of tough, ironic, becoming angry; I'd begun to educate myself without knowing it.\" In an untitled poem from the 80s she sends up this dichotomy between the lives of men and women:</p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The women let the tide go out<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which will return <br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which will return<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the sand, the salt, the fat drowned babies<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The men ran furiously<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;along the banks of the estuary<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;screaming<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Come back you fucking sea<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;right now<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;right now </p> <p>Paley has been criticised by some feminists for putting motherhood, what she calls \"the mommy-and-daddy business\", so squarely at the centre of her work and world view. Reviewing Just As I Thought in the New York Times, the critic Ellen Willis argued that \"this brand of feminism - and humanism - works better as literature than politics; I don't believe that by virtue of our child-bearing capacity we have a special responsibility for children, a special talent for nurturance, a special connection with the earth or a special penchant for non-violence.\" Paley would counter that she writes from her own experience and is not making a universal case. She also reserves the right to change her mind, and says now that the importance society places on fatherhood is one of the great advances of our age. \"Fathers are more mothering these days, which is a wonderful thing,\" she says. \"They can enjoy their children, they are not so burdened by the responsibility.\" Homes says, \"She is the best kind of feminist - she loves men. And that's a wonderful example of how to believe in women, to support them, and to make a wonderful, happy life with a man.\" </p> <p>Paley published her third collection of short stories, Later the Same Day, in 1985. Faith is here again, although older and tougher, fighting battles with her father in his retirement home, and with her teenage sons, who have grown up cynical. The collection is funny, but also full of non-specific anxiety: how do you protect those you love, how do you keep the young from the more horrible truths, from \"falling onto the hard floor of man-made time\", how do you bear the death of friends? </p> <p>The exuberance of Paley's early work is countered by a greater sense of the responsibilities of life, and of the writer. In \"The Story Hearer\", she writes: \"I am stuck here among my own ripples and tides. Don't you wish you could rise powerfully above your time and name? I'm sure we all try, but here we are, always slipping and falling down into them, speaking their narrow language, though the subject, which is how to save the world - and quickly - is immense.\" </p> <p>For the past 20 years much of Paley's time has been taken up with lecturing and teaching. As a teacher she says her aim is to keep her students \"dumb\", to encourage them to write about those things they understand the least. Homes remembers taking Paley a draft of her story \"Looking for Johnny\" from The Safety of Objects . \"I couldn't figure out how it should end - a tale of a kidnapped boy. Grace read it, pushed it back across the table and said, 'Well obviously the kidnapper brings him back - he's not the right kid.' It was brilliant and dead on - she's not afraid to give her ideas, thoughts; she taught me to keep working on a story until I got it right.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year Paley was too ill to work, but now her desk is covered in drafts and notes; there is a poem about her mastectomy and on the wall a note: FOR THE NIGHT COMETH WHEN NO MAN CAN WORK. There is much about getting older that depresses her, she admits: she will never know how people will grow up or how certain world events will play out. She is perhaps less optimistic about life and human nature than she once was, although she has been encouraged by the scale of protest against the war in Iraq. </p> <p>When Paley was made New York State's first official author in 1986, Raymond Carver was on the selection panel.

The stories cut off too soon and you feel that if he had given them one more day things might have turned out alright.\" She has tried to give her characters that extra day, that last chance. \"Her stories give out such a sense of formal hope, potential, openness and dialogue,\" says Smith.

  "It would be possible to devote this column every week, instead of just occasionally, to readers' comments and queries about the Guardian's use of English. The concern for style and correct usage, a reader tells me, is one of the things (or should it be two of the things?) that he particularly likes about the paper. But ... What had irritated him on this occasion was a headline that read, \"Alistair Cooke's final collection [of his Letters from America] showcases his incisive and prescient commentary on the country he loved\". <p>\"The use of 'showcase' as a verb has frequently been used in your pages and the use of it in this particular context grates on the eye and ear because Alistair Cooke himself never failed to use the English language with precision in everything he said or wrote,\" explained the reader, who went to suggest that \"the simple verbs which could be used are: display, exhibit, reveal, demonstrate, or even simply show.\" </p> <p>He then offers a cautionary quote from George Orwell's description of Newspeak: \"Any word in the language could be used as either verb, noun, adjective or adverb ... By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary.\" </p> <p>This reader lives in Wirral, a point I mention, not to suggest that readers there are more pernickety about these things, but to make the point that he would have received an early edition. \"Showcases\" clearly grated on other ears because for later editions the heading became: \"Alistair Cooke's final collection continues his incisive and prescient commentary on the country he loved\". It was changed, presumably, not because it was wrong but because it was dissonant. We do not like it and we assume that Alistair Cooke did not like it either. </p> <p>As a verb, it is a relative newcomer to our vocabulary. It does not appear in the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, either as a word in its own right or in relation to \"show\", the entries for which occupy several pages. It does, however, appear in the supplement of 1986, where its origin is given as the United States, and its meaning as: \"To place in, or as in a showcase (chiefly figurative)\". Interestingly, the first quoted example of its use, in 1945, by HL Mencken, was pointing to an earlier existence. Writing in a supplement to American Language, and referring to the showbusiness magazine Variety, Mencken said, \"A few of its characteristic inventions will suffice: to ash-can, to angel, to showcase [etc].\" </p> <p>The first use cited from a British publication, quotes the Spectator in 1959: \"[The Festival Ballet] has show-cased any number of new performers.\" The Times, in a music review of 1961, noted, \"An album which introduces a new verb to the English language. It has been recorded to 'showcase' 10 different bands at a 'Jazz Festival in Hi-Fi'.\" </p> <p>Modern and more manageable Oxford dictionaries (the Concise, for example), list the word as a transitive verb able to stand on its own with no apology. Collins, the Guardian's default dictionary, does not qualify it as informal, and simply says: \"To exhibit or display\". </p> <p>The second edition of the Bloomsbury English Dictionary, just out, gives showcase: to \"present something to advantage, to present something or somebody in a way that is designed to attract attention and admiration\". So neat and clear is that definition that I am almost ready to start showcasing something. </p> <p>The Bloomsbury dictionary has a high browsing quality that might appeal to some of you, particularly those of you who write in with homophones. One reader wondered recently whether some electronic homophone alert could could be built into the Guardian systems. Something, perhaps (my suggestions, not his), that rang a bell, or turned on a light, or sent a mild electric charge through the journalist's seat. On reflection, there are so many words that would qualify that the newsroom would be lit up like a fairground. </p> <p>The Bloomsbury dictionary is pretty good in this area. Under \"reign\" it has a \"spell check\" note, \"See rain\". Under \"rein\" it says, \"See rain\". When we turn to \"rain\" the spellcheck note asks, \"Rain, reign or rein?\" Then it gives meanings and examples of use for all three. It is our kind of dictionary. </p> <p>Here's an endnote from a valued correspondent: \"I expect your complainers are all loyal readers who believe in the possibility of the eventual perfection of newspaper editors and journalists, if not the entire human race.\" </p> <p>I expect they are. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Thanks to Peter Dagley.

  "<p>Beeban Kidron is a one-woman brass band - all eyebrows and fiery gestures and sudden changes in tempo and delivery. Italics don't even begin to do justice to her emphases, her passion. Everything she says is delivered with more than conviction, with complete credibility. When I say brass band, I don't mean noisy - she isn't - I just mean that she is the kind of person you'd follow into combat, or down a mine.</p> <p>And that's one of a whole load of reasons that you wouldn't expect Kidron to have directed the second Bridget Jones movie, The Edge Of Reason. From the closing credits of the original, the sequel seemed all stitched up. With the cast assembled, the director a buddy of the writer, the writer a global success story, and blockbuster status for all of them, you'd think they'd just roll up their sleeves and start over again. Instead, they drafted in a director with the most flawless feminist pedigree, along with a history of political activism both inside film- making and out. </p> <p>Besides wondering what made them choose Kidron, more to the point is what made her choose them? Well, she has this pitch of persuasiveness that seems as if it comes from spending a working life trying to persuade people to part with 20 quid to make something that sounds unwatchable but is actually brilliant. What do you do with all that spare charisma when there's more money than you could shake a stick at and the film is so eagerly awaited that it probably doesn't even need adverts? This sounds as if I'm accusing Kidron of selling out, which I'm not, but if I were, she has rather a wry and unarguable answer to that one: \"From the moment I went to Hollywood for the first time, I was accused by various people of selling out. So I feel I've done my sell-out films already. I've sold everything! I've sold every piece of soul I ever had!\" </p> <p>Kidron's filmography is surprisingly short, considering how recognisable her name is - you always expect a director (or an actor, or anyone involved in the business, really) to have done two films, to every one you've heard of, that were forgettable, or rubbish, or straight-to-video. Kidron has, mostly, only done ones you remember: Carry Greenham Home, the documentary she made with Amanda Richardson about the women's peace camp at Greenham Common, which she began when she was 20; Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, the television adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's novel that swept the Baftas of 1991; Vroom, the above-average Brit flick that featured breakthrough performances by David Thewlis and Clive Owen; Antonia And Jane, the female buddy movie starring Imelda Staunton and Saskia Reeves; Hookers Hustlers Pimps And Their Johns, a startling documentary with a self-explanatory title; and Murder, the 2002 TV drama starring Julie Walters. Indeed, the only spider in the ice cream is the disappointing Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert clone To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar, in which she got Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes into frocks. </p> <p>And that's pretty much it. Kidron nods vigorously, mercifully unoffended by what is essentially a really rude question. \"Yes, I wish I'd made more films. I wish it was easier to make films I'm interested in. My taste is very, very broad, but the quality, I'm only interested in a certain level of quality. And Bridget is part of that, for me. I think you can sort of look at this slightly odd CV that I have and see where Bridget fits in. It's been the Antonia [And] Jane, To Wong Foo strand, the more comedic of my work. I think it is a great gift to make people laugh, and it shouldn't be underestimated. I mean, I don't mean my great gift [laugh, eyes, fireworks], I mean a great gift in the community.\" </p> <p>Bridget is a very funny film. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who has been billed since Nurse Irene as the comic actress of her generation, does more than flex her comedy muscles. Here, she flexes them, and then picks up a huge big truck. You could say that about the first one, too, but there's more meat to her this time (no, no, I don't mean the weight-gain thing; the scale of weight-gain has remained the same). Hugh Grant, given more of an unambiguous bad guy role, is able to do comic malevolence in a way that few directors allow him, since they never want to waste his peerless romantic hero shtick. The smaller roles are way more carefully tended, and laugh-out-loud jokes are slipped in at the end of scenes, rather than announced with a big fanfare - this film has enough funny gags that it can sprinkle them about like hundreds and thousands. </p> <p>Kidron is naturally keen to give all the credit to Helen Fielding, Zellweger (\"She's actually a thoroughbred actress, is what she is\") and Grant. She goes so far as to have a bit of a moment over Colin Firth: \"I've walked down the street with Madonna, and I've walked down the street with Colin Firth, and it was a little bit more ... with Madonna they were a little rougher, but they were all there for Colin. It was amazing. Women adore him. They swoon. Anyway. Stop. If I say anything stupid, you have to cut it out.\" </p> <p>But aside from how well the others did their jobs, it's clear she did hers so well because she attacked it with absolute fervour. This wasn't a film taken on by someone who needed a new bathroom - put it that way. Kidron isn't a trainspottery Bridget Jones aficionado - she makes no claims to being the first to discover how funny it was, or being able to quote whole chapters of the oeuvre, but equally there's no part of her that feels as if she's ... not dumbing down, exactly, more unfeministing-down (can I get away with that?) in having taken on the project. \"I remember when the first one came out, and this guy on the telly attacked the movie on really pseudo-feminist grounds, you know, that it makes women stupid, it saw them only in relation to their men. I remember turning on him and saying, 'You're wrong. You're wrong. No one thinks of Laurel and Hardy as stupid, or Buster Keaton as denigrated. It is a metaphor for how we feel, it's a realisation of our fear of how we're going to behave.'\" </p> <p>She makes no outlandish claims for the importance of this film, but does insist that, in its way, it is radical. It's radical because its heroine isn't perfect, she isn't graceful, she isn't chaste or even particularly monogamous, and she isn't thin. That last is what everyone fixes on, but the rest is, in the context of what is expected of female leads by mainstream Hollywood and so many other branches of the media aimed at women, just as important. \"Now, I don't say it's broadly radical, and I absolutely can see how you could put it in a cultural context and say it is shoring up a number of things, heterosexual, blah, but you know what? The world is so far gone, and women are under such a lot of pressure ... You have a choice in the mainstream media of saying a little thing to a lot of people, or a great many things to many fewer people. It is very, very rare that you can do both.\" </p> <p>Kidron views it not with derision but with amused bafflement. \"I had breakfast with one of my more intellectual friends - I mean, properly intellectual, a very, very famous man in the world. I was in the middle of shooting, one day off, and he said, 'And how is she doing? I hear she ate 13 doughnuts in one day.' I was absolutely stunned. And I went, 'Antony Gormley O ... B ... E! I cannot believe you are concerning yourself with what Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has for breakfast!' I was flabbergasted.\" </p> <p>You'd think, with a sequel, that people would get bored with such a surface detail, but no - everyone still talks about Zellweger's phenomenal eatathon as though she'd been forced to give away a kidney for the sake of her art. I suppose this reinforces Kidron's point that, at this particular time in the trajectory of images of femininity, a message as simple as \"It's OK not to be skinny\" is radical, and will continue to be, until more people make it, and more often. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it's probably still not the film Kidron thought she'd be making 20-ish years ago when her first film, Carry Greenham Home, came out. She was still at film school when she made it - indeed, had just gone along for the weekend to try and figure out how to use a camera and ended up staying a year. \"Literally, night and day, night and day. I had my 21st birthday at Greenham, by the fire, chanting. It was one of my better birthdays. And I think I had a New Year's Eve going over the perimeter fence. It was one of my better New Year's Eves.\" </p> <p>Kidron is uncharacteristically not-that-modest about this venture, which I think is because it's so long ago that she sees it as part of the time, rather than part of her work: \"It was a huge, huge act of protest and politics and rage at what was going on in the world. But it was still funny, it was still touching, it was still a version of a documentary, and that's always been my interest. How do you speak to the many? And how are you - not in a compromising sense, but in the most positive possible sense - the acceptable face of what they do not understand or will not tolerate?\" </p> <p>Having said that, she doesn't hold much with self-effacement, certainly not the half-meant, simpering kind, and I think it would be impossible to have been politicised in the era that she was, without winding up way too bolshie and full of vim to affect a \"don't mind me\" stance about anything. Besides which, it is a brilliant documentary, vivid and funny and sincere to a degree that is actually a bit depressing, since it reminds you that the most you ever see about important protests now is when Ali G goes down to take the piss out of them and ask why they don't have more baths. It reminds you, also, how polarised people used to be about things like this, how a great many people saw nothing at all worthwhile, or worth listening to, about peace protesters, and normal-looking Greenham locals went round with angry faces and badges saying RAGE (Residents Against Greenham ... I can't remember what the E stood for. Maybe eejits). </p> <p>As distinct, easily, were the battle lines drawn around Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit. It's easy to forget the context of this, along with the reaction it drew. Plus, the tragic early death of its lead actress Charlotte Coleman bathes it in nostalgia, rather, and puts it on a cultural par with the children's television series Marmalade - something of which everyone was immediately fond, and remains so. </p> <p>But this was a time when there were only four channels, and everyone was watching one of them, and the only way to opt out of cultural debate would be not to watch telly at all (whereas now you can just watch Friends all the time). It was also long before the first lesbian kiss on Brookside, before gayness was even a twinkle in the eye of EastEnders, and a good 10 years before Coronation Street caught up. The first scene of same-sex intimacy on British television is what gave it its shock value, and Mary Whitehouse wasn't alone in her crazy talk of depravity. The BBC wasn't too keen on it, either. \"I remember that when the executive producer, I can't remember his name, Michael something ... but not Grade [eyes flash with prospect of amusing identity mistake]. Definitely not Grade. But anyway, he stood up, and he said, 'Well, that's not very BBC, is it?' And he walked out, and that was his contribution.\" </p> <p>It was phenomenally successful in the mainstream, with all the Baftas and such, and also won every gay and lesbian film-making award going, but Kidron's standing as a resolutely radical and campaigning director, on this front, is complicated. To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar, starring all those quintessentially straight big shots, garnered some serious-minded critiques for not going far enough, not using any gay actors, not showing the reality of being a transvestite in small-town America, all those boxes it would have ticked if its aim had been exclusively political. </p> <p>As is probably clear by now, Kidron would rather be somewhat political and somewhat mainstream than very political and not mainstream at all. She talks about films \"doing their job in the world\". When she pantomimishly claimed to have sold every bit of soul she had, it was underpinned by a more serious rejection of the academic/arthouse path through culture, which guards its purity very closely but doesn't reach an awfully large audience. \"All these things are cultural conversations. You want to be part of it, you don't want to leave it to everyone else. 'Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I'm doing something terribly right on.' I'm not that interested in that. I think we have a broader palette.\" </p> <p>In terms of her personal politics, she says she's the kind of person who seems terribly political to the outside world, but who, in the context of her Marxist upbringing, isn't political at all. She isn't the same creature, politically, as the one who made Carry Greenham Home. \"The world has changed so much. And my relationship with it has changed so much. I'm older, and I'm a mother, and I've been through many and various life experiences. I lost my father. I'm even married, which I never thought I would be. There are many, many things that have changed my relationship with the world.\" </p> <p>And, for half a second, that all sounds like a roundabout way of saying that hoary old Churchill thing about being a socialist until you're 30 because you've a heart, and a conservative afterwards because you've a brain. But, of course, that's not what she's saying at all. \"I've been very encouraged by the numbers of young people gathering around the anti-globalisation thing. It's not all thought through, but it's pretty anarchic and it's pretty fantastic and it's pretty loud. And the huge movement against the war, which, of course, should have been heeded, and which, of course, Blair is a criminal to have turned his back on, is also encouraging because, in this time in which we lack community and lack a structure and lack a political education, here is the largest street demonstration in history. So you've always got to look to the facts ... there are very stupid movies, with very stupid women in them, but there are also very intelligent movies, with very intelligent women in them. There is despair about international politics and a despair about domestic politics, but there is a proper, vibrant opposition, and it's not around traditional party lines.\" </p> <p>I love the way women in films keep bobbing back up as she talks, regardless of the subject; it's a million miles away from the crass, keep-plugging-the-product stuff you get sometimes when you try to draw a filmy person away from the film. A project can consume terribly energetic, terribly passionate people to the extent that all conversations dovetail with it, at least for a time. Kidron had Bridget Jones absolutely right - it is not the most groundbreaking film ever made, but it breaks enough ground, and it's all done so expertly and charmingly you wouldn't want it to go further. </p> <p>\"So long as I haven't dropped the crown jewels, so long as people think that their Bridget is safe, so long as people know it's still OK to have a big arse and say the wrong thing and not be able to live up to this or that - all these expectations of what being a woman is - and they will still find romance and love and happiness, and all the things you want in a good life, then I've done my job. And maybe if the world was some other world, then it wouldn't be enough, but, right now, I think it's important. I don't want to be grand, but I think it's a little bit important.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason is released on November 12.</p>",
  "The last time they met on screen, Omar Sharif was a small dot riding out of a desert mirage to join Peter O'Toole, the dashing and rebellious British army office TE Lawrence. Now, 42 years after the release of Lawrence of Arabia, widely hailed as one of the greatest films ever made, the two veteran actors have teamed up for a second time to make another historical epic. <p>One Night with the King tells the story of the Biblical figure Esther, who became the queen of Persia, and, according to myth and movie, saved the Jewish nation from annihilation. Although the story unfolds in present-day Iraq and Iran, for obvious reasons the producers of the $16m (\u00a39m) epic have chosen to shoot their film in north-western India. </p> <p>The veteran stars, both now 72, must be hoping that their new venture does not entail the hardships they endured the last time they worked together. \"Omar Sharif and I spent nine months in the desert, day after day for nine months,\" O'Toole said in an interview in the Guardian last year. \"In Arabia, on the spot where it all took place. We were 400 miles away from water. We lived in tents.\" </p> <p>On location, O'Toole decided to call Sharif \"Fred\". \"No one in the world is called Omar Sharif,\" he said. \"Your name must be Fred.\" </p> <p>While that collaboration between the two actors resulted in an Oscar for best picture, the prospects for One Night with the King may not be so bright. Lawrence of Arabia, directed by David Lean, fresh from his success with The Bridge on the River Kwai, had a stellar supporting cast - Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains - and a Robert Bolt screenplay. </p> <p>One Night with the King features former Bros star Luke Goss as King Xerxes and Tiffany Dupont as Esther. It also features Lord of the Rings stars John Rhys-Davis and Noble, and Indian actor Aditya Bal. The script is based on a novel by Tommy Tenney, and the director is Michael Schaeben. </p> <p>But the new film's producers, 8X Entertainment, who made The Omega Code, are hoping some of the lustre from actors' last encounter will rub off on the new film. \"Having motion picture legends Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif starring on the same bill only adds to the film's overall mystique,\" publicist Susan Zahn said in a press statement. O'Toole will play the prophet Samuel in the film, while Sharif takes the role of Prince Memucan. </p> <p>Lawrence of Arabia turned the Irish-born O'Toole and the Egyptian Sharif into international stars. Sharif had previously only appeared in Arabic films, but went on to star in Doctor Zhivago in 1965. He has not looked back, subsequently appearing in some 80 films, most recently starring in this year's Hidalgo. </p> <p>O'Toole, who got the part of Lawrence because of his performance in a small role in the British film The Day They Robbed the Bank of England, made the most of the opportunity to play the charismatic Lawrence. Although the part was originally offered to Albert Finney, and Marlon Brando was rumoured to be in the running, O'Toole, with the support of Lean, made it his own. </p> <p>Noel Coward remarked after seeing the film that if they had made O'Toole any prettier it would have to be retitled \"Florence of Arabia\". But the epic provided the cornerstone for a career that has seen O'Toole make close to 80 films. </p> <p>At the time of the 1962 original release, however, critics were divided about his performance. The Monthly Film Bulletin was not convinced he could hold the ambitious, three and threequarter hour film. \"O'Toole's performance, likeable, intelligent and devoted, lacks that ultimate star quality which would lift the film along with it,\" wrote the journal's critic. But the Guardian disagreed, singling out O'Toole for a \"brilliant\" performance and crediting him with portraying \"with total credibility all the contradictions\" of Lawrence. </p> <p>Lawrence of Arabia, concluded the Guardian's critic, \"threatens to degenerate at times into another epic. But O'Toole, never quite lost, always returns to remind us just in time of poor, great Lawrence\". </p> <p>Last year O'Toole returned to the historical epic in Troy, a big-budget Hollywood spectacular that failed to live up to its billing. O'Toole, who has never been one to temper his opinions in public, said this week of the film, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, that he had thought it a disaster. </p> <p>\"Ugh, what a disaster. The director, that kraut, what a clown he was,\" O'Toole said at the Savannah film festival in Georgia. \"When it was all over, I watched 15 minutes of the finished movie and then walked out.\" </p> <p>One Night with the King is due to be released on March 25 next year, to coincide with Good Friday and the Jewish feast of Purim. </p> <p><b>Two lives on screen</b></p> <p><b> Omar Sharif</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Born</b> Michel Shalhoub, April 10 1932, in Alexandria, Egypt.

  "A video shot nine days after the fall of Saddam Hussein has provided powerful evidence that large quantities of explosives missing from Iraq's al-Qaqaa facility vanished after US forces had seized control of the country. <p>The dispute over the missing material, which has overshadowed the final days of the US presidential campaign, looked certain to grow fiercer as a result of the footage. It was released by KSTP, a Minnesota television station affiliated to ABC News that was embedded with the 101st Airborne Division in the early days of the Iraq invasion.</p> <p>Several large barrels marked as containing explosives are clearly visible on the videotape, which also shows US soldiers cutting through what appear to be seals used by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to secure the munitions.</p> <p>The 101st was not given instructions to secure al-Qaqaa, leaving the facility apparently unguarded as troops were ordered on to Baghdad. The presence of the IAEA seals \"means that what's behind those doors is HMX\" - the explosive at the centre of the controversy - the former United Nations weapons inspector David Albright told ABC.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said yesterday that it repeatedly gave occupying troops detailed information about \"massive stockpiles of unsecured explosives and munitions located throughout the country\". But the troops \"took little or no action to secure the stockpiles\".</p> <p>The IAEA has said that more than 350 tonnes of explosives disappeared some time after April 9 last year, the day the regime fell.</p> <p>Yesterday, the former commander of the US unit that reached al-Qaqaa complicated the picture by saying that his forces had removed and destroyed 250 tonnes of ammunition themselves. However, the ammunition involved was not under IAEA seal and it remained unclear if the destroyed quantity was part of the missing batch.</p> <p>Either way, the development seemed to contradict the position of the Bush administration, which has repeatedly maintained that the explosives were more likely to have been removed by Saddam's forces.</p> <p>\"We had total control of the air. We would have seen anything like that,\" Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, said in an earlier radio interview. \"So the idea that it was suddenly looted and moved out - all these tonnes of equipment - is, I think, at least debatable.

  "<p>Eurotunnel is to cut the regularity of its shuttle services through the Channel tunnel, in a move which could involve mothballing several of its unique trains, as it struggles to compete with cut-price ferry operators. </p> <p>The heavily indebted company's French management team yesterday published an outline of Project Dare - a rescue plan which centres on streamlining the business and is likely to include hundreds of job cuts. </p> <p>Among the proposals are airline-style yield management in which fares rise as trains fill up, a priority system allowing its 50 biggest freight customers to jump check-in queues, and an end to the tunnel's \"permanent cycle of promotional activity\". </p> <p>However, Eurotunnel's chief executive, Jean-Louis Raymond, warned a meeting of the firm's works council that the measures would not be enough to put Eurotunnel in a stable financial position by the end of next year, when interest payments on its \u00a36bn debt mountain are scheduled to soar. </p> <p>\"These measures alone will not be sufficient to safeguard our future beyond the demanding challenge of the next two years,\" said Mr Raymond. \"In reality the financial structure of the group remains fragile and the high financial charges continue to impact on operating results.\" </p> <p>Eurotunnel's 16 shuttle trains operate 10 services an hour at peak times. A further 10 slots through the tunnel are used by third party operators such as Eurostar, SNCF and EWS freight trains. </p> <p>Passenger numbers on Eurotunnel's shuttles have fallen by a quarter since 2000 and the firm's market share against ferries has slipped by 5%. </p> <p>Eurotunnel conceded yesterday that its commercial strategy was \"unsuited to the present state of the cross-Channel transport market, which is in decline and highly competitive\". Reports in the French media have suggested that 500 of Eurotunnel's 3,100-strong work force could lose their jobs. </p> <p>Mr Raymond's management team was installed in April following an unprecedented coup by grassroots shareholders, who voted out the previous British-led board at an acrimonious annual meeting. He has set a target of increasing Eurotunnel's operating profits by \u00a370m within three years. </p> <p>Project Dare will form the basis of a business plan which is due to be put before Eurotunnel's bankers this weekend. Creditors have warned that, if they are not satisfied by the strategy, they will initiate moves to take control of the company. </p> <p>A source close to Eurotunnel's consortium of lending banks said: \"We will of course be looking at this plan in detail.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's announcement had been scheduled to take place on Thursday afternoon. Eurotunnel refused to comment on claims by industry sources that it had been delayed by boardroom disagreements. </p> <p>The Transport &amp; General Workers' Union said it was \"obviously concerned\" at the prospect of redundancies but added: \"If this is going to secure the long-term future of the company, we will be positive.\" </p> <p>Eurotunnel's shares, which stood at 37p when the new board was elected, fell 1p yesterday to 18.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Who is the number one enemy for the motoring public? Is it Ken Livingstone, with his congestion charge? Or the big oil companies, with their soaring petrol prices? Or could it be Bob Macnaughton, the boss of Britain's biggest parking company and the man behind \"zero tolerance\" enforcement? </p> <p>Macnaughton's firm, NCP, is best known for its 600 car parks with their lurid yellow and black neon signs. These have been synonymous with parking ever since the company's founders, Ronald Hobson and Sir Donald Gosling, began buying up derelict bomb sites in London after the second world war. </p> <p>These are merely the public face of NCP. The company's fastest growing business is in so-called \"on-street enforcement\" for local authorities. In 30 towns, cities and boroughs from Brighton to Durham, NCP employs the uniformed traffic wardens who ticket, clamp and tow away illegally parked cars. </p> <p><strong>Traffic hotspots</strong></p> <p> A lean, tanned, former geologist, Macnaughton has become the butt of criticism for alleged over-enthusiastic ticketing - particularly in London, where 5.9 million motorists were hit with parking and bus lane fines last year. NCP's contracts include Westminster, Camden and Islington - three of the capital's most congested traffic hotspots where parking can cost 20p for three minutes. </p> <p>\"Yes, I do get stressed in this job,\" Macnaughton admits. \"But the thing that probably stresses me most is unbalanced criticism. I get very upset about the way a lot of things are covered and portrayed. I passionately believe we have to provide a fair service and if I thought we were treating people unfairly, then I would not accept it.\" </p> <p>The days of the yellow-capped, centrally employed traffic warden ended in 1994, when the government decriminalised parking offences and allowed local authorities to take control of enforcement from the police. Most metropolitan authorities have since contracted out enforcement to private firms - which Macnaughton says is inevitable, given the greater efficiency of the commercial sector. </p> <p>\"Local authorities' prime responsibility is setting policy,\" he says. \"Where they actually deliver services, they commonly struggle.\" Parking enforcement, Macnaughton maintains, is largely about the supply of manpower. He boasts that the average NCP employee takes fewer than seven days' sick leave annually - half the rate in the public sector. Outsourcing is a controversial business - rival firms such as Capita and Serco have turned in huge profits but have faced robust criticism where schools or social services have come a cropper. </p> <p>For NCP, Macnaughton accepts there is similar hostile scrutiny: \"In our own way, we do attract lots of controversy, albeit that it's more about lots of little stories than a few big scandals.\" </p> <p>The list of notorious incidents involving private contractors is endless. There was the rabbit hutch which got ticketed when it was left on a yellow line outside a pet shop in Eccles. The hearse which was targeted while funeral directors collected a body in Edinburgh. The bus which got a ticket while waiting at a bus stop in Manchester. Or the hard-hearted Lambeth parking attendant who slapped a penalty charge on a mangled scooter while its injured rider was being lifted into an ambulance. </p> <p> Macnaughton insists that most such tales are distortions. He cites a story about an NCP warden slapping a ticket on a fire engine attending a blaze in Westminster last year. In fact, Macnaughton says, the vehicle was a fire authority van and the inferno had been extinguished at least 30 minutes earlier. </p> <p>\"The van was parked in contravention of the law,\" he says. \"The PA even phoned his base to check what to do. It's a grey area but technically, he should have ticketed it.\" </p> <p>So what about Graham O'Keeffe, the Soho milkman who complained that he had received 40 penalty tickets in six months while doing his rounds? </p> <p>\"Dairy Crest has paid every single one of those fines - it's never protested one of them,\" Macnaughton replies briskly. \"There are plenty of places he could park legally to serve his business. It will just necessitate him having to walk ten yards further.\" </p> <p><strong>Big bonuses</strong></p> <p> What gets up the nose of many mild-mannered motorists is ticketing for tiny, technical infringements. Legally, a few inches of bodywork protruding from the end of a parking bay merits a fine. So does sloppy parking more than 50cm from the kerb. </p> <p>\"These things may happen occasionally but the frequency is minuscule,\" says Macnaughton. \"But if somebody is clearly causing an obstruction, or if they are preventing another bay from being used, then they should be booked.\" </p> <p> Among the most contentious aspects of private enforcement are the rewards on offer for zealous ticketing. NCP's attendants all have individual targets ranging from six bookings a day in the quiet streets of Durham to 20 in central London. </p> <p> At a corporate level, NCP can earn big bonuses for raising more cash for councils in parking fines. In London, its contract with Islington council requires NCP to clamp 21,017 vehicles a year and to tow 9,450 to the pound. If it falls short, it faces penalties starting at \u00a386,000. </p> <p>A spokesman for the local authority, which earned \u00a35.2m from parking last year, said allowing attendants discretion to turn a blind eye to marginal offences would only leave them vulnerable, as drivers argue about inconsistency: \"Most of the attendants are black and there's a huge amount of racial abuse. It's possible that would be increased if tickets were at the discretion of the warden.\" </p> <p>Macnaughton says he \"discourages\" councils from setting targets for ticket numbers, accepting that they go down badly with the public. A new model contract developed by the government with private contractors rejects ticket targets in favour of rewards for staff retention, deploying the right number of officers and keeping spoilt tickets to a minimum. </p> <p> Ultimately, Macnaughton says NCP has had to accept targets for issuing tickets in a minority of its contracts: \"We do not go out there seeking such contractual arrangements but we have to bid for contracts in an open market and the clients dictate what those contracts comprise.\" </p> <p>To the horror of motoring organisations, NCP's local managers in Westminster awarded a cup every month to the base which ticketed the most cars - a policy which critics claimed had prompted a frenzy of false and unjustified penalties. The company's contract in Westminster was rewritten this year after a furore over the excessive enthusiasm of its wardens. </p> <p>\"I do strongly believe in having performance recognition schemes but if it were to do purely with the number of penalty tickets issued, that would be inappropriate,\" he says. </p> <p>Confrontations with angry motorists can prove challenging for a workforce typically earning \u00a36.75 per hour. In an effort to persuade officers not to simply turn their backs and walk away, NCP is sending many of them on \"charm\" courses run by the police. </p> <p> When faced with an irate driver, Macnaughton says his staff should \"explain very clearly why the motorist has got a ticket and what they can do about it if they feel it's unfair\". He adds: \"The challenge they often have is trying to get a word in edgeways.\" </p> <p> Of Britain's 24.5m cars, an estimated 23m are parked at any time. Parking has become a huge industry - it has its own trade body, the British Parking Association, which even sponsors an annual awards ceremony (categories include \"best park and ride\", \"best new car park\" and \"best on-street enforcement\"). </p> <p> The number of independent adjudicators handling appeals has shot up from four to 80 over the last decade. One angry writer, the Financial Times chairman Sir David Bell, recently compared the privatised industry to the poll tax in attracting public discontent. </p> <p>Macnaughton never intended to be a parking professional. Brought up in Essex, he had a childhood enthusiasm for rocks. After training as a geologist, he spent the early years of his career as an engineer on drilling projects in Conwy Bay and Poole Harbour. </p> <p>He soon began to regret his choice of direction: \"The turning point came when I spent a month drilling on a spoil heap in Wrexham in February. It was freezing cold and I was having all sorts of disputes with a surly, burly bunch of north Welsh drillers. I thought there had to be a better job than this.\" </p> <p>He opted instead for finance, joining Ernst &amp; Young as an accountant. After helping to restructure Canary Wharf, he ended up working in Sainsbury's corporate finance department and was headhunted to join NCP as finance director in 1999. </p> <p><strong>Fitness enthusiast</strong></p> <p> At the time, NCP was owned by the American corporation Cendant, which had bought the business from its founding duo for \u00a3800m. It was sold again to Cinven, the venture capital firm, for \u00a3900m in 2002. Cinven is likely to look for an exit, possibly through a flotation, within the next three years. </p> <p> While on-street parking is on the up, NCP's central London car parks have been suffering from the impact of Ken Livingstone's congestion charge. The company has closed several sites and has cut its prices elsewhere. </p> <p>\"There are fewer cars coming in,\" says Macnaughton. \"There's too much capacity now for parking in central London which is why it amazes me that people have to park illegally all the time. </p> <p>\"Time has become such a precious commodity that people are more likely to take a risk. They're desperate to park right next to where they want to go - whether they're picking their dry cleaning up or getting a coffee.\" </p> <p>A fitness enthusiast, Macnaughton has run the London marathon three times. He recently cycled up Britain's three peaks - Snowdon, Ben Nevis and Scafell - in aid of the NSPCC. </p> <p>Macnaughton's Hemel Hempstead home does not contain a television, to the chagrin of his two children. He drives a 5- series silver BMW and owns up to three parking tickets in his life - all \"a fair cop\". As the owner of a pass for all of NCP's car parks, he does not need to park on the street very often. </p> <p>So how conscious is he of being the personal object of ire for frustrated drivers? \"We do get letters of complaint - but not that many,\" he says. \"In fact, I'd say we probably get as many compliments as complaints.\" </p> <p> Occasionally, however, he does get cornered at dinner parties: \"Yes of course they relate their personal experiences. But it's interesting - you explore them and it doesn't very often seem that they've been harshly treated. They've usually done something wrong and got a ticket.\" Bob Macnaughton, the man motorists love to hate.

  "On the 20th floor office in Toyko that Japan's foreign correspondents call home, veterans of previous big earthquakes exchanged worried glances. Only one - an Italian - did what we were supposed to do and huddled beneath his desk. <p>The block swayed to the accompaniment of the sinister sound of creaking concrete, a sound which is never forgotten. One hundred and fifty miles away in Niigata prefecture, 30 died and tens of thousands were left homeless, but Tokyo escaped unscathed that night. It might not be so fortunate next time. </p> <p>The capital lies in one of the most quake-prone areas of a country that accounts for a fifth of the world's powerful earthquakes, those of magnitude 6 or above on the Richter scale. In 1923, the last time a major earthquake hit Tokyo, more than 140,000 died as neighbourhoods of wooden houses collapsed or burned to the ground. </p> <p>Most of today's Tokyo is made of sterner stuff, with modern structures designed to withstand the impact of fairly powerful earthquakes. </p> <p>There the reassurance ends. There is a 70% chance of an earthquake of Richter magnitude 7 striking Tokyo within the next 30 years. </p> <p>That is about the same strength as the 1995 quake in Kobe which killed more than 6,000 people. In Tokyo the toll would exceed 7,000 with 160,000 injured. More than 140,000 buildings would be destroyed or badly damaged. </p> <p>The implications are too awful to contemplate. Just about every political decision is made here, and the local economy accounts for 17% of Japan's GDP. </p> <p>The Niigata quakes have at least proved that the government is better prepared than it was nine years ago, when whole neighbourhoods of Kobe were left to burn while officials in Tokyo debated the political pros and cons of sending in the armed forces. </p> <p>Offers of help from abroad were turned down, even as people were being pulled out of the rubble. The homeless turned to the city's well-organised mafia for emergency food, water and clothing. By contrast, Japanese troops were quickly on the scene in Niigata, airlifting stranded villagers and distributing relief supplies. </p> <p>But hospitals in the mainly rural region were unprepared for the deluge of injured. Tens of thousands of people still face shortages of food, medicine and clothing, evacuation centres lack heat, and there is a shortage of temporary toilets. </p> <p>Fewer than half of Japan's 130,000 schools - which are turned into evacuation centres - are capable of withstanding a big earthquake, and 14m ageing wooden homes need reinforcement. </p> <p>In Tokyo, where more than 1.6m homes were built before 1981, residents of traditional wooden homes would form the bulk of the casualties in a major quake, according to experts. Subsidies exist to bolster such structures, but they cover a fraction of the estimated cost of 1.9m yen (just under \u00a310,000) per home. </p> <p>Potentially the biggest problem is complacency. Every September, Japan's 124 million citizens are reminded to check their homes for signs of decay and to prepare a survival kit, including bottled water, candles and matches, a torch and a radio. </p> <p>Few heed the advice. </p> <p>Their nonchalance is understandable. Before 1995, they were told the chances of a major earthquake hitting Kobe were as low as 8%. Why prepare for a disaster, when no one can predict its timing, location or intensity? </p> <p>As inhabitants of an archipelago that shifts, on average, once every five minutes, most Japanese do not spend much time mulling over the prospect of a catastrophe. </p> <p>While their fatalism is alarming, there is little to be said, either, for living in perpetual fear of the Big One. That said, last week's quakes will have many households dusting off their survival kits - that is if they can remember where they put them.</p>",
  "<p>The political storm descending on the gambling bill obscured a landmark moment this week for another odd government gambling measure. Royal assent was granted for privatisation of the Tote, and Trevor Beaumont, a veteran of 27 years at the bookmaker Coral, was named chief executive. </p> <p>All that remains to be decided is the price, which is where this tale gets interesting. The Tote is being sold to a proposed Racing Trust, together with a seven-year monopoly on pooled betting. For all the government's insistence that the price will be set at \"fair value\", the figure of \u00a3150m is the only one to have gained currency. </p> <p>Such a price would be a steal. The Tote these days has 457 high street shops, many in locations envied by the likes of Ladbrokes and William Hill. What is more, the business made operating returns last year of \u00a328.7m on turnover of \u00a31.47bn. Bankers suggest its true value is probably closer to \u00a3500m. </p> <p>The supposed justification for selling to a Racing Trust, a body of racing interests, rather than to an ordinary trade buyer, lies perhaps in the Tote's origins. The organisation was established after the first world war to help the struggling racing industry raise money - and indeed the organisation still returns a large slug of its profits to the sport each year. </p> <p>But the Tote has travelled a long way since 1929, as anybody who has visited one of its shops will know. Like Billy Hill and the rest, the Tote has cluttered its premises with roulette machines which the industry coyly calls fixed-odds betting terminals. These highly profitable machines have nothing at all to do with racing, which prompts the question as to why a sport populated by sheikhs and other wealthy individuals should be sold the Tote at a knockdown price. </p> <p>There is no economic justification whatsoever and the taxpayer would be a direct loser. It is the task of PricewaterhouseCoopers to determine fair value for this business. The accountancy firm risks being a laughing stock if it comes up with a price tag of anything less than \u00a3400m. </p> <p><strong> Credit limit </strong><br> </p> <p> Ask Robin Ashton, chief executive of Provident Financial, to explain his business of peddling credit to Britain's social underclass and he'll be at your elbow in a matter of hours. Certainly, if you are a member of parliament or a representative of the media, you are there to be lobbied. </p> <p>The Provy and its close rivals such as Cattles, S&amp;U and London Scottish Bank, who together control about 70% of the doorstep lending or \"home credit\" market have a serious public relations battle on their hands. </p> <p>Regulators, including the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, are all over this sector after the National Consumer Council launched a so-called super-complaint in the summer, charging the industry with anti-competitive practices, milking some of the most vulnerable members of our society in the process. </p> <p>Mr Ashton's defence is simple and seductive enough: the seemingly huge rates of interest attached to Provident Financial's lending are spuriously compared with mainstream credit providers, without taking any account of the penalties and extra charges which poor borrowers tend to attract when using credit cards and the like. </p> <p>What's more, if the government regulates the transparent, above-board home credit industry out of existence, its place in the human financial food chain will be filled by something much less desirable - and which, by definition, will exist outside governmental control. </p> <p>Yet any rational analysis of what is a very sensitive social issue gets blown away by cases such as Tony and Michelle Meadows, who this week were lucky enough to find a judge who agreed that a \u00a35,750 debt that mutated into a \u00a3384,000 court demand transgressed \"ordinary principles of fair dealing\". </p> <p>Mr and Mrs Meadows can count themselves very lucky. Thousands of other problem debtors have simply been ordered to pay up - and we must hope the Meadows's case sets a precedent. </p> <p>Mr Ashton, meanwhile, may be able to claim that his company never takes enforcement action against struggling customers. But it remains the case that the entire credit industry - all the way up the chain, including names such as American Express - is complicit in allowing a shadowy underworld of commission-driven debt recovery agents and bailiffs to thrive on people's misery. </p> <p>Month in, month out our award-winning Jobs &amp; Money supplement reports cautionary tales of naive borrowers allowing their financial liabilities to spiral out of control, leaving themselves vulnerable to the extraordinarily unfair imposition of huge court-sanctioned penalties. Yet the people who actually drowning in personal debt are usually beyond reading the personal finance pages. </p> <p>It is at this unsavoury margin - where unscrupulous recovery agents bully people into borrowing elsewhere to meet existing debts and where bailiffs are allowed to ratchet up mind-boggling charges in their pursuit of settlement - that government action is needed. Urgently.</p>",
  "The commander of the Israeli forces that invaded Tulkarm in March 2002, Colonel Moshe \"Chico\" Tamir, had an unusual idea. His staging of the surrender of the town's fighters to the Israeli army seems to have been inspired by his recollection of Gillo Pontecorvo's celebrated 60s film The Battle of Algiers. The TV crews invited to document the occasion were confronted with the familiar image from the film of militants climbing out of their hiding places with hands raised, as the paratroopers marched into the casbah. But the artistic-minded officer seems not to have watched that movie to the end: for although the French won the battle, they lost the war. <p>The 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Algerian liberation war against France falls on Monday. On November 1 1954 the the FLN (the Algerian National Liberation Front) broadcast its proclamation calling for the \"restoration of the Algerian state\", coordinated with a series of armed attacks on French targets. The then French minister of the interior, socialist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, responded that \"the only possible negotiation is war\". Eight years of bloodshed later, the Evian agreement paved the way for Algerian independence. </p> <p>Israel, sinking ever deeper in its own colonial adventure in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, could learn some vital lessons from the Algerian experience. Although there are important differences between the French-Algerian and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, the similarities are striking - from the scenes of paratroopers in the casbahs to the popular racist phrase \"a good Arab is a dead Arab\" to the promise of \"a million martyrs\", which all featured in both cases. But important analogies lie beyond such anecdotes. The most inflamed dispute in Israel today is over the issue of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories and whether Israel is prepared to significantly dismantle the settlements. The settlers' threats of violence against Israeli soldiers who might try to evacuate them, and their claim that their uprooting would be an \"illegal transfer and a crime against humanity\" lead many to question whether such an evacuation is possible. The French-Algerian case supplies a simple answer: when the government is willing to implement such policies, they can work. </p> <p>The French settlers - the \"pied-noirs\" - had been in Algeria since the 19th century. France treated it as a province, rather than a colony, and the assertion that \"Algiers is as much a part of France as Provence\" echoes Israeli attitudes to the West Bank and Gaza, although (East Jerusalem apart) Israel never annexed the territories it occupied in 1967. Generations of French settlers were born and bred in Algeria, and when their homes were threatened, they formed militant underground groups, exchanged fire with French soldiers and even attempted to assassinate Charles de Gaulle. But when the government decided to accept Algerian independence and evacuate the occupied land, its million settlers packed their bravado as well as their bags, and home they went. </p> <p>Of course, the French settlers in Algeria did not share the deep religious bond some Israeli settlers feel for the biblical landscape of what they call \"Judea and Samaria\". But most Israeli settlers, who were lured to the West Bank and Gaza by government mortgages, grants and cheap housing, have no such sentiments. Underneath the rhetoric of the settlers' unelected leaders, the attachment of most settlers to their homes resembles that of the French settlers in Algeria, and a government determined to end the occupation, along with offers of proper compensation, would bring them back into the legal boundaries of Israel proper. With the right strategy, the small messianic minority would be left isolated. </p> <p>Another crucial lesson of the Algerian war is the futility of using military force to try and crush a popular uprising for national liberation. The French in Algeria, like the Israelis today, used increasingly brutal methods in their efforts to keep control: collaborators were recruited, suspects tortured, houses demolished. Just like Israel, France tried to present itself to an increasingly impatient international community as a victim of terror. When resistance grew, France also resorted to violent \"crackdowns\". </p> <p>The French response to the FLN rebellion was based on overwhelming force and the Algerian resistance were temporarily defeated. In 1957, French general Raoul Salan also resorted to the construction a security wall on the Algerian borders with Morocco and Tunisia. But the French military victory could not be translated into political success, and just increased popular support for the FLN. Some Israelis argue that the French used even more brutal measures in Algeria. Yet besides being illegal and immoral, these methods simply did not work. </p> <p>Victory in the Battle of Algiers did not make occupation any more sustainable. It did, however, scar the French collective consciousness for generations. \"The moral corruption of our own society by occupation\" which Israelis complain about, had far-reaching implications on French culture and society, and the debate over it is still ongoing. Algeria got its independence, as will Palestine. The question, now as then, is only one of costs, in resources and lives, to both Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p> There are also conclusions that Palestinians might draw from re-examining the Algerian experience. Humility is advisable for anyone who tries to comment on an occupied nation people's liberation strategies - particularly those from the occupying state. But devastated contemporary Algeria, torn between the corruption of the ex-FLN leadership and Islamist fundamentalists, could be said to have its roots in the fight for independence, when Algerians attacked French civilians in restaurants and on buses. Algerians, like the Palestinians today, argued that terror against civilians was their last resort. \"Give us tanks and aircrafts and we'd abandon terror,\" said the FLN leader Ahmed Ben Bella. Terror, in both cases, was of course not used only against the other side's civilians, but also against their own, when the hunt for collaborators became the pretext for much internal violence. </p> <p>But the price for ruthless violence is exacted from the occupier and the occupied alike. Algerians took the culture of terror deep into independence. Preparing for independence demands not only a fierce fight against the occupiers, but also a vision of a viable society and system of government after liberation. This is not to say that Palestinians should take at face value the preaching about democracy and corruption directed at them by Israeli and US politicians. George Bush and Ariel Sharon are role models for neither equity nor democracy, but other liberation movements may supply a few hints. The African National Congress's adherence to minimum violence against civilians in its struggle against apartheid did not only help win international support, but also laid the foundations for a healthier post-liberation society. </p> <p>The Palestinians were inspired by the FLN's example of how a poorly equipped movement could beat a superpower. But if the success of the Algerian liberation struggle could be an inspiration, post-liberation Algiers is a warning sign. </p> <p>There is however one crucial difference between the French-Algerian and the Israeli-Palestinian experiences; the French, after soul-searching, could simply leave and never look back. Such unilateral disengagement is exactly what most Israelis seek. Yet the Israeli fantasy of locking the door on the Palestinians and never seeing them again is a delusion. Israelis and Palestinians are doomed by history, politics, economics and geography to have their lives and futures intertwined. Instead of a sea separating the two peoples in the wake of a two-state settlement, there would be the closest intimacy, and Jerusalem and the refugees would remain potentially explosive even in the most optimistic scenario. </p> <p>Which is why the two sides might learn from another recent anniversary: this year marked a decade since the achievement of majority rule in South Africa, where a truth and reconciliation commission exposed past atrocities in way that aimed to lead to reconciliation, and sustainable coexistence.That is the direction we should also take in the Middle East. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ron Dudai is a research fellow in the Hotung programme in law, human rights and peace-building in the Middle East, SOAS; Daphna Baram is author of Disenchantment: The Guardian and Israel </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:daphnun@yahoo.co.uk\">daphnun@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",

  "Lisa Johnson made the same trip I did. But while it has taken me a month to get from Boston she and her husband drove down in just three days. It was 1980, she was 28 and he had landed a job in the booming oil industry in Midland. <p>\"I thought I was coming for one year,\" she says. \"That was the agreement. All the way through Texas I was fine. But when I came into town and saw all the oil tanks I just started crying. It was pretty ugly and you could smell the oil.\" </p> <p>If you cannot find a way to love oil - the industry that produces it, the environment that it scars and the money that it makes - then you will probably never find a way to love Midland. </p> <p>Rising from the West Texas desert like a small Gulf state, your entrance to the town is flanked by restless, bobbing, pumping jacks and vast shrubland pockmarked with derricks. </p> <p>Along with Odessa, it's poorer, even uglier sister city 16 miles away, Midland sits in the heart of the Permian Basin - a 1000-mile platform of sediment and salt with a slab of rock on top that is home to one fifth of the country's oil reserves. Between them they boast more than 2,000 firms involved in the oil and gas industry. </p> <p>And according to United States president, George Bush, if you don't find a way to appreciate Midland then you will struggle to find a way to appreciate him. </p> <p>\"I don't know what percentage of me is Midland,\" he once said in an interview, \"but I would say people, if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland and the attitude of Midland.\" </p> <p>The percentage matters. Mr Bush was not born here but in New Haven, Connecticut. Nor does he live here now. When he is not in Washington DC, his home is 330 miles away on a ranch in Crawford, also in Texas. </p> <p>In fact, his relationship to Midland is quite episodic. He came here as a two-year-old, attended the Sam Houston elementary school and then San Jacinto junior high (both state schools). He returned 16 years later in 1975 and married a local woman, Laura Welch. In 1987 he left to help his father on his presidential campaign and has only returned to campaign and visit friends and in-laws. </p> <p>\"He was viewed as an outsider,\" says Jim Brown, a geologist who did business with Mr Bush in the 80s. \"Midland has embraced him as a native son now because he was governor of Texas and now he's president. But back then, to the few people who knew who he was, he was just a rich Yankee kid.\" </p> <p>His Democratic challenger, John Kerry, has a stronger claim to Boston, where he has lived and worked since he returned from the Vietnam war. But while Mr Kerry holds Boston at arms length, lamenting the fact that he \"moved around a lot\" as a child, Mr Bush holds Midland in a bear hug. </p> <p>He has written the city into his personal story as though its mores were seared into his soul. \"There's a West Texas populist streak in me and it irritates me when people come out to Midland and look at my friends with the utmost disdain,\" he told Texas Monthly. When he dies, he says, he wants to be buried in Midland. </p> <p>To his critics these are just more examples of Mr Bush's bid to shed his blueblood background. In 1978 the Democrat Kent Hance inflicted the only electoral defeat Mr Bush has ever suffered, largely by portraying him as a carpet-bagging, Ivy League Yankee. </p> <p>Mr Bush learned his lesson well. But Mr Bush certainly has an emotional claim to the place. Midland is where Mr Bush found a wife, God and gave up the bottle. </p> <p>In 1969 the cultural geographer DW Meinig described Midland as \"the purest example of white Anglo Saxon Protestant culture in Texas\". One of the last cities in the country to desegregate its elementary schools, today it is almost 40% black and Hispanic. </p> <p>But while the colour of the inhabitants may have changed, many of its customs have not. On Friday nights thousands pack the local Grande stadium for high school football. On Sunday mornings they go to church. It's a no-nonsense place where, during the 80s, business was often concluded on a handshake. \"People here are generally friendly,\" says John Nute, who runs a cafe in Wall Street. \"But there's an edge to that. One of the first questions you're asked when you come here is, what church do you go to? If you're answer is one they don't like then you never see them again.\" </p> <p>Oil and money may dominate, but one in eight of the city lives in poverty, most of them quite literally on the wrong side of the rail tracks. \"I doubt he even knew those places existed,\" says Midge Erskine, who knew Laura Bush's mother. \"It's a very segregated town. Over the years the town's ambivalent self-regard has been reflected in its changing slogans. They have included: \"Midland: In the Middle of Somewhere\"; \"Midland: Most Ambitious City Between the Oceans\"; and recently, \"The Sky's The Limit\" - a slogan from the 70s when the oil prices were so high that loan officers needed permission to turn you down - has been revived after Mr Bush said it encapsulated the Midland he knew. It's not difficult to see why Mr Bush would want to mythologise both the town and himself in this way. </p> <p>What is more baffling is that he has managed to get away with it, given that Midland was the site of his most conspicuous failures to date. </p> <p>He set up an oil business, Arbusto, which failed. He ran to represent the area in Congress and lost. By all accounts he had plenty of chances, did not work hard and never succeeded at anything much. \"He used to come into meetings still hung over and you'd see him fall asleep,\" says Mr Brown. \"Then when it was over he'd kind of jolt up and walk out with his team.\" </p> <p>But the nature of each setback and the manner in which he recovered are themselves revealing. Mr Bush is no self-made man. His father arrived in the early 50s and used the finance capital from his family to make millions. </p> <p>When Mr Bush arrived as a young man, 20 years later, his father was a former Congressman and ambassador, soon to become the vice-president. And in Midland connections are everything. \"If a Harvard MBA came to Midland without connections he wouldn't be able to raise the kind of money Bush did,\" says Mr Rosen. </p> <p>But while connections could provide Mr Bush with the money he needed it was not enough to guarantee him success. His father's picture hangs in the Petroleum Museum's hall of fame, but his will not be there any time soon. </p> <p>Mr Brown says Mr Bush's plans were flawed because they were based on \"poor science\". But the firm Mr Brown worked for invested in the projects anyway. </p> <p>\"It was a way of funnelling money to the Bushes without looking like it. His expertise was socialising.\" </p> <p>What is most remarkable about Mr Bush's relationship with Midland is that, despite the fact the he achieved so little, drank so much, lost an election and a lot of other people's money, pretty much everybody liked him. </p> <p>\"You never walked away from George Bush thinking he was a rotten individual,\" says Mr Brown. \"You thought he was your friend, your pal, your chum.\" </p> <p>In other words Midlanders liked him, not because of what he had achieved, but regardless of what he had not achieved. On Tuesday we will see if America will feel the same way.</p>",

  "Lena Samuels, a freelance broadcast assistant and presenter at BBC Radio Solent, can't stop saying nice things about her computer. Phrases such as \"pretty good\", \"quite impressed\" and \"easy to interact with\" keep tripping off her tongue. <p>But while Ms Samuels, 42, from Lymington in Hampshire, is in danger of giving information technology a good name, for most of us the terms \"frustrating\", \"stupid\", and \"unfriendly\" are likely to come closer to the truth. </p> <p>Although around three quarters of us now use information communication technology at work, there is little proof that the PC on our desk has improved the quality of our working lives. </p> <p>\"The evidence is, that as ICT has spread, job satisfaction has gone down, people have got grumpier and organisational commitment has fallen,\" says Max Nathan, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy and Research. </p> <p>Ms Samuels' experiences of the BBC's Gateway intranet shows that it doesn't have to be this way. In a recent intranet benchmarking competition, it came out top when compared with those of 16 other organisations including Alliance &amp; Leicester, Orange and Bupa. </p> <p>\"Two years ago, when we took over Gateway, it was seen as so awful Greg Dyke wanted to close it and start again,\" says Professor Nigel Paine, head of people development at the BBC. </p> <p>\"Only about 18% of staff used it regularly. I persuaded him what was really needed was to get the thing organised and focused on users.\" </p> <p>Two years on, Mr Paine says Gateway usage has soared, and the BBC's 27,000 staff rely on it for everything from booking hotels and claiming expenses, to checking editorial policy and carrying out audience research. </p> <p>And it seems to be catching on fast. The number of learning module users increased from around 20,205 in 2002 to 36,013 in 2004, up 78%. </p> <p>One feature is \"learning journeys\", explains Mr Paine. This allows people to find out what skills they require and what courses they need for a particular job. In this way they can prepare themselves and are \"far more likely to get an interview.\" Other features include \"360 degree feedback\" which allows your line manager access to your personal development plan. </p> <p>Oonagh Jaquest, a content producer at White City, says she used learn.gateway \"a lot recently\" to brush up on her interview skills. In the past she has used it for courses on managing difficult people and project management. </p> <p>\"It is very, very accessible. It's nice that it personalises your training record, both face to face training and online,\" she says. \"And it allows you to go back to things when you have time.\" </p> <p>However, its impact goes far deeper. As Mr Paine says: \"John Birt said ... 'there are no careers in the BBC, just jobs you can apply for'. </p> <p>\"That had a massive impact in terms of people thinking the place didn't really care about them. Learn.gateway was a deliberate attempt to try and change that and say, 'We value you. There are careers in the BBC'.\" </p> <p>Gateway must be seen in the context of a BBC that is changing fast, he says. \"We need people to have broader experience, be much better at multi-tasking, and understand what the rest of the BBC does.\" </p> <p>In the past, people came into one department and usually stayed there, he says. There was a \"silo mentality\", where making sideways moves was seen as \"almost impossible. Learn.gateway helps create that sense of a BBC community, regardless of geographical location or actual job.\" </p> <p>The system is helping to develop a climate where staff are encouraged to move around. \"It gives people a greater sense that you can change jobs, and it is ok.\" </p> <p>According to focus groups, Gateway has also helped staff to find the jobs they wanted, and improved job satisfaction by making day-to-day tasks easier and faster. </p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" agrees David Bradley, a senior people development adviser from Swindon. \"It makes my job very user-friendly.\" </p> <p>Mr Paine admits that cost is a key driver. Not only did it allow him to meet tougher budgetary conditions by getting rid of 60 staff, but training say 6,000 journalists online, is between four and five times cheaper. </p> <p>Ms Samuels says it has allowed her think about the next stage of her career, \"rather than staying in a rut\". </p> <p>\"And it has made me do something about it,\" she says. \"In that respect, I think it is a good motivational tool. If I were comparing it to old-style methods of training and development, I would say this far outstrips it.\" </p> <p><b>Less paper, more control</b></p> <p> Mark Claydon, a risk and internal control manager at BBC White City, found learn.gateway - one of the most popular sites - \"by accident\". </p> <p>Now he wouldn't be without it, and uses it to set and record his career objectives and to choose appropriate training courses. These are then added to his personal development plan. </p> <p>\"It is a move away from paper, which drives me mad,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Everything is there in one place. It provides a good holistic view of career planning. I feel more in control.\" </p>",

  "<b> Who are they? </b> <br> Alba Life is largely made up of endowment policies sold by Britannia Building Society and other lenders over the 1980s and 1990s. <p>It was known as Britannia Life until 1999 when it was taken over by Birmingham-based Britannic Assurance (no relation to Britannia). </p> <p>Its former Glasgow operation has been moved to Birmingham. It also includes policies sold under the FS Assurance, Life Association of Scotland and Crusader Insurance labels. Additionally, there are a few unit-linked plans which go up and down in line with investment market prices. </p> <p> <b> How many customers do they have? </b><br> Around 220,000 and declining by the day. </p> <p> <b> When did they close to new business? </b><br> Britannia Life stopped selling in 1998 ahead of selling the firm. Britannic, whose own funds slumped, pumped in extra capital in 2003 \"to support Alba's solvency, bonus and investment policy\". This added to the woes of Britannic investors whose fund is now also closed. </p> <p> <b> What are the past performance figures? </b> <br>Dire. No bonuses have been paid since 2001 - and that was just 1.1%. Alba is one of the very worst closed with-profits funds. One Jobs &amp; Money reader who contacted us this week has paid Alba \u00a311,171 over 14 years at \u00a366.71 a month into her 25-year plan. The current surrender value is \u00a39,704, an annual 2.36% loss despite strong investment growth since 1990 when this policy was sold. </p> <p> <b> How steep is the surrender penalty? </b><br> Very. The current value of the policy payable on death is \u00a322,986. Therefore, the escape penalty equates to 57.8% of that sum, again one of the very highest in the closed funds arena. </p> <p> <b> Will future performance be any better? </b><br>Probably not. Closed funds have no incentive to improve. Instead, the fund is in bonds, cash, and some property - safer investments designed to meet death claims and minimum guaranteed maturities rather than boost the fund. There are no equity holdings, so any share market recovery will pass Alba investors by. It will probably struggle to make 4% in long-term growth after costs. </p> <p>Based on the above policy, the payout should be at least \u00a322,986 if payments continue - a 3.89% annual return over the endowment's life. It could stretch to \u00a324,500 - a 4.25% return. Returns are complicated because each of Alba's predecessor companies has had its own terms and conditions as well as differing bonus rates. </p> <p> <b> What should I do if I have a policy? </b> <br> First, check if you have an endowment mortgage mis-selling case. But if that fails, whatever you do will be painful. Unless you are close to maturity, you could be throwing good money after bad. </p> <p>It could be worth taking the surrender hit - in the worst cases, policies may be stuck at current levels even if you continue to invest. </p> <p>You might be better off investing future monthly sums into a cash Isa - current interest rates are in excess of anything you are likely to earn from Alba. You could use the surrender value to cut your home loan and reduce your monthly outlay. </p> <p><b> How do I contact them? </b><br> Send policyholder enquiries to: Alba Life, 1 Wythall Green Way, Wythall, Birmingham B47 6WG. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money wants to find out what is happening to these \"policies in purgatory\". They often won't tell us - so we need your help.

  "Ken Hunter, who has died aged 82, was a Jamaican singer and instrumentalist who, during half a century in Europe, helped sustain a community of musicians from across the African diaspora. He also provided the vision behind one of Britain's best-loved vocal quartets. <p>Born in Port Antonio, he started out as a tailor. He spent the war years in Panama, returning when Jamaican labour was no longer required, carrying an alto saxophone. He returned to meet Jamaican ex-servicemen back from Britain, and although he joined Jack Brown's band in Kingston, playing saxophone was not enough. Inspired by the returnees' stories, he joined the exodus from the islands. </p> <p>He travelled to Europe on the Almanzora with a group of migrants, arriving at Christmas 1947, unheralded and six months before the Empire Windrush. Enroute, he discussed the future with the singer Allan Wilmot, a Royal Air Force veteran and friend. As they assessed the possibilities of a new life with music at its centre, they formed an image of themselves, strong and confident enough to sustain them on uncertain terrain. </p> <p>But, on arrival, the newcomers were forced on to their individual resources. Hunter's saxophone found him nightclub and stage work, but it was as a singer that his fortunes changed, replacing an ailing member of the vocal group, the Plantation Four. Headlining the show was pianist Norman Thomas, an African-American veteran whose European career predated the war. Working with such professionals showed Hunter the potential for a group of black singers. </p> <p>He persuaded Wilmot and his brother Harry to join him in a vocal quartet, and when this became a trio, they drifted between London and Paris until French labour restrictions forced the Wilmots to remain in Britain. There the brothers reformed as the Southlanders, one of the most successful vocal groups of the era. And although Hunter never sang with them again, Allan Wilmot pays tribute to him as \"the start of it all\". </p> <p>In Paris, Hunter established himself as solo act. He was not really a jazz singer although his supple baritone could handle jazz when the occasion required, and so he worked there with the Count Basie trumpeter Buck Clayton, then back in England, with the big band of saxophonist Ronnie Scott. Other gigs followed with Jamaican alto saxophonist Joe Harriott and drummer Phil Seamen, before he joined the commercial big band of drummer Eric Delaney. </p> <p>In the late 1950s, he moved to Scandinavia where, now a singing drummer, he provided a focus for a variety of hardy musical refugees. Black musicians were still a novelty there and, especially in the frozen north, his band members were the first people of colour some natives had seen. Playing Sweden's folk parks with musicians from Nigeria, the Caribbean, the United States and South Africa, the only criterion for inclusion in Hunter's roadshow was an ability to handle all styles - calypsos and waltzes as well as jazz and rhythm and blues - with tangos a favourite in Finland. His ever-changing sidemen included the lyrical Barbadian trumpeter Harry Beckett, Leroy Anderson, the bass-playing father-in-law of Bob Marley and, honing his revolutionary vision away from home, tenor saxophonist Albert Ayler. </p> <p>Eventually Hunter settled in Stockholm, switched to organ, and set about accumulating the capital to buy a property. He was industrious, teaching at music school by day and doing clubwork by night while also responsible for opening and closing a terminus on the city's underground system. </p> <p>He was a generous man, of few words and modest manner, and his turn as recipient came after meeting Ziggy Marley. Grandson of Leroy Anderson, Ziggy enabled Hunter to return to Jamaica in the mid-1990s. There, in Port Antonio, he embraced Seventh Day Adventism and lived the quiet life. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Kenneth Benjamin Hunter, singer and instrumentalist, born May 4 1922; died September 20 2004</p>",
  "Six men - half the adult males of isolated Pitcairn island - were given sentences of up to six years in jail for rapes and sex attacks dating back 40 years, British authorities in New Zealand said yesterday. <p>Pitcairn's mayor, Steve Christian, a descendent of the Bounty mutiny leader, Fletcher Christian, was convicted of five rapes of young women and sentenced to three years in prison. His son, Randy, the chairman of an island committee, was sentenced to six years for four rapes and five indecent assaults.</p> <p>Len Brown, 78, was convicted of two rapes and sentenced to two years. His son, Dave, was convicted of nine indecent assaults and sentenced to community service. Dennis Christian, 49, the postmaster and another descendant of Fletcher Christian, was sentenced to community service for one indecent assault and two sexual assaults.</p> <p>Terry Young was convicted of one rape and six indecent assaults, and was jailed for five years. Jay Warren, the magistrate, was cleared of indecent assault.</p> <p>The sentences were suspended pending appeals by the defence against Britain's jurisdiction over the remote Pacific island, which became the refuge of men who mutinied aboard HMS Bounty in 1789. They later settled on Pitcairn with Tahitian brides.</p> <p>The trials, held under British law in a makeshift courtroom on the island, lifted the lid on decades of sex abuse of women and girls as young as five.</p> <p>Prosecutors said sex attacks had taken place all over the island, including in church. Victims testified they often did not report abuse because of the culture of silence.</p> <p>\"In setting the sentences, the court indicated that it has taken into account the unique nature of Pitcairn and factors such as its isolation and the small number of able-bodied people among the small population of 47,\" said a spokesman for the British High Commission in Wellington.</p>",
  "South Africa's most prolific mass murderer was released on parole yesterday after serving 12 years in jail for a shooting spree that made him an apartheid folk hero. <p>Louis van Schoor is believed to have shot 101 black people, killing 39 of them, including children, while working as a security guard in the port city of East London.</p> <p>Praised by warders as a model prisoner, Van Schoor walked free yesterday thanks to a sentence reduction for all convicts issued by Nelson Mandela when he was president.</p> <p>The 53-year-old - appearing relaxed and cheerful -spoke to reporters outside the prison gates. He said he would not return to the security business, but would take up farming and spend time with his fianc\u00e9e, Eunice Cornelius, a Cape Town lawyer.</p> <p>He declared himself \"happy that the time has come to join society again\", and said he hoped the public would forget his past and judge him on his future.</p> <p>He had found God in prison. When prompted, he expressed sorrow to the relatives of his victims. \"I apologise if any of my actions caused them hurt,\" he said.</p> <p>Van Schoor was convicted in 1992 of killing seven people and attempting to murder another two under the guise of protecting business premises from thieves.</p> <p>Survivors testified that he captured and killed burglars before calling the police. When there were no thieves, he would drag pedestrians from the street into the premises and shoot them.</p> <p>Under apartheid, Van Schoor was protected by police officers and magistrates who commended his efficiency and overlooked the fact that all his victims were black or coloured and that not one carried a gun.</p> <p>He was arrested when the white minority regime crumbled, but prosecutors were able to charge him with only a fraction of his crimes. Just after his final murder, and before he realised his impunity was over, the Afrikaner boasted to a journalist: \"Number 39, pal.\"</p> <p>During his trial, white residents drove around East London with \"I Love Louis\" stickers on their cars, decorated with three bullet holes through a heart. Black residents called him Jesus because of his flowing beard.</p> <p>Van Schoor's daughter, Sabrina, ended up in another section of his jail in 2002 for paying a black man to slit the throat of his former wife, Beverley, on the grounds that she was a racist who objected to Sabrina's liaisons with non-whites.</p> <p>Van Schoor said yesterday that he would miss his daughter now he was out, but promised to look after her own daughter, who is of mixed race. Embracing his fianc\u00e9e, who may become his fifth wife, he told the Daily Dispatch newspaper that he had studied agriculture and worked in the prison's vegetable patch. There was a muted response to his release, which was ignored by most of the South African media.</p> <p>Relatives of his victims, who were mostly poor and uneducated, made no protest, possibly because they were not aware of the news. Heidi Holland, a journalist writing a book about Sabrina van Schoor, said the port city's white residents still esteemed Louis van Schoor, adding: \"There is no way East London is doing any soul-searching today.\"</p>",
  "<p>He may not have a sports car and he doesn't order a martini, shaken or otherwise, but if they're looking to cast a new James Bond, Nick Cave should audition. Besuited and sitting in a Helsinki hotel, he gives off a certain secret-agent-on-holiday vibe. His quickness with an arched-eyebrowed quip, an old-fashioned courtesy and a certain familiarity with life's darker side make him a good fit. \"Well, I don't plan to do any more acting, unless it's a small part, but I often see pictures of myself and think, yeah, I look just like Pierce Brosnan,\" he says drily. </p> <p>He's here in Helsinki, a picture-book city known for its Baltic scenery and plentiful statues, on a small tour prior to his UK shows. Nick has plans for a statue of his own, to be erected in the town square of his home town of Warracknabeal, near Melbourne: a life-sized bronze featuring Nick sat atop a rearing horse. </p> <p>\"We found out it was going to cost an extraordinary amount of money so it was decided to make a film of the whole journey of this thing. We were going to make it in England, ship it to Australia, put it on the back of a truck, and dump it in my home town, which is an extremely small, ultra-conservative place. It's now been turned into a rehousing town for ex-cons who want to go straight, only nobody has gone straight, and it's turned into this strange lawless place,\" he explains, exhaling a lungful of smoke. \"If they don't accept it we were just going to drive it out to the desert and dump it somewhere, Planet Of The Apes style.\" </p> <p>Nick Cave, a source of civic pride? Is he serious? Apparently so, although his interviews often have a casual relationship with the truth. In the past he's told reporters that he was born with a tail, and now he's insisting that at sound-check they rocked. In a progressive way. \"It's one of my darkest secrets, that I do know a lot about prog rock. Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, Moody Blues, all that stuff. We do a mean version of Locomotive Breath.\" </p> <p>Since Nick's the one supplying the information, it's difficult to know when you're being led gently up the garden path. \"I'm Australian - even we don't know when we're joking and when we're not.\" Quizzed separately, the rest of the band back his spectacularly unlikely claim. </p> <p>The band are often portrayed as being in bad need of a good laugh, but despite an obdurate refusal to look on the bright side, as with Leonard Cohen's output, there's a streak of gallows humour running through Cave's work. Broadly speaking, he writes upbeat songs about death and miserable ones about love. Anyone who duets with Kylie and sings about caving her head in with a rock has an interesting funny bone. Then there's the comic-opera campness of the Murder Ballads album, with a death count of 37. It has to be said, if you find yourself in a Nick Cave video, wear shoes you can run in and get out while you have the chance: it's unlikely to end well for you. </p> <p>The new album, Abattoir Blues/ The Lyre Of Orpheus, features visions of hell, of course, but also love songs and pastoral imagery alongside black humour. A double album, it's the first without guitarist Blixa Bargeld, and is their fastest selling record to date. A \"micro-Seeds\" consisting of Jim Sclavunos, Martyn P Casey and Warren Ellis decamped to Paris to help with the writing. \"There were certain power-driven songs I wanted to do that I had in my head, but they needed other people to get them to work and, as it turned, out it was a fruitful thing to do.\" </p> <p>Cave has a slight punching-the-clock approach to interviews, totally at odds with his demeanour before and after. He is a musician who enjoys only the work, and not the self-promotion that comes with it. Armed with a roll-up, his words are chosen painstakingly, in a way that suggests they may have been misconstrued in the past. This reticence is matched by his profound distaste for the music industry's celebration of itself. </p> <p>When offered an MTV award, he was not so much uncomfortable as utterly demoralised, declining to \"harness my muse to this tumbrel, this bloody cart of severed heads and glittering prizes\". Adverts are unconscionable to him, a transgression he seems to regard as being on a par with putting cats in the microwave or murdering children. When Gap approached him, he responded with another letter: \"Dear Gap, I might put on a pair of your jeans if you were to pay me $1bn, but even then I would have serious reservations.\" </p> <p>His self-destructive past is well documented. In the late 1970s he was an art student playing in the celebrated but nihilistic band the Birthday Party, which he remembers as being \"in a total state of disgrace\". He became addicted to heroin and his habit continued throughout the 1980s and much of the 1990s when, in the early days especially, he often looked like something the Grim Reaper threw back. Having cleaned up when he met his wife, Vivienne Westwood model Susie Bick, with whom he has twins, he now leads an almost comically respectable family life, and is widely regarded as one of the finest literary songwriters around. \"I'm a non-story,\" he claims, slightly disingenuously. \"I'm happily married, with kids, I go to the office, and I work nine to five.\" </p> <p>Right now, Nick wants to go sightseeing. Folded into a car, he requests Finnish folk songs from the driver, threatening to sing some himself and chats about politics and films. Nick's image of a spectral figure detached from modern life is not entirely accurate; he has little time for the current music scene, and doesn't watch TV, but he reads a newspaper, and knows what's happening in the world. The residents of Porvoo, a low-rise hamlet of ancient wooden houses and antique shops, are not sure what to make of the rake-thin man with jet-black hair and piercing blue eyes striding around purposefully. A sleepy, faintly forlorn place, like an out-of-season theme park, its residents stare with who-let-him-out-of-the-house looks. Some children even salute. He seems perfectly at ease with its Scandinavian oddness, and heads off for lunch at a snail restaurant. </p> <p>The band love to eat. You name it, they've eaten it. Gathered round a dinner table after the show, they order their food carefully, trading appetisers and discussing local delicacies reindeer and bear along with kangaroo and snake. They quite literally love their grub. \"Have you ever eaten insects?\" Warren ups the ante. \"I've had witchetty grubs,\" Nick enthuses gamely. </p> <p>The \"micro-Seeds\" are a robustly congenial cabal, despite a reputation for tortured intensity. Dressed way past the nines in their trademark gangster-chic suits and colourful shirts, their snap-crackle dialogue gives them a certain Reservoir Dogs flavour - like the characters, you sense they'd all want to be Mr Black - and the results are very entertaining indeed. Topics covered include what to say to the Crown Prince and Princess of Norway, who came backstage after a recent show, acceptable stage garb for their upcoming tour (suits of course, but Nick wants sequins, no less) and merchandising (Nick proposes a Lyre Of Orpheus tea towel). </p> <p>This easy camaraderie goes some way towards explaining their longevity. It takes dedication to keep a band together for 20 years, nearly three times as long as the Beatles. Especially when you consider they all have their own separate musical projects, along with the sheer impracticality of being scattered across three continents. As Jim puts it, \"Fuck Benetton, we were global before it was fashionable.\" Nick thinks it's due to their work ethic: \"We are men, we wear suits and we go to work.\" </p> <p>In any case, it is the ace up the band's sleeve. As the audience shouts out requests during their live show the following day, it's obvious that, like Nick's heroes Elvis and Bob Dylan, they really do have lots and lots of songs. To have this kind of repertory you have to have been around a while. And they're not getting off the stage until they're good and ready. </p> <p>\"The fact that you're getting older is the interesting thing. Obviously, it involves a series of small humiliations as you go along. It's admirable if you can suffer that stuff and be dignified about it at the same time.\" This is easier said than done. Earlier, in a mesmerisingly awkward TV interview, Nick was presented with a pair of orange gumboots. \"The whole thing was to see my response to that. I later found out the theme of this show was sexuality, which I wasn't told, so I'm left sitting there with a pair of orange gumboots in my hand. This is a sort of metaphor for my position in rock music.\" He may belong outside of rock, of celebrity, but all things considered, it's not a bad gig being Nick Cave. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds' UK tour begins on Wednesday</p>",
  "<p>The Government's proposed gambling bill has been universally criticised. The unanimous verdict among media pundits is that it will create a nation full of feckless, debt-ridden males, squandering the family fortune at the local casino while their women and children exist on bean juice and snot. </p> <p>Whether justified or not, the furore ignores that the internet has made gambling more accessible than ever. If you possess a PC, a phone line and a credit card, you need never leave the house to waste your cash, which is why four million people regularly gamble online. </p> <p>And no one batted an eyelid when Sky introduced Sky Bet, a service that allows hapless couch potatoes to use their remote controls to bet on live sport. In the interests of our nation's morals, I plumped the pillows on my sofa, opened an account of \u00a350 - to which Sky Bet added a complimentary yet ethically dubious tenner - and started my descent into depravity. </p> <p><strong>Bowls</strong><br> </p> <p> My TV guide tells me that live bowls is on at 5pm. What better way to test Sky Bet's boast that \"it matters more when there's money on it\" than a game in which it is de rigueur to be over 75 and smoke a pipe? I log in, but then my wife returns home with my son. I feel squalid, as if I have been downloading hardcore porn. My son demands the Tweenies, his bean-juice-hating mother shamefully egging him on. They win: the bowls isn't live at all and therefore I can't bet on it. </p> <p><strong>Money made:</strong> Zero. </p> <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Gambling works best as a shameful secret. </p> <p><strong>Horse Racing</strong></p> <p>The next evening I scour the schedules. The only live sport is something called Virtual Racing. I press the button and get a list of races from a place called Fortune (geddit?) Meadows. I choose the 4.20 and am given a list of nags. Their names, such as Bag A Nag, evoke Alan Partridge's legendary visit to the races (Alf Ramsey's Porn Dungeon; Zeinab Badawi's Twenty Hotels.) I stick \u00a35 on Take La Plage. Nothing happens. Turns out the race isn't until at 4.20 the following day. </p> <p>Before going to bed, I see that Tim Henman is due to play in the quarter finals of the US Open. Timbo has battled bravely against injury to reach the last eight and the newspapers are starting to get excited, which means the time of his choking is nigh. I lay an unpatriotic fiver on some street-fighting Slovak, hewn by years of hardship, to kick his Home Counties, scone-loving arse in straight sets. The Tiger wins. Easily. </p> <p><strong>Money lost:</strong> \u00a310. </p> <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Rid self of all ridiculous notions of street-fighting Slovaks hewn by years of hardship, etc. </p> <p><strong>Football</strong></p> <p>This is more like it. England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are all in action in World Cup qualifiers. I have alcohol and male company, a combination that ensures I am about to blow shedloads of cash. This also gives me a chance to sample some \"in-play\" betting, one of the service's big selling points. So I don't have to watch Scotland, an experience more harrowing than travelling by coach, I put a fiver on them losing 2-1 to Slovenia. </p> <p>England are playing Poland. I want to bet on how many times Martin Tyler's co-commentator, Glen Hoddle, will misuse the word \"situation\". (He once memorably said an injured player needed to be tested in an \"11 versus 11 situation\".) But the punts are not so original: I can bet on who scores the first goal, half-time score, and the result. I stick a fiver on Frank Lampard to score the opening goal. </p> <p>I switch to Wales against Northern Ireland. Within 20 minutes three men have been sent off, one for making the international gesture for \"Stick it up your arse\" - slapping left hand on right bicep while emphatically raising right fist skywards - to the crowd. He later says he was acknowledging his family, which makes you wonder about what they do for entertainment at Christmas round his place. </p> <p>Anyway, time to bet in-play. The score is 2-1 to the Irish. I bet they will hang on to that lead. It takes ages to place. Months of my son sucking the remote have dulled its reactions: the Blue Nile have recorded albums in less time than it takes for me to press the button and it register on screen. My TV keeps informing me I need to be quicker. I eventually place the bet but Wales equalise late on, Defoe scores first for England and Scotland draw nil-nil. Arse. </p> <p><strong>Money lost:</strong> \u00a315. </p> <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Buy new remote. </p> <p><strong>Horse Racing (II)</strong><br> </p> <p> I return to Fortune Meadows. In essence Virtual Racing is a computer-generated version of the seaside arcade game in which you pick a horse, place your bet, the yellow one goes off really quickly before being passed by the red one. After the first race one of the two smirking buffoons that present it - for some reason one of them cannot stop rubbing his thighs - pretends to have a phone conversation with one of the virtual riders. This is desperate television. </p> <p>In the next I bet on GG Top, at 12-1. He gets an early lead, comes under pressure in the final straight but hangs on and I WIN! I am \u00a360 richer. From a computer game. Jordan pops up on screen to plug the programme, but she doesn't have to sell it to me. I have \u00a390 in my previously impoverished account and I am hooked. </p> <p><strong>Money made:</strong> \u00a365. </p> <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Virtual sport matters more when there's money on it. </p> <p><strong>American Football</strong><br> </p> <p>It is the first weekend of the NFL season. Like many of my generation, when it first appeared on Channel 4 in the mid-1980s I pretended to like it for about a year, which is about how long a match lasts. Anyone who has stayed up to watch a Super Bowl knows the almost cosmic tedium this game generates. At midnight you sit with a beer on your hand watching some shrieking harpie massacring the Star Spangled Banner: 10 minutes later you're asleep in your armchair, having lost consciousness as soon as the first ball is kicked. </p> <p>Among the TV panel is an American pundit called Cecil - pronounced Sea-sull - who tells us that Minnesota will do well this season. I stick \u00a35 on them to beat Dallas by 13-18 points. True to form I fall asleep and don't find out until the next morning that Minnesota won 35-17. I win. Again! My account is now looking very handsome: \u00a3117.50. My wife urges me to bank it, perhaps spend it on something for the flat. My gambling is not some sordid little secret now: it's a boast, a brag, a viable way of making cash. It is patently time to stop. </p> <p><strong>Money made:</strong> \u00a327.50. </p> <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Always trust a man with an absurd Christian name. </p> <p><strong>Speedway</strong><br> </p> <p>For those raised in the late 1970s and early 1980s, speedway meant one of two things: a dizzying fairground ride accompanied by bad heavy metal and violent stares from scores of truculent feasties; or a series of motorbike races from some godforsaken concrete bowl in Poland that filled time on World Of Sport before the football results came in. The latter is currently enjoying a renaissance on Sky. </p> <p>Coventry are racing Oxford. I bet a fiver on Coventry winning heat four by five points to one, which means their riders have to finish in the first two places. At the first corner one of the Coventry riders loses control, falls off and slams spectacularly into the hoardings. </p> <p>Undeterred, I bet on Oxford to win heat six 5-1; they win 4-2. Deterred, I receive a hot \"inside\" tip that Paul Jewell is about to be unveiled as the new Blackburn Rovers manager. I stick down a fiver at 20-1 and pride myself on possessing such excellent contacts. Next morning Mark Hughes accepts the job. I curse myself for having such useless contacts, bank my winnings and promise the wife a slap-up dinner at the restaurant of her choice as long as it's cheap. </p> <p><strong>Overall money made:</strong> \u00a342.50. </p> <p><strong>Overall lessons learned: </strong> Bad sports remain bad sports whether you have money riding on them or not; remote controls are useless utensils for laying bets; and women are fickle.</p>",

  "The sum required by Gordon Brown to balance the books (Economists warn of big tax rise, October 29) could also be found by a 50% tax rate on earnings over \u00a3100,000 and then applying national insurance to all earnings above the current limit.

  "From small beginnings as a West Country carpet salesman, Timothy Robinson rose to prominence as one of Britain's most successful and flamboyant lawyers. <p>But yesterday, with the conclusion of a 10-year investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and three police forces, he was thrust into a new spotlight as the mastermind of the biggest legal aid fraud in British judicial history. </p> <p>After a series of trials that can only now be made public, details have emerged of how Robinson financed his defence practice and an unashamedly lavish lifestyle with bogus legal aid claims that may have earned him \u00a33m and his firm \u00a38.5m. </p> <p>He was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted at Bristol crown court in 2001 for conspiring to systematically defraud the legal aid system over a period of almost six years. </p> <p>He was also ordered to pay more than \u00a31m in compensation and costs. </p> <p>Having served half of his sentence, Robinson, 60, of Badgeworth, near Cheltenham, was released on parole in July. </p> <p>The solicitor sprang to national attention in 1996, when he represented Tracie Andrews, who killed her boyfriend and claimed he had been the victim of a road-rage attack. </p> <p>Details of Robinson's conviction and the racket that enabled him to amass such wealth were released yesterday at the end of legal proceedings involving a former employee. Press reporting was previously banned by Judge David Smith to avoid the risk of one trial prejudicing the outcome of the next. </p> <p>Since Robinson's conviction, there have been five trials and a further 21 of his former employees have pleaded guilty or have been found guilty of involvement in the conspiracy. Some have received prison sentences of between nine months and four years. </p> <p>Only five employees were acquitted, and charges against two have been allowed to lie on the file. The investigation and trials are themselves thought to have cost around \u00a33m. </p> <p>Detective Inspector Paul Yateman, senior investigating officer, said the investigation had exposed \"a den of corruption.\" </p> <p>Robinson was always a brash operator with an eye for making money. As a young man launching his carpet shop in Cheltenham, he \"declared war\" on the competition by hiring a tank and driving it around the town. </p> <p>His approach to the law was no less direct. The scam centred on so-called green forms, the documents used by solicitors to claim reimbursement from the Legal Aid Board. </p> <p>The court heard that up to 90% of the green forms submitted by his office in Cheltenham were fraudulent. </p> <p>Time spent with clients was exaggerated, prison visits were claimed for twice and clerks billed for cases that never existed. Crimes that clients mentioned informally were used as the basis for further claims. </p> <p>A police search unearthed 197 forms that were signed by clients but were not filled in and were therefore as valuable as blank cheques. Clients who cooperated were rewarded with cigarettes. </p> <p>Clerks hired on salaries of \u00a310,000 a year earned \u00a34,500 a month in overtime by making green form claims. </p> <p>They drove Mercedes cars with personalised number plates such as 4LAW and 7LAW, and Robinson sent them to find work in poorer areas with the cry, \"Where there's muck there's brass\". </p> <p>They received ties depicting the scales of justice, the serial number of the forms they exploited and the letters GEAF and KEH, which reminded them of Robinson's approach to clients: \"Give 'em a fag\" and \"Keep 'em happy\". </p> <p>But according to Margaret Leith, a clerk who received a suspended prison sentence after admitting her part in the conspiracy, the inflated salaries came at a price. </p> <p>\"It was a miserable existence,\" she said. \"You worked long hours and, on top of the anxiety that you might get caught, the pressure got more and more.\" </p> <p>When another employee, Richard Hill, began forging clients' signatures, the Law Society became suspicious and an inquiry was launched in 1993. Investigators took more than 3,000 witness statements and seized 21 tonnes of documents. </p> <p>Ian Glen QC, prosecuting, described Robinson as \"a mini-Maxwell, obsessed with power and money\". </p> <p>He said: \"I have no doubt he was charming in his style, someone who pleased his clients. But inside Mr Robinson was a business tycoon. The businessman got the better of the professional.\" </p> <p>Robinson's QC, David Etherington, said his client was a broken man. \"His reputation is utterly, completely ruined.\" </p> <p>Before the Legal Services Commission (LSC) was created in April 2000 to tighten up control of legal aid, any law firm could do legal-aid work. </p> <p>Provided a client passed the means test - administered by the solicitor - the green-form scheme could be used to provide advice, help or assistance on almost any legal problem, short of going to court. Now only firms with contracts with the LSC can do legal-aid work, under tight controls and audits. </p> <p>Robinson succumbed, but he was not alone. In 1997 a Worcester solicitor, James O'Malley, and his business associate, Michael Pattrick, were jailed for three-and-a-half years and five years respectively for fraud after obtaining more than \u00a3330,000 in less than six months by sending canvassers to ask tenants in rundown areas to sign blank forms. </p> <p>In 2000, Alan Pritchard, from Worcestershire, whose firm fraudulently claimed \u00a32.25m in one year, was jailed for five years. He was said to have used legal aid as a \"licence to print money\".</p>",
  "<p>Payment is to capitalism what sex is to evolution: they're both the vital moments of exchange and, interestingly, moments of extreme pleasure. With sex, there is the moment of orgasm; with payment, there is the moment you get your carrier bag. </p> <p>When paying, you can give the exact money or a big note. Fiddling around with change implies that you've scrimped and saved for your newspaper; giving a big note implies that you've just been paid. Some people insist on giving a big note together with some change, so the shopkeeper will give them \u00a31 coins back. Newsagents hate people like this, and often remove the magazine from the paper to stop them being so smug. </p> <p>Shopkeepers hate change. It's heavy, dirty, and an average newsagent lifts a total of three tonnes of it every day. That's why they don't like getting your change and they don't like giving their change. The only thing they like is tuppences, because they never bother getting these from the bank. </p> <p>Lots of prices end in 99p, but buy two of these items and they're stuffed. Always check your change while your hand's still out: 99 times out of 100, you'll get the right change, but it's worth spending a few minutes checking for 20p pieces from Guernsey, which are that island's largest export. </p> <p>The difference between a debit and a credit card is that a debit card spends money you haven't got now and a credit card spends money you haven't got later. The good thing about paying by card is that you pay to the exact penny and don't need to carry a pocketful of change. The bad news is that you'll never be able to park again. </p> <p>The lighter money is, the more likely you are to spend it. In the old days, a penny was the size of a baby's head and weighed as much as a small piano. It was not, therefore, something you frittered away on sweets. A credit card weighs less than an ice cream wafer, and is correspondingly easy to waft about. </p> <p>Barcodes are the DNA of non-living things. Instead of you and the shopkeeper happily reading the price together, your item is snatched from you and scanned. Then you both look at the little read-out on the till that says, \"Water, \u00a31.80.\" If these displays were linked to the Highways Agency, they would read Tiredness Can Kill, Take A Break. You could then go to a coffee shop and have your muffin scanned.</p>",
  "I have a nagging fear that one day I'll be telling some young whipper-snapper that in the early years of the century you could fly across Europe for a fiver. <p>They'll give me that look of indulgent disbelief reserved for delusional relatives in sheltered accommodation. </p> <p>I'll insist that it was true. Back in 2004, for only a few quid, ChavAir would take you across the continent, sometimes to airfields that were within a day's drive of an interesting city. </p> <p>And they'll ask me: \"Why didn't you go every weekend then?\" </p> <p>That prospect of lost opportunities haunts me every time I get an e-mail from a no-frills airlines advertising flights to Haugesund, Tampere or Klagenfurt. </p> <p>They might sound remote and obscure, like the names on old wireless sets. But they are only \u00a35 away. And one day this cheap flight bubble is going to burst. </p> <p>Except it's more complicated than that. Cheap flights have become a cat and mouse game, where the price of the bargain can take off quicker than the plane. </p> <p>Passengers want to travel for more or less nothing. But the airlines are planning the Red Riding Hood treatment - lure you into grandma's cottage and then have you for breakfast. It starts off with the inexplicable booking fees - breathing charges, shoe tax, hangover levy and so on. </p> <p>And then when you arrive at the airport it's like arriving at the bazaar, overflowing with pedlars selling trinkets, clothes, booze and insurance. </p> <p>It's called an \"airport terminal\", but we should face facts and say it's an off-motorway shopping centre, with a travel facility attached. </p> <p>Even the check-in queue is patrolled by someone trying to flog you a credit card. And it doesn't stop when you're on the plane. </p> <p>It's only a matter of time before we're haggling with the air crew over carpets. \"You drink tea with us. Then I give you good price.\" </p> <p>And the airlines want to get a slice of the action, so they're developing new wheezes to turn your fiver into much more. </p> <p>Anyone travelling this half-term might have seen a bust-up over baggage allowances. </p> <p>If you try to bring anything heavier than a handkerchief, you can get hit by an excess luggage charge that costs more than the flight. </p> <p>It's probably only fair because the suitcase will get more leg room and better treatment. </p> <p>If you get past the weigh-in unscathed, you might plan to save money by buying a drink before boarding. </p> <p>I made this mistake a few weeks ago.

  "<b> Who dares refuse to pay?</b> <br> Richard Colbey's article last week arguing that bank penalty charges are unenforcable was very interesting, but left one nagging question: How do you refuse to pay a charge, when the bank holds your money and can make deductions at will? <p>Do you just ring them up and say: \"I refuse to pay\"? </p> <p>I can't imagine that you can say to the bank: \"Instead of taking the charges out of my account, please invoice me. Then I can refuse to pay, and then you can take me to court for non-payment.\" </p> <p>Given that \u00a33bn is raised in charges, one would have thought that had the levies been illegal, the OFT would have acted on behalf of consumers. Perhaps I'm too optimistic that the OFT would actually act in this way. <br><b>Andrew Hana</b>, via email</p> <p> Note from editor: The OFT said this week it is investigating the \"questionable validity\" of late penalty charges and if they are in breach of consumer contract law. </p> <p><b> This really is the limit</b><br> Last week's J&amp;M complained about increasing bank charges, including those for unauthorised overdrafts. </p> <p>I have to say I have no sympathy with people who run up unauthorised overdrafts and am quite happy to see the banks not merely covering their costs, but making a profit in these situations. </p> <p>I see no reason why the many of us who keep our accounts in good order should be expected to subsidise those who don't. <br><b>Martin Staniforth</b>, Hastings </p> <p> A person exceeding their overdraft limit will have carried on spending money after having spent \u00a3500 that isn't their own. </p> <p>The risk of lending to this person hasn't changed but their inability to curb their spending tends to indicate they were at higher risk of defaulting in the first place. </p> <p>Mr Colbey states that those \"who are not completely in control financially\" have to resort to unauthorised overdrafts. When my finances were tight I adopted a simple system. I made sure all my vital expenditure (rent, electricity, etc) left my account right after my salary went in. I'd then always check my balance before taking money out for day-to-day expenses. </p> <p>This is hardly \"completely in control financially\" (I'd rarely, if ever, keep track of cash payments) but it's kept me from exceeding my limit. </p> <p>At a time of ever rising consumer debt, it seems irresponsible to imply, as Mr Colbey appears to be doing, that unauthorised overdrafts are the norm and nothing to be concerned about. <br><b>Stephen Brown</b>, Hastings </p> <p><b> Give credit to Ikea staff</b><br> I was astounded by the rant last week by a reader regarding Ikea's 70p charge for credit card use. </p> <p>As a cash purchaser I have always resented the fact that I am effectively subsidising credit card users whose transactions cost retailers a percentage of the bill. </p> <p>I always feel sympathy for the checkout staff at places like Ikea; please don't encourage your readers to make their lives more difficult by engaging in trolley rage. </p> <p>If you have a problem, contact senior management. <br><b>MJ Kennedy</b>, London E17 </p> <p> <b> Why I binned these letters</b><br> Yesterday I received a letter from Standard Life pointing out the future costs of putting my children through university and offering me a savings package to make provision for them easier. </p> <p>Today I received the letter, as forecast recently in J&amp;M, telling me that Standard Life had withdrawn its endowment promise. </p> <p>I'm amazed that the company refuses to face up to the fact that their failure to deliver on their endowment policies has seriously affected people's ability to put extra money aside for things such as children's university education. I threw both letters in the bin. <br><b>J Davies</b>, Market Harborough </p> <p><b> Renewable savings...</b><br> In your issue of October 16 you discussed utility prices with savings of up to \u00a3150 a year. But please, is this The Guardian or some other unenlightened daily? Why no mention at all of renewables, and why not include comparisons of companies like Good Energy and Ecotricity? Maybe you can't save \u00a3150, but you might save a helluva lot more in the long run. Please live up to what your readers expect of you.  <b>Helen Higgs</b>, Cambridge</p> <p><b> Solicitors left out of the will</b><br> You report that under the Will Aid scheme, participating solicitors will waive normal charges for drawing up a will. Excellent. But, as ever, remember never to allow a solicitor to name himself, or a crony, as executor and trustee. If the executor is a solicitor, he can employ himself as \"solicitor for the estate\", pay himself whatever he thinks he can get away with, work at whatever pace, and to whatever standard, and is not subject to normal client supervision. </p> <p>It is better to ask any other reliable person of average ability to be an executor. This person, who can be a beneficiary, can then shop around and employ a solicitor of their choosing to do the actual work. </p> <p>Having agreed a basis for charging, the executor can then monitor the solicitor's work in the usual way. <br><b>Gwyn Jones, Cheshire</b></p>",
  "Al-Jazeera tonight aired a video of Osama bin Laden directly admitting for the first time that he carried out the September 11 attacks and criticising George Bush. <p>It was the first footage of the al-Qaida leader to surface in more than a year. </p> <p>The video, in which Bin Laden referred to next week's US presidential election, showed Bin Laden in traditional white robes, a turban and a cloak reading from papers and standing in front of a plain, brown cloth background.</p> <p>Bin Laden said: \"We decided to destroy towers in America\" out of frustration over what many Arabs see as America's pro-Israeli Middle East policies.</p> <p>He said the attack was carried out because \"we are a free people ... and we want to regain the freedom of our nation.\"</p> <p>He accused Mr Bush of \"misleading\" the American people in the years since the 2001 suicide airline hijackings that hit New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</p> <p>Addressing the American people, he said: \"Your security is not in the hands of (Democratic candidate John) Kerry or (President George ) Bush or al-Qaida.

  "<p>A life-size nude by Lucian Freud of one of the world's most admired and photographed women will go on sale next year. </p> <p>Lucian Freud's Naked Portrait 2002 shows a pregnant Kate Moss draped over a bed, her head resting lightly on her left arm. With rounded belly and a discreet little fold of skin beneath her right breast, this is a magnificent, voluptuous, flesh-and-blood Moss, hardly the wispy, ethereal creature she often appears in photographs. Her face recedes into the background and her calves are prominently displayed; this is Moss as few have ever seen her. </p> <p>The painting will form one of the highlights of the Postwar and Contemporary Art sale at Christie's in London next February, where it is expected to fetch \u00a32.5 to \u00a33.5m. The most paid for a Freud was $5.8m (\u00a33.2m) in New York in 1998 for Large Interior W11. </p> <p>Pilar Ordovas, an associate director of Christie's, said that the fame of the sitter affected the estimate only \"up to a point\". </p> <p>\"The most important thing is how strong the painting is,\" she said. </p> <p>Moss is, with the exception of the Queen, the best-known person Freud has ever painted. He tends to steer clear of depicting those who model for a living. He once said, \"They've grown another skin because they've been looked at so much.\" </p> <p>Ms Ordovas said: \"This is an important recent work by the artist, and it's very interesting also for who the sitter is - Freud hardly ever paints professional models; the only other exception is Jerry Hall. In the end, though, it's a wonderful painted portrait of a nude pregnant woman who happens to be Kate Moss.\" </p> <p>Freud did not finish the painting in time for his huge Tate retrospective in 2002, so the work has barely been seen before. After completion, it was sold to a private collector by the artist's New York dealer. The British public will have a chance to see it for the first time at Christie's in London from February 1. </p> <p>The work was created in 2001-2 at Freud's Holland Park studio in west London. The artist had read an interview with Moss in Dazed &amp; Confused magazine in which she revealed that she longed to be painted by him. </p> <p>Freud contacted Moss, and a series of nocturnal sittings started, often preceded by dinner at a local restaurant and continuing until the small hours. By Freud's standards, the painting was done quite quickly, since Moss's pregnancy provided a natural deadline. </p> <p>When his Tate Britain exhibition opened in 2002, Freud failed to attend the opening. The speculation at the time was that he was busy completing the portrait. </p> <p>Back in 2002, Moss hinted that she wanted to buy the picture herself. She missed her chance then, but in February could have a second bite - if she can part with all that cash, of course.</p>",
  "A man who was shot by police while carrying a table leg which was mistaken for a gun, was unlawfully killed, an inquest jury ruled today. <p>Harry Stanley, 46, a painter and decorator of Hackney, east London, was shot in the head and hand by police marksmen on September 22 1999. Two Metropolitan police officers fired the shots after mistakenly being informed that Mr Stanley had a sawn-off shotgun. </p> <p>The father-of-three, who was originally from Lanarkshire, Scotland, was carrying a blue plastic bag with a coffee table leg inside, which had just been repaired by his brother Peter. He was shot as he walked home from the Alexandra Pub in Hackney. </p> <p>Today a jury of six women and four men at St Pancras coroner's court took around seven hours to reach their majority verdict at the end of a two week inquest.</p> <p>The inquest was the second to take place into Mr Stanley's death. The open verdict recorded at the end of the original inquest was later quashed by the high court. </p> <p>The dead man's family and friends have campaigned for a new inquest and today there were shouts of \"yes\" from the public gallery as the verdict was read out. </p> <p>The officers who shot Mr Stanley told the inquest earlier that they thought he was raising a gun and was about to shoot when they confronted him. One, PC Kevin Fagan, described how he saw Mr Stanley walking with a cylindrical object in his hand. He said: \"It was tightly wrapped in a bag, about 18in long and the majority of it was pointing downwards ... the realisation struck me that I was about to be shot at 15ft with a sawn-off shotgun.\"</p> <p>The officer said he shouted for the man to \"drop it\" by which time he was looking straight at the officer in a \"boxer's stance\". PC Fagan said Mr Stanley then moved his left hand to grip the object so he carried it with both hands. The officer said he fired just before his colleague Inspector Neil Sharman, hitting him in the hand. </p> <p>Mr Sharman told the inquest he fired one round when he thought PC Fagan was about to be shot. \"Fearing for Kevin Fagan's life, and believing that the contents of that bag was a sawn-off shotgun, and with the actions of the person holding it, I felt he was about to be shot. In response I fired one round,\" Mr Sharman said. </p> <p>He told the court he aimed at Mr Stanley's \"central body mass\" but missed and shot him in the head. The Stanley family's barrister described Mr Sharman's version of events as \"concocted\". </p> <p>After the verdict was delivered, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it had recommended that the coroner invite the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers to commission research in order to try to prevent similar deaths. Coroner Dr Andrew Reid backed the recommendation.</p> <p>The IPCC commissioner, Deborah Glass, said: \"There is a need for further research into whether there are more effective methods for firearms officers in dealing with vulnerable people, such as those impaired by alcohol, as Mr Stanley was. </p> <p>\"Such people are often less likely to react rationally and more likely to react negatively to certain sorts of approaches and challenges.\" The inquest heard evidence that since Mr Stanley's death, the Met had substantially improved training for control room staff, as well as for firearms officers and tactical advisors. The inquest also heard that \"less lethal\" options such as tasers, or electrified darts, were now more readily available to Met officers. </p> <p>Deborah Coles, co-director of deaths in custody campaign group Inquest, which has been working with the Stanley family, said: \"This inquest is a vindication of the family's fight for the truth and the only just outcome of this shocking case ... We now expect them to be prosecuted for manslaughter. We have always believed that these officers should face criminal charges.\" </p> <p>Mr Stanley's widow Irene, 51, said outside the court that she was pleased with the verdict but now she thought that the officers should be suspended. </p> <p>She said: \"Harry was an unarmed man. It is bad enough the family was devastated when Harry died. We should not have to fight for justice. My grieving has been fighting for justice. I have not had time to grieve.\" </p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service looked at the case in 2001 and concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the police officers involved in the death. However a CPS spokeswoman confirmed today that it would review the case. </p> <p>The Metropolitan police said it was \"re-considering\" suspending the two officers until the outcome of a review by the IPCC. </p> <p>A force spokesman said: \"The Met wishes to again offer its sympathy to the family of Mr Stanley and express our regret for his death ... the death resulted from the most tragic set of circumstances ... it must be remembered that the officers were called upon to make a split-second decision while confronting what they believed to be an imminent threat to their lives. They did not have the benefit of hindsight. </p> <p>\"Along with their colleagues working in police armed response units, they are required to regularly face the most challenging of policing situations in order to make the streets of London safer for us all.\"</p>",
  "Peter Marx, one of the leaders of the National Democratic party of Germany (NPD), makes no bones about it: his neo-Nazi party's surprise success in the September 19 regional elections in Saxony was no mere fluke. It was planned like a military operation: the party defined its goals, studied the terrain, drew up a plan of action and drummed up the resources. <p>As a result, for the first time in its history, 12 NPD candidates were elected to the Landtag (state parliament) of Saxony in Dresden. They obtained 191,087 votes, or 9.2% of the poll. The NPD had only once done as well as that, in Baden-W\u00bfrttemberg in 1969. After that, it virtually disappeared from the official scene.</p> <p>Convinced as they are that Germany is now in a virtually pre-revolutionary situation, NPD leaders have the wind in their sails. Their party's headquarters are in the offices of its monthly, Deutsche Stimmung (German Opinion), in the town of Riesa, not far from Dresden. On the first floor, an editorial staff of 10 produces a paper that has a circulation of about 10,000, mostly by subscription. On sale on the ground floor are T-shirts with edifying logos, \"history\" books praising units of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS in the second world war, insignia and CDs.</p> <p>All propaganda in favour of the Nazi regime is forbidden in Germany. The NPD is a past master at apparently sticking to the letter of the law while subverting it.</p> <p>J\u00bfrgen G\u00bfnsel, who wears heavy laced boots, a black T-shirt and black jeans, sits on the NPD's national executive and is now a member of Saxony's Landtag. Still only 30, he has had a long career as a far-right activist. It began when he was at high school in Hesse and continued when he repeatedly got into trouble with the law after raising his arm and shouting \"Heil Hitler!\" in public.</p> <p>Peter Marx, 38, a former head of the NPD in the western state of Saarland, is a more discreet man than G\u00bfnsel, preferring to wear a suit and tie. He has just been voted secretary general of the NPD's parliamentary group in Saxony's Landtag, a key post that rewards his talent as an organiser. He joined the NPD in Saarland at the age of 16. A jurist and marketing consultant, he is a man of ideas.</p> <p>His supporters marched at the \"Monday demonstrations\" organised against the Gerhard Schr\u00bfder government's unpopular measures, dubbed the \"Hartz IV reforms\" after their instigator. Their banner bore the slogan \"Marx rather than Hartz\". This was a nod in the direction of communist voters present at the same demonstration, from whom the NPD has borrowed many of its anticapitalist slogans.</p> <p>In Saxony the NPD chose another communist-inspired symbol for its election stickers ? a clenched fist brandished not against fascism but against Schr\u00bfder's reforms. Several days after the election, thousands of stickers were still visible in Saxony. No one had scribbled on them or slashed them ? something that would be unthinkable in the west of the country. \"That's the way it is in our region,\" says Wolkmar W\u00bflke, an activist in the neocommunist PDS who keeps a close eye on the NPD. \"As the NPD hasn't been banned, it's legal, and as it's legal it has the right to express itself. Some of our members even go along with that. It's a hangover from the time of the German Democratic Republic, when all parties except one were banned.\"</p> <p>Four years ago a team of NPD activists from western Germany turned up in Riesa. \"We'd learned a lot from the French National Front, whose activists had helped us out in Saarland more than once,\" Marx says proudly. \"We realised we needed to personalise the debate and put forward capable people with some social standing, candidates who could put together arguments about social justice. We also adopted a number of ideas aired by Oskar Lafontaine [a former president of the Social Democrats now in bad odour with the party], such as his claim that Germany is rudderless, and that Schr\u00bfder is a liar who makes promises he doesn't keep.\"</p> <p>The NPD abandoned its loutish, aggressive style and patiently established itself in small towns and villages. It found new activists in them and, better, won over worthies disillusioned with the mainstream parties. The NPD's first elected candidates soon found their way on to local councils, thus helping to make the party respectable.</p> <p>The NPD had a two-pronged strategy aimed both at a traditional conservative electorate and at young people with no prospects at a local level. Seasoned activists started canvassing outside colleges and got involved in management of the few youth centres that had survived the break-up of the former GDR. In areas where such centres no longer existed, the activists went out to meet young people who spent their weekends drinking beer in filling-station car parks to the sound of hard rock.</p> <p>The NPD decided to turn its back on confrontation and parades of unsavoury-looking bully-boys. It resorted to a new technique: it got activists to exploit the worries of youngsters who had no choice but to seek work in western Germany. The most go-getting of them had already done so. Many of those who stayed behind were ensnared by the NPD, which exploited their resentment by pointing a finger at immigrants.</p> <p>The fact that immigration is lower in Saxony than in western Germany, and that, in a region where jobs are hard to come by immigrant labour can hardly be made out as a threat, did not worry the party strategists.</p> <p>NPD ideologues are skilled at moving the goalposts. They are prepared to use any argument. They put themselves across as critics of globalisation, enemies of the US and Israel, and strong believers in a Europe where an authoritarian Russia, the last bulwark against the Asian hordes, would be allotted its proper place.</p> <p>During the election campaign, NPD activists gave high-school students free copies of a CD on which the far right's \"bard\", Frank Rennicke, sings \"The Country of Our Fathers\", a group called Abattoir celebrates \"the hour of the patriots\" and the less distinguished singers of Noie Werte scream \"Fuck the USA!\"</p> <p>The NPD's virulent form of anti-Americanism, which condemns the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, enables it to draw a parallel with the bombings of Hamburg and Berlin in 1943 and 1945, commemorate the martyrdom of the German people, and connect Germany's present travails with the tragic past. It is a novel approach, but one that pays off: last August no fewer than 7,000 people gathered at the NPD's summer festival at M\u00bfcka, near the Polish border.</p> <p>Most of the people who voted for the NPD in Saxony were jobless and under 30. In many cases they were first-time voters and driven by frustration: according to a recent survey, 54% of NPD supporters feel they own less than they deserve. The figure for Germany as a whole is 37%.</p> <p>\"Political power can be defined by its degree of effectiveness and the legitimacy it gets from an election,\" says Klaus-Peter Sick, a historian at the Marc Bloch Centre in Berlin. \"From 1933 to 1990, the east of the country was deprived of democratic elections. Parliamentary liberal democracy does not have deep roots here. What matters more than in the rest of Germany is the cohesion of the community and what is redistributed by the regime. The preservation of democracy comes after that.</p> <p>\"The botched reunification of Germany prompted thousands of youngsters to leave their region in search of jobs. Those who stayed behind have been left by the wayside. They are embittered and prepared to throw themselves into the arms of the NPD, partly because their rebellion contradicts the knee-jerk antifascism of their parents in the GDR.\"</p> <p>With its take on a wide range of issues that feed the fears and fantasies of its constituency ? America, migratory flows, the erosion of values and of authority, unemployment ? the NPD seems to have found a way to transform the east's problems into electoral gains.</p> <p>It is hard to say whether Saxony's disorientated NPD voters were aware of the subtext involved in their choice ? the design and black-white-and-red colours of NPD posters that inevitably call to mind the Nazi flag with its swastika, the activists' marches redolent of earlier parades, and some unusually striking words buried in the middle of a speech that would not have seemed out of place in the mouth of Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels.</p> <p>In an opinion poll just after the September election, a majority of NPD voters said they chose the party purely to express their disgruntlement. The fact remains that the NPD seizes every opportunity of exploiting the subliminal effect of such parallels. Bottles thrown into the sea do occasionally reach their destination.</p>",
  "In July 2003, when travel around Iraq didn't require armoured cars and armed guards, my translator and I took a day trip to Falluja. Unrest was on the rise there and we were curious about who was behind the violence.Was it indeed former members of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party? We wanted to get some truth on the ground. Even if the reporting foray was a failure, we planned to stuff ourselves at Haji Hussein, our favourite kebab restaurant. <p>At the mayor's office and the police station, my translator, Naseer, tried to find someone who would speak with candour. \"They're all liars,\" he declared after a few interviews. Then, as we were about to give up, a mayoral aide told us to look up the city's senior tribal chief, Sheikh Khamis Hassnawi. \"He'll tell you what's really happening,\" the aide whispered.</p> <p>In a city where residents often began conversations with diatribes against the presence of American troops in Iraq, Hassnawi was a refreshing exception. Over Dunhill cigarettes and takeaway from Haji Hussein, he talked about how Falluja could be saved with the help of the US military. The Americans, he said, needed to find a way to employ the legions of former soldiers and other disaffected young\u00camen milling about the city. Unlike Shias in the south, who had grown accustomed to unemployment and poverty, Sunnis in Falluja had thrived on government contracts, smuggling and graft. Postwar joblessness was a new, embarrassing and dangerous phenomenon. \"Either you put them to work,\" he said, \"or they will turn to the resistance.\"</p> <p>Late last month, as I was packing my possessions and preparing to return to the US after 18\u00camonths as the Washington Post's bureau chief in Baghdad, Naseer came to my hotel room and tried to contact Hassnawi on the phone so that I could say goodbye. As he kept redialling, it became clear how much things in Iraq had changed over those months. The telephone had become the only way for me to contact Hassnawi, who was holed up at home, too afraid to venture out. I too had become a prisoner in my hotel, unable to roam a country I had grown to love, forced to phone people I once used to visit.</p> <p>My folding roadmap, dog-eared from repeated excursions last year, had grown dusty on my bookshelf. By last summer every road leading out of Baghdad had become too dangerous to travel. The capital was a patchwork of red (no-go) and yellow (proceed with extreme caution) zones, surrounding the American-controlled Green Zone. Neighbourhoods where I had visited Iraqi friends for lunch were now too insecure to enter. And even if I was willing to chance it, my friends didn't want to risk being seen allowing a foreigner into their house.</p> <p>It had not started out this way, and perhaps it did not need to have turned out this way. </p> <p>Lured by Hassnawi's willingness to speak freely, I periodically dropped in on him after our first meeting, to get his take on the deteriorating security situation in Falluja. He knew the ringleaders and their lieutenants. He was among the first to warn of the arrival of foreign fighters. He represented the city council in early talks with the US military. But in our discussions, he always returned to the same point: start reconstruction projects and create jobs. To his dismay, many of his unemployed tribesmen were joining the insurgency, lured by $500 paymentsto take part in attacks.</p> <p>It became increasingly dangerous to meet Hassnawi. Early this year insurgents and their sympathisers began threatening reporters and chasing them out of town. When Naseer and I went to see the sheikh in March at his farmhouse south of the city, a second vehicle accompanying us served as a scout, ready to alert us with a walkie-talkie of any problems ahead. Two weeks later, four American security contractors were murdered and mutilated in front of Haji Hussein. Falluja became a no-go area for us, the first in what has turned into a lengthy list of places in Iraq where it is too dangerous to operate as a foreign journalist. A few days after the murders, US Marines laid siege to Falluja. The simmering guerrilla war erupted into an all-out conflict, with most young men fighting along with the hard-core insurgents to defend their city. Hassnawi and others who had advocated engagement with the Americans either fled or hid in their homes.</p> <p>The Marines eventually pulled out and handed over security responsibilities to a group of former Iraqi soldiers who were cowed and co-opted by resistance leaders. With the city still in the hands of insurgents, Hassnawi has received death threats, some delivered by his own tribesmen. Although he would like to meet Marine commanders, and they want to see him, it has been impossible to arrange. </p> <p>As a Sunni Muslim, Hassnawi had every reason to oppose the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated government. He had never been tortured. None of his relatives wound up in mass graves. He had received regular payouts from Saddam's government, enough to buy a shiny new Mercedes.</p> <p>But Hassnawi insisted that democracy was in the best interests of his country, even if it meant that Sunnis would have to cede control to the Shia majority. He reasoned that a new government, with the help of the US, could restore the prosperity that Iraq had enjoyed decades ago. Of course, he wanted a share of that wealth, of the reconstruction contracts and trade deals that he hoped would materialise.</p> <p>He maintained that much of the unrest in the city could have been prevented had the US military and the occupation authority devoted more attention and resources to Falluja last year. For months the city was an afterthought. There was no full-time presence of US troops until nearly three weeks after Saddam had been toppled. By the time commanders in Baghdad realised that they needed to send more units there, Ba'athist leaders had begun organising themselves into insurgent cells that would later be aided by extremist clerics and fighters from outside Iraq.</p> <p>If the US occupation authority, the vast bureaucracy that was supposed to administer postwar Iraq, had heeded Hassnawi's advice ? had there been an infusion of reconstruction funds in those early days, creating jobs and giving people hope in the future ? I suspect that many young men would have opted not to side with the insurgents. But no such funds existed. Military commanders had only a modest budget to pay for small public works projects. It was not until last spring that the occupation authority began doling out large contracts. By then, however, Falluja was deemed too volatile for reconstruction work.</p> <p>It was one of many opportunities the US has missed during its occupation of Iraq.</p> <p>The mis-steps began with US forces doing little to stop the looting of government buildings and, more importantly, of vast ammunition depots. It was clear that the military was thoroughly unprepared for the chaos and instability that had been unleashed.</p> <p>The US administrator, Paul Bremer, disbanded the Iraqi army and barred many members of Saddam's Ba'ath Party from government jobs, putting more than 300,000 people out of work. Many of them later joined the resistance. Then there was Bremer's initial refusal to allow the formation of an interim government, instead antagonising the most pro-American Iraqi leaders by relegating them to an advisory council. He failed to reach out quickly to the country's most influential Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. He hired staffers based on Republican party connections rather than development experience, hindering the occupation authority's ability to fulfil its mission. Meanwhile the Bush administration waited for months to ask Congress for the necessary billions for reconstruction and several more months to issue the first contracts.</p> <p>Hassnawi still sees signs of hope. Falluja residents have grown weary of the presence of foreign fighters, particularly followers of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian-born militant who is regarded by the US as the pre-eminent terrorist ringleader in Iraq. Although the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, has threatened military action against Falluja unless it hands over Zarqawi and his group, Hassnawi believes residents cannot do it alone. US warplanes have pounded Falluja for weeks, but Hassnawi contends that the only way to defeat the insurgents is for soldiers from Iraq's new army to enter the city, backed up by American forces. He warns that US troops should not repeat their mistake in April by going it alone. Fallujans, he said, \"will accept Iraqi soldiers on their streets, but not the American Marines\".</p> <p>The sheikh fears that the Iraqi and US leaders will back off yet again from their resolve to expel militants from the city before national elections scheduled for January. Unless that expulsion happens, he maintains, the Sunnis will be disenfranchised by the new political system. An inability to vote in January, he said, will breed enmity among even those Fallujans who support Iraq's democratic transition.</p> <p>As we ended our conversation, Hassnawi was despondent. To console him, I said I'd be back one day and that we would share another lunch of Haji Hussein kebabs. But last week I got an e-mail from Naseer informing me that US warplanes had bombed the restaurant.

  "A high-profile lawyer, best known for representing the murderer Tracie Andrews, had already served a jail sentence for masterminding a multi-million pound legal aid fraud, it was revealed today. <p>Solicitor Timothy Robinson, now 60, was convicted in 2001 of conspiring to systematically defraud the legal aid system of huge sums of cash over a period of almost six years. As well as being sentenced to seven years in jail, he was ordered to pay more than \u00a31m in compensation and costs. </p> <p>Details of the case were only allowed to be published today after the conclusion of a related case resulted in the lifting of reporting restrictions.</p> <p>Robinson, who lived in the exclusive village of Badgeworth, near Cheltenham, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud at Bristol Crown Court in January 2001 following an eight-month trial. He was released on parole in July after serving half his sentence.</p> <p>A further 21 former employees at his Gloucestershire-based practice, Robinson's, either pleaded guilty or were found guilty of the conspiracy in a total of five trials. Five were acquitted and charges against two lie on the file. </p> <p>The investigation into the firm's activities began more than 10 years ago in April 1993 and is thought to have cost several million pounds. The Serious Fraud Office and three police forces took more than 3,000 witness statements and seized 21 tonnes of documents from the firm's offices as they investigated the scam. </p> <p>The conspiracy involved employees at the firm, once regarded as one of the largest criminal defence practices in the country, claiming legal aid for millions of pounds' worth of work they did not do. </p> <p>Reporting restrictions were lifted after the charges against the remaining defendant, Archibald Ross, were ordered to lie on the file after medical evidence showed that the trial was unlikely ever to go ahead. </p> <p>It is not known exactly how much was defrauded from the Legal Aid Board, but estimates suggest it could have been as much as half the \u00a317m claimed by the firm during the period investigated. </p> <p>At Robinson's trial, the court heard that the scam centred on the green forms which were used by law firms to claim for certain types of legal aid work. One of the solicitor's former employees said that up to 90% of the green forms submitted by the firm's Cheltenham office were fraudulent. </p> <p>The jury was told time spent with clients was exaggerated, prison visits were claimed twice, clerks billed for cases which had never existed and crimes that clients may have mentioned in passing, but never wanted advice on, were put down in claims form. </p> <p>When police searched the offices, they found 197 forms that had been signed by clients but were not filled in. Some employees were claiming for work totalling more than 24 hours a day, the court heard. </p> <p>Many forms submitted were claims for things such as \"perusal and consideration\" which \"was often the code for not actually doing any work\", the jury at Robinson's trial was told. </p> <p>The firm's clerks, who were earning a basic salary of \u00a310,000 a year, were paid up to \u00a34,500 a month overtime and were given Mercedes cars with personalised number plates such as 4LAW or 7LAW. </p> <p>But the court heard that one fee-earning clerk, former book maker Richard Hill, became reckless and started to forge clients' signatures. The Law Society became suspicious and Hill eventually resigned and blew the whistle. He was later jailed for 14 months for his part in the conspiracy. </p> <p>Ian Glen QC, prosecuting, said Robinson was described by one of his clerks as \"a mini-Maxwell, obsessed with power and money\". He added: \"Mr Robinson himself was very careful not to dirty his own hands. He got others to commit the frauds with those green forms... It was his fee-earning clerks who did the dirty work.\" </p> <p>Robinson, a well-known figure in the south-west where he had practised since the early 1970s, was in the headlines in 1997 when he represented Tracie Andrews - the woman who was eventually found guilty of murdering her 25-year-old fiance Lee Harvey on a roadside near their home in Alvechurch, near Redditch. </p> <p>He always denied knowing the fraud was going on at his firm, denied ever filling in green forms dishonestly and denied asking anyone in his office to do so. After Robinson was found guilty, his barrister, David Etherington QC, asked the judge to consider \"the utter ruin and devastation that this defendant now faces\".</p> <p>Judge David Smith heard the SFO had traced assets belonging to Robinson or his wife totalling \u00a31.6m and that the lawyer had taken about \u00a33m from his firm in the period 1991 to 1999. The court was told the trial had cost around \u00a33 million. </p> <p>The judge imposed a confiscation order on Robinson of \u00a3532,275 which he ordered to be paid as compensation to what is now called the Legal Services Commission. He also decided he should pay \u00a3500,000 in prosecution costs. Robinson appealed against his conviction and then his sentence in October 2002, but lost both appeals. </p> <p>After the hearing, Detective Inspector Paul Yateman, senior investigating officer, said the investigation had been \"a remarkable inquiry which had exposed a den of corruption and fraudulent activity\". </p> <p>He said: \"The manpower, time and materials involved in this investigation have been immense and this was certainly the longest full-time investigation ever carried out by our force, and must surely be one of the longest ever carried out in Britain.\"</p>",
  "<p>Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance that will be enshrined in law.</p> <p>Ministers will unveil an amendment to the children bill next week which will set a statutory minimum level of allowance which all local authorities must stick to.</p> <p>But an announcement is awaited from the Department of Education and Skills on what the minimum level will be.</p> <p>Robert Tapsfield, executive director of charity the Fostering Network, said: \"There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live.</p> <p>\"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.\"</p> <p>Mr Tapsfield said he would be lobbying for the government to back his charity's recommendation of a weekly payment of \u00a3108.49 for looking after a baby, with higher rates in London and for older children. Figures released earlier this year by the charity showed that many authorities were paying far less than this level, and in some cases neighbouring councils' rates varied by as much as \u00a3100 per week. Some councils pay as little as \u00a350 a week.</p> <p>The shortage of foster carers in the UK has now reached more than 8,000, a 35% rise on the last survey in 2002.</p> <p>Carers working for 46% of English local authorities receive allowances below the charity's recommended minimum rates, meaning they have to subsidise the cost of bringing up their charges. Government guidance currently states that all carers should be reimbursed for the full costs of fostering. But no level is set and there are no punishments if the council does not comply.</p> <p>The Commons will discuss the children bill for the final time on Tuesday. Smacking is expected to dominate debate but the children's minister, Margaret Hodge, will ensure there is time to discuss the fostering amendment.</p> <p>She has rejected calls to beef up the bill to allow the establishment of a compulsory register of private foster carers immediately. Instead, the government will be given the power to set one up within four years if a new scheme which will encourage private foster carers to voluntarily register with their councils does not work. Hodge has said she is not minded to support a register.</p> <p>And there is nothing in the bill on paying foster carers a salary for their skills, on top of allowances which only cover the cost of bring up children. That is likely to be the next campaign for the Fostering Network.</p>",
  "<p>Alsop Architects, one of Britain's most colourful and internationally renowned practices, has been forced into receivership by a financial crisis. </p> <p>Directors of the practice headed by the outspoken architect and artist Will Alsop have sold 40% of the business to R Capital, a London-based firm of venture capitalists, as part of a rescue plan after a string of dramatic and costly projects worldwide came to nothing, according to a report in today's Building Design magazine. </p> <p>Alsop has been the driving force behind a plethora of media-grabbing projects, including the intended transformation of Barnsley into a semblance of a Tuscan hill town, the planned creation of a \"mega-city\" for 15 million people linking existing settlements across the north of England, and the rebranding of Middlesbrough with proposed blocks of flats shaped like Prada skirts. </p> <p>Another of his plans, the Fourth Grace, a multi-purpose, multi-coloured blob on Liverpool's Pier Head waterfront, was rejected earlier this autumn, much to Alsop's fury. Other cancelled projects include a millennium complex in Bangkok and an \"urban village\" in east Manchester. </p> <p>Alsop laid off 25 architects in the summer before the crisis deepened and James Allen, his managing director, left the firm. Design director Christopher Egret, project architect of Alsop's award-winning Peckham Library, has also quit to set up his own practice. </p> <p>Under the new structure, a new company, Alsop Design Limited, will trade as Alsop &amp; Partners with Alsop, fellow architect Stephen Pimbley, a new managing director, Colin Gilmore-Merchant, and investors in control. </p> <p>Alsop insists that the direction of the practice will not change.\"We had already decided that our future lies in North America, the Far East and Moscow, because there's not much happening in our traditional hunting grounds in Europe ... the message is we are in great shape and we are well-funded,\" he said. </p> <p>The 57-year-old architect has long courted controversy. He believes that most British architecture lacks risk-taking artistry, and is not much fun. Fun is a word that has gone down well with a number of northern towns, cities and regeneration agencies in recent months as Bradford, Barnsley, Halifax, Stoke-on-Trent and Middlesbrough have sought to throw off the dour images they still unfairly conjure in the popular imagination. </p> <p>This summer Alsop promised that he would transform Middlesbrough into \"a landscape inhabited by 21st-century icons\" including a cinema in the guise of a Rubik's Cube and a cartoon-like 10-storey office block resembling Marge Simpson's hair. </p> <p>His larger-than-life imprint can be seen in his North Greenwich tube station and vivid blue Peckham Library, and abroad in such wacky designs as the Hotel du Departement, Marseille, a tourist attraction as well as a seat of local government, and in the Sharp Centre for Design, a black and white box on stilts straddling the existing buildings of the Ontario College of Art and Design. It was described by the judges of Riba's 2004 Worldwide Award as \"courageous, bold and just a little insane\".</p>",
  "<p>The producer, studio head, marketer, etc, have one criterion, and that is the gross; but the film-maker, along with his audience, has many ways to gauge delight. </p> <p>He may cherish a film, a shot, a performance, a line - indeed, a gesture (Brando shrugging at the beginning of The Godfather, Sylvia Sidney's smile in An American Tragedy). </p> <p>Here are some of my petted and oft-visited delights. </p> <p>Richard Dreyfuss, his pickup truck stopped at a railroad crossing in Close Encounters. A car's headlights are seen behind him; he looks down to check his map and the car's headlights behind him rise. This is great film-making, and the essence of film-making: to tell the story through pictures. The shot elicits a gasp, which - like the laugh, but unlike applause, reviews, or the gross - cannot be extorted. </p> <p>I name: Marcel Dalio exhibiting his steam calliope to the houseguests in La R\u00e8gle du Jeu; Buster Keaton, frantically shovelling wood into the boiler of The General, as his fiancee, ever helpful, takes a splinter and dusts it before handing it to him. He does the world's most sublime take, mooting, serially, homicide, forgiveness, and resignation in a half-second. Henry Fonda, framed in the light of an opening door, as he wins his first big case as Young Mr Lincoln, the light as the beginning of his apotheosis as our American Saint. The shot (in both Stairway to Heaven and One of Our Aircraft Is Missing) of the control yoke of a British bomber, tied down, an empty cockpit, the plane flying on autopilot after its crew has jumped. Silvana Mangano, in Gold of Naples, deciding to accept the degradation of life with a man who has married her, a prostitute, out of penance. </p> <p>I name the chance encounter between Walter Huston and Mary Astor, in the American Express office in Naples in Dodsworth - a perfect silent scene. The opening of The Seven Samurai. The long walk between Diane Keaton and Al Pacino in The Godfather. The duel in Colonel Blimp. The final love scene in Monty Clift's death cell, when Elizabeth Taylor comes to tell him goodbye, in A Place in the Sun. Cagney dancing to Give My Regards to Broadway, in Yankee Doodle Dandy. Audrey Hepburn, greeting the Gypsy band hired to play, behind a screen, during her trysts with Gary Cooper, with \"Good evening, gentlemen\", in Love in the Afternoon. Each of these moments occurs in a film I could watch, quite literally, once a week. And, if you are unacquainted with them, I recommend them unreservedly. </p> <p>I name also the delights of the music of Dimitri Tiomkin - his perfect score for Shadow of a Doubt, in effect, defining \"suspense music\". Alfred Newman's Ann Rutledge theme (used by Ford in both Young Mr Lincoln and The Searchers), the essence of loss. Elmer Bernstein's Magnificent Seven theme, which embodies, and ineluctably forever signifies, cowboys. Nino Rota's Godfather theme. And, of course, the great Henry Mancini, whose music helped to create something far beyond mood, a unity between sound and picture - eg Moon River, in Breakfast at Tiffany's, the nostalgia theme in Two for the Road, The Pink Panther, Charade, etc. (My friend, the great sound recordist Jonathan Pritchett, teaches that there never was such a thing as a silent movie - that, from the first, from the silent days, films were accompanied by a pit orchestra or a piano player; they were always meant to be enjoyed with sound.) </p> <p>Consider the Albioni requiem in Platoon, and the Blue Danube in 2001; the duelling banjos in Deliverance; and Maurice Jarre's beatification of sand in Lawrence of Arabia. </p> <p>Call me an aficionado, but I get all giddy over Ken Adam's zero-gravity toilet on the space station in 2001, and his perfectly worn \"secret code\" enunciator in Dr Strangelove. The Maltese Falcon is a great prop, as is Alan Ladd's ivory-handled peacemaker in Shane. These talismans define their genre: they do not simply narrate, they dramatise - they act synergistically, not explaining, but creating an unconscious, that is to say, artistic, experience. </p> <p>Have I gone too far? I don't think so. Just as, for 50 years, no actor could but imitate Brando, so, for a decade afterward, no city girl could other than dress like Ann Roth's Annie Hall. The butchest ride around was Steve McQueen's green Mustang in Bullitt, and all future space explorers must adopt the casual Hawaiian-shirt ambiance of costume designer John Mollo's clothes in Alien. </p> <p>We're told that French intellectuals and artistes - from the 1920s and, still, today - display those black, perfectly round eyeglasses, the temples set in the middle of the circle, in homage to Harold Lloyd. And it is fairly plan that George Bush's \"Bring it on\" is an imitation of Reagan's \"Make my day\", which was a quote from Joseph Stinson's screenplay for Sudden Impact. </p> <p>Lines (and titles) have entered our language, and seem intent on remaining. \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it any more\" - Paddy Chayevsky's brilliant line in Network. \"It goes up to 11\" - Chris Guest's improvisation in Spinal Tap. \"Make him an offer he can't refuse\" - Mario Puzo, The Godfather. \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn\" - by one of the myriad writers of Gone with the Wind. The eponymous Wag the Dog. And so on. </p> <p>To the film-maker and the film viewer, the delights of film are many; but the merchant is restricted in his pleasures to the missionary position - the mission, always attended by anxiety, a trip to the bank. </p> <p>\u00a9 2004 David Mamet.</p>",
  "<p>Adjudicators were called in to settle more disputes than ever over pupil admissions to schools in England, said a report to the education secretary, Charles Clarke, today.</p> <p>Too many schools were failing to follow their own procedures and in too many cases the rules on admissions were unclear or too elaborate, reported the chief schools adjudicator, Philip Hunter, in his annual report for the last academic year. He said people were now better informed about arrangements for their local schools and were in a better position to challenge them and local education authorities.</p> <p>In 2003/04 there were 270 cases referred to the 11 schools adjudicators - mostly ex-chief education officers, inspectors and academics. This compared to 233 cases the previous year and 78 in 2001/02. Of last year's total, 171 of them were objections to admission arrangements, 47 were for variations to admission arrangements and 51 were statutory proposals. </p> <p>Dr Hunter said: \"Procedures for determining admission arrangements and reorganising schools are now more transparent than they have ever been. People locally are better informed and are in a position to object to proposals by schools or LEAs. It is perhaps inevitable that adjudicators are being called in to settle more disputes. Many admission forums and school organisation committees are becoming more effective and I hope we can look forward to the time when they are dealing with more of these matters.\"</p> <p>Many admission forums were now working well, said Dr Hunter. \"They have successfully agreed co-ordinated admission arrangements for their areas and LEAs are administering them satisfactorily. Forums are now becoming more engaged in policy matters.\"</p> <p>But he warned that too many schools were failing to follow the procedures for making admission arrangements laid down in regulations, despite offers from LEAs to help administer them. \"Too many admission criteria are not clear or are too elaborate. Admission forums, LEAs and church authorities should give firmer guidance to schools about the need for admission arrangements that are easily understood by parents,\" he added.</p> <p>The report noted 41 objections were to criteria giving priority to children of staff or children with siblings in other schools and adjudicators upheld most of these. </p> <p>Schools adjudicators are independent of the government. They decide on school organisation issues and admission arrangements that cannot be resolved locally. They were appointed under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Their role is to look afresh at all cases referred to them, considering each case on its merits and taking account of the reasons for disagreement at local level in the light of the legislation and the guidance in the Code of Practice on Schools Admissions. </p> <p>The report will be placed on the <a href=\"http://www.gnn.gov.uk\" target_new\">public section</a> of the site at on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>For her new exhibition, Sam Taylor-Wood has made two pieces of video art. \"Strings\" is a nine-minute film of a man hanging by wires over a string quartet, making swimming movements in time to the music. He is dressed in a loin-cloth. \"Ascension\" features a man tap dancing on the prone body of another man, while balancing a live bird on his head. The piece ends when the bird gets fed up and flies off. I watch both in a viewing room on the top floor of the White Cube Gallery, owned by Taylor-Wood's husband Jay Jopling, which is that morning experiencing a crisis in waste disposal: bin bags pile up in the corridor because the cleaners have failed to take out the rubbish after mistaking it for an exhibit. </p> <p>There are two widely-held assumptions about Taylor-Wood - that she is posh and that she is more interested in celebrity than art, ranking somewhere between Salman Rushdie and Sadie Frost on the London party circuit. The first is untrue; she grew up in south London before moving with her mother and stepfather (hence the two surnames) to a hippy commune in Crowborough, East Sussex. The second puts unfair weight on her social life and on her portrait of a sleeping David Beckham, the success of which, she says, is more exposing of shallow newspaper values than of anything cynical in her choice of subject matter. It is a position her new show will make hard to defend. Alongside Strings and Ascension, Taylor-Wood exhibits Crying Men, a set of photos in which she gets famous actors to cry for the camera. It is presented as a discourse on authenticity, as a challenge to see Jude Law, Dustin Hoffman, Benicio del Toro and Paul Newman among others, in a \"different light\". To what end, however, it is not entirely clear. </p> <p>Around the corner from the White Cube is Taylor-Wood's studio, a loft-like space ruled by her bulldog, Sid. \"Sid, bugger off,\" she tells him. She is less stern than expected and more apprehensive, a young-looking 37 with TV presenter bounce. Eight years ago, she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Four years after that, she underwent a mastectomy for breast cancer. Interpretations of her art are often forced to align with the knowledge of these experiences. In such a light, Crying Men is a treatise on sadness, Still Life, in which a bowl of fruit is filmed slowly rotting away, is about life's transience, and Ascension, I guess, is something to do with the departure of the soul. But that's not how it works, says Taylor-Wood. Most of her art doesn't grow out of a central idea and she finds it difficult, now, to explain where it all came from. </p> <p>\"I don't really think like that. I always say, and I truly believe this, that my work is three steps ahead of me. I have an idea for something and I tend to feel like it's leading me and I'll follow the process through and it's not until after I've seen it that I truly understand why I'm doing this. And so [in Crying Men] I wanted to work with actors and look at the authenticity of that emotion and to be aware that, when you look at portraits everyone is very composed and I just wanted to break that composure a little bit and make them a bit more human, especially people of such familiarity and calibre; to make them a little bit more real.\" </p> <p>But they're actors; isn't it fair to assume they are acting? </p> <p>\"Well, one of them said to me, 'Someone says we're all really good liars, but I feel that my job is to tell the truth and my emotions are quite close to the surface, so I can access them really quickly.' There is no doubt in my mind that they're crying proper tears and that what I've triggered is probably them calling on a resource of a memory.\" This sounds to me like the very definition of acting. </p> <p>The dog comes up, sniffing. \"Sid! Bugger off.\" </p> <p>Crying Men is in part about the demystification of celebrity. But so what? Aren't celebrities being demystified every day in the gossip columns? \"What are you saying, that it's over and that I shouldn't be doing it?\" </p> <p>I just wonder what more there is to be said about them. </p> <p>\"It's much more that I'm interested in the authenticity of emotions and how we project them and also how we look at cinema. People fixate on the fact that it's celebrity without thinking that it's also about what that emotion means. Demystification is a little part of it, but not the whole thing.\" </p> <p>Does she consider celebrity photographers such as Mario Testino to be artists? </p> <p>\"Ugh,\" she says, \"don't pull me into that one. Next.\" </p> <p>It is odd that Taylor-Wood has come to stand for the coolest end of the arts world; her early experiences with it were unhappy precisely because she wasn't in-crowd enough. After school she enrolled at the North East London polytechnic, which she hated. \"They were obsessed by Picasso and people like that and expected us to make that kind of work and it just felt wrong. At that age you think you're supremely intelligent and I wanted to be a conceptual artist. I didn't want to be a painter or a sculptor.\" </p> <p>She transferred to Goldsmiths, which, if anything, was worse. She compares it to a \"Swiss finishing school,\"and says she \"just pottered along\" actively hoping not to get noticed. \"I made these mindless wooden boxes to look busy all the time.\" After graduating she got a job as a dresser at the Royal Opera House, and then as manager of the Camden Palace nightclub, a turning point in as much as it made her realise how no amount of failure as an artist could equal the misery of working in a job she hated. </p> <p>\"It really frightened me and made me think I've got to get off my arse and do something and not just sort of float around. If I want to be an artist, go and do it now.\" </p> <p>Almost 10 years later, when she became ill with cancer, Taylor-Wood would return in her mind to this time and wonder if the stress had been a contributing factor. \"You try to figure out what could have caused it. You think, was it because I used to drink too much? Or stay up too late?\" </p> <p>By then she was an established artist and the mother of a baby girl, Angelica, now seven. She coped by trying to pretend that everything was normal, even after a major operation to remove a section of her colon. \"I was up and about far too fast. And the second time I got ill, I just shut down for a year. I thought, I'm going to go through the chemotherapy and everything that I usually put creatively outwards, I'm going to put inwards. I didn't go out for a year and a half.\" </p> <p>For the last session of chemotherapy, all her friends came into hospital with her. \"And the nurse couldn't find a vein, and it was so painful. And so she was digging this bloody needle in me about 15 or 20 times. My veins would literally run away, they'd get hard and roll away. And the thing is, everyone thinks when you've finished your treatment that's the end of it. But the emotional leftovers of it stay with your for such a long time.\" </p> <p>The main leftover is \"mostly fear\", she says. She lived like an ill person for a long time after she got the all-clear, and still feels vulnerable. Whenever she gets a cold, she fears the worst. Every three months she goes for check-ups and blood tests. But she has started to go out again and to live something resembling her old life. The self-portraits included in the new exhibition depict her suspended in mid-air, in positions halfway between kung-fu fighting and ballet. Her next project is a film about William Blake, which she is making with her friend Ray Winstone (also one of the Crying Men). </p> <p>Is beauty in her art a goal? </p> <p>\"No, I don't think so. No, not really. You have a certain eye for things. When I was out in Georgia doing photographs, I found myself trying to undo my own sense of composition. I'd think, 'Why do I want to take it like this? Is it because I want to take a beautiful picture?' It's quite hard to try and undo it.\" </p> <p>And what about Ascension? What does it mean, one guy tap dancing on another guy with a bird on his head? Is the guy on the floor supposed to be dead? </p> <p>\"I wanted him to look like he was dead, unconscious, asleep, whatever ... it was just left open. The interpretation could be anything from highly religious - a trinity - to just a man asleep and someone doing tap dancing; just a strange image. I try to leave things as open ended as possible, not too overladen with meaning. It's either there or it's not.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fathers 4 Justice protestors have overpowered police and stormed a conference on family law, setting off smoke bombs and flares and forcing the evacuation of the building.</p> <p>The fathers' rights group was hoping to get the chance to remonstrate with the children and families minister, Lord Filkin, outside the conference venue, which is next to the Regent's canal in north London. </p> <p>The group's spokesman, Matt O'Connor, told SocietyGuardian.co.uk that the minister could have found himself \"in at the deep end\".</p> <p>Acting on a tip-off, the police stationed three divers and a dinghy in the canal as a precaution, and more than 30 policemen were brought in to guard the conference centre.</p> <p>But the group's plan to confront Lord Filkin was thwarted by the fact that he had been reshuffled out of his family law role in September. His replacement, Baroness Ashton, addressed the conference before the protestors arrived.</p> <p>The protest began at 11.30 when two men, one an able-bodied man in a wheelchair, had attempted to gain access to the conference run by the charity Children Law UK, after registering as members of a bogus organisation.</p> <p>Their names were passed on to the Metropolitan police who identified them as members of the group Fathers 4 Justice, and they were turned away at the door. </p> <p>The plan had been for the man in the wheelchair to \"stage a miraculous recovery\" in the conference hall and disrupt the meeting, said Mr O'Connor.</p> <p>Fifteen policemen and police divers had been drafted in after the organisers got wind of the operation: but at lunchtime 15 protestors overpowered police on the door and set off flares in the foyer.</p> <p>Fire alarms were set off, forcing the building, which is home to the National Council of Voluntary Organisations, to be evacuated.</p> <p>Around 20 extra police were brought in and prevented the men from gaining access to the conference hall. Eight men were arrested.</p> <p>The conference has now restarted and is due to be addressed by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the head of the family division at the high court.</p> <p>Mr O'Connor said: \"We have had a protest outside the family law conference. Unfortunately our original plan was rumbled but we got 15 people inside and flares were set off after two policemen were overpowered.</p> <p>\"There are policemen in a dinghy on the canal. The conference has restarted but we want to make as much noise as possible.\"</p> <p>He said the stunt was prompted by an interview with Lord Filkin published in the Guardian yesterday, in which the minister described as \"wet\" those fathers who did not persist in getting contact with their children after the first knockback. </p> <p>\"Well, we are beside a canal,\" said Mr O'Connor. \"He could have been in at the deep end.\"</p> <p>Glyn Farrow, the spokesman for the conference organisers, said: \"Children Law UK appreciates the experience of fathers who have been unable to maintain contact with their children.</p> <p>\"Events such as ours are designed to explore all possibilities as to how such contact may be maintained.</p> <p>\"It is a shame that seminars such as this which aim to highlight possible improvements to current practice should be disrupted. This has the impact of delaying discussion and debate which may lead to changes in current practice that could lead to improvements for fathers in future cases.\"</p> <p>He said the fire alarm was set off during a speech by John Baker of Families Need Fathers, another group campaigning for greater access for fathers in contact cases.</p>",
  "<p>Chelsea have sacked striker Adrian Mutu after the Romanian international failed a drug test and admitted he had taken cocaine. The Stamford Bridge club terminated the player's contract on the grounds of gross misconduct, effectively writing off \u00a312m - the player's current worth on their books. </p> <p>Peter Kenyon, the club's chief executive, this afternoon revealed that Chelsea had deliberately singled Mutu out for a test after his behaviour and poor performances aroused their suspicions. </p> <p>\"A clinical assessment over time led us to believe that his behaviour could be associated with drugs,\" said Kenyon, \"the contract is quite explicit that taking any form of drugs is gross misconduct and will lead to dismissal. \" </p> <p>Kenyon added: \"We believe in zero tolerance - the manager has to have the confidence of his players. We've got to look after the interests of Chelsea and it's important to make a statement on a very important issue in sport.\" </p> <p>The club had earlier released a similar statement stressing the high moral reasons for firing the blank-shooting striker. \"In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club's social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company.</p> <p>\"Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as FA rules.

  "Paul Smith was bullied as \"the odd kid\" for all 11 years he spent at school, struggling with a form of autism, but yesterday, as he started a life sentence for stripping and smothering a child ballet star, he was revealed as a repeat attacker of young girls. <p>After nine hours, a jury at Nottingham Crown court convicted the 18-year-old, who has Asperger's syndrome and whose stilted speech and learning difficulties singled him out for mockery, of killing Rosie May Storrie, 10, at a Christmas party in Normanton, Leicestershire. </p> <p>They only then learned details of other incidents including how he had previously forced another girl into a car boot at gunpoint, after gagging her and tying her up. </p> <p>But none of the victims brought charges and all the incidents were unknown to the little girl's family when they chatted with friends at the party while she teased and joked with him. </p> <p>Her parents, Graham and Mary Storrie, made an appeal for more openness about potentially violent people, whatever their problems. \"Quiet knowledge\" of Smith's background would have saved their daughter, who was starring in local pantomime and had won an offer of a place at the English Ballet School which arrived two days after her murder. </p> <p>Mrs Storrie, 42, who runs a nanny agency and has two sons, said: \"We feel that not only Paul Smith's parents but the parents of the girl who was abducted and the parents of the girl who was assaulted - if any of those parents had chosen to stick their neck out and be accountable then prevention could have occurred.\" </p> <p>Mr Storrie, 45 and a fabric technician, said: \"It is a warning to other people who think they can cover up these sorts of things within the family. If there had been some honesty, even a quiet warning to watch Paul Smith, we would still have Rosie May with us.\" </p> <p>His parents, Nigel and Susan, who have another son and a daughter at university, said in a statement: \"We are deeply upset and shocked by this verdict. We remain convinced that Paul played no part in Rosie May's death and we will continue the fight to clear his name. It has appeared that the most vulnerable has been selected as the easy target.\" </p> <p>The three week trial heard that Smith had shown an interest in the \"pretty and bubbly\" Rosie May when she arrived wearing a black catsuit and talked to him while playing a computer game about relationships. He was the last person seen with her before she was found smothered in a bedroom with her clothes round her legs. </p> <p>Setting a minimum term of 14 years in jail, Mr Justice Astill told Smith, who worked at his uncle's business in Sedgebrook, Lincolnshire: \"I am sure that you are, and have been for some time, a considerable danger to young girls. </p> <p>\"I do not know if this disturbing part of your personality arises from the condition from which you undoubtedly suffer. </p> <p>\"But you made a determined attack upon this young child long enough and forceful enough to overcome the considerable struggle which she put up to survive, to prevent you from suffocating her. I have no doubt that your reason was sexual.\" </p> <p>The court heard that Smith's condition made him nervous and unhappy at crowded gatherings such as the Christmas party. </p> <p>But Mrs Storrie overheard him say, \"I feel like a sexual [being]\" when Rosie May arrived, took off her fleece and revealed her catsuit. </p> <p>Later on in the evening, he was seen by another young guest chasing the child upstairs after she grabbed a beer can from him and danced off. The drink was found by Rosie's body with traces of DNA from both her and Smith. </p> <p>Mr Justice Astill said: \"Your comments about feeling sexual when she was attracting attention demonstrated that your feelings built up during the course of that evening. I cannot give you the benefit of good character because of your previous attacks on young girls but I do take into account the disability from which you suffer.\" After the verdict, the court heard how Smith had lost his temper two years before Rosie's death last December, when a girl from his school was chatting in his bedroom and started talking about exams. He threatened her with his air rifle before taping her mouth and legs, forcing her into a car boot and driving off. </p> <p>Suddenly overcome with remorse, he then released her, before swerving away and crashing into another car. Mr Justice Astill ruled that the episode should not be put to the jury because the hallmarks were not the same as in the attack on Rosie May. Smith admitted attacking the 16-year-old when interviewed by officers but the matter was never pursued at the request of his victim. </p> <p>In a statement, the girl's family said: \"She would never speak to Paul again but she didn't want to bring charges against her childhood friend. </p> <p>\"We were unaware of the other incidents at the time and only heard about them when the police came to see us following the death. I do know that Paul never apologised for what he did that day.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the National Autistic Society said: \"There would be no reason to suspect that someone with Asperger's Syndrome would be likely to be more aggressive towards other people than any other person of a similar age </p> <p>\"We get more issues around people with Asperger's Syndrome being bullied than being bullies. But if someone with Asperger's Syndrome did become aggressive that would be complicated by the fact that they might not be able to understand the consequences\".</p>",
  "<p>The corridors of the United Nations headquarters in New York have been buzzing in the last week with a debate on human cloning that could determine the future direction of medical research for years to come. </p> <p>When delegates return in less than a fortnight, they will be asked to reach a conclusion on one of the most difficult ethical questions they have faced: should human cloning be banned? </p> <p>It is a heady subject. Many scientists see human cloning as an important step towards producing an unlimited supply of stem cells genetically identical to a patient. That in turn raises the possibility of curing a multitude of untreatable diseases. Pro-life groups say it simply devalues human life. </p> <p>At the centre of this ideological maelstrom stands Alison Murdoch, one of only two people in Britain who can clone human embryos legally. </p> <p>A fertility expert at the Centre for Life, an IVF clinic in Newcastle, she also heads the British Fertility Association and is an honourary clinical lecturer at the University of Newcastle. </p> <p>For decades she has helped women who would otherwise have found it difficult to conceive. </p> <p>But now she wants her work to go further and touch the edge of medicine: with her patients' consent, she will collect the unused eggs left over from fertility treatments and use them to clone human embryos for research. </p> <p>From these cloned embryos, her team of researchers want to extract stem cells, the body's master cells which have the ability to turn into any tissue. </p> <p>\"She's doing revolutionary research that asks basic questions about what is life and what is death, the fundamental problems that most people dodge and don't want to talk about, she is not frightened to talk about,\" said Ian Gibson, chairman of the House of Commons science and technology select committee. </p> <p>The fertility scientist Lord Robert Winston describes Professor Murdoch as \"an exemplary humanitarian. She has great compassion for patients, she is a very kind person and she's also a very good doctor\". </p> <p>But that has not placated pro-life groups such as Comment on Reproductive Ethics, who take issue with the fact that Prof Murdoch is an expert in infertility, not human disease. </p> <p>They say she has no authority on whether stem cells derived from cloned embryos will cure, for example, diabetes or other degenerative diseases. </p> <p>\"She's never published anything on human cloning. In fact, apart from infertility and conditions relating to infertility, she's never published any paper on strategies for tackling any disease whatsoever,\" said Elliott Cannell, a Core spokesperson. </p> <p>\"I think she's exploiting people with disease because she's offering them false hope. She's using people's misfortune and suffering to justify her own research agenda.\" </p> <p>Many countries have buried their heads in the sand but Britain has taken decisive steps on cloning. Here, it is legal to clone human embryos for research purposes (so-called therapeutic cloning) but it is illegal to clone babies (a technique known as reproductive cloning). </p> <p>Licences for cloning work are hard to get. The application and vetting process carried out by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the government agency that regulates reproductive medical research, can take up to a year to process. </p> <p>Prof Murdoch was granted a licence with her colleague, Dr Miodrag Stojkavic, an embryologist at the University of Newcastle, in August </p> <p>She is clear why she was given a licence. \"If you're actually going to talk about getting eggs and embryos, and only the scientists are talking about it, then you've lost that clinical touch,\" she told the New York Times earlier this month. \"And I don't think it's by chance alone that I hold the first licence to do this work in the UK. I'm a clinician, not a scientist.\" </p> <p>Her team will build on work published by South Korean scientists in February. A team led by Professor Hwang Woo-suk, a veterinarian at Seoul National University, announced they had cloned a human embryo and extracted stem cells from it: a first that has inspired other scientists to follow. </p> <p>The common refrain on stem cells, most famously used in the US election campaign, is that they will someday be used to develop cures for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. </p> <p>Unfortunately, they are difficult to produce, even in the limited numbers needed for research. Scientists hope that cloning human embryos will provide a good source of these specialised cells. </p> <p>Not that cloning is easy, either. The procedure involves taking the nucleus of genetic material out of an unfertilised egg and inserting that of the person whose cells will actually be cloned. The egg is then induced to divide using either chemicals or an electrical charge. </p> <p>If successful, the egg will turn into a ball of cells called a blastocyst within a week and researchers can extract the embryonic stem cells. Prof Murdoch's role is to look after the welfare of the people who are being asked to donate eggs. If all goes well, the clinic expects that up to 2,000 eggs could be available for research over the next year. </p> <p>But not every one believes that the hard work is a good idea. </p> <p>\"We should be very alarmed indeed,\" says Josephine Quintavalle, director of Core. </p> <p>\"There's a very clear conflict of interest there - IVF clinics are providing the primary material the researchers need. What guarantees are there that the patients are being protected?\" </p> <p>Prof Murdoch recognises this: patients considering donating eggs have the services of a dedicated nurse that provides any scientific background that people might want. Crucially, the nurse is independent of the research team. </p> <p>Suzi Leather, the HFEA's chief executive, said Prof Murdoch and Dr Stojkovic were granted a licence \"after careful consideration of all the scientific, ethical, legal and medical aspects of the project. This is an important area of research and a responsible use of technology.\" </p> <p>Mr Cannell believes the HFEA has made a mistake and is planning to force a judicial review of the application process with a view to getting the licence withdrawn </p> <p>But Prof Murdoch's work does not concern the authorities. </p> <p>Next month she will appear before the science select committee as part of their investigation into what, if any, legislation is necessary from the explosion in stem cell research. </p> <p>\"She's that important to us,\" said Dr Gibson. \"She is determined, world-class, solid and I'm looking forward to politicising her even more heavily,\" </p> <p>Prof Murdoch is no stranger to justifying her team's work and is a regular on the lecture circuit, explaining to the public exactly what she does and why she does it. </p> <p>\"Her belief is that what we are doing is very promising and could help us to understand and cure diseases. You leave the people to decide whether this is a good idea,\" said Dr Stojkovic. </p> <p>Prof Murdoch is determined to see the work go ahead. \"It's the will of parliament, it's the will of the Department of Health and it's the will of the public that this work go ahead,\" she told the New York Times. </p> <p>The public lectures do not stop the occasional unsubstantiated rumour, though. </p> <p>\"Somebody speculated that if a patient gives us eggs or embryos, that they will get cheaper treatment,\" said Dr Stojkovic. \"This is nonsense.\" </p> <p>The sporadic criticisms have not dimmed public support for the work. \"If patients are convinced that this is something good, and they would like to contribute for research, they give us embryos,\" said Dr Stojkovic. </p> <p>He pointed out that more than 60% of the patients at the clinic have so far been willing to donate eggs. </p> <p>The success of Prof Murdoch's application has also spurred on others. </p> <p>Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, the man who cloned Dolly the sheep, announced recently that he had put in his application to the HFEA for a licence to clone human embryos. </p> <p>Dr Simon Fishel, a pioneer of the IVF technique in the 1970s and now director of the Centre for Assisted Reproduction in Nottingham says Prof Murdoch's role in managing the ethical, clinical and the scientific aspects of her team's cloning research fitted her perfectly. </p> <p>\"What you need at the helm is somebody who can juggle the patients and society and regulatory issues while ensuring that you have a number of good scientists who can do the work,\" he said. </p> <p>\"If she is leading a team, I would have little fear.\" </p> <p>For Dr Gibson, Prof Murdoch is a role model for scientists. </p> <p>\"She's prepared to try new things. She has a scientific spirit and doesn't mind criticisms and she's had a fair bit of that. She's tough and rough,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Age 54 </p> <p><strong> <strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> Founded the department of reproductive medicine at Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle in 1991.

  "The 25 leaders of the European Union today signed the EU's first constitution, in the Rome palace which saw the creation of the original common market 47 years ago. <p>The illustrious ceremony, hosted by the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, leaves the treaty with two years to be ratified by each member-state, either through their national parliaments or individual referendums - leaving its eventual enactment in doubt.</p> <p>The 300-page constitution, if ratified, would give the EU a president, a foreign minister and a charter of fundamental rights - all deeply controversial in many EU nations.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, today confirmed that a UK referendum on the constitution was \"likely\" to be in spring 2006 - after both a general election and the UK's rotating presidency of the EU.</p> <p>The new \"rulebook\" for the EU replaces over 80,000 pages of legal documentation accumulated through a variety of treaties bonding the original European Economic Community of 1957, and was prompted by the accession this year of 10 new member states, mostly from the former Soviet block.</p> <p>Today's constitution was also signed by aspirant EU members Bulgaria and Turkey.</p> <p>At least eight member states, including the major players of Britain and France, will hold referendums affirming the constitution, with any \"no\" vote likely to at least deadlock progress.</p> <p>Although the constitution - drawn up over two years by the former French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard D'Estaing - will for the first time outline the process for an existing member to leave the EU, it has still provoked a strong Eurosceptic opposition in Britain and other countries, with the Conservatives calling it a \"ball and chain\" on British business.</p> <p>Britain successfully argued for a national veto on taxation, defence and social welfare, but the constitution spells out for the first time the division of powers between national government and EU \"competencies\".</p> <p>The new \"EU president\" will serve a two-and-a-half-year term, replacing the existing rotating presidency. The constitution would also introduce a post of EU foreign minister for the first time.</p> <p>The document states: \"The union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values are common to the member states in a society of pluralism, tolerance, justice, equality, solidarity and non-discrimination.\" </p> <p>\"The union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, and a single market where competition is free and undistorted.\" </p> <p>However, today's gathering is likely to be overshadowed by negotiations over the make-up of the European commission following commission president Jose Manuel Barroso's decision to postpone the EU parliament's ratification of the team.</p> <p>The delay came after it became clear that MEPs would reject all 24 commission nominees rather than accept the Italian Rocco Buttiglione, who has expressed controversial views on homosexuality and single mothers, as the justice commissioner.</p> <p>Today Mr Straw gave the first concrete timetable for a British referendum, saying it would have to wait until after the UK held the EU presidency in 2005.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the poll was \"likely to be in early 2006\". He added: \"It would be practically almost impossible to combine both running the presidency with holding a referendum. That is true for any government.\"</p> <p>However, Mr Straw seemed to draw back from the position taken earlier this year by Tony Blair, after the prime minister announced that the government's U-turn on holding a referendum, that such a referendum would take place no matter what other results came in from other countries.</p> <p>Mr Straw said: \"It [the British referendum] won't necessarily be the last one of all the member states.\"</p> <p>Asked if Britain might not hold a referendum if France had already rejected it, Mr Straw said: \"All sorts of things are possible.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw insisted the constitution was \"positive for the United Kingdom\". </p> <p>\"The irony of those who are saying 'vote no' is that you would end up falling back on the existing treaties which are, indeed, the subject of great criticism,\" he told Today.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, said: \"What we are seeing today is the opposite of democracy in action.</p> <p>\"The pomp and ceremony of seeing a treaty which the British people have indicated in opinion poll after opinion poll they do not want to see shows, in my view, a contempt for people.</p> <p>\"I would like to have seen this put to the people before there was an agreement on it by the leaders of the various European countries.\"</p> <p>On the European commissioners row, Mr Ancram said it was \"very dangerous\" to question people's religious views. </p> <p>\"If in the future a Muslim was put forward as a potential commissioner, I think we would be very wary of questioning too closely the religious beliefs of that particular person,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The gap between pay rates for men and women has narrowed to a record low but inequality between rich and poor has continued to widen, new figures showed yesterday. </p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said its survey of pay showed that gross weekly pay of all workers rose 4.7% in the year to April to \u00a3422. Within that, however, men's pay rose 4.3% to \u00a3462 a week while women's pay jumped 5.1% to \u00a3358 a week. </p> <p>Annual salaries, worked out on a slightly different basis, rose to a median of \u00a322,060 for full-time employees, with men's salaries up 3.8% to an average of \u00a324,326 while women's salaries rose 5.3% to \u00a318,531. That means women's pay rose to 85.6% of men's from 85.4% in 2003. Trade unions welcomed the narrowing of the gap but said it remained too big. </p> <p>\"The pay gap between men and women is too wide. Women still face discrimination in the workplace. Progress will only be made once employers are made to take responsibility for demonstrating that they do not discriminate,\" said Derek Simpson, head of engineering union Amicus. </p> <p>The ONS stressed, however, that its figures did not necessarily indicate different levels of pay for comparable jobs. Pay medians, it said, are affected by the different work patterns of men and women, such as the proportions in different occupations and their length of time in jobs. </p> <p>The figures are also affected by the fact that men work on average two hours a week more than women. </p> <p>Pay grew fastest in the north-east, at 7.1% and Northern Ireland, at 6.6%, while the east Midlands saw the lowest pay rises of 2.8%. Pay in London rose 4.6%, roughly in line with the national average. </p> <p>The ONS report also showed inequality continuing to widen in spite of the government's pledge to reduce it. The pay of the richest 10% of earners rose 4.3% in the year to April to \u00a3825 a week - nearly double the average of \u00a3422 a week while the pay of the poorest 10% rose only 4.1% to \u00a3230 a week,. </p> <p>The ONS said that the numbers of people earning less than the minimum wage of \u00a34.50 an hour came to 272,000 in the spring of this year, representing 1.1% of total of jobs. </p> <p>While a change in the calculation method made direct comparison difficult, it said 250,000 had been below minimum wage in 2003. The figures did not necessarily mean employers were flouting the law because apprentices were exempt from minimum wage rules, it added.</p>",
  "<p>Doctors have called for a further reduction in painkiller pack sizes after research was published showing previous reductions had slashed suicide rates by a fifth.</p> <p>The research, published in the British Medical Journal today, shows that suicidal deaths from paracetamol and aspirin fell by 22 percentage points in the year after pack sizes were reduced in September 1998. The reduction in suicides continued over the next two years.</p> <p>Non-fatal overdoses were also reduced: by 20% for paracetamol and 39% for aspirin in three years. As a result, liver transplants and admissions to hospitals for paracetamol poisoning saw a 30% fall in the four years after the laws came into force.</p> <p>But over the same period, overdoses from ibuprofen, which was not covered by the legislation, increased by 27% - although the number of deaths stayed the same.</p> <p>Sue Simkin, senior researcher at the Centre for Suicide Research at Oxford University, said: \"Legislation restricting pack sizes of analgesics in the United Kingdom has been beneficial. A further reduction in pack sizes could prevent more deaths.</p> <p>\"Other countries that have addressed this problem, such as France and Ireland, have had greater reductions in pack sizes than the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>She said the risk of liver poisoning from a paracetamol overdose substantially increases with the taking of more than 30 tablets for a person weighing 60kg.</p> <p>\"A further small reduction in pack sizes of paracetamol and salicylates would be unlikely to inconvenience users, and could have further beneficial effects in preventing deaths from self poisoning,\" she added.</p> <p>The research showed that between 1996 and 1998, there were 364 deaths as a result of paracetamol or aspirin overdose. This had fallen to 274 in the years 1999 to 2001.</p> <p>Deaths by aspirin saw a 46% fall, while paracetamol-induced deaths fell less sharply, by 29%. However, paracetamol overdoses are far more common.</p> <p>The legislation, which came into effect in 1998, reduced the previously unrestricted sale limit for pharmacies to 32 tablets, and for other retail outlets from 24 to 16 tablets. They must be sold in blister packs, not bottles.</p> <p>The aim was to reduce household stocks of analgesic drugs. Although there is nothing to stop someone buying two packs of painkillers, doctors say people usually attempt to commit suicide on impulse and use whatever they can find in the home.</p> <p>Suicide rates overall fell during the period (a 12% fall for men and a seven-point fall for women), but these reductions were outstripped by the reductions in fatal painkiller overdoses.</p> <p>Separate research published in today's Economist shows that suicides and unexplained deaths fell to a rate of 84 per million last year, a rate bettered in Europe only by Greece, Italy and Portugal.</p> <p>One of the most dramatic falls is among women aged 45 to 75: their suicide rate now stands at a third of the level in the sixties. Suicides among males aged 15 to 34 are down by 31 percentage points from their peak in 1998.</p>",
  "<p> For anyone interested in the potential crossover of virtual to real life through play in Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games, the second <a href=\"http://www.nyls.edu/pages/2396.asp\">State of Play</a> conference, held in partnership between New York Law School and Yale Law School, is being fastidiously covered by the extremely capable virtual world researchers at <a href=\"http://terranova.blogs.com/\">Terra Nova</a>.</p> <p>According to the conference blurb, some of the questions asked of the forward-thinkers in this field are: * What should be the relationship between real and virtual world economies? * Should legislatures protect virtual world property? * What are the possibilities for using virtual spaces to practice the activities of real world democracy? * Should virtual worlds be treated as separate jurisdictions with their own evolving norms and forms of dispute resolution? * What is the potential for using virtual worlds to promote democracy and self-governance?</p> <p>While that description may seem esoteric for the non-lawyer lay-person, in effect what this conference is asking is how close to reality are virtual worlds getting.</p> <p>Already there have been some pretty unbelievable things happening in the ether that shake the presumed foundations that reality stands on. For example, what is the real-world value of money if a fictional castle, made up of binary code, can be <a href=\"http://video-games.listings.ebay.com/Internet-Games_W0QQlotrZ1QQsacategoryZ1654QQsocmdZListingItemListQQsocolumnlayoutZ3QQsocustoverrideZ1\">purchased</a> for $700? How does the transaction of almost $6 million since the end of July 2004 over online auction sites compare with the annual earnings of an offline industry, like tennis shoes (it's comparable, according to economist <a href=\"http://mypage.iu.edu/~castro/\">Edward Castronova</a>). What if I told you that the average person playing a game like EverQuest <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/gaming.html\">made more per hour</a> than the average worker in Bulgaria?</p> <p>If that's not enough to shake the ground you're sitting on, what happens when a virtual mafia nicks all of a player's virtual gold, that he (or she) has slaved to get for up to 40 hours per week for three years of game playing time? In one <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994510\">case</a> in China, a long-time player received over $1,000 in damages from the games company.</p> <p>And finally, what about those entrepreneurs who claim to make millions of real dollars per year buying and selling in-game stuff over auction sites? If you don't believe it, a great real-world example can be read in Julian Dibbell's online <a href=\"http://www.juliandibbell.com/playmoney/index.html\">journal</a> of his year as a virtual goods salesman. While he didn't quite reach the dizzying multi-millionaire heights, it's been calculated that he <a href=\"http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/04/journalist_earn.html\">earned</a> more than the average high school teacher for his time.</p> <p>Some lawyers and policy makers believe that virtual worlds are potential environments in which to test out financial and political models before throwing them out into the real world. What does that say about the self-perpetuated, in-game governance that people take on themselves in virtual reality? What if someone wants to give up this world for that one?</p> <p>It's these topics that are under scrutiny at <a href=\"http://www.nyls.edu/pages/2396.asp\">State of Play II</a>.

  "Six men were today sentenced for up to six years in prison for rapes and sex attacks on the isolated Pacific island of Pitcairn. <p>The sentences of the convicted, who comprise half the adult male population, relate to attacks from up to 40 years ago, were announced by British authorities in New Zealand. </p> <p>They have been suspended pending appeals by the men's lawyers against Britain's jurisdiction over the island. In the event of the sentences being upheld, the men will serve their time in a prison block on the island that they helped to build. </p> <p>The mayor of Pitcairn Steve Christian, who claims to be a direct descendent of Fletcher Christian, the leader of the HMS Bounty mutineers who made Pitcairn their home, was convicted of five rapes of young women and sentenced to three years in prison. </p> <p>Sentences for the other five men ranged from community service to six years in prison.</p> <p>The men's trials revealed decades of sexual abuse of young women and girls as young as five. Prosecutors said sex attacks happened throughout the island including in church, in a garden, and on a boat. </p> <p>Victims testified they often did not report the abuse because of the community's culture of silence on the island.</p> <p>The defendants were convicted based on testimony from eight women who testified via a video link from a television studio in the northern New Zealand city of Auckland.</p> <p>Bryan Nicolson, spokesman for the British High Commission in Wellington, said today: \"In setting the sentences, the court indicated that it has taken into account the unique nature of Pitcairn and factors such as its isolation and the small number of able-bodied people among the small population of 47.\" </p> <p>Residents on the island fear that prison terms will prevent the men from crewing a longboat that is Pitcairn's lifeline - ferrying fuel and food from passing ships that cannot dock along the island's rocky coastline.</p> <p>Prison terms for the men likely would allow for them to be released temporarily to crew the longboats, said John Connell, an expert on the South Pacific from the University of Sydney. Otherwise, \"It would be punishment for the whole community,\" he said. </p> <p>Matthew Forbes, the island's deputy governor, said before the sentences were announced that Christian and his son Randy, chairman of a key island committee, should resign their posts or Britain's governor for the island would step in to ensure its \"best interests.\" He did not elaborate. </p> <p>The three-week trials were held under British law in makeshift courtrooms set up on the island's and presided over by three judges from New Zealand. </p> <p>Steve Christian's son, Randy, was sentenced to six years for four rapes and five indecent assaults. Len Brown, 78, was convicted of two rapes and sentenced to two years. His son, Dave, was convicted of nine indecent assaults and sentenced to community service. </p> <p>Dennis Christian, 49, the postmaster and another descendant of Fletcher Christian, was convicted of one indecent assault and two sexual assaults he pleaded guilty to at trial. He also was sentenced to community service. Terry Young was convicted of one rape and six indecent assaults. Judges imprisoned him for five years. </p> <p>Jay Warren, the island's magistrate, was found innocent of indecent assault. </p> <p>Pitcairn, in the Pacific Ocean midway between Peru and New Zealand, has long fascinated the world for being the refuge of men who mutinied aboard the Bounty and cast Captain William Bligh adrift with his supporters in 1789.

  "<p>The BBC is understood to be considering a plan to \"fatten up\" commercial arm BBC Worldwide - the UK's biggest exporter of TV programmes - for a possible sale in two years, in a move that could raise up to \u00a31bn.</p> <p>And the new chief operating officer of the BBC, John Smith, has ordered BBC Worldwide to double profits within two years, describing the past policy of focusing on revenues as obsolete.</p> <p>\"Now is the time for a profit focus. The profit is only \u00a337m, and that's low given the size of the business,\" he told the BBC in-house magazine, Ariel.</p> <p>Preparing BBC Worldwide for a sale is said to be one of the options being considered by in Mr Smith's review of the corporation's commercial activities.</p> <p>BBC Worldwide - the BBC subsidiary responsible for overseas programme sales, channels such as BBC America and UK Gold, book and magazine publishing and merchandising - has been valued at up to \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Mr Smith and the BBC director general, Mark Thompson, have played down speculation about an immediate sale of BBC Worldwide in recent weeks, despite earlier canvassing opinion from 25 rival media groups including Time Warner, Disney, Bertelsmann, Telewest, Discovery, ITV and Channel 4 about the future of the business.</p> <p>They have suggested a more likely course in the near future is to sell or find joint venture partners for BBC Worldwide assets deemed non-core, which could include parts of the book and magazine publishing division.</p> <p>Mr Smith also told senior BBC managers last week that he would look at possibly spinning off studios, the post-production operation BBC Resources, and the channel branding and playout unit BBC Broadcast, into joint ventures with private sector partners.</p> <p>But doubling BBC Worldwide's profits in the next two years would make the business a more attractive proposition for any buyer and smooth the way for a possible sale in the future.</p> <p>In the 12 months to March 31, BBC Worldwide's \u00a337m profit was squeezed out of turnover of \u00a3657m - a margin of just under 6% - according to figures quoted in Ariel.</p> <p>\"After a period of focus on sales growth and cash flow, now is the time for a profit focus. The profit is only \u00a337m and that's low given the size of the business. Profit declined by \u00a38m last year so now's the time to focus more on profit,\" Mr Smith said.</p> <p>\"The board of Worldwide is developing a plan which might see profits double in the next two years, which would be fantastic and send a strong message out there that we want to do better,\" he added.</p> <p>\"Lots of people in this market want to do a deal, everyone wants to buy Worldwide... but we are absolutely not putting it up for sale at the moment.\"</p> <p>BBC Worldwide's profits actually dropped in the past financial year, from \u00a344m to \u00a337m - a decline the BBC blames on the plunging dollar.</p> <p><strong>A change of strategy</strong><br></p> <p>A shift in focus to profit would mark a major strategic shift for BBC Worldwide.</p> <p>Traditionally BBC Worldwide has used the nebulous figure of \"cash flow\" - which includes the money Worldwide invests in BBC shows in return for overseas sales and merchandising rights - it delivers back to the public service broadcasting arm of the BBC as its key performance indicator.</p> <p>Preparing the ground for a possible BBC Worldwide sale in two years would give Mr Thompson extra room for manoeuvre, should charter renewal negotiations with the government result in a less generous than expected licence fee deal. </p> <p>The current 10-year BBC charter and five-year licence fee deal run to the end of 2006.</p> <p>Mr Thompson has warned BBC staff to tighten their belts and his review of costs and production and commissioning operations is expected to result in severe cutbacks and the loss of 6,000 jobs.</p> <p>But even with this new round of cost-cutting, Mr Thompson's sums may not add up, which is where a cash boost from selling commercial assets may come in.</p> <p>However, there are also potential pitfalls with a wholesale disposal of BBC Worldwide, not least the possible negative affect on staff morale at the commercial subsidiary if they know a sale is on the cards two years down the line.</p> <p>The BBC also needs to be vary careful about protecting its brand, for editorial and ethical reasons, as a trusted and respected public service broadcaster, which may limit the amount of control over rights exploitation it can hand over to private sector partners or buyers. </p> <p>And the value of the BBC brand makes up a large part of the worth attributed to BBC Worldwide as a saleable asset.</p> <p>\"I think the strategic attachment we have to [BBC Worldwide's] channels and sales [businesses] and anything that is BBC-branded or BBC-associated is strong and we mustn't let that go in any circumstances,\" Mr Smith told Ariel.</p> <p>Mr Smith is due to deliver the recommendations from his commercial review to Mr Thompson by the end of the month.</p> <p>They will then go before the BBC executive committee, which Mr Thompson chairs, and the board of governors in November.</p> <p>A BBC spokesman declined to comment.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "President Bush's election campaign received support from an unusual quarter last week when Hasan Rowhani, head of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council, said that four more years of George W would be good for Iran. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was asked about the Bush-Kerry contest at a meeting with journalists a couple of weeks ago (before he was taken ill) and replied: \"It makes no difference.\" <p>In London, the consensus among Arab ambassadors - though they don't say so publicly - is that keeping Bush in the White House would be preferable to starting afresh with Kerry.</p> <p>Such views are probably not what most people would expect to hear. Bush denounced Iran in his famous \"axis of evil\" speech and has been making hostile noises about it ever since. He has cold-shouldered Arafat and more or less washed his hands of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. More generally, as far as the Arab world is concerned, he has spared no effort to make himself the most unpopular American president ever.</p> <p>Disliking Bush is one thing, but working up enthusiasm for Kerry is another - and there's little sign of that in the Middle East. What interests Arabs most is America's attitude towards the Palestinian people. Although the US under a President Kerry might be expected to re-engage in the peace process, Kerry's emphatically-declared support for Israel does not inspire Arabs with hopes of an even-handed approach.</p> <p>Also pointing in Bush's favour is the popular Arab view that second-term American presidents are better placed to take a firm line with Israel than first-term presidents. The theory is that in their second term they no longer need to please the Israeli lobby in the US because they cannot seek re-election again. Although the examples of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr tend to disprove this theory, it's widely believed nevertheless. Bush gains, too, from the argument that says it's best to stay with the devil you know. Arab politicians and diplomats are fond of the status quo (look how long most of them have had their jobs) and, after four years adjusting to life under Bush, they would rather not embark on a new learning curve now with Kerry.</p> <p>In any case, the influential Egyptian daily, al-Ahram, sees no substantial difference between Bush and Kerry, and has declared its support for Ralph Nader (of Lebanese descent), describing him as the only candidate who \"responds to Arab-American interests and positions on Palestine, Iraq, civil liberties and world-wide respect for international law\".</p> <p>While agreeing that there may be little difference between Bush and Kerry on Israeli-Palestinian policy, Albert Aghazerian, a Palestinian-Armenian historian, detects a difference in their general attitude. </p> <p>\"It's a difference regarding people who have taken it upon themselves to act as if they are the liberators of the world,\" he said in an interview with the web magazine Bitter Lemons. \"For all his faults, I don't think Kerry will ignore the lessons that we have learnt throughout history. The Bush people think they have a self-righteous justification to go and change the course of things. This messianic spirit, I think, is less in Kerry than it is in Bush ... I believe that Bush has broken the basic rules of common sense ... it has to do with this messianic approach.\"</p> <p>Bush's messianic view, some argue, will bring more polarisation in the Middle East if he gets a second term, simultaneously benefiting the most impatient reformers and the Islamist militants: the reformers will be encouraged by continuing US pressure on Arab regimes, while al-Qaida and its likes will look to Bush for further help with their recruiting.</p> <p>There are various other sectional interests that could gain from keeping Bush in the White House. Bush's relaxed environmental policies benefit the oil-producing countries (as do the current high oil prices). Bush is less likely than Kerry to trouble Arab governments with complaints about human rights, so long as they continue to fight terrorism, and there are many Lebanese who welcome American efforts to stop Syria interfering in Lebanon's affairs.</p> <p>As far as Iraq and the presidential election is concerned, the most Machiavellian view was set out recently in the Jordan Times. On the assumption that the war is unwinnable, the writer suggested that electing Kerry now will allow the neoconservatives to blame him for American failure in Iraq and to insist that everything would have worked out fine if only Bush had been given a bit longer:</p> <p>\"Many on the American right still believe that the Vietnam war could have been won if only the spineless traitors of the left had not weakened American 'resolve' - and they say this even though Richard Nixon, who was elected on a promise to end the Vietnam war and presided over the whole latter phase of it, was a Republican. What could they do with a lost war on a Democratic president's watch?\"</p> <p>Far better, then, to keep Bush in power and make him reap the whirlwind. The Iraq quagmire may also explain why Hasan Rowhani and some other Iranian officials (though not, by any means, all of them) would like Bush to have a second term. So long as the US is bogged down in Iraq, it cannot seriously contemplate toppling the regime in Iran - or, for that matter, in Syria. Prospects for the US remaining bogged down look rather better under Bush than Kerry.</p> <p>Some in the Iranian government also think Bush has begun to realise that his hostile policies towards Iran are unlikely to succeed and is therefore likely to adopt a more realistic approach if elected for a second term. If the dominant view of the Bush-Kerry contest in the Middle East is one of overwhelming cynicism, the picture among Arab-Americans - who do, after all, have a say in the outcome - is rather different.</p> <p>Despite Bush's effort to woo them with a with a message of greetings for Ramadan (\"Americans who practise the Islamic faith enrich our society ... Laura joins me in sending our best wishes\"), they overwhelmingly support Kerry.</p> <p>A recent poll of Arab-American voters in four of the states where they are most numerous - Michigan, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - showed 54% backing Kerry and only 28% backing Bush, with the rest undecided or supporting Nader.</p> <p>Arab Americans, though, have different priorities from Arabs in the Middle East. For them, the most important factor in deciding who to vote for is the American economy, followed by terrorism/national security, according to the poll. Iraq came fourth in their list of important issues, and Israeli-Palestinian issues only eighth.</p> <p>The poll was conducted by Zogby International, a Washington-based firm whose boss, John Zogby, is from a prominent Arab-American family. Last week John Zogby's brother, James, who is president of the Arab American Institute, wrote an article for al-Ahram Weekly explaining why he would be voting for Kerry.</p> <p>\"The last four years have had a devastating effect on our nation,\" he wrote. \"They have tested our national unity and our sense of mission. The Bush administration has pursued domestic and foreign policies that have been both neglectful and reckless. Because of reckless tax cuts a record surplus was turned into record deficits.\"</p> <p>Turning to the benefits of electing Kerry and his running-mate John Edwards, he continued: \"Whatever differences I may have with them, I know that they will pursue diplomacy over unilateral military pre-emption. They can be better trusted to find a way out of Iraq than the arrogant crew that got us into that mess in the first place.</p> <p>\"They will protect our civil liberties ... and they will make the pursuit of an Israeli-Palestinian peace a priority rather than a neglected afterthought.\"</p> <p>Optimistic words. But we shall have to wait a few more days to see if Kerry gets a chance to prove them wrong or right.</p>",
  "<p>I entered the Frankfurt book fair with a map of Iraq as a brooch on my blouse. The spotlights dangling from the publishers' aisles were burning into contract paper, glossy posters and visitors' faces. The scent of smoky ink brought back memories of my late Scottish mother, a librarian in Edinburgh in the 1950s. She invited me to become a writer, and the Arab League invited the writer to Frankfurt. </p> <p>She took care of hundreds of books: dusted, archived, and cherished them, but she would never keep them at home. In Baghdad, she would proudly arrange her collection of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but she would never display novels on her shelves. Her philosophy was: \"Novels should be circulated among readers. We have to let go of them, to allow the stories to spread.\" Holding that thought, I searched for fellow novelists. </p> <p>The opening ceremony highlighted the importance of building a bridge between east and west. The speakers took turns: the German chancellor, the lady mayor of Frankfurt, the secretary general of the Arab League, the chief of the union of German publishers, and a representative of Naquib Mahfouz, the Nobel prize winner. </p> <p>First Lady Mubarak did not give a speech. Instead, she had a poster in the Egyptian pavilion with her photo stating: \"Reading is for all\". It was claimed that 1,000 writers, novelists and thinktanks would be there, 300 of them from the Arab world. </p> <p>The event was referred to as a festival of curiosity; meeting the unknown; the alien; the foreign; the exotic; poverty and crisis; it ended with the key words, the third world. Opinions varied: \"Islam is generalised\"; \"it is not about a clash of cultures, it is about fighting terrorism\"; \"the question is not about who was right, we are now responsible for stability and democracy\"; \"all that happens in the world is due to the written word\". The brief mention of the issue of Palestine sounded like history, and the issue of Iraq sounded like the future. </p> <p>With fresh sunflowers in the background, the speakers engaged in botanical terminology. \"A book is like a garden you carry in your pocket\"; \"we want to smell the roses of your garden\"; \"flowers of light\"; and \"fruits of culture\". Entwined in the Laura Ashley exchange, the Arabs insisted they were the source of knowledge since the dawn of civilisation, a fact the Germans diplomatically conceded. </p> <p>I sensed a subtext: \"Hey, west, let's settle the account. You acquired our sciences: now you have the technology. We write about our miseries: now you can help us publish them - and maybe make some money.\" </p> <p>I learned to sense subtexts when I was little. I was my mother's translator. It was my duty to explain to her what was meant in the language of my father's people. Thus I learned the art of simplification. It is interesting what one picks up amidst the differences in cultures. From my parents' disputes I learned the dos and don'ts. </p> <p>In this cultural gathering, I tried to remember not to use the word orientalist in the presence of researchers into Arabic culture; nor to use the term Arabist in the presence of Palestinians. Meanwhile, Iraqis thrived on the term occupation, and a bunch of Israelis who were not happy demonstrated outside the fair against the guest of \"honour\". </p> <p>I liked the expression of a German official who labelled the event \"the city of intellectual wrestling\". I particularly salute its unknown soldiers, the translators. I followed their miraculous input in a very short time, nearly breaking down with exhaustion as they translated the Arab works into German, with great care. They are the true bridge builders. </p> <p>Throughout the symposia I felt too much emphasis was put on questions like: Who are we? Who are they? Who does the novel belong to? What do you consider your home? And the issue of double identities. The theme repeated itself to the extent that when someone asked me, \"So where do you live?\", I decided to adopt my global attitude: \"In my head, and when I want to talk, I open my mouth to let myself out.\" </p> <p>During an overwhelming four days of self-promotion, I was surprised by my Iraqi compatriot's choice of reading. It was a short story about a crime of honour in which the male catches his female partner messing around with another man. A shotgun shows up in the scene, bang, and the lady is dripping with blood in bed! </p> <p>Then I tried to detach myself by attending Arabic musical performances. Sheherazade was a good idea, but Rimsky-Korsakov - not original Arabic compositions - was thrown at the western public, along with an exaggerated sketch of the evil dancer chopping off the heads of 10 female dolls with an Arabian dagger! </p> <p>Low on energy, I bumped into Khalil Shawki, a veteran Iraqi actor in his late 80s. I said: \"I'm not sure that my writing will contribute to changing the world, as expected by all these speeches.\" He replied: \"It's up to you how you use your pen. The human being is like steam: he can move a train or limit himself to a boiling kettle.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Betool Khedairi was born to an Iraqi father and a Scottish mother; she is the author of two novels, A Sky So Close and Ghayeb (The Absent One) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.betoolkhedairi.com\">www.betoolkhedairi.com</a></p>",

  "<b>Murder law</b> <br> The home secretary, David Blunkett, apologised for the botched announcement of a review of the law on murder. He said it had been his intention to make it in Wednesday's debate on the domestic violence, crime and victims bill. But a press release had been issued by his department \"prematurely\" and the stage in which he would have spoken on the legislation was never reached. <p>Mr Blunkett said he had taken steps to avoid such an incident happening again. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said he should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to the house. But he welcomed the review and the home secretary's \"gracious apology\". </p> <p><b>Iraq cost</b><br> Military action in Iraq has cost the British taxpayer \u00a32.159bn, it emerged in the latest government figures. Armed forces minister Adam Ingram said additional defence costs of \u00a3848m were incurred in 2002-3 and \u00a31.311 billion in 2003-4. Estimates for 2004-5 were not yet available. </p> <p><b>School run</b><br> Ten of thousands of poor families and parents of special needs pupils will have to pay for school transport under plans to tackle the school run, shadow education secretary Tim Collins warned. He said plans to hand control of school transport to councils could land them with bills of up to \u00a3500-a-year for each child. </p> <p>MPs were debating the school transport bill, which the government hopes will cut traffic and help curb rising obesity levels of youngsters. Councils in a pilot scheme will be given \u00a3200,000 each to \"kickstart\" trials of new ideas for getting children to school. Authorities taking part would be able to charge fares to help pay for new schemes. </p> <p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, accused the Tories and Liberal Democrats of \"sheer naked opportunism\" and said councils controlled by all parties were keen to take part. </p> <p><b>School dinners</b><br> The standard of food is too low in many schools, the government conceded. Charles Hendry, for the Tories, said a Soil Association report highlighted a \"shocking\" loss of mineral content in school meals. Junior education minister Ivan Lewis said some examples given in the report did not fulfil basic nutritional standards. These were being revised. </p> <p>\"We do accept that there are many secondary schools where standards aren't as high as they should be,\" he said. </p> <p><b>Smacking</b><br> Labour MPs stepped up demands for a free vote on moves to ban smacking and afford children equal protection from assault as adults. The leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, said an outright ban was against government policy but told MPs they could vote on proposals to allow \"mild smacking\". </p> <p><b>Hunting</b><br> Elements of the pro-hunting lobby are undermining its position by resorting to violence and thuggery, Mr Hain warned. It was unacceptable that the security of MPs and ministers was increasingly under threat, he protested. Mr Hain was pelted with eggs by pro-hunt demonstrators as he addressed a meeting at Oxford on Wednesday. </p> <p><b>Pollution</b><br> The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, was prevented by cabinet colleagues from making an oral statement to MPs on scaling down pollution targets, Paul Tyler, for the Liberal Democrats, protested. He also alleged she had been overruled on the issue by Mr Blair and the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt. Mr Hain did not comment on claims about a cabinet split, instead emphasising the government's commitment to reducing emissions. </p> <p><b>Gypsy camps</b><br> The legal process to reclaim land over-run by \"gypsy camps\" takes too long, Tory Adrian Flook said. He told MPs a five-acre field at Curry, Somerset had been \"turned into an illegal gypsy camp complete with roads, fencing and septic tanks\" over a 48-hour period last weekend. Mr Hain said he acknowledged the problem, adding: \"I know these problems bedevil constituencies across the country and your point has been put very effectively.\" </p> <p><b>SNP</b><br> The Scottish National party should make a public apology for branding the Union Flag a \"butcher's apron\", the government was told. Nationalist Bruce McPhee made the comment last week and said he just wanted the Saltire flag to hang outside the Scottish parliament building in Edinburgh. Labour's Jim Sheridan said the statement was \"outrageous\" and demanded an apology. Mr Hain said an apology should be made for the \"disgraceful attack on our armed forces\". </p> <p><b>Regional assembly ballot</b><br> The referendum on a north-east regional assembly, to be declared next Thursday, is degenerating into chaos, shadow Commons leader Oliver Heald claimed. He said: \"Ballot returns are tiny and there are reports that 17-year-olds have received ballot packs in Northumberland. </p> <p>Voters in Darlington are reporting that their ballot packs contained a charity envelope rather than a voting paper.\" Mr Hain hit back: \"The returns are now accelerating and I hope that the people of the north-east of England will vote 'Yes'. </p> <p><b>Robert Kilroy-Silk</b><br> Labour's John Cryer said Robert Kilroy-Silk had used taxpayers' money to stand successfully for election but had now decided to \"have a little tantrum\" and resign the UKIP whip. He told Mr Hain: \"Shouldn't we consider that he pays taxpayers' money back and if he fails or refuses to do it we'll seize his villa in Spain.\" A smiling Mr Hain said he was \"very attracted\" by the proposition. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>Parliament is not sitting. </p> <p> <b>In parliament on Monday</b><br>There are Commons questions on culture, media and sport, the church commissioners, the public accounts commission and the Speaker's committee on the Electoral Commission. The gambling bill is set to gain its second reading. The Lords debates the pensions bill's report stage and Sudan and Darfur.</p>",
  "David Blunkett, the home secretary, was accused of abusing parliament yesterday after being forced to apologise to the House of Commons for the botched announcement of a review of the law of murder. <p>He was called to the Commons after news of the review, the first for more than 50 years, was announced by the Home Office. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett had been due to make the announcement in yesterday's debate on the domestic violence, crime and victims bill but Conservative filibustering meant his speech never took place. </p> <p>Yesterday, the Tories attacked Mr Blunkett for apparently leaking news to the media, even though he apologised to the Speaker. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said it was the second time this week he had been \"dragged to the house to explain himself\" and this was unprecedented. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett, said that if his department had been intent on news management it would not have issued the press release until the start of the third reading debate.</p>",
  "<p>Our law of libel is outmoded, unjust, haphazard, illogical and unnecessary. It is a remnant from other eras, other societies, other mores. It needs to be put to rest. </p> <p>Over the years, the law of defamation has developed in a way which almost forgets its primary purpose - restoring lost reputation - and concentrates instead on financial compensation. It should be the opposite. Correcting the lie should be more important than compensating for it. </p> <p>It is not those who have suffered most that the law has helped most. Our law and practice over decades has been almost entirely used to further the cause of the already well-off, whereas the real losers, people whose lives may genuinely have been ruined, have received little succour. Until recently, the main culprit was the lack of legal aid for defamation. We now have \"no win, no fee\", which has enabled a few more victims to enter the libel arena. But allowing more people access to a discredited system is not the answer. The system itself needs to be replaced. </p> <p>The first absurdity of the law lies in the definition of defamation, which does not require evidence that the claimant has in fact lost his or her reputation. When you sue someone who has injured you physically, you first have to prove that you were injured. You can't say \"what the defendant did could have caused my leg to break, even though, as a matter of fact, the leg's absolutely fine\". That would be absurd. But in libel, it's not necessary to have a witness say: \"I used to think that he was a terrific chap, but now that I've read the Daily Sleaze, I think he's awful.\" Only in the law of defamation can a defendant become legally liable for doing something that has not harmed the person claiming compensation. </p> <p> I t is also not a requirement to prove financial loss. If you're injured and want compensation for loss of income, you have to show proof of what you've lost. Not so with libel. Even if the claimant hasn't suffered financially, he or she can still receive substantial compensation. </p> <p>It's true that awards by juries today are far lower than they were a decade ago. The days of compensation frequently above \u00a3200,000 are gone. The appeal court now has the power to reduce a jury's award, and judges are now allowed to guide the jury as to the maximum they should give. But curing the absurdity of madly high compensation poses a new question. What is the role of the jury now? If they accept the trial judge's suggested guidance on the amount, the decision is really the judge's and not the jury's. If they ignore the judge, their award will almost certainly be lowered on appeal. </p> <p>Which is worse? To allow the jury their freedom, resulting in lunatic awards? Or to restrict their scope, in which case their awards are meaningless, because they're a judge's view? </p> <p>Here's the answer. Get rid of the libel jury. True, they also decide whether or not a claimant has been defamed, and on any defences of truth or fair comment raised by the defendant newspaper. But those tasks can better be done by the new body I'll be proposing. </p> <p>The vast majority of libel claims should not be primarily about compensation, but about correcting a mistake or misapprehension. Most people who make a claim would be content at getting some form of apology, retraction or correction. What is needed is a quick and cheap mechanism by which the alleged victim can get satisfaction. </p> <p>I would create a Defamation Authority, which could issue a binding order requiring the publication to publish the correction or clarification - and to lay down where in the paper it should be. The authority - whose procedures would be designed to be speedy and informal - would also have the power to award sums of, say, up to \u00a310,000 compensation for hurt feelings and any genuine loss of reputation, and, in addition, for proven - I stress proven - financial loss. </p> <p>There remains one problem. What can be done about newspapers that take a calculated risk to defame, knowing that increased sales will make up for any damages they may have to pay out? </p> <p>When compensation awards were high and juries' verdicts couldn't be challenged, there was at least some deterrent on the media to be careful. Lower compensation inevitably means more irresponsible journalism. Libel is becoming cheap to commit. The answer is to separate compensation for the libel victim from punishing the newspaper for its unacceptable conduct. </p> <p>If you're injured in a crash caused by a drunken driver, you do not get higher compensation than if the driver was sober. It's left to the criminal law to punish the drunk. So it should be with defamation. Let the victim of the libel be awarded what compensation he or she deserves; and let the misbehaving media be brought to a different kind of justice and be fined the kind of sums that will make the perpetrators of the libel wince with pain. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Marcel Berlins is visiting professor of law at Queen Mary's, University of London; this article is an edited extract from his inaugural lecture </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mberlins@aol.com\">mberlins@aol.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Yesterday's ruling will spark alarm among lenders, whose beguiling offers of \"consolidation\" and \"home improvement\" loans have been at the heart of Britain's spiralling \u00a31 trillion of debt. </p> <p>The case hinged on whether the credit agreement the couple signed was \"extortionate\". </p> <p>The rate of interest charged, at 34.9%, was not in itself remarkably high; doorstep lenders on average charge annual percentage rates (APRs) of 170% and rates touching 1,000% are not unknown. </p> <p>What caused the loan to spiral was simple maths: miss just one payment and the interest-on-interest begins to compound up. The couple missed three years of payments at an APR that meant their outstanding borrowings doubled every two years. </p> <p>Credit law expert Bob Imrie, a former trading standards chief, said: \"If you miss just one payment, the mathematics mean you get further and further behind. </p> <p>\"Penalties and other charges just make it worse. You can end up with infinity if you just carry on with the contracted payments. And lenders have no legal duty to send out annual statements on this form of loan.\" </p> <p>The ruling will put pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry, currently updating the 1974 Consumer Credit Act, to insert new regulations insisting that lenders send annual statements to stop small arrears spiralling into massive debts. </p> <p>It will also renew pressure on ministers to set a maximum interest rate that lenders can charge. Such a move was ruled out in August, but at the time ministers left the door open for a possible rethink. </p> <p>The DTI has been exploring bringing back a legal limit on interest rates as a way of combating loan sharks and unfair credit deals, but is concerned it could cause more problems than it would solve. </p> <p>Thirty years ago no lender could charge a rate of more than 48%, but this upper limit was scrapped with the introduction of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the National Consumer Council said yesterday's ruling was a welcome surprise. </p> <p>\"This outcome is very unusual. Few people, over the last few years, have been able to show that the terms of their loan were extortionate. </p> <p>\"There have been plenty of cases brought by people caught in similar circumstances that have failed, and they have been forced to pay up.\"</p>",
  "<p>The red button has recently been used in its 500th television campaign. </p> <p>Those with interactive TV are well aware of its existence, uses and powers but viewers still receiving analogue transmission will probably not know how the remote control button allows access to a world of interactivity, competitions, acquisitions, extra information and programming. </p> <p>The 500th campaign was assigned to a recruitment drive for the Territorial Army. Those watching the advertisements were encouraged to push the red button and experience a small movie on the reality of life in the army with the option of ordering a free Territorial Army DVD and information pack. </p> <p>The technology has been touted as a new creative channel, or a way for brands to make ads work harder. </p> <p>Alchemetrics is measuring the effectiveness of campaigns, their penetration into markets and impact on purchasing behaviour for specialist independent interactive firm Zip Television. </p> <p>Typically, measurement of ad success has been through indirect research or sample-sized ratings figures. </p> <p>Integrated campaigns are common now and the same message is used over and over, with brand awareness being difficult to attribute to a single output. Measurement by ratings always has ignored the possibility of a TV playing to an empty room. </p> <p>Interactive TV offers the first glimpse of directly measurable above-the-line advertising, where physical action determines the power of the creative. Like the thumbs in the Colosseum, viewers will effectively vote to be drawn in or not. This is significant for those who make the ads. </p> <p>It may be even more significant for those who broadcast them and charge for the space. Broadcasters will quickly be in a position where it is increasingly clear which brands work in which slots and on which channels. Media buyers will be in the same position, and are likely to improve their targeting of ad time. </p> <p>The effects of such developments remain uncertain at this stage; this could lead to overall revenues falling or advertisers moving slices of marketing spend to other channels. I think we will witness improved targeting, which can only be good for consumer and marketer. </p> <p>This will also create huge advances in marketers' knowledge of exactly who is watching and interacting through use of the red button. When coupled with transactional information it should be possible to infer a direct link between ad campaigns and purchase patterns, something of a holy grail for fast-moving consumer goods marketing. It also begins to open up possibilities for the use of TV as a direct marketing tool. </p> <p>The main benefit I see is for fast-moving consumer goods brands; producers of such brands have always struggled to collect data on customers and prospects because of the low value items they sell and therefore the capacity to incentivise customers for this information. </p> <p>ITV challenges this model as it is far easier for a customer to respond via ITV, even if it is for soap powder, than it is for them to respond via other channels. </p> <p>The final big leap for interactive TV is in the relationship between programmers and advertisers. </p> <p>Sponsorship and even programme production is already undertaken by many big ad spenders, who value their brands being near shows that deliver their target audience. Take Coronation Street and Cadbury's, or Baileys and Sex and the City. </p> <p>It is not too much of a mindset change for ads to become the programme. The Wilkinson/Beckham Adidas campaign was essentially an entertainment programme with stripes. </p> <p>Would children watch adidastv to see their heroes kicking each other's balls? I would think so. </p> <p>And if this is the case, expect to see a new breed of channels, either in the interactive space or not, which are 24-hour brand vehicles - the new consumer TV. </p> <p>The red button has notched up millions of clicks since its inception. But it may only be beginning to reveal its true scope to a watching nation. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chris Duncan is managing director of Alchemetrics, a marketing technology solutions company</p>",
  "<p>There's one certainty about your student life that will always be there, but that you'll never quite get used to: once you've spent what will seem like eons getting hold of your cash, it will simply pour through your fingers like sand - and pretty fine sand at that. So having expended so much effort in getting hold of what precious money you can in the form of student loans, grants, bursaries and the meager pennies from bar jobs or flipping burgers, you'll find you've now got to redouble that effort, just to keep it. The moment you think you're doing OK is, as likely as not, the moment you get the letter from the bank telling you you're not.</p> <p>It sounds dull, and in many ways, it is dull, but if you want to avoid serious problems, you've simply got to learn to keep track of your outgoings and try to make your income and spending balance as much as is possible. Not very rock 'n' roll, but it is your best way of steering clear of penury.</p> <p>The first step is to know what's going on with your finances. It might sound patronising even, but if you have no idea what is going into and out of your account, you are much more likely to overspend and get into trouble by, for example, running out of money for rent before the end of term. Not only that, but being financially astute is fast becoming a necessary life skill - as financial products such as pensions and mortgages multiply and change almost weekly - so you may as well get some practice in while you're a student.</p> <p>The first thing to do is add up the money you have from loans, jobs, parents and so on. Divide this by the number of weeks you will be at university. Most universities teach for 30 weeks a year, but in practice you will probably arrive a week early and/or leave a week late, or stay in your student accommodation over a holiday, so it's best to play safe and divide your income by at least 35 weeks. </p> <p>Then, make a list of all your unavoidable costs. This will include any contribution you have to make towards fees, rent, bills, food, clothes, transport and entertainment. Always calculate for the worst case scenario - spending more than you would hope - since most of those in serious debt are hopelessly optimistic. Ideally, you'll surprise yourself with your financial discipline. Make a weekly budget. It may sound boring, but just about every student advice centre says this is a crucial step, so who am I to differ? You may have more thrilling ways of spending an hour or so each week than scribbling down details of your expenditure in a petty cash book (or on a computer spreadsheet), but it will be worth it. And no one else need know. You will be able to see what unnecessary purchases you make and cut them out, and set aside any spare cash to do the things you really want to do (such as travel during the holidays); second, it will prove very handy if you have to go cap in hand to the bank manager seeking an extended overdraft.</p> <p>Accommodation will be your biggest single expense and your university should be able to give you an idea of what average accommodation - both in student and private, rented flats - will cost. Rents can start as low as \u00a350 a week in student halls outside the capital and rise to about \u00a3110 a week for a room in a shared, privately rented flat in London. In halls, bills are usually included. In private accommodation, they are extra and average around \u00a3400 a year. If you have the option of living at home, do consider it. </p> <p>It may not be what you had in mind when you imagined university, but a few more years at mum and dad's could save you thousands of pounds. You don't have to feel like a mummy's boy or girl just for making a financially astute choice - studying from home is an attractive option for an increasing number of students. It obviously cuts down on food and rent (assuming your family don't soak you for every penny they can), then there's the tantalising possibility of a laundry and ironing service and the feeling of generally being looked after - a place where the food includes fresh vegetables. Studying at a university near home is the norm in continental Europe and a long tradition in big (ie expensive) cities in the UK, such as London or Glasgow.</p> <p>If you do go away to university, and if your university offers hall places to second and third-year students as well, consider staying on - it will save you a lot of money. Admittedly, it doesn't happen very often that you have the choice, but it's worth bearing in mind.</p> <p>Whatever your accommodation expenses, pay them as early as you can, before you have the chance to spend that part of your money. The last thing you need is to stare, horrified, at a final demand for rent in one hand and an empty bank statement in the other.</p> <p>Food is another unavoidable expense. You'll doubtless have heard the apocryphal tale of the student who lived off porridge/noodles/biscuits for a year to save money and ended up with scurvy, so you'll doubtless want to eat healthily and should put aside at least \u00a31,000 for the year. Shop and cook with housemates. Buy in bulk, buy basic brands (they taste almost the same), make your own meals from the basic ingredients (rather than eating pre-prepared dishes) and take a shopping list to the supermarket rather than making impulse purchases.</p> <p>The cost of course materials will vary massively depending on what course you are studying. Science, medical and law degrees usually require expensive textbooks. Art and design students need specialist equipment that can cost several hundred pounds. Put aside at least a few hundred pounds for materials, remembering that you will need to do photocopying and continue to buy stationery throughout the year. If you can, and wherever you can, buy second-hand books or try to find the same information on the internet. Assuming your university or college gives you free access, it can be a much cheaper way of gaining the information you need.</p> <p>How much you spend on clothing will depend on how fashion conscious you are. It's cheaper to aim for geek chic and buy from charity shops, and you'll end up with a much more individual look. If you're desperate for new clothes rather than \"pre-loved\" then get your family and friends to buy you tokens for the chain shops you love for Christmas and birthdays.</p> <p>Spending on entertainment can vary wildly. Just as some students buy the latest designer gear and go to expensive, exclusive clubs every weekend, others make do with wearing jeans and T-shirts and drinking at the student union bar.</p> <p>Whichever you are, try to be realistic about what you will spend on entertainment. By the time you get to calculate your entertainment budget, you will probably find you have already run out of money and may be tempted to imagine yourself scrimping on the fun and games to stay out of debt. This won't happen. You will go out and you need to go out to maintain and create friendships and to remind yourself that one of the reasons you are there in the first place is to enjoy yourself. So don't be a killjoy, just put aside some money for fun - at least \u00a335 a week would be a realistic figure.</p> <p>The only good news on the budget front is that, as a student, you will be entitled to discounts at various places. Cinemas, some pub and club chains, clothing shops and bookshops offer discounts of up to 30% to students. Train and air travel is also cheaper.</p> <p>While all this may sound a bit nerdy, remember that being cavalier about your money is fun only for so long. Once you're heavily in debt (and you all will be to some degree) it starts to become restrictive - you can afford less, the banks will loan you less and the credit card people will start to laugh in your face. Those holidays will recede over the horizon and when you start to look for a job, the wage will become the deciding issue, not whether you'll actually enjoy it.</p> <p>So be a bit nerdy. Plan your spending and keep a record of what you're spending. No one else need know and you can emerge from all this smiling.</p>",
  "With four days to go to an election that every poll suggests is too close to call, American political scientists fear a new quirk that could threaten the country's embattled electoral system: a tie. <p>An exact draw is possible because the president is not chosen by popular vote, but by 538 electors in the electoral college. The electors are chosen by each state and there are many ways George Bush and John Kerry could end up with 269 electors each. In fact, according to a new computer analysis quoted in the Washington Post, there are 33 different permutations that could make that happen. </p> <p>Thomas Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, said an electoral college tie remained \"the rarest of outcomes\". </p> <p>But this year, the country is braced for the unusual, and if the election is a draw, Mr Schaller warned: \"Look for stark raving mad chaos for about a month.\" </p> <p>Richie Robb, a mild-mannered Republican mayor of a West Virginia town, could find himself at the centre of the furore. </p> <p>His party has nominated him as one of West Virginia's five electors if the president wins the state. But he says he is not sure he wants to vote for Mr Bush. </p> <p>He has already come under intense Republican pressure to toe the line but he told the Guardian yesterday he was holding firm to his indecision. </p> <p>\"I'm still undecided. I have some problems about voting for President Bush. Starting a war in Iraq was the wrong step in the fight against terrorism. And then tax cuts that help the rich and not the moderate earner ... \" But Mr Robb added that he was also unimpressed by Senator Kerry. </p> <p>If Mr Robb refuses to cast a vote for either candidate, Senator Kerry could win the electoral college by 269 votes to 268, but not before Mr Robb was subjected to the most intense pressure from the White House. He said he was aware of the prospect. \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,\" he declared. </p> <p>Alternatively, a potential tie could be broken in Maine, one of only two states that splits its four electoral votes according to the election result there, rather than on a winner-takes-all basis. The other state that does that is Nebraska, which is solidly Republican. </p> <p>Assuming that, after all the legal wrangling, the electoral college is still tied, the constitution stipulates that the president should be chosen by the House of Representatives, and the vice-president by the Senate. </p> <p>Mr Bush should win a House vote, as there are far more Republican-dominated state delegations than Democratic ones. But if John Kerry wins the popular vote, as Al Gore did in 2000, a decision by the House of Representatives to award the election to Mr Bush would trigger fierce protests. \"It will be a constitutional crisis,\" Mr Schaller said. </p> <p>The first impressions of what that crisis may look like are already apparent in Florida, where election officials declared themselves baffled yesterday by the whereabouts of tens of thousands of absentee ballot papers. </p> <p>Broward county, one of the focal points of the recount drama in 2000, said it would resend at least 20,000 ballots by overnight mail, and by courier if necessary, after complaints suggesting that up to 58,000 forms might never have arrived after being posted on October 7 and 8. The county's deputy elections supervisor, Gisela Salas, said the problem had been \"beyond our control\", but the US Postal Service also denied responsibility. </p> <p>\"Let's just hope it's not a close election,\" said Walter Berns, an expert on the electoral college at the American Enterprise Institute. \"If we have a replay of Florida 2000, with all these lawyers all over the place, it will undermine the legitimacy of the constitution.\"</p>",
  "Yasser Arafat is to fly to Paris today for emergency medical treatment, leaving for the first time in more than two years the battered Ramallah compound in which Israel has confined him. <p>Doctors from four Arab countries were yesterday unable to pinpoint what had caused the serious deterioration in the health of the 75-year-old Palestinian leader, amid growing speculation he is suffering from leukaemia. </p> <p>Ariel Sharon's government lifted its ban on Mr Arafat leaving the occupied territories, and for the first time guaranteed that he would be allowed to return to the West Bank, in a move to ensure that Israel is not accused of contributing to his death. </p> <p>A succession of doctors examined Mr Arafat at his compound yesterday and recommended that he immediately travel abroad for treatment after losing consciousness and repeated vomiting on Wednesday. </p> <p>An aide to Mr Arafat, Munnib al-Masri, said that medical tests over recent months have not revealed what is afflicting the Palestinian leader. He said the ailment was almost certainly a blood condition, probably life threatening, but doctors have been unable to discover which one. </p> <p>Doctors have told Mr Arafat's aides that his immune system is collapsing. Israeli officials have told Israeli newspapers that the Palestinian leader is suffering from a type of \"blood cancer\". </p> <p>In an attempt to allay fears that he is on his deathbed, the Palestinian leadership released a photograph yesterday of Mr Arafat wearing blue pyjamas, a black woollen hat and smiling while surrounded by ministers and aides. But officials said the Palestinian leader was gravely ill, had been confined to a wheelchair and was still vomiting periodically. One official said Mr Arafat appeared dazed and did not recognise those around him. Palestinian officials and the visiting doctors, from Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, have previously said Mr Arafat was suffering from flu and gallstones. They have denied he has cancer. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's compound has two rooms fitted with medical equipment, including an X-ray scanner, ultrasound machines and emergency resuscitation gear. Tests on him have been carried out here. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's wife, Suha, arrived in the West Bank from Paris yesterday for the first time since the start of the intifada four years ago. She is expected to accompany her husband on the flight today. </p> <p>The French government dispatched an air ambulance to Jordan to carry Mr Arafat to Paris. He was expected to be flown by helicopter to Amman this morning. </p> <p>Last night, bulldozers began removing defences inside Mr Arafat's compound designed to prevent Israeli military helicopters landing in order that he can be airlifted to Jordan. </p> <p>The Palestinian leadership has prepared for Mr Arafat's incapacitation or death with the appointment of a three-man committee to run affairs. They are the prime minister Ahmed Qureia, the former premier, Mahmoud Abbas, who is Mr Arafat's deputy in the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and a senior Fatah official, Salim Zanoun. </p> <p>Under the Palestinian basic law, if Mr Arafat dies, the speaker of parliament, Rawhi Fattouh, would replace him as president of the Palestinian Authority for 60 days while elections are held. </p> <p>Two Palestinian leadership groups, the central committee of the ruling Fatah movement and the PLO executive committee, were expected to meet at Mr Arafat's headquarters last night to discuss how to handle the crisis. </p> <p>But there were hints at the potential for turmoil after Mr Arafat is gone, when Qadura Feres, a Palestinian MP and senior member of Fatah, yesterday suggested that elections would not be possible within that time frame because of the continued Israeli stranglehold on the occupied territories. </p> <p>\"We have this terrible situation and I don't think we will be able to have elections in 60 days so we have to change the basic law and appoint a president,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Sharon then held a security meeting. Israel has prepared contingency plans, including how to deal with potential riots and how to prevent attempts by the Palestinians to bury Mr Arafat in Jerusalem. </p> <p>Mr Arafat has spent all of the past two-and-a-half years confined to his compound, which has been substantially rebuilt since the 2002 Israeli raid. He has slept in a small room with one window and a single bed.</p>",
  "It was the day that changed Russia's history, a date that has given its name to streets, squares, factories, metro stations, hotels and entire regions. <p>But now Moscow is about to do away with the public holiday commemorating the 1917 Bolshevik October revolution, a festive season once marked with full military pomp but now graced only by a few rallies attended mostly by veterans, elderly nostalgics and neo-leftists. </p> <p>A bill currently before parliament would expunge the last vestiges of the \"great October\" from the calendar and shorten from two days to one the May Day holiday. </p> <p>The legislation would also throw out the December 12 holiday instituted by the former president Boris Yeltsin in 1993 to mark the introduction of a new constitution. </p> <p>The net bonus will be that Russians enjoy a longer Christmas and New Year holiday, when much of the country shuts down for a fortnight anyway. </p> <p>The October holiday has suffered an identity crisis not just as a result of the passing of the Communist era. </p> <p>Because of the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, it falls on November 7. It was rebranded the Day of Accord and Reconciliation eight years ago. </p> <p>The change, which will almost certainly pass into law during a first reading directly after this year's November 7 holiday, has broad backing and was only opposed by the Communist party. </p> <p>It marks the considerable redrafting of Russia's national image and history under Vladimir Putin, a vision that glorifies the rule of the tsars: the bill would also create a new holiday of National Unity on November 4, marking the day in 1612 when Moscow was freed from Polish occupation. </p> <p>One of the bill's proponents, Oleg Shenin, said that pro-Kremlin deputies \"openly say that we now have a new government which needs new attributes, including new public holidays\".</p>",
  "The FBI has begun investigating whether the Pentagon broke the law in awarding contracts in Iraq to Dick Cheney's former company Halliburton. <p>It wants to interview Bunnatine Greenhouse, a senior officer in the Army Corps of Engineers, who has publicly said that the corps gave contracts for which tenders had not been invited, worth billions of dollars, to a Halliburton subsidiary, her lawyer told the Guardian. </p> <p>The FBI is also collecting documents from government offices, AP reported. </p> <p>The FBI has already investigated some of Halliburton's Iraqi activities, but it is now treating the defence department's dealings with the vice-president's old company as a potentially criminal matter. </p> <p>Stephen Kohn, Ms Greenhouse's lawyer, said his client would cooperate, but must be protected as a whistleblower. </p> <p>\"If she is removed from her job, there will never be a full and fair investigation,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We've got a letter of commitment to that effect, and we hope that holds. But now that people know the FBI is involved they have even more of a motive [for retaliation].\" </p> <p>There should also be a congressional investigation, he argued. </p> <p>The corps of engineers, the government's main agency for major public works, said it was \"absolutely cooperating\" with the FBI. </p> <p>A Halliburton spokeswoman said the company was cooperating with several investigations, but blamed election politics for the revelations. </p> <p>\"The old allegations have once again been recycled, this time one week before the election,\" Wendy Hall told AP. </p> <p>Part of the evidence Ms Greenhouse submitted in her formal complaint was a Pentagon email in which an Iraqi contract is described as having \"been coordinated\" with Mr Cheney's office at the White House. </p> <p>The vice-president has consistently denied being involved in appointing the company, which has argued that it is the only one capable of doing the work required. </p> <p>In Iraq, as an advance unit from the Black Watch arrived at their new base south of Baghdad, more kidnappings underscored the absence of security. </p> <p>Militants said they had killed 11 Iraqi national guards in the south, showing footage on a website to prove that it had beheaded one and shot 10 others. On Saturday about 50 guardsmen were massacred north-east of Baghdad. </p> <p>Another militant group seized two truck drivers, from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Their demands are not yet known. </p> <p>Al-Jazeera television showed a video of a female Polish hostage, with a demand for the withdrawal of Polish troops from Iraq - a call the Polish government has rejected </p> <p>The Polish woman is said to have been in Iraq for many years and to have Iraqi citizenship, like the aid worker Margaret Hassan, who is still being held. </p> <p>But Polish officials said they had no record of her. </p> <p>\"The only Polish citizens in Iraq were those who had been married to Iraqi men and had been here for many years,\" a Polish official in Baghdad said. </p> <p>Iraqi officials said militant groups were intensifying their campaign of hostage-taking. </p> <p>Militants led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi are still holding a Japanese man, who they threatened to behead unless Japan withdraws its troops. </p> <p>\"For those foreign workers still in Iraq, the risk of being kidnapped is at all-time high,\" an interior ministry official said. </p> <p>On Tuesday, up to 20 insurgents attacked the compound in Baghdad where Kenneth Bigley was seized.</p>",
  "<p>Any gamer will tell you that today's release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a pop culture event on a par with the opening of a Star Wars film or the launch of a Harry Potter book. </p> <p>It is impossible to overstate the popularity of Rockstar Games' most valuable franchise - and it has been predicted that 4.5m units of this game - Rockstar Games' most valuable franchise - will be sold globally in its first week on the shelves. </p> <p>But what makes Grand Theft Auto so desirable and addictive? And is it acceptable to play a game in which you can get a prostitute to service you in her car, then shoot her to get your money back? </p> <p>Of course it is. GTA: San Andreas will inevitably attract attention for its violent content. It is set initially in the Los Santos gangland - a thinly disguised Los Angeles - and you soon find the character you play back with his old gang, the Orange Grove Family, and virtually eliminating a rival gang in a drive-by. </p> <p>But what makes GTA: San Andreas repugnant to some constitutes is its attraction to some , and not just real-life delinquents and sociopaths. The chance to perform actions that would, in real life, lead to the destruction of property, loss of life and jail time, is deliciously attractive. </p> <p>Who hasn't, after a bawling out from the boss, or an idle day spent pushing paper clips around their desk, fantasised about being Tony Montana from Scarface or Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver? The Grand Theft Auto games allow you to live out such fantasies without affecting anything other than a stream of data. </p> <p>But there is much more to the game than its inventively violent missions. The landscape spans three cities - Los Santos, San Fierro (an analogue of San Francisco, complete with gay policemen and Bullit-style missions) and Las Venturas (a virtual Vegas), as well as all the spaces in between. </p> <p>What sets these games apart is the ability to roam freely around the harsh but exciting environments. You can earn money by driving an ambulance or fire engine or by cat-burgling houses in rich neighbourhoods. </p> <p>My hairdresser, for example, a mild-mannered individual, completed the missions in Grand Theft Auto III, then obsessively spent two weeks learning to master a light aeroplane within the game. </p> <p>Working through the GTA: San Andreas storyline merely frees you up to hop in a monster truck and perform doughnuts in fields, or spend hours working as a pizza delivery boy. </p> <p>There are parallels with the success of the biggest selling PC game of all time: the Sims. This game, which gives you fine control over the entire lives of families of virtual humans, demonstrates beyond doubt that that the ability to live vicarious lives is central to the appeal of video games. </p> <p>Surely those who strive to do good in their day-to-day lives deserve, more than anyone, the chance to pop a virtual cap in some virtual ass when we feel like relieving our pent-up frustration? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Steve Boxer is a specialist games writer</p>",
  "<p>Eurotunnel, the debt-laden Channel tunnel operator said today it would cut jobs and services in a bid to boost margins as it unveiled its long-awaited recovery plan.</p> <p>The company, which is facing mounting interest payments on \u00a36.4bn of debt, said it was still in a vulnerable position and needed to reduce its debts. It is in talks with its banks about reaching a sustainable level of borrowing. </p> <p>\"A number of different hypotheses are being developed with a view to putting in place the appropriate financial and legal framework within which negotiations could ultimately be conducted,\" Eurotunnel said in a statement. </p> <p>Eurotunnel had until the end of the month to provide its bankers, HSBC and Credit Lyonnais, with a three-year business plan. The lenders have indicated that if they are dissatisfied with the plan, they could take steps towards seizing control of the business.</p> <p>Last week, the company - now controlled by a French board after rebel shareholders seized control at April's annual meeting - reported disappointing passenger numbers. It said operating revenue had slipped 4% to \u00a3140m in the three months to September, with the number of cars using its shuttles falling 5% and the number of trucks by 4%.</p> <p>Today's plan did not specify how many services would be cut or how many jobs would be axed from the 3,000 strong workforce. Eurotunnel said it was too early to give figures, although it did say it aimed to boost operating margins by \u00a370m by 2007 and change its truck shuttle service for road hauliers.</p> <p>\"These measures alone will not be sufficient to safeguard our future beyond the demanding challenge of the next two years,\" chief executive Jean-Louis Raymond admitted. \"In reality the financial structure of the group remains fragile and the high financial charges continue to impact on operating results.\"</p> <p>Eurotunnel has never recovered from the huge costs of building the tunnel and has been hit further by competition from budget airlines and price-cutting by ferry companies. The Anglo-French board was sacked in April after a 90% dive in its share price since flotation.</p> <p>Mr Raymond blamed last week's figures on the old board.</p> <p>\"These figures demonstrate that Eurotunnel 's previous strategy was not adjusted to market trends in terms of capacity and pricing,\" he said.</p> <p>Creditors are believed to be sceptical about the unorthodox new board, however. It includes a right-wing French MP, Pierre Cardo, and a former JP Morgan banker, Herve Huas, who is under investigation for money laundering.</p>",
  "Tony Blair's friend Bill Clinton rose from his sick bed this week to deliver a timely message to American voters: \"If one candidate is trying to scare you, and the other is trying to get you to think; if one is appealing to your fears, and the other is appealing to your hopes - it seems to me you ought to vote for the person who wants you to think and hope.\" <p>At the next election in Britain, however, it seems unlikely that too much hope will be on offer, at least from Labour. The cabinet yesterday agreed the legislative programme for the probable final session of this parliament. From identity cards to anti-terrorist legislation, it is likely to be dominated by fear. The Britain this Queen's speech will address appears to be a nation under threat from (in no particular order): illegal immigrants, rowdy youngsters, litter louts, liberal judges and organised crime. Oh, and a global terrorist network, too. After cabinet Mr Blair went on to launch another crackdown on a perennial enemy: yobs and nuisance neighbours. \"People are entitled to feel safe,\" he said. </p> <p>You do not need to subscribe to the whole conspiratorial thesis of the BBC's provocative series, The Power of Nightmares, to wonder then why Mr Blair continually emphasises threats. The sense of alarm was underlined by the newly appointed Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair (no relation), who in his inaugural remarks repeated the view that terrorists would attempt to attack Britain and announced that Special Branch officers would be abandoning their desks to track down al-Qaida in the streets of the inner cities. </p> <p>Terrorism is indeed a threat. It places a burden on the state that cannot justifiably be equated with the task of, say, promoting road safety (though the risk of dying in a car accident is greater than that of dying in a terrorist attack). But the atmosphere engendered by fighting terrorism may be almost as damaging to the principles that underpin liberal democracy. To compromise civil liberties as much as this government has done offers not only a kind of victory to the terrorists. It also contributes to a broader lowering of legal standards, an uncomfortable slide that links counter-terrorism legislation to other measures such as changes to court procedure intended to make it easier to secure convictions, or yesterday's extension of anti-social behaviour orders. In the name of security, the government magnifies the climate of terror. But it is far from proven that such an approach actually does as much damage to the terrorist threat as it does to the civil liberties of British citizens.</p>",
  "Thousands of parish council wardens are to be given powers to hand out fixed fines for litter, graffiti or noise nuisance offences in the drive against antisocial behaviour. <p>Tony Blair also confirmed yesterday that the government was looking at expanding the range of offences for which the police can issue on-the-spot fines to include criminal damage, minor theft and the misuse of fireworks. </p> <p>Ministers are also trying to find ways of giving civil courts the power to ensure that drug abusers who are issued with an antisocial behaviour order (Asbo) can be compelled to undergo drug treatment. Currently only those convicted of a criminal offence can be ordered to take a course. </p> <p>Dan Corry, of the New Local Government Network thinktank welcomed the proposed powers for parish and town councils. They knew best about the specific problems that affected their neighbourhood, he said. </p> <p>Mr Blair said legislation would be brought in as soon as possible. It is unlikely to be before the general election. </p> <p>The results of a national audit published yesterday on the first anniversary of the government's updated antisocial behaviour legislation reaching the statute book show that the police and local authorities took action in an estimated 100,000 cases. </p> <p>More than 2,600 orders have been issued by the courts since November 2003 which as many as in the previous four years put together since their introduction in 1999. </p> <p>Home Office figures also published yesterday show that 418 \"dispersal orders\" have been made to break up intimidating groups of teenagers so far this year and the courts have made a further 158 orders to close down individual \"crack\" houses. </p> <p>Mr Blair told a national conference in London marking the anniversary: \"For too long, the selfish minority have had it all their own way. That's changing. The fightback against the criminals, the louts and the nuisance neighbours is well underway. </p> <p>\"The new powers ... are making a difference. But we need more communities to use these powers relentlessly.\" </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said that only about half the local communities had dedicated antisocial behaviour teams and there were still too many cases where \"the yobbish behaviour of a few thugs is ruining the quality of life of whole communities\". </p> <p>Intensive antisocial behaviour pilots which have been running in 10 areas are to be expanded to 50 other towns. </p> <p>But Home Office research from the annual British Crime Survey shows that speeding motorists, illegally or inconveniently parked cars, and rubbish strewn streets cause most concern. </p> <p>More than 40% of people said speeding traffic was the biggest problem, 29% were worried about fireworks going off at nights, 28% about vandalism and graffiti and about teenagers hanging around. Only 9% said that noisy neighbours was a big problem. </p> <p>However, the research does confirm that in \"hard-pressed\" inner city estates people faced far more acute anti-social problems. But the government's drive continues to attract criticism within the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Rob Allen, director of Rethinking Crime and Punishment, said the ministers were placing too much emphasis on bans, injunctions and public identification threatened to create outlaws who had less and less incentive to conform. </p> <p>\"Pressurising local councils to impose more and more Asbos on young people will inevitably propel into prison some who breach the long and strict requirements. Locking them up does not sit well with the government's policy of reserving prison for the most serious offenders.\" </p> <p>Chris Stanley, the head of youth crime for the crime reduction charity Nacro, said there was little research available on the effectiveness of Asbos. But the government seemed intent on encouraging local authorities to dish out more by competing in Asbo league tables regardless of the long-term results, he said.</p>",
  "We are extremely concerned that, in the children bill currently before the Commons (Report, October 28), Labour MPs may not be allowed to vote freely according to their conscience on whether children should have the same protection as adults under the law on assault. Giving children such equal protection is a fundamental human rights principle - there is no excuse for the smallest and most fragile of people having less protection. We should not be put in the intolerable position of choosing between political principle and party loyalty. <p>There are many precedents for allowing a free vote on important matters of principle and conscience, including the votes that abolished corporal punishment in schools. </p> <p>All professional associations working with children and families agree that giving children equal protection is workable and would provide necessary clarity in the law. They also agree that anything less than equal protection would create legal ambiguity, parental confusion and professional uncertainty. </p> <p>In this context, the government's offer of a free vote on clause 56 of the children bill is an insult. This flawed proposal, which would continue to give children less protection, is both unprincipled and, in the view of child protection agencies, unworkable. </p> <p>We have been allowed to vote according to our conscience on protecting foxes. Protecting children properly is at least as worthy of a free vote. </p> <p>The fair and traditional way forward is a free conscience vote on giving children equal protection from assault. <br> <b>David Hinchliffe MP <br>Hilton Dawson MP<br>Julie Morgan MP <br>Win Griffiths MP <br>and 20 others</b></p>",
  "There is a chasm between the way parliament looks at legislation and how it should do so, the prestigious Lords committee on the constitution reports today. <p>The committee urges more public involvement in the scrutiny process, and consistent examination of the impact of legislation two or three years after it is enacted. </p> <p>\"We find it unacceptable that once legislation is passed it seems to go into a black hole,\" said Lord Norton, a political scientist and member of the committee. </p> <p>It welcomes the increasing provision of draft bills for committees to scrutinise, but says this should always happen.

  "Today in Rome the prime ministers of 25 European nations gather to sign up to a common constitution and to commit themselves to the same standards of human rights and democratic values. <p>Pause a while to contemplate the remarkable transformation of European politics which has made this event possible. Most of the countries sitting together in the same council chamber have been at war with each other in living memory, and repeatedly in the century that preceded it. A third of the states affirming the new charter of fundamental rights were satellites of the Soviet Union within the past generation, and denied both individual rights and national self-determination. </p> <p>Another two were victims of the last fascist dictatorships in Europe, and a third was ruled by a military junta. The evolution of our continent into a partnership of nations which guarantees human rights and banishes war is an extraordinary achievement, which previous generations would have regarded with envy. </p> <p>Yet how many voices will be heard in Britain hailing today's event as a triumph? Any brave soul murmuring that there may be something positive to be said for a Europe of peace and democracy will be drowned out by the blast of amplified heckling from the Daily Mail, the Murdoch press, and the post-Hollinger Telegraph. The Mail has dubbed the European constitution as the greatest threat to confront us for a thousand years. It takes a high degree of perversity to regard a charter of human rights as a greater threat to our country than the Norman Conquest, the Spanish Armada or the London Blitz. </p> <p>But their appeal to a past millennium betrays what drives their resistance to European integration - a misplaced nostalgia for the outdated world of freestanding nations. It is an era that has vanished. We are all interdependent now. The Eurosceptics bitterly complain that membership of the European Union requires us to compromise with others and to give up going our own way, but those are necessary conditions of life in an interdependent world. In truth it is not the rules of the EU that the Eurosceptics dislike, but the reality of that modern world. </p> <p>It is a paradox that the European constitution should have become the target for attack by those who complain most volubly about a slide into a federal Europe. They should be welcoming a constitution that delivers a hard knock to federalism and tilts the balance of power towards member states. The biggest innovation to the institutions of Europe will be a full-time president of the council of ministers based in Brussels, in place of the rotation of the presidency every six months between prime ministers based in the distant capital of their country. The new animal in the Brussels jungle will produce a further shift of initiative away from the commission and to the council, which represents the member states. In the argot of Brussels, the future direction of the EU will be less supranational and more intergovernmental. </p> <p>It is that kind of impenetrable language that has helped create the barriers between the European project and the people it is supposed to serve. Electorates across the continent do not feel they have ownership of the EU, and the scenes on television bulletins tonight may only serve to confirm their suspicion that it is the property of top politicians meeting in exclusive venues. Europe's leaders need to spend less time revising the rules under which they hold meetings, and put an awful lot more energy into convincing their voters that the outcome of those meetings is in their interest. </p> <p>Holding a referendum on the European constitution is not necessarily the smartest way of setting about that task. It runs the risk of confirming the stereotype of the EU as a remote body whose primary purpose is extruding lengthy texts rather than a valuable organisation to promote trade and jobs, protect the environment and raise standards of employee rights. </p> <p>However, defeat in the referendum would be a dire reverse in the long march to persuade Britain to be comfortable with its place at the European table. Most of the European constitution is not new at all. Three-quarters of it is a consolidation of all the European treaties going back over half a century. Vote no to the European constitution and you reject everything we have signed up to over a generation. A focus of the Mail assault has been the provision that European law takes primacy over domestic legislation, but that has been the rule ever since we joined in 1975. If Britain votes no on those grounds we are rejecting the very basis on which we became members. </p> <p>It is a chimera to imagine that we could then merrily continue to trade the great majority of our exports to the rest of Europe, while sidestepping any political cooperation. Telling the continent \"Get lost, but keep buying British\" is unlikely to work with our European neighbours. Nor should the Murdoch attempt to design a business Europe shorn of its social dimension have any appeal to the British left. </p> <p>This brings us to the positive reason why the left should welcome today's adoption of the European constitution. The progressive case for supporting the constitution is that it expresses values and goals of the European social model. It defines the values of the EU as \"respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights\". It sets full employment as a goal of the EU and commits it to \"combat social exclusion and discrimination\" and to \"promote social justice\". </p> <p>Its charter of fundamental rights embraces economic and social rights, such as limitations on working time, the right to consultation at work and the right to social security out of work. Indeed, one of the most bitter complaints of the right about the constitution is that it explicitly enshrines the right to strike. </p> <p>The strategic case for reaffirming those European social values is that for the past four years they have been under siege by a US administration which has demonstrated an evangelical zeal for reshaping the world in the image of Texas. The lesson of the recent past is that when Europe is divided its views can be ignored and its values can be undermined. The left, more than anyone else, should support a constitution for a strong Europe that can offer a multilateral partnership in place of Bush's unilateralism, and our social model as an alternative to his version of feral capitalism. </p> <p>Europeans have no vote in next week's presidential election. But we can at least vote on today's constitution, and if the US result goes wrong, it will be all the more important that we affirm our right to different European values. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:r.cook@theguardian.com\">r.cook@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Bjorn Lomborg, the controversial environmentalist, recently brought 38 top economists to Copenhagen to discuss the best ways of helping the world's poor. Most of their conclusions were commendable. Asked about the most cost-effective way to spend $50bn, the economists put control of HIV/Aids at the top of their priorities, reckoning that $27bn could prevent 28 million cases of HIV by 2010. Second, they allocated $12bn on micronutrients for the diets of 850 million people in chronically malnourished sub-Saharan countries. Third, more controversially, they decided to promote free trade - but since that would mean the end of agriculture subsidies it could free $250bn a year to spend on other things. </p> <p>The sting was in the tail. Bottom of their priorities for the human race came climate change, which they dismissed as a problem for the future rather than today. Would it were so. Yet global warming is like a slow heating kettle taking ages to come to the boil. The signs of warming we see today are the results of actions taken, or not taken, 30 years ago. Climate change that causes floods in some places and drought in others hurts the poor most, by depriving them of food and drinking water. Even if there were not a threat of global warming it makes sense to implement the Kyoto protocols. It is essential we use finite sources of energy more economically and think of our environmental legacy to future generations as well as facing today's problems. </p> <p>It is economic nonsense to suggest that there is just one pot of money from which all these things must be funded. There is no reason why the world cannot help the poor and fund a solution for global warming at the same time. There is a variant of Pascal's Wager at work here. Even if there were only a 30% chance that the global consensus of scientists was right in claiming that global warming could bring catastrophe, the consequences of doing nothing at all would be too horrendous to contemplate without first taking out a very hefty insurance policy. What is stopping us doing more to help the world's poor is not lack of money - it is lack of will.</p>",
  "<p>The public discussion over 4-D ultrasound images of the foetus has indeed been damaging (Women are eclipsed when the foetus is larger than life, October 27). Misleading ideas and, in some cases, simply lies, about what science tells us about foetal development are being circulated. It is obvious to any thinking person that a foetus cannot walk. But scientists know a lot more than this. They know that a foetus is not sentient, even at late gestational stages, and so cannot smile, laugh, cry or feel pain. </p> <p>The effect of misinformation is most apparent in relation to the impact it has had on discussion about how abortion law and policy should develop.

It is very unhelpful for those who may become parents to a very pre-term baby, and the clinicians who aim to help them, that these wrong impressions about foetal development dominate.<br><strong> Dr Ellie Lee </strong><br>University of Kent </p> <p>Anna Weyman draws our attention to the fact that babies born before 25 weeks are no longer resuscitated in Holland. It might be interesting in this connection to know that on October 15 in a written answer to Rudi Vis MP, Dr Ladyman stated that in the two years between 2001 and 2003 just over 1,000 babies were born before 24 weeks' gestation. How many of these survived even one year is not apparently known. However, he pointed out that a UK longitudinal study by the University of Nottingham, based on babies born before 26 weeks, showed that at two- and-a-half years, half the children of those who survived were disabled, and half of these were classified as \"severely\" disabled. The long-term medical and social costs of caring for severely disabled children in a country that is already short of 8,000 foster carers for abandoned children with no disabilities needs surely to be calculated by the Department of Health and fed into this discussion. <br><strong> Madeleine Simms </strong><br> London </p> <p>Anne Weyman writes that \"the pre-25 week foetus, as the Panorama programme demonstrated last month, has very little chance of surviving\".

  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday November 10, 2004</b> <br>  In the article below, we state that official figures \"show that 272,000 workers are paid illegally below the minimum wage\". The Office for National Statistics has asked us to point out that the number applies to jobs and not people; some people may have more than one job. In addition, the figures are not a measure of non-compliance with legislation - there are many exemptions from the minimum rate, such as apprenticeship, training or free accommodation, which are not measured in the survey.      What is the government going to do about growing inequality? Is there a plan for the third term? Although Labour has done well so far, it will for ever be running up a down escalator until it can start to shrink the gaps in pay and wealth it is trying to counteract. The measure of inequality (the Gini coefficient) increased between 1996 and 2003, and a new study by the LSE economist John Hills has just spelt out how hard are the choices that lie ahead for Labour. <p>Here is one small step the government could take. Yesterday the TUC put in its bid to the Low Pay Commission, calling for a modest 50p more an hour on the national minimum wage next October. That is not a lot, and the government should accept it. It would raise the minimum hourly rate to \u00a35.35 - still \u00a31 below the lowest estimate for a survivable living wage. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) released yesterday show that 272,000 workers are paid illegally below the minimum wage, over 1% of the workforce. </p> <p>The chances are the TUC won't get its 50p. The Low Pay Commission last year accepted exactly the sum the CBI submitted. The CBI has yet to publish its bid, but says it must be a lot lower than last year's 7% increase. Yesterday it called the TUC's 50p \"rash and unrealistic. The TUC has chosen a poor time to suggest throwing caution to the wind when so many firms are under pressure from rising costs.\" It's what the CBI always says. Its alarmist lobbying caused the minimum wage to be brought in at such a low rate that it has benefited about half as many people as the government originally intended. Every year the CBI cries wolf, threatening dire job losses - but every year the number of jobs rises, up by 2m now. </p> <p>Flat percentages are no fair way to look at pay: 7% of nothing much is nothing much, while 7% up at the top is a fortune. (What the top FTSE directors actually awarded themselves was even more: this year it was 13%, on top of 24% the previous year.) </p> <p>Pay is the great missing piece in the government's anti-poverty strategy. After seven years, like pulling dragons' teeth, it finally agreed before the party conference to give contracted-out public services workers the same deal as directly employed cleaners, cooks and carers. It will take a while to happen, but it rights a great wrong and will help a lot of the low paid, mostly women. Otherwise, Labour says nothing about how the pay and wealth gap is to be narrowed. </p> <p>The government has done exceptionally well in redistributing money towards low-paid families. Through tax credits, most experts agree, a million children have been lifted out of poverty - reaching the quarter-way target for abolition. So what's the problem? Why not just go on upping the tax credits every year? A New Policy Institute (NPI) report, Why Worry About Low Pay?, nails the issue. It makes the blindingly obvious (but officially unmentionable) point that tax credits have become a way of subsiding low-paying employers with ever heftier sums of government billions. What are we doing shelling out so much to keep supermarkets, private care homes and office cleaning companies paying rock-bottom wages? If there were no tax credits, all these employers would have to raise their pay or lose their staff, who couldn't afford to take jobs at these pay rates. The state is financing a low-pay culture. The CBI blusters on about keeping the minimum wage low - but it never utters one word of gratitude for the massive subsidy we taxpayers give employers so that they can pay sub-survivable wages. </p> <p>The chancellor's impressive anti-poverty record has been far more redistributive than most observers dared expect in 1997, and he has had to fight hard to keep that money flowing. Tax credits will always be needed as one way to make sure everyone, in all circumstances, is always better off in work. But, the report's authors argue, tax credits cannot be the main method for keeping most people out of poverty. Sooner rather than later, fair pay has to be part of the equation. Inching up the minimum wage as a weak backstop is not enough. A Labour government must have something to say about both gross wealth at the top and gross poverty at the bottom. The aim must be a living wage for everyone, without need of subsidy. </p> <p>There is no reason why a care assistant or a hospital cleaner is paid less than they can survive on. There is no iron market law: other countries have far less unequal pay rates. Look around Europe and countries make different political choices over the years, resulting in different tax rates, social benefits, levels of unemployment and in all (but Ireland) less inequality. There is no crude pay-off between fairer incomes and higher unemployment, as the CBI would have us believe. For a start, the state can set public sector pay at a living wage rate, if it is willing to raise taxes. Most private employers would have to match that. These jobs can't go abroad: they are virtually all in the service sector, and you can't have your granny cared for from Bangalore. How high can the minimum wage go without losing jobs? No serious economist says they can possibly predict it: suck it and see, they say. Keep pushing it up until it does demonstrable harm. The only long-term chance of zero child poverty is fairer pay. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in another neck of the woods - but not as far away as you might think - on Monday the gambling bill reaches the Commons. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport's latest rebuttal of \"myths\" about it is duplicitous nonsense. There is no point in pouring billions into an anti-child-poverty strategy when these gigantic slot machine sheds will make hundreds of thousands of children very poor indeed. Where do the millions of pounds come from that these great corporations are bribing local authorities with? Straight out of the pockets of a lot of addicted parents. These are not \"casinos\" - they are hyper-addictive 12 pulls-a-minute jackpot slots that transfix their prey, who are easily enticed in by free floor shows and free meals. Never mind if it is only \"20 to 40\" mega casinos to start with, these mega profits will mostly come from people who can't afford it. Very few people can. </p> <p>If these casinos are approved by parliament, in future years official poverty figures will need to add in many hundreds of thousands of hidden child victims of adult addicts. These children's household incomes may look high on paper, but their secret reality will be the worst poverty of all. It's no good Tessa Jowell saying it is \"snobbery\" to want to keep the same lid on this \"leisure industry\" as the rest of Europe does. Encouraging the most addictive type of gambling runs counter to all the other noble efforts the government is making for children. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Inequality and the State by John Hills, OUP; NPI report by Peter Kenway and Catherine Howarth </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>I thought I was a reasonably modern and open-minded sort of person. Cross-dressers, trannies, dads who turn into mums, men who dress as babies ... I can deal with all of that, no problem. But when it comes to kids, I'm a bit of a reactionary. Call me old-fashioned but I just feel more comfortable when boys are boys and girls are girls. Which is why I found <strong>Teenage Transsexuals</strong> (Channel 4) a little alarming. </p> <p>When 16-year-old Michael, who used to be Sarah, has to get his mum to help him strap down his breasts before going to school every morning so his friends (including his girlfriend!) don't find out that he's really a she, well I thought that wasn't really ideal. I found Michael's mother talking about \"his periods\" a difficult concept to accept. And I had a problem with Reggie's parents' eagerness to give their son/daughter hormone treatment before he/she had even reached puberty. </p> <p>In fact it was with Kris's grandad that I felt most empathy. He seemed a bit confused that his grandson was starting to turn into a granddaughter. \"I've never heard of it,\" he says, shaking his head. \"This is new.\" </p> <p>Fortunately for the children with \"gender-identity disorder\" featured in this programme, their parents seem to be more enlightened than me and Kris's grandad. \"We're losing our son,\" says Kris's mother. \"We're going to lose Kris and there's going to be someone else there. We've got to accept it and come to terms with who he's going to be.\" </p> <p>So Kris starts taking the hormone pills that will turn him slowly into Emma. And as he moves towards she, (s)he gets less moody, more confident and happier. So I guess it was the right thing to do. </p> <p>But then Kris was 18, and had known for many years that he was a woman in the wrong body. Reggie is only eight. That's too young, isn't it? Or maybe Kris's grandad and I need to loosen up our outdated ideas about gender. </p> <p>This was a good film - sober and tactful. Channel 4 even resisted the temptation to give it one of the sensational titles we've come to expect. In fact it was almost disappointing that they didn't call it something like My Girlfriend Thinks I'm a Boy. </p> <p>Nearly as disturbing, but at the same time a little bit brilliant, is <strong>The Swan</strong> (Living TV). Because of the constant need to up the ante in reality TV in order to keep it interesting, they've gone one better than Extreme Makeover. The Swan is not just about radically altering a person's appearance, it's about doing it to two people, then declaring one the winner. So it's a competition, too, with cash prizes. </p> <p>This is how it works. For each episode, two ugly ducklings are plucked from their miserable lives for three months. They're given nose jobs, brow lifts, face lifts, eye surgery, CO2 laser treatment, new teeth, new breasts, tummy tucks, liposuction, anything else that needs doing. Plus a bit of therapy and coaching to sort out any problems with self-esteem they might have, and presumably to help deal with the trauma of being turned into someone else. Then, at the end of the three months, it's time for the reveal - for the first time they can see the new them. The curtain is pulled away from the mirror and they get to sob \"Oh my God, thank you, I'm so beautiful.\" The team of plastic surgeons, cosmetic dentists, fitness coaches and therapists, meanwhile, is high-fiving, whooping and dabbing away at non-existent tears in the background. </p> <p>Then it's the competition part. They are judged on beauty, poise and overall transformation. One is declared the winner and gets to go on to the pageant and the possibility of hundreds and thousands of dollars, the other waddles back to her miserable life. Quite neat, then. </p> <p>The scariest moment last night was when Kristy, the loser, was reunited with her husband and daughter. \"Look, it's mommy,\" she cried, grabbing the terrified child. \"Oh, no it bloody isn't,\" said the look on the poor little girl's face. \"Who is this mad blonde monster with perfect teeth who's pretending to be my mommy?\" </p> <p>Oh well, maybe she gets a session with the therapist too. </p> <p><strong>Trouble At the Top</strong> (BBC2) really was a fairytale. Businessman backed by mysterious foreign consortium buys Luton Town football club for \u00a34 and it starts to fall apart. But fans fight back, helped by lovely club secretary Cherry. And it ends happily ever after - Luton win the opening game of the season 3-1 and now lie top of their league. Someone should make it into a movie.</p>",
  "<p>Once this too was the wild west. The red sky blazes over the mountains, the wide river reflecting its fire amid broken islands of ice. The train hurtles through the wilderness. But the mountains are the Catskills, more famous now for Jewish comedy than hunting, the river is the Hudson, and the train is a suburban service heading into New York City. It's a long time since the east coast was the western wilderness. To see it in that way, you have to go back to the 19th-century paintings of Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, who lingered in this landscape. The Hudson river school were the first artists to discover American space. In Cole's paintings, the Catskills represent untamed wilderness, all deep gorges, knotted forests, and never a glimpse of Mel Brooks. </p> <p>The image of the American wilderness began here, before going west with the wagon trains, after the civil war. Already, by the 1850s, Church was travelling to South America in search of more exotic panoramas. In 1859 he exhibited The Heart of the Andes in a darkened Manhattan gallery, illuminated by gas jets, surrounded by real tropical plants - there was a demand in New York City for these precociously cinematic vistas. By 1863 the German immigrant Albert Bierstadt was in the Rocky Mountains, portraying a Shoshone Indian camp beside a lake. The hide tepees in Bierstadt's painting form a simple and romantic human community nestling in a shady Eden beneath the sublime white peaks and dazzling waterfalls of the Rockies. </p> <p>Yet the greatest artist of the American wilderness, who drew deeply on Church and Bierstadt, was not a painter. The west's visual genius was the Irish-American film director John Ford. </p> <p>You see Ford's archetypal landscape in his great 1956 film The Searchers. Here it is white Americans who have created a little sanctuary in the middle of the wilderness; the farmhouse to which John Wayne returns after years as a Confederate soldier - and, it is hinted, outlaw - is a warm cosy interior. Outside is a bright, hard, empty nowhere; a spectacular wilderness of orange rocks sticking in the air like God's bones picked dry by the sun. And out there are Indians. Wayne is brilliant in The Searchers, his face a shard of stone, but the poetry of the film - of all Ford's cinema - is achieved through his unrivalled use of the American landscape. A new book on the director who defined Hollywood's wild west, from his early silent The Iron Horse (1924) through to his mythic masterpieces of the 1950s, demonstrates how Ford's films are steeped in precise visual quotations from the 19th-century artists who first invented the image of the west. </p> <p>After the defeat of the slave-holding south and the establishment by the civil war of the United States as we know it, Americans in the late 1860s wanted, to quote Mr Burns in The Simpsons, to wallow in their own crapulence - specifically, to conquer the western interior of North America. By 1869 the west and east coasts were joined when the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads were joined at Promontory Point. First on the trains westward were artists. The Hudson river painters had made America a fit subject for the gallery; photographers were employed to document the building of the continental railroad itself. The west was myth from the beginning. By the 1870s, the frontiersman William S Cody - Buffalo Bill - was wowing New York audiences and his Wild West Show would tour the world. Wild Bill Hickok joined him as a guest. Their lives were also chronicled in cheap novels and exaggerated biographies. </p> <p>Above all, the visual image of the west that was to shape Hollywood's most all-American genre was created by Frederic Remington, John Quincy Adams Ward, Charles C Schreyvogel and other illustrators of a picturesque and epic dusty emptiness where \"Red Indian\" braves with feathered headdresses and rifles eternally fight the blue-clad Seventh Cavalry. </p> <p>You can show, point by point, how immersed John Ford was in their art. Remington, greatest of the western illustrators in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, translated his paintings very profitably into bronzes that still fetch enormous prices; by the 1900s they were being bought by the Metropolitan Museum. Ford knew Remington's original paintings, less famous now, intimately. A still from Ford's My Darling Clementine has Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp on horseback in a pose that accurately repeats Remington's picture The Alert (1888). </p> <p>There is, however, one telling difference. It's true that Ford owes a great deal to western illustrators - after all, Remington died in 1909; Ford made The Iron Horse just 15 years later. There is no great chronological gap between 19th-century painting and the first silent westerns. But Ford is a far greater artist than Remington or Schreyvogel. His real genius is for landscape and his true tradition is that of the Hudson river school and, behind that, the European romantics JMW Turner and Caspar David Friedrich. </p> <p>In Remington's painting The Alert, the cowboy has stopped on a dusty, nondescript plain. You never see dusty, nondescript plains in Ford's films. When he repeats this figure in My Darling Clementine we see, looming behind Henry Fonda, the awesome outcrops of a lunar landscape: ancient surreal rock formations sculpted when the only Americans were dinosaurs. </p> <p>It's an unreal, phantasmagoric place, Ford's America: an unashamedly sublime, romantic, sinister spectacle. Above all, it is empty. Only the rocky pinnacles really seem to belong; both the whites and their native American enemies are just specks on the wilderness. </p> <p>Once, the Catskills represented wilderness. For John Ford, the place that mythically epitomised frontier life was Monument Valley, Arizona. This sandstone landscape is now, and was when Ford filmed there, a Navajo reservation. He employed the Navajo as extras, and was proud that he paid them good rates; he also helped them with food supplies in times of crisis and became a blood-brother of the Navajo nation. In his films almost all the \"Indians\" - be they Comanche, Apache, Sioux - are local Navajo. </p> <p>Monument Valley is far too wild ever to have been part of the history of American interior colonisation - it is barren, untamable; that's why it was made into a reservation. But Ford filmed there again and again, insisting that this lunar nowhere was the true America. He built temporary towns here, forts, homesteads. In My Darling Clementine, the town of Tombstone is unreally set against the sandstone fingers; the OK Corral is surrounded by cacti and space. In The Searchers, we are told repeatedly that Monument Valley is Texas. </p> <p>It all makes Ford's films a magnificent series of artworks, anticipating the sculptors of the 1960s and 70s who made earthworks and lightning conductors in the desert. Ford's insistence that Monument Valley is America is one of the greatest imaginative feats of his culture. But this is a harsh, empty, violent, tragic land-scape. Again and again, Ford uses landscape to communicate aching loss, despair and isolation. </p> <p>His westerns are the greatest and most influential ever made, yet they have more in common with later anti-westerns and spaghetti westerns than with the patriotic mainstream of the genre. Every story Ford tells is complex and unsettling. Take the gunfight, which became, in mid-20th-century westerns, a mythic test of manhood and courage. In High Noon, directed by Fred Zinnemann in 1952, sheriff Gary Cooper must stand alone against evil. Contrast Ford's story of the gunfight at the OK Corral in My Darling Clementine. The good guys include tubercular, drunken, depressed, morally ambiguous Doc Holliday. They fight not in the open but hiding behind fences, in a dust cloud, so they can't see who they're shooting. The men who have to be killed are not frightening so much as pathetic. A Shakespearean actor visiting Tombstone recites - at gunpoint - Hamlet's meditation on whether to go on living. </p> <p>But Ford's masterpiece is The Searchers. Here landscape is all. At the end of the film everyone is back inside a homestead. But Wayne barely enters before walking out again into the desert that is an image of his own inner life, consumed by racism and vendetta. He is last seen framed against the glowing landscape on a threshold he can never get back inside. For this revenge-obsessed American, there is no fulfilment. In Texas, they call this despair. </p> <p>John Ford and The American West, by Peter Cowie, is published on November 19 by Abrams at \u00a329.95.</p>",
  "<p>Colin Montgomerie has had what he describes as an \"interesting\" year, starring in the divorce courts, the Ryder Cup, the gossip columns and, more than likely, Weightwatchers' Weekly.</p> <p>The Scot, a Leeds United supporter with leanings towards Chelsea, who once looked as though he had eaten all the pies, has lost nearly three stone since the Open Championship in July and admitted that his self-esteem had gone up as his weight had gone down.</p> <p>So has his eligibility rating, now that he is divorced from Eimear.
